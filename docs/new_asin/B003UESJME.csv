4197491,4,B003UESJME,"Everybody is familiar with John Wayne's 1969 ""True Grit"" and people may be tempted to compare the Jeff Bridges/Coen Brothers/new ""True Grit"" but you can't say one version is better than the other, they're different, different visions for different times.

""True Grit"" (either version of the movie) follows Charles Portis'&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/True-Grit/dp/1585679380/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">True Grit</a>&nbsp;novel pretty closely. It's still the story of 14 year old Mattie Ross who's father was murdered and she hires federal marshall, Rooster Cogburn to bring the man who murdered her father to justice. And make no mistake about it, Mattie is out for vengeance against Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), given her choice of marshalls she chooses the one most likely to kill, Cogburn only brings his man in alive accidentally.

In the 1969 version you were aware you were watching a John Wayne movie, this ""True Grit"" is a western. Jeff Bridges submerges into Cogburn, his hair is dirty, he has the broken blood vessels in his face of a man who's drunk too much whisky, and Cogburn not only has trail dust on him, he's caked in the mud and blood of the trail. Hailee Steinfeld looks every bit of Mattie's 14 years and while her acumen about business matters is present we also see a girl thrown into a violent world she's not used to, Steinfeld's reactions are authentic to a 14 year old. Steinfeld's Mattie is more intense, and more realistic than Kim Darby's Mattie. The one question you have of Mattie though is, despite her precocity and determinedness to go with Cogburn into Indian Country would a men like Cogburn or Texas Ranger LeBeouf  (Matt Damon) allow her? Or would they be more likely to box her ears and send her on her way? I don't know if that question is answered in the movie.

""True Grit"" does stray a little from Portis' novel especially with LaBoeuf. The Coen's, for some reason don't have LaBoeuf coming along with Mattie and Cogburn for the entire journey and when they need him back it takes a little plot wrangling to get him back into the story where Portis had him all along. Some of the humor is also stripped out or subdued. I think that takes away some of the camaraderie present in Portis' novel (and Wayne's 1969 version) and leaves some doubt as to why Cogburn would allow Mattie to come along. In fact he does try to leave her behind but she catches up with Cogburn and LaBoeuf, who have struck up a deal of their own. The moment Cogburn agrees to take Mattie along is when LaBoeuf is spanking her with a switch. We also see Cogburn stop two boys from teasing a mule, is it compassion? We're not sure, it's never commented on and Cogburn doesn't show compassion in any other area of his life.

""True Grit"" is different from the 1969 version and hardcore fans of Wayne may not like this version, but the Coen Brother vision of ""True Grit"" is darker, grittier, and has a great sense of style of the tone of the movie with the cinematography. The Coen's ""True Grit"" is more realistic to the era; it's the flip side of Wayne's version but no less enjoyable a movie or story.",1292976000,5,3156,4.78348623853211
4197492,3,B003UESJME,"I am changing my statement I think the actors who play in this remake are cool so i give it up to the actors, good job, still got the western way and i liked it
some cool jokes, but still good story line and trying to keep the way john wayne did it",1292803200,5,248,3.69811320754717
4197493,2,B003UESJME,"I had originally wrote a review of this movie ""sight unseen"" without having seen it.
I did that out of a sense of ""outrage"" over the fact that Hollywood in its zeal to
remake classic movies, no longer seemed to be able to develop original movie ideas....and had even ""dared"" to remake a John Wayne classic! Well, I'm ""Calmer""
now....I saw this movie, agree that Jeff Bridges tried to make Rooster his own,
and still find myself biased for the original release....Guess I'm too much the oldtimer.... I don't think you have to make a darker version of something to remake it. I also don't think this movie had to be judged by how close it was to the book.
As an avid reader....I'd prefer to see my favorite books as movies with some ""twists"" on the story....even a complete retelling....That's the fun of books, you use your ""own imagination""....not Hollywood's. I didn't care for the ending or the gore....I felt this movie felt too much like ""Deadwood""....Love John Wayne!

4197733,4,B003UESJME,"This is the better film in comparison with the John Wayne version.  Jeff Bridges is a more nuanced actor than John Wayne.  To put that another way John Wayne brings very little acting nuance to his parts.  The cast in a John Wayne film is expected to orbit John Wayne.  In this 2010 Bridges film there are several very good performances.  That of Bridges is just one of them.  The plot does not suffer by being in service to one actor.  The actors carry the story forward with ease in the 2010 version.  The photography is great in the 2010 version.
One character that is stronger in the Wayne film is that of ""Lucky"" Ned Pepper portrayed by Robert Duvall in the 1969 film.  Pepper is the leader of the outlaw group to which Chaney flees after he has murdered Hattie's Father.  Duval brings a level of character portrayal and psychological nuance to the chief of the bad guys that provides full counterpoint to ""Rooster"" Cogburn, the character portrayed by John Wayne, chief of the good guys.
In the final analysis this movie is about vengeance in all of its remorseless monomania .  Yes, the bad guy deserved justice.  But the manner in which the bad guy receives the consequences of his action leaves the film with a sullen and cold ending.  I am left feeling regret and pity for the heroes and heroine.  I am not eager to see either version again.",1511568000,,1350,4.502057613168724

4197838,4,B003UESJME,"There is something to be said about a simple story told simply, especially when the prevailing trend is to make everything complicated, as if, somehow, movie makers had forgotten that often what is best is what is simple. The best stories rarely have to be sifted through too deeply: they reveal themselves perhaps not easily, but not arduously either; and one comes from them having taken in their creator's intention without feeling as if a mountain had just been climbed. This describes the Cohen brothers version of the 1969 John Wayne classic True Grit. Starring Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon, and Josh Brolin, it also features a teenage Hailee Steinfeld who superbly holds her own with the three accomplished veterans. True Grit is an uncomplicated tale about a girl attempting to bring her father's killer to justice, hiring a beaten down, drunken marshal to accomplish this. The child's resolve, scruples, savvy, and relentless pursuit of a single-minded goal are as admirable as they sound, and while watching her I couldn't help but think What if more of our little girls were like this one?...more of our little boys too?",1501113600,,1127,5.0

4197873,5,B003UESJME,"In a discussion of ""favorite Western movies"" with several friends one day, the subject of True Grit came up. My friends all said that the Coen Brothers/Jeff Bridges version was better than the John Wayne version. ""How is that possible?"", I said. ""A Coen Brothers' True Grit better than John Wayne? That's heresy!"" ""Watch it and you'll see"", they said. So, I did. And yes, they were right (in most points).

First, John Wayne's Rooster has more bluff-and-bluster and a bit more on the comedic side, while Jeff Bridges seems to play Rooster as a more tired, hard-bitten person. The only complaint I had about the movie was in the new version, Mattie Ross wakes up to find La Boeuf  (the Texas Ranger) sitting in her bedroom watching her sleep. This is not true to either Charles Portis' book, nor to how a Texas Ranger would have acted in the 1800s - going into a female's room unescorted. On the other hand, the episode where Rooster (in the Bridges version) is trying to get Mattie to help after being bitten by the rattlesnake - the cinematography of that scene, depicting the fear, desperation, exhaustion, and utter isolation - is simply stunning.

Finally, the musical score in the Coen/Bridges version is breathtaking, and pays homage to the simple hymns of the time. The music in the Wayne version was appropriate for the audience of its era, but seems dated and anachronistic now. That said, there's a place on my shelf for both versions, along with the book.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/True-Grit-A-Novel/dp/159020459X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">True Grit: A Novel</a>",1500595200,2,1623,5.187022900763359

Terrible acting by the little girl who is not even mention-able.  Poor acting by the lawyer is almost astonishingly poor.  It is hard to believe this type of 'tripe' is produced.  It is in fact naive, excessive, actors delivery (speech) is so contrived an unrealistic as to be nauseating; Bridges is way to obese (in fact, morbidly obese); the girl must have paid or knows someone to get the part.  AN abominable pseudo attempt at the original with acting that is beyond poor with a cast that must have come out of the bogs of a New Jersey swamp, including the hack Bridges.  He should have retired before making a fool of himself.  E.g.; Bridges moves so slowly (fat man) that he cannot accurately portray the part; the girl delivers like a 5 year old and is completely unbelievable.  Please compare this with quality acting: Dennis Hooper; Wayne; Campbell, Darby, Duvall, Martin;Ducett, ..are you kidding compared to Bridges and his hack crew!!

The original is far superior to the remake.  I had a hard time understanding Jeff Bridge's character.  While Kim Darby played her character to the limit of annoying, the new actress in the remake was tolerable and nowhere near as annoying as Kim Darby's interpretation.  The remake was also a little bit more violent, which was kind of a spoiler for me.  Guess I prefer the ""old school"" characters played by John Wayne and Glen Campbell (even though Glen wasn't much of an actor, he was better than Matt Damon).  Damon's outfit was over the top and not convincing at all, and I highly doubt if a man could just barge into a rooming house room unannounced, even in the ""old west"" days.",1497830400,2,829,4.493333333333333

4197941,5,B003UESJME,"This is better than the earlier version.  Jeff Bridges does a much better job than the Duke although Wayne was pretty good. Duke was a character, he was not an actor.  Greatly enjoyable but he always played the same man in different situations.
Hallee Steinfield was so much better than Kim Darby that I can no longer picture Darby in the role.
Even Matt Damon was a more realistic taciturn but pridefulTexas Ranger than pretty boy Glen Campbell.
And the Rooster's shootout scene with the five desperadoes was true to the spirit of the Duke in perhaps HIS most iconic gunfight in ALL HIS films. Bridges was just as exceptional presenting the duality of a hard ass/alcoholic as he was a offering a brain fried, past his shelf life hippie in ""The Big Lebowski""
Some of the best movie lines ever!
Rooster rides up to block the path of the departing desperadoes. Ned Pepper asks what he intends to do.
*** Rooster: ""I aim to take you back for trial""  (three of the five)
*** Ned Pepper (Robert Duvall '69/ Barry Pepper 2010):  ""Mighty bold talk for a one eyed fat man Rooster.""
*** Rooster: ""FILL.YORE.HAND.YOU.SUNNUVA.BITCH""
And like they say, the fight was on, 1 against five. And as Mattie Ross said,"" Rooster Cogburn, a man of no grit? He has TRUE GRIT indeed."" Better than Eastwood's  saloon gunfight in ""Forsaken"" but maybe not a lot.  BUT, I also rate Kevin Costner's bad odds gunfight in ""Open Range"" right up there near the best too!  Kevin Costner?  A California cool pretty boy surfer cowboy gunfight? Yep, go figure, its just my opinion but Duvall was his buffer in THAT movie and they had great chemistry despite him also BEING a character, not an actor, who played the same guy in every movie.  A surfer Yankee soldier among the Sioux in 1867 Montana? Hrrmph!

4198022,3,B003UESJME,"I thought this was in general a good effort at a genre film by the Coen Brothers, although I have to admit that you shouldn't watch this after 10 PM, because its ""methodical"" pace and Jeff Bridges' slurring speech might put you to sleep on occasion and then you have to rewind and find out what you missed, which tends to be not all that much. I'm docking this film one star because I've begun to notice a disturbing trend in the Coens' films: ugly stereotyping of Hispanics that ""confirm"" what bigots tend to believe anyways. In No Country For Old Men, ""Mexicans"" are portrayed exclusively as violent drug dealers or an ""ethnically-undetermined"" psychopathic killer. In The Big Lebowski, the Hispanic is portrayed as a ""typical"" sexual pervert who ""exposes"" himself to 8-year-olds and ""performs"" in sexually explicit ways that most Hispanic males would find laughable and offensive. In this film, Rooster Cogburn (Bridges)--who was a fictional member of a real-life outlaw Confederate cavalry gang that Civil War historian James McPherson has referred to as ""pathological killers""--comes upon two Mexican children (again the only ""Mexicans"" one sees in this film, while the two black incidental characters are portrayed as kindly to Mattie Ross) who are supposedly mistreating a donkey, and he cuts loose the animal and brutally kicks the children not once but again after he leaves their shack after presumably beating whoever was inside to retrieve some ""information"" about a gang of outlaws he is after. This is another ugly and false stereotype held by ignorant people. This behavior would have been more likely to have been done by (white) people for whom the animals did not belong to (like belonging to ""Mexicans""). It is very unlikely that that an animal important to the livelihood of poor people living off the land would have acted in this way, yet the Coens (who wrote the screenplay) once more showed their very narrow-minded and ignorant perspective, that in this day and age is the only thing that many ignorant, bigoted people know. There is a very fine line between racism and making judgments based on racial stereotypes.",1487980800,,2140,5.014044943820225
4198023,4,B003UESJME,"Enjoyed this movie!  Many of the lines were direct out of the original film, but there were different scenes which made the film entertaining.  Didn't agree with the directors decision to show rooster riding with Mattie on little blacker past a perfectly good horse standing next to Neds body.  The logic wasn't sound.  It would have been more reasonable for rooster to ride the idle horse and lead Mattie out on little blackie.  Two horses carry two people faster and further than one horse especially in life and death situations.  The scene makes rooster appear less experienced in the wild, less intelligent.  The scene is more dramatic as is, but it was an apparent oversite of the the director and others to show the other horse so easily available and unused by rooster.

I have seen many Coen brothers films to date, including ""Fargo"", ""The Big Lebowski"", ""No Country for Old Men"", ""A Serious Man"", and ""Burn After Reading"". ""True Grit"" was the first of their films to leave me disappointed.

The Coen brothers' trademark black humor isn't at the forefront here. Jeff Bridges' character is occasionally funny. But overall this is a dark and rather dry revenge story, with no real twist.

While the acting is quite good all around, and the casting is superb, the dialogue left much to be desired. The forced old west dialect is played out early on.

4198517,5,B003UESJME,"I love, love, love True Grit. It's beautifully made -- great lighting, cinematography -- and the dialog is hilariously witty and delivered so dry pan that it's made even more delightful.

Cross-examining Lawyer: So, you say that when Amos Wharton raised his axe, you backed away from him.
Rooster Cogburn: That's right.
Cross-examining Lawyer: In what direction were you going?
Rooster Cogburn: Backwards. I always go backwards when I back up.

To top it all off, the acting is first rate. Jeff Bridges makes an amazing Rooster Cogburn -- I was afraid he would just be Bad Blake in the West but not so; I did not realize immediately that LeBoeuf is portrayed by Matt Damon -- it's a Matt Damon I've never seen before, and has there ever been a funnier pretentious braggart of a Texas Ranger?; and Hailee Steinfeld is perhaps the most outstanding of all as Mattie Ross whose grit is truer than any man's.

Along the way, our little group also runs into the likes of Josh Brolin as Tom Chaney, the object of the search because he killed Mattie's father and she will not be deterred from her quest to see him punished; and Barry Pepper as Lucky Ned Pepper.

I love the characters' precise way of speaking, their beautiful diction -- an interesting touch I don't believe I've ever seen in a western.

LaBoeuf: You are getting ready to show your ignorance now, Cogburn. I don't mind a little personal chaffing but I won't hear anything against the Ranger troop from a man like you.
Rooster Cogburn: How long have you boys been mounted on sheep down there?
LaBoeuf: My shaggy horse will be galloping when that big American stud of yours is winded and collapsed. Now make another joke about it. You are only trying to put on a show for this girl Mattie with what you must think is a keen tongue.
Rooster Cogburn: This is like women talking.
LaBoeuf: Yes, that is the way! Make me out foolish in this girl's eyes.
Rooster Cogburn: I think she has got you pretty well figured.

Mattie Ross is so tenacious that were she to grow up and become a lawyer, I would want her to defend me if I got myself into trouble, or I would want her to prosecute if someone wronged me. I particularly enjoy the sequence when she negotiates with Colonel Stonehill to be paid for her father's stolen horse, to get the money back for the mustangs her father purchased from Stonehill, and then gets one of the mustangs back to ride herself.

Mattie Ross: I guess I have a $10 horse. Tell Col. Stonehill I said 'Thank you'.
Stableboy: No ma'am. He said he don't never want to hear your name again!

I have only vague memories of the original True Grit. It came out in 1969 when I was but a sniveling milk-fed pumpkin of a child. I know John Wayne finally won an Academy Award for playing Rooster Cogburn. The original made so little impression on me that I didn't remember much of what it was about. Merely recall Rooster Cogburn's eye patch.

So see the old movie if you want to make a comparison, but I don't know that I'd waste my time on it. Go with today's True Grit and God bless the Coen Brothers.

Rooster Cogburn: [LaBoeuf has been talking about malum prohibitum and malum in se] It astonishes me that Mr. LaBoeuf has been shot, trampled, and nearly bitten his tongue off, and yet not only does he continue to talk but he spills the banks of English.",1472947200,6,3327,4.475247524752476

Was the script written by a team of British alcoholics who wondered what cowboys would say in a Shakespeare play?  ""I do not knowith where art thou father's golden pieces, youngin.  Now wouldeth thou git yer sef home."" (in a garbled, barely understandable voice).  The 1969 film was made when Western movies were in great decline so the quality left a lot to wish for, which supports the need for a remake, but this 2010 version is so bad it is not worth the time to watch unless you can get if for free, and then only to prove to yourself that this sucks.",1470873600,3,790,4.304054054054054

4198545,5,B003UESJME,"If you were gonna remake the movie that snagged a best acting Oscar for John Wayne, you'd best come with legit creds - and True Grit, the 2010 flavor, does so. Spielberg exec-produced it. The Coen bros wrote, produced, and directed it. Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon, and Josh Brolin acted the hell out of it. And, even with all that high-powered shine, it was a 13-year-old girl that was the most gangster. No knock on Kim Darby - who was good and in her twenties when she played the same role in 1969 - but Hailee Steinfeld, in only her first significant role, submits a performance for the ages. She's the boss of the movie.

Seeking harsh Arkansas justice for the murder of her pa, 14-year-old farm girl Mattie Ross (Steinfeld) had the choice of three U.S. marshals: either the best or the best tracker or the meanest. It's a peek into what makes her tick that she selects U.S. Deputy Marshal Reuben J. ""Rooster"" Cogburn (Bridges), the meanest, most ornery one. Four years in his post, the Marshal's body count has numbered 12 or 15 or 23. Now, listen, John Wayne was such an iconic figure that when he played Cogburn, in the back of your brain, you were still aware it was John Wayne. Bridges sinks into his role until you forget there's acting going on. Coarse and cranky and weathered as ef, the marshal looks like he has a rank odor about him. Give Mattie her propers, not for one bit does she weaken on her resolve, although that fat, boozy, one-eyed specimen must've made a sorry sight. It's one of Bridges' best roles.

""They tell me you're a man with true grit,"" Mattie tells him. Still, Marshal Cogburn takes some convincing. But, at last, there he and Mattie go, braving the wild Indian territory where Tom Chaney (Brolin) - him what shot down Mattie's dad and stole his horse and two California gold pieces, besides - was rumored to have fled with ""Lucky"" Ned Pepper and his outlaw gang. Our pair find themselves somewhat accompanied by LaBoeuf (Damon), a Texas Ranger of mercurial disposition and constant braggadocio. LaBoeuf had been tracking Mattie's desperado for bumping off a state senator. He butts heads right away with Cogburn and with Mattie. LaBoeuf means to take Chaney back to Texas. Mattie insists that Chaney be tried in Arkansas. As for LaBeouf and Cogburn, it's that usual contest about whose junk is bigger. From jump, we're not sure what to make of LaBeouf. Matt Damon plays it coy. Is the Texas Ranger a braggy dork? Is he a straight-shooter? Or of a more sinister persuasion? For sure, Damon's take is more complex and layered - and more shady - than Glen Campbell's. Campbell was clearly more of a sidekick to Wayne. We're not ever sure what Damon is gonna do.

One day the Coen brothers woke up and put their quirk on hold. True Grit is the second and more faithful film adaptation of Charles Portis' 1968 novel. It is the Coen brothers' most straightforward, most dialed-down effort, almost as if someone dared them. And if someone did, oboy, did the Coens sure show him up. True Grit is a western masterpiece, and is resoundingly demonstrative of the Coens' artistry, quirk or no. As mileage will vary, it's up to you to decide your preference: the Duke's version or the Dude's. Putting aside their offbeat flourishes, the Coens present a viewing experience to be savored. They prove all over again that the western can be done right when in proper hands. The acting performances are universally terrific, some bordering on mesmerizing. The photography work is stunning in its depiction of the bleak landscapes and of nature's hostility and its imparting a sense of wild desolation. Those who chronically consult wristwatches tend to condemn bits of the movie for moving like molasses, but, me, the talky bits may be my favorite bits. There's a love of language the movie wallows in. The dialogue is brilliant and idiosyncratic and often amuses. And Hailee Steinfeld is brilliant, as I circle back to her.

Whereas Bridges nabs the more shiny, showy role, it's Steinfeld who anchors the movie. It's staggering that she was only 13 when she did this. Whether the movie triumphed or collapsed depended mightily on her, on whether you buy into her presentation of a farm girl with steely resolve and uncommon savvy and a take-no-prisoners tongue for horse-trading. Mattie all the time uses her words, and these are frequently barbed words because she doesn't ever mince them. And, man, she doesn't hesitate to cut down those who draw her ire, whether it's LaBeouf or that horse trader who comes to dread their encounters. Sucks for Cogburn, he's the one most often flayed by Mattie's withering smack talk as they are the film's designated bicker buddies. ""You do not varnish your opinion,"" she's told. ""You give out very little sugar with your pronouncements,"" she's told. But then, ""I admire your sand,"" she's told. Steinfeld is fierce, man. She steers clear of any opportunity to play it cute or precious. When I watched scenes of Lady Lyanna Mormont in action in GoT, I right away thought of Mattie Ross.

True Grit finds the Coen brothers in not as cynical or subversive a mood. And while I salivate at what the movie would've turned out like had they gone that route, I'm gratified at this interpretation. I love westerns, and this is a masterclass in how to make a great western. It's up there with Unforgiven in its examination of the grit and harshness and stark realities of livin' in the Old West. I fancy that, in real life, a Marshal of Cogburn's humor would present such a shabby appearance and such ill habits that would shock in polite company. A Marshal who roams from place to place wouldn't all the time be seen in pristine wardrobe or unblemished hygiene like them clean cowboys in the old movies. I imagine that Bridges' rough and seedy portrayal is very representative of the lawman whose badge wielded far-reaching authority in a time and place where, often times, law had yet to creep up, and it's up to you and your neighbor to uphold law and justice. It's amazing that, in such a feral era, young Mattie Ross kept pressing.",1470009600,2,6080,4.7105263157894735

The Coens have an almost preternatural affinity to Portis's writing and the acting, the writing, and sheer visual artistry are first rate.  I'm a big Coen Bros fan - but have occasionally been let down by some of their snark.  This movie has very little of it.  It's true to the story, mostly champions (or has empathy for) all of its characters - a true rarity for the Coens - and provides the type of movie experience that I keep bemoaning doesn't exist any more.  Well, here it is - and it's a great tale told with humor, pathos, gorgeous imagery, and superb acting.  Jeff Bridges is right on the money here, as is Matt Damon.

Jeff Bridges outdoes himself, and John Wayne, as Rooster Cogburn. The production is wonderful, the ""voice"" quizzical and self-aware.",1462838400,,256,5.2682926829268295
4198709,5,B003UESJME,"This is the third time that I have watched the Coen Brothers version of True Grit, which is more enjoyable with every viewing. As others have said, this film is a masterpiece of the genre that soars through the clear, excellent English spoken of a hundred-four plus years ago.

It is as much a feast for one's ears and a pleasure for one's heart to experience such articulate, descriptive language used by the most ordinary individuals portrayed in the movie. As I listened with deep pleasure to the nearly contraction-free discourses, utter one - such as ""wouldn't"", instead of ""would not"" - it was a jolt. How easily we can become accustomed to the beauty of clear speaking without feeling as if it is stiff or stilled.

Hailee Steinfeld spoke the words so easily, with no hesitation or effort, that one might think this as simple to her as speaking Greek or Hindi. Even though she began acting in commercials and short films in grade school, this movie was her first major production. She was extraordinarily natural in her portrayal.

The small screen (even one that is 40 inches) does not do justice to the immense power of the story, the scenery, and the strong actors who serve the story. Jeff Bridges is a powerhouse and is better as he grows older. As so with Matt Damon, who was so invisible in his role that my son-in-law thought I was mistaken when I remarked how well he had done in the film: ""What are you talking about; he wasn't in this film!"" Yet, Hailee, was just as strong and persuasive at every step of the way. Points, also, to Barry Pepper as Lucky Ned in the story. Even though a villain, he was not a thoroughly bad man like Tom Chaney. Each time he is on screen, I wonder why such a thoughtful, well-spoken individual got caught up in the dark side.

I loved the first film with the Duke playing Rooster Cogburn; in this version, it is so easy to forget who the actors are and to only see the characters. It is fascinating to see that Domhnall Gleeson, who is poor, lost Moon, dying so tragically in True Grit is now a leader - temporarily - as General Hux in Star Wars IIV and IIIV.

This is my favorite Western along with Lonesome Dove.",1462320000,,2164,4.454545454545454

The 1969 movie was driven fully by Rooster Cogburn. This 2010 version is truly driven by Mattie Ross. The performances by Stienfeld, Bridges, and Damon shine.

4198809,5,B003UESJME,"We were purists.  We thought nothing could be better than the original.  Not true.  We love this version!  The dialogue is a delight!  It appears the writer and director were operating on the premise that people of that era wouldn't have used contractions (I mean would not have used them:).  So the dialogue takes on a cadence that is unfamiliar to the modern ear but thoroughly delightful.  Barry Pepper is truly disgusting as the bad guy.  How did they get his mouth and teeth to look so horrible?!  And the way he spat when he looked down at his 'victim' eww!!  Jeff Bridges plays a terrific, sort of pickled Rooster Cogburn.  I am not in the least a Matt Damon fan, but he plays his role as a Texas Ranger to perfection.  It's not clear at any given moment whether we should be laughing at him or rooting for him, so we have to wait and let the movie play out to arrive at our answer.  And this girl; I don't know where they found her, but she absolutely makes the movie!  She's not at all irritating like the girl in the original version.  Her character comes across as very capable, very determined and very likable!  If you're a fan of westerns, you need to add this to your collection!",1457827200,11,1194,4.359090909090909

  I was amazed at how closely it kept to the original lines of the first version (The John Wayne version).  Some of the scenes repeated the initial text verbatim.
  In the original version, the words were great, but because they were spoken in modern dialects, it kind of hid how brilliant the writing was.  In this version, it seemed that they tried to be truer to the mannerisms of the 1800s.  It really brought in a new level of depth to it.

4199131,5,B003UESJME,"We Western fans can be a very forgiving bunch when it comes to modern Westerns- there are so few of them that sometimes we just have to make do.

We classic movie fans can be a bitter lot, constantly decrying the many pointless remakes lazy people foist upon us and that seem to be more prevalent than anything original these day.

The Coens were a breath of fresh air in the 80's and 90's and they are national treasure and maybe America's best filmmakers now.  If you have to do a remake, 'what better hands to put it in?' was my initial and skeptical thought.  I needn't have worried.  This movie surpasses the original in every way.  And I say this as a HUGE John Wayne fan.  His performance in the original was great.  It wasn't the best he'd ever done (The Searchers or Red River for the range or Rio Bravo or The Quiet Man for the heart- all are stronger) but he'd been taken for granted for so long by the cognoscenti that he was awarded Best Actor as a kind of culminating sympathy prize for a role that admittedly stood out from his others that decade.  The problem with the original is pretty much everything else.  While taken on their own terms, the direction is fine, Kim Darby is grating but fine, the music (with the exception of the TERRIBLE opening and ending credits Glen Campbell tune) is serviceable, and Glen Campbell... no disrespect to the man as he seems happy to be there, but... he seems happy to be there.

Let's get this out of the way first:  Jeff Bridges is not John Wayne.  And he isn't trying to be.  Instead, he's a grizzled old curmudgeonly son of a ***** named Rooster Cogburn.  There is no Jeff Bridges here.  And his relationship with Haley Steinfeld is believable, magical and a kind of love story.  It made me understand what this story is really trying to say.  Matt Damon is doing something he's never done before- and surrendering himself entirely to a character at the service of the relationship between Rooster and Mattie.

The direction is beautiful, quirky, uniquely the Coens, and totally understanding of the genre.  The music is beyond wonderful.  Old Protestant hyms arranged for piano as the undercurrent to what's driving this story combined with full orchestral arrangements of Western movie motifs that would make Elmer Bernstein envious.

This is all to say nothing of the many wonderful characters that populate this world.  Barry Pepper is no Robert Duvall but captures the strange mix of sympathy and menace that a character only in the movie for 5 minutes can afford.  Josh Brolin is only in the movie for a short while as well, but uses that time to make Tom Chaney so off and so scary that you understand all the fuss that's been made about him the whole story long.

So see the 1969 True Grit for John Wayne when the mood strikes you.  Or better, watch one of the great John Waynes instead.  The 2011 True Grit will reward your time as a Western worthy of one of those.",1448409600,,2933,4.516129032258065

4199423,5,B003UESJME,"Jeff Bridges, as Rooster Cogburn, is simply wonderful, much better than was John Wayne in the original.  The girl is also wonderful--determined, intolerant, stiff-necked and more.  She will go to the ends of the Earth for extract justice for her murdered father.  It is a love story of the most unusual kind.  Rooster comes to genuinely love the girl in the sense that responsibility and self-sacrifice are what love is all about.  He sacrifices for her and, if necessary, he will die for her.

I think to extract the real juice from this film, the viewer must be intimate with the events of the Civil War.  The Texas Ranger was regular Confederate Army and Rooster was 'irregular' Confederate army and fought, tooth and claw, alongside Bill Quantrill in Missouri.  It was a vicious, brutal war in Missouri where neighbor murdered neighbor and Quantrill scoured his frightful enemies from the surface of the Earth.  Cogburn is one of Quantrill's men, much to the Ranger's sanctimonious contempt.  We see the Quantrill Bushwhacker in all his glory when Cogburn whips his horse into Ned's band--reins in his teeth, both hands shooting pistols--Cogburn is the same Confederate raider that he was as a young man.

The last part of the film is arguably the best when the girl--now a middle-aged woman--goes to the Wild West show where Cogburn is performing.  She meets the now ancient, Confederate bushwhackers and outlaws--Cole Younger and Frank James.  It is truly something to see.",1439510400,,1479,4.987755102040817

The story limps along, the girl playing Mattie is far from convincing, and Jeff Bridges, really?  Normally I like Jeff but not here.  The director fudged on so many good scenes -- when Mattie rides Liittle Blsckie across the river, not sure how they kept that horse's head up to make him look like he was struggling.  Horses are very good swimmers, and if you watch the original, that is how a horse swims.  There seems to be no connection between Matt Damon (who is notorious for picking bad roles, The Brothers Grimm, need I say more) and Jeff Bridges.  The actor who plays the villain doesn't even have a patch on Robert Duvall.  The original is chilling.

4199698,5,B003UESJME,"Full disclosure: I have neither watched the original film starring John Wayne nor read the Charles Portis novel on which it is based. Still, the Coen Bros. adaptation is a strong film in its own right and is filled with their trademark humor, has an outstanding score and soundtrack, and of course as excellent performances across the board. TRUE GRIT tells the story of Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld), whose father is gunned down by Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin). In order to catch Chaney and bring him to justice, she enlists the aid of US Marshal Reuben ""Rooster"" Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), who possesses ""true grit."" There is also a Texas Ranger (Matt Damon) who tags along with them and serves as competition for the reward money. One thing I expect when I watch a Coen Bros. film is a story in which people start out with good intentions, but through error or misfortune see their plans undone. With TRUE GRIT, they seem to have dialed back the noir a little bit and gone with a more straightforward story, albeit with some meandering. If there's one element aside from the performances that really stands out, it's how well written the characters and dialogue are. So even though the plot does stall a little bit at times, I never really minded because the characters were so interesting. It also helped that the film is quite funny, with Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon and Hailee Steinfeld some often hilarious barbs at each others' expense. As far as performance goes, Jeff Bridges does a good job as usual as the cantankerous Rooster Cogburn, but to be honest he could have played this role in his sleep. The real standout of the cast is Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie Ross, who imbues her character with just the right amount of spunk and vulnerability. She also knows her way around the legal system, which comes to her advantage a lot. Also worthy of mention is the score/soundtrack. Generally speaking, all of the scores and soundtracks for Coen Bros. films are excellent, and TRUE GRIT is no exception. One recurring bit that I liked was a piano version of the gospel song, ""Leaning on the Everlasting Arms."" Lastly, Roger Deakins' cinematography was beautiful and did a wonderful job of showcasing the Western landscape in which the film takes place. My only gripe is that once the film arrives to the third act, it prolongs it a little more than I would have liked. There is also an epilogue which didn't necessarily have to be there, although it did make some sense to have a look at Mattie grown up since she narrates at the beginning. Overall, TRUE GRIT is an excellent film that lives up to what the Coen Bros. have done before. It's not quite their best ever, but its definitely the best thing they've done in the past decade.",1427241600,,2730,4.6777546777546775
4199699,3,B003UESJME,I liked the remake of true Grit. Maybe it's the fact that I saw the movie years after it was released. But it was worth the film it's printed on.,1427155200,,145,3.8666666666666667

4199701,5,B003UESJME,"True Grit
 It is a truism in the movie biz that there is only one reason to do a re-make of a previously made film, that is to make a better one.  There are films that are so well done in their original guise that we never expect them to be re-made.  They are considered perfect in their original production, impossible to be improved upon.  They are considered to be Classics.  True Grit, the 1969 western which gave John Wayne his first and only Academy Award, is among these classic films.  The 2010 Coen brothers version of this classic western is, against all odds, even better than the original.
 The script, co-written by the Ethan and Joel Coen (who are also the co-directors), closely follows the original.  The personal story of Matie Ross (brilliantly played by new comer Hailee Steinfield) is expanded somewhat, but the story and much of the dialog has been transferred almost intact from the earlier film.  The improvement is in the direction and the quality of the acting.
 Jeff Bridges, who won the Oscar for his role as a country singer, has a good shot to get back to back awards.  After all John Wayne received is Oscar for his performance and many think Bridges interpretation of the Rooster Cogburn iconic character is more emphatic and satisfying.  I am in this camp.  Hailee Steinfield as the officious fourteen year old Mattie Ross is without peer.  The viewer aches to see the young girl using her school marm strictness as courage to mask her terror in a life and death situation.  Seemingly broad, her acting is actually subtle and very deft.  Matt Damon is unrecognizable in his role as La Boeuf, a Texas Ranger who helps track down the outlaws.  It is not fair to compare his magnificent and successful effort to the amateur playing of Glen Campbell in the original film.
 The co-directors bring out the inherent humor in the script.  The Victorian style of restrained, polite humor",1426809600,,1910,4.698795180722891

Everyone I know that had seen the original first likes it is better including myself, but I tried showing the original to the people that had seen the new one first and I even got embarrassed by how cheesy the original gets. Nobody can outdo John Wayne as Rooster but that is because of how much fun it is to watch Wayne playing a drunk fool.

That being said, I nevertheless think that the character of 'Rooster Cogburn' was better defined by Jeff Bridges than by the 'Duke'. The 2010 version of True Grit is just a better movie. I also happen to like the traditional Appalachian rendition of the traditional hymn 'Leaning on the Everlasting Arms' as heard in the movie.",1422057600,,402,4.52054794520548

4199795,5,B003UESJME,"How do the Coens keep doing it? Their singular oevre includes films in nearly every genre you could imagine--from violent mystery to screwball comedy to imaginative retelling of myth. There is a deep love of film making that drives them and the result is never dilettantish.

Here we have a Western than rises far above the norm.  The characters are beautifully drawn and perfectly cast.  The look (especially on Blu Ray) is genuinely sweeping. There are wonderful little set pieces (I wish I could bargain for a car the way Hailee Steinfeld bargains for a horse). But at its core it's a quest.  A strong girl turns into a stronger woman and a cynical drunkard recovers his humanity. The bad guys don't do so well.

But the most striking and beautiful part of the film is the language.  It's a very formal sort of English: a little archaic and without contractions or colloquialisms. It carries the deeper meanings of the characters, all without feeling forced.  I've never heard dialog like this outside of Shaw or Shakespeare.

I hope I'm never forced to choose a favorite from the Coens. But this would be among them.",1421539200,,1120,4.737113402061856

4199921,4,B003UESJME,The JOhn Wayne TG and this one are different movies and I like them both for different reasons.  I liked John Wayne's interpretation of Rooster beeter than Jeff Bridge's.  John Wayne's had some whimsy to him that made him more likeable and personable.  I never cared for Kim Darby's character but preferred Hailee Steinfeld's acting.  It's also hard to top Strother Martin in so many roles he's done.  I liked them both but would lean towards the Cohen Brothers.  Matt Damon had more depth and humor to his character.  I really like the authenticity and overall timbre of the Cohen's movie based on the overall improved acting across the breadth of characters.,1418860800,,660,4.839285714285714
4199922,5,B003UESJME,"Epic in the best sense. One gets a sense of the vastness of the West, one threatens to swallow up the puniness of human kind, and yet the story portrayed here is big enough to contend with the landscape. Deserves all of 5 stars, for acting, cinematography, music.

Regarding others comparisons with John Wayne. JW only ever played John Wayne. I found the original True Grit a  bore and could not complete it. Jeff Bridges is fully Rooster Cogburn, and by staying in character adds to the movie, fills it with a full presence, rather than trying to use it as another vanity piece.",1418774400,,579,4.5576923076923075

4199975,5,B003UESJME,"Good stuff, great stuff, this version of True Grit will probably survive as one of the all-time classic Westerns. I started out giving it 4 stars because it is still ""new"", just changed it to 5, my gut instinct is it will stand the test of time.

Jeff Bridges plays this one to the hilt as a grizzled bounty hunter. First time I saw it I thought he overplayed it, now I see that he completely possesses the Rooster Cogburn character and does not exceed what it demands. A wonderful performance, thoroughly entertaining and deep.

This is a ""road picture""; an unlikely trio of seekers, including a teenage girl on a mission to avenge her father's death, and upstart Texas Ranger Matt Damon, are all in pursuit of outlaw Josh Brolin for different reasons. The arcane language is brilliant, the dialogue is as if from an old novel, charming and seemingly authentic to the period. Haven't read the book but this version, presumably the language as well, is purported to be closer to the bone than the John Wayne version. The writers and the Coen Brothers have excelled in creating a vintage illusion and the clothing, sets, staging also contribute mightily to the gritty feel of the Old West.  For a Western to be made in 2010 with instant classic written all over it is no small feat.

Bridges could have won the Oscar for it, he was nominated, but he had won the prior year for Crazy Heart. Still, Little Hailee Steinfeld emerges here as a talent to watch, she truly possesses True Grit. Great story, great performances, a movie movie up there with Hollywood's best.",1416441600,4,1564,4.635379061371841

Bridges and Brolin were particularly impressive (Damon's character was less impactful, for me), as was the young woman who played one of the lead roles. The story of a washed up drunk who finds redemption, of a sort, is always fascinating to me. Also, while I am not a particularly major fan of Westerns, this one ranks among those that I not only enjoyed but would watch again (just as I would with Eastwoods Unforgiven, Tombstone, and others). I think, in time, it may find itself climbing its way up the list of the top Westerns of all time; certainly in the Top 25 for me.

I wish he would have just spoken the lines as written,  his attempt to appear extremely sullen and speak  was not his best work... I was surprised  the C brothers let  the spoken dialogue become so hoe-key.  Its happens when Yankee actors try to hard to sound  like a southern nadir-do-well.  One thing  that  the Co brothers  chose to do more realistic, the film makers surpassed the first film by  filming  the  location scenes  that resembled  east-stern Oklahoma  high plains ....

4200134,5,B003UESJME,"True Grit is the 2010 remake of the classic John Wayne western directed by the Coen brothers.  I haven't seen the original film so I won't be comparing the two and just judge this as its own piece.  I haven't seen too many Coen brothers movies, but the ones I have Ive enjoyed.  I love No Country For Old Men.  In fact, its one of my favorite films.  I like The Big Lebowski but I don't adore it like most people seem to.  Ive also seen this film obviously and Ill say this is a really good one.  There will be minor spoilers so be warned.

The story follows a teenager named Mattie Ross.  One night her father was killed.  Mattie seeks to track down his killer with the help of a U.S. marshal named Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) and another lawman named LaBoeuf (Matt Damon).

The characters are fun and quite interesting.  Besides Matt Damons character these aren't your typical band of heroes in a western.  Mattie is very cold, intelligent, and very determined which is very rare in a child character in a film like this.  Back in the Wild West women didn't really go on manhunts or acted this way so its probably not that realistic.  However, at least its different, and its much better than having your typical whiny kid around thats just here to get kidnapped, whine, or try to be funny.  She can get annoying at times with that attitude though which brought the film down a bit for me since shes the lead, but it doesnt ruin her character.  Plus, the actress, Hailee Steinfeld does a great job acting-wise.

Rooster is an old drunk whos basically given-up on everything and just waists away.  Hes a lost soul who cares nothing about his actions but does try to do the right thing on occasion.  Hes not really heroic but still sympathetic enough as well as fun to watch.  Im not a big Matt Damon fan but I think this is one of his better roles.  Its fun to see these characters interact as they go on their adventure.

The film looks beautiful as well.  The look of the Wild West and the countryside is just stunning.  The action scenes are pretty fun too though there aren't that many.  The music is fine.  Its nothing great but it gets the job done.  The acting is also on-point.  Everyone gives a great performance especially Jeff Bridges.

I especially love the ending.  This mainly because its not an ending we typically see in these types of movies.  Its not a downer ending but its not happy either.  Its years later and we see that Matties vengefulness has led to her feeling very lonely and empty.  We also find out that Rooster has died in a very sad way.  It wasn't an honorable death at all.

Overall, True Grit is a great as a western and as a film in general.  The film looks, fantastic, has fun characters, has a stellar cast that gives great performances, and has a different but good ending.  No Country For Old Men is still my favorite Coen brothers movie so far, but this is a close second.",1409529600,,2917,4.383177570093458

4200154,4,B003UESJME,"Ive never been a John Wayne fan Did I lose any readers with that opener? Sorry but I always feel like hes playing well John Wayne. So when I
heard a reimagining of True Grit was coming out, I wasn't all that interested. The 1969 film won John Wayne an Oscar. But when I heard the remake was
from the Coen Brothers, I was mildly interested. Having seen the film now four times (yes, all in the theater paying full price), you could say Im somewhat
of a groupie.
The first thing you notice about the film is its amazing attention to detail. Some will criticize the film for its languagenot that there was any cursing (there
was none) but that the phrasing was awkward and sometimes difficult to follow. But you won't hear my say that. Remember, Im a groupie. To me, the
films use of language was as important as its choice in props used to give us a sense of the past.
True Grit tells the story of a 14 year old girl Mattie, played masterfully by Hailee Stienfeld, hires a drunken, run down US Marshall (Oscar-worthy
performance by Jeff Bridges) to bring in her fathers killer (played by Josh Brolin). The two get some unwanted help from a Texas Ranger (Matt Damon) to
track down the killer, who is running with outlaw Lucky Ned Pepper (played by Barry Pepper).
This film was marked by gold standard acting performances by the entire cast. And the Coen Brothers have once again proven that their style of filmmaking
and storytelling is among the best in Hollywood. Just out of curiosity, I did rent the 1969 original and was impressed by how much of the original was
mimicked in the remakebut with more than 40 years between them its difficult to compare the two side-by-side. In the original, Glen Campbell played the
Texas Ranger and a very young Robert Duvall as Ned Pepper.
So do I recommend the remake of True Grit? Well you might be okay with just one screening.",1408406400,,1866,4.475073313782991

While both of the True Grit movies had great casts, I really liked Jeff Bridges and Hailee Steinfield was amazing. Both Matt Damon and Josh Brolin also did fine work.

4200284,3,B003UESJME,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I have to disagree with Rene Rodriguez of the Miami Herald who downgraded 'True Grit' slightly because of what she terms ""the prevailing lack of Coen-ness in the movie."" In fact, that's precisely why the movie worked a lot better than many of their previous offerings (usually involving trashing one of their prototypical straw man anti-heroes as well as reveling in their ubiquitous 'glass is half-empty' philosophy of life). The Coens have been quoted as saying that they approached the True Grit source material quite reverently, based on Charles Portis' 1968 novel, ""with its emphasis on adventure and quest.""

As usual the Coen cinematography and set design is excellent, creating a much better look to the old west, than the way it was depicted in the first True Grit vehicle, starring John Wayne. Except for the ending and a greater emphasis on Mattie Ross (focusing on the clever 14 year old, as the story's main protagonist), both versions pretty much followed the main plot points as found in the novel.

I found this 'True Grit' to be mildly interesting but often slow-moving. It takes quite a while before 14 year old Mattie conscripts Rooster Cogburn, the 'meanest' US Marshall in the west, who will eventually track down Chaney, the man who killed her father. Joining them along the way is LaBouef, the Texas Ranger played by Matt Damon, who is also seeking Chaney for the killing of a Texas State Senator. When Mattie objects to LaBouef and Cogburn agreeing to bring Chaney back to Texas and not to her hometown to stand trial for the murder of her father, she receives a whipping from LeBouef. Cogburn intervenes, preventing LaBouef from inflicting additional punishment, and he then leaves.

Although one of the strong suits of the film is the dialogue which features interesting local references, it's often hard to understand much of it, as Jeff Bridges has a tendency to mumble his words. The Coen brothers are determined to make this True Grit more 'grittier' and play up the violence. Cogburn is not politically correct when he gruffly tosses two Native Americans off a porch as he looks for an outlaw, Ned Pepper, and his gang, who are reportedly traveling with Chaney. When he finds two outlaws, Quincey and Moon, in an empty dugout, Quincey cuts off Moon's fingers and stabs him in the chest, to prevent him from talking, with Cogburn forced then to dispose of Quincey.

Most of the rest of 'True Grit' is perfunctory. Ned shows up with his gang and Cogburn kills some of them with his shotgun, saving LeBouef in the process (who showed up earlier, right before the gang comes on the scene). Eventually, Mattie is kidnapped by Chaney, Cogburn kills most of Ned's gang, but is saved at the last moment by LaBouef, who shoots Ned, from a cliff, 400 yards away. Oh yes, Mattie eventually kills Chaney but falls into what looks like an abandoned mine, only to be saved by Cogburn after she's bitten by a rattlesnake.

True Grit has its moments, but there are really few surprises overall, in this average tale of a teenager's desire for vengeance. Much of the conflict stems from the tension between the perspicacious Mattie and Cogburn, who is often befuddled by the tenacity of such a female. It works occasionally because it's nice to see such a macho character as Cogburn, get his comeuppance. But Cogburn is also such a one-note character, that the machinations between the two principals, begins to grow tiresome. As for the plot, it's basically a tale of the good guys dispatching the bad guys (with antagonists who aren't particularly interesting). The film might have worked a bit better if we arrived at the climax a bit sooner.

The Coen Brothers did well in adding on the ending which is found in the novel but not in the 1968 film. We see Maddie (sans an arm due to the snake bite) now as a grown woman, looking for Cogburn, but tragically misses him by only three days (Cogburn, employed at a circus, dies right before Maddie can find him). After all the excitement, Maddie ironically turns out to be a spinster, in her adulthood (no CGI effects here folks; the Coens actually did a nationwide search and found a one-armed woman, who could play the part).

Perhaps True Grit's main problem is that it's based on source material that has quite a bit of realistic dialogue but no real twists and turns in the plot. I liked Hailee Steinfeld as the new Maddie, as she provides a more 'serious' approach than the Kim Darby version in 1968. As for Jeff Bridges, some have said he's guilty of overacting; I leave further evaluations for the pundits, although again, I think he could have done better in annunciating his lines a bit better. Damon fails to bring anything distinctive to the thankless part of LaBouef.

In the end, True Grit pretty much is an average western, featuring better than usual dialogue as well as a great deal of impressive cinematography. For once the Coen brothers decide not to stand above the fray and expect to be congratulated for shooting down one of their usual straw men. This time, they've done an honest job in attempting to adapt someone else's material. Not all of it works but one can say it's mighty nice to look at--and that's no small feat.",1403481600,2,5252,4.743702081051478

4200317,5,B003UESJME,"I AM a bit favorably biased toward anything the Coen Brothers do.

However...I honestly feel this version of True Grit is just as good if not better than the orginal True Grit. For ME anyway. In different ways of course. This movie pretty much follows the same general path as the first True Grit. But the very different ending is what truly sets it apart from its predecessor. It's more...realistic....grittier...given the times the story was set in. The ending is the best PART of this film. It MAKES the movie. It left ME with a sense of....satisfying sadness...in a story honestly told. Had this movie ended the same way as the first...it would have simply been a decent 3 star remake.

I get the distinct impression the Coen Brothers main objective and motivation in making this film was to create the totally different ending to their satisfaction...then simply backfill the story...with a few different twists and turns...to support and lead up to it.",1398816000,,958,4.871165644171779

4200319,4,B003UESJME,"I may be the only person on the planet who didn't see the original so I was free to just enjoy this without making comparisons.  I loved Jeff Bridges as Rooster; to me he carried the film.  Matt Damon was lame but perhaps that was part of his character.  Josh Brolin was wonderful in the few scenes he appeared in.  The weakest link was the girl who played Mattie and this was an important role.  It seems to me that they could have found any number of young actresses who could have done a better job.  She tried very hard to play plucky but  that was about all she could muster.  It didn't help that she wasn't very likable either.  The cinematography is wonderful and I loved the music.

The Blu-Ray transfer is very good, with nothing to complain about at any point. Whether it is worth an upgrade from a DVD copy is really a matter of personal preference, but it is certainly worth a few extra bucks instead of a DVD copy.",1397692800,,453,4.1477272727272725
4200324,3,B003UESJME,"I know opinions vary widely on this, but I'm sticking with the John Wayne version. The scene where he tells the girl about ""taking the reins in my teeth"" and charging a whole posse is a whole lot more believable from John Wayne. He gets excited telling the story. Jeff Bridges just sounds like he's reading a cue-card. Near the end, when Rooster Cogburn has to put his words into action, and actually charges the four outlaws, John Wayne's charge is simply superior.

Also, John Wayne can actually carry the girl to safety when she's ill from the snakebite. Jeff Bridges only pretends. Watch closely. You never actually see Bridges carry the girl.

All that said, I really like this girl better than the girl in the original movie. Too bad she wasn't around when John Wayne needed her.",1397088000,,785,4.640287769784172

What would the Cohen Bros do to this  do that hadn't already been done? Well, as it turns out, quite a lot. This is a worthy re-imaging of the original novel. This is an excellent ensemble performance by a *stellar* cast with top-notch production values from front to back. Great performances, cinematography, film score, editing -- really a gem of a film which looks and sounds great on Blu-ray! Why it didn't garner a string of Oscars is beyond me. It was nominated in 11 categories and should have won them all.

So, if you've ever drunk water from a muddy hoof-print and were glad of it -- this is for you. The rest of you as well. Great film -- enjoy!",1395878400,,763,4.328671328671328
4200355,4,B003UESJME,"If you like the Coen bro's, you'll in all likelihood like this treatment of C. Portis novel.  The Coens put a stamp that is uniquely theirs, and I like their movies.

This flic is a far cry from the humorous, rousting John Wayne movie.  The dialogue is oddly stilted, makes me wonder how cowboys and such really spoke back then.  Anyway, for whatever reason, the dialogue is what it is.  Slightly distracting at times, but generally unobtrusive.

A young girl's father is murdered, and she goes off in search of a man w/ true Grit, to help track the murderer down.  She finds such a man, and off they go.

The fact of the matter is it's Mattie Ross with the true grit quality; her quest for justice is unrelenting.

SPOILER ALERT, BEWARE!!

I found this to be a very sad movie.  I have trouble deciding if it's the Coens love of black humor, or their accurate depiction of life as it really is, at least sometimes, that influences their treatment of this story; but it doesn't have a happy ending.

I think there is a lesson to be learned here...get it while you can, whatever your dreams may be; the end comes way too fast, as Mattie quotes in the end......."" time just slips away from us""....Make your life full, be brave; grab your opportunities and don't let go.

The movie ends w/ Iris Dement's plaintive rendition of  ""Leaning on the everlasting  arms....""...the Coens might be laughing their a's off, but the movie really made me think of all the lonely people (Credit to the Beatles); but mostly about the ones who don't have to be alone, but choose it.....and live an old age of regret.

4200479,3,B003UESJME,"I liked this rendition of True Grit. Too much time was spent with the young girl, Matte, bargaining at the beginning to find a bounty hunter and to raise the money to pay him. Jeff Bridges was good in this rendition and so were all the other actors and actresses. The movie was kind of slow but was never boring. The end was stupid though. They could have made a much better ending. Haul Ned and Chancey back to Judge Parker and keep the cave and snake and Cole Younger out of it. Indians could have tried to take Ned because he was a bad guy for a long time. Snakes do not come out in the winter and why the need for a dead guy in a cave?

Too little time, actually none, was spent developing the bad guys, Ned Pepper and Chancey. They came across as good guys mostly. Too little non action sequences spiced with action sequences.

I saw the Original many years ago and thought this would be better but this new version may not be as good. I ordered the original from Amazon and  when it gets here my wife and I will make a comparison.",1389744000,,1036,4.144278606965174

4200483,5,B003UESJME,"True Grit a remake of the 1969 classic western by the great Coen Brothers (Joel and Ethan). For the most part the film plays like a straight western, though there are a couple quirky Coen moments thrown in which appear like the blackened brand on the rump of a grazing steer.  Its always nice to find a directors brand.

The film takes place in the fall of 1877 and tells the story of Mattie Ross, a fourteen year old who is so clever that shed leave Tom Sawyer holding the paint brush and so tough that she could take out Huck Finn with one arm tied behind her back (therein, dear reader, lies a veiled reference to events late in the film, and no there isn't a Huck Finn cameo). Matties father has just been killed by a hired hand and Mattie has been sent to identify the body and then, against her mothers wishes (no surprise there!) to hunt down the killer. Yes, hunt down. Mattie is not content to hire a bounty hunter (though she does that). But she is determined to go along for the ride to ensure that her father and his killer both receive justice.

Here kudos go to young Elizabeth Marvel who is outstanding (I was going to say shes a marvel but then I decided not to, except that I just did) in the role of Mattie. While Marvels performance is a real standout, that is to take nothing away from the rest of the stellar line up. Jeff Bridges is amazing as Rooster Cogburn, the bounty hunter Mattie hires to kill her fathers murderer. Matt Damon is also excellent as the Texas Ranger LaBoeuf and Josh Brolin shines like the mud-spattered spotlight on a red neck pickup as Tom Chaney, her fathers killer.  (And let us not forget the underappreciated Barry Pepper who excels as Ned Pepper.)

All throughout the film Mattie is on a quest to see Chaney hanged. But not just hanged. She wants him hanged in Arkansas. And she wants him to know why. Mattie is driven not by a blind rage but rather by a desire for retributive justice distilled and poured with as much care as the best backwoods moonshine. She is a teenage embodiment of the Count of Monte Cristos maxim revenge is a dish best served cold except you can drop revenge and slot in retribution  or justice.

This clearly is a world of retribution, an eye for an eye. And in the end Mattie is the one who kills Tom Chaney with her own fathers gun. So where is the satisfaction from this exercise in just retribution? In a moment Chaney disappears over the cliff and just as quickly the recoil of the gun sends Mattie backwards and down into a cave. Inside the cave there is a corpse with a snake and in a moment Mattie is bitten. The irony is heavy given that the whole film they have been careful at night to protect the campsite from snakes. So why the bite and why now? And why does she lose an arm from the bite? And why do we keep hearing that old gospel hymn Leaning on the Everlasting Arms?

I am not sure whether the film is an unqualified indictment of retributive justice, but it certainly could be viewed that way. An eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind. Or it leaves one person over a cliff and another deep in a cave. As for the bite of the snake, is this an echo of the serpent in the garden? Did Mattie fall for the serpents call to play God by exercising retributive justice instead of forgiveness?

It seems to me that the films pivotal climax comes in the moment when Chaney and Mattie meet. After hunting him for days Mattie happens upon him at a river. It seems to me that the river is a profound clue here of another decision that Mattie could have made. Could it be that with both standing ankle deep in the water, this was the moment when she could have extended unmerited forgiveness instead of pursuing her quest for just payback? Wouldnt you have loved to see Chaneys face if she had declared Tom Chaney, I came all this way to say I forgive you.

Why the river and why restorative justice and forgiveness? Consider the opening verses of Revelation 22 which feature a very different Edenic image with a river but no serpent, and at last no retribution:

And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.

In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.

For the healing of the nations. For Matties father. For Mattie herself. And yes, even for Tom Chaney.

[Correction: After I had originally posted this my friend Tim Wilson pointed out that I confused my Matties. The actress who played Mattie as a grown woman in the film was Elizabeth Marvel. The young Mattie, the really impressive newcomer, is named Hailee Steinfeld. Watch for her.]

I've read numerous reviews in newspapers, and I agree with all of them--you can't beat Jeff Bridges and the trio that acts with him on this.  The Coen brothers have a gritty (sorry about the pun!) take on this story, and it resonates strongly with reality and simplicity.  The stark cinematography of the Oklahoma landscape in winter makes you feel the cold and snowflakes.  The quirkiness of their various encounters lends a sincere instability to their circumstances.  The energy put into the characters by Bridges, Damon, Steinfeld, and Brolin keeps the action moving at a fast clip, no time to get bored.  I also loved Barry Pepper as Lucky Ned.

4200586,5,B003UESJME,"Jeff Bridges is always a treat.  I still think his best performance ever was in 1984's ""Starman"", but he does a bang-up job as Rooster Cogburn.  As I stated in the review of 1969's True Grit, he plays Cogburn in a much more deadpan fashion than does John Wayne, but it works anyway.  I've read the book, but I read it after seeing the 1969 version, so I read Cogburn with Wayne's humor in my head.  It's hard to think of him 'deadpan' -- but Bridges's Cogburn works; the whole movie works.  Matt Damon is GREAT as the verbose and pontificating Texas Ranger.  But Hailee Steinfeld steals the show.  She rules as the precocious Mattie Ross, driving the movie and keeping you eager to see her in the next scene.  There was only one thing I didn't like (but it's hardly important to the whole movie):  the person who played Mattie in later life (at the end of the movie) just didn't work; my husband and I both thought, ""there's no way that girl would have grown up to look like that.""  People don't change THAT much.  The casting people should have made more of an effort to find someone who looked more like the young Mattie; it just didn't work.

4200657,5,B003UESJME,"I find this rendition to be much better than the original with John Wayne, though I hope that won't be seen as heresy.

I liked the original film, but the ubiquitous reputation of the authentically minded Coen Brothers did such an outstanding job with this remake, that I truly believe it surpasses the other in spades, juxtaposing itself with another favorite of mine, ""Tombstone,"" (1993).  Having worked in film, I look at things a bit differently than the average viewer, and when I examine this 2010 version which I've now viewed twice, this film just gets it right.  Costuming was extremely rich, authentic, and spot on, dialogue truly 19th century, cinematography/location just...porn for the eyes, to say nothing of very correct period selections in firearms; 7.5 Peacemakers, 12 ga. coach guns, 1873 Winchester rifles, 2nd Model Colt Dragoon pistols, Ned Peppers 1875 Remington, and even a 45/70 Sharps carried by Texas Ranger LaBoeuf.  And what about those wooly chaps of Lucky Ned?  Just outdamnstanding AND authentic.

And then, there's the closing.

How it wonderfully smites the viewer with melancholia....stroking the chords of it with a finely tuned collaboration between the Coen brothers and Carter Burwell (Blood Simple, Barton Fink, Burn After Reading, Fargo, The Hudsucker Proxy, Intolerable Cruelty, The Man Who Wasnt There, Millers Crossing), intentionally drawing on a selection of 19th century Protestant hymns throughout and in conclusion.
Flashing forward to the end credits, watching an adult Mattie walking across an open prairie (and out of our lives) to the exquisitely haunting voice of Iris DeMent as she sings ""Leaning On the Everlasting Arms"" strikes the soul, adding icing to an otherwise richly layered cake, holding closer in this viewer's opinion, to the intent of this wonderful novel written by Charles Portis.

4200659,5,B003UESJME,I read the book years ago and was a big fan of the original True Grit so I went into this movie with a mindset already. I was surprised how well the mental picture I had matched the movie I saw. In some ways it was more true to the book but there was a few scenes added for no real reason I could see. They didn't move the story line along and were not in the book. It was like they needed to add a few more minutes to get something contractually complete. I know movie making is more complex than the general public knows. It was still a great movie. The Blu-Ray was vivid and came with some cool extras.,1375315200,,605,3.9672131147540983
4200660,5,B003UESJME,"Many times a movie that goes through a remake is only a shadow of the original. That is not the case here. Of course John Wayne carried the original version and Bridges is not him. Aside from that, every aspect of this rendition is better than its predecessor. Matt Damon plays his role so well that it makes Glenn Campbell look like he was drafted straight from Jr. High drama class. Forgive the insult to Jr. High aspiring actors. Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie absolutely knocks it out of the park. She steels the show early and everyone plays catch up for an hour and a half. Josh Brolin is a perfect as Chaney. Whoever had the idea to cast Barry Pepper as Ned Pepper was a stroke of genius. The dialogue is brilliant, the acting is stellar. The Coen brothers put and exclamation point on an already prestigious list of accomplishments. I have watched both new and old repeatedly and honestly enjoy this version more than the original.",1374624000,,935,4.571428571428571
4200661,5,B003UESJME,"The script is masterful. With a poetic style of dialog, one is transported to ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" meets the wild west. The young girl searches for someone with true grit, but in the end we discover it is her who displays true grit. Suffering from a snake bite, she is carried in the arms of the main character before he and the horse, give out. Twenty five years later she stands at his grave side recollecting how she lost her arm but not her life. Through out the movie, you hear the theme song ""Leaning on the Everlasting Arms"", being played on an acoustic piano. Not until the end do you hear the actual words being sung.

True Grit shows how many people don't especially care for one another, but really do need each other.",1374624000,,736,4.372262773722627
4200662,2,B003UESJME,"The Coen Brothers' 2010 remake of the novel and film True Grit was yet another example of the film industry's aversion to risk.  Why try something new when one can simply remake a well-known commodity?  The industry's logic (we can no longer refer to it as ""Hollywood"") is to ""Keep doing it 'till you get it wrong.  And the new Grit is well-crafted and intentioned, but wrong. While not the putrid mess that Gus Van Sant's remake of Psycho was, the new Grit also begs the question: Why?

Since this film wouldn't have been made, save for the popularity of the John Wayne version, comparisons are fair and inevitable.  The new version suffers when measured against its predecessor.  I'm surprised to feel this, since I am not an admirer of John Wayne.  Moreover, Jeff Bridges has earned respect over the years, displaying versatility that his actor father and brother could never dream of.  Nevertheless, Wayne's performance was strong and affable, whereas Bridges' was strained and overly-affected.  He was like a stage actor drawing whispers from the audience that ""He's trying too hard.""

Matt Damon, another actor who has brought many solid performances to the screen, is at his worst in this film.  The Bostonian simply has no idea how to play a Texan.  He was more at home portraying an Afrikaaner in ""Invictus"" than here.  It doesn't help that his costume is ridiculous; it looks like a tenderfoot maxed out his credit card at an LL Bean before going out on a camping trip.

The new Grit's great strength is its ""Western Gothic"" visual style which has become the norm among modern genre productions.  Unfortunately, the Gothic look, with its nearly-colorless chiaroscuro style becomes tedious after awhile.  One longs for the rich fall colors of the earlier film.

The Coen Brothers conceded in passing what many reviewers have not; that the new Grit has lost much of the humor of the novel - and by extension, the Wayne version.  Sensibilities have changed since the Sixties.  The original novel and film were built around snappy rapid-fire verbal fireworks.  The post-Seventies filmmaking style stresses pseudo-documentary touches that dismiss crisp dialogue.  The Coens - and their actors - simply are unequipped to fully appreciate and adapt the crisp dialogue of the original to their sensibilities.  The new Grit's version of the famous horse-trading scene is the best case in point; whereas the original film brought a smile to the audience through Strother Martin's increasingly flustered delivery, the remake seems like a tedious waste of time.

The new Grit's Maddie also suffers in comparison to the original film's Kim Darby. Though perhaps the new performer is more age-appropriate, she is tone-deaf to the character's peculiar personality.  She may adequately portray pluckiness, but lacks the precocious horse-sense required of the part.

As the villainous ""Lucky"" Ned Pepper, a young Robert Duvall showed great presence in the original film, whereas in the remake, the actor merely mouths his lines in a rushed delivery that shows he doesn't feel up to the task.  It is a small but important part, and requires a strong actor to carry it.

Only in the final scene is the remake in its element.  Its bleak, nihilistic denoument fits modern Westerns well, and would have been unwelcome in the Wayne version.  The best moment in the film is the closing credits shot; Iris DeMent sings a quirky but affecting version of ""Leaning On the Everlasting Arms.""  But in the end, the new Grit is a successful film because the Coen's flaws are the modern audience's flaws, and match them well.

Sigh.",1374624000,,3609,4.974958263772955

Schindler's List, Shawshank Redemption, Apocalypse Now are members of this elite list of titles that cannot and should never be remade.  True Grit with John Wayne is such a movie.  I refused to see it in the theatres and refused until today to watch it on TV.  Not only could it not hold a candle to the original, but it wasn't a good movie on its own.

Jeff Bridges, to me, completely ruined this movie for me.  Besides not being a good actor to start with, he is incredibly hard to understand; I realize he's playing a drunk, but if you can't understand what he says, then what's the point?!  Damon and Steinfeld made passable substitutions for Campbell and Darby, however the whole thing was wasted on me because of the epic fail from Bridges.

There are two horrible things I will mention about this trash:

1. The new version added in a gratuitous race card. Cogburn abuses Mexican children for the sake of abusing Mexican children. What purpose does this serve the movie? None. But it does serve the political machine that is Hollywood to denigrate the white male -- especially one who carries a gun.

2. A very different Matty from the great original. The new Matty is a self-indulgent spoiled brat who thinks the threat of bringing down the evil Gloria Allred can solve all her problems. This is not what make a woman strong, it is what make a woman a pathetic, cowardly, malignant narcissist.

Then again maybe Bridges character was so interesting in True Grit only because the young spunky girl Hailee Steinfeld was so interesting. They complemented each other like black coffee and cheesecake or a cold malt and a hot slice of just-off-the-grill medium rare steak. Matt Damon's absence & presence and absence & presence, and alternating butting heads then tacitly agreeing with either character added interest to the mix, like a side order of fries.

I saw this twice in theatres. The first time, I fell asleep. The second time, I just didn't enjoy it. I thought Matt Damon's performance in particular was bothersome. It was probably more the character than him.

I purchased this when it was extremely discounted because I'm trying to collect Best Picture nominees, and I didn't want to pay too much for a film I didn't enjoy.

Well, I don't know what changed between viewing #2 and #3, but I really enjoyed it when I watched it at home. I probably didn't enjoy the theatre viewings because movie-going audiences in my city ruin everything.

This is a well-crafted film. The Coen Brothers are at their dramatic best. Roger Deakins deserved a myriad of awards, but unfortunately he was up against Wally Pfister's work for Inception.

The script is both typical and atypical Coen Bros.; they don't have too many movies like this, but there is a level of comfort involved.

While there are good performances, Hailee Steinfeld is the true star here. It's not only that she just holds her own but also emerges as her own force.

4200764,4,B003UESJME,"Interesting film in that this is probably the most straight forward project the Coen brother have ever made. It's certainly a solid piece of film making, but I believe it falls rather short of the Coen's crafty uniqueness and originality that have made their films unlike so many others. The style here is more basic and predictable by the usual Hollywood style, and generally what you come to expect from a big Hollywood production. I do have a few minor gripes though. Firstly I think Josh Brolin's character has such a small appearance, and that's just plain sad because he was so great in No Country for Old Men, as he is in many of his performances. Here he is given little opportunity to shine due to a role that has rather sparse requirements. Bridges is pretty great as Cogburn, but this performance is nothing to rave about. it's also pretty common in it's execuation by Bridges. I don't think the character is one that could ever win mass raves, but that being said it's certainly good. The real gift in this film is clearly Hailee Steinfeld, who is simply genious in her role, more than well deserving of an oscar nomination. She is simply brilliant, and her performance is really the only truly beautiful thing about this film. This is clearly no 'Unforgiven' Or Wild Bunch, but it's still a pretty good western. Though I expected more Coen magic and originality, which is evident here and there, but over all this film on it's own merits works very well, but again, falls short in the area of Coen genious as we have seen it before.",1367625600,,1545,4.601449275362318

4200829,4,B003UESJME,"The Coen brothers' 2010 remake of ""True Grit"" is a Solid Western. Although it's hard to beat John Wayne and the charm of the '69 version, I might like this rendition a little better, mainly because it's more gritty realistic. I suppose you could say it has more, well, grit. But they're both great or near-great films.

Hailee Steinfeld is outstanding as the educated and headstrong 14 year-old Mattie Ross. Jeff Bridges is excellent as Rooster Cogburn, the one-eyed, overweight, hard-drinkin' Marshal with true grit. The former hires the latter to apprehend the scumbag (Josh Brolin) who murdered her father. Teaming up with a young Texas ranger (Matt Damon) who's also tracking down the owlhoot, the three go into the wilderness of the Choctaw Nation of Eastern Oklahoma to apprehend him, where they're also forced to contend with the outlaws with whom he's riding. Barry Pepper plays the leader.

It's interesting -- but fitting -- how Mattie's disposition remains intact as she grows older. You could say she's unlikable but Cogburn won her respect and you have to admire her life-long loyalty, especially since he's not the most savory individual.

The locations are less spectacular than Wayne's version (which was shot in Colorado and California) but they're closer to the actual locations of the book and therefore more realistic. Besides, they're awesome in their own mundane way.

The film runs 110 minutes and was shot in East-Central Texas (Granger & Blanco) and Buena Vista Ranch, New Mexico.

It didn't make me feel as if I were part of the times which is one of the intent of the writer.

I saw an article recently titled ""The Greatest Book You've Never Read"", the fact that the novel was made into a movie so quickly overshadowed it, but it too is a classic. What many reviewers comment on as 'mistakes' by the Coen brothers, are in fact them staying true to the novel. Powerfully in the decision to use narrative the opening scene (as it is in the book). The courtroom scene is lost in the original, it has no real purpose - here it gives us a powerful sense of the time; dark brooding men, dressed in black in a shadowy courtroom. The brutality is historical not gratuitous; life or death was decided here, men were hanged.

I enjoyed the Coen brothers version of True Grit better than the 1969 version starring John Wayne. It's hard to vote against the Duke or Robert Duvall in anything, let alone both icons in the same movie, but I liked the 2010 version more for the following reasons:

1. Follows the language and the setting of the book more closely. This is a good thing because the book is excellent.

2. Overall, better acting. LaBoeuf is played by an actual actor, Matt Damon. Nothing against Kim Darby, but Hailee Steinfeld pulls it off better. Maybe it was better direction or editing, or maybe she's just cuter, or maybe all of the above, but she was a little bit more believable than Kim Darby was. With Kim Darby one has the sense of watching a Disney film. I half expected her to start dancing or singing. it could be argued that Jeff Bridges is a less subtle in his portrayal of Marshall Cogburn, but I found the overall effect to be more entertaining.

3. Better cinematography

I have never seen a 14 year old actress carry her role like that.  powerful, believable - an incredible performance from start to end.  How she didn't take home an Oscar for her performance i will never know.  I think we can say the Oscars are now rigged!  This young lady is going to be around a while.

True Grit is a really good movie on its own. I enjoyed the quality of acting and production. Can't remember the music at all. As a nod to its namesake, they should have started it out with Glen Campbell singing 'True Grit' in the background like the original.

4201005,4,B003UESJME,"The original 1969 film (which garnered John Wayne an Oscar) is a cinematic icon, yet it's a tad sanitized and whitewashed.  The Coen brothers' 2010 version of TRUE GRIT is a rugged, gritty (pardon the pun), more realistic depiction of a 19th Century manhunt in the Indian Territories.  (And in this reviewer's opinion a much more enjoyable version than its predecessor.)  Viewers of the original film will instantly recognize much of the dialogue has been plugged into the Coen brothers' remake, and it's grand fun to hear Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon, and Hailee Steinfeld repeat several juicy lines first uttered by Wayne, Glen Campbell, and Kim Darby.  Thus the modern version pays affectionate homage to the original.

We're all familiar with the story:  Young, determined Mattie Ross hires Marshall Rooster Cogburn--a man known to have ""true grit""--to leave Fort Smith and go into the Indian Nations to capture outlaw Tom Chaney and bring him to justice for the murder of her father.  They are joined by a Texas Ranger named LaBoeuf, and over the course of their search they cross paths with Chaney and a band of outlaws riding under the direction of Lucky Ned Pepper.  Mattie does see Chaney meet his maker, yet during this encounter she falls victim to a rattlesnake bite, forcing Rooster to ride a horse to death in order to save her life.  There's a decided twist from the original, in that the film ends with 38-year-old Mattie journeying to a Wild West Show in hopes of meeting (and thanking) Rooster, who is traveling with the show--yet unfortunately, Rooster has died only days before.

Bridges is stellar as ornery, hard-drinking Rooster, while Damon is light years better as LaBoeuf than wooden Glen Campbell.  In fact, Steinfeld, Bridges, and Damon all play well off one another, augmented by solid performances from Josh Brolin as Chaney and Barry Pepper as Lucky Ned.  There is violence and gore in this remake not for the faint of heart, but again, this version is grittier, more realistic, and meaner than its predecessor.  As a matter of fact, this Coen brothers' remake of TRUE GRIT stands alone on its merits as one very good Western.

This version - starring Jeff Bridges - is vastly inferior to the 1969 version even if - as remarked - it is truer to the novel (hey, sometimes a novel is simply not as good as its screenplay). The Bridge's version suffers from actors who are trying too hard not to repeat dialogue in the same manner as in the classic John Wayne version and, as a result, either mumble or fumble the film's most classic lines. The acting is stilted and some of the players are clearly miscast, such as Matt Damen as La Boeuf (amazingly even non-actor Glen Campbell gave a more credible performace in the eariler version).

4201082,5,B003UESJME,"I read the book, and this is far closer to the book than the John Wayne movie is. As others mention, the actors do a fine job. Especially  Hailee Steinfeld's take on Mattie Ross. While not 100% faithful to the book (the book Mattie was pluckier, while this Mattie displays a steely resolve more often than pluck), Hailee's Mattie was clearly the star of this show, driving things forward with a steely resolve yet still being believably (and sometimes dismayingly, when bad things happened to her) fourteen. Hailee's face has an expressiveness that brings the character to life as she reacts to the circumstances she encounters, whether it was dismay, determination, whatever, her face showed what Mattie was feeling, and it was *right* for what was happening. To tell you the truth, I found her performance to be more believable than the book, the book Mattie was way too perky for a kid in those kind of circumstances.

For those complaining about the ending, the book pretty much does a cut-away to that scene at the end too. Perhaps the Coens could have changed that, but I think they were thinking more along the lines of, ""well, the book is a classic, and we've never written a western before, so let's stick with what we know worked for the book."" And finally, for those complaining about a fourteen year old doing the things in this movie, realize that in Arkansas, it was usual for girls to be married by age 15 until recent times, and a girl her age would have been doing childcare, housework, gardening, or the book-keeping it appears in this case for several years by age fourteen. Childhood as we currently envision it, as a time of innocence, simply didn't exist in the 1800's. Children were expected to participate in the full economic and social life of the family from an early age, they were not protected or cosseted as today. Families were big back then because the labor provided by the children had economic value, not because they loved children.

I'd actually rate this movie about 4.5, because while it is very good, it is no Fargo. But then, not many movies are. What it is, is a very good movie that does a far better job than the John Wayne movie of bringing the book -- and the era -- to life. Not that it makes the John Wayne movie a bad movie. But it's a John Wayne movie, and this is a Mattie Ross movie. That's the difference.",1352073600,,2359,4.558962264150943

So much potential with this cast of actors but I got the sense early on that I was being shuffled forward in order to just get to the end.

4201144,4,B003UESJME,"The original True Grit is not one of my favorite John Wayne films. That being said finding out one of the Duke's films was to be remade had my blood boiling. Lazy-ass Hollywood film makers can't come up with something original have to STEAL from the classics! Well, after watching this version I have to say they have done a fine job. Well written, well acted. In the end much more of the story shines through then the orginal movie which was over-shadowed by the Duke. This time around the story and the how the characters respond to each other (the word play is awesome) is the shining star. Where the Duke could say a million possitive things with a short statement (burning daylight) Jeff does by doing rather then by saying. Yes this is a story, but it reflects the real world. Stopping at nothing to get the girl medical attention after being bitten by a snake (because that is what is really important) rather then giving a horse a ""break"" shows us what we have lost in the modern world. We cry when watching a video of a limping dog being mis-treated yet turn a blind eye to a man or woman who has found themselves on the street. Rooster shows us what is truely important. John Wayne would be proud of this remake because it shines as a story, it has great actors who do very well in their parts, yet none of them try to out-shine a well written story; no matter what age it was written in.",1347408000,2,1398,4.3396946564885495

I found it to be boring and lacking in any real emotional resonance. I felt nothing for any of the characters and got no real sense that they felt anything for each other. Initially, I liked Maddie's attitude but after a while I admit that it wore thin. She seemed all spark and little real emotion. Cogburn and LaBoeuf were comical to the point where I had trouble believing that they ever managed to survive in their chosen professions.
I forced myself to finish watching it. When it ended, I wondered why I felt that I had to finish it. I cannot even blame the slow pace for my dislike because I like slow paced movies. I loved the Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. Now that movie had a kind of resonance and beauty, like a poem or a photograph. But this isn't a review of that movie. Anyway, I'm not sure what other people got from this movie but I didn't get anything but a sense of flatness. The story could have been a good drama, if only the characters actually seemed to feel anything.

4201160,2,B003UESJME,"I had somewhat high hopes for this film.  After all, it was apparently up for some pretty big awards.  I'm not going to say it was a total let down, but it was pretty close.

It's easier to say what I like about the film rather than what I didn't.
(SPOILER ALERT)  I liked the ambush action scene, the near-end action scene and Rooster's ride.  That's about it.

To begin, whoever wrote this script clearly thinks very well of themselves.  There was so much unnecessary dialogue, the film from the beginning comes across as chatty, thus rendering the characters most of the time unconvincing.

Being a seasoned student of the C.War period and thereafter, there were numerous parts in the film that simply annoyed me as they seemed quite unauthentic.  I wonder if the Coen brothers bothered to have any credible historical consultants.  I think that would have helped the film.  Furthermore, certain phrases used throughout the film struck me as a sorry attempt at authentic lingo.

The best acting performance came from Matt Damon and the guy who played Barry Pepper.  I felt that the cast was bogged down by the script and direction and could have done a better job.

It annoyed me greatly that Jeff Bridges sounds like he has something in his mouth throughout the film, and later did Matt Damon, as well as Brolin.  While Jeff Bridges' may have been trying to come across as authentic with this form of speech, to a viewer, it only hindered his performance and frankly didn't add to his character's authenticity in my eyes.

I had high hopes for True Grit.  I enjoy reading about the old west and thought I would enjoy this.  Without the somewhat star-studded cast, this film never would have garnered the acclaim it did and yet still came across to me as a rather amateurish film project.

I'm interested to see the first True Grit to see how well that version fared.",1345248000,5,1870,4.646341463414634

4201164,4,B003UESJME,"Okay, this isn't a five star movie. The number of five star reviews... silly. Also silly are the copious one and two star short stories from the whiners. I had already seen this version of the film when I bought it. I read as many 1+2 star reviews as I could handle out of simple curiosity, perhaps entertainment. All I have to say is ""damn dude, don't watch it if it offends you so much."" Certainly don't buy it, right? This is a rebuttal to the nay-sayers.

This is a good movie, and John Wayne couldn't act. Let's face it, The Duke played a puffed-up version of himself in every movie he ever graced with his presence. I'm glad you all loved him, but, the book never mentions John Wayne anywhere. The original flick was no more correct, either.

Deviations from he book? The addition of a few character twists and interesting moments is referred to as artistic license, which goes way back to Homer, Plato, the Old Testament, and beyond. The point of literature is to use your imagination(not the Duke) to fill in the colors, textures, and gaps in the story. Besides, would you have wanted to watch the same exact movie only with different actors?

I liked Bridges' character. What the other reviewers failed to define, is that you aren't supposed to bond emotionally with him. HE""S A BAD MAN! YOU AREN'T SUPPOSED TO FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM! An ill-reputed person on the frontier would have been a drunk, a crappy father, and a selfish SOB. He would have been poor at social situations due to a lack of civilized human contact. His english... well, he could have talked less like he'd been born in a cave(to a retarded grizzly), but it didn't anger me personally or cause me not to understand him at any point. Furthermore, frontiersmen at the time were widely known for their garbled, unique speech patterns.

The verdict: If you love the Duke and Dirty Harry, just don't watch it. Amazon carries both Unforgiven and the original '69 True Grit for you viewing pleasure. If you think old westerns leave a lot to be desired, watch it, perhaps this is the reprieve you've been waiting for.",1342828800,,2088,4.574866310160428
4201185,5,B003UESJME,"The Coen brothers have produced a masterpiece in my estimation. Great casting, with all of the actors/actresses in their respective parts. They hit all the right notes. The length of the piece is perfect, not too long, but like a good painting when the painter knows when to simply put the brushes down and walk away, they say what they want to say and don't overstate the thing or bore with too many details. Yet the details are there, in the careful choice of costume and environment accurately depicted, especially in the recreation of Fort Smith, the old currency (as in the scene when Mattie [Hailee Steinfeld] bargains relentlessly with the horse trader), the sense of the older manner of speaking (such as when Lucky Ned asks Marshall Cogburn, ""Well Rooster, will you give us the road?"" and later again asks him  ""...you think four on one is a dog fall?""), and, of course the many great outdoor locations in which it was filmed, and all of the guns & saddlery, etc. The music and soundtrack are simply perfect. I've watched it quite a few times and I haven't yet become tired of it.

I was pretty young when the original John Wayne and Glen Campbell version made its debut, yet I remember I truly enjoyed it, though I have not gone back and revisited it, nor do I think the two need to be compared. While the ""Duke"" stands out in high relief as one of my all time heroes of the big screen, Jeff Bridges turns in an equally impressive performance. He comes across as a very believable ""Rooster Cogburn."" Also there are just some advantages of modern film making that were not as well developed at that time, which renders trying to make a comparison of the two, in my perspective, somewhat futile, like comparing apples and oranges. Hailee Steinfeld was truly magnificent as Mattie, as were ALL the rest of the cast. Barry Pepper turns in an excellent performance of ""Lucky Ned Pepper,"" In which you can see even in his villain, a glimpse of the good side of the tarnished character as is also the case with ""Tom Chaney."" I salute the Coen Brothers! My hat is off to you. Beautifully done!

4201186,3,B003UESJME,"I was eager to see this film after reading many good reviews. I was somewhat disappointed. ""True Grit"" is better than most of the junk out there today, and it has a few memorable moments, but it's far from being a classic (and remember, it had the original film, and 40 years to learn from).

  The original ""True Grit"" (1969) with John Wayne was not a great film either, and Wayne won an oscar more as an appreciation of his life's work, than for his performance as Rooster Cogburn. That said, after seeing this version, I can appreciate the original more. That ""Grit"" may have been a lighter-weight confection, and over-long, but it was ""True"" to itself, and more pleasurable.
  This 2010 ""more-True"" Grit is certainly darker, but why do we assume darker, more violent, closer to the novel--makes a film, somehow, more worthy? The new version is also marred by its own cliches, such as a film score without a western feel, some dubious framing shots (dubious because they were lifted from John Ford westerns like ""The Searchers"" (: ), a 14 year old ""Mattie"" character with more legal smarts than Perry Mason (we got it in the first ten minutes, enough already), and a not quite right, mumbly performance from Jeff Bridges that never gets the humor/drama balance. It makes Wayne's broadly-played Rooster in the original, actally seem more assured.

  Even Glen Campbell and Kim Darby, both of whom I thought bland in the original, can now be remembered more fondly, as the original cast trio had a better chemistry. And the 2010 film also strains credulity, with its magically healing wounds, miraculous gun feats, and a melodramatic finale--right out of 1940's B-westerns. Com'on, if this version is meant to be darker and more realistic, it must be consistent.
What the film lacks is the old Hollywood craft that knits things together. (Henry Hathaway directed the 1969 True Grit.) And I for one, sure miss it.",1342224000,6,1913,4.810975609756097

This movie is not for those who are looking for a Tombstone like, shootout at the OK Coral, action packed western.  Its also not for those who are die hard John Wayne fans as I noticed that alot of the negative reviews are from folks who have put the original True Grit on a pedestal and any type of remake will fall short of the glorification of the first version.  Having said that, I admit to not having seen the original film or read the book from which this movie is based on.  I watched this film on its own merit, absent any prior knowledge, expectations or criticisms.  After watching it, its simply great filmmaking.  The actors and acting are all top notch.  The dialogue is smart, sharp and at times, witty.  The cinematography is well done.  The first time I watched the film, I did have some trouble catching what Jeff Bridges would say but during the second viewing I paid particular attention to the dialogue and alot of what I missed the first time, I caught the second time and like I said before, its worth figuring out because it's very clever, especially the back and forth verbal jabs between Jeff Bridges and Matt Damon.

When they are unexpectedly joined by a Texas Ranger, played by Matt Damon, who has been on the trail of the murderer for years things get even more complicated.

This remake of a John Wayne classic is quite good itself, and contrary to its previews and ad campaigns, is probably closer to a western-comedy hybrid than a drama or action movie within a western context.  Yes, I said comedy.  Most of the movie is spent on dialogue with only about 15 minutes of real action.  And it is the dialogue that provides the comedy.  Jeff Bridges plays a drunk whose slurred speech is filled with great one-liners while Matt Damon plays an over-talkative law officer, and their relationship throughout the movie alludes to that famous TV show The Odd Couple.  Josh Brolin is perfect as the villain, both in look, talk and style.  The lead actress, and the role around which the movie revolves is Hailee Steinfield.

4201227,5,B003UESJME,"This Coen Brothers Western is a wonderful film and superior to the older film starring John Wayne.

Although the earlier, Henry Hathaway film was definitely good, the Coen Brothers film is definitely better - in just about every way, if fact.  Acting, cinematography, script, and score are all clearly superior and fit in better, for example.

Importantly, though, the Coen Brothers' version has an artistry, atmosphere, and themes the original lacks.  It captures the lonely feel of the West uniquely well, has a darker, more human feel, and is more consistent - coming together into a tighter, more cohesive film that makes more sense.  It is more exciting and we feel more attached to the characters, and their relationships are more fleshed out.  The characters in the Hathaway version are strangely lively, which clashes with the story's ""grit"" theme.  There is a comic element, in fact.  The characters in the Coen Brothers' version are realistic and believable.  The are serious and have emotional depth.  Their lives are not easy, and they reflect their difficult experiences.  They have grit.

The climax in the Coen Brothers' version is much better, and the end is much more powerful.  The Hathaway version had a somewhat inconsistent script, while the Coen Brothers' version has a solid script.  Overall, the Coen Brothers' True Grit is a much more polished film.

The Coen Brothers claim it is another adaption of the book, but not a remake.  This claim is upheld by the strong differences in character, plot, and style between the two.  Also worth mentioning is that the Coen Brothers' version is more faithful to the book, which, in this case, results in a bolder story with more integrity.  It also provides their version with additional justification, as a reasonably accurate version of the story is now available on film.

4201229,5,B003UESJME,"The latest ""True Grit"" is a worthy film, possibly even a great one. But it's time for a closer assessment of the film as well as the common practice of movie remakes, which are popular with movie producers primarily because of a ""guaranteed"" box office draw.  In taking on the remake of ""True Grit"" the Coen Brothers might be expected to adhere, albeit it with creative flare, to the original story.  A radical make-over would seem especially ill-suited to this film for a number of reasons. Perhaps above all, its Dukish screen icon and ""Rhinestone Cowboy"" co-star, Glen Campbell, are sufficiently ensconced in public memory to make a barely recognizable ""True Grit"" seem disrespectful if not offensive.  Doing a remake of ""True Grit"" that is more a display of originality than a sincere adaptation would strike critics and public alike as intellectually and artistically dishonest.

At the same time, if the goal was faithful adherence to the original, there are far safer bets than the Coen Brothers.  The history of these filmmakers includes the off-beat black comedy ""Fargo"" and, more recently, ""That Is No Country for Old Men,"" a film closer to the existential, thought-provoking cinema of Ingmar Bergman than to conventional Hollywood entertainment.  Moreover, the original ""True Grit"" had certain elements that by today's standards might be considered sentimental, formulaic, or Disney-esque--i.e. ""dated,"" out-of-step with a new millennium along with its impatient and jaded consumers in a post-modern, digitalized mediascape.  Among today's directors the Coen Brothers, moreover, have established the expectation of making films that are ""off-beat,"" unconventional, utterly unique.  As a result, I was prepared for a wholesale remodeling, a barely recognizable approximation, of the original movie, which attained semi-classic stature primarily because it was Duke's last hurrah.

So what approach did the Coen Brothers take?  Remarkably, they elected NOT to play a clever, strikingly original hand with a test-proven, practically archetypal, property such as the one given them.  Viewers can pick up either of the two ""True Grits"" without fear of being misled into distortions of the literary source.  The viewer can just as readily watch both ""True Grits"" in succession and come out the wiser about the challenges facing the makers of remakes of popular films.

To begin with, it's critical to take note of how the Coens' script has pointed the viewer to the literary source, using the point of view (POV) of the daughter (Mattie), who is determined to avenge the killing of her father.  Moreover, the Coens have, to a degree considerably greater than the original, lifted  language directly from the literary source, even to the point of testing the credulity of a modern-day audience that is at once more deficient in language skills and ever more convinced that theirs is the exceptionally ""gifted child.""  Those who marvel at the scenery and score of the remake may forget too easily that the original version directed by Henry Hathaway was almost as mindful of its Western spaces (though neither version so completely captures the nature surrounding the quest for revenge as John Ford's ""The Searchers"") and of the importance of ""expanding"" the uncharted territory with a full-blown symphonic orchestration.  But the primary differences to story and plot, or to script, apart from the aforementioned are in a more graphic and shocking attention to detail, thanks to the use of more ""shock"" edits as well as a more dynamic, intrusive (at times jolting) sound-track.  The effect is to make the world of the hunted and the hunter as much a  part of the spectator's world as the wastelands of ""That Is No Country for Old Men"" or the frozen tundra of ""Fargo.""  There is no escaping the world of nature, however merciless, cold-blooded, and life-threatening it can be to all of us who, as mortal beings, necessarily share in its destiny.

Apart from the absence of John Wayne, the most obvious difference in characterization for many spectators is likely to be in the character of Mattie.  In the original version Kim Darby's Mattie is determined but at the same time a trifle awkward, or ""boyish,"" rather than precocious; she was a transplant from a Disney film about a tomboyish young girl intent upon showing her meddle.  In the remake Mattie is none of these things: rather, Halle Steinfeld's Mattie is a precocious, extraordinary articulate and intelligent 14-year-old feminist!  The question of her age and even gender are beside the point from the opening scene.  Her command of jurisprudence jargon and latin, her unhalting and complex verbal syntax, her keen intelligence and control of language are so complete and advanced as to tax the viewer's credulity (in fact, our suspension of disbelief is saved only by the reminder that that what we're witnessing is the account through the experienced perspective of the adult Mattie).

Matt Damon's LaBoeuf is quite obviously a more experienced screen actor than the role as played by country and western popular music star Glenn Campbell.  At the same time, Campbell's bumbling ways may seem more appropriate to the tenderfoot status that he occupies in the original film, in which he attains some redeeming maturity just prior to his death.  In the remake, Matt Damon's La Boeuf is able to provide a more capable and credible foil to Jeff Bridges' crustiness.  His strength might be seen as another device employed by the Coens to replace the original's most irreplaceable element, i.e., John Wayne.  For the same reason, the remake counterbalances Rooster Cogburn with a more formidable and believable antagonist.  Tom Chaney in the original is little more than a faceless, soon-forgotten villain, completely overwhelmed by the John Wayne protagonist that occupies our attention during and long after the movie.  The role as played by Josh Brolin's bad guy in the remake is one we take more seriously, especially given our familiarity with the actor in films like ""That Is No Country.""  The emphasis he receives is yet another answer to the overwhelming, indomitable presence of Wayne's Rooster Cogburn in the original.

The signature of a genuine auteur, as Andre Bazin and his followers argued, is not a film director who has complete control of his project along with the liberties of expressing himself as he chooses.  Alfred Hitchock was the most admired director of the influential French film theorists because he left his personal stamp on each of his films in spite of the commercial, profit-making priority expected of him in each instance.  There's a trademark tone, a consistency, a thematic purpose, or worldview, that becomes apparent in every Hitchcock film, even to a viewer who at the outset is unfamiliar with the director.

And here's where the Coen brothers have excelled.  Rather than taking a radically different, bold or quirky approach, they've stayed within the rules and, in spite of long odds, achieved a cinematic triumph that is consonant with the themes of their less formulaic films.  In the beginning of the film the stakes are made clear by the voiceover. As mortal beings we are accountable for our past actions, each of which will have consequences from which we can't hide.  In the end there is no concealing our offenses against society, nature or God; there is no escape or freedom; mortality in itself is at once inescapable, beautiful, and deadly.  Despite our wishes to the contrary, as Tommy Lee Jones' sheriff reminds us at the end of ""That Is No Country,"" there is no ultimate justice, no ""deus ex machine"" that will, at some climactic moment in our lives, rescue us from the final encounter against which, as Dylan Thomas reminds us, all mortals have no more than two options: 1. wearing blinders and cowering in fear; or 2. singing in our chains while raging against the dying of the light.

In the original ""True Grit,"" spectators had, prior to attending the film or shortly afterward, knowledge that the film was elegy as much as saga. Wayne's mythic character would not spare him from the cancer he was already fighting. It was in fact our knowledge of that ""human flaw"" that made the title ""True Grit"" stand not simply for the ""exceptional"" man but the ""universal"" one. Much as we hate to admit it, all of us in search of a dramatic rescue or, seeking escapist entertainment in movies, must confront the fact of our mortal existence. Better it be with eyes open and a healthy appreciation of life's bounties than the whimper of a cowardly lion. For some, there may be the consolations offered by religion, but neither the original story nor the Coen brothers' movie goes there. The church, to the extent that it is even visible in a Coen Brothers' movie, is presented as ineffectual, deluded and hypocritical.

In place of salvation lying outside the camera lens is an unflinching representation of the only life that the camera along with human consciousness can know. If it's not enough, it's more than most filmmakers have been able to offer. The Coen Brothers reveal what will be required of each of us at the conclusion of life's journey: the truest grit of all.",1332201600,2,9186,5.039630118890357

4201233,5,B003UESJME,"I gave this movie 5 stars, but would really rate it more like 4  stars.  However given a choice between 4 and 5 as my only two options I went with the higher rating.

The first version of True Grit was almost totally focused on John Wayne's role as he had to carry that movie for the most part.  There was no doubt that he was the one with True Grit.  The role of the Texas ranger was not very well acted by Glen Campbell, but several of the character actors were quite good.  I would give the original 4  stars also, just based on Wayne's performance and the performance of some of the character actors like the judge, and the outlaws.

In this second version Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) vies with Jeff Bridges for the person with True Grit.  She really steals the show much of the time with an outstanding performance.  Bridges interpretation of Rooster Cogburn was a little rougher and rawer than Wayne's, but Bridges does the role justice and with the aid of Hailee Steinfeld in the role of Mattie makes this a very good movie and just different enough to make it every bit as interesting as the original Wayne version.  Some of the character actors were not as interesting in this second version of True Grit.

4201234,1,B003UESJME,"I am not a fan of John Wayne by any means but there is no comparison between Jeff Bridges awful cartoonish performance as Cogburn with John Wayne's excellence in the role. The Coens really disappoint in this sloppily acted, sloppily edited film.
As a huge fan of the Western genre, I'm all for modern remakes of old stories, as well as original stories like Tombstone or Silverado.
This remake, though, does not capture the spirit of the book or the original film at all, and the pacing and story are really off. It's a film that can't decide if it is a drama or a comedy, and is inept at both. Bridges mumbles his way through the role of Cogburn and is virtually impossible to understand (I had to turn on the subtitles), Damon plays the character of Le Boeuf as a ridiculous martinet, and Brolin's villain (along with the other villains) are nicer than the ""good guys"" - sweet guys who happen to be unwashed bank robbers. They look like they ought to be having a picnic. Brolin plays his role as a cheap, hapless victim when in fact he is supposed to be a menacing, calculating sociopath (in the book and original film, played by a brilliant Bruce Dern). The only decent performances are the young girl who plays Mattie and the horse trader she bargains with.
I was particularly offended by a gratuitous scene in which Bridges character kicks a young native American, several times, for no reason, other than sitting on a porch. While it is true that racism was rampant at that time, the scene had no bearing on the story or action and was completely offensive.
Additionally, though this film was made on location in central Texas, there is an enormous amount of poor quality CGI enhancement, and uneven recoloring to give it a washed out sepia tone in some scenes but not in others.
Don't waste your time or money on this one. Buy the original.",1329955200,12,1847,4.54954954954955
4201265,4,B003UESJME,"I have not read any of the other reviews, so I'm probably walking much of the same ground.  But here goes.

The new film version of Charles Portis' novel will invariably be compared to the original movie, but it shouldn't be.  Both are adaptations from the same source as interpreted by different film makers of different eras.  The original sought authenticity, yet still depended on John Wayne star charisma and suffered from ""clean cut"" Hollywood imagery.

This version has more authentic frontier grit'n'grime.  Of course the locations are not right for Eastern Oklahoma, the Indian Territory of the novel: cinematographers are usually not geographers, and here they were obviously after a ""Western"" look of rugged canyons and bare, flat-baked prairies for good shots, not location authenticity.

The dialogue retains Portis' period-piece Victorian book-prose, though its elocution falls rather clunky from the lips of its 21st century actors, for whom it is an  unnatural form of speech. . . Nor did the average person of the period speak that way in real life.  One of the defects of transferring the word imagery of print to modern action drama.

Also this version is more ""evangelical"" than the original film or the book.  There's even a gratuitous Dolly Parton version of ""Leaning on the Arms"" at the closing scene.  The producers had a clear focus on the film's target audience. Though his central character Mattie is of this mold, Portis did not write his novel as a judgemental reap-what-you-sow gospel tract.

As good as the original, because it's based on the same story, which remains a classic in itself.  I don't believe one could make a bad version.",1329868800,,1667,5.014545454545455

While Wayne's movie followed the book and used much of the dialogue from it, the new version does a better job of telling the story as presented in the book and conveying the story's true spirit. Gone is the humor of the original designed to lighten the darkness of the story. Mattie is the storyteller in the book and she is the main character in the new movie instead of Rooster Cogburn. Bridges' portrayal of Cogburn emphasizes the lawman's cynicism and hardness. Mattie is hard as nails and sees the world in black and white, while Cogburn sees shades of grey, often tending toward the darker shades.

Although overall, it falls a little short of the original with John Wayne, it is a very good movie. Jeff Bridges' Rooster Cogburn is very good. Not as good as the Duke, but very well played none the less. All the other characters gave fine performances. I have to say though, that I thought Matt Damon's performance as the Texas Ranger was not nearly as good as Glen Campbell. The biggest surprise was the outstanding performance of little Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie. She litterly stole the show and upstaged everyone. Kim Darby was good in the original, but since Steinfeld was much younger and gave such a powerful performance she came off much more believable. The cinematography was much better. The most griping and most powerful scenes in the movie, with excellent camera work, is when Rooster rushes Mattie back for a Doctor on Mattie's horse. Great movie.",1329264000,,987,4.777777777777778

4201271,1,B003UESJME,"I'm going to try and keep this simple, as I could write paragraphs about how this was a horrible re-boot. It saddened me too, because I went into the film wanting to like it, based on the reviews.

The Acting - Nothing short of SAD. Jeff Bridges is a good actor, but NO ONE can ever replace John Wayne; especially in his Academy Award Winning role. The Duke brought so much emotion and heart to the Rooster Cogburn character, while Bridges just seemed like a pathetic boring drunk, playing a role for a paycheck. At no time did I feel any love or emotion towards Bridges as I did for Wayne. Kim Darby blew away Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie Ross. Clearly, Hailee looked the correct age, but couldn't hold a candle to Kim's perfomance of Mattie. I felt no simpathy for Hailee's character as I did Kim's. Kim brought so much raw emotion to Mattie, that after a while, you felt for the poor girl. Matt Damon's portrayal of LaBoeuf was another joke. He was so boring lifeless. Glenn Campbell brought humor and a certain arrogance to LaBouef. Josh Brolin as Tom Chaney...I'm stumbling over what to say. Another unemotional and boring character portrayal. Last but not least, Barry Pepper as Ned Pepper. He reminded me of Buford Tannon in Back to the Future III. Robert DuVall had a better look and didn't have to use a ""rough, raspy"" voice to make you believe he was a bad ass.

The Score - absolutely lifeless and dreary. The original score may have been a little ""cheesey"", but it brought a certain feel to the movie, that complimented the sequences in the film.

The Scenery - no where near as vibrant and alive as the original.

I would say my biggest gripe was the over-the-top phony ""cowboy"" dialect. In the original, everyone spoke in the REAL voice. Bridges, Brolin, Pepper and Damon all spoke in a ridiculous dialect. Many times you couldn't understand what Bridges was saying. It was so annoying.

I'll close with this: The 2010 version of True Grit is a disgraceful attempt at re-booting one of John Wayne's best performances ever. Everything about the re-boot was inferior to the 1969 Henry Hathawy film. It was clear that the Coen's wanted this to be a dark depressing movie, which is the exact opposite of the story and original film. The Duke is probably rolling over in his grave. I have friends that saw this movie and liked it. I then introduced them to the original, which looks abslutely amazing on Blu Ray, and they agree that the original is a much better film. Thankfully, this only cost me 3.99 on Black Friday. I honestly think this movie got all the hype it did, simply because the Coen's directed it. Don't know why so many people think they are amazing director's. They've had a few good films, and this wasn't one of them.",1327881600,13,2743,4.567073170731708
4201272,5,B003UESJME,"Now here is a true rarity, a remake that not only is as good as the original, it leaves the original in the dust.  Finally, the Coen brothers justify their reputation as great filmmakers.  I have been hoping in vain for the last 15 years for the Coens to make a movie that is up to the standards of their first, and best film, Blood Simple.  I must admit, I was scepticle at first.  First, I did not really like the original.  John Wayne was fine, as usual.  By this point, John Wayne could pretty much phone in the role he was playing, but John was never really a great actor to be frank.  But he WAS an icon, and that iconography shows through in the original.  But the near fatal flaw of the entire film was Kim Darby, the woman who played Mattie.  First, she didn't look like she was 14 (she was 21), and quite frankly, she was the most annoying human being on the planet.  Her incessant blubbering did not come across as determined, but more like whining.  This is probably the fault of the director, because he should have helped her with that performance.  This kills the film for me.  The film is also very much an old Hollywood version of the West, which is a tad idealized.  John Wayne's later westerns were a little grittier, but outside of Big Jake, they tended to be PG versions of what the West was really like.

Then I saw the Coen Brothers' True Grit.

Jeff Bridges is great as Rooster Cogburn, channeling his drunken, crazy sot in Crazy Heart and combining it with the Duke, and you get a great mishmash of a wonderful new character.  But Hailee Steinfeld, who plays Mattie in this version, is a vision.  Her portrayal was fantastic, and DOES come across as a tough girl in a very tough world who is determined to get justice for her father.  She is focused like a laser and very direct, and for some reason, pulls it off beautifully.  Matt Damon's LeBeouf is also great, being a bit of a dandy, but still, a very dangerous individual.  The world rings true, with the new revisionist wave of westerns that make them much more realistic.  Not exactly sure why Brolin gets top billing over Steinfeld, as he is in the movie for all of ten minutes, but he is good, too.  Even Barry Pepper is great, and who would have thought he could pull off fuzzy chaps?  I think the last time fuzzy chaps appeared in a western was Tom Mix.  Anyway, this is a great film.  The Coen's have finally made a great film worthy of their considerable talents.",1327536000,,2451,4.355408388520972
4201273,5,B003UESJME,"True Grit is a literary classic that has long been overshadowed by the John Wayne movie of the same name. The Coen brothers made a movie that was true to the wonderful novel by Charles Portis, which is recommended reading.

I viewed this with low expectations and was very, very pleasantly surprised. The Coen brothers reigned in their propensity for over the top gore and violence and told the story that Charles Portis told, including the sometime priggishness of Matty and the drunkenness of Rooster Cogborn and the cockiness of Le Beouf. Every character and story element came together just the way it should have. All of the leads are marvelous and I didn't even recognize Matt Damon, which was a good thing. The 1969 version gives us John Wayne as John Wayne, a towering presence, but not Rooster Cogburn. Jeff Bridges gives us Rooster Cogburn.

Along the way the Coens give us a portrait of a post-civil war America that is uncomfortably true. The West really was wild and was settled by a variety of people with true grit, not all of that grit suitable for Sunday school, though Matty's strong religious tendencies and quotations are the only element from the book that were downplayed.

A wonderful film from a wonderful story. Appropriate for children over eight. Use this movie as an entry to the wonderful novel, both could be seen and read as a family project.",1327363200,,1373,4.760504201680672

This is a wonderfully done film with marvelous acting, tremendous raw punch and a thread that ties together the prices that must be paid in life.  It's also visually beautiful, with subtle music that makes a difference.  The ending is very bittersweet in a poignant way that is lacking in the earlier version.

Comparisons with the book and the previous version of the film are inevitable, but this film easily eclipses the prior film featuring John Wayne largely due to the fantastic ensemble case, taut script writing and directing, and some of the best cinematography, art direction, and costuming in recent films.  ""True Grit"" captures the essence of the era, a much harder, rougher, and more violent time in the West.  This version focuses the action on young Mattie Ross who narrates the film and propels it onwards in her quest for justice.  Unlike the 1968 version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/True-Grit-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B000O179FY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">True Grit (Special Collector's Edition)</a>, which was more of a vehicle for Wayne, the course language and violence is largely retained from Portis' novel, and it is that stunning vernacular prose that is captured pitch-perfect here.  There is a poignant beauty to some of the dialog that at times is almost Shakespearian as is Mattie's single-minded commitment to seeing justice be done.  In the hands of a less capable actress Mattie Ross could come across as headstrong, cloying, obnoxious, or worse.  Yet the breakout debut performance by Hailee Steinfeld carries with it a sense of tentativeness and vulnerability the role requires.  Going with an unknown was an enormous gamble but it pays off brilliantly here.  Bridges is likewise pitch perfect as Rooster Cogburn, the cantankerous lawman Mattie goads into pursuing her father's killer.  Bridges plays the part with gusto, never veering into caricature and honestly I've never seen him better than this Oscar-worthy bravura performance.  Matt Damon's turn as the blustery Texas Ranger Le Beouf is particularly well tailored and the interplay between Ross, Cogburn, and Le Beouf as they track down Tom Chaney and his cohorts is hilarious - truly capturing the wit and humor from Portis' book.

The Coens also aren't afraid of quiet interludes throughout the movie, rather than creating a frenetic non-stop action movie approach that gives the movie time to breathe without losing any sense of suspense.  Those who have read the book or who have seen the prior film largely know how it unfolds.  Without spoiling the end, the final third of the movie where Mattie is caught by Tom Chaney and his gang's memorable dnouement is absolutely spellbinding.  Cogburn's efforts to save Mattie are profoundly moving, a testament to selflessness in the face of danger, and by the end I was bawling like a child.  In a time where movies are disposable flotsam in pop culture ""True Grit"" transcends completely, becoming art rather than being arty.  ""True Grit"" is an emotional roller coaster ride where you can certainly see aspects of yourself in many of the characters.  None of them wants to be where they are, yet all have a need and a desire to complete what must be done - the definition of true grit.  Every aspect of the movie is so well done and executed with skill and devotion that I could watch it over and over again.  I rarely see a movie a second time in theaters, but was moved by ""True Grit"" that I jumped at the chance to see it again.  Each viewing reveals still more detail you may have missed before and revel in the beauty of the script and the performances.  Even if you're not a fan of Westerns there's plenty here to enjoy, and ""True Grit"" is really more a tale of morality and selfless devotion to your fellow man; a movie that while sad at the end is nonetheless life affirming and inspirational.",1326931200,,3931,5.266025641025641

4201292,3,B003UESJME,"The Coen Brothers have made it clear that they are not remaking the classic Wayne film and are trying to stay more true to the book.  Other than the ending, that could not be anymore false.  Watching the two films, it is very clear that the Coen brothers have watched the John Wayne film over and over again.

All you have to do is look at particular scenes side-by-side.  So many of the same camera angles are used.  The spacial conformations of the characters are all too frequently close to the same.  The final fight between Cogburn and and Ned Pepper and his flunkies could basically be laid right on top of each other in dialogue and camera angles.  There are many many scenes in the Coen film that can basically be laid right on top of the Wayne film camera angles.  It is clearly inspired by the Wayne classic and it is far more likened to a remake rather than the claim that the novel was the big inspiration.  You may say they were more true to the ending, which is true, but there were other inserted scenes by the Coen brothers that are not in the novel.

Another thing to make very clear is that the novel never states that Cogburn wore an eyepatch.  So you're really telling me they wanted to stay more true to the novel rather than the Wayne classic?  This thing screams Wayne inspiration all over it.

So that aside, what about the film itself separated from the silly claim that they were inspired by the novel more than the Wayne film?  The actors are pretty good.  Bridges is really fun, except for hardly being able to understand him.  It is really hard to stomach his ""fill your hand you sonuvab*tch"" I didn't like it all the much.  No comparison to Wayne, it felt way too out of character and forced.

If you have seen the original film starring John Wayne, you have already no doubt seen all the clearly inspired camera angles and spaces.

Hailee Steinfeld is a marvel at Mattie. She handles the very affected dialog with an amazing skill, and is really good in a very physical role. (I read a Jeff Bridges' interview where he stated his original concerns about a new-comer holding her own in a major role of this type. He apparently got past it.)

4201319,5,B003UESJME,"I have never read the book and I had not seen the original film. Admittedly, I went into this movie biased as a big-time Coen Brothers fan but I cannot believe anyone can watch this movie and not consider it a Top 10 Western or Top 5 Western. This re-imagining of the original only furthers my fanship and evinces to me what masterful filmmakers the Coens are. The dialogue, as with almost all of their work, is masterful. The court scene alone is worth watching repeatedly. The score for the movie, with various renditions of ""Leaning on the Everlasting Arms,"" sets the mood of the film beautifully. I have gone back and watched the original and it is painful. It's not as gritty (pun intended) and captivating and John Wayne couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. Meanwhile, Jeff Bridges' performance as Rooster should have garnered him a slew of awards. It ranks right up there with Unforgiven, Pale Rider and The Outlaw Josey Wales among others as one of the all time greats.

4201322,4,B003UESJME,"By and large, I thought ""True Grit"" was a decent Western and I think I give kudos to Jeff Bridges for playing a credible Rooster Cogburn.  I don't think Bridges just imitated the Duke's Oscar winning performance but created his own character.  Matt Damon also did a good job as the Texas Ranger who joins Mattie and Rooster on their quest to bring Tom Chaney to justice.

One other thing I particularly liked was the ornate dialogue that really gave you a sense that you were watching real people and not just actors going through the motions.

I do have a few complaints:

1.  Occasionally, both Bridges and Josh Brolin (who played Chaney) sound a bit like they are auditioning for the role of the old prospector in ""Blazing Saddles"" (the one who spoke ""authentic frontier gibberish"").

<spoilers>

2.  The climactic moment was abrupt.  I almost felt like the film makers felt they had to end all the drama in the space of about three minutes or they'd lose the audience.

3.  The whole ""25 years later"" epilogue was totally unnecessary.  For the life of me, I can't fathom why they didn't just fade out after Rooster saved Mattie's life.  Seeing that she became a dour looking, one armed spinster (who reminded me of the ghost in the ""Woman in Black"") and that she never got to say goodbye to Rooster was a downer.

Bottom line:  This was a good Western with good actors and high production values, and I'd be interested in seeing Bridges do the sequel that John Wayne did with the same character called ""Rooster Cogburn.""

4201325,4,B003UESJME,"When I first heard they were remaking True Grit, I was shocked.  Why remake the wonderful film for which the Duke won his only Oscar?  I did not have any great desire to see it in the movies and finally caught up with it tonight on blu-ray.  My opinion remains the same, it is an excellent film but what was the rationale for remaking it?  Jeff Bridges seems to be making a new career out of playing rather scruffy, hard-drinking characters.  He is excellent as Rooster, however the Duke's performance was legendary.  Hailee Steinfeld is also wonderful as Mattie Ross, but Kim Darby was terrific as well.  Glen Campbell is usually criticised as LaBoeuf, however he was okay in his second film.  I must admit to not liking Matt Damon very much, however he is okay in the role.  Josh Brolin has little more than a cameo as the evil Tom Chaney.  This film has some fine supporting actors, however the original had Robert Duvall, Dennis Hopper, Strother Martin, Jeremy Slate, Jeff Corey, etc.: all very fine actors.  Like the original this film has beautiful scenery, wonderful cinematography and is an all-around enjoyable experience. The ending was fairly downbeat, closer to the novel I understand, than the Wayne version that made one walk out of the theater with a smile.  I guess the only rationale for remaking it is that the Coen brothers wanted to do it and Jeff Bridges was hot as hell after winning his Oscar.  I enjoyed this film, however it will never replace the Wayne version for me.
The picture and sound on the blu-ray are great.  There are numerous special features, however no deleted scenes.  There is a discussion with the cast wherein they rave about each other.

I thought Jeff Bridges was very strong in his role as Rooster Cogburn.  Like some of the other reviews have said, he was a little hard to understand at times, so crank up the volume and turn on the subtitles.  Matt Damon was great in his role as LaBoeuf, as well.  He played the egotistical lawman perfectly.  His interchanges with Jeff Bridges were awesome.

Here's what took the one star away from this movie (spoiler alert):  I found the premiss of this movie to be completely too far fetched to be realistic.  Mattie Ross (played by Hailee Steinfeld, who did a great job) would never have been taken seriously as the spokesperson for her dead father's estate.  Especially when she was negotiating for her father's money back on the horses.  Or, when she tagged along with Rooster.  He would have never let her go, nor would a young lady from that time period gone out into the wild west wilderness like that.

Its most definatly not just a great western but a great movie, but i have seen the original and... (keep in mind ive never read the book before i am comparing it to the original movie with john wayne)

DOWNSIDE okay i went into this after the trailer thinking its gonna be like true grit. in the preview the words and actions were the same so i thought it was gonna be true grit but a bit ""grittier"" because of the market nowdays.  The cohen brothers attempted to play God with this one. Did someone die in the orginal and you didn't like it, well, Lets let em live! Someone not die the way we liked em to, hm, lets change it! Someone not die and we think they shoulda,hm, lets kill em!
 Not to mention the fact that they cut the entire beginning of the movie off. You never even see her papa alive, the film opens with his dead body laying in the snow (where in the old one it begins with her handleing her fathers finances in the remake it skips all that and a bit later on she says ""mother never had a way with figures and could hardly spell cat""

though i love it when she says he probly thought hed gotten away free but ""the only thing free is the grace of god"".

UPSIDE  Why am i giving this four stars? because from someone who never saw the original this movie would be a masterpiece. The acting was amazing. This little girl is downright beautiful and her portrayal of mattie is as well. She brings something the same yet totally different to the table. I would love to see this kid in something else. Jeff Bridges was awesome but i just couldn't quite nail where id heard that accent before, somewhere between Sling Blade, Blades whistler and Jeff Bridges but he brought something totally different than the Rooster that we knew from the original True Grit.  Matt Damon was great but his acting style was quite similiar to the orginal LaBeaf as was the guy who played Tom Chaney though he looked totally different of course yet LaBeaf looked the same about.",1322006400,,2121,4.298245614035087

Jeff Bridges is also excellent in this film, and brings a realness to his character.

On the positive side, the girl is less annoying and less wooden than the original and the men tried do a good job with their roles.

4201387,5,B003UESJME,"This review of ""True Grit"", the movie, is from the viewpoint of one who read Charles Portis's 1968 masterpiece before ever seeing either of the film adaptations.  The book is a quick read, and a delight, from the beginning of Mattie's recollection to the very last sentence that wraps up her stormy and touching ""relationship"" with the tough, one-eyed Rooster Cogburn. Each film - 1969's John Wayne vehicle and 2010's Hailee Steinfeld debut - should be discussed in its relationship to the book it was adapted from. Comparing the films to each other is inevitable, but unproductive in the long run.  Each stands alone, unique to its own era - 1969 and 2010 being worlds apart in preconceived notions of the ""Old West"", and movie viewing in general.

Having read the book, and having watched both movies in opposite order (I saw TG 2010 before I saw TG 1969), I must say that the Coen brothers brought the book to life in ways unheard of in 1969. The earlier version was a fine adaptation for that period of American life.  It was clean, it was sweet in many ways, but it lacked ""grit"".  And ""grit"" is just what the Coens brought to the table in their version. Yes, Rooster Cogburn was a mumbler, he was dirty and trigger happy, his hair was unclean and uncombed. Remember, he lived in the saddle, and home was an ill-equipped back room in a general store. LaBeouf, a Texas Ranger, who was into his fourth month of travel on the trail of Tom Chaney, the same wicked man who killed Mattie's father, was a little more couth, a trait that Mattie made clear in her telling - Portis separated him from the ilk of Cogburn and the outlaws because Mattie was more than a little, albeit reluctantly, smitten with him.  Chaney and his gang were even dirtier and more unkempt than Cogburn, and why wouldn't they be? It was the late 1800's, and bathing was only a once or twice a month ritual even for those who lived in houses, so one can imagine the filth and vermin that would plague those who lived ""on the lam"", hiding out in caves and lean-tos, evading the law at every turn.

Some who gave unfavorable reviews had trouble with the vernacular and, in particular, Mattie's stilted language and Cogburn's often incoherent rantings. Mattie was fourteen years old, and obviously very well-educated. Such education in those days had to be from extensive reading - there was little contact with the world outside of Yell County Arkansas, so text books, the Bible, and literature were her teachers, and therefore her language would emulate those whose words she read. As for Rooster, he was a drunkard, and his education was limited. Jeff Bridges was brilliant in his portrayal of such a character. Both actors brought Portis's characters to life brilliantly.

The musical score was solely adapted from old Christian hymns, primarily vocal and instrumental versions of ""Leaning on the Everlasting Arms"". Using existing music made Carter Burwell ineligible for awards on his beautiful and haunting score, but it suited the staunchly Presbyterian Mattie to a ""T"", and the musical accompaniment to Rooster's exhausting ride for Mattie's life was breathtaking - ""Leaning on the Everlasting Arms"" indeed!

I can't say enough about this movie.  I loved it, and have watched it several times. The book has found its place among my favorites of all time, and though I have read it twice now in less than a year, I can see myself re-reading it. Films from well-loved books are often disappointing and shallow - not this one.",1317859200,4,3501,4.752883031301483

The filmmakers didn't stray too far from the original but were still able to inject some new and interesting things into the film that the original didn't have. Still, the original is much better.

Now, for the bad stuff: Jeff Bridges was very hard to understand. I understand that it was part of his character but it just made it very frustrating. It's not entertaining having to rewind and try to figure out what he was saying . Use subtitles while watching this and I guess you'll be OK. His mumbling was atrocious.

4201416,5,B003UESJME,"Nobody stood taller in the saddle than John Wayne and Clint Eastwood in the western genre, and here is a remake for which ""the duke"" received his only Oscar after well over 100 films... the Coen brothers were real careful not to copy the original word for word, scene for scene, surprisingly adding and acheiving their own originality to the film. Jeff Bridges is convincing as Rooster Cogburn, returning to the genre after giving a memorable performance as Wild Bill Hickok... in the beginning of ""Grit"" Bridges awkwardly stumbles and crumbles some of the lines but retaliates for most of the film. Hailee Steinfeld is the determined Mattie Ross showing great promise in the motion picture field. Matt Damon is the dandy Texas Ranger, Barry Pepper is the fiery Ned Pepper, and Josh Brolin is the fugitive Tom Chaney... for those of you who were skeptical, including myself, about even touching a John Wayne classic like True Grit, take the approach of watching a brand new movie, this one should satisfy most western followers, the Coen brothers did a good job of adding new characters and projecting the realism of the old west... the five star rating is for true originality.",1315958400,,1178,4.865671641791045
4201417,4,B003UESJME,"Ok to keep it short I very much enjoyed this new version of my favorite JW classic.  Each movie has its good and bad in equal amounts.  Having watched the original many times I wanted to see this remake with as much of an open mind as possable. I have not read the book so I make no comparison's to that work.

  I have to agree with the assesment that the original was a John Wayne playing John Wayne.  This new version was a darker version of the Cogburn charector. Bridges did a excellant job with his version. Waynes version made him seem a lovable alcohic while Bridges version made him more close to a realistic portrayal of a true alcoholic.( I am a recovering alcoholic hence the focus here.) I found both to be enjoyable based on the time each movie was made and the different audiance of today vs 1969 which is when I 1st saw the original. The weight of each version carries both movies well. Wayne lighter Bridges darker.

Having just watched both versions back to back there is one point that I found that sets one movie slightly above the other. This would be the classic confrontation between Cogburn and Pepper.  I found the Wayne version of that scene to be more exciting and satisfying than the remake.  This is due to one simple prop. There was just something more captivating about John Wayne at that epic moment saying fill your hand you SOB while drawing his pistol and flipping the lever action of his winchester one handed that made the scene more riveting than JB and his 2 pistols. Hollywood hoopla maybe but what a scene. I felt it on a emotional level in the original, not so much in the remake.  Both versions are good I just enjoyed JW a little more. Nostolgia perhaps but one prop can chaNGE THE DRAMATIC IMPACT OF A CLIMATIC CLASSIC SCENE (opps caps lock and lazy lol).

  Well so much for keeping it short but I find both versions to be fine film making of a classic story.  Just enjoy; both are worthy. Just a point of veiw from a dime a dozen movie fan.",1315785600,,1987,4.364130434782608

Nothing happens!  The two or three action sequences are overshadowed by useless, incessant, rambling, pointless dialogue.  The movie begins with the young girl haggling over money with a random character for like 15 minutes, it is the most boring way to begin a movie.  Do movies these days even have editors?  The ""plot"" if you can call it that, is like every other western without an ounce of originality.  Jeff Bridges is so annoying, he's like the negative, loser, grumbling, complaining old guy in your family that you can't stand being forced to talk to.  Even when they get ""on the trail"" to pursue the murderer, every scene just shows them on their horses listening to Bridges mumble.  He's an awful actor, I mean, it takes no skill at all to mumble like a drunk.  His character is identical to his last film where he played a loser drunk.  Damon is a bit more interesting, but you can see his character's moves coming from a mile away.

I always thought that Darby's performance was the weakest component of the ensemble in the original.  Newcomer Hailee Steinfeld, by contrast, is as strong a player as Bridges and Damon.  Viewers need not be familiar with the original to appreciate the performances in this new version.  The music, by composer Carter Burwell, who also scored a new version of The Alamo (another Wayne classic), captures the essence of the period in a way that demonstrates his keen sense of style.

4201424,3,B003UESJME,"True Grit, 2010 film

Could a fourteen year old girl leave home to avenge her father's murder? A hired man killed his employer and fled away with no one in pursuit. [Believable?] This young girl came to collect her father's body. She sees three men hanged. The Sheriff explains why he can't pursue Tom Cheney into Indian Territory. She will need a US Marshal, like Rooster Cogburn. [Usually the unclaimed bodies of outlaws were sold for medical purposes.] Miss Ross does not wear a hat or bonnet, false history of that era. She is also a sharp bargainer1 [Unbelievable.] Maddie gets her father's old pistol. Marshal Cogburn brings them in dead or alive. Maddie offers him $50 to get Tom Cheney (in addition to the usual price). LeBoeuf turns up to visit Maddie; he is a Texas Ranger who is also after Tom Cheney. Maddie buys a horse then hires Cogburn and prepares for the hunt. Reuben Cogburn has left without her! Maddie won't be stopped by a river.

They talk over a campfire. Maddie learns of a deal, but it is nullified by an argument. Cogburn learns about Cheney. They find a body. Then another man rides by with a body on a horse. They find shelter in a dugout cabin, and get news about Cheney. Cogburn has a plan. LeBoeuf arrives, then four others. ""That didn't pan out."" They continue to ride, the ground is snow-covered. They camp and talk. There is another disagreement. Down at the stream Maddie sees Cheney and is captured by Ned. But LeBoeuf shows up in time! Cogburn rides against four men with his two revolvers. LeBoeuf shows his sharpshooting skills. Maddie knows how to shoot too. There is more drama from snakes. Cogburn knows how to treat snakebite and rides with Maddie for help. Twenty-five years later we hear the rest of the story. Maddie visits a ""Wild West Show"" where Cole Younger and Frank James perform (after their release from prison). She hears that Cogburn died, and has him re-buried in the family plot. And so it ends.

This ending seems unsatisfactory. I never read the original 1967 novel and don't remember the details of the original 1970 movie. This version was not a commercial success. It is unusual today to show a teenage girl so handy with a firearm. What was the purpose of recreating a 40-year old Western movie? A story of relentless revenge recalls ""The Searchers"". Some of the classic westerns of the 1930s did involve a story of revenge but as a side-plot. The idea of a fourteen year old as a hard bargainer is not believable. How many adults today even understand a ""writ of replevin""?",1314835200,,2539,4.637777777777778
4201435,5,B003UESJME,"I think the Coen Brothers True Grit is superb. I'm old enough to have seen the John Wayne version in the theaters when it was released, and since I wasn't unlucky enough to have been born with the ""Duke"" gene, I found it to the earlier True Grit to be OK at best. There was some good acting in the earlier version, but it wasn't exhibited in any of the 3 main characters. It wasn't a bad movie, but compared to the current version... well, there is no comparison. Original gets a ""C+"". Current version scores an A+. The only reason one could possibly think the original movie was better is out of nostalgia, and as Bob Dylan says, ""...nostalgia is death..."".",1314662400,,658,4.401639344262295
4201436,3,B003UESJME,"I came to this movie expecting quite a lot.  Look, it got all those nominations (tho didn't win one) and it's a Coen Bros. production.  Frankly, I came away disappointed.  The film is beautifully shot of course and the period setting is done with an eye for authenticity.  First, let me say, I thought Jeff Bridges was great as Rooster, although I had to use subtitles to understand what a word he uttered.  I also liked Damon, in a real departure from his usual characters, he had the unenviable task of having to show romantic feelings for an uh, 14 year old (even though in fairness she acted like a 40 year old).  Now comes the problem for me, the girl playing the lead.  First of all, from the beginning she speaks like a law clerk for the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, second, even when faced with people getting mutalated and a kid relatively her age getting his fingers chopped off and dying right in front of her, she is still quoting legalese and acting like a 30 year old vet after 3 tours in Nam', no post truamatic stress for this kid, oh no!  We really never see her truly frightened or shaken, look, here is a 14 year old, whose father has just been murdered and she's marching around like an petulent cyborg, with a Harvard Law Degree, with not ounce of fright or worry, and even when she's captured by some crazy rednecks, all she's worried about is what's for supper, and haranging them about the law, like she's auditioning for the lead in The Lincoln Lawyer, not worrying about being savagely assaulted, or worse, no, she worried about what kind of beans they're going to serve her!  Here she is a female child in the old west at the mercy of crazy male rednecks and she's sitting at the camp fire asking about the fish of the day!  Not to mention, I just didn't care for her period, she seemed like such a know it all, Pratt, who needed a real reality check.  I also wasn't crazy about the end, it seemed anti-climatic, and the actress who playes the adult lead, is severe to say the least.  Overall, I recommend this because it's a Coen film and for Jeff Bridges great turn as Rooster, as for the kid, I have no idea how she got a nomination for this, much less was an early favorite..as perplexing as her odd performance, she must have Harvey Weinstein as her agent.",1314576000,2,2295,4.386792452830188

4201438,2,B003UESJME,"I was so looking forward to this re-make that I dug out my old John Wayne version DVD and watched it
for the first time after seeing the film in the theatre during its first run.  I was pleasantly surprised that this original version remained a great entertaining western.  I watched the new version on DVD last night.  Supposedly the Coen brothers used more of the dialogues from the book but I found the lenghthy dialogue weighed down the dramatic tension of the film.  The worldliness of the 14 year old girl on film was hard for one to believe and the young actress didn't have the special quality to bridge that critical gap (maybe no one can).
Jeff Bridges' performance was disappointing (Coens partly to be blamed).  JB didn't seem to have the statue required to bring that Rooster Cogburn to life.  Matt Damon was given the difficult role of the Texas ranger.  As usual, MD made the best out of it.  Josh Brolin and Barry Pepper were not given much to chew on.  The  2 major set pieces were poorly executed.  The gunfight at the cabin in the original version was exciting and occured during a beautiful morning.  It was pitch black in this new version and unexciting and without tension.  The famous horse back charge at the climax is a great disappointment in comparison to the original version.  The epilogue seems unnecessary even if it might be based on the book.

4201441,5,B003UESJME,"Chalk me up as one who was puzzled at the idea of Joel and Ethan Coen ""stooping"" to do a remake of another movie - especially a semi-classic John Wayne Western.  A remake is already pedestrian - if they had remade something edgy like Orson Welles' ""Touch of Evil"" or Hitchcock's ""Notorious,"" I might not have been surprised, but a John Wayne film (other than perhaps ""The Searchers"")?  What is going on here?

I shouldn't have doubted these guys, who have added another gem to their filmography.  ""True Grit,"" it has been said, is less a remake than a reimagining, and I think that is fair.  This movie is both darker and more spiritual than the John Wayne version.  An opening shot of snow gently falling on a dead body lying in the street sets an elegiac tone that is maintained throughout - thanks in large part to the masterful score by Carter Burwell.  The movie both pays homage to the dangerous world of the Old West and, like ""Unforgiven,"" reminds us that many of the heroes of our history were nasty cusses just like the villains.

Hallie Steinfeld nearly steals the movie from everyone else with her performance as Mattie Ross, a fourteen year old girl who travels to the frontier to avenge her father's murder and put his affairs to right.  This is the most unnervingly perfect performance by a young lady since Natalie Portman's turn in ""Beautiful Girls.""  Mattie Ross may be fourteen, but she is often the smartest person in the room and always the most determined.  This is a gal who can stand up to murderers and thieves.

It's good that she can, because that's who she runs into.  Even the good guys - Marshall Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) and Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) - are not above lying or thrashing a child when it suits them.  Bridges and Damon make a good pair - Bridges plays Cogburn as a perpetually half-buzzed killer who's only on the side of the law because it pays regular, and Damon's LaBoeuf is only a Texas Ranger because it allows him to say he's a Texas Ranger.  Both men can kill and kill well.

The rest of the cast, including Josh Brolin as the murderous Tom Chaney and Barry Pepper as the ill-fated Lucky Ned Pepper, does fine work in their supporting roles.  Pepper in particular seems born to play a Western villain - he dirties up good.  It's only the limited screen time that keeps these guys in their roles as supporting players.

There's a lot of discussion these days about the Coen Brothers' filmography and where various movies rank on that list.  For what it's worth, my personal favorite is ""Miller's Crossing.""  But all those lists are ultimately irrelevant as the Coens consistently make first rate movies - it's fun to see that, with the exception of ""The Ladykillers,"" pretty much every one of their movies is somebody's ""favorite Coen Brothers' film.""  ""True Grit"" deserves to be at the top of several of those lists.",1313625600,4,2882,4.620825147347741
4201442,2,B003UESJME,"I bought this movie not knowing what to expect.  Since it was yet another remake by Hollywood, in a long line of remakes, I expected them to feel the need to change the movie from the orginal which they did.  I don't know if it's these changes or what, but this movie just doesn't flow well.  Jeff Bridges does a good job of acting and I like him, but his portrayal of Rooster Cogburn just doesn't flow.  It's too dis-jointed from when he jumps personalities between the drunk, the grissled tough sheriff, the braggart, etc. and I kept waiting for the directors to yell ""cut, do it over"".  Another part of the problem is they not only re-made a movie that didn't need re-made, but they stole lines from the 2nd version of this movie with John Wayne, in ""Rooster Cogburn (and the lady)"".  This particular scene was a terrible reproduction of the original scene of Rooster shooting the 'corn dodgers'.  Just out of nowhere they slap in their version of this scene and it didn't fit in the movie at all, almost as if it was an after thought to do this and they randomly picked a spot in the movie to do it.  And unfortunatley Matt Damon's portrayal of LeBoeuf was just down right annoying with the monotone steadiness of his voice.

Basically, if you've seen the original True Grit with John Wayne, this movie doesn't measure up.  If you haven't, then your mileage may vary.",1313539200,2,1371,4.491935483870968

The ending was truer to the book than the 1969 film, but some nonsensical plot twists like LaBoeuf splitting off and then accidently showing up at the cabin ambush scene made no sense, especially when he took a heavy rifle shot through the shoulder without much ill effect. Cogburn and Mattie finding a corpse hanging from a tree, cutting it down, and later encountering some weird mountain man character who wanted to sell the corpse back to them was just strange, as it was not in the book and the extraneous scenes added nothing to the film. Parts of the book shined through, but too inconsistently to carry the story along. The original film had a contrived Hollywood ending,(and a ghastly theme song sung by Glen Campbell) but many of scenes were pretty close to the original dialog in the book. The cabin scene with a young Dennis Hopper was quite memorable, and John Wayne and Glen Campbell played off each other very well. The Coen Brothers effort shined in spots, but was overall rather disappointing.

4201510,5,B003UESJME,"The original True Grit was a superb vehicle for John Wayne and it's centred on his persona. It has a lot of spirit and you suspect Wayne enjoyed making it and he rightly garnered an Oscar after a lifetime of making westerns. That film captured the beauty of the wide open landscape and really zipped along. The Coen brothers have taken the subject of the film from the original novel by Charles Portis,fleshed out the salty,idiomatic speech patterns, focused more on Mattie Ross's perspective. In addition, it was shot in settings more typical of the novel. (The 1969 film shot in the Colorado Rockies and the Sierra Nevada, while the 2010 film was shot in Santa Fe, New Mexico as well as Granger, and Austin, Texas.)

The novel's narrator is Mattie, which got totally lost in the original. She has the ""true grit""of the Old Testament and she finds it matched by Rooster Cogburn's more worldly,lethal ""true grit"".Mattie like a religious Huck Finn goes forth into a pit of hell full of blood and rattlesnakes to gain vengeance on the man,Tom Chaney, who killed and robbed her father. Mattie(Hailee Stenfield)losing her innocence has to pay a high price to pursue the wicked:""I would not rest easy until that cur was roasting and screaming in hell!""The film captures the novel's spirit-Cormac McCarthy with laughs. Mattie is an avenging fury. This will affect the rest of her life.

The Coens movie is stronger than Hathaway's by fully re-engaging the western,aided by the cinematography of Deakins,the historical accuracy,but also by its greater weirdness:Mattie cutting down a corpse,the pitilessness of the wider world outside Fort Smith,the post Civil War atmospherics,the silencing of the about-to-be-hanged Indian,the passing of the buffalo,the Indian relieving them of the corpse to trade with,the mountain medicine-man dressed in a bearskin,the madman in Pepper's gang with his maniacal gobbles and squawkings,Mattie sleeping in a coffin. We could be in The Outlaw Josie Wales in spirit.

Bridges Cogburn is meaner than Wayne's,but as heroic and his gruff hide-""I don't believe in fairytales or sermons or stories about money,baby sister"" and he seems to desert her- has a protective core. He threatens LaBoeuf when he whips Mattie. LaBoeuf ,the dandy Texas Ranger is far better served by Matt Damon than Glen Cambell. Brolin plays Chaney as an evil psychopath. The music has spirituals in it like `Leaning on the Everlasting Arms',which recalls Night of the Hunter,especially with the story's final desperate ride with its macabre,swooning fairytale elements of sweeping stars.

The flawed but ultimately virtuous male lead characters as also very compelling.  The great scenery and realistic feel to the time and setting almost a characters in themselves as well.

Kim Darby excellent; Hailee Steinfeld phenomenal.

Glen Campbell a good singer (cf. Ricky Nelson in ""Rio Bravo""); Matt Damon a natural.

Barry Pepper as good in his way as Ned Pepper [sic] as Robert Duvall, which is quite a compliment.

Josh Brolin conveys the sleaze of Chaney more effectively than Jeff Corey.

1969 Glorious Technicolor all the way; 2010 all earth tones, without a bright color in the entire film, either in costume or landscape.

1969 heroic, culminating in the closing freeze-frame of Rooster rearing his horse; 2010 elegiac, ending at Rooster's grave in an unsentimentally touching epilogue to the main plot.

The acting in this new version is superb, from 12-year-old Hailee Steinfeld playing 14-year-old ""Mattie Ross"" to Jeff Bridges playing the crotchety ""Rooster Cogburn."" Wayne would have been proud.

The cinematography was good and that's no surprise since the main cameraman was the famous Roger Deakins.  The Blu-Ray transfer looks magnificent.

To me, the best part of the film was the dialog and a few quirky characters. In that regard, it reminded me of another Coen Brothers film, ""No Country For Old Men."" The biggest difference between that film and this, however, is the amount of violence. Overall, this western was not very violent; it was mostly dialog-driven. That's okay, too, because the dialog is terrific throughout.

The Coens are typically sharp as a Bowie knife here, and the blu-ray shows their fabulous cinematographic sense to perfection. Bridges is good but the film belongs to Haylee Steinfeld, who is simply amazing as the young girl looking for justice. She makes this film and deserves some awards for her near-perfection here.

I love Westerns, and while this isn't right up there with the very best, it's certainly close. Lots of gorgeous panoramas, both physically and emotionally, and by the end I could really feel for some of these characters. That's good writing and good filmmaking. All in all, I liked it more than the original John Wayne film, in fact.

The Coens understand cinema on another level from most directors working today. They work tightly within whatever genre they choose but are never slaves to it, merely bright enough to use the best tropes and let the rest fade away. The result here, as usual, is a satisfying film that both looks and feels good.",1311552000,,979,4.781065088757397

4201531,2,B003UESJME,"poor intro to the story using a narrative and the ending was likewise a disappointment. I believe we have the director to blame for some of the failure in this movie such as having Jeff Bridges over do trying to sound gruff. In the middle of the movie where a little more of his natural voice was allowed, it was actually an improvement to the experience of the movie. The gal that plays Mattie had some bright spots with her expressions, but the haggling scene came up short in comparison to the original. I'm not a huge John Wayne fan, BUT when he did something right.....he flat did it extremely well and the same goes for Duvall and the rest of the cast of characters in the original. Matt Damon started out well but then was no better than Glenn Campbell and lacked in his performance.

I blame the director for the shortcomings in this movie. Sure Barry Pepper is a great actor, but he just didn't carry the role as well as Duvall. Josh Brolin was ok, but again kept from doing it as well as he could. It was obvious. It was as if all the actors were being held back from giving their best to follow the vision of the director who should stick to Sci-fi etc and forget about remaking a great classic western that was done so perfectly the first time around. I honestly don't know what the director was thinking. I live out west and the characters lacked the flavor, the spice and character of real life out here.
John Wayne's True Grit captured all of it.

My wife was also greatly disappointed in this film, so much so that she demanded I get the original along with Rooster Cogburn in case some fool decided to do a remake and screw that up as well.

You expect more, you expect better, not in special effects, but in content and performance. The 1st True Grit is a 5 star plus film. This film was a sad disappointment and I'm glad I bought it cheap.",1311552000,5,1858,4.318051575931232

This movie is a tribute to the great John Wayne movie as well as to the book which is an under appreciated work of American fiction.

The acting was amazing even though I don't think Jeff Bridges was perfect for this role.  He seemed to be channeling more of the dude than anything else.  Still, he didn't try to mimic John Wayne and did a great job of making Rooster seem more realistic. All of the acting was great and to be honest, I had no idea it was Barry Pepper in his role.

It can be very difficult for a film that takes place so long ago to capture the audience, but this film's cinematography makes it easy to be totally absorbed into the 1800's.

4201559,4,B003UESJME,"FILM RATING:  3.5 stars

Writers/Directors Joel and Ethan Coen really redefined the idea of remaking an older film with their latest picture, True Grit (2010). For once, Hollywood has actually improved a movie by remaking it, which is more the exception than the rule. But the Coen Brothers really came through with a very good adaptation of the Charles Portis novel, that appears to be nothing like the original True Grit (1969) film, which I can't say I've ever seen. I'm not a John Wayne fan and that movie has looked too silly for my tastes from the bits of it I have seen.

After renting True Grit from Redbox on blu-ray last week, I gotta admit that I wish I had seen this movie in the theater along with all the other great movies I saw in the theater last year. I'll admit it...I was hesitant because I wouldn't say that I'm a Coen Brothers fan. So I figured I would wait for True Grit to come out on Blu-ray. And it was a worthy Blu-ray rental for sure. I guess with lower than normal expectations, True Grit surprised me! Although more and more, I'm coming to appreciate the Coen Brothers' work. While none of their films are in my Top 100 Movies of all time yet, I do really like and appreciate Fargo (1996) and No Country For Old Men (2007)...and now True Grit. Those are their 3 best movies in my opinion, all 3.5 star films.

What struck me right off the bat with True Grit was three things: the cinematography, the writing (i.e. the dialogue), and the acting. All three just impressed the hell out of me in the first 5-10 minutes. I just loved the crazy accents and pronunciations of the very juicy dialogue by everyone. Each actor brought something unique and special to their character, making everyone stand out, yet fit together as a misfit group. I also really loved the production design, because the modern western is something I've been into every since Lonesome Dove came out in 1989. Kudos to Production Designer Jess Gonchor.

If there is a singular reason to watch True Grit, it's the cinematography in my opinion. Director of Photography Roger Deakins is absolutely one of the best in the business. HIs body of work simply astounds me: Thunderheart (1992), The Shawshank Redemption (1994), Fargo (1996), Courage Under Fire (1996), Kundun (1997), House of Sand and Fog (2003), No Country For Old Men (2007), The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford (2007), Doubt (2008), The Reader (2008), Revolutionary Road (2008), and The Company Men (2010). And True Grit can now easily be added to that list as one of his best. I'm extremely excited to see his work on Director Andrew Niccol's upcoming film In Time (2011), coming out in October. The director of Gattaca (1997) has such a striking style, so combined with Deakins eye, it should be a real treat!

Deakins use of light, from bright sunny exteriors, to dark nearly pitch black interiors, to the subtle shades of dusk and dawn, provides a character of its own in this story. All the saturated shades of browns, greens, golds, blues, and other natural tones just pop on the blu-ray. There was no question that I wanted to see this on blu-ray and not on DVD. Its movies like this that High Definition was invented for. I'm naturally a sucker for landscape photography, since that's my background as a photographer. So I can really appreciate the work that Deakins did here to capture the beauty of ""The West"", both in its broad strokes and incredible textured details.

I've already mentioned how brilliant the writing of the dialogue is in this movie. The Coens were obviously working with incredible source material from the author, but they also managed to put their unique style for dialogue into the script as well. You can just tell it's a Coen Brothers movie when you listen to the characters speak. Its almost like there's a new language called Coenese out there. And of course the dialogue would be nothing without the incredible cast who delivers it with sharp panache. Casting Director Ellen Chenoweth perfectly matched each character with the perfect actor. Or at least the actors left no room for us to wonder.

At the center of the cast are Jeff Bridges, Hailee Steinfeld, and Matt Damon. If Bridges hadn't just won the Oscar for Best Actor for Crazy Heart (2009) the previous year, he certainly would have won for this role...even up against Colin Firth in The King's Speech (2010). Bridges is at his best here, just like I believe he was in Crazy Heart. Steinfeld also gives an amazing debut performance...especially for a 13-year old. But I'm not quite as enthralled with her acting in this movie as some critics and cinephiles have been. I felt it was very good, but not Oscar worthy. To my surprise, Matt Damon really pulls of his comedic role as LaBoeuf. He was funny, charming, and just plain good in this role. Supporting actors Josh Brolin, Barry Pepper, and the rest of the bit players, all did a fine job. I couldn't even recognize Pepper at first...it took a few careful studies of his character to pull the actor out for me.

The sound design and music on True Grit are top notch. Composer Carter Burwell creates the perfect score to accompany this unique story. And Sound Editor Skip Lievsay does a great job integrating all the various sounds together. There are many times during the movie that I really noticed how great the sound is on it. All of the foley work providing every little detailed sound was a perfect complement to the actor's voices and their unique accents.

While there is a lot to love about True Grit, the story falls apart in the third act. Once we are actually introduced to the bad guys, I started losing interest. Granted there was a lot of great filmmaking craft for me to focus on and keep me partially interested. But emotionally, I felt a bit let down with the resolution of the story. I'm not totally sure why, but I'm guessing that what I was much more interested in was the stories of the three main characters and their dynamics with each other, and less about the actual plot. The bad guys almost didn't matter and felt a bit forced. It seemed like young Steinfeld's capture was unnecessary and then hurried to get resolved so that the film could have a happy ending. I'm probably being nitpicky here and maybe I'm wrong. I'll admit that I really wanna watch this film again in a few months and reappraise it. I just know that I felt like the movie started much stronger than it ended. And so for now, I give it 3.5 stars.

It wouldn't surprise me if much like all of the other Coen Brothers' films I've seen, that True Grit grows on me over time. I really didn't care for or get Fargo when I first saw it. But then over time, it grew on me and I appreciated it more and more. I still think it has its flaws, like all of the Coen Brothers films. But I admire them for their unique vision and storytelling interests. And they are clearly incredible filmmakers in terms of their craft. The Coen Brothers could be compared to sauerkraut. You probably don't like them initially on their own, but you come to appreciate them over time in the right context.",1310774400,,7108,4.59338061465721

In my opinion it is almost a tie. I have never read the book; so, I cannot comment on the faithfulness of the adaptation.

Sterngths of the 1969 film:

The Duke wins hands down...imo Jeff Bridges gives a solid performance as Rooster Cogburn, but he cannot bring the character to the mythical level the Duke did in this and so many other roles.

The Colorado Locations.....They do not look like Arkansas, but they sure look nice.

A less bleak ending...enough said if you have not seen either film.

Robert Duvall as Ned Pepper........no brainer.

Dennis Hopper as Moon...............again no contest.

Strengths of the 2010 Film

Iris Dement.....her rendidtion of Leaning on the Everlasting Arms sends chills up my spine.

Carter Burwell..the score is magnificent..based in southern gospel music it gives a sense of gravity and impending doom that Elmer Berstein's score fails to do in the original.

The English language.........beautiful contraction-free cowboy Shakespeare

Matt Damon...beats Glen Campbell by a mile as the Texas Ranger

The Trip From Indian Territory to Fort Smith.....Without giving anything away, the movie shifts from a naturalistic style to a style used by Laughton in Night of the Hunter where stars are magnified as in the boat trip down the Ohio by the children ...This night scene on horse back is one of the great scenes in all of cinema............ dramatic and very moving..

Mattie is no ordinary girl, she is seeking revenge and hired the deputy Marshall Rooster Cogburn  ( Jeff Bridges) to help her track the man. A Texas Ranger (Matt Damon) is also on the pursuit of this man and together they make a trio.
This is a good movie and is aided by some great cinematography aided by the wonderful landscape of Texas and New Mexico. Acting is simply superb and I thought Hailee Steinfeld is amazing not just in dialogue delivery but screen presence as well. Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon are excellent, Josh Brolin is good in a very small role. Their chemistry is what makes the movie work. The soundtrack is superb especially the theme song by Iris Dement titled `Leaning on everlasting Arms'. The instrumental version is played throughout the film and adds another dimension to many pivotal scenes.

Jeff Bridges was a great pick to play the Cogburn character, but he never was able to do what Wayne could; be a drunkin' crass old fart and still be likable. Maybe it's the Coen brothers fault; who knows.
The actress that played the Matie Ross character seemed more like a high school drama student, and all-in-all the movie never topped the original; which when re-doing a movie, is the first ""bar"" you have to get over. Otherwise, what's the point?
This remake then completely falls apart near the end and even the ""older"" Matie Ross actress doesn't even come close to looking like the younger actress.

4201644,4,B003UESJME,"Sometimes too much of a fresh spin on a film that has seared itself into the conciousness of many just falls flat. For this kind of western novel turned film I believe it was welcomed though. The remake of a movie like Planet Of The Apes is an example of freshness bombing. Of course that was sci-fi, but the concept still applies.
  True Grit screams freshness that works on almost all levels. It needs to be viewed on blu ray (unless pristine analog is perfected, as I hope for)for optimum enjoyment. What literally astounded me was the dialogue. Words flowed of the charactors lips like shinning glass under pressure. This was a script designed to expound upon the forgotten gems of our English language. I recommend setting the English subtitles to catch one old west nuance after the other.
  The Cohen brothers doing a western is like Edgar Alan Poe being blown back as a  hippie. It's odd, different and yet effective. Jeff Bridges hands down, drew upon his body of acting experience to summon up his own brand of Rooster Cogburn. The story of a young girl persuing her fathers killer is done in a note by note fashion that reopens the old west.
  I am not a fan of Matt Damon but I can't take away from him how he grounded his charactor in shinning Texas Ranger style. James Brolin didn't pan out as I expected and fortunately it wasn't a complete story stopper. The scene where he encounters his young opponent in the river was more than a bit sloppy for me. A strong-driving climax with an added thoughtful ending made this a worthwhile cinematic experience. The comparisons made to the original don't hold up. This filmed delved richly into the novel and is purposely a different vision.  True Grit(2010) should be mandatory in English classes throughout the US.",1309996800,,1773,4.660256410256411
4201665,4,B003UESJME,"In general I do not like remakes. The original True Grit is one of my favorite movies. It is a movie I saw as a kid with my dad and of course that in and of itself makes it memorable. However, it was a my favorite western (along with Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid) that I had ever seen. So, I was very hesitant to go and see this movie when it came out. It was different to say the least, but, in most ways a good different. What struck me first, as the movie opened, was the religious aspect with a scripture and the music that greeted the viewer (To a degree, this was weaved throughout the entire movie). The young lady who played Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) was fantastic. She of course is a huge part of the movie and overall I thought she was a better Mattie than Kim Darby was in the original. Jeff Bridges is fantastic but I have a hard time in comparing his role as ""Rooster"" to John Wayne from the original. In my opinion any attempt to compare them in this role is senseless. To me, Rooster is John Wayne. I believe what makes Jeff so good as Rooster is the dialogue and the way he talks throughout the movie.  Matt Damon as LaBoeuf, the Texas Ranger, is pretty good but the character he plays and Glen Campbell played seem very different and they can't be compared. The movie has more humor than the original and the scenery the viewer is taken on seems a little darker in my opinion (This seems to be a Coen brothers trait). I have never read the book so I cannot make any assessment if the movie stays more true to the book by Charles Portis than the original. In the end I came away from this movie enjoying it quite a bit. Is it as good as the original? To me it is different and I think you have to look at this movie in that way. Familiar characters but two different movies and both quite enjoyable.",1309996800,,1826,4.172804532577904

If you haven't seen the original J.W. version then the latest release may get you by if you like Westerns but only one or two actors in this version are doing characters in an acceptable manner and most of them are not any of the main characters.

4201672,5,B003UESJME,"True Grit is a modern Western Classic.  I have seen a fair number of very well done Westerns such as Shane, The Searchers, Unforgiven, etc.  That said this is one of my favorites and ranks right up with some of the best.  It is the story of a teenage girl named Mattie Ross out to hunt down the outlaw (Josh Brolin) who killed her pa in Arkansas around 1878-1880.  She hires a drinking but trigger happy Marshal named Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges) to assist her.  Along the way they sometimes teamup with Texas Ranger Lebeouf (Matt Damon) seeking the outlaw for a seperate reward.  The only things standing in their way are rough terrain, bad weather, their own conflicting personalities, and of course a gang of well armed outlaws.

First of all the acting was excellent. I should note that despite being a big John Wayne fan I have never seen all of the original so I cannot fully compare Bridges' performance to the Duke.  That said Bridges does a masterful job at portraying Rooster Cogburn.  Just like the character in the novel, Cogburn in the film displays both a good dose of humor and clear lethality.  Hailee Steinfeld is superb as Mattie Ross.  Ross is a fascinating character in both the film and the novel.  Nice to see a devoutly Christian chararter as an intelligent protagonist but the character is also conversely rather saucy and somewhat ruthless.  Matt Damon, Josh Brolin, and Barry Pepper all deliver solid performances as well.

The cinematography conveys the sweeping landscape of the American west.  Sound editing is quite good.  The score has an interesting quality in that it is largely based on traditional church hymns--especially ""Leaning on the Everlasting Arms"".  This turns out to be quite appropriate for both the plot and setting.  One quality I like about True Grit is its ability to make one feel they are watching the nineteenth century.  Superb use of costumes and sets to accomplish this effect.

The action scenes but especially the climatic showdaown are well handled and not overdone.  The story itself moves from being fairly dark to quite humorous.  The plot actually stays surprisingly close to that of the book.  I would not recommend the film for younger children due to the violence.  Otherwise I highly recommend it to western fans.",1309737600,,2282,4.837209302325581
4201673,5,B003UESJME,"Before I get into the meat of my review let me say that the Western is my favorite genre of film.  I own the blu-ray of both the original John Wayne version of True Grit and this version.  People who say the original is ""better,"" in my opinion, just have ""good old days"" syndrome.  There is nothing about the old one that is superior.

Let's start with the story line.  The Coen brothers much more accurately capture the depth and genius of Charles Portis' novel.  The small details and nuances make this film's adaptation of the novel much more rich and rewarding.  The boarding house lady (and her boarding house),  Yarnell Poindexter (and his interactions with Mattie), the undertaker, the hanging, the sheriff, the stable boy, and more are all examples of this film creating a much more 3 dimensional and accurate story.

Next, this movie is one of the most beautifully shot films you will have seen.  Roger Deakins' cinematography is brilliant.  Look at the courtroom scene as just one example.  Where the 1960's film is very ""Hollywood does the old west"" with everything looking like a set from Bonanza, this film looks absolutely authentic.  They recreated Fort Smith to a T and the scenes during pursuit of Tom Chaney actually look like Arkansas rather than Colorado and California.

Third, the dialog is absolutely superior.  Keeping faith with the Portis novel, and in typical Coen brothers fashion, the dialog is terrific and VERY accurate to the period.  People don't realize that even the ""uneducated"" in the 1800's spoke with a vocabulary and formal sentence structure that today's college graduates would find challenging.

Last, the actors.  This is where people have their sacred cows.  No objective observer can honestly say that John Wayne's Rooster Cogburn was better than Jeff Bridges.  John Wayne wasn't a gruff, drunk, hardened ex-con turned lawman.  He was John Wayne with an eye-patch.  I love John Wayne, but in terms of an actor portraying a Character, Jeff Bridges absolutely nails the character.  He's an uncouth, unshaven, unbathed, smarmy, drunkard who happens to be a heck of a lawman and someone who truly does have uncommon ""grit.""  Likewise, Hailee Steinfeld is a much more realistic Mattie Ross from her hairstyle to her dress to acting to her age.

I don't have the time to describe all the ingredients that make this a superior film.  The more times I watch it, the better it becomes because I keep noticing even more attention to detail and quality in storytelling and filmmaking.

If you like westerns, this is a must have!",1309737600,18,2563,4.886310904872389
4201674,5,B003UESJME,"My usual stance on these modern day remakes of classic films is
""MEHHH!!"" or ""OH PUH-LEEZE!!""....
Yes, I have OFFICIALLY become the MEAN OLD MAN, whose seen it all, watched,
and heard all the best TV, Music & Movies in my lifetime!
Oh yeah, and those dad-burn kids better stay off my lawn and out of my yard!! (-:

It's just that, like millions of other people who are now either in or approaching middle age,
I get so tired of this unimaginative lazy modern Hollywood formula-franchise-faux reality-rehashed-remade
Micky Dee's-like assembly line entertainment of today.
Why even BROADWAY is doing SPIDERMAN and THE ADDAMS FAMILY for Christ's sake!
And you just KNOW that THE MUNSTERS and GILLIGAN'S ISLAND are next on the great white way! (-:
So many times these remakes fail miserably to capture even a tenth of the entertainment value
and substance of the original version...so I figure they should just give it up, and try something
(oh..I don't know) ORIGINAL to earn those massive paychecks that they're demanding now as writers,
producers, directors, actors, etc. out in Hollywood.

Anywayz, I must say that I was very pleasantly surprised by the Coen Brothers treatment
of the classic John Wayne western, TRUE GRIT...which is in the pantheon of the western film genre.
I enjoyed their re-telling of the story, but with a few twists and modern sensibilities to it
that didn't take away from the period in time that it was supposed to be representing.
THE WILD UNTAMED & LAWLESS WEST of the late 19th Century.
All of the actors; (a great cast!) Jeff Bridges (Rooster), Josh Brolin (Vicious Killer), Matt Damon (LeBoeuf),
and the young lady who played ""Hattie"", the 14 yr old girl bent on avenging her father's murder,
all did wonderful work, and brought a whole new dimension to the story.

The Coen Brothers approach to direction is usually unorthodox and quirky, but out of respect for
this particular piece, it seemed that they toned all of that down a bit and focused on directing
a brilliant new rendition of a classic film.  This worked perfectly in my opinion.
Might I add that this film was shot with the same great cinematography of the last one too...
You really appreciate the natural vistas of the western and southwestern scenery,
and the costuming stayed very true to period as well.
From the writing to the dialogue, coupled with the acting, they really found away to
re-invent a classic without making you feel that they were taking away from it.
They made an ol' crotchety cynic into a believer again!---Momentarily at least.
I, of course, rented this one first to see how I'd like it....
I was very impressed by it...I'll be definitely buying this to add to my collection.

4201699,5,B003UESJME,"I have to start by saying `True Grit' is another excellent film from the Coen brothers.  Some of their films can miss the mark, but when they get it right they hit the target dead on and with full force.

This film follows a 14 year old girl called Mattie as she goes about finding the man who murdered her father.  She is quick thinking, highly intelligent and full of sass.  She hires the grizzly old Rooster Cogburn (played by Bridges) to help her in her endeavours and together they make an unlikely, but effective duo.  There are also interactions with a Texas Ranger (played by Matt Damon) and gun fights and horse chases a-plenty.

The dialogue in this film is excellent and some of the lines Mattie and Cogburn come out with will have you roaring with laughter and appreciative of their eloquence.  This film has quite a gentle pace and yet this is juxtaposed with the odd gun fight which adds the needed spark to the film.

Everyone acts very well in this and I adore the accents of all involved.  Damon is great as the self righteous Texas Ranger and Bridges is simply wonderful as the time worn and hardened Cogburn.  I haven't seen Hailee Steinfeld, the actress who plays Mattie,  act in a film before, but I have to say I was highly impressed.  The direction is superb, with plenty of artistic shots of the wide landscapes that will leave you breathless and the gun fights and scenes with drama and action are tight and full of excitement.

Overall I have to say I enjoyed this more than I anticipated I would and it made for just under 2 hours highly entertaining viewing.  It's easily a film you could watch more than once and I am already looking forward to the next time when I will.

4201702,1,B003UESJME,"After this movie came out, I didn't get around to seeing it but heard the hype about it and knew it was a remake of a supposedly popular older movie. I was surprised that it had been subsequently ignored by the Academy Awards board. No awards, not even a mention of it. All the celeb commentators expressed surprise.

I recently rented it, remembering that I'd wanted to see it as I have a fondness for Westerns. Well....now I know why it was ignored.

Weak character development, strained acting, unconvincing characters, and no reason to care about any one of them. I found myself just completely unengaged by any of their concerns or quests.

The lead actress is competent enough in her dialogue and script recitation, but seems to try too hard to be ""hard"". There's little tenderness or warmth in her at all, and I found it hard to believe that she had any feelings about her dead father whose murder she's so keen to avenge. I don't blame her; she just wasn't well-directed.

There are other moments of sheer incredulity in the movie as well. For instance, at one point, Bridges and Damon have a shooting contest of accuracy, where they practice shooting at tiny pieces of cornbread thrown in the air. They dutifully, impressively split these small pieces of bread--but then are apparently completely unable to hit the broad back of a desperado fleeing across a river from them only 50 feet away? I found myself saying ""Come ON!?!""

Other parts are equally as preposterous, such as a snakebite for no earthly reason but sheer opportunistic plot padding. If you know anything about snakes, they don't  bite out of vindictiveness or ""meanness""--yet that's the only evident reason for this plot device. Ridiculous, honestly.

The Coen brothers are actually one of the best directors that handle with exquisite fluency the Noir lexicon. That's the main attractive of this existential movie loaded of the Noir spirit conveyed from the streets to the gelid lands of the Far West.

Jeff Bridges embodies with absolute perfection the role of the antihero. A sheriff without future or hopes for a better future. A despairing girl in search of poetic justice due her father's death, and the rest of the team conform a full rounded film that never decays. Perhaps this is the film with major poetic visual of the Coen brothers. Taking as reference the great landscapes of John Ford and the untamed territory, they captured the essence and added a magnificent device to shot the most cruel sequences at nocturnal hours, giving it so major mystery to this suspenseful tale.

Jeff Bridges, Hailee Steinfield, Matt Damon and Josh Brolin are simply out of this world with this impeccable remake.

Great cinematography was part of that classicism; the first time I visited the Grand Tetons, I knew every vista intimately from having watched ""Shane"" half a dozen times. The Coen Brothers give us that sense of landscape which is the emotional core of the Western as a genre.

Bridges, Brolin, and Damon ham up their roles relentlessly, but that too was part of the classic western genre, which included such hamsters as Roy Rogers, the Cisco Kid, and Gene Autry. Only later did the western go through a 'noir' bloodbath-and-nastiness phase. The Coen brothers have synthesized the Saturday matinee westerns of the 40s and 50s with the faux-realism of the later westerns.

And the girl Mattie Ross, played by Hailie Steinfeld, was miraculous!

4201723,3,B003UESJME,"I love Coen brothers' films, and their percentage of hits versus misses is impressively high. ""True Grit"" is a dud, though. It isn't so much the material as the treatment. The film is based on Charles' Portis' 1968 novel of the same name, which was first adapted for the silver screen in 1969, a film for which John Wayne won his only Academy Award. I have not seen the 1969 film, so I can only hope that this one is more interesting in comparison than it is on its own. It takes place in Arkansas of the late 19th century. Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) is a clever, headstrong 14-year-old come to Fort Smith to claim the body of her father Frank Ross, who was murdered by a ne'er-do-well employee named Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin).

Mattie is a shrewd, pushy businesswomen who manages to wrap up her father's affairs profitably, and she is not content to let her father's killer waltz off into Indian territory never to be seen again. She insists that  Chaney be brought to justice, and, when she finds out that only US Marshals have jurisdiction in the Indian Territory, she offers the meanest, most pitiless Marshal she can find $50 to find Chaney. Deputy Marshal Reuben ""Rooster"" Cogburn has shot 23 men in his 4 years on the job. He turns Mattie down, but the young woman has a way of imposing herself, and soon she is off on an adventure with the trigger-happy Marshall and a Texas Ranger named LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) who wants to bring Chaney in for killing a state senator.

Coen brothers films are fascinating for the astounding variety of perspectives on a fundamentally disordered universe that Joel and Ethan Coen endeavor to explore. They all have the same, very particular, world view. The differences are in how the protagonists cope with that world, according to their own personalities and limitations. The Wild West is, on the face of it, an ideal milieu in which to set this existential drama, as it is a harsh environment where people lived at the mercy of nature and of each other.

There are 3 protagonists in ""True Grit"", but we know Mattie better than the others, and the story is her recollection. There is a lot of black humor, which is welcome in an otherwise plodding narrative. Cogburn talks too much -and mumbles, at that. The film runs too long by at least 15 minutes, and most of it seems to be spent bickering. I found none of the characters the least bit interesting. Their adventure is dreadfully dull. And ""True Grit"" doesn't have anything interesting to say about their interaction with a world they can't control. I was left wondering what fans of Westerns will make of this film. Cogburn is a caricature, and LaBeouf is underwritten. Mattie is the only fully-written character.

After hearing that they were making another version of one of John Wayne's iconic movies, I was not interested. So, after seeing the original, which my family really likes, my dad and I went to see this movie on Christmas Eve. I was amazed.

Simple story, 14 year old farm girl hires a US Marshal to find her father's killer. They go on their journey with the help of a Texas Ranger, to take care of business. The cinematography is wonderful, the script was perfectly written and the performances from the entire cast were strong! Jeff Bridges was amazing, Matt Damon was really good, Josh Brolin was really good as well (even though he only had 15 minutes of screen time). Barry Pepper was convincing, too. But, Hailee Steinfeld stole the show.

This is simply amazing. One of the top 5 films of 2010. I can watch this over and over and I will not get tired of it. It's that good!",1308960000,,964,4.320441988950276

The portrayals of life in the West and the somewhat transient nature of frontier justice, as well as the unforgettable characters, made it a must-have. Having read the book I must say I enjoyed Jeff Bridges' Cogburn more than John Wayne's (I know, sue me), and I felt that the Coens' interpretation was more true to the original. The film is visually beautiful, and the dialog has all of that 19th-century sharpness and wit that is hard to come by in films today. It really is laugh-out-loud funny most of the time, in addition to being a fantastic and exciting adventure. Add to that Carter Burwell's simple-yet-brilliant soundtrack, which in itself is an excellent little piece of Americana, and you've got a simply excellent film that's fun for Western buffs and casual moviegoers alike.",1308960000,,820,4.906474820143885

I wanted to see more of Rooster and less of Matty's negotiations.  The court scene between Rooster Cogborn and the judge was much longer with more dialogue than was necessary.  Again, Wayne's version was crisp, to the point, and funny.  And I liked the end of John Wayne's version much better than the new one.",1308960000,4,637,4.439655172413793
4201760,5,B003UESJME,"Set aside the compelling yet implausible idea of a fourteen year old child chasing murderous thugs into the wilderness 140 years ago- or even now.

Ignore the intensity which newcomer Hailee Steinfeld brings to Mattie Ross- the central character whose pursuit of imperfect justice dominates every scene.

And most importantly, pretend you didn't see Rooster Cogburn kill four men with two pistols from horseback.

What is left? The easternmost borderlands of the Old West portrayed mostly as it really was, right down to the gallows.

The American writer Donna Tartt described the mountains, streams, meadows and forests just beyond Fort Smith across the Arkansas River as the very place where the ""chivalry"" of the old south merged with the Wild West.  Five years researching and telling stories about this place and what lies beyond it on the trails to California tells me that this is so.

And with all its minor flaws, the new True Grit confirms it all.

The characters, from emblematic Ned Pepper to the horseback medical quack in bear skin trying to peddle a corpse for cash on the trail authentically reflect the primitive conditions and eccentricities observed in abundant measure among the white intruders and storekeepers who found their way to the Indian Territory after the Civil War. The frontier structures, ferry crossings and dwelling interiors might well have been dropped in from the nineteenth century.

Beyond this, the terrain where the film was shot bears a striking similarity to the Winding Stair Mountains of eastern Oklahoma, although the vegetation is quite different.

Even the portrayal of the shy and courteous outlaw Cole Younger as a minor character near the conclusion of the film was authentic and consistent with anecdotes still told in his home town.

Although I had hoped to see a more detailed discussion of how the script was developed and differentiated from the John Wayne epic, the special features alone justified the price of this DVD. Anyone interested in the real American West should consider buying it.",1308960000,2,2050,5.110778443113772
4201761,2,B003UESJME,"First, I want to be honest, I am not an avid fan of westerns.  Also, I find Coen films to be over the top, always draped in the sackcloth of dark humor.  Why is it that American Cinema can never escape violence? Having said all that it somehow worked, and refreshingly so, for their movie Fargo, but this movie-making brother team has used it as a crutch too many times.

  From what I've read, the directors were more faithful to the book.  So, if you are a fan of Charles Portis you might like this movie.

  Personally, I found the marquee stars of the film were not the better actors of the film.  Hailee Steinfeld was superb, and Barry Pepper, although his role was small, was one of the few actors who didn't sound like Yosemite Sam when using a southern accent (really, Hollywood, get some better voice coaches!)  I'm from the south, I know what country people sound like....and that ain't it;)

4201763,4,B003UESJME,"Viewers watching two film versions of one story with virtually the same actions will differ in deciding which one they like best. It seems to me that the John Wayne version is better than the new one staring Jeff Bridges. I felt that both Bridges and Hailee Steinfeld, who played Rooster Cogburn and Mattie Ross, were too heavy handed in the way they played their rolls. Both worked to show dramatic effect without the humor that is present in the first film. For example, the fun was absent when Mattie bargained for the prices she wanted for her father's horses and when she haggled for other items. The first film spent more time on these events. As a result, we did not come to like Rooster and Mattie as we did in the John Wayne version. The ending of the first film was much more emotional. This new film added nothing to the drama by showing Mattie as a one-armed adult meeting famous western outlaws. The beginning of the Wayne movie was also better. It showed Mattie's father being killed and her and her mother's reactions. This was more effective than the narrator telling the viewers what happened in a brief account.",1308787200,2,1129,4.594059405940594
4201764,2,B003UESJME,"I have seen the original movie. This remake follows the original almost scene for scene. To the point that not only did I know what was happening but I could quote dialog. I realize both films were drawing from the same source material but it seemed like the Coen brothers read the Charles Portis novel and extracted pretty the same script as the 1969 version. They failed to differentiate their film enough from the original. It's an issue because, whether you like/dislike the original, it is the definitive version. If all you manage to do is remake the original with, admittedly, better cinematography and a different (I would argue worse) ending, why bother? People can go watch the original. There is nothing wrong with watching old movies.

Like others, I found Jeff Bridges dialog difficult to understand. More significantly, he lacks the charisma of John Wayne. I never found myself rooting for his character. But, most importantly, under all the cranky drunkenness John Wayne's Rooster Cogburn is a good man. He does what he does for his ""little sister"" because he is a decent and noble man. Bridges' Cogburn conveyed none of that to me. He seemed driven by the plot more than anything else. Certainly not any underlying tenderness for Mattie.

I enjoyed Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie but no more than Kim Darby's performance in the original. Hailee seemed too young. Darby's Mattie is a young woman while Steinfeld's Mattie is a girl. This difference in perception is creepily illustrated when Steinfeld's Mattie awakens to find Matt Damon's LaBoeuf character sitting in her bedroom and confessing to a thought of stealing kisses from her. The same scene in the original occurred in a dining room between Darby's older Mattie and Glen Campbell. Almost identical dialog in the two scenes but the remake was much darker in tone.

Damon's LaBoeuf was interesting. But with so much identical dialog between his and Campbell's LaBoeuf, I found I preferred the lines delivered by the very ""folksy"" Glen Campbell. I know John Wayne picked Campbell for the role himself and, while decent in the part, I can't help but wish someone had over-ruled John Wayne and given Robert Duval the LaBoeuf role rather than the Ned Pepper part.

Finally, yes, the endings are different. I still prefer the upbeat original ending to the downer the Coen brothers gave us. Closer to the book may be their explanation but it sounds more like an excuse; an excuse to remake the original with largely identical scenes and largely identical dialog. ""But ours is different,"" they say, ""See, we changed the ending and changed the tone."" So what? I still felt like I was seeing an expensive rehash of a film that can stand on its own perfectly well.

4201797,5,B003UESJME,"I am not trying to start a great debate--this is just a review of a film I have found to be entertaining every time I watch it.  I am old enough to have seen John Wayne's Oscar-winning performance as Rooster Cogburn in a first run theater and many times since.  Most people who dislike the Coen Bros version take issue with the attempt to remake a ""classic.""  I thought then and still think now that the original True Grit is a good movie, but not a great movie.  Similarly, Wayne's performance is good, not great.  You want to see Wayne's best performance, watch The Searchers.  Nevertheless, the original True Grit holds a dear place in many hearts, and I was surprised the Coen's chose this as their western project.  I was as skeptical as everyone else when I read Jeff Bridges would play Cogburn.  Bridges is an actor, but because of Wayne's portrayal and status as Hollywood legend, the role requires the qualities of an icon.  I think Bridges proves that great acting trumps a legend.  He totally inhabits the character, and I, for one, think he earned his Oscar nomination.  I recently watched The Big Lebowski, The Contender, and True Grit back-to-back (yes, I am retired), and there is no doubt Bridges is one of the best actors of our time.  Regarding True Grit (2010), the Coen's cast Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie, a role in which she is perfect.  How the Oscar went to Melissa Leo (whose work I respect very much) is now one of the many ""misplaced Oscar"" stories.  I found the language of the film, in particular Steinfeld's diction, realistic and refreshing.  Another improvement over the original is Matt Damon as Leboeuf.  Much of the film's sparse humor rides on the banter between Cogburn and Leboeuf, and I laugh out loud at their scenes together.  Just as important is the scene between Mattie and Leboeuf before he leaves camp.  Both actors achieve a credible tenderness, and the writing is perfectly understated.  I have seen this film in the theater, on DVD and on Blu-ray.

4201801,5,B003UESJME,"'True Grit' by Charles Portis has been a favorite of english teachers for decades because of how well written the novel is, how literate it is, and how true to the American west as it actually existed it was. It also helped that the protagonist is a 14 year old girl, making it an ideal assignment for literary analysis in schools by english teachers. 'True Grit'  was made into a movie starring John Wayne and Kim Darby and directed by Henry Hathaway in 1969. It is a great film and showcased an aging John Wayne at his best. However the film, as good as it was, did not reflect the uniqueness of Portis's novel and was a poor substitute for the novel. Along comes the Coen brothers.

The Coen's version of 'True Grit' is a truer visual enactment of the Charles Portis novel. it may not be as interesting to watch for many people as the Hathaway version. It has fewer laughs, less stereotypical western characters, an accurate spoken language portrayal that honestly reflects 1870's speech that may be difficult for some to follow, a mumbling inarticulate Rooster Cogburn (but still understandable), but it is also is much more realistic, more thoughtful, and a great deal less hammy film than the 1969 film version.

We also get brief (all too brief) interviews with the actors and a discussion of Roger Deakins' marvelous cinematography. ""Charles Portis: The Greatest Writer You've Never Heard Of"" profiles the author of the novel both films were based on giving us as much as is know about the author. It's a nice supplement and doesn't overstay its welcome at a little over a half hour. We also get the theatrical trailer for the film in high def.

If you're a fan of John Wayne's original film you may or may not like the Coen's slightly different take on the same material. The Coen's go for authenticity and a gritty style that was only hinted at in the previous film. Rooster Cogburn is portrayed by Jeff Bridges as much less of a loveable grump and a hard man with little in the way of qualities to make him someone you would like. Matt Damon does a marvelous job as LeBeof making the Texas Ranger a strange cross of lawman and dandy. The supporting roles for the film are all well cast and the film is filled with the Coen's characteristic off-beat sense of humor.

The original Wayne western was the dying gasp of the older styled Hollywood western quickly being replaced by Sergio Leone's epic westerns filled with anti-heroes and Don Siegel/Clint Eastwood's darker hued films that succeeded Leone's which featured characters in need of redemption but rarely searching for it. This version of ""True Grit"" tips its ten gallon tothe original film, the variety of westerns that have come before but still manages to establish a tone all its own.

Highly recommended.",1308528000,3,2556,4.737078651685393

It was the same basic story line and a lot of the same lines but with a twist. The slight differences made it just different enough to be enjoyable and not compare every second of the movie, although there were some parts that made me wish john Wayne had done them.

4201828,4,B003UESJME,"Firstly, Hailee Steinfeld's performance here is the stuff of legends.  Her turn as Mattie Ross is feisty and knowing that belies her tender years.  She reminds me of a young Jodie Foster or Natalie Portman.  Great things are in store for Steinfeld and I can't wait.  Roger Deakins' lenswork is evocative and lyrical and adds texture to the film.  Deakins' work is not show-offy and acts as a greek chorus to the proceedings.  Jeff Bridges' account of Rooster Cogburn only vaguely recalls John Wayne's work in the 1969 film, rather, he gives Cogburn characteristics only Bridges could imagine.  I admire the original film but I was never a huge fan of it.  The weakness in it and this version probably falls in the basic story based on the novel by Charles Portis.  The story is alright but nothing special just standard Western fare.  The Coen Brothers attempt to add artistic fluorishes to the story and succeed to some degree but cannot elevate this film to classic status.

For me, ""True Grit"" will be watched again from time to time, as frequently as ""Miller's Crossing.""  I marvel at the invisible directing of the Coens in ""True Grit.""

But when I heard it would be the Coen Brothers and Jeff Bridges would be stepping into those boots, I figured I'd give it a chance.  Even when the Coen Brothers stumble, they at the very least make an interesting film.

Now that I've seen it, I'm happy with it.  It's a finely-crafted film that stays close to the spirit of the book, especially its language.  Although we don't have Strother Martin as the horse-trader, I still enjoyed Mattie's bartering scene over ponies and a saddle.  Jeff Bridges continues on his role, making his own Rooster Cogburn--the way Richard Burton made his own Hamlet after Lawrence Olivier.

Hailee Steinfled was the only shining light in the whole movie but she couldn't save it from crumbling around her.  In general I love the Coen brothers' movies so I was truly expecting to add this to my list of favorites.  I'm glad I held out til the last 5 minutes because that was the best part.  If the rest of the movie could have had that tone I would have not been tempted to turn it off 50 times over.  I can appreciate the original for what it was but it's not my favorite genre.

4201835,5,B003UESJME,"Instead of comparing this 2010 take on the True Grit story to the film that featured John Wayne, you'd do better to read the Charles Portis novel on which both films were based. This 2010 effort is far more faithful to the actual story, so much so that I recognized plot and dialogue from the book even though I hadn't read it in more than 40 years. The Coen brothers clearly know how to take a great story and leave it intact while rendering it fit for the eye and ear. Jeff Bridges was more the real Rooster Cogburn than John Wayne ever was. Kim Darby's portrayal lacked the authenticity that Hailee Steinfeld brought to Mattie with the direct forthrightness that Portis wrote into the character. I know that when I finally get around to rereading the novel, I won't be seeing John Wayne in my mind's eye, but rather Jeff Bridges as I follow the bravado and courageous antics of Rooster Cogburn.

4201836,2,B003UESJME,"What can I add to all these reviews?  First the movie was shot beautifully and it looks first rate.  I am told this version sticks a bit closer to the original book.  Comparing the two movies, I don't believe there is a single character I didn't like better in the first and original movies with John Wayne.  While Jeff Bridges is a terrific actor, this was a role John Wayne was a perfect fit.  Even Glenn Campbell, with his goofy delivery was better in this role than Matt Damon.  Please understand, I believe Matt Damon and Jeff Bridges are superior actors in every way, but not in these roles.

James Brolin was far too good looking to play the role of Tom Chaney.  The last is a comparison with Kim Darby and Hailee Steinfeld.  Darby was 21 years old when she played Matty at 14.  Steinfeld was 14 playing 14.  Darby was more believable as a teenager.

The bottom line is, why redo a perfect movie if you can't improve it.  I didn't hate it, but it just didn't do it for me.  I'm glad I rented it instead of buying it.

The girl playing Mattie is excellent, and Matt Damon is a big improvement over Glen Campbell.  Josh Brolin is no better than Jeff Corey as Chaney, though, and Stother Martin steals every scene he's in as the original Col. Stonehill.  Robert Duvall is way better as Ned Pepper, and Dennis Hopper is a standout as Moon.  Too bad the Coens didn't trust the book's ending, Rooster getting hanged along with Tom Horn for that killing up in Wyoming.  Gotta say, though, if you've ever tried to hit anything with a Peacemaker, you'll find the scene with Rooster trying to hit the bottle flat out hilarious.

The key is Rooster.  Jeff Bridges turns in a fine acting job.  John Wayne, however, just was Rooster Cogburn.  And that's the point of John Wayne's triumph and the brilliance of his performance: it doesn't look like a performance.  I'm no Duke fan, but he shows how it's done in that movie.  That was acting.

Hailee Steinfeld steals the spotlight and is the reason why anybody enjoys this version.  Matt Damon portrays a character (Texas Ranger) that doesn't let him shine as an actor, and as he holds back to let the other main characters have a better shot at the Oscar, it subsequently takes a lot away from how much the viewer enjoys this remake.  One of the trivia details about this film was John Wayne was 62 when he portrayed Rooster Cogburn, whereas Jeff Bridges was 60.  The character is supposed to be 40 yrs of age at the time this story's theme intended.  The redundant song heard over and over is the old hymn ""Leaning On The Everlasting Arms.""  ""Keep On The Firing Line"" is another hymn that is part of the soundtrack.  You have to let go of adoration for John Wayne, but even then this film lacks what it SHOULD have been because it seemed Jeff Bridges had a dozen marbles in his mouth 90% of the time he said anything.  Other than that, it is a decent western, and except for a few slow moving parts that at times was a bit tedious, the costuming, sets, and scenery are actually above average.  Some of the FX includes some brutal scenes of violence which is why the movie got the rating it has.  You'll need to try not to compare this 2010 film with the 1969 version.  If you can keep them separate, even though Jeff Bridges needs to fire his coach that instructed him how to talk tough guy US Marshal, I believe you can agree this film deserves at least 3 stars.

4201887,5,B003UESJME,"This is a great film.  A beautifully made western in a time when western films regardless of quality are a rarity.

I will start off with a complaint though...somebody correct me if I'm wrong...but I could not find the movie trailer with Johnny Cash's ""God's Gonna Cut You Down"" soundtrack.  This is a great trailer and should have been included with the DVD.

As for the film...it's laced with action, adventure, intense moments, lots of comedy, great acting and is a western masterpiece.  While it's not like the typical Coen film....it's by far my favorite.

Bridges shows some decent humanity behind his fearless thinking and even more fearless actions against very dangerous and outnumbering adversaries.  The comic relief between Bridges and Damon is very delightful...but the surprise of the film is Steinfeld...who is seemingly born for this role of Mattie Ross.  She's tough, witty, and beyond her years in maturity.  She handles Cogburn and LeBeuf with equaled toughness and compassion.

The real strength of this film is it's: (1) clever and very well researched writing, (2) soundtrack and (3) well casted players from top to bottom.  Credit the Coens who are master storytellers and as with past films are again at the top of their game.

Maybe I'm slightly biased as I love both western movies and Coen films...what a wonderful marriage.",1308009600,3,1351,5.036036036036036

I had fond memories of seeing the John Wayne film as a child, but viewing it with more critical adult eyes, it's schlocky and whitewashed.

Plot, dialogue, cast, music, art direction (costuming & sets), & cinematography are all finely-crafted and evocative of the spirit of both the novel and the times in which the story is set.  How any movie lover could write a negative review of this masterwork is beyond me, but there's no accounting for taste. The last 20 minutes or so are pure poetry.  Oddly enough, the only scene which I felt was a little lacking was the climactic shootout, although I felt the same about the scene in the original movie.  This version is far superior to the Wayne version in every respect, although that film had many good elements among the bad (such as the casting of LaBeouf).  Anyway, if you pass this up based upon the haters' comments, you are missing one of the best films of the last ten years or so...and certainly the best film of 2010.

While the acting and faster pace is slightly more enjoyable in this newer film (particularly the acting of Hailee Steinfeld who is able to be far less irritating than the old Mattie)the end feels highly unsatisfactory. I believe that the ending only held one improvement to the original (the fate of LaBoeuf), but for the rest I'd stick with Wayne. I'm confused when critics claim that this version is far closer to the book, when in fact both versions follow almost word for word with minor variations.

Either way, both this and the original are worth watching, the only thing that really keeps me from giving five stars to this version is what I've already called a highly unsatisfying end.

4201892,1,B003UESJME,"I am amazed at a few of the comments here.

First, the one about the Coen's creating an original script. I saw both versions and I felt like I was watching someone else mouth the words from the original version most of the time. The only thing original are the parts that weren't in the original movie in most cases.

Second, is the comment that anything that is based on an existing piece of work, book or other work, can't be a remake. It's a remake of the original movie not the book. Any time there is already a movie released and another one is made that essentially copies the first then the second is a remake.

Third, I agree that there is no need to re-make a classic. Besides, can't the writers come up with something new? I read an interview with Clint Eastwood a while ago and he said that they should lock up all the writers in a room and not let them out until they come up with a new script. Things must sure have gone down hill when you have to do TV shows as movies because you can't come up with any new material.

I understand that opinions differ so I have to say in my opinion this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I do agree with any comments made about the young girl who played Matty Ross. She did a very good job considering the circumstances and the terrible dialog she had in the cases where the Coen brothers strayed away from the original.

I stated in my first review that staying true to the book is not always a good thing and I felt I must repeat the fact. The book may read well but it just doesn't translate well to the screen, just like Stephen King books.",1307923200,4,1602,4.15483870967742

Along for the ride is a simpleton-ish Texas ranger (Matt Damon), and it isn't long before they're on the trail.  For those unfamiliar with the original True Grit, or westerns in general, the film may come off as a bit unimpressive.  For everyone else however that enjoys the introspecive qualities that many of the best westerns of the era possessed, this remake is a pure treat.

If you're looking for action, you're probably in the wrong place.  There is some action but the main point of the story is character development.  Basically you have a character obsessed with revenge, a character who earns redemption for all the lives he's taken, and matt damon (the character was basically a throwaway character).

About the ending I believe it was a turnabout; changing the roles of the character.

I didn't think he could pull off the role. But he does, admirably. From the story line, to the cinematography, to the acting, to the ambiance, it was a marvel.

I have one quarrel, however, and that is that the real star of the film, Hailee Steinfeld, does not get top billing. Or at least second place after Bridges. In the film, Mattie tells Rooster that she chose him because she's been told he has ""true grit."" But while the old drunk has admirable characteristics in spite of his drunkenness, it is Mattie who genuinely has true grit. She leaves her family at the age of 14 determined to seek vengeance upon her father's murderer, and she repeatedly keeps her little expedition together when others are ready to give up. She faces the hardships with equanimity and determination. It is Mattie, not Rooster, who is really the title character. And Hailee Steinfeld plays the role more convincingly and more competently than I'd ever have expected from an actor of her age.

Jeff Bridges wasn't any comparison to John Wayne in the original, He just mumbled and did a bad job with the character.

Despite reading the book and seeing the original film version the viewer will likely not be prepared for this version of the Charles Portis novel.  Much of that is in the screenplay as written by Joel and Ethan Coen; the dialogue is definitely not contemporary but is as things might have been uttered during the timeframe of the piece. This adds considerable authenticity and rawness, AND humor to the story.

Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld - the weak point in casting) is compelled to bring her father's murderer Tom Clancy (Josh Brolin) to justice. A girl of fixed purpose (and strange knowledge of Latin and law....) she hires US Marshall Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), an alcoholic reprobate of a old cuss who has the one attribute Mattie needs - true grit.  The two set out on Clancy's trail, at times assisted by Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon, who shines here), chasing Clancy and the gang led by Lucky Ned Pepper (Barry Pepper, hardly recognizable), and after much killing and mangy incidents justice of sorts is served.  The ending of the film gets a bit sappy but leaves the audience a chance to clear heads before the film credits begin.

Aside from the terrific dialogue, other attributes of this version of the story include first class acting by all concerned including some exceptional cameos by Ed Corbin as the Bear Man, Domhnall Gleeson as the kid Moon, Jarlath Conroy as the Undertaker and Paul Rae as Emmett Quincy, extraordinary cinematography by Roger Deakins who manages to give the Coen Brothers some spectacular scenery and atmosphere - the Old West the way we've seldom seen it, and a musical score that relies heavily on old Baptist church songs.

The only more recent western that delivers with such emotion and historic accuracy is ""Unforgiven"".
Sadly, this remake doesn't even come close and will disappoint many whether they have seen the original or not.
The documentary beginning and ending of the movie were beyond strange. The ending is bizarre. It's as if the director had wanted to make sure everyone left the movie revolted and depressed.
Throughout, the movie is disjointed as if edited by an amateur with an axe. There is no flow.
The pony negotiation scene falls flat and lacks clarity. There are several scenes that seem out of place, unnecessary and don't advance the story. Then there's the unneeded shock and gore.
Many times the music seemed inappropriate and irritating injected itself into the flow of the movie.
It was if someone had set out to make a mockery of the original and a social statement about our violent past. Rooster Cogburn in the outdoor toilet and the one-armed women.
The acting by Jeff Bridges is OK but not one of his best. The characters portrayed by Matt Damon and Hallie Steinfeld just didn't ring true and at times seemed forced. Josh Brolin (Chaney) and Barry Pepper (Ned Pepper) were good.

The scene where Cogburn and Mattie come upon the body hanging from the tree in this version was not in the original and I didn't really see a reason for it as it had no pertinence to the story, but it was pretty much the exception to the plot otherwise. I also must say that the ending of this version was very bleak compared to the wonderful conclusion of the original with Wayne jumping the fence on his horse which I much preferred (""well, come see a fat old man sometime!"")...and I do wish Bridges had put more animation in the scene where Cogburn asks Mattie what she has in the poke (""that's a Colt's Dragoon...""!).

4201953,2,B003UESJME,"First off, I do applaud, as others have, the ambition of the Coens in tackling this one. There are a few iconic Westerns out there that, in my view, shouldn't be remade -- the original TRUE GRIT among them. But, having said that, who better to attempt it than the Coens.

That being said, let's get to it!

I love reviewers who complain about ""John Wayne just playing John Wayne!"" It is, in my thinking, a remarkably stupid thing to say. Still, critics over the years have made the same rationalization when assessing the Duke's work. Ironically, the very same thing might arguably be said of James Stewart or of Henry Fonda or of Clint Eastwood or of Robert Redford. The great ones are great because they have us believing they ARE who they play and not the other way around. In other words John Wayne IS Rooster Cogburn just as he IS J.B. Books, Wil Anderson, J.D. Cahill and Jacob McCandles, just to name a few. And when a performance becomes so ingrained in the minds of movie goers, as John Wayne's depiction of Rooster Cogburn has, there's absolutely no getting around it. PERIOD.

Some will say, ""Well, I like Jeff Bridges better."" Absolutely acceptable. Glad the new portrayal worked for you. It, however, did not for me.

Bridges, while a talented actor, was simply in over his head. Absolutely drowning even before he entered the water! How do you go head-to-head with a legend? You cannot dismiss the original performance. After all, very likely Bridges was raised with it. So how do you go about it? Costuming changes? After all, Cogburn doesn't wear an eye patch in the book. Why not that? Maybe gain a ton of weight and grow a long, handlebar mustache for the same reason. But, because Wayne IS Cogburn, it would have been box office suicide. In this particular case, it seems Bridges attempted to monotonize the character all together. No emotion! NONE! Dead pan, half-drunk mumbling is all that emerges in every scene. Oh! And he does put on a farmer's hat! Even in the famous ""FILL YOUR HANDS, YOU SONOFABITCH!"" Stand off with Lucky Ned, Bridges manages no more than a drunken mumble! Heavens! Even Barry Pepper, starring as Lucky Ned -- the role made originally famous by a young Bob Duvall -- is far more appropriately animated when compared to Bridges' Cogburn in this signature scene.

Obviously, Matt Damon comes across far better than his counterpart in the original, Glen Campbell. At least Damon didn't attempt to sing the theme song while, over the years, all of us have wondered why Campbell attempted acting.

No. The only real bright spot in this movie is Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie Ross. Fresh. Quick. Spot on. Oh, sure! Kim Darby has been panned over the years for her overly perky portrayal. But, if you read the book, you'll see that Darby did rather well and you can easily tell that Steinfeld takes many of her cues from Darby's performance.

And then there's the music. Composer Carter Burwell was faced with just as impossible a task in his work as Bridges was in his. How do you compete with Elmer Bernstein when it comes to music in the Western movies. And, you guessed it, Burwell handles his calling just about as well as Bridges did his!

And forget all of the dialogue about this version being truer to the book. Absolutely not true. It's just that the Coens chose some things to include while leaving others out. The same is true of the original. But that's movie making, isn't it? You simply cannot include everything and the new movie is no exception there.

Now, don't get me wrong. The cinematography is classic Coen. Beautiful and stark. Unmistakable. This movie is worth watching for that alone.

But, all things being considered, I can manage only two stars.

Also, today's films become award-winners and box office hits but rarely become classics because they aren't savored over the years like older films had been prior to VHS, DVD and cable.  Films are rarely re-released in theaters and when they are they are ""new improved"" versions.  Classic film festivals are not as common.  Network (edited) debuts on TV are no longer the event they once were.  Sequels were once made to allow the public just one more glimpse of a fond character.  John Wayne's version had the ability to be an award-winning box office champ before VHS.  This meant when it was re-released in theaters and then shown on network TV, the public sought it out because it wasn't readily available on video three months after it was released.  How many people said they would give Jeff Bridges' movie a  chance but wait for it on DVD....and then lost interest?  In 3 months!!!  Jeff Bridges name won't be associated with TRUE GRIT in the same way as John Wayne's name.  John Wayne placing the reins in his mouth, the revolver in his left hand and spinning his rifle in the right will forever be the iconic image associated with TRUE GRIT.  Gary Cooper in HIGH NOON, Alan Ladd in SHANE.  John Wayne in TRUE GRIT.  No matter how many remakes they will never be replaced.  The collective embrace of a film plays a large role in making a film a true classic.",1307577600,2,2046,4.698591549295775

4201970,5,B003UESJME,"It still baffles my mind that some are STILL voiting this film down and comparing it to the John Wayne film, still calling it a remake.  If something is based on a previously published work, like a book, comic, or play, then making it more than once does not mean the latter versions are remaking the first.  To clear this up for all time, let me point this out, how many times has Hamlet or Romeo and Juliet been made into films(all based on a stage play)?  Was Kenneth Branaugh's mid 90's film a remake of the early 90's version of Hamlet or was it a remake of the Olivier one?  Or was it a remake of a specific production of the play on stage?  Yeah, none of the above, it was a new adaption of the written play.  Get it?  I knew that you could.

I love Charles Portis' writings and I love his novel True Grit.  It's one of my top favorite pieces of literature.  I hold his works up there with Mark Twain and Shakespeare!  Now I don't dislike the John Wayne film.  I like it.  It's not a great movie, and it's certainly not the best John Wayne film(that belongs to Rio Bravo if you ask me).  Sure, he won his first and only Academy Award for it, but I think that was more for his body of work and not so much for that particular role.  The original is an okay adaption of the novel.  I found Wayne's version of Rooster Cogburn to be watered down and made more likeable.  It's basically John Wayne with a different name.  Here, thanks to the Coen Brothers, we get a truer representation of these characters and what the book was really about.  The most important thing about this film adaption and what makes it the book is the fact that it is told 100% from Mattie's point of view.  This is what made the book great and original especially when it comes to Westerns.  No, not all events are the same, not all scenes from the book are here, and YES things have been added to replace things from the book.  This is a MOVIE.  This is NOT A BOOK.  Book's have freedom, films do not.  All changes were made to give it it's visual nature and to get to the themes and story points faster in terms of how films are told.  If you still don't get that, then you are lost.

This is truly a Coen's brothers film.  It looks and feels like one.  But it is so close to the book, like what they did with their masterpiece No Country For Old Men.  The only thing that a hardcore Coen Brother's fan, like me, could discredit this film for is be the most straight ahead film they've ever made.  There's really no Coen Brothers quirks to it.  It's to the point, with no sidetracks.  No Country fit their style and type of stories they like to tell, so it meshed together.  Here we have a basic Western with themes of losing innocence, but a damn well made and acted one.  This film is exceptionally directed and designed.  There isn't one misjudged moment or bad performance.  Roger Deakins(a usual collaborator of the Coens) make a beautiful picture while keeping a realistic view of the gritty, down and dirty West.  The vistas feel real, but the time and people don't seem romanticized.  Great.

One can't say enough about the acting in this film.  Newcomer Haley Steinfeld(who was righfully nominated for an Oscar for her portrayal in this film) shines in every moment.  She never once feels like a modern teenager playing in the old West.  She fits right in, from her speech to her mannerisms.  No cloying kid here.  She's a real person, a determined and self righteous person who has to learn the hard way that the best laid plans don't always follow through.  Jeff Bridges has the flashiest role, of course he is playing the immortal Rooster Cogburn.  Of course Bridges leaves Wayne's portrayal in the dust, Bridges is a great actor, while Wayne was simply a great movie star.  Bridge mumbles, stares down, and convincingly plays drunk while never losing his hard edge or making the audience dislike him.  This is the best role and best performance he's given in a long time, even better than his Oscar winning role in Crazy Heart.  Matt Damon is sublime in a role that had the weakest acting link in the original film, which was sad because he is such a great character in the book.  He brings comedy in his hubris and state pride for Texas.  His and Bridges chemistry could work in ten more movies.  Now this character has been mildly toned down from the book.  While they keep his disdain for Mattie in, they soften it ever so slightly.  Finally, we get our villains played by Josh Brolin and Barry Pepper.  Bother are great and memorable, which is amazing considering they have the least screen time.  And calling them villains does a disservice to the writing, especially how they are portrayed in the movie.  Yes, they're bad, killers, and outlaws but they are played as real people doing what they need to do to get by.  While Brolin's character is a sociopath, Pepper's character seems more like a trashy business man just trying to get by in a world where the hand he was dealt wasn't the best.

The blu ray looks and sounds amazing.  Deakins photography looks beautiful.  The only thing that is unfortunate, but I'm used to it when it comes to Coen Brothers movies, is the lack of their involvement and their voices on the special features.  I would love for them to talk about how they adapted the book and their reason for taking this classic to the big screen for a second adaption.  What we do get is great but short.  Behind the scenes with Mattie Ross is basically a showcase for newcomer Steinfeld who comes off just as smart and sassy as the character she plays in the film.  Outfitting the Old West is a great featurette regarding the design and costuming of the film and how they reached and strived for authenticiy.  There's a similar feature regarding the weapons used in the film.  There is a feature interviewing the cast but it's mostly fluff where they go on praising each other, which isn't unwarranted, but it's not that deep.  Finally, we get some features about the building of Fort Smith and a focus feature on Roger Deakins.  All good, if you're into that stuff.  The greatest feature for me on this disc is a mini doc called Charles Portis-The Greatest Writer You've Never Heard Of.  It goes over his starts, his career, and his greatest works in much depth.  It interviews other authors and admirers of the great author.  I wasn't expecting something like this and I hope it peaks enough interest for more folks to seek his works out.  It's a fitting doc considering how detached this film is from the John Wayne film and how it is so much more in the spirit of Portis' prose.

This film is a great straigh forward Western that belongs in the ranks with Rio Brave, The Good The Bad and The Ugly, Once Upon a Time in the West, Outlaw Joesy Whales, Cat Balou, and of course Unforgiven.  It's funny, exciting, emotionally resonant and better made than any film made last year on the level of writing, directing and acting.

PS: This film is rated PG-13.  Although, somehow it does have two moments of graphic onscreen violence.  I felt like I was watching an R rated film.  I am supposing the MPAA justifies this by the fact that there are very few violent moments in the film, so it's okay to be graphic.  I don't know.  I do know that the MPAA is a political thing, a money making thing, that really has no use anymore.  Filmmakers should censor themselves and the viewing public should be respected enough and informed enough to judge what they find offensive.  We're not all the same.",1307491200,2,7509,4.443548387096774

The personalities of every character have been washed out to no more than line readers in western clothing.  There is no emotion or ownership in the actor's performance which led to having no connection to the film by me.  It is a shame that so many parts of the story were removed or glossed over so quickly that there is little or no time to relate to the characters.  It is a shame that the director of this film pushed good actors to remove any personality from their acting and deliver each word as if they were monotone computers.  Not worth the time.",1307491200,20,646,4.394957983193278
4201973,5,B003UESJME,"Contrary to what Roger Ebert (whom I almost always agree with) says, ""True Grit"" /is/ very much a ""Coen brothers"" film, just as ""No Country for Old Men"" was. The latter novel /reads/ as if it had been written by the Coens, and I expect the Portis ""True Grit"" is not far-removed.

""Needless to say"", the remake is far superior to the original. The Coens built their careers on the strange and off-kilter, the weird beneath the normal, which makes them ideal interpreters of a Portis novel. Their version captures -- what should I call it? -- the oddness of everything. The 1969 version is deadpan and bland.

I have problems with two of the performances, though. Hailee Steinfeld is an obviously talented young woman. Unfortunately, she has to deliver long, densely worded speeches in Mattie's overly precise manner. This is not unlike playing a Paganini violin concerto! The words too-often blur together, not only making the dialog harder to understand, but undercutting the humor of her mannered speech and overbearing nature. This is not her fault, but the Coens'.

And though I adore Jeff Bridges -- unquestionably one of the all-time-great American actors -- he too-often overplays Rooster. Yes, he's an infinitely better actor than John Wayne, but he lacks (or fails to put on) Wayne's gravitas, which allowed the Duke's drunkenness to seem part of the character's personality. I decided that, as ""True Grit"" /is/ a comedy, I would play along. But Bridges could have done better.

Bridges has another problem. He's always been boyish-looking, and has one of the winningest smiles in movies. But as that boyishness has been overlaid with a handsome cragginess, the smile looks more and more out of place. When he smiles, he cannot avoid ""breaking character"", and we see the happy, well-adjusted human being he is. Bridges' best moments come when he /isn't/ speaking, and we see how a gifted actor uses his face to convey everything.

Am I the only person who noticed that Barry Pepper seemed to be channeling Robert Duvall? Though not trying to imitate the timbre of Duvall's voice, the way Pepper delivers the lines, and his hand gestures (particularly) are decidedly Duvallish. Indeed, there's even a passing physical resemblance to the 40ish Duvall.

The cinematography, beautifully captured on the Blu-ray, is magnificent. Many of the outdoor-daylight scenes have an other-worldly pale and washed-out quality (but without burned highlights) quite unlike anything I've seen in a Western.

This is a wonderfully entertaining film, practically perfect in every way. I was particularly impressed by the opening scenes, which nearly tear out your heart -- not something the Coens are noted for. Strongly recommended.",1307491200,2,2720,5.112612612612613

4202007,5,B003UESJME,"How can you possibly go wrong with a Coen Bros movie?  Other than The Hudsucker Proxy, every one has been a masterpiece of acting and creativity.

First, let me say I have never seen the original with John Wayne.  I never found him to be a convincing character in the few movies he did that I have actually watched.  I understand that True Grit may have been his best performance, so I will withhold comparative judgement.

I also have to say that I was disappointed when I heard this was going to be their project for 2010.  I had only the sketchiest idea of the story and most of my ideas about it were wrong.

All that being said, I loved this movie!  I rented the standard version from Netflix, and halfway through the watching, found myself ordering the Blue-ray edition from Amazon.  I absolutely identify with Hailee Steinfeld's character, Mattie Ross.  That's a whole other story.  Let's just say my outspokenness and inability to accept authority and others' definition of my role in this world have led me to take the risks that are not always the definition of feminine behavior...

Jeff Bridges has become a master actor, and the difference between this role and the first movie I remember him in, King Kong, are unbelievable.  While I still believe his best role was ""The Dude"" in the Big Lebowski, ""Rooster Cogburn"" was still an amazing transformation which really showed the depth of his skills.  In its own right, this role redifined his career.  He is in an all new mode as an actor and artist.

While Matt Damon has added a different depth to his acting in this piece, I am not sure he was the best choice for his character, and may be a slightly weak component.  He was very professional, but not completely believeable.  Timothy Olyphant of Deadwood fame, in a rougher form, might have been a viable alternative.  The character needed a bit more roughness.  This is not a major issue for me.

Josh Brolin's character may have made more impact with a bit more development, and I certainly wouldn't have minded another 20 minutes of wonderful acting.  Since I have not read the original book, I don't know if there was actually any more development.  This is what happens when a movie leaves you wanting more, which almost all Coen Bros pieces have accomplished from Blood Simple on.

This will be a revered part of my Coen Bros library.  I watch nearly every one but Hudsucker every year.  All are better than almost anything else ever produced.  I have special favorites, but all are on the top shelf in a place of honor.

Until I watched it, I wasn't sure it would fit...Silly me!  I don't know if I will ever watch the original.  This has defined the story for me, so unlike many other reviewers, I am not and will likely never compare this with the one from the 70s, so yes, my views may be skewed for the Coens.

I urge anyone reading this review to put aside dogmatic prejudices against remakes, even though I often find little interest in any sort of remake.  This is a piece of art unique unto itself.  It is its own work, and I don't know if comparisons are even called for.  You see an utterly believable period piece with immaculate detail and superb acting.  In some ways it does remind me of Jim Jaramusch and Johnny Depp's wonderful, but underrated black and white masterpiece, Dead Man.  The authenticity is amazing, and yet the creativity of the production is almost overwhelming.

Take it as it is, and enjoy it for its own merits.

I have heard nothing but good things about this movie, but I am a huge John Wayne fan and did not think this sould be re-done.  I will admit that Jeff Bridges is a great pick to take over for The Duke.  After watching this I noticed that it is nothing like the original at all (it has been a while since I have seen it though), so much so it's almost hard to compare the two.  That being said, I really enjoyed this movie a lot more then I expected to.  This is far and away the best western that has come out since ""Open Range"", and my favorite Coen Brothers movie since ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"".  Bridges does a great job of making the part his own, and Hailee Steinfeld (in a break-out preformance) does a fantastic job of holding her own against the heavyweights of the movie.  If you go in looking for a re-make of the John Wayne version you will be dissapointed.  If you are looking for a different take on it then you will enjoy this one.  Very, very good movie.  Overall I would say that with all the hype behind this movie, it does a good job of living up to it.  I give it an A-.

4202011,1,B003UESJME,"Myself and my wife were really looking forward to this film, due in large part to the hype surrounding the movie and the Coen brother's reputation for originality.

Imagine our surprise when this clichd ridden, boring, unoriginal piece of dross hit our screens. It was not just the clichd writing and predictable turns which annoyed us, but also the acting. Most of the time we couldn't understand any of the muttered ramblings coming out from Jeff Bridge's mouth but worse still was the precocious child playing the lead role.

Her brashness was not cute, nor was her naivety which was pushed into our faces at every given opportunity when it appeared that she was getting too smart. Her toughness and perseverance are right out of a modern-day girl-power chick flick rather than qualities that naturally emerge from her character as the film progresses.

I guess the good points about this film would have to be the authenticity of the set and costumes and some of the lines were intelligent, if not smugly delivered and at times wooden. It is a shame that during most of the dialogue I was very aware that I was watching actors reciting words from a script. I think this is a good example of clever lines looking far better on paper than being delivered by the actor.

I did not even find the Coen brothers surrealist humour to be particularly droll either.

4202014,5,B003UESJME,"The Coen Brother's reworking of Charles Portis's novel TRUE GRIT is not quite what you'd expect from the makers of NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN and FARGO.  It's not dark, it's not depressing, and there's very little sense of anarchical chaos.  The film is more in line with the spiritual undertones of O BROTHER WHERE ART THOU?, without that film's campy rumpus (or George's Clooney's hair).  It's a serious piece, with dashes of humor, that never takes itself seriously.  It's a more-or-less uplifting tale of challenges and proving your worth.  The film follows young Protestant girl Mattie Ross, whose father has been murdered by Tom Chaney.  Mattie recruits alcholic Marshall Rooster Cogburn; tagging alone for the ride is Texas Ranger LaBoef.  Together, they track down Chaney, face down an evil gang of ne'er-do-wells, and become fast and lasting friends in the process.

That's right--this is (almost) family-friend Coen Brothers.  But don't let that deter you.  The Coens inhabit Portis's pretension-vs.-violence world like a second skin.  The film hews closely to the novel, as the Coens did with Cormac McCarthy's NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN.  This means that the language feels clunky at first, though coming from Hailee Steinfeld, it feels natural, even poetic.  Steinfeld is a true find--this is her film, and she manages to hold her own against her formidable costars.  That list includes Jeff Bridges, sinking his teeth into the role of Cogburn; Matt Damon, affecting a faux-nonchalance as LaBoef; Josh Brolin, thoroughly menacing (and slightly pitiful) as Chaney; Barry Pepper, absolutely fantastic as gang leader Lucky Ned Pepper; and other actors who've made their way into previous Coen collaborations.  The fact that the three leads were all nominated for major awards (Steinfeld and Bridges for Oscars) says something; the fact that two of the most prominent stars, Barry Pepper and Josh Brolin, take on relatively minor roles, suggests their dedication to such a fine work of cinema.  And you can't ignore the other eight Oscar nominations, either--including Best Screenplay, Best Directing, Cinematography (Roger Deakins, back again), and Motion Picture of the Year.

Overall, TRUE GRIT is another Coen Brothers masterpiece.  It's different from their others--this is a Coen film you can take your kids to see.  They'll get a little scared in spots (the film does get intense), but they won't be scarred for life.  But don't let that fool you, or sway you from seeing the film--it's 100% Coen Brothers, another fine work of art in their catalog.",1307318400,4,2557,5.160194174757281

The Film 4.5/5

True Grit was nominated for 10 Oscars, but failed to win any. Jeff Bridges was unlikely to win after finally being recognized a year ago, but Roger Deakins (cinematography) and Hailee Steinfeld (supporting actress) were particularly unlucky to lose.

I'm generally not in favor of watching remakes, or Westerns, but this one is worth it. The Coens don't make bad films. The acting is superb and there's just the right balance between action, drama and humor.

The story is narrated and told from the viewpoint of Mattie Ross (Steinfeld), a 14-year-old girl who wants to hire someone to catch the man who killed her father. After hearing the qualities of the potential candidates, she approaches Rooster Cogburn (Bridges). He's a one-eyed drunk with a reputation for getting the job done. Perhaps she wanted someone with the same strength of character as her own?

One of the best scenes in the movie comes early. Mattie argues with a horse trader, wanting compensation for a horse of her father's stolen while under the trader's care, as well as a refund for four ponies her father bought. This is where we see that Mattie, although young, is intelligent and capable of looking after her interests. The trader meets most of her demands and is relieved to see her leave.

Cogburn's character is revealed when he gives evidence in court. It's clear that he'll kill if necessary, and that he thinks it's often necessary. After another negotiation, Mattie secures his services to search for Tom Chaney (Brolin), her father's killer.

The other main character is LaBoeuf (Damon), a Texas Ranger who has been tracking Chaney for another crime. He wants to team up with Cogburn as both have the same goal, but they are unable to convince Mattie to stay behind and the trio end up together.

The dialogue doesn't follow that of traditional Westerns. The characters are generally well-spoken and intelligent and don't use contractions. This has the effect of making the dialogue sound formal and more important. Some of the accents are thick, but you'll soon get used to it.

After an argument with Cogburn, LaBoeuf departs and leaves Cogburn and Mattie to fend for themselves. They look for shelter and find a shack occupied by two men. Cogburn finds out some valuable information to aid the search and learns that Chaney has joined a gang which is due to arrive at the shack. Cogburn and Mattie hide and wait for them to show up.

LaBoeuf later rejoins the pair and the main action occurs when the trio meets the gang. Mattie proves her worth and both Cogburn and LaBoeuf have important parts to play in the conflict. Cogburn is not always drunk and proves very capable when the situation calls for it.

While not as quirky as other Coen films, True Grit contains plenty of humor. The dialogue is fast and the wits of the main characters are sharp. Each has some memorable lines. There isn't a huge amount of action. It's more about the setup and the dynamic between the trio. We see more of the journey than the eventual confrontation. It has the effect of making the story well-rounded and there's enough background information for us to feel like we know the characters by the end of the movie.

The conclusion jumps forward 25 years and we are shown what happens to the characters. It's a good way to end the story.

Video Quality 5/5
The Texas and New Mexico locations look stunning in this presentation and colors are bright and well-defined. Fine detail is exceptional and you can clearly pick out patterns in the dirt and see individual pieces of straw. Grain is barely visible in the majority of scenes, but there's no loss of detail. Paramount has delivered a wonderful transfer and I can't think of a better-looking live action movie.

Audio Quality 5/5
The DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track also shines. Whether it's horses galloping, insects, wind or gunfire, everything sounds the way it should. What really impresses me is the depth of sound in quieter scenes. There is so much detail. The excellent dialogue is well-defined and there's nothing to fault in the audio presentation.

There should be an Oscar for best Blu-ray presentation. True Grit would certainly be nominated. If you're a fan of the film, you'll be delighted with the whole package. The crew researched the time period thoroughly and the result feels authentic. I would recommend this even if you're not a fan of the genre.

4202026,5,B003UESJME,"I thought that this was a great movie, in my opinion the acting is exactly what I would expect and the movie does not stray from the Book too much, thats right the book, it was written a long time before the original True Grit with John Wayne (which is another great movie) came out.

Many people complain that they can't understand Jeff Bridges when he speaks, but what they might not understand is that his slurred speech is what makes it so real, for someone who has read the book that is exactly how he comes off.

The girl played the part well, for the people who say that she's to annoying and snotty, read the book, that is exactly what she is supposed to be like, a little stuck up and bratty.

In my opinion Matt Damon did a great Job of playing the over confident and proud ranger, or at least he did a heck of a lot better than Glen Campbell. Matt Damon portrays the ranger with that swagger that you would have to expect from him.

The movie itself has a who different feel than the original, which is a good thing in my opinion, I would call this more of a revamping than a remake, since a remake would just mirror everything. The filmmakers brought in their own style of lighting and sound, and varied from the book slightly, and only to add a little bit of humor or moments to help develop the characters more, in all a good movie.

My recommendation is if you enjoy the book go ahead and get the movie, but if you are dead set on the assumption that nothing can even come close to the John Wayne version then you will be disappointed because the acting and overall style of the movie is different.",1307059200,,1613,4.241042345276873

My friend that went with me agreed. I saw the original on a week or so after seeing this one and thought I would compare. My wife who has not saw the new one was going to watch it with me to compare it to the new one. Well she made it about 20 minutes into it and left the room. I watched almost 40 minutes of it and changed the channel. The whole original cast pales up next to the new. John Wayne I have never much been a fan of but thought I would try. Alot of the exact same lines are in both movies but the new one has added and changed scenes to spice it up. I thought the original was dull. Give this one a look.,1306368000,4,783,3.7515151515151515

4202030,4,B003UESJME,"The first time I saw a preview for this movie on television...I believe my eyes were actually closed and I only had to hear the first few lines that were spoken to recognize what movie this was for.  I am an avid John Wayne fan and I was absolutely horrified that anyone would even attempt to remake this movie.  This, the ONE film for which he won an Oscar (granted, it was more of a lifetime achievement award than for his performance in True Grit but still...).  To me, it was sacrelige.  I started stuttering exclamations like ""NO!"" and ""They didn't!"" and my husband asked me what was wrong.  I had to rewind the DVR and show him. He was not nearly as upset as I was but he was surpised, as well.  I was relieved, however, to see that they had at least chosen a decent actor to play Rooster Cogburn and that the supporting cast was also on par.  As I got used to the idea, I became willing to watch this movie with an open mind and my husband really wanted to see it, so we watched it.

It turns out, I enjoyed this movie.  Jeff Bridges was excellent as Rooster Cogburn.  He was difficult to understand at times, which does suit the character, HOWEVER, I feel that part of an actor's job is to deliver lines so that his audience can understand them. That was my only problem with his portrayal and I feel that it did not take that much away from the film.  I do have to say, though, that Rooster's line ""Fill your hands, you son of a %!^*#!"" sort of fell a little flat when Bridges said it.

Hailee Steinfeld completely blew Kim Darby out of the water, in my book.  She was AMAZING and played off Bridges so well.  Matt Damon, Josh Brolin, and Barry Pepper were all great.  The costumes, settings, everything seemed accurate for the period and fit the tone of the story.  Everything was well done in this film and would even watch it again.",1305849600,4,1844,4.270893371757925

4202045,4,B003UESJME,"Now please keep in mind that this is coming from someone who has NOT seen the original, so understand the vein with which I was viewing (and am now reviewing) this film.

`True Grit' tells the story of fourteen-year-old Mattie Ross.  Mattie's father was murdered by a dim-witted coward who gambled away his money and got heated in a drunken stupor, so he took the life of a man who was only trying to help him.  Mattie, an oddly matured young woman, seeks revenge for the unwarranted death of her father by seeking out a man with `true grit', someone who can hunt down the savage responsible for her newfound burdens and bring him to justice.  The man she finds is alcoholic Rooster Cogburn.  Feeling that Mattie is nothing more than a nuisance, he accepts (begrudgingly) her request and her money and then sets off with a Texas Ranger who is also in pursuit of Mr. Ross's killer, albeit for different reasons.  Mattie, determined to see this through, forces Cogburn to take her along, and soon she sets off for a life changing adventure that proves to be far more than she expected.

Besides the fact that I haven't seen the original, I have been pretty clear on this site that I'm not really all that into Westerns as a genre.  That said; there have been quite a few modern Western submissions that have delighted me, and the last time the Coen Brothers attacked this genre, they scored pretty high (despite the fact that I find it marginally overrated, there is no denying that `No Country for Old Men' is a very good film).

I was excited about this.

As a film, `True Grit' works very well.  The acting is decent to great (with a small exception), the pacing is superb and the `grit' is well executed.  The violence is savage yet never overbearing.  The authenticity is captured in every frame, with a thick film of dust encapsulating each scene.  The dialog, while at times a tad overwrought, is one of the film's best assets, taking a classic story to another level by adding some depth and maturity.

All in all, `True Grit' is a very good film.

That said; there is a spark missing for me that I really wanted to be there.  When all was said and done I liked the film but didn't LOVE it like I expected.  Some of the film's themes seemed a tad redundant and the ending was a disappointment (not the `story' ending but the throwaway ending with the elder Mattie).  It was just a notch below what I thought it could have been.  Still, there is a lot about this film to love.  Matt Damon, for one, is superb.  While some of his dialog, especially his sarcasm, is overused, he sells it hard.  While I found Bridges to be phoning it in a bit, he was quite effective (the man can do anything) and Hailee Steinfeld was arguably sensational (she seemed a bit too rehearsed in scenes, but overall she was excellent).  In fact, the only actorly sore spot was Josh Brolin who just played the simpleton too clichd.

With sharp editing and directing and a superbly grounded pacing (the action falls in all the right places to pave the way for a keenly developed character study), `True Grit' is a film that lives up to its name and reputation.  It is gritty and engaging and totally invested.  It isn't perfect but it does enough `right' to validate the praise.",1304985600,2,3257,4.494897959183674

4202049,4,B003UESJME,"True Grit (2010) is a much better movie than the original 1969 John Wayne movie for quite a few reasons:

1.) The Mattie Ross character in the original movie (played by Kim Darby) was such an annoying, dumb, and cowardly woman that I was hoping that The Duke would shoot her too. She was acting too much like a spoiled baby-boomer than a female living in the late 1800s. The new Mattie Ross character is a very calm, intelligent, and brave woman. In fact, her 14 year-old character is even more intelligent than college-educated women in the 21st century. It's nice to see females back when they were smart and brave without being masculine.

2.) The LaBeef character in the original movie (played by country / pop singer Glen Campbell) was dull as dishwater. That's because Glen Campbell should have stuck to singing his country-pop crossover hits like ""Wichita Lineman"" and ""Galveston"" instead of trying to act. He's a singer, not an actor and his poor acting proves this. The new LaBeef character is played by Matt Damon (an actual actor) and this gives the Texas Ranger character something it was missing before....character depth and a convincing performance.

3.) The Rooster Cogburn character in the original movie (played by John Wayne) was too comical to be convincing as a U.S. Marshal. It reminded me of his performance in the awful western-comedy ""McLintock."" The award John Wayne won for this movie was strictly a sympathy award. Nobody played a tough movie cowboy better than The Duke but nobody played a comedic cowboy clown worse than The Duke and, sad to say, The Duke playe one in ""True Grit"" and ""McLintock."" The new Rooster Cogburn character (played by Jeff Bridges) is a U.S. Marshal whose humor is subtle and not clownish; who has a toubled past not explored in the original film; and the voice of a grizzled, hard-nosed, hard-drinking older man instead of the famous slurred voice of John Wayne who talked the same way in every movie.

4.) The plot is closer to the novel than the original movie and that matters here because it's a good plot. Not even a fair plot but a good plot of revenge.

All in all: Bridges' grit is true...Wayne's grit is false to the point of being comical.

However, True Grit (1969) has some better qualities than the re-make.

1.) Robert Duvall's Ned Pepper in the original is a far more menacing villain than Barry Pepper's Ned Pepper. Also, Robert Duvall is one of the greatest actors of all-time. No actor after Duvall's generation even comes close to portraying such brilliance on-screen [can you imagine Tom Hanks playing a fierce villain? And no, ""Road to Perdition"" doesn't count...he was as menacing in that as he was in Bosom Buddies, Big, and all those other goofy movies he makes].

I think the casting director chose Barry Pepper to play Ned Pepper just because their last names are the same. I can imagine what the casting director thought to himself when he came up with that idea: ""Pepper playing Pepper! Oh, The Irony!""

2.) There is no Strother Martin in the re-make. I know it was impossible to have him reprise his role as the Colonel whom Maggie Ross bargains with because he's been dead since 1980 but that doesn't matter. The Colonel in this movie tries too hard to have a Strother Martin accent and it comes off as an obviously bogus voice. They should have had the actor playing the Colonel speak in his normal voice or have Strother Martin's voice dubbed-in with the new Colonel's dialogue. Heck, the actor could have imitated John Wayne's voice as a subtle tribute. No western character was like the late great Strother Martin and anyone who tries to mimmick him is only embarrassing himself.

3.) Josh Brolin's Chaney isn't as effective as the original Chaney but the Coen Brothers probably chose him because he was in their last big hit ""No Country For Old Men."" It's basically a sympathy role. Personally, I would have preferred Billy Bob Thornton with a dark moustache as Chaney. Thinking of Josh Brolin riding that little bike in ""The Goonies"" makes it impossible for me to consider him a serious, let alone menacing, actor.

4.) The famous dialogue between Ned Pepper and Rooster seemed much more appropriate in the original. If you forget the dialogue, it goes something like this:

Pepper: That's just talk from an old, one-eyed fat man.
Rooster: Fill your hands you son of a gun!

When this part is in the remake, it seems too forced and out-of-place. It's as if the Coen Brothers said ""we HAVE TO put those lines in the movie! We just HAVE TO!""
After all, John Wayne was FAT and Jeff Bridges isn't that fat at all in this movie so the lines in the original are more effective and insulting.

Bottom Line: True Grit (2010) is much better than the original [which was one of Wayne's worst westerns], and it's a good adaptation of a good novel about the fascinating subject of vengeance.",1303948800,3,4871,4.7018779342723
4202050,4,B003UESJME,"In a near-perfect adaption of Charles Portis' novel, the Coen brothers revitalize the John Wayne film, garnering

Also, the song which commences the credits is awful. But that aside, it's a great movie. The acting is marvelous,

the violence appropriate for the setting, as well as not incredibly brutal as some directors tend to portray

This is surprising to me since I am, for the most part, a proponent of original versions and believe that some films are above remakes.  But this one is an exception to the rule, I guess.  The best part of this remake is the young lady playing the lead role of Mattie Ross.  She practically stole the show with her rendition of this character.  She definitely held her own opposite veteran co-stars Matt Damon and Jeff Bridges.  Not bad for a rookie.  The remake is darker and less comical in appearance than the John Wayne version.  The acting is much more believable as well.

4202077,5,B003UESJME,"The real star in this movie is clearly Haliee Steinfield. The characters portrayed are exaggerated and unrealistic, bordering on unbelievable and cartoon-ish. This adds to the enjoyment of the film. Haliee as Mattie has developed a level of knowledge and maturity that most people don't achieve in a lifetime, let alone in 14 years. There are certain characteristics of background people that make things interesting. For instance the undertaker tells Mattie on two separate occasions that it is okay for her to kiss a corpse, then later tells her it is okay if she wants to sleep in the coffin. Is the undertaker a borderline necrophiliac? The Texas Ranger LaBoeuf talks about kissing Mattie, then later spanks her. Is he boarding on pedophilia? Then there is the grandmother who snores. There is the traveling doctor wearing a bear's skin, including the head. He practices taking teeth out of dead people. It is these details that makes the movie interesting and quirky.

Rooster Cogburn, the man Mattie hires to pursue her father's killer, proudly served with the infamous William Quantrill, a group of Confederate raiders which history has portrayed in a negative light. Mattie is obsessed with revenge, but not to the point where it consumes her so she can not think.

The humor is dry:

Mattie: Why were they pursuing you?
Rooster: I robbed a high interest bank.
Mattie: That is stealing.
Rooster: Umm. That is the position they took in New Mexico.",1302998400,,1454,4.9753086419753085

The first film with John Wayne was a mediocre average western only saved by the presence of a 14 year old girl chasing and hunting the killer of her father. The Coen brothers performed a miracle and give this film a strength and power it did not have in 1969. After spaghetti westerns now is the time of kaddish westerns.

They more or less try to be a lot more effective as for the feelings and emotions of the audience. They use the girl at her maximum in all situations. The story though is simplistic but it provides us with some beautiful pictures and landscapes and it increases the dramatic tension a lot.

But that does not make a great film and not even a beautiful film, except the touristic discovery of the Santa Fe region and its wilderness. The ending is different and it adds some posthumous depth to the story but fundamentally we are very far away and even more than far away from the tension of Sergio Leones' and Ennio Morricones' films.

Yet it is pleasant and I must say the hanging scene is a lot more impressive in this version probably due to the nice sound track that makes the breaking of the vertebrae a lot more audible. But let me give you a final piece of advice: do not spend the night with the local granny.

Hailee Steinfeld was NEVER convincing as this young vengeful girl and most times it seemed she was just reading her lines instead of acting. Such a sham to have even considered her for an academy award. What is the matter with Hollywood? Then to add insult to injury, the marble-mouthed Jeff Bridges gets nominated, too. Yikes. His performance was unintelligable. I could not understand half the things he said. Matt Damon was unconvincing also and what was with his speech?  Did the Coen's have some researcher find out that all the people in the Old West were going around with some sort of speech impediment? I love the fact that Josh Brolin got third billing when he was in the movie for, what, ten minutes max!!! Unbelievable!

The only saving grace was the cinematography which was great, but the rest of the film was SO BAD that they wasted the talent of Roger Deakins in a waste of a movie.

I recommend that you pass on this movie, but if you are really bent on seeing this disaster, rent it, sleep through it and then return it!",1299628800,19,1244,4.419213973799127
4202084,4,B003UESJME,"After viewing this revisionist remake of the John Wayne Western twice, I'd have to say that this is an improvement over the the 1968 film. One factor is the marvelously scene stealing performance of 14 yr old Hailee Steinfeld over Kim Darby's performance (she was 24 and married with child at the time)plus Matt Damon's La Boeuf is big improvement over the wooden Glen Campbell's take.  As for Jeff Bridges' take on Rooster, I found it hard at first to understand him but was gradually won over because his performance was much more subtle and understated than the over-blown performance Wayne gave to the role. And also, the Coen's managed to remain truer to the book and capture the humor of it as well.  If you love Westerns (this made over a 100 million at the b.o.) or the Coen brothers--then you'll like this oater.",1299456000,2,821,4.655172413793103
4202105,5,B003UESJME,"After four viewings at the cinema i thought i'd better pick up the dvd :) Hailee Steinfeld was fantastic in this and really i want to say that she was beautiful- not in any pervy sense - and at the risk of sounding like a nutter - her acted out character was beautiful. She absolutely owns everyone in the movie in terms of dialogue and it is a joy to listen and watch. Matt Damon's view of her: ""You Give Out Very Little Sugar With Your Pronouncements"" just about sums it up for me - in fact the initial conversation between those two is pure cinema gold. The subtle humour in this film is constant - i just haven't got the vocabulary to say how much i appreciate it. It is mainly in the dialogue but it is there in other ways too such as the emergence of the bear doctor, meeting Jeff Bridges on the john (again) and the bed sharing scenes with grandma. The casting in this movie was flat out perfect. Initially, on the first viewing i had slight doubts about Bridges but once i got used to the accent by the second viewing i thought he was great too. Apart from Steinfeld who stole the show, Matt Damon in particular deserves special praise. He was a revelation here for me - i would say his understated performance played off the other characters well.

The use of music was just right - i loved the way the hymns and tunes were integrated and there was a certain natural crackle once they got out on the trail too. - some lovely quiet night scenes. I really don't think i've seen such a beautifully shot film before. The cinematographer really hit it out the park and then some to spare. Again i just want to say every frame was special to me. gorgeous without exageration. The editing, camera angles and lighting and the sheer natural beauty on display was special throughout.

im a big Coens fan although i wish they would calm down overall with the amount of violence and profanity. True Grit was therefore much more agreeable to me and the violence was less of a focus here although very much part of the story. Without the slightest shadow of doubt this is my favourite film from them and i've seen them all. It is a bar raising movie in their ouvre - there was a certain economy on display - nothing wasted - every scene counted and every scene had a certain photographic beauty to it as well as their trademark dialogue and subtle observations.",1299369600,4,2356,4.376712328767123
4202106,4,B003UESJME,"I have to admit, I don't have the original to compare it to. Given that, let me make a potentially blasphemous suggestion: this might be a good remake, maybe very good. I know that a good story really can't be copied, but even good tellings show their age. The story needs to be told again, in the words of a new generation, to remain fresh and vital.

Back then people could tolerate a heroic man with a few flaws. Today, we can only believe in a flawed man with - maybe - a little heroism. And not just man, but woman, a very young woman, only 14 but still a force to be reckoned with. I've seen the level at which teenagers can perform in art, science, music, math, and impulsiveness. I am well disposed to believe in young Mattie's mix of intelligence, belligerence, visceral motivation, and remnant of little girl who wants a campfire story.

If bloodshed suits you poorly, then this isn't a movie for you. It normally doesn't bother me much, but seeing it all around the barely-teen girl didn't work well for me. That's the only loss of innocence, though. It maintains a chaste tone throughout - even if one might have wished the adult Mattie a bit less chastity. Although I've liked Matt Damon in many other flicks, he didn't get a real chance to shine here. This movie really centers on Rooster and especially Mattie, and those two carry the movie beautifully, even for someone who thinks they don't like Westerns. Somewhat to my surprise, I enjoyed this one a lot.

4202107,2,B003UESJME,"I grew up on Western movies, and was pretty interested to see what this remake could deliver.  Unfortunately, it didn't deliver much of anything.  There was a huge lack of direction for one thing.  It's like the Coens just told everyone to just go out and read their lines any old which way and it would be fine.  As a result, the minor parts that are critical to the story were horribly played; in fact several of them were worst acting I have ever seen.  There was little consideration given to the audience, with many characters slurring speech which was distracting to the story.  There were quite a few scenes that looked as if they had been rushed through and should have been re-shot.  Some of them didn't even make any sense and could have been cut entirely as they contributed nothing to the movie.

Hailee Steinfeld did well in her part as Mattie Ross, but several scenes should have been reworked.  She actually blew her lines in a couple but they left them in anyway, giving me the impression that they were in a hurry to get the movie shot.

Jeff Bridges portrayal of Rooster Cogburn was mixed.  Some good, some bad.  Again, speaks to poor direction.

Matt Damon looks better in the previews than he did in the movie.  His performance was pretty forgettable.

Josn Brolin's Tom Chaney was, again, forgettable.

Other than Steinfeld, Barry Peppers performance as Ned Pepper was nothing short of outsdanding; unfortunately, his surrounding characters were pathetically acted out.

This was the first movie I have gone to in years that I considered walking out of halfway through.  There are parts of it that are literally that boring, dispassionate, and nonsensical; many scenes shot in too much of a hurry; and others that should have been left out.  The Western directors and actors of yesteryear are a pretty hard act to follow, and True Grit 2010 didn't make it.  I gave it two stars for Steinfeld (a pretty stellar performance given her inexperience and the fact she was getting no help on set) and Pepper.",1299110400,8,2022,4.706552706552706
4202108,4,B003UESJME,"As a True Grit fanatic, (PLEASE READ THIS).....and reviewing both.
This is my OFFICAL REVIEW:
1st the Coen brothers preped the actors to say "" this is NOT a remake"" . YES IT IS !
They also said it is true to the book. Some of that is true, some not.
Such as...YES it is told from a point of ""Mattie"" and the wrap up at the end is good.
But the dugout scene was not.  The book said all 3 were there. The separation,  TWICE  in the
Coen screenplay worked.........BUT was not believable,  nor was in the book.
And what was the crap about the hanged man, and the ""bear man "". ??
But on the flip side, McAlister's, had a part in the 1969  screenplay, was not mentioned in the book.
LaBeouf should have never died in the 1969 movie, 2010 version worked better, in  the
entire snake pit scene.

A  book does not need to be the GOLD STD., but the COENS did market  that way
and it was NOT TRUE . I like their work, and admire them , BUT don't sell  it false.
What is a screenplay anyway..it is an adaption of the book. Don't say what is not true,
If it is NOT Mr. Coen!
The way movies were made in the 60s is different than now.
Atmospheric  cinematography has changed.  The 1969 movie is not as good as
the new one. The music is also different...... Elmer Bernstein is a genesis  with
emotion and grandeur.  Music  now is less noticeable, but still effective
I still get chills when John Wayne cocks his rile in the meadow. . My vote goes to
Elmer.
Acting: Every since 1969, I have always said Glen Campbell did a bad job. And for the most part
I still believe that. At times, Glen did ok, but his lack of experience showed. Wayne is Wayne.
If you like him, a YES,  if you are ... so on Wayne, say so. Then Bridges is your man, and he did a
great job ! And Damon did do a better job than Glen.
Mattie:  Kim did a good job, but Hallie was a better cast, and did a very good job.
As much as  I love and admire Robert Duvall,  Barry Pepper, and the Coens ( make up, etc..)
did a better job.
The main issues I have with the 2 movies is this: When I 1st say the Coen screenplay it worked BUT
when seeing. the 1969 screenplay, by Marguerite Roberts it flowed MUCH better. The Coens
Screenplay was choppy, not a well flowing story, Except for the post meadow scene.

In summary,  (and in short)  if I could Remake  True Grit, I would cast Bridges, Damon and Steinfield, and Pepper  and the fabulous  Strother Martin (1969)........the best better horse trader !!
 I would use the back drop of the San Juan mountains, FABULOUS!  The cinematography of 2011,
 ( atmosphere, lighting, etc.)..MUSIC:  BOTH, and  the Screen Play......... redone to incorporate Both........True to book !

all for now.

4202109,5,B003UESJME,"I was excited about this movie as soon as I heard that the Coen brothers and Jeff Bridges were involved.  The comic effect of the heightened vocabulary of Portis' novel fits right in with the Coen's aesthetic, most notably Raising Arizona and O Brother Where Art Thou, but it's also present in many of their other films as well. Like an O Henry story, the Coen's characters often speak more eloquently than their educational or societal level would seem to support.

Jeff Bridges is great as usual and Hailee Steinfeld is amazing as Mattie. Matt Damon is  hilarious as the blowhard Texas Ranger who imagines his quarry, Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), to be a criminal genius when he's basically just a vicious idiot.

Like pretty much every other Coen's movie, I'll be picking this up as soon as it comes out and giving it repeated viewings.

4202113,4,B003UESJME,"Joel and Ethan Coen (No Country for Old Men, Fargo) have extended their filmmaking prowess into new territory by adapting Charles Portis' famous novel, True Grit, and their interpretation is a refreshing take on the western genre and compares favorably to the memorable John Wayne starring version of 1969.  Purists who thought it would be sacrilege to remake a western classic have little to fear.  Thanks to a smart script and strong acting, True Grit comes off as a very solid film with some similarities and noticeable differences from the original film.

Told in flashback by a woman's voice, a 14 year old Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) wants to avenge the murder of her father at the hands of Tom Chaney (a grizzled Josh Brolin), and she arrives in a small town to hire Marshal Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), an aged, hard drinking veteran lawman who has done his share of killing and more.  Mattie is not one to be trifled with and as another pursuer, Texas Ranger LaBoeuf (Matt Damon), realizes, not one to intimidate.  Headstrong, she has grit herself.  Together the trio search for Chaney and seek out a lead in another outlaw, Ned Pepper (an unrecognizable Barry Pepper).  As friction mounts among the searchers, LeBoeuf strikes out on his own, and Cogburn and Mattie come upon a cabin. There, a couple of outlaws are smoked out, and this leads to Ned Pepper and his gang. Can Chaney be far behind?  It all culminates in a final confrontation between Cogburn and Ned Pepper as Mattie comes face to face with her quarry and LeBoeuf reenters the scene with violent results.

Bridges (Crazy Hearts) is utterly convincing in making this version of Rooster Cogburn his own persona.  He portrays him as a proud, grumpy curmudgeon who just may be a crack shot and smarter than he lets on.  This takes nothing away from the over the top performance of John Wayne who won an Oscar for his rendition.  You could almost see Tommy Lee Jones in this role.  We gets bits and pieces of Cogburn's past, and some of the tales make you wonder if they are utter fabrications or sheer exaggeration.  Steinfeld is a marvel in her first movie role.  She embodies Mattie as a take charge gal who will not be deterred and has enough smarts and spunk to strike a hard bargain with any man.  Witness her amusing negotiations with a horse trader and wearing him down.  Damon (Good Will Hunting) does well in a supporting role and adds more nuance than Glen Campbell's version of LaBoeuf did in the older version.  Brolin and Pepper have what amount to small but memorable screen time as the bad guys.

The dynamics of the trio are interestingly portrayed as LeBoeuf and Cogburn face off and trade barbs, while Mattie asserts herself every chance she gets.  You even think there might be a hint of attraction between Mattie and LeBoeuf.  The arc of LeBoeuf's character deviates from the 1969 film significantly especially at the climax.  The only negative is that his fate is left open ended and unresolved.

Much of the film is superior to the older version.  There is really only one scene that would suffer in comparison to the original film, and that is the climactic charge by Cogburn against the bad guys.  Bridges does well but he is not John Wayne.  The scene lacks the heroic, mythic feel of Wayne.  Also, when Bridges is shown in closeup carrying Mattie to safety, it seems a bit phony.  But those are minor observations.  A final sequence shows what happens many years afterward and serves as a melancholy postscript, and it has a final feel of a film like Unforgiven.  The film could easily work without it though.

Thanks to the Coens, the authentic sounding dialogue, which is laced with humorous moments including a shooting contest between Cogburn and LeBoeuf, is peppy and sharp, a marked improvement from standard western fare.  There are times when Bridges' drawling and inflections are hard to understand but you get the gist anyway through context and body language.  Technical crafts are standout especially a good musical score by Carter Burwell and beautiful cinematography by veteran Roger Deakins (A Beautiful Mind).

The Coen brothers must have been drawn to the quirky characters and the language of the novel, and while this is certainly not their best film, it is a very entertaining western with some standout performances.",1298592000,3,4339,4.7954239569313595

A 14-year-old girl finds her father murdered by a man he trusted. After claiming the body for 60 dollars, she steps up and determines that she has to become the insturment of justice or her father will have none. In doing so, she teams up with a marshall, a ranger, and sets out into the unknown.

When True Grit came out, I had high hopes for it. The directors clout alone says that this should eb a grea tmovie, and I really was not disappointed. The one thing I was surprised by was the fact that I laughed quite a bit while watching it, and I found myself not being bored. It had great narration, great dialog, and great acting moving that one thing forward. If it had not been that way, I wonder what would have been - thankfully I did not have to ponder that in the really real.

The acting in this movie shines, and it makes you really think about how good some of these people can be. Jeff Bridges was the standout amongst everyone, with his portrayal of a man that had grown drunk and cocky and fatter with time, but was still full of fire and grit. The same can be said of the girl that hires him, with her not only presenting a formitable front but also doing great narration. Matt Damon was good but he seemed a little stale in some places, but even that worked in favor of the man standing in that Ranger's badge.

The plot itself was easy to follow, but some things happen that you might not expect. I enjoyed that, too, and I liked the fact that the ending was not predictable. Like many Coen movies, I thought I might know the ending but I wasn't sure. I did think one thing, however, and that was that there was a link in the types of endings they had been presenting. Perhaps that says something on them or their views or just what they like. Whatever it is, I find I like it as well.

The effects are nice, too, and it has some violent portions. It really does not have to have these and does not rely on them, sticking to dialogue more than anything. this earns it an easy 4.0/5 stars in my book, and is easily worth watching.

4202137,3,B003UESJME,"***1/2

The Coen Brothers' remake of ""True Grit"" is drier, darker and considerably less ebullient than the 1969 original that won John Wayne his Oscar. Well, it's definitely ""grittier.""

The Charles Portis novel on which both movies are based centers on Mattie Ross, a spunky, wise-beyond-her-years 14-year-old who hires the aging, drunken, one-eyed fat man, Marshall Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), to help her hunt down and capture the hired hand who murdered her father in cold blood. The two are joined in their endeavor by LaBoeuf, a Texas ranger (Matt Damon  replacing Glen Campbell) who has reasons of his own for wanting to see Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin) brought to justice.

The real charm of ""True Grit"" has always lain in several unique elements: the incongruity between the idealistic, inexperienced and indefatigable Mattie and the cynical brutality of the Old West setting; the quaintly amusing way in which the characters speak without the use of contractions; and the larger-than-life figure of Cogburn himself. In their stab at the material, the Coen Brothers get most of those elements right, though the movie may be a bit more emotionally detached, dawdling and long-winded than it needs to be at times. And although Bridges brings a great deal of humor and bluff to his interpretation of Cogburn, in his single-minded attempt to avoid simply duplicating Wayne's signature performance, he seems to have come dangerously close to channeling Karl from ""Sling Blade"" instead. Moreover, since much of Bridges' dialogue comes out garbled, the viewer often finds himself at a loss as to what exactly the man is saying, which makes it rather hard to follow the plot at times. Damon, who's been given some fairly impressive jowls for the occasion, has some of the same problem, though certainly not to the extent Bridges does.

The real acting triumph comes in the form of a then-thirteen-year-old bundle of energy named Hailee Stenfeld, who far surpasses what a likable, but far less talented Kim Darby was able to do with the role. It is Stenfeld, with her indomitable spirit and letter-perfect diction, who becomes the true heart and soul of the picture.

As with ""No Country for Old Men,"" the Coens once again demonstrate their eye for detail and their mastery of long-shot composition, brought to vivid life by the crystalline cinematography of Roger Deakins.  For ""True Grit"" is never anything less than gorgeous to look at.

Perhaps it's pointless even to compare this version with the one from forty-plus years ago, since the Coen Brothers have gone out of their way to make it clear that they are not attempting a remake with their film. But one side-by-side scene analysis may be of some value here anyway. It is clearly the most familiar and fondly remembered moment from the earlier film, the one in which an aging, scowling, greatly outnumbered Wayne, all bulked-up and astride his horse, throws the reins into his mouth and, with a rifle discharging from each hand, rides straight towards the bad guys without a moment's hesitation. The reason it is such an iconic image is because it represents the visual culmination of Wayne's entire career as a movie cowboy hero. We laugh along at the audacious absurdity of the scene, yet can't help but be moved by its purity. Yet, when we see Bridges do the exact same thing, finely executed as the scene may be, it can't possibly have the same impact because we have no previous associations of Bridges to go along with it.

Perhaps in keeping with the temper of the times, this ""True Grit"" is a more sober and serious (and faithful) adaptation of the Portis novel. It's just not as much fun.",1298073600,6,3657,4.914100486223663
4202138,4,B003UESJME,"My childhood was filled with John Wayne westerns. To this day, True Grit stands as Wayne's finest hour; so it was with both curiosity and apprehension that I first heard a remake was in the works. My apprehension soon gave way to excitement when I heard about the principals: The Coen Brothers, Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon, and Josh Brolin. I was still unsure that anyone could match the presence and impact of the legendary Duke, but who better to try than the Dude? The western genre has enjoyed a brief, but critically viable, resurgence in recent years and True Grit is a welcome, if unspectacular, addition to the genre. There are very few missteps, but I can't help but feel that we just missed witnessing something that could have been truly spectacular.

For those unfamiliar with the origins of the story, True Grit is a remake/reimagining of the 1969 Henry Hathaway film of the same name, which is in turn based on the 1968 book written by Charles Portis. Hathaway's film was notable for earning John Wayne only Oscar and Wayne's performance, though a bit on the hammy side, still stands as one of the high points of a legendary career. The Coen Brothers approached the material with the intent of delivering a more faithful adaptation of the book, and on that count they succeeded quite admirably. Told from the point of view of the young Mattie Ross (fantastic newcomer Hailee Steinfeld), True Grit tells the story of a young girl, dead set on finding and killing her father's murderer. She enlists the help of a drunken US Marshall named Rooster Cogburn (Bridges, clearly having a ball) and a boisterous Texas Ranger played by a riotous Matt Damon. Together, the three set out into Indian territory; what follows is a beautifully shot and often funny, if slight, journey.

The Coen Brothers are known for their quirkiness and it is somewhat disappointing that True Grit possesses so little of this trademark oddness. Indeed, the film is likely the Coen's first straightforward genre exercise; to their credit, they set out to make a western and they made a good one. This is primarily due to the quality of their assured direction, the beautiful cinematography by longtime collaborator Roger Deakins, and the excellent performances by a star-filled cast.

Bridges plays Cogburn as a drunken mess of a man, though a man still scarily competent when it comes time for bloodshed. As he staggers about, slurring his words and rattling off stories of past adventures, it's clear that outside of Wayne, Bridges is the only actor that could possibly inhabit the role. It is an Oscar-worthy performance, although one likely to result in only a nomination, given last years' win for Crazy Heart. Damon is hilarious as the cocky Texas Ranger, La Boeuf (pronounced La Beef, and repeated numerous times to hilarious effect by Cogburn), and Josh Brolin and Barry Pepper also turn in high quality performances in limited screen time as the villains. Those four actors comprise a murderers' row of talent, but the real star of True Grit is the young Steinfeld, who goes to toe to toe with Bridges and Damon and emerges unscathed. It is a remarkable debut, and while the role is admittedly one-note, it's certainly a promising start to what looks to be a long career. The 14-year old has garnered significant Oscar buzz, and deservedly so.

The direction and acting are excellent, but where the film falters is in both pacing and tone. While it is quite funny, I couldn't help but feel that it was almost too funny, as the darkly serious subject matter didn't seem to be treated with the proper weight. And although this is no fault of the Coen Brothers, the film seemed rather slight, as there simply wasn't a lot going on. There are only three major events in the film, and the villains only appear for five minutes or so. My biggest gripe, however, was the lack of John Wayne. Again, it's hard to criticize a film for something beyond its control, but when you enter the remake game, you must accept that you will be judged against those that came before you. While Bridges version of Cogburn is certainly more believable and far funnier than the character as played by Wayne, I couldn't help but wish Wayne would take over during the scenes involving gunplay. The climactic gun battle lacks the power and ferocity of the original's finale, and it was with some disappointment that I realized that even the Coen Brothers, armed with Jeff Bridges and a host of great actors, cannot always pull an ace from their sleeves.

4202141,5,B003UESJME,"First off, this is not a remake of the 1969 Henry Hathaway film starring John Wayne.  Rather, it is the second film version of Charles Portis's great 1968 novel TRUE GRIT.  Unlike the Hathaway/Wayne version, the Coen Brothers' version is far more faithful to the novel.  As an Arkansan (although I live in Chicagoan, I remain an Arkansan through and through) I loved the novel from the first of the several times I have read it, and as a result have always loathed the John Wayne film.  Although I'm a huge fan of John Wayne's westerns with John Ford and Howard Hawks, but of his other Westerns, not so much.

The problems with the Hathaway film are extensive.  The script distorts the story to make it a star vehicle for John Wayne and to do this have to pretty much gut the character of the novel's main character, Mattie Ross.  Although in the novel Mattie tells Rooster that she wants to hire him because he was a man with ""true grit,"" the events of the novel reveal that even more than Cogburn, Mattie possesses the true grit referred to in the title.  The Coen Brothers correct the aberrations of the earlier film by restoring Mattie Ross to the heart of the film.  They also cast Hailee Steinfeld in the role, a vastly more appropriate actress than Kim Darby in the earlier film, who was far too old for the role (22 instead of 14).  Darby's Mattie is too timid, too inept, and lacking in intelligence and confidence.  She is a traditional heroine in need of a hero.  But Hailee Steinfeld's Mattie is the Mattie Ross of the novel.  It is emblematic of the two films that John Wayne won an Oscar for his performance (which he truly did not deserve - ironically he did not even get a nomination for his greatest performance as Ethan Edwards in THE SEARCHERS, but won for a second tier performance as Rooster Cogburn), but Hailee Steinfeld looks like she will win an Oscar for this second film. An additional irony is that while Jeff Bridges's performance as Rooster Cogburn is vastly better than Wayne's, he is unlikely to win a second straight Oscar.  The Academy usually awards the Best Actor award for reasons that surpass quality of performance, and Wayne won in 1969 largely because he had never won before, while Bridges is unlikely to win this year he won last year.

The other problem with the 1969 film was almost across the board weak casting.  Robert Duvall was the only strong actor other than Wayne in the film.  Glen Campbell was appalling as LaBoeuf.  The new film features a string of great actors in pretty much every role, with a huge upgrade in LaBoeuf with Matt Damon and a brilliant performance by Josh Brolin as Tom Chaney.  And while Robert Duvall has done some great work over the years, Barry Pepper was great in his small role as ""Lucky"" Ned Pepper.

The script in the new film is another huge improvement over the earlier film, as is the cinematography.  There is also a significant upgrade in location shooting.  The novel and both films start off in Fort Smith, Arkansas and proceed through parts of eastern Oklahoma.  The Henry Hathaway film was shot in the Rocky Mountains, which looks absolutely nothing like Arkansas or Oklahoma.  This film was shot in Texas and New Mexico, which while not quite like northwest Arkansas and Oklahoma, is closer than the Rocky Mountains.

By restoring the balance between Rooster and Mattie that drives the novel, the movie ceases to be a star vehicle for a lead actor and becomes instead a film that explores the relationship between two strong personalities.

In short, if you are a lover of the novel, this is the film that finally does a beautiful book justice.

It is also another great film by the Coen Brothers, who along with Martin Scorsese are the great filmmakers of their generation.  Some of their films have been less than outstanding, but they never make completely uninteresting movies.  I'd rank this up there with RAISING ARIZONA, THE BIG LEBOWSKI, and NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN as one of their greatest achievements.  I can't wait to see what they do next.",1297555200,4,4043,4.629733520336606

4202143,2,B003UESJME,"I can not see how this is a good movie.  The characters in it do not speak with contractions.  They always speak in full words, ""won't"" is ""would not"" and ""isn't"" is always ""is not"" and that is not--I did an online investigation--the way people spoke in the old West.  It makes for a painful ride, as it sticks out like a sore thumb.  Every character in the entire movie speaks in this very unconventional manner, and it detracts from the film.  Oh sure, True Grit has tons of other pitfalls--Jason Bourne miscast as a wimpy Texan with moustache like a dime store Charlie Chan, and Haille S. acting like a cardboard cutout in her first onscreen role.  Hey, just because she's a kid doesn't mean she can act. And of course, the biggest blunder, the buffoon Lebowski now playing the buffoon Rooster Cogburn. Bridges has some talent, but not enough to carry an otherwise Saturday matinee quality movie. The plot is thinner than a snakeskin coin purse, and gallops along at a meander with little or no tension (sure there was tension when the Texas ranger went to the shack and the bad guys were riding up behind him, but then we had to hear for 30 minutes how the ranger hated Rooster for shooting him when he saved his life.  I'd have been kissing the guy!).

Overacted, understoried, straight ahead western with little going for it... a cast off in comparison to other superb movies in 2010 (e.g Black Swan, The King's Speech).  A rip-snorting western this is not, it's merely a straight ahead tale of revenge with comedic moments that fall flat, and of course, the damned stilted language.  The characters in this sleeper could have used a couple lessons from Geoffrey Rush's Lionel on how to speak like a human being.

4202155,5,B003UESJME,"True Grit is an excellent film. This movie reminds of how entertaining westerns can be. It is about a young girl's deternination for justice after her father is shot and killed by a man named Tom Chaney. The film stars new comer Haliey Steinfield as Mattie Ross and Jeff Bridges as Rooster Cogburn. My favorite quote from the movie is when Mattie says to Rooster that she is looking for someone with true grit in helping her track her father's killer and avenge his death. True Grit is a phrase that describes Mattie's character in the movie. She is a determined young woman blessed with intelligence and courage. Hailey Steinfield's performance is the best I have seen from any actress this past year. The relationship between Rooster and Mattie evolve in the movie.

Mattie and Rooster are accompanied on this journey by a man named LeBeouf. He is a ranger and is played by Matt Damon. There is one particularly exciting scene where LeBeouf rescues Mattie's life in the face of danger by Tom Chaney. Steinfield has chemistry with her co stars and that is what makes the movie work for me.

The music from the movie is composed by Carter Burwell. There is a beautiful song at the end of the movie entitled Leaning On The Every Lasting Arms. This song is performed by a singer named Iris DeMent. Her voice is very moving. There is instrumental music featured in the movie derived from this tune. Burwell does a great job scoring the film. There is a scene in the movie where Mattie is stuck in a snake pit. Burwell's music in that scene makes me feel a sense of dread at the appropriate time.

The film is set in Texas with some parts in New Mexico. The Coen brothers bring out the beauty of these places in the movie. I would love to ride a horse and see this beauty in person if I could. True Grit is definitely one of the best movies of 2010.",1297123200,22,1845,4.452662721893491
4202156,5,B003UESJME,"In my mind, this is the film version to watch, not the John Wayne version.  Every element of it is outstanding.  The story is easy to follow.  A teenage girl just about to pass into young adulthood loses everyone and everything when her parents are murdered in the Old West.  She hires Rooster Cogburn, played by Jeff Bridges, to track down the murderer, played by Josh Brolin.  On the trail of the murderer, they are accompanied by Matt Damon as a Texas ranger.

All of these actors do a tremendous job but what really makes this film is the Coen Brothers attention to detail in fashioning an utterly believable Old West, somewhat along the lines of Robert Altman's groundbreaking ""McCabe and Mrs. Miller."" Also, the Coens did an entirely new script based upon the source novel.  The Coens are first rate screenwriters and it shows in this film.

As to the actors, Jeff Bridges is again outstanding.  Rather than becoming an imitation John Wayne, he sinks into what a Rooster Cogburn in the Old West might really be like and inhabits Rooster like his standard outfit and guns.  There is nothing overblown about him at all and the performance is that much more effective for being quieter. Brolin makes a great villain as usual.  This is becoming a sideline of his which he is excellent at creating.  I first marveled at his villainy while he was playing Dan White in the Harvey Milk film.  Matt Damon, as usual, is almost unrecognizable as he becomes the initially obnoxious Texas Ranger.

4202157,5,B003UESJME,"""I call that bold talk for a one-eyed fat man!""

- a much darker grittier True Grit! If that original was fine grit sandpaper, this is coarse! Retreads are seldom as good as the originals and John Wayne's Rooster Cogburn won an Oscar. But the Coen Brother's succeed: Jeff Bridge's drunken swaggering Cogburn is every bit as good as John Wayne,  Matt Damon's  dandified Texas Ranger LaBoefe is far superior to the dreadfully bland Glen Campbell and Hailee Steinfeld's Mattie Ross is much younger, more nave and much tougher than Kim Darby, with a much sharper tongue.

The real joy in this movie is the 19th century flowery speech and language which is probably authentic, based on period and Civil War books I've read. The language and put-downs show what American English once was (and how far it's been dumbed-down today to accommodate the stupid).

I understand this version is far closer to the book, which I have not read. The original was OK for the 60's, but this is, well, sinister, dangerous, grittier, as I said and probably more the way people really acted in the 1880's.

This may be the finest movie the Coen brothers have ever done, more detailed, more dirt, more bad teeth, more slime, more reality.",1296777600,12,1214,4.729857819905213
4202158,5,B003UESJME,"Yes there are some remakes that do work and the Coen Brother's True Grit is one of them. John Wayne may always be the definitive Rooster Cogburn to most people, but Jeff Bridges has turned in an Oscar nominated performance that does nothing but compliment and enhance the character. I am so glad that they followed the book more faithfully, rather than just simply remake the original film. The supporting cast is also excellent and in my opinion, with the except of Robert Duvall as Lucky Ned Pepper (in the 1969 film), even better than that of the original movie. Kim Darby was really too old to play the 14 year old Mattie Ross and Glen Campbell was never much of an actor. Matt Damon is a vast improvement as LeBeouf and certainly Josh Brolin proves a much more menacing Tom Chaney than Jeff Corey was. I can't wait for this DVD. I hope it is full of extras.",1296691200,7,862,4.427672955974843
4202159,5,B003UESJME,"Although I missed the 1969 version of True Grit in the theater (due to boycotting John Wayne over his very public political stance on the Vietnam War) the movie is a perennial favorite. I was prepared not to like the new version but thought I would give it a chance. And, I must say that the Coen Brother's version of the movie did not disappoint. I actually liked this movie better than the 1969 version, though both have their strong points and weak points.

The 2010 movie is, first of all, not a remake of the 1969 movie, in fact, there is no comparison between the two. The strong points of the new version is that it is much more faithful to the original novel than the 1969 film. In fact, most of the dialog is taken right out of the novel. The 2011 movie also avoids the 1969 movie's two dreadful casting errors (the first being Glen Campbell - as an actor he is a fine singer. He should have stuck to his trade - and the second mistake was casting a 22-year old Kim Darby as a 14-year old girl). Mat Damon made an excellent LaBoef, though his role is cut down significantly from the novel and the movie. And Hailee Steinfeld is wonderful (and age appropriate) in the role of Mattie Ross.

The strong points of the 1969 movie version was, of course, John Wayne, and also the wonderful cast of character actors filling the roles of Colonel Stonehill, Tom Chaney and Lucky Ned Pepper. Their performances were so iconic I doubted anybody else could fill their shoes. John Wayne was always under-rated by the critics (undeservedly so) as a comedic actor and he shines as Rooster Cogburn and plays him as a parody of the iconic movie image he had built his career upon.

The actors in the 2010 version did not attempt to imitate these classic performances, for which I am profoundly grateful. The new actors made the roles their own. Jeff Bridges is not the Rooster we grew up watching, but his performance is a lot closer to the Rooster Cogburn in the novel. Who KNEW that Jeff Bridges could actually ACT? Miss Steinfeld played the role of Mattie ""right down to the ground"" - as a sassy, abrasive, know-it-all young teenager and not with the fake wide-eyed wonderment that Kim Darby brought to the role (I was never quite sure if this was acting on Miss Darby's part or if she was just in awe at being in a movie with John Wayne).

The music in the new film is beautiful (though some of the hymns the sound track is based on were from the late 1880s and not the late 1860s, during which period the movie was set) and Iris McDemit's ""Leaning on the Everlasting Arms"" is beautiful and haunting. The Texas scenery is much more appropriate to Arkansas than the Colorado scenery the 1969 movie was shot in. Sorry, folks, but there just ain't any part of Arkansas that looks like the Rockies.

That said, the new movie is not a perfect film. First, it's significantly shorter than the original, and some vital scenes are missing. The most glaring omission was the whole first chapter of the novel, where, in the 1969 film, we see Frank Ross and family at home, before he sets out on his shopping trip to Fort Smith. I'd have much rather that this scene had been included in the film instead of the Bear Man scene, which the Coen Brothers made up out of whole cloth and isn't in the novel. Also, the journey through the Indian Territory is so fast paced it seems to only take a day or two for Rooster and Mattie to run Lucky Ned Pepper's gang to ground, instead of the weeks it seemed to take in the original film. Most of the quest for Tom Chaney is simply passed over. The ending of the new film is different, too, and though many other reviewers complained about this, the new ending is taken directly from the novel almost word for word. Evidently Henry Hathaway thought that 1969 audiences wouldn't accept such a melancholy ending and so made up a happier ending. I liked the happier ending, but the new ending is more faithful to the book.

That said, I feel I must close by taking the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to task. If the 1969 movie (and John Wayne) deserved an Oscar, then the 2010 version - which in my opinion is a better film and more faithful to the original book - also deserved a few Oscars. Jeff Bridges deserved one for his interpretation of Rooster Cogburn, as did Hailee Steinfeld. That neither won an Oscar is almost a crime (though it should be noted that the Academy routinely disrespects both Sci-Fi movies and Westerns, no matter how excellent they may be). I'd much rather watch ""True Grit"" again than some movie about a stuttering King. It's also shameful that the Academy didn't even consider Carter Burwell's soundtrack, dismissing it as ""derivative"" (Which is akin to saying that Aaron Copeland's ""Appalacian Spring"" and ""Rodeo"" aren't classical music because he reused traditional music in the score). Mr. Burwell took two or three traditional hymns and wove them into a symphony that evokes the full range of emotions, from wide-eyed wonder to abject terror and everything in between. The music from the film stands up on its own, a sure sign of a good musical score.

I am still very fond of the John Wayne version, even though it was written as a vehicle for John Wayne and thus strays far and wide from the novel. The new movie, however, is both a worth successor to the 1969 film, and also an improvement upon it. Both movies deserve space on any Western fan's movie shelf.",1296604800,16,5427,4.4979716024340775
4202160,5,B003UESJME,"When a Shakespeare play that has been made into a film previously is made again, it is not called a remake. The Coen Brother's latest film True Grit is based on a novel by Charles Portis that was made into an iconic film with an iconic lead performance in 1969, but the Coen's version is not a remake of the 1969 film but a new adaptation of the novel. I feel this way because it never feels like the 1969 version served as a reference point for the Coen's vision of the story. As I have never read Portis' novel, if I credit the Coens rather than Portis for a certain idea I apologize, but that just shows how adept the brothers are at making something their own. I will make certain comparisons to the 1969 original but I've looked at this 2010 version largely on its own merit.

14-year-old Mattie Ross' (Hailee Steinfeld) father is killed by a hired hand named Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), who rides off with her father's horse and two of his California gold pieces. Chaney flees to Indian Territory and while collecting her father's things, Mattie inquires about hiring a U.S. Marshall to track him down. She is told the meanest Marshall in town is Reuben ""Rooster"" Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), described as a ""merciless"" man with ""true grit."" Mattie hires the rugged, whiskey-drinking Rooster on the condition she goes with him. Chaney is also being hunted by a Texas Ranger named LaBoeuf (Matt Damon) who intends to catch Chaney for the murder of a Texas senator and collect on the reward money. Soon, the unlikely trio set out into Indian Territory to track down the man who killed Mattie's father.

Few directors can balance such different genre elements and successful pull it off as well as the Coen Brothers. It's a western, but it works as a comedy, drama, and suspense film with the Coen's dark sense of humor present throughout. Any Coen Brothers fan can spot certain ""Coen moments,"" that are so delightfully odd and/or surreal they could only come from the inventive imaginations of those two. Coen fans will chuckle at the Bear Man character (""I have my bear skin"") and the early hanging scene, as well as several humorous lines that are trademark Coen Brothers humor (such as ""I do not know this man"" and ""You're not LaBoeuf""). The film is quite funny, with several laugh-out-loud moments, the dialogue is delivered with more biting wit, and the Coen's have constructed a much tighter, more cohesive script. LaBoeuf does not hang around needlessly through the entire film, which shifts the focus to the dynamic between Rooster and Mattie while allowing scenes to unfold in a fresher, more exciting way. The ""cabin scene,"" set at night here, may lack Dennis Hopper but is funnier, more suspenseful, and executed better than the '69 film elevating it from a good scene to a riveting sequence.

Another big change is the less picturesque scenery, more barren and rough but still beautiful when shot by the legendary Roger Deakins. His sweeping cinematography has my vote for the Best Cinematography Academy Award with mesmerizing exterior shots and many others that I can see becoming iconic over time. Deakins' infinite talent and ability complements the Coen Brother's creative vision perfectly.

Always masters of casting, the Coens have hired some great character actors, making even the smallest roles memorable. The undertaker (Jarlath Conroy) and Col. Stonehill (Dakin Matthews) are particularly more memorable than they would be in another director's film. The scene between Mattie and Col. Stonehill is an absolute delight to watch. Meanwhile, Brolin makes the most of his little screen-time as the slimy, half-wit Tom Chaney and Barry Pepper (as ""Lucky Ned"" Pepper) disappears into the small role originated by the great Robert Duvall. He's completely unrecognizable, but does bear a resemblance to Duvall in physical appearance and with his voice. Matt Damon's interpretation of LaBoeuf perfectly balances pride and sarcastic wit, but never takes itself too seriously. Some actors would skate dangerously close to parody playing this character the way Damon does but he creates a likeable and well-developed character. Damon has only gotten better with age and his range as an actor rarely brings him the praise he deserves.

Hailee Steinfeld is a marvel as the assertive, fast-talking Mattie bringing great presence and personality to her debut film role. Mattie is an unusually strong female protagonist and it's no easy task for an actress, young or old, to capture that strength and project it so convincingly. Steinfeld is convincing, but she also brings great humor and dignity to the role. This performance is not simply impressive because Steinfeld is 14 years old. If she was in her twenties, this would be an impressive performance as evidenced by Kim Darby's passable portrayal of Mattie Ross in the original at the age of 21. Steinfeld's Mattie is someone you wouldn't want to mess with and she outshines Darby by a mile here. She's a well deserved nominee for Best Supporting Actress with a solid chance of actually winning.

Taking on a role that was originated by an American icon and won that icon an Academy Award seems like it would be a daunting task, but Jeff Bridges is a great actor who seems to have been hitting a creative stride in the last few years. John Wayne's Rooster Cogburn is iconic, but Jeff Bridges completely reinvents the character and gives a performance that may very well become iconic itself. Jeff Bridges' Rooster (who wears the eye-patch on his right eye, instead of his left) is more rugged and (no pun intended) grittier than Wayne's. Complaints have been raised about Bridges' raspy voice (it's been likened to Karl from Sling Blade), with some apparently finding it unintelligible. I find it a perfect fit for the disheveled, drunken Rooster and don't believe that Bridges' natural speaking voice would do justice to the character. I won't compare Wayne's Rooster Cogburn with Bridges' Rooster Cogburn as I feel they are two entirely separate entities, but I will say that Bridges hits an emotional note not present in Wayne's performance. Towards the end you care about Rooster and, while he never says it, you can see he cares for Mattie. It's a great performance.

This film is a great example of how different something can become when handled with a different vision. Look at the courtroom scene early in the film for an example of this. Much of the dialogue is verbatim from the 1969 version, but the scene feels completely different. We get a much different immediate perception of Rooster Cogburn even though he's speaking the same dialogue. Everyone knows the scene from the 1969 version where John Wayne charges, guns blazing, at four men with his horse's reigns in his teeth. That scene doesn't seem quite as epic here, but that single scene is so iconic you can hardly expect it to be. The Coen's interpretation of the story has a much darker tone even when scenes unfold the same way and the dialogue sounds much different even when recited verbatim. The Coens give the film a more realistic, bittersweet epilogue that may perplex some viewers but it just validates that, even when working with familiar elements, the Coens can bring their own unique style to a film and make it their own.

True Grit is the most accessible and commercial film Coen Brothers have made, but this does not detract from what a stunning achievement it is. It is one of the best films of its kind to come out of Hollywood in many years and breathes new life into the comatose western genre. It is one of the best films of 2010, but also one of the most purely enjoyable films of 2010. True Grit is a complete triumph.

I think Jeff Bridges was truer to the book verison of rooster c., I liked Hallee Seinfield in the role of Mattie Ross over Kim Darby's(although miss Darby was good in her role as well)and Matt Damon was much better than Glen Campbell as the texas ranger.

4202162,5,B003UESJME,"...much the same as Rooster.

Fortunate for me, the last time I saw the original I was just a small lads and therefore felt no guilt for insufficient reverence or fidelity to The Duke. My thought going in was that it would be a good time to revisit the original version. Half way through Bridges and Steinfeld were creating such compelling characters that reading the book came to mind. By the end of it however both notions dropped away. Not now; much too soon. The zen of True Grit 2010 is aging nicely and unblended in the  oak-charred-whiskey-barrel of my psyche.

This is 5 stars if ever there was one. I am admittedly a Coen-head but the juxtaposition the Coens, setting, music, and a cast of superb players creating truly unforgettable characters make this the best movie of its kind I have ever seen. I am reluctant to declare it THE best movie I have ever seen in my life but in five weeks watching it every Saturday night I can recall none to surpass it. This is where the guilt kicks in because repeat short-span movie watching is a personal taboo; I could not help myself on this one. My standing applause to all involved with this film, especially Bridges, Steinfeld, Daymon as well the fabulous complimentary cast, Mathews and Pepper especially stick out.

It is a powerful interpretation of the time and place appropriately ratcheted up for entertainment value and masterfully done. The characters range from audacious, colorful, and subtle; but all are authentic. I think there are some Faulkner-esk touches to the story. I plan to make a study of the book after the emotional attachment to the Coen version fades to a manageable degree.

Of the few knits that I have seen picked from professional critics two of them are;
Mattie was too modern and `you are not the boss of me'. I found her temperament to be commensurate with her apparent education (e.g. writ of replevin) and her objective. The event that triggered her mission would plausibly fortify an extra measure of pugnacity and independence. I saw no deviation in any of her character qualities taken collectively.

The other criticism was that the outdoor panoramas seemed washed out. I thought they fit the season; slanted and diffused winter light. That was consistent with the winter light coming in the window at Cogburn's testimony.

I ditto these insightful contributions already well articulated by other reviewers with which I fully concur;

""...the most emotionally engaging movie they've ever made, including Fargo."" [the movie left me with my chest laid open as if by a scatter gun]

""...What elevates this movie from the original is the closer following of the source material: Charles Portis' novel. It isn't perfect, but the Coens portray a much darker, grittier time and circumstances."" [and often times a more tragic world; I think the dirty coats, muddy boots, greasy hair, rotten teeth, and dialogue without contractions were excellent cinematic enhancements.]

""...Jeff Bridges is NOT John Wayne, and, that being said, makes a much better Rooster than John. John was restricted by what he could do as an actor acting in the time the film was made. Jeff is not under such restrictions...."" [clear cut best actor of the year imo]

I have the book and I re-read it so that when the movie came out, I could see how close they stuck to it. Well let me say that except for the ending, the 1969 version is truer to the book than this one. The Coen's changed scenes they didn't need to. They added characters and omitted others. I suppose they did this because they kept saying this wasn't a remake. Call it what you want, remake, reimagine, or reboot, comparisons will still be drawn. I have seen the new TRUE GRIT twice and enjoyed it more the second time BECAUSE I wasn't comparing to the 1969 version. I just wish these people who trash the original would read the book. Rooster is described as ""40'ish, looks like Grover Cleveland with a walrus moustache"". Also no mention of an eye patch, just that his left eye is almost completely closed. Tom Chaney is short and in his mid twenties, while LaBeof has perfectly trimmed aubern hair.

I do hope though, that now Hollywood will see people will pay to go see a well made western. Because that is what this version of TRUE GRIT is. Istill hold the original dear to my heart, but this is a decent film.

  **** Well, this version got left in the dust at the Oscars, but i seem to recall the ORIGINAL was an Oscar winner! ****",1296259200,25,1344,4.300395256916996
4202164,5,B003UESJME,"Scanning over the previous reviews, the point of contention for this film seems to be the ghost of John Wayne - many of the critical reviews were completely satisfied with the earlier version of the film and portray the remake as unnecessary and almost insulting.  I have felt the same way about other remakes; yet while I understand the point, I still feel that this film is extremely entertaining in its own right.  Those unfamiliar with the earlier film starring John Wayne can look at it and judge with unbiased eyes, but even those who appreciate the Duke's performance - if they approach this one as a different film entirely instead of simply a remake - should be able to eke out at least some satisfaction from this effort by the Coens.

The story is - or should be - pretty familiar.  Fourteen-year-old Mattie Ross is bent on revenge for her father's death, and she seeks out Marshall Cogburn, a man with a reputation for 'true grit', to track down the outlaw that committed the murder, Tom Chaney.  Along the way, the two pick up another lawman hunting for Chaney on an unrelated charge, the Texas Ranger LaBoeuf.  Tracking Chaney to the Oklahoma territory, Cogburn and Laboeuf face off against Lucky Ned Pepper's gang, which has taken Chaney in, and in the end, it is Mattie who must find her own store of grit when she meets her father's killer.

It's a minimalist story.  As such, it is really more of a character study than an action film, and those who are used to the hyperkinetic activity in most modern films may find it slow paced or even boring.  But while watching the short trailer for 'True Grit' on IMDb, it would be easy to see how someone might think it is non-stop action.  I suppose no one should look for truth in advertising anymore, but it seems especially misleading to me.  This is one of the other sources of contention with the film, and I'll agree that it does seem to take too long to get going.  But from the moment Mattie fords the river between Fort Smith and the territories, finally in pursuit of Chaney, the movie settles into its own rhythm, and, for this viewer anyway, it is perfectly paced from then on.

I would encourage viewers who enjoy film but shy away from westerns because of their tendency to rely on simplistic plots and monochramatic characters to give this one a try - the time and place of 'True Grit' is incidental.  While I think the directors make fantastic use of western film tropes, essentially it is all about the characters - not as a deep penetrating psychological study, but as an example of diversionary entertainment with an emphasis on people rather than action.  I only have one last quibble with the film, and that is the ending, which may be true to the novel but is tremendously anticlimactic.  No doubt it will draw some comparisons to the ending of 'No Country for Old Men', but while I enjoyed the Coen's earlier effort from start to finish, this one is book-ended by slight missteps that don't so much as detract from the overall value as they just don't amplify the experience.

Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie Ross is quite excellent, while Josh Brolin as Chaney only has a brief time onscreen, and makes only a slight impression.  Barry Pepper, who is probably one of the better actors you've never heard of, ironically plays Lucky NED Pepper, whom we see for approximately the same amount of time, yet he turns in another stellar performance, and Matt Damon, amazingly enough, is nearly able to transcend his Matt Damon-ness to convincingly play Ranger LaBoeuf far better than Glenn Campbell may ever have dreamed of.  Which leads us to Bridges, of course.  This to me is the crucial difference in the films.  Jeff Bridges plays Rooster Cogburn to the point that I forget he is Jeff Bridges, an actor I've never cared much for.  John Wayne, in the earlier version of 'True Grit', plays John Wayne.  There's nothing wrong with either one, in and of themselves - viewers who have a soft spot for the first incarnation of the film may enjoy the second one more if they leave comparisons behind, and accept that these are two different films rather than as if the remake is supposed to be an 'improvement'.

This is an eminently entertaining movie - four-and-a-half stars since I'd stop short of calling it a masterpiece - but a great night out at the movies nonetheless.  Engrossing and highly satisfactory.",1296172800,8,4384,4.647668393782383

True Grit is a 2010 American Western film written and directed by the Coen brothers. It is the second adaptation of Charles Portis' 1968 novel of the same name, which was previously adapted for film in 1969 starring John Wayne. The film stars Hailee Steinfeld as Mattie Ross, and Jeff Bridges as U.S. Marshal Reuben J. ""Rooster"" Cogburn along with Matt Damon, Josh Brolin, and Barry Pepper.

My Thoughts
Awesome, Awesome, Awesome!!!
I had been craving a new western for a long, long time.  Let me rephrase that, a new western that didn't suck.  Honestly, there just hadn't been one, not for a long time.  I saw the trailer for True Grit and I immediately thought, I must go see this film and bring my step-father with me, he too would love it.  Irving, a long time John Wayne fan appreciates all things John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, and Jeff Bridges...and boats...Irving likes boats.
Jeff Bridges is spectacular as Cogburn and truly gave an Oscar worthy performance.  Hailee Steinfield stole movie and every scene that she was in; it's hard to believe that she is only 14 years old.  She will be one to watch over the years.
The novel was written from Mattie Ross' point of view; the John Wayne version changed the ending and focused on Rooster Cogburn.  The Coen Brother's adaptation follows Portis' novel with quick and clever dialogue and a pinch of humor.
Even if you don't like westerns you should check out this flick.  The cast is rounded out nicely with Matt Damon, Josh Brolin, & Barry Pepper.  I will be getting this on DVD or BLU RAY when it is released.

While I understand that someone's wife went to sleep in the first fifteen minutes and someone else (Beaumont Nantucket) didn't like it because it was ""dull"" (read: nothing blew up), I feel that anyone with the slightest idea of what makes a movie a GOOD movie will certainly like this movie.  Jeff Bridges is NOT John Wayne, and, that being said, makes a much better Rooster than John.  John was restricted by what he could do as an actor acting in the time the film was made.  Jeff is not under such restrictions.  Hailee, the actress playing Mattie Ross, deserves the Oscar for her work, if for nothing else other than the seamless way she can shift from ""too grown up for her age"" to childlike fear in a blink of an eye.  The Coen deserve the Oscar just for taking on the project.

I've read that the Coen brothers did not see this film as a remake, since they took their inspiration from the original Charles Portis novel, even using much of the book's dialogue.  It is that dialogue which makes this film a delight for the ear as well as the eye.  The scene in which Steinfeld haggles over the price of some horses is especially well-written and -acted.  Bridges inhabits the role of Rooster Cogburn in his usual understated manner.  The contrast between his rough manners (we can almost see his body odor) and the flashy Texas Ranger (complete with jangling spurs) who joins in the hunt (Matt Damon) permits the Coens to explore the full spectrum of personalities that attempted to keep the peace in a land that was filling up faster than the law could keep pace.  Both Steinfeld and Bridges are likely contenders for Oscars and deservedly so.  I shaved one star because of some unlikely coincidences and moments when characters appear out of nowhere at just the right moment.",1295740800,2,1133,4.839378238341969

I won't go into details about what the movie is about because if you want that, go check out the item description. I will just speak about the good and the bad.

Good:
Acting (Top Notch, Jeff was perfect as the drunk, one eyed Rooster, Brolin surprised me as he was completely perfect and the man deserves an oscar already, Damon was perfect as the Texas Ranger, and finally Hailee(Hope I spelled that right) was utterly perfect as the leading lady herself. She HAS to be nominated for an oscar or there is no justice in the world)
Score (Music was beautiful and fit the movie well)
Story (The story was an interesting one but was perfect and exciting, it kept me watching for 10 minutes before I sadly was forced to blink)

Bad:
I only have two complaints. One, it was too short, it needed to be atleast three hours so I could keep watching utter perfection. And two, Hailee was perfect but they say her character was 14 but she really doesn't look like a 14 year old to me, but thats just my opinion. Oh and that (SPOILER) Little Blacky died! That made me so sad!

So all in all, this was easily the best movie of the year, next to The Kids Are Alright, Black Swan, and Inception. The best western I have seen since 3 10 to Yuma.

4202213,5,B003UESJME,"Joel and Ethan Coen's adaption of Charles Portis's novel ""True Grit"" is, for my money, in the top tier of their work, and a very fine movie.

For readers who think they don't like Westerns, I don't generally like them either. I enjoy looking at the horses and landscapes, but most of the time the simplistic stories and stilted acting bore me. There are a couple of exceptions, typically comic takes on the genre like ""Two Mules for Sister Sara,"" but in general, not a fan. I've never seen the 1969 version of ""True Grit"" with John Wayne, so I will neither cloud nor enlighten, depending on your feelings about it, this review with comparisons to it.

I'll start with the script, which is truly unusual. It hews closely to the novel, itself a small masterpiece of deadpan comic genius. The narrator, Mattie Ross, is a middle-aged spinster looking back on an adventure she had at age 14 shortly after the Civil War, seeking  revenge on her father's killer, Tom Chaney, in Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). Mattie speaks with the stern and proper diction and Biblical references of a 19th century Presbyterian preacher. Initially I found the spoken language in the film a bit disconcerting, but as with Shakespeare, once I fell into its old-fashioned rhythm, I loved the bone-dry humor and the sense of time and place it evoked.

The acting has been widely and justly praised. Jeff Bridges as Rooster Cogburn, the Deputy US Marshal Mattie hires to track her father's killer, truly inhabits this run-down character whose morality has been shaped, some would say horribly distorted, by the harshness of the Civil War and life in the wild frontier thereafter. He's a drunk and a southerner, but there his similarities with the character he played in ""Crazy Heart"" end. Hailee Steinfeld, a 14-year-old girl from Tarzana, CA, is brilliantly provoking, funny and finally admirable as the whip-smart, determined Mattie. She handles the old-fashioned language well, does not suffer at all from misguided efforts to be cute or charming, and never seems like a modern kid playing dress-up, a fault I frequently find with child actors in period films. Matt Damon, who can be a bit bland, is perfectly cast here as the Texas Ranger LaBoeuf who accompanies Mattie and Cogburn on their hunt for Tom Chaney. Damon is vain, self-important, funny, and ultimately heroic. I gained a lot of respect for Damon with this movie. The smaller roles are, as always with the Coens, well-cast and memorably played.

Roger Deakins' cinematography is my favorite of his work for the Coens. He's always been brilliant at capturing just the right lighting and mood. This is the first time I remember him capturing so many images of pure, jaw-dropping beauty.

This is a Coen Brothers movie, and you will find bits of the weirdness you've come to look forward to. Among the Coenesque treats they add to the book is a scene where Mattie spends a night with her father's body at the undertaker's. Playing the hymn ""Leaning on the Everlasting Arms""  over the closing credits has to be another of their perfectly-selected and perfectly-placed tributes to ""The Night of the Hunter."" Still, for the most part, they tell the story in a straightforward manner, and the result is perhaps the most emotionally engaging movie they've ever made, including ""Fargo.""

While the Coens will always have my gratitude and respect for avoiding formulaic popcorn-munching fare, some of their movies really don't connect for me. I fell asleep at ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" and I couldn't love ""No Country for Old Men,"" though that was partly a problem I had with the source material. I found ""True Grit"" to be fast-moving (except for one somewhat slow scene at the beginning where Cogburn is testifying about an arrest he made, intended to expose his violent approach to law enforcement) and involving from start to finish. I was sobbing when I left the theater, and I've NEVER cried at a Coen Brothers movie. The price Mattie and her horse Little Blackie pay for revenge is a high one. As Mattie says, nothing is free except the grace of God, and that cannot be deserved or earned.

I can't say I think ""True Grit"" will be everyone's cup of tea. The humor won't be to all tastes, and it gets pretty violent at times, but its a lovely, lovingly-made film, appropriate for ages 10 and up (maybe older depending on how you feel about the violence).",1295481600,4,4391,4.812997347480106
4202214,4,B003UESJME,"A young girl hires a marshal to go after the killer of her father. She accompanies him, determined to see that her dad's death is avenged.

1. Boring as hell. Talk, talk, talk, dragged out scenes, this is just DULL.
2. The lead, Hailee Steinfeld, got on my nerves in the first five to ten minutes. Her ridiculously proper speech and bratty demeanor are so grating that anytime she was in a wee spot of danger, I was actually hoping something so un-Hollywood would happen and she would bite the dust. No such luck.
3. The Coens just dragged it out too long. I'm a big fan of their work, but not this turkey. Their storytelling on this one is so scattered. I couldn't wait for it to end.

An annoying lead, an incomprehensible, overbearing Jeff Bridges, and a long, boring story, what could be worse?",1295136000,17,820,4.423841059602649
4202236,4,B003UESJME,"True Grit by Charles Portis is easily one of my favorite novels. In 1969 it was adapted into a film starring John Wayne (in which he won an Academy Award), and while it took several liberties from the book I found it a decently entertaining film. This new adaptation by the Coen brothers is much more faithful to the novel and is an enjoyable movie as well but like it's predecessor seems to be missing something.

The story of True Grit follows 14 year old Mattie Ross who's looking to avenge the murder and robbery of her father by Tom Chaney. She hires U.S. Marshal Cogburn and along with Texas Ranger LaBoeuf they set out after the killer. The story is very sharply filmed with a believable ""Western"" setting and is filled with the quirkiness and dark-humor we've come to expect from a Coen Brother's movie. The action scenes and gunfights are very tense and exciting giving a sense of realism and credibility to the story.

Unfortunately as well-filmmed as this movie is there seems to be something a bit off with the screenplay, namely the characterizations. Don't get me wrong, all of the separate characters are three-dimensional but they still feel..well, SEPARATE. While True Grit's story stays (wisely) centered on Mattie her, Cogburn, and Laboeuf's motivations seem to keep changing on the fly with little to no (believable) explanation. It was hard to feel a connection in any of them which takes away a lot of the dramatic impact (especially from the ending). Even their humor seemed misguided at times like the Coen brothers weren't sure what kind of film they wanted to make.

Thankfully while the characterizations are a bit sketchy, the performances in True Grit are outstanding! Hailee Steinfeld is exceptionally good as Mattie and she brings humanity and humor to her character (the scene's with her and Stonehill are hysterical!) and has you rooting for her. Jeff Bridges is fun to watch as the burned-out Cogburn as is Matt Damon as the self-assured LeBoeuf. Josh Brolin and Barry Pepper are excellent and memorable as Tom Chaney and Ned Pepper, which is impressive considering how little screen time they are given.

While I still have my complaints about True Grit I'm sure most people (particularly Coen brothers fans) won't be bothered by it's short-comings. It's still a very entertaining movie with excellent performances and great directing and camera work. It's worth seeing, I just wish I cared a bit more about the characters.",1295136000,,2458,4.9014423076923075
4202237,5,B003UESJME,"I actually don't really like Westerns, but I loved this movie.  It had great casting, dialogue, scenery, and a good storyline.  There may have been a few quirks here and there, but not enough to keep this from being a five star movie to me.

Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld) is a fourteen year old girl who has come to town to collect the body of her father.  In addition to this, she is on a mission to also find his killer Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin)and see him hanged.  To do this, after asking around, she hires dubious lawman (although he supposedly has grit) Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges). After much argument on whether she can go on the trip or not, they set off with the addition of a Texas Ranger La Beouf (Matt Damon) who has been in pursuit of Chaney since he killed a man in Texas.

They don't stay together long though.  La Beouf and Cogburn just rub each other wrong and they split up, with Mattie staying with Cogburn.  They encounter plenty of danger and with Cogburn's senses sometimes not the best from drinking, Mattie has her doubts.  Chaney has taken up with a gang of robbers and the stakes become even higher.  Mattie realizes just what kind of danger she has gotten herself into, but is still determined to capture her father's killer.

The characters were all very well cast in this movie.  The fact that Mattie was an unknown was excellent, and she did an amazing job that let you really connect with her character.  Jeff Bridges was funny as Cogburn and he really pulled off the gruff, funny Marshall well.  Matt Damon's character was a bit annoying, but I think that maybe he was supposed to be.

The scenes were all shot in beautiful places and there was only one that seemed out of place.  The scene with snakes was kind of fake looking, but luckily it wasn't that long of a scene.  They played mostly instrumental music throughout the movie but it fit in nicely with the different scenes.  Weak stomached people or people with young children should take note however, this movie contains a lot of violence and gore that is not shielded from viewers eyes.

I definitely plan on adding this movie to my home collection.  It's one I could watch over and over.

4202238,4,B003UESJME,"How is this different from other movies the Coens have made? I keep reading reviews where it says that ""True Grit"" is a ""departure"" from their previous work. Even Roger Ebert thinks so. I just saw the film and i can tell you that all of their usual trademarks are there. You would have shown me this film without telling me that it was from the Coen brothers and i'm pretty sure that i would have guessed it. Their dark humour is there. You see their usual off-beat characters, some with funny faces, all of them speaking with a certain eloquence (even the villains), you also have your strange character that suddenly appears and then goes away without never really realizing the point of it, they show us their usual and beautiful scenery modelled on precise storyboards, you witness some scene-stealing perfomances from wordy-characters, you can't escape their incredible quick outbursts of violence here and there, you have your usual Carter Burwell soundtrack, you again have a conclusion that is not ""Hollywood-like"" and always, you are amazed by their renewed talent.

Is it because it's a western? Even that, you could see it coming in their filmography. Some of their previous films are modern westerns to me (""No Country For Old Men"" mostly). No really, ""True Grit"" is a true Coen movie. Everything you love about the brothers is there. Everything you hate also, if that ain't your thing. It's ""The Coen Brothers meet the Far West"". That's what it is. You'd give them a science-fiction movie and you would recognize their style, sensibilities and multiple layared screenplay anyway. Their dialogs are unique and you'd always notice their slightly caricatural characters and situations. Even in space or during Antiquity.

""True Grit"" is like any other movies the Coens have made: Excellent and a true cinema happening. But they are like Woody Allen. You either love them or you hate them. There is no in-between. I suggest you love them. With a passion. You'll be the winner. And you'll learn something about cinema. Each time.",1294963200,2,2037,4.9186046511627906
4202239,4,B003UESJME,"The brothers Joel and Ethan Coen must have taken a lot of heat for daring to remake (or rework, depending on how you look at it) the classic 1969 Henry Hathaway-directed western TRUE GRIT, which gave John Wayne the sole Oscar of his career. But the end result, with Jeff Bridges, no stranger to westerns he (RANCHO DELUXE; BAD COMPANY; WILD BILL), in the role that the Duke cemented forever in people's minds, is no slouch of a film either.

Once again, a teenager named Mattie Ross (here played by Hailee Steinfield, in the role Kim Darby had) hires the crusty, whiskey-drinking Cogburn (Bridges) to hunt down Tom Cheney (Josh Brolin, taking over for Jeff Corey), the man who killed her father, as well as Brolin's gang, headed up by ""Lucky"" Ned Pepper (Barry Pepper, in the role Robert Duvall parlayed in '69). Matt Damon, meanwhile, tags along as LaBeouf, the greenhorn Texas Ranger (played by Glen Campbell back then) who proves he, like the feisty Mattie, shows some ""true grit"" of his own to stand up to Bridges' hard-charging marshal. The film, though somewhat longer than an audience weaned on headache-inducing 3D and MTV-inspired montage editing might like, moves at a fairly fast pace, thanks to Bridges' salty performance as Cogburn, and the Coen Brothers' eye for period dialog, set design, and music (provided by the Coens' regular composer Carter Burwell). And Steinfield gives a great and marvelously unruffled performance as Mattie--a role that probably ought to earn her at least an Oscar nomination.

It's never easy for Hollywood to do remakes of anything, especially not Westerns, particularly those where John Wayne was involved; but the Coens' effort at reworking TRUE GRIT doesn't disappoint. If Bridges' performance as Rooster Cogburn doesn't necessarily outshine the Duke's, it is not out of lack of trying; he just gives a different, but equally valid, portrayal. Many of the original film's most famous lines are repeated almost verbatim (including the always-memorable ""Fill your hand, you son-of-a-b**ch!""). In the end, it may very well get people to ask why Hollywood went stone-cold on the Western, even after it proved its worth in recent times with films like UNFORGIVEN, TOMBSTONE, and OPEN RANGE. When made with the kind of care and authenticity shown here, along with solid performances from all concerned, the Western can still show the kind of ""true grit"" that the Coens' film, like the Henry Hathaway/John Wayne epic before it, showed.",1294876800,6,2475,5.048899755501222
4202240,5,B003UESJME,"John Wayne's lone Academy Award was for the first film version of True Grit, even if some felt the award represented a ""lifetime achievement"".  Still, if you're going to produce a film that is guaranteed to be compared to the best of The Duke, you'd better know what you're doing.  Joel and Ethan Coen know what they're doing.

This film version of Charles Portis' novel has a scruffy texture that feels more realistic than dozens of Westerns - including the great 1969 John Wayne version.  We open in a Fort Smith Arkansas that looks like a bustling, growing frontier town rather than a few Hollywood prop houses erected along a muddy boulevard.  We meet Maddie Ross - played by young Hailee Steinfield in a career-making turn.  Fourteen-year-old Maddie has come to town because her father has been murdered by ne'er do well Tom Chaney, played by Josh Brolin.  Chaney has fled to the Indian Territories and the gang of Lucky Ned Pepper, played with rotten-toothed enthusiasm by Barry Pepper.  In his early scenes Mr. Pepper seems to be recreating the earlier performance by Robert Duvall.  Later, his inflection reminded me of Brando.  If you're an actor looking for role models you could do far worse than Duvall and Brando.

The local sheriff tells Maddie he can't pursue Chaney because he has no jurisdiction in the Indian Territory.  She is told that a Federal Marshall may take on the task.  She asks which Marshall would be the best and is told that this one is the best tracker, and that one is the best overall and the meanest and most ruthless of the Marshalls is Rooster Cogburn.  Maddie tracks down Rooster in court where he is giving testimony about the twenty-third man he has killed on the job.  She knows she has the right man and offers him a fifty dollar bounty on top of the usual reward as Chaney is now a wanted man.  Rooster was the John Wayne role in the original film, and it's difficult to imagine how daunting it must have been to try a new take on Rooster Cogburn.  Fresh from his first Oscar, and familiar with the Coen Brothers from his work in another iconic role - as the leading ""Dude"" in ""The Big Lebowski"" - Jeff Bridges throws himself into the role of Rooster Cogburn in a way that made me not miss John Wayne at all.  Rooster is old and fat and ""likes to pull a cork"" so Maddie is taking no small risk giving all her money to Rooster, then following him on the manhunt.

Rounding out the cast is Matt Damon as Laboeuf, a Texas Ranger who is after an even larger reward than Maddie's fifty dollars: it seems Mr. Chaney also murdered a Texas Senator, so the reward in Texas is even higher.  Damon is a significant upgrade from Glen Campbell in the earlier film.  One of my personal movie pet peeves occurs when a non-southerner tries adopting a southern accent.  Massachusetts-raised Damon brings the right voice and the right ""I'm-a-Texas-RANGER"" pride to the role.

In addition to infusing their brilliant western with the correct ""grit"" the Coen's leaven the film with humor and light moments that produce delight at every turn.

This film has earned a place among the greatest Westerns.  Unforgiven.  The Searchers.  Dances With Wolves.  The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. True Grit.  Lonesome Dove. I love John Wayne and the original film, but if I only had the choice of watching one version - I'd choose this one.",1294531200,4,3353,4.616554054054054
4202241,5,B003UESJME,"Joel and Ethan Cohen are my favorite filmmakers. They always manage to create interesting, unusual, highly memorable films filled with funny, original characters. Some of their films are better than others, but they are all good, offering us glimpses into strange worlds pulled from the minds of this duo. And they are on quite a streak, producing a series of films remarkable for even this team. Their latest, ""True Grit"" reunites them with Jeff Bridges and Josh Brolin, adding Matt Damon and a remarkable performance from newcomer Hallie Steinfeld to create one of their best films yet.

Mattie Ross (Steinfeld) arrives in town to deal with her father's death at the hands of the coward Tom Chaney (Brolin) who has most certainly fled into the neighboring Indian country. The young lady, accompanied by a family servant, makes her way to the undertakers, quickly identifies her father's remains and makes preparations for the servant to accompany the body back home. Mattie has other plans and intends to stay in town for a few days. She quickly learns U.S. Marshall Rooster Cogburn (Bridges) is in town and it takes some work, but she eventually gains a face to face meeting and explains she wants to track down Chaney and bring him back to justice. Cogburn is reluctant, so she turns to Texas Ranger LaBeouf (Damon) who is already in town to apprehend the same man for other violations. The two men eventually agree to work together and help the young woman.

The Coen Brothers have apparently used the original book as the basis for their new film, keeping the original John Wayne vehicle at arm's length. I have never seen the original, not a fan of the Duke, but I have to believe this newer version is a more accurate depiction of life in the Old West. And closer to the original book as well. I just can't believe John Wayne's Cogburn is introduced in the same way as Bridge's interpretation. And the Coens have populated the story with unusual, interesting characters, characters who look and act like you would expect people living in the Old West to act. At one point, Rooster and Mattie cross paths with Bear Man, a self-proclaimed veterinarian, doctor and dentist. The man, wearing a bear fur with the bear's head sitting on his head, talks in a slow, halting way, much like someone who has little interaction with other people might. It must seem strange for him to speak, let alone see and interact with others when he spends so much time on the trail alone. They meet a small handful of people, each different and unusual, each affected by life in the Old West..

For that matter, this is part of the reason Bridges' portrayal is, well, kind of brilliant. From the moment we first hear Rooster, Bridges perfectly embodies the character; Cogburn has spent so much time on the trail, alone, he has difficulty relating to others as we currently feel would be proper. But in his day and age, Cogburn maybe came into contact with hundreds of people over the course of his life. There simply weren't that many people then. It is difficult for him to come up with a pleasantry when Bear Man makes an appearance. Instead, his first words are ""You are not LaBeouf"", as though it is Bear Man's fault he is not who they were looking for.

Matt Damon plays Texas Ranger LaBeouf, a man who seems desperate to uphold the romantic ideals of his organization. In town to bring Chaney to justice, he  agrees to help Mattie in her quest for justice. When he and Cogburn begin working together, it quickly becomes clear the two men would prefer to continue working alone. But LaBeouf adapts and even seems to enjoy the company. Cogburn, on the other hand, does not adapt so well and the other man's constant chatter gets under his skin, causing him to become even more ornery.

Damon is just about always good and LaBeouf is an interesting character. At one point, the Ranger experiences some physical challenges which he quickly overcomes and these only seem to make him more steadfast and determined. Damon is able to make us believe he is experiencing these problems for real keeping them in our mind throughout, helping LaBeouf really stand out.

Josh Brolin's portrayal of Chaney is good, but it is little more than a cameo. There are more than a few instances of high profile actors taking on small, pivotal roles in films; Chaney is the reason for the film, yet we actually only live with him for a few minutes. Marlon Brando's Colonel Kurtz in ""Apocalypse Now"" and Orson Welles' Harry Lime in ""The Third Man"" are the best examples of this type of role. On the one hand, his character is very important and you feel like you know enough. On the other, you want to get to know more about him. Because of the importance of his character, it makes no sense to let an unknown actor play the role.

Hallie Steinfeld does a remarkably good job as Mattie Ross. From the moment we first lay eyes on her, we know she is a very mature young lady. She quickly sends the family servant away, essentially leaving her to her own devices, to survive on her own in the Old West, to handle her dead father's affairs. Our initial concerns about a fourteen year old on her own in the frontier are quickly put to rest as we witness how well she deals with the men in this world. If she can conquer these men, nothing will stand in her way. Strangely, she seems to have more trouble with the few women she encounters; the owner of her father's boarding house welcomes her to her ample bosom yet is unable to meet her simple requests.

This year two of the best performances in film have come from two young newcomers. Earlier this summer, Jennifer Lawrence was mesmerizing in ""Winter's Bone"" as another young woman forced to be an adult before her time. If you haven't seen ""Winter's Bone"" you are missing out on one of the best films of the year. In most years, we would be lucky to have one such great performance. It is a treat to have two.

The Coen Brothers have worked overtime to bring such a high level of attention to detail to the film. The film begins with an Iris Open effect, commonly used in silent film, and when Mattie arrives in the small town, we feel as though we have stepped back in time to join her. This essentially allows the brothers to lead us into this new world with the heroine. Later, a discussion between Cogburn and LaBeouf contains, a co-worker tells me, references to real skirmishes in the Civil War, giving us deeper insight into their characters. We witness a trial involving Cogburn as a witness, giving us a glimpse into many other facets of life in the Old West.

The Coen Brothers earned their reputation for a series of off the wall, almost slapstick comedies filled with eccentric, strange characters. In the last few years, they have shifted their focus towards a more diverse selection of stories. ""Fargo"" is a very funny movie, but it also deals with a lot of human pain. ""No Country for Old Men"" is a frightening tale of revenge and the efforts of one man to stop the killer. ""A Serious Man"" is a deeply introspective look at a college professor in the 60s, a man who seems to have been inspired by some of their father's own history. ""Man"" is a real puzzle; strange and hard to decipher, I have seen the film three times and appreciate it more each time. Now with ""True Grit"", they turn to a story perfect for their sensibilities. It allows them to explore a violent, at times humorous, tale filled with strange and unusual characters.

""True Grit"" is the perfect Coen Brothers' vehicle and a great example of their skill and craft.",1294444800,5,7564,4.594814814814815
4202242,1,B003UESJME,"I love western movies, but this truly had to be the most cheezy, boring,and dull remake of a classic I've ever seen. Here are many more problems with this movie below:

1. The little girl is way too anoying that throughout the first 10 minutes you wished she would leave the screen. Instead she's the main character, so your stuck with a whinning little brat the whole wasted time watching.
2. Hardly any gunfights and the small few are poorly played out as if your watching Little House On The Prairy.
3. Extremely boring, with no suspence,the main bad guy seems to be too nice and fake, real crappy acting.
4. This movie should've been rated G and can easily be understood by 3 year olds.",1294444800,19,690,4.476190476190476
4202243,5,B003UESJME,"True Grit is a true hit!

The Cohen Brothers mark this film with their personal and unique trademark making it so much more than a remake.  At first I wondered why anyone would want to re-make 'True Grit', a classic movie remembered well by fans old enough to have seen the original at its release and discovered later by younger fans who value a great film.  But this 'True Grit' turned out to be so much more than the original.  I was blown away by this film and am so glad I overcame my initial hesitancy about seeing it.

Jeff Bridges gives another Oscar-worthy, astonishingly dead-on character-driven, picture-perfect performance as Rooster Cogburn.  It is hard to know exactly how Bridges could be so perfectly `Bad Blake' and also so perfectly `Rooster Cogburn' when those two characters were so very different.  Well, okay, maybe they had the hankering for booze in common, but otherwise, these two spot-on portrayals are just a beautiful testament to Jeff Bridges' transformation over the years from a perfectly solid performer to an absolutely amazing actor.

Matt Damon shows another side to his acting abilities as well, in a pretty darn acceptable performance as Texas Ranger, La Boeuf, even if his performance was a bit subdued in this otherwise larger-than-life-character populated film.

Rounding out the top cast members, if Jeff Bridges should be considered for an Oscar nomination this year, and be assured - he should, so too should young actress, Hailee Steinfeld, whom I admit to not having seen previously, but after her performance as 14-year-old Mattie, I don't think many movie attendees will be able to claim non-acquaintance with Ms. Steinfeld  much longer.

Carter Burwell's music in `True Grit' just every bit as perfectly fit the characters, the events, and the surroundings and atmosphere in this film as it did in the sweeping hit `The Alamo', albeit, without the soulful fiddle solo Davey Crockett delivered in the huge tale of Texas.  Burwell's movie music is always perfection in every way.

Female vocalist, Iris DeMent, who joined John Prine in a somewhat `blue', but oh-so-enjoyable, giggle-producing duet at the end of Billy Bob Thornton's great familial tale `Daddy and Them', sings a solo as the closing song of `True Grit'.  Iris delivers a beautiful, heart-felt rendition of `Leaning on The Everlasting Arms', which was also instrumentally featured throughout the film.  I have not heard such a moving vocal rendition of `Leaning.....' since it was so hauntingly performed a capella by Robert Mitchum in `The Night of the Hunter' back in 1955 when it made my childish blood run cold, and it still does every time I re-watch the DVD.

`True Grit' contains some of the most beautiful scenes I have seen in a western film in a great long time, all due to the masterful talent of Roger Deakins.  These scenes are not just the usual sprawling expanses of mountains, trees, and rivers routinely seen in films that are shot in the west or in the southern part of the U.S. (most of `True Grit' was shot in Texas).  The familiar panoramas are certainly present in `True Grit' and they are pleasingly presented; but the viewer is also treated to several astoundingly beautiful artful creations including some absolutely gorgeous moonlit scenes and glorious, visually pleasing star-filled skies, as well as some stunning snowfall episodes.  I want to add, these are not exactly smooth, rich and lush visual offerings, they are created with just enough `roughness' to fit perfectly within the genre and atmosphere of the film and still take your breath away.

One other thing I want to mention is the wonderful to-die-for dialogue.  I understand a great deal of this was lifted directly from the novel and was also in the original film, which I saw at the time of its first release.  However, I admit to not only not recalling the intricacy of the dialogue, but also not recollecting the unique dialect used in this version, nor being so entertained by the richness of the prose, or sufficiently in awe that the actors could actually remember so much priceless verbage and deliver it with such pitch-perfect ease.  The conversations, by each of the cast members, down to the smallest part, are alone worth the price of the film.

I have not mentioned anything about the plot, not wanting to include any spoilers.  The novel and original film were sufficiently far enough in the past (1968 for the novel and 1969 for the film) I am certain there are many movie fans reading this review-of-sorts are not at all familiar with either version, having never read the novel nor viewed John Wayne, Glen Campbell, Kim Darby, or Robert Duvall, in the original movie offering.

I want to recommend this latest version of `True Grit' as a true future classic, but also as a very enjoyable and entertaining film, one best viewed, at least initially, on a theater screen, preferably the widest one a fan can find today.  We have all been reading a lot lately about  at the questionable caliber of adult movies being made today.  This is one great film that will surely satisfy a fan's desire for a `real, authentic, fine, fine movie'; it certainly did mine.  I have enough family, friends, and acquaintances who have seen this film that they include a certain percentage who do not necessarily agree with my assessment, but their biggest failing seems to be in not recognizing that this is a Cohen Brother's film and not your parent's 'True Grit' and also it is so much more than your usual western.",1294358400,8,5517,4.875802997858672
4202244,4,B003UESJME,"This movie is a very ambitious undertaking by the Coens who are perhaps the best ambitious project writers & directors around. That this would be compared to the original TRUE GRIT & that Jeff Bridges would face comparison with John Wayne's Rooster Cogburn was inevitable.

Yet this is a different TRUE GRIT. Not in major story line but rather in the personalities as displayed in the book. Truth be told, the original, which I love, was much more John Wayne does John Wayne in TRUE GRIT than it was John Wayne becomes Rooster Cogburn in TRUE GRIT. The Coens set out to make a movie truer to its literary source & in that they have succeeded.

I heard one complaint that Jeff Bridges would never be anything but Lloyd Bridge's son to a reviewer. How prejudicially blind. For one thing Jeff Bridges is a far better actor (able to change personality to fit a role) than his father & most certainly exceeds John Wayne who was a TOWERING screen presence but had to be cast as John Wayne or look & sound poorly. Wayne's voice was far beyond his control. Bridges will never equal that presence but who can?

I heard that there were times when Bridges speech was hard to understand. Are we to send him to the alcoholic school for elocution? Of course he was difficult to understand, he was a raging drunk as in the book, not the grinning drinker Wayne played. Quite frankly it reminded me of the time I read a review that stated a certain girl walked around & looked vacant which made the show poor. She was playing a withdrawn girl with deep emotional problems, duh!

This movie is a marvelously period perfect movie & the outdoor shots are the equal of any good western around. Matt Damon gives his best performance doing the Texas Ranger according to the book, and he became a better actor in doing so. Josh Brolin & Hailee Steinfeld (who is a great foil for Bridge's Cogburn) makes no mistakes in their portrayals either.

This is a master piece of literary translation & a tremendous job of casting, acting & photography. I see so many shows now that have too many close-ups with no facial expression to see. Not so here. They made good use of close ups.

If you intend to go see this & judge whether it is the equal of the original, you will be disappointed. It's not meant to be a modern original. This show is its own interpretation of the story of True Grit. If you intend to judge Bridges or any other character on whether they equaled the original you are wasting your time. This movie is an entire show on its own. It is the book in video images & the combination of personalities make a complete story. I loved it.

In honor of The Duke who is unmatched in force & stature, I respectfully withhold a 1/2 star from this show. I think the Coens might be willing to accept that.

4202246,5,B003UESJME,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

True Grit (2010) is a new film by Brothers Coen for which they wrote the screenplay based on the eponymous cult western novel by Charles Portis. The novel was first brought to screen back in 1969 with John Wayne as the eye-patched, heavy drinking, trigger happy US Marshall Reuben ""Rooster"" Cogburn in Fort Smith, Arkansas, 1877, the possessor of ""true grit"" who was hired by a 14 year old girl Mattie Ross to find the killer of her father and to bring him to justice. During the last two weeks, I saw both films back to back and found them gripping, entertaining and very well made.

I did not read the Charles Portis' novel and I can't say I am a big westerns fan even though I've seen and enjoyed some of them but I am a longtime loyal fan of all things Coen and I did not miss a single one of their movies. I sincerely believe that the Coens do not make bad movies for the simple reason they don't know how. True Grit is their first Western, and the first film since 2003 rated PG 13. For many fans that always wait impatiently for their next film, the brothers' choice of the material was a surprise. Coens had only remade one film before True Grits (The Ladykillers), and they never made a pure western before but after watching True Grit, it is perfectly clear that their latest film is a ""true Coens"", the western as only Ethan and Joel could have made it. According to Ethan Coen, before the shooting started, the Coens wanted to make a more faithful adaptation of the novel and to tell the story the way it was told in the book: from the point of view of Mattie Ross, the 14 years old girl who set her mind on hiring the right man for the job of finding and bringing to justice the murderer of her father. The newcomer Halee Steinfeld brings such incredible independence, sharpness, courage, intellect and toughness to the character of Mattie that she more than holds on her own in the scenes she shares with the true stars/talented actors, such as Jeff Bridges, Matt Damon, Josh Brolin, and Barry Pepper among others. As wonderful as these actors are, this is Halley/Mattie's film, and she owns it from her first appearance.

The Coens mentioned that the novel is tough, violent, and funny, and that's how they wanted to adapt it to the screen. I believe that they achieved their goal because their adaptation of the novel is a ""true Coens"" -very dark, violent (I personally could not watch the scene in the snake-pit and had to turn away) yet funny - thanks to another memorable performance from Jeff Bridges as Rooster Cogburn and Coens 'unique dark humor which is in the dialogs and the characters' personalities. The screen chemistry among Bridges, Steinfeld, and Matt Damon as Texas Ranger, who is also in search of Tom Chaney for another murder, is very strong and watching three of them together is the viewers' delight. My only problem with the Bridges' performance is the way he speaks his lines. It was hard to understand what he was saying and some of the Coens'-Portis' writings were lost on me. In this regard, following John Wayne's Rooster was much easier.

As always, Coens' cooperation with the brilliant cinematographer Roger Deakins, produced the film of indescribable beauty and authentic atmosphere of the time long passed. The scene close to the end of the film where Rooster rushes on the horseback to get bitten by the deadly rattlesnake Mattie to the doctor as the day light changes to darkness and the huge surreal stars lit the sky is breathtaking and its beauty brought the tears to my eyes. It is without doubt the most memorable shot in the Coens-Deakins movies for me. I realize that the awards may not be important in order to recognize and to admire Deakins' vision but it was upsetting to find out that in spite of having been behind the camera for dozens of the greatest films from over 20 years, he has never been awarded the Oscar for his work. This is a criminal oversight from the Academy of Motion Pictures and I hope that he will be rewarded for his camera-work in ""True Grit"".

Some viewers and critics find he end of the film rushed and somehow abrupt. Wrong. It is a perfect ending to a perfect film; besides, it follows the novel's ending faithfully. It is different from more optimistic final of the older version but both finals fit their films very well.

Renowned film critic Roger Ebert wrote about Ethan and Joel Coen's ""Fargo"": ""Films like ""Fargo"" are why I love the movies,"" I would say, it is true about every one of the Ethan and Joel Coens' films including the adaptation of True Grit.",1293926400,5,4594,4.5624242424242425
4202247,1,B003UESJME,"Trying to remake a movie with characters brought to life be either John Wayne or Robert Duvall is just plain stupid.  Bridges is a good actor but nowhere near the Rooster that Wayne was.  Was Bridges saying his lines with marbles in his mouth or in the book did Rooster have a speech impediment?  There were times I really didn't even understand him.  And the girl playing Mattie couldn't even hold Kim Darby's dirty clothes.  She was totally uninspiring if you compare the zest with which Darby played the part.  I even missed Glenn Campbell and a young Robert Duvall as Lucky Ned Pepper.  To be fair to Bridges, Wayne was an icon who really just played John Wayne, a larger than life  American treasure.  An Oscar nomination for Bridges?  I certainly hope not.  This portrayal doesn't merit one.  Besides, if Eastwood was not nominated for Gran Torino it would be criminal to nominate Bridges in this uninspired effort.  What's next?

As a bonus to watching a genuine five star Cohen brother's western, we get to see Jeff Bridges as Reuben ""Rooster"" Cogburn.  Bridges is as an actor that just seems to get better and better with time.  His recent turns as a serious dramatic actor have placed him at the tippity top of the short list of modern American actors who are among the very best in the world at their craft.  He consumes the character of Cogburn entirely and dominates every frame he is in, but still finds himself in a worthy threesome that includes Texas Ranger La Boeuf (Matt Damon), a quirky but effective bounty hunter wielding both a sharp nerdy tongue and a powerful Sharps carbine rifle.  The other character that matches these two is played by a hugely talented 14 year old actress named Hailee Steinfeld as the film's primary heroine.  She's the resourceful beyond her years Mattie Ross, and her along with her lovable horse Blackie force True Grit to be something beyond an immaculate and beautiful Cohen brothers' showdown at high noon.

Mattie Ross essentially wants revenge against a man named Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin) and she wants the meanest U.S. Marshall to help track him.  She looks to enlist Rooster Cogburn and it just so happens that Chaney is wanted for another crime in Texas, so Mr. La Boeuf is on his trail as well.  Mattie does everything she can to take part in hunting Chaney down and in the process proves an effective ally in her own way.  The bunch encounter numerous enemies including Barry Pepper's enjoyable villain Lucky Ned.  Like most Cohen brother's movies this could be about nothing at all and we would find the characters and style so rich and intriguing that it would be nearly impossible to not enjoy every minute.  True Grit is more than that as there is not only something to be said for the story but something to be said for the way the story is presented as a piece of classic cinema.  It's not something the Cohen brothers have really done before but here they execute a true genre film with absolute perfection, and with their trademarks intact, and only muted enough perhaps to keep the uninitiated in their seats.

There's been some Oscar buzz surrounding True Grit and there should be.  I'm surprised some critics have dissented.  All three major performances could see nominations; so could the cinematography, screenplay adaptation, and direction.  The accolades are deserved and as much as I hate rooting for any movie to actually make money, its nice to see this one doing alright as opposed to most of the garbage us movie-goers have had to sit through in 2010.  I can't recommend True Grit enough.  It is one of the year's very best films.",1293667200,6,3303,5.207939508506616
4202249,5,B003UESJME,"I don't think anyone can ever really be Rooster Cogburn except the original John Wayne.  That being said, Jeff Bridges is really wonderful in this role.  He's a grittier and nastier version of Rooster.  Matt Damon is so much better than Glen Campbell was in the role of the Texas Ranger, and the young girl who plays Mattie is an absolute revelation.
The Coen brothers have remade a classic and iconic film, and this remake will itself become a classic I am sure.  It's realistic, dirty, violent and harsh, as life really was for people who lived in the ""wild west"" during that time.  But it also has at its heart the story of young Mattie whose unwavering devotion to her father and true grit of her own lead us all on an unforgettable adventure.
This movie gives us a little more of an ending than the original even showing the grown up Mattie and letting us know what became of Marshall Cogburn.

4202250,5,B003UESJME,"Walking out of the theatre, a man behind us said (referring to Jeff Bridges):

""He wasn't John Wayne!""

And I turned to my companions and said:

""No he wasn't John Wayne, he was Rooster Cogburn!""

And that is my take on the Coen's re-imagining of Charles Portis's True Grit.  I think this is a terrific film, beautiful to look at, beautifully acted by all, and loaded with the arch and arcane dialogue that made the book a delight and had me chuckling throughout the story and this presentation particularly. I think the Coens nailed it.

It has been 40 plus years since I read the book, so I cannot attest how closely or how much the two films departed from the book.  But I do know that this version feels more true to the tone and tenor of the book I read so long ago, and the ending is more how I recall the novel ended.

Roger Deakin's cinematography is alway exceptional, but I think here it is superlative.  The cold and forbidding landscape he shoots is a perfect match to the somber tale that underlays the humorous dialogue and indelible characters that are young Mattie and her gun-for-hire and eventual protector and saviour, the reprobate and dissolute Deputy Marshal, ornery and mean and not too concerned with the niceities of the law, Reuben (Rooster) Cogburn, indelibly played in the original as the iconic John Wayne character by John Wayne, and in this re-discovered by Jeff Bridges in a role he owns as his own.

And of course there is the wonder of young Hailee Steinfeld (a real find), whom everyone seems to find astonishing in her confidence and command at 13 years old of a starring role with a lot of difficult dialogue and plenty of nuance in the complexity of her character.  This film is much more centered on Mattie and this young girl handles the chore with aplomb.

All of the supporting roles, from Matt Damon's Texas Ranger to the small cameos Josh Brolin and Barry Pepper as villains Tom Chaney and Lucky Ned Pepper are fine.  And even if the bit with the ""doctor"" wearing the bear coat wasn't in the book as some reviewer noted (I can't remember), I for one found that bit of aside not a distraction but a nice bit of Coenesque ""color"" thrown in for the pure quirkiness but absolutely in tune with the tone of the piece as a whole.

Anyway, many reviews here give lots of detail on the film so I will pass on that.  Let me just say that I think both films can be enjoyed for their strengths.  In the first, you have the incomparable Duke Wayne.  In the second, you have a completely realized film, with outstanding performances by the two leads, Steinfeld and Bridges as Mattie and Rooster, and a better script, cinematography, cast and direction.

And if the debate continues about which film is better, my view is this:  take John Wayne out of the first film and would it be a great film?  No.  Take Jeff Bridges out of the new version (God Forbid) and you would still have a fine film.  With Jeff in it as Rooster, I think you have a great film.  That's my 2 cents.",1293580800,11,3004,4.451553930530165
4202251,5,B003UESJME,"""True Grit"" (2010) is brilliant! This is how the story goes: Fourteen-year-old Mattie Ross's father has been shot in cold blood by the coward Tom Chaney, and she is determined to bring him to justice. Enlisting the help of a trigger-happy, drunken U.S. Marshal Rooster Cogburn, she sets out with him -- over his objections -- to hunt down Chaney. Her father's blood demands that she pursue the criminal into Indian territory and find him before a Texas Ranger named LeBoeuf catches him and brings him back to Texas for the murder of another man.

The cast led by Jeff Bridges (superb as Rooster Cogburn), Matt Damon (as LeBoeuf), Josh Brolin (as Tom Chaney) & Hailee Steinfeld (in a star-making performance as Mattie Ross) is brilliant! The screenplay (based on Charles Portis' novel) & directing by Joel & Ethan Coen (both of them also produced & film edited as Roderick Jaynes) is brilliant!

The music by Carter Burwell (who, recently did the music to ""The Kids Are All Right"" (2010) & has done the music to all the Coen Brothers movies) is brilliant! The cinematography by Roger Deakins (who also did the cinematography to ""The Company Men"" (2011) & has done the cinematography to all the Coen Brothers movies, with the expectation of ""Burn After Reading"" (2008), since ""Barton Fink"" (1991) is brilliant! The casting by Ellen Chenoweth (who also did the casting to the upcoming ""Men In Black III"" (2012) & has been doing the casting to the Coen Brother movies since ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" (2000), Jo Edna Boldin (who also did the casting to ""The Missing"" (2003), ""Terminator Salvation"" (2009), the upcoming ""Paul"" (2011) & ""Fright Night"" (2011) & Rachel Tenner (who also did the casting to ""A Serious Man"" (2009, which was directed, produced, written and film edited by the Coen Brothers) is brilliant! The production design by Jess Gonchor (who also did the production design to ""Fair Game"" (2010) & the upcoming ""Moneyball"" (2011) & has been doing the production design to the Coen Brothers movies since ""No Country For Old Men"" (2007) is brilliant!

The set decoration by Nancy Haigh (who also did the set decoration to the upcoming ""Moneyball"" (2011) & has done the set decoration to the Coen Brothers movies since ""Miller's Crossing"" (1990) is brilliant!

This is a brilliant film that keeps you thinking and on the edge of your seat at the same time. This is a well-made western that is one of the best westerns in a while. This is one of the best films of the year. The Coen Brothers are on a superb roll with well-made movies that keep you entertained and interested.

4202253,4,B003UESJME,"There's a scene in both versions of ""True Grit"" in which Deputy Marshall Reuben J. ""Rooster"" Cogburn tells fourteen-year-old Mattie Ross about his ex-wife and his son, who he hasn't seen in years and expects to never see again. As portrayed by John Wayne in the original 1969 version, we see an actor delivering his lines. As portrayed by Jeff Bridges in the 2010 remake, we listen to his garbled, drunken inflections of speech and realize that he's the full embodiment of Rooster Cogburn - gruff, past his prime, merciless, and trigger-happy. He's not a romanticized Western archetype, but a cantankerous, battle-scarred old man, one who has put on a few too many pounds and lost a few too many years of his life to alcohol. There is decency in him, although he's not a sentimental fool.

Adapted from the novel by Charles Portis, ""True Grit"" is in some ways a typical Coen Brothers movie, especially in the way it finds humor in a thoroughly humorless situation. In other ways, it's not like a Coen Brothers movie at all; although they have been known for paying homage to genre films (""Blood Simple,"" ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" ""Intolerable Cruelty""), they rarely adhere so strongly to convention. They instead opt to add their own highly eccentric spin on the subject, usually in the form of off-the-wall characters and bizarre events. This has worked beautifully before, but in the case of ""True Grit,"" they made the right decision by sticking to convention. This is a western through and through, and it's precisely because of that that the film is a modern day classic.

Taking place in Arkansas during the late 1800s, the center of the story is Mattie Ross (Haliee Steinfeld), who looks vaguely like Wednesday Addams and, despite being a teenager, has the financial knowhow of an accountant and the bargaining skills of a Turkish vendor. She's also a young woman of high standards and tremendous determination; when her father is murdered and robbed by one of his hired hands, Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin), Mattie vows that he will be caught and made to pay for his crimes. She asks about the best U.S. Deputy Marshall around and, after hearing several names, decides on Rooster Cogburn (Bridges), who has a reputation for being merciless. In Mattie's eyes, he has ""grit."" Old, drowning in alcohol, and saddled with only one eye, Rooster eventually consents to her requests, although he has no intention of taking her along. This is something the tenacious Mattie refuses to accept.

Here enters La Boeuf (Matt Damon), a Texas Ranger sent to arrest Chaney on the charge of murder. His character is introduced in a moment so wonderfully clich, it deserves recognition: As he sits in a chair on porch with his feet propped up on the railing and his hat tilted downwards, he lights a match and starts puffing away on a pipe. He thinks he should team up with Rooster, since he knows the Indian territory Chaney is hiding in. Mattie doesn't want him to tag along, mostly because she would rather Chaney be hanged for her father's murder than for someone else's. She doesn't get her way; La Boeuf is a part of the team. As the three travel across the wintery landscapes of Arkansas, they must face a number of obstacles, including Rooster's intended target, ""Lucky"" Ned Pepper (Barry Pepper), the leader of an outlaw gang Chaney is believed to be associated with.

Although it may be blasphemous to say that Jeff Bridges gives a better performance than John Wayne, the simple fact is that Jeff Bridges gives a better performance than John Wayne. Consider a scene in the remake in which Rooster, loaded on whiskey, repeatedly shoots at cornbread he flings into the air; we don't see a western archetype but a broken man with a desperate need to prove himself. At that moment, he seems the most human. We may laugh at his drunkenness, but we're more inclined to feel sorry for him. I cannot think of a single scene in the original ""True Grit"" that displays this level of emotional resonance. Wayne was effective at making Rooster an antihero typecast, although he never made that character-to-audience connection, in all likelihood because of his distinctive monotone voice.

The film itself, while telling virtually the same story as the 1969 film, is darker, edgier, and, in many instances, funnier. You might even say that it has ""grit."" The Coen Brothers do a fantastic job capturing the atmosphere of a western - the hard-boiled characters, the wild landscapes, the shootouts - while at the same time adding touches that heighten the material. Case in point: The moment Mattie climbs a tree and cuts down a corpse hanging from a rope. There's also the moment Mattie finally comes face to face with Chaney, who's now even more paranoid and pathetic than ever. ""True Grit"" is an absorbing, engaging, and thoroughly entertaining film, one of the few remakes that can be embraced on its own terms.",1293494400,9,4895,4.822619047619048
4202254,4,B003UESJME,"True Grit, as told by The Coen Brothers, is maybe the best western since Unforgiven. The way the complex dialogue was written reminded me of HBO's Deadwood. The story is really just a basic revenge tale, but the three lead actors and clever dialogue are what makes it interesting.

Jeff Bridges is once again in a role that he seems to be living, rather than pretending to inhabit. You can't understand half of what he says, but that's part of his realistic appeal and what subtitles are made for once it comes out on DVD. Matt Damon turns in one of his best performances, but I still can't shake the thought of that it's just Matt Damon dressed up like a cowboy. I do like the banter between him and Bridges. For my money, the real star of the show is newcomer Hailee Steinfeld. This 14-year-old actress blew me away with her great line delivery and tough attitude. She's got a real chance at the best supporting actress Oscar. Oh yeah, Josh Brolin has his name on the poster, but he's barely in the movie.

I was real close to bumping this up to five stars, but it just didn't blow me away. After seeing it was one of the best overall reviewed films of the year, I was hoping for more than just your standard western fare, but the crisp writing and high level acting made up for the lack of vision.

If you haven't yet, check out the remake of 3:10 to Yuma from a few years back. Since then we have gotten next to nothing from this once popular genre. Bring on more quality westerns like this and people will show up.",1293494400,4,1519,4.32280701754386
4202285,5,B003UESJME,"..In 1969 and 1975 anti-hero Marshal Rooster Cogburn was portrayed by John Wayne. Cogburn is portrayed as an anti-hero,  a breakout from the typical strait-laced hero Wayne normally played. It earned the Duke his only Oscar for the first of the two movies.  I hope history, repeats itself in this 2010 film remake. Jeff Bridges' Cogburn is perhaps an even more perfect a portrayal of the blustering character created by Charles Portis in his 1968 novel. Perhaps, closer to the original story overall in this adaptation has murderer Tom Chaney hunted by a 14-year-old farm girl who means to capture her father's killer with the aid of the toughest U.S. marshal she can find.  The Marshal is a man with ""true grit, never having had a dry day in his entire life.""  The two are joined by Texas Ranger LaBoeuf, played with just a pinch of bumbling by Matt Damon, who wants Chaney for a large Texas bounty. The mismatched trio find snow, snakes and surprises on the journey, and each has their ""grit"" tested in typical Coen Brother fashion.",1293321600,2,1034,4.727777777777778
4202286,3,B003UESJME,"A Coen brothers update to an old movie chestnut should have been a slam dunk. Their ""True Grit,"" while a fine movie, fell far short of our family's expectations. The remake did improve two characters from the first that were thoroughly irritating: Glen Campbell's nancy-fied LeBoeuf and Kim Darby's cringe-inducing Mattie. At least the Coens made these two characters tougher, if not completely believable. OTOH, Jeff Bridge's was completely believable as the broken down, hard-drinking old lawman, Reuben Cogburn. His lines were mumbled and wise, and he was believable as a man who knew his way around the frontier. The Coens did manage to dirty up frontier characters, giving them bad teeth, dirty faces, stringy hair and other accouterments of life in ramshackle cabins. But impressive makeup does not a good movie make.

The film's plot was full of interesting but disconnected asides -- including a bear-clad man with a hanged corpse on his saddle and a couple of passive, deformed Indian kids whom Cogburn kicked around for no apparent reason. Lack of context was the film's greatest handicap. What made Hattie so sanctimonious? Why was LeBoeuf, self-described as a hardened Texas Ranger, so innocent? Where did the description ""true grit"" come from? If you're not a Civil War fanatic, who is Captain Quantrill, under whom Cogburn served? A little less fidelity to the book and  a little more to the contemporary audience would have been appreciated.

The lack of conversation in my family after watching the movie pretty much said it all. Not a bad movie, but one that left us unmoved and dissatisfied.",1293321600,7,1609,5.064150943396227
4202287,5,B003UESJME,"This is a very good remake of the John Wayne classic. Jeff Bridges does an outstanding job and the young girl, Hattie Steinfeld, that plays the part of Mattie Ross is much better than Kim Darby in the original.

4202288,5,B003UESJME,"14-year-old Mattie Ross has come to Ft. Smith Arkansas sometime during the ""old west"" to hire a US Marshall to track and bring to justice the man who shot and killed her father.  She hires the man she's been told has true grit, Reuben ""Rooster"" Cogburn, a one-eyed drunk with a ferocious reputation.  They set out for the Indian Territories, accompanied, to their chagrin, by the dandified Texas Ranger LeBoeuf.  Along the way, they encounter some strange characters and engage in dangerous and bloody adventures.

This, in a tiny nutshell, is the story of TRUE GRIT, the Coen Brothers take on the famous novel (rather than a remake of the John Wayne original).  It's a fairly simple story, and to be honest, much of it is predictable.  Will the irascible drunk shake himself out of his stupor long enough to take on the job?  Will his initial dislike of the young, smart-mouth Mattie turn to respect and affection?  Will the three reluctant companions find grudging value in each other?  Will there be blood?

In many ways, the Coens have made their most commercially accessible dramatic movie.  While it is full of their usual quirkiness, it all lends itself to add mood and authenticity (for example, the rococo and florid language everyone uses would on paper seem hard to believe, no doubt.  But it adds to the feeling of time and place in remarkable ways).  You don't need to grasp around for meaning (as in the mundane ending of FARGO or the abrupt conclusion to NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN).  TRUE GRIT is a period piece with authentic looking sets, costumes and locations (much of it filmed in New Mexico, as was NO COUNTRY).  It is full of bloodshed, in the usual blunt, brutal, graphic style of the Coens (when someone is killed in a Coen brothers movie, there is never anything satisfying about it...we feel the life going out of the person, along with their aspirations, loves and longings).  It is also full of many funny moments, primarily in the extremely tart and intelligent dialogue.  It's one of the loveliest sounding films of the many years.

One of the earliest Coen Brothers movies was MILLER'S CROSSING.  It could have been a commercial movie, except at the time, period pieces about gangsters were not much in vogue.  The dialogue was nearly as fancy as in TRUE GRIT.  There was plenty of violence (including a stunning shootout with Albert Finney).  But it starred Gabriel Byrne and Marcia Gay Harden.  Fine actors...but not movie stars.

In TRUE GRIT, the Coens have turned again to Jeff Bridges (from their cult comedy THE BIG LEBOWSKI).  Bridges is enjoying a popular renaissance right now, and just looking at a photo of him as Cogburn tells you he's going to give an iconic performance.  So the part is perfect for Bridges, and the times are perfect for the public to flock to see him.  His Cogburn is certainly Oscar-worthy (as was Wayne's performance, which won the award).  He looks great...both terrifying and a little silly.  But in young Hailee Steinfield, who plays Mattie, he has found a perfect foil.  Steinfield gives an amazing and riveting performance.  This young lady has so much poise, so much intelligence and so much fire that she and her character light up the screen and nearly steal all their scenes.  Steinfield makes Mattie entirely a girl of her time.  She goes into the wild and sees and endures horrible things, yet never complains...in part because she's got grit of her own, but also because in the time of the movie, kids already understood that life could be short, painful and unattractive...and that death could be too.  We do occasionally see Mattie scared, but mostly we see her innate acceptance.  It's a fabulous performance and Bridges seems delighted to have such a great co-star to spar with.  The two develop their bond so easily, we hardly notice it happening.  Matt Damon, whose part is smaller, is something of comic relief...but he has his own reserves of fire and when the three are together, he does not detract but rather enhances the film.  I wouldn't say his performance is on the same level as the other two, but he's very fine indeed, and it's nice to see him join his buddies George Clooney and Brad Pitt as a Coen Brothers actor.  I suspect it won't be his last time.

TRUE GRIT, at least as presented here, is a study of the high price of retribution.  The idea of simply chasing a killer down and bringing him to deadly justice seems straightforward.  But what I suspect drew the Coen's to the material is the high price that is paid, both physically and spiritually, for this ""simple"" justice.  Grit is earned at a fairly high price.

TRUE GRIT is hugely satisfying and entertaining.  The ending is a little threadbare (I believe that comes from the source material)...but otherwise, it is a thing of harsh beauty.  The camerawork and editing are impeccable.  The costumes are appropriately dirty, and reflect the hygiene of the day.  All the supporting cast (notably Barry Pepper) are excellent.  And the Coen Brothers aesthetic has been stretched (but not broken) in pleasing ways.  Because the film is so accessible, one might assume going in that the Coen's have ""sold out.""  Nothing could be further from the truth...the film has their distinctive hallmarks all over it, and this only makes the film better.  I saw the film on Christmas Day (in a sold-out theater).  It's not exactly upbeat holiday fare.  But if seeing great films puts you in a cheery mood, then TRUE GRIT leave you feeling very fine indeed.",1293321600,9,5496,4.75369978858351
4202289,2,B003UESJME,"I cannot think of a film that I have found so disappointing. Jeff Bridges sounds like Beetlejuice after a few drinks.  He does nothing other than growl and mumble into his beard for the entire film - you can barely understand a word he says.  And he looks like he's hiding behind his over sized eye-patch (a prop that is NOT in the novel; Rooster's bad eye simply remains closed).  With the exception of the ending this film version of Charles Portis' great novel is not the faithful adaptation that the Coen brothers promised.  They have introduced new scenes, distorted other scenes, added additional dialog and inserted pointless characters that do nothing to advance the story; the bizarre ""doctor"" wearing the bear skin is a prime example.  Much praise has been lavished on unknown actress Hailee Steinfeld for her performance as Mattie Ross.  What performance?  Her horse has a more commanding screen presence.  Matt Damon is a great actor, but in this film you wouldn't even know he's in the movie if not for how loud his spurs jingle.

This is another prime example of how lackluster Hollywood's films of 2010 have been.  It promises much and doesn't deliver.  Why did they even bother making this movie?  It brings nothing new to the Western genre.  Fail.",1293321600,17,1264,4.796296296296297
4202290,5,B003UESJME,"The Coen brothers showed their own brand of true grit, going against all common sense by remaking the classic movie, ""True Grit"", and in the process, the Coens earned their spurs in delivering a film that is clearly one of the best of 2010. This is not your parent's version of the 1969 version starring John Wayne (and I consider it an excellent movie).  On the contrary!  The Coen's ""True Grit"" is more true to the book (author Charles Portis), has much better acting performances from the major stars, and keeps the viewer's interest from beginning to end with a ""gritty"" western story that unwinds with equal portions of suspense, drama, and humor.

The key to any successful movie is the storyline and casting of the major characters.  If the story is believable and tells an interesting tale, the addition of the right actors and actresses, the right music to set the mood, and firm direction make the movie truly special.  ""True Grit"" is all of this and much more.

Clearly, Hailee Steinfeld steals every scene she is in, and must be considered a favorite for best supporting actress of the year.  She nails Portis' ""Mattie Ross"" with a dead-on performance.  Steinfeld is Mattie Ross!  How she does this at thirteen years herself is amazing.  She captures every mood, every expression, every nuance perfectly.  The entire premise of the movie hinges on the very words the movie begins with:  ""People do not give it credence that a fourteen year-old girl could leave home and go off in the wintertime to avenge her father's blood..."".  Yet because Steinfeld so perfectly captures the essence of Mattie Ross, the viewer is lassoed and the adventure is on.  Steinfeld is the star of this show hands-down. Steinfeld's Mattie Ross is the heroine of this superb movie.

Playing the role of the ""greasy, vagabond, drunkard, and notorious thumper"", Deputy Marshal Reuben ""Rooster"" Cogburn, is Academy Award winner Jeff Bridges.  Bridges' performance is also Oscar worthy.  He plays Cogburn exactly as Portis envisioned him.  Bridges the actor completely disappears behind the eye patch and unkempt whiskers of the marshal with ""true grit"".  Bridges is Cogburn as much as Steinfeld is Mattie Ross.

Rounding out the excellent cast is Matt Damon as Texas Ranger LeBoeuf (pronounced ""LaBeef"").  Damon appears at ease clanking around in his ""great brutal spurs"", comfortable as the pompous self-adoring antagonist that rubs Cogburn the wrong way.  The dialogue between LaBoeuf, Ross, and Cogburn is witty, terse, and funny.

The movie can be appreciated on many levels.  It can be viewed purely as entertainment through the story, characters, and the acting performances.  The movie can also be appreciated for the more subtle themes that undercurrent the film.  For example, who (or what) is the movie named for?  All three main characters show their grit throughout the film.  Cogburn is depicted as a boozy, one-eyed bushwhacker who lives without any regard for others.  Yet, when he sees two boys torturing a mule, he frees the mule and punishes the boys with swift kicks to their rear-ends.  Conversely, Cogburn later brutally abuses Ross' horse when he races on its back to save Mattie's life.  The relationship between Mattie Ross, Marshal Cogburn, and LaBoeuf also deserves attention.  Both men disregard Ross as a mere child early on, but later come to respect her (""You've earned your spurs""), and in Cogburn's case, develop a  paternal protective love for her as well.  Real people are rarely all good or all bad; we are instead a complex mixture of both.  Indeed, to the Coen's credit, their characters cannot be painted with a single brush stroke.  Even the chief outlaw in the story, Lucky Ned Pepper, spares Mattie's life when he could have easily done worse.

The Coens sought to make their version of ""True Grit"" more true to the book, and for the most part they succeed.  This version is darker, less light-hearted, more serious, and more gritty than the 1969 version.  For those who have read the book, there are definite departures and many deletions from Portis' narrative.  For example, in the movie, LaBoeuf's role is changed appreciably.  He abandons his partnership with Cogburn and Ross midway through the movie, (an invention of Coen's screenwriter(s), yet returns to save the day near the end.  For the most part, the departures from the book do not significantly alter the plot line.

For thosewho never read the book the omissions and departures will not be noticed.  For those who have seen the 1969 version, the ending will be a great surprise (again, true to the book).

I applaud the Coens for delivering a western that tells a great story, has wonderful casting and acting performances, and is visually beautiful.  There are scenes that are breathtakingly beautiful!  This movie was wonderfully filmed!  It contrasts the stark beauty of the West with the murder and violent acts of its characters.

While this film won't singlehandedly revive the nearly dead American West genre, it certainly earns its place among many other fine western films.  The movie theatre audience I was in appreciated the film enthusiastically.  I recommend this film (and the book),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/True-Grit/dp/159020459X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">True Grit</a>&nbsp;to viewers over age twelve.

And no country for old men was well written, but the ending left me angry. This film plays like a  spaghetti/western/comedy believe it or not. Jeff Bridges doesn't even try to be John Wayne, instead he plays the part like a skilled comedian ,but treads softly enough with the jokes so as not to become cartoonish. All throughout the movie, they play differant versions of leaning on the everlasting arms. Which is a interesting foil to the violent story unfolding on screen. The only complaint I have is Matt Damon, who I usually like is very annoying, and I kept wishing his character would die already. I smell an oscar nomination or two for Bridges or the very BRILLIANT young Ms. Steinfeld,(Mattie Ross) I think is she plays her cards right,she could end up in the ranks of Meryl Streep.",1293235200,2,946,4.5588235294117645
4202292,4,B003UESJME,"True Grit is not a remake of the 1969 Henry Hathaway classic starring John Wayne. In interviews, the Coen Brothers have said they decided to return to the original source material i.e. the book by Charles Portis. As a result, it's a closer adaptation of the book. That's what sets this movie apart. People will make comparisons. That's alright, but they really are two different movies.

Jeff Bridges is extraordinary as the ""one eyed fat man"", US Marshall Rooster (Reuben) Cogburn. He's not Jeff Bridges doing an imitation of John Wayne. He has made the role of Rooster his own and it's worth its weight in California gold pieces. You can tell he's enjoying himself. He personifies the ""true grit"" that our hero, Mattie, feels is necessary to help her capture Tom Cheney. The man who murdered her father. In the original, the central character was Rooster Cogburn. Not so in this movie. It's Mattie Ross, as in the book.

Mattie is 14 years old and is determined to avenge the death of her father. She is certainly precocious and intelligent far beyond her years. And she is just as single minded as Rooster, except without the ornery attitude. Every time he tries to shoo her away, she doggedly returns to seek his help as well as roll his cigarettes. She will not be put off her task. Half the fun of this movie is watching Mattie outwit Colonel Stonehill for the funds she needs to pay Rooster as well as the costs of her father's funeral. Hailee Steinfeld plays Mattie as an intelligent, independent minded young woman who will not be treated like a child. She definitely holds her own on screen with Jeff Bridges as well as Matt Damon, Barry Pepper and Josh Brolin.

All the actors are wonderful. Matt Damon is marvelous as the nincompoop Texas Ranger, LeBouef (pronounced LeBeef) also after Cheney. At first, he seems like a ninny constantly being bested intellectually by Mattie. However, in the end, he too proves that he has true grit. As for Josh Brolin and Barry Pepper, can you get two better onscreen outlaws. Josh Brolin is fabulous as the villainous Tom Cheney. He's all snarling miscreant. While Barry Pepper is made all the more menacing with a mangled set of teeth and furry chaps.

This is a wonderful old fashioned type of western that Hollywood used to make and thanks to the Coen Brothers has been resurrected. The script is humorous, tight and witty. The one weak point is the ending. Towards the end, the script does seem to lose a bit of steam. However, do not let that stop you from seeing this movie. Yes, there is some violence. However, it is something you can take your 14 year old to see.

Go see this movie !! You will not regret it. I loved it. Now, I must read the book.",1293235200,5,2705,4.580578512396694
4202293,4,B003UESJME,"This 2010 version of ""True Grit"" is a worthy retelling of the novel by Charles Portis. It captures, in an authentically gritty way, the drama, suspense and even humor of the story of 14 year-old Mattie Ross, who sets out in mid-winter into post-Civil War Indian country in search of the low-life who murdered her father.

Mattie (well-played by Hailee Steinfeld) is brave beyond her years. She is accompanied by an aging one-eyed U.S. Marshal named Rooster Cogburn (Jeff Bridges), a tough, pitiless man who has worked both sides of the law. The pair are joined by Le Beouf (Matt Damon), a slightly fussy Texas Ranger with his own agenda. The three of theme will chase the shiftless Tom Cheney (Josh Brolin) to his hideout with bandit chieftain Lucky Ned Pepper (Barry Pepper).

Mattie sets the tone for the movie with her bravado performance in Fort Smith, as she somehow bullies an undertaker and a horse trader into doing business on her terms. The emotionally moving scene in which she dresses herself for the trip with her father's outsized clothing and gun is pitch-perfect. The slow rolling middle of the movie allows for Mattie and the lonely Rooster to strike up a friendship. The ending will load up the suspense, as Mattie finally confronts her father's killer.

Comparisons with the original 1969 movie starring John Wayne are perhaps inevitable, but this movie can stand on its own as well-done and entertaining; recommended.",1293148800,,1437,4.929752066115703

I don't like Westerns the same way I don't like Country Music.

So how did I get dragged out to seeing this?

After a long, tiring day, my wife informed me that we already had tickets. I figured if the movie failed to draw me in (I assumed it would) that I could just do what I normally do when I find myself unwittingly ticketed to a movie I don't really want to see--I would just sleep through it.

But as it turns out, I found myself watching 5 minutes . . . then 10 . . . and I was hooked by the time we got to the part where the guy with the eye-patch starting shooting off his witty dialogue in the courtroom.

Fantasy being one of my favorite genre's I likened Eye-Patch (can't for the life of me remember the character's name) to a witty Gandalf with a rifle. The main character also reminded me a little of Clint Eastwood's performance in Gran Turino.

The plot is pretty straightforward and there are fewer characters to keep track of than you have fingers . . . on one hand. I consider that a plus. The short but sweet action scenes also help keep the momentum going. In the end, though, I find it was the witty dialogue and antics of some of the characters that really kept me going . . . almost all the way to the end.

The end is where I feel the movie kinda fizzles out and loses steam. The ""big showdown"" was more of ""big letdown"", not as grand as it could have been. Sure, probably more realistic that way, but still. . . .

I have not read the book, nor seen the original movie, so I'll leave such comparisons like those up to the genre experts, but if you want the opinion of someone who mostly lives and breathes SF and Fantasy, then I can safely recommend this movie to those of you that may still be skeptical.",1293062400,2,1747,4.132743362831858

8405921,3,B003UESJME,Having grown up with the original True Grit.  I don't think this is as good.  It is more of it's own movie and not just a shot for shot remake like say Psycho.  And there are some things in it that the original didn't have.  Jeff Bridges switches the eye patch to the other eye.  Like he is trying not to be the John Wayne charactor.  And Hailee does a better job as Mattie Ross. And I thought Glen Campbell was better then Matt Damon who was too whiny and annoying.  If i want to watch True Grit i will watch the original first.,1524700800,,529,4.028846153846154
