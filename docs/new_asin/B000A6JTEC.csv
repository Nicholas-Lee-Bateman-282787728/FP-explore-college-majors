8074970,4,B000A6JTEC,"Waaaaay back in high school (early 90's) I would do this workout every day, with the water-filled equipment that came along with it. It was an easy and fun, low-impact workout that I could do in my bedroom without disturbing my parents! And my arms got REALLY defined, it was so great. Now I wish I could find the whole system again (I could get the VHS transferred to DVD) since I'm in my 40's and could use the arm definition again!",1390521600,,434,4.304878048780488
8074971,4,B000A6JTEC,"This VHS tape is part of the Hydrobics exercise program, which was sold in the early 90's. It's great for someone like me, who already has the water filled exercise equipment used in this program. My old videotape wore out, very happy to get a chance at this late date to replace it. However, for someone without the equipment who buys the tape, you'll have to improvise, maybe use some water bottles as a replacement for the ""Hydroburner"" and ""Hydrohands"" equipment used in this program.",1378771200,,488,4.752941176470588
