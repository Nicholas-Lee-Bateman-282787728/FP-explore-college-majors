7835147,5,6303037623,"Bernadette: Princess of Lourdes illustrates an important event in Church history and inspires children with the wonderful role models of Bernadette Soubirous, her family and parish priest. The story is moving and  beautifully animated. Humble Bernadette receives a message of conversion  for the world from a heavenly lady. Despite opposition from civil  authorities, the message is confirmed by miracles of healing and  conversion.  The story is told simply enough for children as young as 3  years old.  In fact, even my 2 1/2 year loved it and came running excitedly  to tell me about ""the lady! the lady!"".",960940800,8,610,5.153061224489796
