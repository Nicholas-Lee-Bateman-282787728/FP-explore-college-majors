8322988,1,B001N2WJ4O,"I bought this collection because it has all the Full Metal Panic! seasons, including Fumoffu. However, the spindle packaging makes it impossible to ship, store, or take out the discs without damaging them severely. When I first opened this set, I saw that half the discs were loose and scratched. The other discs had some kind of residue from being stored on top of each other - the cover imprinted on top of the discs left residue on the bottom surface of the discs. The price is cheap, but you get what you pay for. Unfortunately, I had to return this set to the seller because of the manufacturing defect in their spindle cases. Anime collectors will have to purchase each season of this great show individually or as separate discs.",1331942400,,736,4.625954198473282
8322989,5,B001N2WJ4O,"Bought the whole series for my gf who is very addicted to this anime.  Anime is great, enjoyed the cheesy comedy the main characters which their relationship reminds me of my own. If you love the Gundam series you would love this, even though there's only 3 seasons.",1276387200,,266,4.541666666666667
8322990,3,B001N2WJ4O,"Summary:  If you just want to watch the series in a non stop marathon without frills or extras, it's probably one of the best packages around.  If you are a die-hard fan or paraphernalia collector and want something that is not only filled with the episodes you've come to love but has exceptional and secure packaging, I would consider other options if available.

Normally I am pretty laid back when it comes to personal reviews.  Well, now it is time to get serious.

I am a long time manga/anime collector (in fact I'm finishing my FMP graphic novel set this year finally and have quite a few other LE items from the series from many years back) so I was highly disappointed with the presentation of this box set especially since I normally do not pay $$ for DVD sets in general and this was my first real one for an anime ever .  Normally, again I don't complain but for a 'box set' of 6 CDs  You would expect more secure casing so that your CDs do not get scratch damage over time.  Instead, I received  a sealed, cracked (while sealed! on the top and it has split further down the middle as it was carefully opened) hard plastic box casing where the CDs lay.  If anyone reading this tends to be a bit heavy handed with their collections (of which I am not) please be extremely careful with this casing.

I did have a chance to review the advertisement laden CDs which doesn't bother me so much since I can bear a few advertisements to support the company, but ADV, if you are reading this, a few more cents on your part and you would have gotten a clean 5/5 rating from me.  I was thoroughly satisfied with my Kadokawa TSR Complete series presentation, packaging and extras in contrast.  And yes, I am aware of the return program, but due to personal considerations and the fact that I like FMP as a series, the casing ultimately doesn't make the anime. So I will have to grin and bear instead of parting and waiting for another replacement with the same exact packaging.

So again, buyer be advised!

PS:  This review was give on the same day of receiving the item so please consider this review hot off the plate.",1256860800,2,2122,4.402564102564103
8322991,5,B001N2WJ4O,after watch 10  episodes on youtube i just had to have this. theres action drama and lots of good comedy.,1240704000,,105,4.25
8322992,4,B001N2WJ4O,"It isn't often I give 4 starts, in fact I don't think I have ever, but there was one thing that killed me with this. From the outside the case is nice, it is a simple 27mm 6 disc case. On the inside, it is 1 awful spindle that stacks the discs on top of each other. One of my biggest pet peeves is stacking discs. I hate it so much, I am actually ordering a second copy of Cowboy Bebop just to switch the cases, then pawn Cowboy Bebop for a few dollars but what a waste. Fortunately, most people don't have crazy bad OCD's like me.

Now then, on with review. This product is really great in my opinion because it puts 2 great, entirely different shows together in one nicely sized and priced case. There are 6 disc with 6 episodes on each. The first 4 contain the first season. I don't remember any special features other than trailers which is perfect by my standards. English and Japanese dub, though the English is alright, I'd suggest the Japanese dub. If you enjoy good stories with comedy added in them, this show is for you. I absolutely loved this show. Now for the other 2 discs, you got Fumoffu. I loved this show just as much as the first season, but in a whole other light. Even though it has the same characters, I consider it a completely different show. No story, just side splitting humor. These discs are the same as the others when it comes to features and languages.

So if you are looking for a solid collection, grab this box set. Though the case is annoying, it's overlook-able for the amazing quality of everything else.",1236470400,7,1543,4.317241379310345
