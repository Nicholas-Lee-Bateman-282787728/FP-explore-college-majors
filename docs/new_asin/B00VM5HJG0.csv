My strength, Our God reigns pushing back the darkness. In the name of Jesus, Covered & it's already done. Thank u God, thank u Israel.  Love it",1467504000,,306,4.5636363636363635

8710539,4,B00VM5HJG0,"I am a die hard Israel & New Breed fan, so much that I saw the movie when it was in theaters back in January.  If you saw it in the movies, you might be disappointed that none of the commentary and the discussion at the end of the premiere in the movies is on this DVD.  I would have preferred that the DVD had been exactly what I saw in the movies.  Oh well, I love the music and will still enjoy",1461628800,,397,3.7590361445783134

8710541,1,B00VM5HJG0,The music was very nice. What I didn't like on the DVD was that every few seconds the camara view changed. It was hard to enjoy the view for me. His other DVDs were not like this one. His other ones were great. If I would have known this I would have just ordered the cd.,1458259200,,271,3.857142857142857
