It was ridiculous fun, I couldn't help laughing aloud the entire time. Koizumi and Otani are adorable, along with their little quarrel for love. I reccomend it, its a great picker upper :)",1271980800,,351,4.415384615384616
3036735,5,B000YZ7UFO,"I really enjoyed the movie, I watch it once a week: sometimes more if I need a little pick-me-up after a particular hard day.",1268265600,,125,4.25
3036736,5,B000YZ7UFO,"Read the books, wasn't sure if the movie would be as good it was! When a tall girl falls in love with a short guy. Lots of hilarity breaks out!",1268092800,,143,3.8
3036737,5,B000YZ7UFO,"I thought this movie was hilarious, colorful, and cute.

I've seen the anime and had a lot of fun with that. The movie did attempt to fit a bit much, especially as it added a couple new elements (which weren't too bad), like the teacher trying out new wigs in the hope that his students wouldn't be able to tell he was wearing a wig. ...
It spent too much time on 'Mighty'-sensei and the basketball scene, but when I realized I couldn't take anymore 'let's go Mighty' it stopped.

Anyhow, the story line isn't anything special: tall girl (Risa) & short boy (Ootani) get along really well, but as both have pledged never to go out with anyone shorter/taller, and everyone calls them the comedy duo, they don't consider going out. Well, until they do. Girl goes after boy, switch, boy goes after girl, etc.

Despite the rather ordinary plot, the execution was brilliant. Little anime elements crept in, as when Risa realizes she likes Ootani, and little stars surround him. The actress who portrayed Risa was really cute, and managed the expressions surprisingly well. Her hair is even done the same (as in the anime).

I found it a lot of fun to watch, as did the other girls I was with. I have a feeling guys wouldn't enjoy it as much, but who knows.
I liked the colors, Risa's stubbornness, the playful atmosphere, and the Osakan dialect. I also thought it was charming how the narrator spoke in English (though I had to read the Japanese subtitles to understand part of what he was saying).
All in all, worth watching. I'm sure I'll watch it again, too.

Update 2016:
I finally bought this!! And watched it!! It's still super cute.",1238889600,,1633,4.559726962457338
3036738,5,B000YZ7UFO,I have never read the anime that this live action movie is based on since I'm not a huge anime fan but I tend to like these live action movies based on anime (death note is another one).  I can't speak for the accuracy or similarities because of that.  I also have a dvd with NO subtitles and have no idea what the characters are saying. Yet I still LOVED this movie. It was a complete visual experience. It's so colorful and fun.  Everything from what they eat (ice cream or drinks) to the main character's awesome room - is so pretty and colorful...I can't stress it enough. Ema Fujisawa (that main girl) is also impossibly adorable. The gist of the movie is the tall girl and short guy end up falling in love...that's all you really need to know about the story in my opinion.,1233273600,2,779,4.321917808219178
3036739,5,B000YZ7UFO,"This film isn't an adaptation of a great literay opus, sure, but it is a really fun, sweet movie to watch. There's plenty of drama and overacting, but, be honest, you aren't watching manga-based movies for the subtlety and deep insight into human nature. I rented this at first and liked it enough that I couldn't wait to add it to my collection.",1214524800,,346,4.507936507936508
3036740,3,B000YZ7UFO,"Definitely a movie that is cute and fluffy and fun, without much substance. To note is the cast full of rising stars, such as the two main characters. Koike Teppei has appeared in many dramas before, but it is Love Com that brings him to the big screen attention of international anime fans who don't watch Japanese dramas. Also in the film is Mizushima Hiro in one of his first roles in a film, and he's one to watch out for too, though neither boy gets anything particularly out of the formulaic character acting.

This is not a hard movie to make, but somehow the director drags it out too long with too many subplots--I feel like the rival situation at the end was just unnecessary as we all know what will happen in the end anyway. Still though, the entire movie is pretty funny, and worth a couple of hours of your time for a few laughs.",1212883200,2,843,4.3354430379746836
3036741,4,B000YZ7UFO,"If you happen to be a fan of the animation series ""Lovely Complex"", then i guarentee you'll love this. :)
It's absolutely corny and the acting isn't all that great--reminds me of the acting you usually find in a soap opera. But if you're looking for a good laugh and/or are curious to see how ""Lovely Complex"" would look like with real characters, then this is the ticket for you!
As far as the story goes, they did a pretty good job rounding up the main points of the whole ""Lovely Complex"" series into a movie. The characters are pretty close to those of the series, although not quite so extreme since it's hard to make a REAL person melt or survive getting beat up all the time like they do in the series. BUT! It still has that wonderful exaggerated corny anime love-comedy story feeling to it.
I thoroughly enjoyed it and recommend it to all ""Lovely Complex"" fans out there!!",1205193600,,881,4.444444444444445
3036742,4,B000YZ7UFO,"Love*Com, also known as Lovely Complex is a movie based on Aya Nakahara's hilarious romantic comedy manga. If you have not yet read the manga or seen the anime, I'd reccommend watching the movie first to be introduced into this series. I just feel that reading the manga or watching the anime will make the movie less enjoyable since I feel the manga and anime are superior. Neitherless, the movie was still a lot of fun to watch, though it was overexaggerated at some points (Suzuki-kun's character for example).

Love*Com is about Koizumi Risa, a girl who is 170cm tall and Ootani Atsushi, a boy who is only 152cm tall. The two are always bickering with each other and their teacher ends up pairing them up as a comedy duel. They have a bet aganist each other on who can find a boy/girlfriend first. However, Risa ends up falling for Ootani. How will their relationship end up?

The movie covers up until the basketball match aganist Maity-sensei for those who have seen the anime/read manga. One thing that disappointed me about the movie was the non-inclusion of Seiko's character and the appearance of Risa's sister who does not exist in the original manga. However the bickering between the two leads is still evident and many funny lines from the manga are used. Overall, the movie is a fun and very colorful ride. If you are a fan of the manga or anime I would give it a shot since it's a different take at a wonderful series. And if you are new to Lovely Complex I would still watch it as well. It might get you interested in the manga and anime which are both uber awesome.",1201910400,,1583,4.512195121951219
3036743,3,B000YZ7UFO,"Risa Koizumi is too tall for a girl.  Atsushi Otani is too short for a boy.  You know the rest.  Hijinks ensue.

Well, OK, it may not actually be that simple, but that is pretty much the gist of Love*Com (Which is a shortened form of ""Lovely Complex"", which doesn't have any real meaning besides being bad Japanese-English).  Based on a popular shojo manga, this is just a light and fluffy formula-romance comedy pairing two oddballs who are perfect only for each other.  The film follows the style of the manga, with sudden flights of anime-inspired fantasy interspersed with reality, and that is its saving grace, and where most of the charm comes in.

Formula films depend a lot on the abilities of their actors to save the day, and the cast of ""Love*Com"" does OK.  Most of them, including the leads, are pretty much inexperienced as actors, but that doesn't hurt them too much.  Model Ema Fujisawa playing Risa is cute in an odd sort of way, and fits the role perfectly.  Teppei Koike, a singer and ""idol"" is a little too cool as Atsushi, and it is hard to buy that he has a hard time finding a girlfriend. The film is absolutely peppered with cameos by popular Japanese comedians, but that probably won't mean much to too many Americans. Shizuyo Yamazaki (Sayuri from ""Hula Girls"") is funny as Risa's older sister, a giant girl in her own right but who managed to hook herself a man.

The films keeps up a good pace, but then fizzles near the end.  A problem with some manga adaptations, they tried to fit too much of the popular story in, and just when things should have been coming to their happy conclusion, a new rival steps in and the film drags.  You know what the eventual conclusion is going to be, and if the director had compacted the storyline a bit more, maybe thrown in some subplots with the other characters, it would have been a charming piece of film fluff, good for fans of the manga series and for anyone in the mood for this type of formula flick.  As it is....things just go on too long, even at barely over an hour and a half.

For this kind of light comedy, the DVD is actually surprisingly good, with interviews, fake music videos and a parody short film.  They did a good job padding out the content, and the US release actually has more bonus materials than the Japanese release.",1200960000,4,2311,4.466666666666667

The movie had cheesy parts in it that had me rolling on the floor laughing but it also had serious parts in it that had me holding my breath. The main guy character in this movie is one of the cutest actors ever, Teppei Koike, in it and he just makes it GREAT!! The movie also came with information about the actors, PV's (the Japanese equivalent of a music video), Trailers, and extra credits which were really funny and interesting to watch. This movie will leave you laughing and is a definite 'must see'.

Now, about the shipping and subtitles and stuff like that. The movie came in about one week or less which was a couple weeks before I was expecting it and so that was awesome!! The subtitles were really good. I have been learning Japanese for about 2 years and though I am just a beginner and I am not even close to mastering the language, I know enough of the language that I could tell that the subtitles were correct. The movie wasn't wrapped in bubble wrap or anything so I was slightly worried but it was in a good and sealed envelope/container thing and so the movie was completely safe.",1333843200,,1234,4.3652173913043475

The acting was not very good (Risa in particular was painful to watch), a lot of things were changed (some for the better, some for the worse), and a lot of it was very silly.

The film, however, did have its moments; the guy who plays Ohtani did a passable job, and when he kissed Risa at the end it was really cute, even though he didn't seem to be shy about it the way Ohtani in the manga would have been.

My favorite thing about this movie was Maity-sensei.  He was HILARIOUS, and they portrayed him perfectly with the sparkles and preening-but-kind perfection and all that.  The final ""battle"" between him and Ohtani was over-the-top, but still funny.

Overall, the movie wasn't great, but big fans of the manga or anime might want to see it anyway, and the movie's real saving grace was Maity-sensei.",1307232000,,931,4.4411764705882355
