8207071,3,6303029140,"This film is an adult comedy and not meant to be taken at all seriously. People who liked quirky movies such as ""The Big Picture"" (Kevin Bacon, Teri Hatcher) and ""Bodies, Rest, and Motion"" (Bridget Fonda, Eric Stoltz, Phoebe Cates) will probably appreciate this. The plot and production are not as good as in the other two, but it is extremely clever and funny, not to mention erotic. The characters are three-dimensional and believable, and there are plenty of smart lines that keep it interesting.",1153008000,,499,4.882352941176471
