2500608,4,B000E6EK3S,"Spectacular.

Having watched all three Harry Potter movies I couldn't help but wonder what was in store for the next. Harry had prevented Voldemort from returning to power twice. He had unknowingly been in the presence of one of his most loyal followers and now his fourth year commences with the promise of an amazing new event at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, the Triwizard Tournament. A special event held every couple of years from the great Wizarding schools of Europe to determine who is the best. Three schools and three wizards... until somehow Harry Potter has been chosen as the fourth member by some mysterious party.

Harry is honor bound to compete in a tournament that sets him apart from students of greater magical aptitude that him. He's younger, less qualified and even more importantly surprised to be entered at all, knowing full well this could be something even worse than he can imagine as he faces challenges that require death-defying courage and skill already.

This movie truly surprised me at how good this was done. I enjoyed the first two with Chris Columbus, the third with Alfonso Cuaron was a bit messy but Mike Newell sets things back on track. Movie feels British unlike the last movie. The soundtrack is just the most stirring and glorious sounding of the ones ever made and it surprised me that it wasn't done by John Williams. Patrick Doyle wrote an incredibly emotional score.

The movie itself is also well told. Screenwriter Steve Kloves cuts some of the fat from the novel and tells it much better than JK Rowling. Yet its still  incredibly ambitious with its scope and magnificent special effects and even more exciting action sequences. No Quidditch in this movie, but the Triwizard Tournament is wicked cool. Dragons, underwater creatures and a maze of terror. The drama is also wonderful, boys meet girls and long hidden truths are revealed. But none of that compares to the big surprise at the end of the movie.

Truly a great film. Glad to have it on Blu-Ray and Digital Copy.",1518220800,,2038,4.825214899713467

2501120,4,B000E6EK3S,We can all already agree the plot line in this is used with pure action sequences and performances. This installment is when the series gets really dark. Especially now that the dark lord has returned and Harry must face him in a first epic battle in a graveyard. but flawed in one scene that made me almost through up. In which the dark lord comes out of a pot with goo surrounding him which does look quite disturbing. And the fact that in some scenes you can tell that Harry's glasses don't have glass in them. But everything else in the film is great proof of a start to a darker future.,1495584000,,591,4.285714285714286

What you don't get: Big, weird packaging, ""collectible"" cards and photo books. There were some slightly more substantial DVD extras on the Hogwarts/Ultimate Editions. But between the two BD disc, you're getting 4-5 hours of extras already.

I like Harry Potter just as much as any other fan out there; however, I won't criticize the film too harshly as it was a director's attempt at capturing a huge story (the book is pretty thick) and compressing it enough so that the story is made clear (which I thought was a mess). I read the book first, so that's why I felt like the movie was chopped up and fast. A'lot of little things you get from the book WILL NOT be in the movie. I did love the cinematics and action, and some details I would of loved added from the book. Also, I do not like the new Dumbledore that replaced Richard Harris, to me he was a bit too rough in portraying Dumbledore. However, the big scenes (e.g. the graveyard) was executed really well! I liked the first two trials in the tri-wizard tournament, not so much the last (as I said before, the plot is CHOPPED). I wouldn't of cared if the director made the film five hours long, I would of loved every moment where the pacing would have been calmer. Nonetheless, if you watch the film and felt like things were missing--you're absolutely right. If you did read the books, hold your breath at how much was subtracted from the book itself (and of course, breathe afterwards...). I gave it a two star because to me, the movie was going too fast, I felt like the story was all over the place, character development was awkward in terms of the pacing. It felt more like a summary... If you're a die hard fan, watch at your own risk. If you don't read the books but just want to watch the movie--enjoy!",1475971200,,1566,4.293918918918919
2501788,5,B000E6EK3S,"This movie is great I now they left out the quidditch world cup and people are upset about it but I personally always felt that dragged on to long in the book. I think leaving out the house elves was a mistake due to their importance to the story and Dumbledore's yelling is out of place. But, I love all of the design aspects, this story has probably the biggest turning point in the whole series, and the casting for Barty Crouch Jr. was great.

2501806,5,B000E6EK3S,"I was a movie-watcher first, then went back to read the books, and I must say, anyone who down rates the movie because ""it wasn't as good as the book"" or ""it cut this thing I like"" is merely looking at it through bias glasses.

I love the movie, and I enjoy the books, but everything they cut from the books is completely understandable. We don't need a huge side track into Hermoine's SPEW, which amounts to nothing. We don't need a 15 minute segment of yet another quidditch match. True, the other tri-wizards are a tad underdeveloped, but seeing as we never meet them again, it's perfectly okay and doesn't add to the story.

The only thing that might have been nice was a bit of Hermoine teaching Harry the Accio spell, so that we understand where he got it for the Portkey later on. But, while it would have been a nice touch, it wasn't entirely necessary (though I would argue I'd rather see that than the ridiculous dragon scene).

And in fact, a lot is reworked and reordered in the movie to make a bit more sense, especially for viewing. The only thing that might go a bit too fast is the fact that the male school professor (forget his name) was a Death Eater, as he's the same one in the flashback, and later talking to Snape. It's kind of hard to catch, since he's kind of crazy and weird in the memory scene. But still, it's a minor point for the movie as he's not set up as a red herring.

Overall, the movies are wonderful adaptations of the books and even without the book knowledge are perfectly fine. You *do not* need all that extra ""background"" that is in the books to enjoy the movies, despite what people might say. IMO, Rowling wasn't the best author and really had way too much going on that, while okay filler for books, never amounts to much of anything.",1474848000,,1780,4.352409638554217

The movie was cleverly designed and well executed, and for the most part it closely followed the plot of the corresponding novel by J.K. Rowling. However, there were a few times where the differences between book and movie were very prominent, such as how the movie cut out the underlying  plot of Rita Skeeter's illegal Animagus discovery (by Hermione), and all of Rita's outrageous stories about Harry throughout the entire Triwizard Tournament. In addition, mere hours before Harry is subject to participating in the second task, the novel relates that it is Dobby the House Elf who advises Harry to use Gillyweed, whereas in the film version it is Neville. Overall, though, this movie is destined to become an adored classic, perfect for adults and kids alike.",1468972800,,922,4.910256410256411

He is beyond a doubt one of the scariest movie villains ever. Right beside Charles Middleton as Emperor Ming and Anthony Hopkins as Hannibal Lecter.  I'd like to give special credit to Jeff Rawle, Who played Amos Diggory, father of Cedric.

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!  This is fraud.  This is likely also a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act, and just bad business!!!!!!

The book is great.  The whole concept of the Tri-wizard Tournament was so good.  Love the special effects.

2502647,4,B000E6EK3S,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is perhaps the one movie that strays the furthest from the novel itself in regards to detail and plot. However, it has always been at the top of my list of favorite films. I believe that this is because Goblet focuses so intensely on the tasks of the Tri-Wizard Tournament that it becomes a true action film, fulfilling yet another cinematic genre alongside fantasy and detective.
 In order to allow everything from the 636-page novel to be squeezed into a mere 157 minutes, some detail obviously had to be omitted. Super fans may complain that crucial parts of the plot such as background detail regarding Barty Crouch and his family as well as Hermiones effort to improve the conditions of House Elves throughout the wizarding community were underplayed or not mentioned at all. While I would be more than enthusiastic had these scenes been incorporated, I also believe that there was just enough of everything to keep viewers truly interested and engaged. Omitting background information not essential for the forward process and understanding of the plot allowed for the film to remain accurate as well as pleasurable. Viewers may seldom find themselves confused whilst watching as the three different tasks develop in front of their very eyes.
 Incorporating new characters as well as never before seen settings into the world of Hogwarts, the screenwriters of Goblet did a fantastic job portraying this entirely new environment to their audience. In particular, the second task enthralls viewers as they are taken below sea level to explore and search alongside Harry and other contestants, allowing them to picture the depths of the lake in a more vivid experience than ever possible. In addition to new places, we also see new faces in the fourth installment of the series, one of the more significant characters being Mad Eye Moody. Brendan Gleeson does a terrific job of offering just enough unnatural characteristics to make viewers semi-suspicious of his intentions while remaining likeable until the final scenes of the film. His costume in particular displays exactly the roots of his character, with rugged boots and matted hair matching his wild personality and dark colors always presented to highlight the evil and unconventional character that his true self is. His (SPOILER) transformation at the end of the movie is delivered perfectly, surprising viewers and making them question as to how they had never spotted his unauthentic personality from the get go.
 Furthermore, for being a series told from the perspective of a teenage boy, Goblet does a particularly good job at drawing attention away from Harry in some moments to place emphasis on other characters and their roles. We see this primarily in the moments with the Pensieve where we are taken completely away from Harry (something that has never been done before in the Potter series) to view something that Dumbledore had witnessed at an earlier date. While Harry is viewing this alongside us, we are allowed for the first time to react to a situation without Harrys thoughts or actions biasing our opinions. This effect is created entirely by screenwriters as in the novel it does not have the same outcome. The lighting and sound in the Pensieve scene are also incredibly important as they murkily transport us to an alternate time and place, being small and insignificant in the background they continuously remind us that we are not viewing the wizarding world through present day eyes.
 Some critics argue that the movies were made for the present culture and since they often stray so far from the story line of the book, they are not made for fans. However, it is quite the opposite, the screenwriters outrageously transport us to a place that has only ever existed in our imaginations, Goblet specifically excels at this while maintaining the title of an overall wonderful movie as well.",1444867200,,3914,5.026194144838213

2502735,3,B000E6EK3S,"I remember when this book came out, and I was amazed that kids were lining up to read a 1000+ page novel!! (I have to admit I was right there in line with them), and while I read the novel, I kept wondering just how in the world they would ever be able to make a film adaptation. The novel is PACKED with tons of new characters, the Quidditch World Cup, the Tri-Wizard tournament.....just tons of stuff, and I thought for sure it would have to be split into two films. When I found out that ""Goblet of Fire"" was going to be a single film, with a running time similar to the earlier films in the series, I figured they would be cutting the story to the bone, and was prepared to be disappointed in the movie.

I will say that they story is cut way, way down. We go from the opening at the Riddle house to the Weasley household to the World Cup to Hogwarts within the first 10 - 15 minutes of the film. What took a few hundred pages in the novel takes up almost no screen time. The storytelling in the film is crisp and while huge sections of the novel are glossed over or left out completely, the film is very entertaining and coherent, but quite a bit of character building is lost in the process. The leads get their time to shine, but the supporting case doesn't get to do a whole lot. Snape is relegated to the background for most of the film, and Rickman's portrayal of the Potions Professor as been a highlight of the series so far. We don't really get to know the other competitors in the Tri-Wizard Tournament either, specifically Cedric Diggory. It's a shame that we can't really get invested in these characters as they play such a vital role in the overall story. The F/X again are top notch, and again the three leads really feel natural in the roles now, they've made these characters their own, and it shows.

I really think this film should've been split into two movies. There is just so much lost in the transition from Page to Screen, that while this film does feel complete, fans of the series know there was a much bigger, and better story to tell. As it is, ""Goblet of Fire"" is a good movie, but it's not a great movie.",1441238400,,2139,4.253071253071253

2502857,4,B000E6EK3S,"As an avid reader of the series I have high expectations for the movies.  I recently read through the series again and decided to watch the movies as well.  I remember being disappointed with the movies previously.  However this movie is the first one that has not been a complete disappointment.  I wanted to throw something at my tv after Prisoner of Azkaban.  Although this movie still leaves out a large chunk of the book's plot line it is still well done.  They managed to get the necessary things into the movie this time.  It is understandably difficult to fit everything into 2.5 hours and for this reason they did well. I still wonder how anyone who hasn't read the books can understand everything that is happening and not be confused, but overall the movie seemed to do a good job of moving the story along.  This was also the first movie in the series that I felt was highly entertaining.  The story moved well, it hit all the right emotions, and didn't stall in all the wrong places as some of the previous movies do.  The actors have improved dramaticallya and the budget is obviously bigger at this point, meaning that special effects are much more convincing.

2502858,5,B000E6EK3S,"""Dark and difficult times lie ahead, Harry."" These are the words of warning that Hogwarts Headmaster Albus Dumbledore gives Harry in his fourth film outing. But 'dark and disturbing' would be an apt descriptor for The Goblet of Fire, because here more than in any of the previous three, the powers of darkness are gaining strength and closing in on young Mr Potter and they mean to finish him. Goblet of Fire is great movie version of the book - sure they've had to chop loads out but it still manages to capture the spirit of the original and bring it vividly to life... For me this is where the Harry Potter films change from spooky children's fiction to supernatural adult fiction based in a children's world. It's by far the darkest one yet, stepping into real horror territory at points, with a sustained sense of menace and a gruesome climatic graveyard scene",1438214400,,865,4.660130718954249

2502892,3,B000E6EK3S,"The film adaptation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the fourth in the franchise, had both the unenviable task of following the ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" as well as bring to film how the series transitions from the lightheartedness of the earlier series to the darker themes to come.

Like it's predecessor, ""Goblet of Fire"" was boiled down to the essential plot and foreshadowing elements needed for future films, however until like it's predecessor it wasn't as well done given the amount of things that occurred in the book that related to one another.  The decision to focus on action given the events of the Triwizard Tournament is not the problem, it was the amount and quality that was and that took away from the narrative especially when it came to Voldemort's supporter within Hogwarts and the surrounding details connected to him.  The memories of the Pensieve are better executed in the film than in the book, though the clues they provide could be lost if you aren't paying attention.  The main cast of the film continued to grow as actors and the inclusion of Ralph Fiennes (Lord Vordemort) and Brendan Gleeson ('Mad Eye' Alastor Moody) provide perfect actors to portray their characters.

The fourth installment of the Harry Potter franchise is a good film, but there were missteps that stopped if from equally the quality of it's predecessor ""Prisoner of Azkaban"".

2502954,5,B000E6EK3S,"For me, 2005's ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is the best ""Potter"" movie in the series, and watching it again in this ""Ultimate Edition"" Blu-ray set only confirms the impression.

The first two installments in R.K. Rowling's ""Potter"" series were cute and charming in a whimsical sort of way, culminating in exciting battles and all, but they were largely juvenile entertainments befitting Harry's young age.  As Harry got older, the series got appropriately darker, with episode three, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,"" being very dark, indeed.  I liked the look of ""Azkaban,"" but it felt the most unfinished of the movies, like a mere transition, while the first two movies were fairly self-contained.  In other words, although episode three looked good, it didn't have a lot to say.  Then came ""The Goblet of Fire,"" and all the best elements of the ""Potter"" films came together.  The characters had matured, the tone and atmosphere were more serious, and the plot held together on its own.  I find the movie highly entertaining.

The biggest knock I've heard from naysayers about ""The Goblet of Fire"" is that it cuts out too much of the book.  Well, think about it:  The book is enormously long, and the movie is about two-and-a-half hours.  Something had to give, and I believe the screenwriter and director made the right decisions about what to keep and what to toss out.

OK, so we no longer have an opening episode with the Dursleys, Harry's horrid aunt, uncle, and cousin.  We can live without it as it offered up nothing new in the book, either.  Hermione has no crusade to free the house elves.  Again, no loss, since it was extraneous to the story.  The irritating, mean-spirited reporter, Rita Skeeter, shows up less often than she does in the book, as does Harry's godfather, Sirius; and there is little mention of giants.  Plus, there are any number of tiny details that Rowling herself could have cut from the book to begin with.  Face it, fans:  Rowling seems to be an excessively wordy author who got wordier as the ""Potter"" books went on.  She could have used a good editor, and the filmmakers probably did us a service trimming her material.

British director Mike Newell (""The Awakening,"" ""Four Weddings and a Funeral,"" ""Donnie Brasco"") and screenwriter Steve Kloves (who scripted among other things ""Wonder Boys"" plus the previous ""Potter"" films) have appropriately pared down Rowling's sprawling 734-page hardbound novel into its most basic story constituents. The movie opens as the book does, with Harry having a vision of dire foreshadowing, and then it dispenses with the usual business of Harry's home life with the Dursleys.  After all, we know that Harry has outgrown the Dursleys, and Hogwarts is Harry's real home now, so we shift immediately there and the Quidditch World Cup.

In this fourth installment, Harry has to face on the one hand his old nemesis, Lord Voldemort, determined to regain human form, and on the other hand an even bigger challenge--girls.  Let's concentrate on the Voldemort side.  It's time for the big Triwizard Tournament, a wizarding competition involving the best representatives of the three major wizarding schools in the world, and this year it's being held at Hogworts.  However, you have to be at least seventeen years old to enter, so Harry knows he has no chance.  If you're old enough, you throw your name into the Goblet of Fire, and the cup picks the best persons to compete; the goblet is kind of like the Sorting Hat, with a mind of its own.  Then something surprising happens.  Without entering his name in the competition, the Goblet chooses Harry along with another boy, Cedric Diggory, as Hogworts' representatives.  So Harry is in whether he likes it or not.

The competition involves contending in several events with dragons and underwater rescues and mazes and such, but more important to our story is that Voldemort wants to use this contest to lure Harry to his death.  It seems that only Harry's blood can help restore ""He Who Must Not Be Named"" to human form, and despite Dumbledore's best efforts to protect Harry, Voldemort is keen to grab him and do him in just the same.

The contests themselves are fun to watch, imaginative and exciting.  Harry's interrelationships with his friends Ron and Hermione are more complex than ever, with mistrust and jealousies running amuck.  Harry's evening at a big Yule Ball goes terribly awry.  And his confrontation with Voldemort makes for a reasonably thrilling climax.

All the usual characters make an appearance, played by mostly the same actors as before, lending a nice continuity to the series; and a few new characters show up, too.  Among others, Daniel Radcliffe is back as Harry; Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are again Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger; Michael Gambon is Albus Dumbledore; Robbie Coltrane is Hagrid; Maggie Smith is Professor McGonnagall; Alan Rickman is Servius Snape; Gary Oldman is Sirius Black (although you'd barely know him, his part is so brief); Julie Walters is Mrs. Weasley; Mark Williams is Mr. Weasley; Timothy Spall is Wormtail; Warwick Davis is Professor Flitwick; Robert Hardy is Cornelius Fudge; Tom Felton is Draco Malfoy; and Jason Issacs is Lucius Malfoy.

New to the cast are Miranda Richardson as the meddlesome reporter Rita Skeeter, a delightfully nasty character whose role in the film, as I've said, is much reduced from the book; Brendan Gleason as Alastor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody, an eccentric old wizard pressed into teaching duties at Hogworts; Robert Pattinson as Cedric Diggory, Hogworts' co-champion; Stanislav Ianevski and Clemence Poesy as Viktor Krum and Fleur Delacour, rival champions; Roger Lloyd-Pack as Barty Crouch, a representative of the Ministry of Magic; Katie Leung as Cho Chang, the light of Harry's eye; Frances de la Tour as Madame Maxime, a rival school's headmistress and the light of Hagrid's eye; Pedja Bjelac as Igor Karkaroff, another rival headmaster; and Ralph Fiennes, practically unrecognizable under a ton of reptilian makeup, as Lord Voldemort.

If anything, there are probably too many characters, new and old, for the good of a two-and-a-half hour film, so it's a good thing the filmmakers cut down some of the book's exploits.  This single movie could have turned into a ten-hour miniseries.  But I found the sets and costumes as impressive as ever (the Academy nominated the movie for an Oscar in Art Direction) and the visual effects and CGI great, with only the graveyard scene appearing a little too stage bound and static.  In fact, I thought ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" was among best fantasy adventures of the past few years.

Video:
As with the previous ""Potter"" films on Blu-ray disc, the screen size for ""The Goblet of Fire"" replicates the movie's 2.40:1 theatrical-release ratio.  The ""Ultimate Edition"" uses a dual-layer BD50 and a VC-1 codec for the 1080p transfer.  The opening sequence is purposely dark and murky, but it is now much clearer than in standard definition.  A light veneer of natural print grain is hardly noticeable and, in any case, provides a realistic texture.  Despite the director's iron-gray color scheme, the picture is remarkably vivid and lifelike.  Faces are still a tad glossy, and there is a small degree of roughness in select scenes, but these are very minor distractions.  Sharpness and detail are excellent, among the best in the series.

Audio:
As with the other Blu-ray ""Ultimate Edition"" sets in the ""Potter"" series, we find the sound in lossless DTS-HD Master Audio, this one in 5.1 surround.  The sound displays a strong, deep bass; a wide, smooth, natural frequency balance; good midrange clarity; and an abundance of subtle but pinpoint surround-channel activities.  The climactic maze and graveyard scenes are where the rear channels come into their own, though, so wait for it.

Extras:
As with ""The Prisoner of Azakaban,"" this ""Ultimate Edition"" does not include an extended version of the movie.  I don't know why as there are additional scenes among the extras.  Oh, well.  The big bonus in disc one, though, is the ""In-Movie Experience,"" a series of picture-in-picture inserts you can watch simultaneously while viewing the film.  Oliver and James Phelps, who play the Weasley twins, host these commentaries, which also include words from others among the filmmakers; and you can use your remote to move about, if you choose.  In addition, disc one includes twenty-nine scene selections; BD-Live access; English, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish spoken languages; Dutch, French, Portuguese, and Spanish subtitles; and English, German, and Italian captions for the hearing impaired.

Disc two, which is also a Blu-ray with many items in high-def, contains the fourth part of the documentary ""Creating the World of Harry Potter:  Sound & Music,"" fifty-four minutes with the composer, sound designer and others on the movie's musical themes and effects.  Then, we get ""Conversations with the Cast:  Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson,"" thirty minutes, hosted by Richard Curtis; ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire:  Behind the Magic,"" forty-nine minutes on production design; ""Inside Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"" forty-four minutes covering the making of the first four films; ""The Adventure Continues,"" twenty-four minutes on the fourth film; ""Some Animal Magic,"" twenty-three minutes on the animals and creatures in the movie;
Dark Matters, New Masters,"" essentially a thirteen minute preview promo; a series of additional scenes in high def totaling about ten minutes; and a few teaser and theatrical trailers and promos.

Disc three is a regular DVD.  It contains a collection of behind-the-scenes featurettes, with the usual cast and filmmaker comments:  ""Harry Vs. the Horntail: The First Task,"" five minutes; ""In Too Deep: The Second Task,"" nine minutes; ""The Maze: The Third Task,"" six minutes; ""Meet the Champions,"" twelve minutes; ""He Who Must Not Be Named,"" eleven minutes; ""Preparing for the Yule Ball,"" nine minutes; and several tasks and quests (I could never figure out how to get out these games once I'd started).  Then there repeats of the additional scenes; ""Conversations with the Cast""; ""Preparing for the Yule Ball""; ""Reflections on the Fourth Film""; a theatrical trailer; and some DVD-ROM items.

Finally, because this is a big box set, you get a forty-four page photo book with rare images from years one through seven; a year-four lenticular card; two more in a series of character cards; digital copy access of the movie for iTunes and Windows Media (the offer expiring October 17, 2011); a fancy cardboard storage box; and a cardboard slipcover for the box.

Parting Thoughts:
""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" demonstrated that the ""Potter"" movies had not only not run out of steam but appeared to be getting better as they went along.

2503126,4,B000E6EK3S,"When I first read the description on the back of this movie, I was a little worried that this would be another disappointment. Apparently, they were heading into a contest. The thing I was worried about was that the first half of the movie would be contest, and there would be no adventure until much later in the story, plus the fact that I don't care much for that broom sport in the first place.
 Well, I watched it, and it actually was pretty good. Sure they didn't travel far, but the contest wasn't that broom sport, and although most of the movie was contest, it was an adventure contest, and that made it much better.
 This was the first movie in the series that I actually liked and found unique. Sure I liked the second, but it didn't seem to stand out to me in the world of movies, but this one is the only movie that I can remember watching where somebody becomes part fish, but still human.
 But of course, with any Harry Potter film, there are some down sides, but not all are so obvious. First of all, this one had the most suggestive scene so far in the series, and although it wasn't worse then Eric in ""Thor 2"" it was still a little disturbing.
 But, if I remember right, this might be the first film in the series not to use the word ""witchcraft"", which still doesn't excuse it, but makes it at least I don't have to cringe at any casual usages of the word.
 Still, this is the darkest film in the series yet, and it is quite disturbing near the end that a bad guy needs blood to complete a potion, and the ends he goes to, to accomplish getting it.
 But I must say that this was a decent film for those with enough discernment to understand the deference between right and wrong.",1424304000,,1699,4.244582043343653

2503273,3,B000E6EK3S,"When talking about Harry Potter, one must submerge themselves into its every facet. In this particular instance I can only grant a brief view of it, simply because it is too deep to go into at times. But when watching Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, I was in a perpetual state of shock and awe, leaping from one magnificent action scene to the next. For the purposes of this review, I will go right to the action: the Tri-Wizard Cup.

I marveled when we watch Ron and Hermione sit screaming in the stands while Harry battles with Smaug the Terrible, over the treasure of Erebor. There they are, locked in a duel to the death, while Bilbo Baggins, invisible to us, flies in on a broom to save the youth, with all the whooshing effects George Lucas can muster. Just when we think all hope is lost, Katniss Everdeen flies out of the trees and shoots Smaug with a Black arrow, and the animated peril was no more. Oddly enough, Harry only took one Golden egg from Smaug's gold hoard. Who'd a thunk, right?

Anyway, I was astounded when Edward Cullen totally snubs Harry by taking Chinese Bella Swan to the dance instead of him taking her; he totally ruined his chances, right? No growing up for Harry. Going on, though, after being pushed even further by Gandalf the Gray, Edward Cullen starts competing even more with Harry while running away from Jack Torrence through the hedge maze, when they end up in a grave yard. There they meet Grima Wormtongue and Sauron, in a clandestine meeting with the dwarves of Erebor (who for some reason overlooked that Smaug was killed three scenes ago, and got a lot taller). Sauron shoots weird green lights out of a stick at Harry, and then the best part comes.

They also don't explain WHY a certain thing that happens at the end occurs.  In the book they DO explain what happened.

If you've not read the book, you have no idea what you're missing, but you should still read them because if you don't you'll end up being dumb.",1417824000,,441,4.378048780487805

2503333,5,B000E6EK3S,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the excellent fourth movie of the series.  The plot is pretty complex, but it is successfully condensed into film in this movie.  The movie doesn't start at the boring Dursley household, instead it kicks off with a prophetic dream and then moves to further explore the magical world by means of a port key and the Quidditch World Cup.

The plot then moves to the Triwizard Tournament, a three school competition where the magical world is further explored. And the magical world is indeed large.  Not only are there  The numbers of people at the Quidditch World Cup indicate a healthy, large magical community that clearly has a secure niche under the sun.  This makes the struggle-between Pure vs. Mud Bloods a bit forced.  Presumably many Mud-Bloods are at the Quidditch World Cup, and if there are but few Mud Bloods, then the Pure Blood community is able to sustain itself and carry out its cultural activities without fear of discovery are harm by the Muggles.  Additionally there are many exclusive magical schools in many different places, Romania is heavily featured in the movie series.  Again, how is the magical world threatened by Mud Bloods enough for a Voldemort figure to arise with a promise of protection?

The move introduces Mad-Eye Moody, a great grumpy character who is actually Barty Crouch, Jr.  Junior had earlier been a vicious Death Eater and he was in disguise so that he could help bring Voldemort back to full power.  The Triwizard Tournament is part of the scheme to bring back Voldemort and the final test shows how this is done.  The ritual to bring back the Dark Lord is as evil a ritual as one could expect.  Additionally, the Triwizard tournament develops the characters further, especially Neville Longbottom.

Great special effects, perfect casting, and good screenwriting make this complex, large story into a workable movie.",1417392000,,1902,4.9

Unlike the 3rd movie, which, am I the only one who thinks is absolutely brilliant interpretation of the 3rd book of the series?, this movie does not interpret the novel, instead, it tries to cram in as much as possible, and by doing so, it leaves out so much, and the part left out is the character development.  Previously, a lot of attentions are paid to the way story was told via the characters and their growth, but now it turned the other way around, the character is secondary, so it's really difficult to care about them, and in turn it became difficult to care about the story.

Goblet of Fire is intense, but somehow it is not disturbing to kids... I think that the overall message of love triumphing over evil makes the scary stuff seem fun & safe to them... I just know that this whole series has been a very positive experience for our family.  I will always be grateful for Rowling, the publishers, actors & film makers ... they have opened my son to the love of reading and the enjoyment of untangling a very complex story ... wonderful!",1400544000,,736,4.273381294964029

I watch the series from beginning to end at least once a year as a marathon weekend  and I am 60 yrs. old!  It has so many layers to the characters, and frankly, Alan Rickman ( Snape) could read the dictionary to me.

2503789,5,B000E6EK3S,"I have watched the Harry Potter series several times now, mini marathons.  Each time I see something new, some connection, a buried clue foretelling events to come, character traits that reveal so much about the characters and their role in the overall story, and how those characters had to be constructed the way they were in order to bring about the reactions that led to future events.  It is a beautifully threaded tale, truly a modern classic.  One of the telling attributes of a classic is that the story is timeless and the telling and retelling never gets old. I am 61 years old, a writer and an avid reader and movie buff and this shall continue to remain one of my all time favorites, for it is in the Goblet of Fire that the true insidious nature of the evil represented by Voldemort becomes apparent.  While the Sorcerer's Stone, The Chamber of Secrets, and even The Prisoner of Azkaban all are splendid stories in them selves and vital to the overall plot, it is in the Goblet of Fire that Harry and friends find themselves confronted with the true horror that is the evil represented by Lord Voldemort.  The following tales expound on that vision of evil and terror, leading inexhorably to the final confrontation in The Deathly Hallows.  I was fortunate to have read the entire series before ever having seeen the first movie release, and as such can put them both in perspective.  While the movies are spectacular, remaining true to the primary story line and clearly evoking the essence of the tale woven by Ms. Rowlings, the books are, as is usually the case, far more complete and vivid.  Small things make the difference, and the decisions made by the screen writers and directors, while necessary in order to encapsulate such rich complex stories in the time alloted, nonetheless leave out significant details that only a reading of the original text can render.  See the movies, by all means, starting from first and making your way through to last in order.  But do yourself a favor.  If you find the story compelling, take the time to read the original text.  Your time spent will be well reqarded by the added depth and insight provided.  Enjoy!",1396483200,,2171,4.696569920844327

Never thought I'd say that, being the Christian girl who wrote a scathing paper on the evils of Harry Potter, promoting the occult to youth and blah, blah, blah. I read over that paper I ACTUALLY SUBMITTED TO A COLLEGE PROFESSOR and wanted to go back in time and slap that girl into reality.

A Potterhead friend practically begged me to give the series a chance, and it is easily my favorite book series, next to Chronicles of Narnia. I am awaiting the day my 19 month old son is ready for me to read chapter books with him; because this will be our first! The tale woven throughout each of the seven books (eight movies) is one of true, genuine, sacrifical, loving friendship, not only standing up but also FIGHTING for what you believe in (especially when that belief is on the side of good), wins and losses and giving everything you have because it's the right thing to do. I just cannot praise these books enough. If you're on the fence about whether or not you'd want to bother with a ""young adult/kid"" series... just stop. Crack open a used (but very loved) copy of Sorcerer's Stone and GET. SWEPT. UP. in one of the greatest stories of bravery and perseverance and love and --geez, I should stop-- LIFE ever told.

2503845,5,B000E6EK3S,"It is no easy task to bring a movie to life, let alone a movie with an enormous preexisting fan base who have incredibly high expectations. A director who braves bringing a story from the pages to the large screens is forced to walk the tightrope between staying true to the tale to satisfy its fans while also creating a compelling picture to attract an even wider audience from around the world. No problem, right? Mike Newell, director of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, courageously took on this risky role. With his brilliant imagination, along with that of the Harry Potter series author, J.K. Rowling, he excelled in his position. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the movie, truly brings the book to life with its superb acting and life-like special effects.
First and foremost, the characters from the novel are portrayed by skilled actors who effectively embrace their role from the Harry Potter storyline while also bringing special touches of their own.  With a cast including Ralph Fiennes who portrays Lord Voldemort and David Tennant portraying Barty Crouch Junior, there is little room to go wrong. In my opinion, however, an obvious standout from this particular film was Brendan Gleeson, the actor who played the mysterious role of Mad-Eye Moody, Harry Potters deceptive right hand man throughout the Triwizard Tournament, a competition that his school, Hogwarts, was taking part in. A rather creepy character, Gleeson brings Moody to life with his convincing limp and frightening demeanor, always speaking with a menacing growl. His delivery of the lines were incredibly well done, particularly impressive when manically questioning Harry about the return of his master Lord Voldemort in one of the last few scenes. Gleeson perfects the actions of a madman driven by desperation and passion, relentlessly storming around his office and bringing his voice from a scream to a whisper in seconds, possibly giving Daniel Radliffes character, Harry, whiplash from his rapid mood swings.
 Despite the impressive acting performances in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, being a film based on a book with magic spells, strange creatures, and, of course, wizards, this is one movie that requires stellar special effects to truly bring the action to life. Naturally, a consistent theme with the first three movie installments of the Harry Potter series, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire completely surpasses our wildest dreams for this film. From beginning to end there are many realistic effects in use. In fact, I was hooked from the very first scene with Voldemorts incredibly creepy snake, Nagini, making a dramatic entrance with her horrifyingly large body slithering her way on to the screen. Yet, it only gets better from here. The special effects truly work wonders at the climactic point in the film when Harry Potter joins wands with his arch enemy, Lord Voldemort, and a sort of magical explosion occurs between the two, revealing the lives lost at the tip of Voldemorts wand in the forms of ghosts. This occurred in the film just as I had imagined while reading the book, all of the epic from the pages brought forth to the screen.
Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire raises the standards for all other fantasy films of its time, effectively portraying its original book version to a tee, forcing me to pose the question: If Newell can transform a 734 page action-packed book into a single movie, why is the Hunger Games 390 page third installment, Mockingjay, being portrayed in two?",1392595200,,3519,4.993185689948893

2503901,5,B000E6EK3S,"Acquiring the 8-set films of Harry Potter was rather amusing for me.  Having only viewed the films on commercial television, there was of course no opportunity to stop, go back, crank up the volume and find out what someone was whispering.  (Such as the things Sirius calls Snape.)  Like 'Chamber of Secrets' this is unlike 'Sorcerer's Stone' and 'Prisoner of Azkaban' in that there is much new information revealed about the scope of the Wizarding World and the people and plots within.  No, sorry; none will be revealed in this review.

One impressive factor is the physicality of Daniel Radcliffe (and his stunt doubles, naturally!).  Radcliffe has a long underwater sequence that has many face shots, so despite CGI we must believe he did many of these stunts himself.  This is not just running from rock to rock as cover, this is a long-term swim doing a dolphin style - and no doubt hoping the rubber feet and finger-webs do not fall off in the middle of a shot!

As to the disk itself - it contains the movie.  Do not expect extras.  Those are in different packaging and/or on the Blu-Ray versions.  (This review is of the DVD.)  This DVD does show some sloppy transfer, some scenes just too dark or bright, and a couple that are plain out of focus (a criminal activity when it comes to film-to-disc transfer).  I prefer a few extras, trailers at least, and preferably commentary or a short about the 'Making Of'.  This tells me I received something extra for purchasing a film, rather than renting a single view.

If you are (or are becoming, as I am) a Harry Potter fan, this is simply Year Four.  To stand alone in an 8-film series is a task for both screenwriters and director to face, and this episode of Harry Potter can indeed be viewed as the sole Potter film seen.  The Tri-Wizard Tournament is a valid excuse for a film; that it fits seamlessly into the  overall story is rather secondary (the others seem a build-up or What Happened After).  'Goblet of Fire' also is the turning point from Harry Potter being a pleasant fantasy for 11-year-olds to 15-year-olds facing the seriousness of living in the adult world (Wizarding or Muggle) and the challenges that actually exist on a daily basis.  This film gets dark in tone near the end, and continues to darken through 'Deathly Hallows, Part 1"" (the darkest of the lot, as 'Deathly Hallows, Part 2' resolves the series and there is much more light at the end).

2503975,4,B000E6EK3S,"Since I got into the Harry Potter series a few months ago, I've been asking people what they think of it. To my surprise, most of them said they stopped after the Prisoner of Azkaban. Personally, I think Azkaban was the best one so far, so why not continue? The unanimous answer was that they didn't really want to see the kids grow up. In the Goblet of Fire, they aren't quite there yet, as in their 4th year at Hogwarts, the kids are 14. The story this time isn't centered around some mysterious artifact or person, but rather a world wide competition of student wizards. The Goblet of Fire decides who the best of the best are, allowing only one student from each school to participate. This film was special, but also lacked some of the intrigue that got us addicted to Harry Potter in the first place. Finally, a Harry Potter film focuses entirely on Harry and we get to see some of the great things that he is supposedly capable of. In fact, Ron and Hairmony's roles amount to little more than bit parts, where as in the other three films, they were all on equal ground. The fact that this was a competition takes something major away from the film. In the Goblet of Fire we aren't introduced to any new artifacts, games, or spells, there really isn't anything here that will amaze you. While it's a small thing, it's an expected thing, that does take something away from the film. What makes up for it is a terrific ending, that has to be seen in order to continue on with the series. For years, I thought Harry Potter was just overrated, pop culture, bull s***, but once I sat down to actually watch it, I came to realize that this series is as magically as the world it portrays. Every one of the first four films has been fantastic and I can't wait to see what the future has in store for the wizards of Hogwarts.",1385942400,,1823,4.348973607038123

However, I'm motivated to write this because I'm very angry after just wasting the rental money on this movie and still not being able to watch it. My kids are devastated. The banner under the movie says it's compatible with Xbox 3, but fails to tell you you have to have purchased Xbox Live to have it work. Seriously, Amazon? We have an HDMI cord, latest Xbox, wifi, and many other ways that we typically use to watch and connect various mediums.

Here we are in 2013, and Amazon can't find a way for people to watch their media using other devices? We mostly use an iPad to access online media, but evidently that's too advanced for Amazon. We are very disappointed and will never again bother wasting our money on any of their rentals or digital media!

2504226,5,B000E6EK3S,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire brings back Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson as Harry, Ron, and Hermione. We also have Alan Rickman, Michael Gambon, and Robbie Coltrane, Tom Felton and Jason Isaacs returning as Snape, Dumbledore, Hagrid, and Draco/Lucius Malfoy. Now this is where it gets really interesting with the long list of newcomers to the movie. Robert Pattinson plays Cedric Diggory; he did a fair enough job. Katie Leung plays Cho Chang; she did a good job, Clemence Posey as Fleur Delacour, and Ralph Fiennes as the villian himself, Lord Voldemort. Initially, I did not think he was exactly the right fit for his role, but boy was I wrong. He literally breathes the necessary evil and life into the character so well. Really great job by every actor/actress in the movie; you can really tell that each actor/actress was carefully selected for his/her role.

The Story: Harry is with the Weasleys and Hermione at the Quidditch World Cup, when after all the sports are over, danger quickly arises in the form of Death Eaters. Later in the story, while at Hogwarts, Harry finds that he has been unexpectedly selected to compete along Cedric Diggory, Viktor Krum, and Fleur Delacour in the dangerous Triwizard Tournament. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire brings yet a 4th time thrills, occasional laughs, but also a danger like there has never been in the wizarding world. It is a great story and even better movie.

My kids and I, all of which have read the books, definitely missed some of the finer points of the storyline from the novel; my husband, who hasn't read the book, kept telling us to be quiet and not ruin the movie for him :-).

2504375,1,B000E6EK3S,"The Goblet of Fire was one of my favorite of the Harry Potter books.  I felt as though it was the turning point in the series because of the rise of Lord Voldemort and the Minister of Magic's immediate response. Needless to say, the director/screenwriter/actors all seemed to drop the ball.

I understand that 734 pages of novel are very hard to put into a 2 and 1/2 hour movie intended for kids, but I don't understand why some films based on books will push aside elements of the novel that were entertaining and critical plot pieces (i.e. the Dursleys, Winky the House Elf, Ludo Bagman, Weasley Wizarding Wheezes, the additional fallout after Harry tells everyone about Voldemort's return, etc.) and fill it in with bits of movie that were not only not in the book but contribute nothing to the story (i.e. Ron's sonnet to Krum at the Quidditch World Cup? Beauxbatons and Durmstrang students' dancing entrances to Hogwarts? Harry flying with the Hungarian Horntail around the castle and killing it? etc.).  In short, I feel as though they could have put in some much more interesting stuff from the books in the movies if they cut out some of those pointless aspects.

Perhaps the greatest frustration of all was how some characters in the film were totally different from how they were in the book.  Albus Dumbledore in the books would have never laid a hand on a student in anger, but Albus Dumbledore in this movie saw fit to throw Harry up against a wall and yell in his face after his name came out of the Goblet of Fire. This in itself turned me off from most if not all of the movie.",1367107200,,1593,4.536585365853658

2504408,4,B000E6EK3S,"Like I said in my review for Year 3's UE set, this should have had an extended edition.  My thoughts on that subject remain here.  While the deleted scenes are available in the extras, it is far better to see them incorporated into the movie, then just thrown together.

This is the movie where the dark part of the story takes hold.  It is also the book where they had to cut the most out.  The book is over 600 pages long, and they would have had to split the movie into two parts (something that was considered) to get it all in.  Eventually they just decided to cut the ancillary story lines and just tell the story following Harry and nobody else.  The one thing that I think suffers from that is we do not get to see enough of the character of Cedric and thus the emotional impact later on in the movie is lessened because his character is barely on screen for a lot of the film.

Aside from that, the big reveal at the end of the movie when Voldemort finally returns in the flesh was great.  Ralph Fiennes does a wonderful job bringing the sinister aspect of Voldemort to life.  He is not on the screen for a long time in the movie, but for the amount he is, he gave the sense that he was going to be the perfect ""big bad"" the rest of the way.  The other new character is Mad Eye Moody.  Not to give too much away (although I am sure most reading this have already seen it) Brendan Gleeson does a great job playing a character who is playing a character.  The version of Mad Eye he plays in this one is more over the top than in the later films.  The other new character is Rita Skeeter, the gossip columnist played by Miranda Richardson.  She plays the slimy journalist who plays fast and loose with the truth to perfection.

As are the case with the other UE versions, the extras are great, and are pretty much as long as the movies.  If you can live without having an extended version of the film, and do a little price shopping, this is a great add to your collection.",1364083200,,1979,4.179419525065963

2504448,2,B000E6EK3S,"This movie has about 1 hour where the content is as good as the other Harry Potter movies.  The movie is disjointed, and has no continuity.  There are long stretches that should have been cut (e.g. the overlong ball/dance scene).  The score is an issue as well, as the film's composer shows no melodic imagination...it's like very very bad Andrew Lloyd Webber (who I'm not particularly a fan of anyway), is soupy, and boring.  John Williams' music helped make the 3 previous films amazing, and he is seriously missed here.",1362441600,,522,4.766666666666667

2504512,5,B000E6EK3S,"Here we've come to the midpoint in the movie series.  The previous movie was a shadow of the book.  They hit the highlights and would give the watcher the very, very basics of what the watcher would need to keep up with the story line.  Here we again see the basics given to us with characters being combined with other to make sure all the actions and deeds are carried out.  In the end they filled in some 'gaps' or questions left over from the book and added a few things that could have been left out.  In the end its good for young kids.",1361318400,,542,4.123809523809523
2504513,4,B000E6EK3S,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is an outstanding addition to the series. The heart of the book Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was the Triwizard Tournament tasks and the graveyard scene in which Voldemort returns and the filmmakers did a fantastic job bringing those things to film. 1st,the visual effects work done on this movie was fantastic. One reason it's so much better to watch Goblet of Fire than to read Goblet of Fire is that a lot things in Goblet of Fire,including the arrivals of the foreign students and all of the Triwizard tasks,especially the First Task with the Dragons,that can be best enjoyed and appreciated if they are actually seen,that's just the nature of the Goblet of Fire. And the duel between Harry and Voldemort is one of the best and most gripping scenes through the 1st 4 Harry Potter movies,just so well done all around. The way the flying carriages,the dragons,even the flame in the Goblet of Fire,was just so perfect. 2nd,the acting in this movie is fantastic. I particularly liked Mad Eye Moody. The way Mad Eye Moody comes across in the movie is exactly the way I imagine him when I read the book. I also thought the portrayal of Lucius was well don. I could really feel the tension between Lucius and Voldemort in that scene. And Daniel gives his best performance yet as Harry. Then there's the fact that Mike Newell had a very good feel for what was important in the story from the book and what was not. Notice how unimportant things like S.P.E.W. are left out of the movie while important things such as the Triwizard tasks and the graveyard scene are included. Sure,there are a few scenes,such as Hermione teaching Harry the Accio charm,that should have been in that weren't,but,overall,the decisions on what to include in the movie and what to leave out were on target. Finally,the emotional scenes in this movie feel so real. I cried 3 times when I 1st saw this movie in the theatre. !st when Cedric's shadow asks Harry to take his body back,2nd when Harry arrives back in the maze carrying Cedric's dead body,and finally during Dumbledore's speech about Cedric. The Harry Potter franchise succeeds in making readers/viewers care about its characters. The only reason I don't go with 5 stars is because it's a bit slow in the middle. This could have been resolved by editing the Yule Ball out of the movie. When I watch my DVD of this movie at home,I always skip over the Yule Ball and it's amazing how much better and more pleasantly paced the movie is without it. (I always thought the Yule Ball should have been edited out of the book,as it adds NOTHING to the plot.) While there is a big plothole,in that Voldemort didn't have to go to that much trouble to get Harry's blood,the blame for that lies with the book,this review is judging the film as an adaptation.  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire returned movie magic to Harry Potter.",1361145600,,2894,4.63035019455253
2504514,4,B000E6EK3S,"This was the first Harry Potter movie I saw, and remains one of my favorites. This was where the series became more mature and darker as the kids grew older. Great story as well, even makes a decent stand alone film.",1361059200,,216,4.2926829268292686

2504516,3,B000E6EK3S,"I am so glad that I read the book before seeing this terrible adaptation.  So much of the story was left out that I find it hard to believe that anyone who sees only the movie would know what is going on.

First of all, the two house elves Winky and Dobby were left out of the movie altogether, even though they were integral to the storyline. Ludo Bagman was also omitted. The characters of the other TriWizard champions, Fleur and Viktor, were so under developed that you could not particularly care what happened to them during the course of this ill-directed movie.  I really miss Chris Columbus. Mike Newell does a terrible job here.  He decided it was a good idea to film everything in the dark.  Sure, the subject matter WAS dark, but I think movie viewers would like to see what the hell is happening.

Thumbs down on this one.  I hope Newell will be absent in subsequent Potter films.",1360800000,,893,4.441717791411043

2504601,3,B000E6EK3S,"While the first two films were cut to the point of losing depth of character they still remained true to the spirit of the story.  This film was butchered to the point of a one note song that was simply boring.  After awhile you just adapt out to the heavy dark mood that has none of the Harry Potter spirit.  There is no humor.  There is no strength to the characters and Dumbledoor is so off key it is painful.  Much of the story is changed to the point of losing meaning.  I suppose all the budget and time was spent on special effects (also what took away from the third film, Prisoner of Azkaban).  I had hoped that in the Prisoner of Azkaban the Bluray version might be extended so that it did not feel so cut (it did not) but even extending this film would not have done anything to improve it.  I understand a director wanting to put their mark on a film but this was not the mark to have left.

It is a fine Disney or Warner Brother's type film to enjoy which is why I gave it 3stars.  It is not worthy of the book.",1357689600,,1024,4.0497512437810945

2504697,4,B000E6EK3S,"Ok, I'm being asked for my review of this product, which I just learned has left the seller facility today. The most I can say right now is, it's a fast-moving movie which is already on its way to me even thought I only ordered it a day and a half ago. As for the acting, I suspect the actors are getting even better than before, because they're older and more experienced than they were in the previous movies. This is because this movie was made after the ones that I've seen so far, time-line-speaking, and their ages have also progressed, age-wise, in the same direction.
All seriousness aside, I love the Potter movies because they remind me of my youth as an adult in Scotland when I was stationed there as an ignorant American sailor who often visited small villages and castles but was too stupid to appreciate it. There was magic in the air back then, or maybe just the lack of smog, and the many pints of lager, but my point being, I watch these movies for the old-timey, British atmosphere that I miss so much, which only existed in my mind, even back when I was there.",1354060800,,1080,4.378109452736318
2504698,5,B000E6EK3S,"Director Mike Newel and writer Steve Kloves usher us through the fourth installment of the ""Harry Potter"" series, which finds our now 14-year-old hero(Daniel Radcliffe) facing a new set of challenges.
 Instead of finding Harry with his uncaring relatives on Privet Drive, this story begins with him spending time with the Weasley Family, whose parents (Mark Williams and Julie Walters) are happy to have him, as are the Weasley siblings, especially his best friend Ron(Rupert Grint), twins Fred and George(James and Oliver Phelps), and the youngest, Ginny(Bonnie Wright).
 But Harry continues to have bad dreams involving his archnemesis Lord Voldemort(Ralph Fiennes, in his first outing in the role), including one in which he sees a man named Frank Bryce(Eric Sykes)killed by the Dark Lord when he overhears a conference between Voldemort and Wormtail(Timothy Spall). The jagged scar Voldemort gave Harry the night he murdered Harry's parents begins to burn again for the first time in over a year.
  Hermione Granger(Emma Watson), brilliant, but still as bossy as ever, joins Harry and the Weasleys at the Burrow for the occassion of the World Cup Quidditch Match. They are joined by Mr. Weasley's associate, Amos Diggory(Jeff Rawle), and his strikingly handsome young son, Cedric( a pre-""Twilight"" era Robert Pattinson), a Hogwarts student from Hufflepuff House.
  Harry learns about traveling by portkey, which will be relevant to him later on, and enjoys time in the magical tents in which spectators camp out on the outskirts of the stadium. Despite an encounter with the arrogant Malfoys(Jason Issacs and Tom Felton), the protagonists enjoy themselves, and delight in the appearance of World Champion Quidditch player Viktor Krum(Stanislav Ianevski), before the Death Eaters arrive and ruin everything.
  Soon the teenagers are all back at Hogwarts,where, during the beginning of term banquet, they greet the exchange students from the French school, Beaubatons Academy,presided over by Madame Olympe Maxime(Frances de la Tour), who make a very graceful, nuanced, and ethereal entrance. The most prominently featured students of this academy will be Fleur de la Coer( Clemence Poesy) and her sister, Gabrielle(Angelica Mandy). Under the patronage of Igor Karkaroff(Predrag Bjelac), the young men of Bulgaria's Darmstrang Academy, including Victor Krum, thunder in. In the book, both schools were co-ed, but here they are both single gender. Still,just by looking at some of the Hogwarts students, one can sense some apprehension at the arrival of those who may become rivals for the affections of other Hogwarts students.
 Still, all the regulars join in when Headmaster Dumbledore(Michael Gambon) leads them in singing the laughable school song. Harry, for whom Hogwarts has been his salvation, really gets into the spirit of the thing.
  In the meantime, our young hero is taking a budding interest in the pretty young Ravenclaw House student,Cho Chang(Katie Leung), having more than one awkward moment in her presence.
  The year's main event is the Triwizard Tournament, in which three 17-year-old wizards partake in a series of brutal and challenging tests, the prize being a cup and some money.
  Names of the participants will be drawn from a magical goblet of fire, and the chosen will not be able to refuse, being bound to the tournament by magical contract. Those wishing to participate may place their own names in the goblet may do so. But Dumbledore drew a barrier around the goblet to prevent underage wizards from having their names placed in the goblet. The Weasley Twins' attempt to bypass the barrier with an aging potion they concocted despite Hermione's warnings against it, provides a comical moment.
 The names of the participants are announced. They include Fleur de la Coeur,Cedric Diggory, Viktor Krum, and to everyone's surprise, the underaged Harry.
 Many of his classmates, including Ron, turn against Harry, accusing him of putting his own name in the goblet, creating not only minor tension, but outright hostility.
 The Hogwarts staff, including Snape(Alan Rickman) and McGonagall(Maggie Smith), find themselves at a loss initially, but they relctantly agree to let the events play out. New to the staff is the Defense against the Dark Arts teacher, Alastor ""Mad Eye"" Moody, a crude mannered one-legged tippler with a fake glass eye that can see at all angles. Moody is recruited to keep an eye on Harry.
 Via communication through the flaming logs of the fire in the Gryffindor common room, Harry is advised by Sirius Black(Gary Oldman)briefly, and later consoled by Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane)as he is briefed about the first task of the tournament. An interesting sidenote is the budding romance between Hagrid and Madame Maxime.
 Tabloid journalist Rita Skeeter ( Miranda Richardson) causes further aggravation when she prints falsehoods about Harry (and later Hermione) in ""The Daily Prophet"" while covering the tournament.
 Harry triumphs in his first task, and is reconciled with Ron. The first task gives him the key to the second task.
 In the meantime, the two reconciled friends have to figure out how to get dates for the upcoming Yule Ball, which (aside from Ron's hideous attire, which he should have been able to change with the wave of a wand) is intially a grand and profoundly beautiful moment, especially with the entrance of the exquisitely coiffed and clad Hermione, who truly blossoms into an English rose. The Pavel Sisters, Padma and Parvati(Afshan Azad, Shefari Chowdhury)whom Ron and Harry escort, counterbalance Hermione's notable appearance exotically with their traditional Indian Saris.
  Sometime later, while mulling things over in the bath,the ghost Moaning Myrtle(Shirley Henderson) helps Harry uncover the clue regarding his next task of the tournament, amid the beauty of one who could be a choir soloist. Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) oftentimes viewed as weak, clumsy, but determined, suceeds in lending a guiding hand to Harry.
  A moral decision made during that leg of the tournament boosts Harry's standing, although the victory goes to another.
  The final leg of the tournament will be the most devastating, but Harry will get through it with guidance from the spirits of his parents(Geraldine Somerville and Adrian Rawlins) as he confronts the reincarnated Dark Lord once again, and Harry's dreams will begin to make sense.
 Roger Lloyd-Park and David Tennant have relevant roles as the Barty Crouches--Sr. and Jr.
 Seeking consolation from each other after an eventful year, we watch three best friends view the flight of a magical carriage taking very special people back to France, and a magical ship submerge en route back to Bulgaria. But with strong allies in his corner, Harry has lived to fight another day.",1354060800,,6801,5.282003710575139

2504779,4,B000E6EK3S,"Ok, so I'm probably going to be fairly unpopular with my assessment of this movie, but considering the 4th book is probably my favorite (equally tied with the 1st) I expected a lot from the movie, and it just didn't deliver for me.  On a different subject though, if you're reading this review and haven't seen any of the other movies or read the books yet, turn around, go start at the beginning.  You'll regret it if you don't because such a wonderful series as this has to start at the beginning.

Harry Potter is in his fourth year at Hogwarts, like usual he has the summer to be with his aunt and uncle though (who are loathsome people).  But this summer is a little different, the Quidditch World Cup is going on and Harry attends with his friends and their family.  But something goes terribly awry at the tournament, and it sets the tone for the rest of the year.  Harry's nightmares too point to something terrible happening, something involving Voldemort.  But at school these fears are quickly put aside when it is announced that the Tri-Wizard tournament will be held at Hogwarts, and include two other schools.  The all boys school Durmstrang, and the all girls school Beauxbaton.  One champion will be picked from each school to compete in a series of challenges and ultimately be the winner of the Tri-Wizard Cup.  The only problem is, Harry somehow becomes a fourth contestant, and the games can be brutal.

Characters:
Daniel Radcliffe: Harry Potter
Rupert Grint: Ron Weasley
Emma Watson: Hermione Granger
Robbie Coltrane: Rubeus Hagrid
Ralph Fiennes: Lord Voldemort
Michael Gambon: Albus Dumbledore
Brendan Gleeson: Alstor Moody
Gary Oldman: Sirius Black
Miranda Richardson: Rita Skeeter
Alan Rickman: Severus Snape

What can I say about Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson that I haven't already?  They make a great team on the set and you can truly believe they are the best of friends.  I enjoy watching them in every single movie.  The same with Coltrane as Hagrid, you can't help but love him as he stumbles around on the screen.  Gambon as Dumbledore had a larger part this time, and while I appreciated that, I just didn't feel the warmth from him like there is in the book.  He just was written more approachable than the role is actually played so that is a bit disappointing.  The new characters in this movie were cast ok, but none of them have the charm that the original cast members do.

The plot did not really follow the book that well.  Sure there are plenty of moments that are the same, but for a lot of the important things it was vastly changed.  And I did not like that at all.  Especially the last challenge of the Tri-Wizard tournament.  It didn't even remotely resemble what was in the book and it was a very small part in the overall scheme of the movie.  It was disappointing.  The same with a lot of the interaction of the three schools.  So much was missed and I think it really detracted from the magic of the movie.  Actually, despite the movie being so long, it just felt rushed, like they didn't care about the details in this one.

Luckily the cinematography was mostly back up to par in this movie.  Everything seemed more authentic, but as said before, lacking in detail.  There were so many things they could have included from the books to make it spectacular (sphinx anyone?) and they just didn't for whatever reason.  The music was still good, and I still get that shiver down my spine when I hear the opening music, so I'm glad that there is something I can rely on.  Although the music/choreography for the introduction of Beauxbaton was just plain weird to me (watch and see if you agree!).  By contrast, Durmstrang's entrance was much better.

I'll always watch all of the movies and enjoy them, but I do admit I cringe a little bit when I get to this one.  If I hadn't have read the books I probably would have enjoyed it more, but it still would have felt rushed.

2504788,5,B000E6EK3S,"This is a great product. The only bad thing is the fact that it does not include the Extended version, but for that matter this is what I have to say about that.
WB had nothing to do with the Extended version not being in it. The director refused to invlude the extended version. only Chris Columbus (1 & 2) agreed to the extended cuts being included.

This is probably one of my favorite if not my favorite Harry Potter movie. Excellent video and sound quality. Even though I was skeptical of the ""Creating the world of Harry Potter Part 4: Sounds and music"" it was worth it. It was very interesting how they got the ideas for the music and how they created the sounds of magical thing considering several things in the films do not exist. All of the booklets are interesting with film and production stills.

The students are growing up, the stakes are getting higher, and this, of course, features the full return of Voldemort. And of course there's the character played by an actor doomed to play that infernal pasty white sparkly vampire in the years to come. Where's a Voldemort or Wormtail in those Twilight films when you really need a sparkly vampire dispatched anyway?",1337040000,,454,4.909090909090909
2504820,5,B000E6EK3S,"This is the Potter movie that suffers the most from the transition from book to movie. It is the fattest book, but the movie is approximately the same length as the others, so even more is left out than usual. Having said that, it is still a good movie, a very good movie. It's just a frustration to the fans of the books, but it's marvelous for those who have never read them.

Unlike the first three movies, we do not start with the Dursleys. Harry is visiting at the Burrow (Weasley's place), and has a dream about Voldemort, Wormtail, and someone who is clearly a younger follower of Voldemort whom Harry does not recognize. When he wakes up, it is to Hermione shaking him awake so they can get ready for their trip to the Quidditch World Cup. This is the first we learn there is a Quidditch World Cup, and that there are other schools of magic besides Hogwarts. There is Durmstrang (quite Prussian in style) and there is Beaubatons (decidedly French).

But we don't get to see the World Cup at all, just the opening ceremonies that glorify the Bulgarian seeker, Viktor Krum. Next thing you know it is over, and suddenly the grounds are aflame through the marching violence of the Death Eaters. (Readers of the book know just how very much more there is to this.) The same young man who was in Harry's dream serving Voldemort conjures the Dark Mark into the sky. (No Winky; no house elves at all in this episode.)

We no sooner get to Hogwarts than the Beaubatons carriage and the Durmstrang sailing ship appear, apparently on the first day of school. There are only girls (not a word about veela) in the Beaubatons contingent, and only boys in the Durmstrang group. Including, of course, Viktor Krum.

Rita Skeeter is there, annoying as ever, but nothing is ever said about her being an unregistered anamagus. She just delivers her lies and half-truths to the Daily Prophet and infuriates Harry and Hermione, whom she insists on linking romantically. Hermione's beautiful revenge is altogether missing, which is a great pity.

But we do have the Yule Ball, and Ron's ghastly antique dress robes, and Padme and Parvati Patil, and all the jealousies mentioned in the book. They managed to get all that in, no matter what else was left out. (Grrrrrr!)

And of course we have the Triwizard Tournament. That story is told rather like the way it was in the book, although the problems encountered in the maze are way over-simplified. No blast-end skrewts, no Sphinx, mostly just weird vegetable matter and the imperious curse on Krum. And of course the trophy cup is a port key. But I won't spoil the rest. The story is basically the same from here out.

So try not to mourn for the missing parts, and enjoy the movie. It does have complexity, in spite of all that cutting, and as a movie, it's pretty darn good.",1336953600,,2811,4.587649402390438

The Film

With each progressive entry into the Harry Potter franchise the plots become darker and bleaker as Harry's world becomes more dangerous.  Prisoner of Azkaban had a much darker look and feel than its predecessor's and that trend continues in spades in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.  Darker, moodier, and filled with more teen angst than previous installments, Goblet of Fire is just as much a fantasy film as it is a coming of age story.  Some of the glammer and glitz of Harry's magical world begins to chip away as Harry moves away from childhood and is thrown into adulthood.

This year's adventure begins with Harry and company attending the Quiddich World Cup.  While at the World Cup he encounters Lord Voldemort's followers for the first time.  When back at school he finds out that Hogwart's is hosting the Tri-Wizard Tournament, a competition where contestants from three magical schools compete against each other in three magical trials.  Harry is too young to enter but somehow his name is selected and is thrown into a tournament where he is put up against three competitors that are several years ahead of him in magical skill.  Harry must also deal with the changing dynamics of friendship, another new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher (are you seeing a pattern yet?), asking out a girl for the first time, and find out how his name was entered into the Tournament and why.

While not as enjoyable as Prisoner of Azkaban there's a lot to like about this film.  While not really improving on Azkaban, this film compliments it well.  There's still a good amount of humor in Goblet of Fire but it's not overpowering and seems more natural to the characters.  A lot of the humor succeeds because of the continuing growth of the young leads.  Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson get better with each passing film and know their characters inside and out.  Their familiarity with their roles and how their characters interact with one another add a layer of complexity to their performances that first began to emerge in Prisoner of Azkaban.  Goblet of Fire is more action oriented then previous Potter films with at least five scenes featuring a lot of CGI action.  The CGI all looks great regardless of whether its computer creatures, backgrounds, or other assorted effects they all blend in seamlessly with the rest of the picture.  It's pretty remarkable what a difference four years make in the computer effects world because there were numerous scenes in Sorcerer's Stone that looked horrendous in 2001 and downright embarrassing now whereas Goblet of Fire still looks extremely polished almost six years after its release.  Mike Newell steps into the director's chair for Goblet of Fire.  At first glance he would seem to be an odd choice to direct a Harry Potter film considering up to that point his most commercially successful film was Four Weddings and a Funeral.  What you might not realize is he directed several episodes of the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles, the Johnny Depp /Al Pacino mob film Donny Brasco, and the black comedy Pushing Tin with John Cusack and Billy Bob Thornton.  None of those films by themselves make me think he's the right choice to helm a Potter film but collectively he's hitting on enough different genres to be an interesting choice.  Think about it, do Harry Potter films fit into one film genre easily?  Not really, each film is of course different but there is drama, fantasy, action, (family friendly) horror, comedy, and romance in almost every film.  Therefore you need a director that can interweave these different themes into a balanced but engaging film.

The biggest gripe I have about the movie is a rather petty one.  What's with all the long hair on the boys?  Each movie is suppose to take place less than two months after the last one ended but they all look like their hairs been growing out six months or longer.  It just doesn't fit in well with the rest of the series.  Harry & Ron's hair is relatively short in Azkaban but is well past Harry's ears and is down near Ron's shoulders.  Obviously, the cast or someone at WB said it looked laughable because all the boys get a hair cut by the start next film (which starts only a few weeks after this film ends remember).

Goblet of Fire had a lot to live up to after the brilliant casting job done for Prisoner of Azkaban.  Brendan Gleeson joins as the cast as the heavily scarred and paranoid new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher Mad Eye Moody.  Gleeson seems to have a great time playing the character who's slightly mad (pun somewhat intended) and wears A LOT of facial make-up and prosthetics.  He had large shoes to fill but does an admirable job filling the void left by the absence of David Thewlis and Gary Oldman.

In a small but no less important role is David Tennant.  He was a bit of an unknown at the time to American audiences since he had just taken over as the new Doctor in Doctor Who but now has a bit more of a following.  David Tennant is only in about ten minutes of the film but you'll think he was in a lot more until you sit down and really think about it.  One minor cast addition that wasn't considered terribly important at the time but now has a huge following is that of Robert Pattinson, best known now as the sparkling vampire from Twilight.  He plays the other Hogwart's champion and romantic rival for Harry.  He's not terrible in this and he's much less emo than he is in the sparkling vampire movies.  At the time of the film's release I never thought he'd turn into the teen heart throb he is today.  That just goes to show how little in common I have with tween girls and forty year old desperate woman.

If there's one area that Goblet of Fire really has an advantage over every book or movie that came before it's the addition of a real, sustained villain in the form of Ralph Fiennes' Lord Vodemort.  We've seen him before in the series, both in Sorcerer's Stone and in Chamber of Secrets but here we get the real deal.  Fiennes' has played his fair share of terrifying monsters whether it be the evil S.S. officer Oman Goeth in Schindler's List or Francis ""The Tooth Fairy"" Dolarhyde in Red Dragon and he continues to prove that he can play one of the best psychotics in film today.  The addition of Fiennes as Voldemort really ratchets up the tension and finally gives Harry Potter a serious, physical villain to go up against.

There's a lot to enjoy about this installment; director Mike Newell successfully begins to transform the ""kids"" into adults and the added adult themes are dealt with without alienating the younger audience.  The new additions to the cast continue to enrich Harry's world and elevates the younger stars performances just by being in their presence.  Goblet of Fire is a worthy follow up effort to Prisoner of Azkaban and while it doesn't surpass it keeps the series moving in a great direction.

The Blu-ray

The Goblet of Fire Ultimate Edition Blu-ray has similar packaging attributes as the Prisoner of Azkaban set.  What does that mean?  It's taller than than the first two sets and has a lenticualar card inserted on the front cover.  For more details on the packaging differences please see my review of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.  Director Mike Newell was given the opportunity to create an Extended Cut of the film but like Alfonso Cuarn he said that his preferred version of the film was the theatrical cut of the film.  Also included in the set is a second Blu-ray disc of extras, a third disc is filled with standard definition extras, a piece of paper with a digital copy code, the collectible book, and two new character cards (Ron Weasley, Mad Eye Moody).

The Ultimate Edition of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire features the same transfer of the previous HD-DVD and Blu-ray releases of 2007.  This is a top of the line transfer that is sure to impress fans and newcomers alike.  Black levels are inky, colors are vivid, and the level of detail is astonishing.  You won't find any dirt or other blemishes, simply put the original source was in pristine condition.  The transfer also easily handles fog and smoke, I didn't notice any instances of macroblocking which is always a good sign since fog and smoke can easily trip up a lesser transfer.  This is an outstanding transfer slightly outclassing Prisoner of Azkaban and is the best of the original first four films.

The DTS-HD Master Audio track is sourced from the same elements as the Uncompressed PCM 5.1 track used on the 2007 Blu-ray.  Goblet of Fire is more of an action film than any of the other entries.  The surround channels come alive early and often and if you've been waiting to hear some great action scenes you're in for a treat now.  There are several scenes that will give your subwoofer a workout especially the scene where Harry faces off against a dragon and the climatic ending.  Dialogue is intelligible even when the action picks up and is never drowned out by Patrick Doyle's wonderful score.  Just like with the video this is best audio presentation of the first four films.

The only special feature that disc one features is the PiP ""In-Movie Experience"" that was only available on the 2007 HD-DVD.  It's your standard PiP track that gives you lots of behind the scenes material and is hosted by James & Oliver Phelps who play the Weasley twins.  It's an informative track but there are some rather long gaps that may frustrate some viewers that might have just watched the movie in its entirety.

Disc two of course features the forth segment of the eight part documentary, Creating the World of Harry Potter Part Four: Sound & Music.  While I'm sure some will find this documentary very interesting I found it to be a bit dry for my taste.  It's certainly informative but listening to the composers and sound designers talk at length about their creative process just isn't interesting enough to keep my interest for almost an entire hour.  There is a collection of eight deleted scenes, presented in HD running about ten total minutes.  None of the scenes offer anything mind shattering but some of them might be interesting to die hard Potter fans.  Also include on disc two are five vintage TV specials.  The final offerings are on disc two are two theatrical trailer presented in HD.  Disc three is filled with SD carryover material from the earlier DVD edition of the film.  As with the other Ultimate Editions I didn't bother even putting this SD filth in my player.

Conclusion

Goblet of Fire is a very good film that is both emotionally satisfying and is technically sound.  Both the video and audio presented on the disc are top notch and will definitely please most Blu-ray enthusiasts.  The PiP track is decent but the Creating the World of Harry Potter is the weakest entry of the sets so far.  If you're just interested in picking up the movie on Blu-ray the single disc release from 2007 is a great option and can be picked up for about $10 on Amazon.",1329523200,,11521,4.665674603174603

2504828,4,B000E6EK3S,"I think this is one of the more fun of the Potter movies, and one of the best suited for younger children, as it has a lot of action and 'color' due to the opening sequence at the professional Quidditch championship match, and the Tri-Wizard tournament once everyone arrives at Hogwarts. However, as other reviewers have stated, the lack of additional features on this edition is disappointing, but I've decided to dock only 1 star for that, rather than panning the entire movie because of this problem.

The Triwizard tournament offers a lot of opportunity for great special effects, including the arrival of the other two teams - in a giant submergible ship, and a stagecoach pulled by flying horses. The Velas are a bit disappointing however, it seems most of their charms must have ended up on the cutting room floor. Other things also felt a bit rushed - the opening Quidditch match is superbly done, and I would have loved more time there. We also don't get to see any of Harry's opponents in the first Triwizard challenge - the dragon challenge - although Harry's battle with his dragon is superb. The other challenges are handled well though, and considering the amount of groundwork this movie has to cover, overall it does a great job.

The dynamics of the characters are also done well, and the psychological challenges of adolescence as they unfold - Ron's initial jealousy, the growing tension/attraction between Hermione and Ron, Harry's burgeoning crush on Cho. These are important themes in the rest of the story, and they are handled well here. And when it all finally and definitely turns dark with the death of Cedric, it is heart-wrenching - the pain of his father grieving over his body changes everything (and of course, this part is not so good for young children, although I chose to show it to mine and talk through it.) This marks a turning point in the battle between good and evil as they play out in this series, and it was very critical that it was given the weight it needed.

So overall, a great film, in terms of both special effects and the unfolding drama. Leaves us ready for the battle to begin in book and movie 5.",1327276800,,2152,4.657894736842105

The almighty Goblet accepts Harry into the deadly competition. Professor Dumblemore (Michael Gambon) is livid.

On closer inspection, these turned out to be tiny pin-holes in the metal layer, which appears to be melting away. Disc 2 (special features) seemed perfectly fine.
The disc still plays well, but I suspect that in the near future the holes will get big enough to defeat the error-correction function of the player. Needless to say, there is no legal way of creating a back-up copy of the disc while it still works - I seem to recall an offer to upgrade old DVDs to Blu-ray for a small fee, but it doesn't seem to be available now.",1318723200,,739,4.323741007194244

2504861,4,B000E6EK3S,"The Quiddich World Cup - what's not to like. This movie starts out at this World Cup event, and to be totally honest I only wish they had have made the whole movie set there. I could have sat and watched hours of Quidditch games and the fans and the like. This movie has a couple of my all-time favourite Harry Potter lines in it. 1. Harry Potter's: ""I love magic"" and 2. (when Ron and Harry are fighting and getting Hermione to pass on the messages to one another): ""I'm not an owl"". Absolute classic Harry potter one-liners. The movie itself is pretty exciting and stretches the borders of the magic-world to include two other schools. Having read the books I actually think that this rendition is comparable to the novel and does it justice. A point of displeasure is that the characters really seem to start going through a particularly annoying teenage-stage in this movie, which is painful to watch at times. More magic, less real-life soap-opera drama I say!",1312156800,,965,4.616279069767442

2504863,3,B000E6EK3S,"To me, HP4 is the weakest in the series. It's kinda boring and doesn't have too much of a plot. This year, Hogwarts host the Triwizard Tournament, in which one wizard from each of the three magical schools competes in three challenges. The champions are selected by the Goblet of Fire, a magical cup into which the candidates' names are placed. When the three are picked, a fourth name comes out of the goblet; Harry Potter. Each task is very dangerous. After the first task, there is a Yule Ball and shows that Hermione is beginning to fall for Ron. During the last task, Harry will come face-to-face with Voldemort reborn. If you love the series, I'm sure you'll love HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE!!!",1311033600,,708,4.582677165354331

This is great for a harry potter collector and found that the price difference for this compared to the regular blu-ray was worth it because of the collectible material as well as the extra footage.",1310947200,,528,4.557894736842106
2504865,2,B000E6EK3S,"After the extended cuts presented in volumes 1 and 2 of the ultimate edition releases (which are indeed the only reasons I began collecting the ultimate editions), volumes three to six are incredibly disappointing. If you do not own the films, or do not own them on blu-ray, the ultimate editions may be worth purchasing and for this I am giving it an extra star beyond the first. However, the precedent set in the first 2 releases leaves this one so incredibly disappointing that I feel I was cheated out of my money when I ordered volumes 3-6 to watch before the DH2 premiere.",1310515200,,578,4.5673076923076925
2504866,5,B000E6EK3S,"Although splitting The Deathly Hallows into two films was indeed a necessary move which certainly allowed for more breathing room, the Goblet of Fire probably stands as the strongest single-film adaptation of the Potter novels.  Screenwriter Steve Kloves brilliantly streamlined the busy story into an eloquent and well-paced screenplay, and director Mike Newell does a fantastic job at balancing the humour and darkness of the story.

While it is unfortunate that the removal of the house-elf subplot does deprive Hermione of some character elements, it was ultimately a wise move.  Otherwise, the film could easily have become cluttered and disjointed, but by focusing on the Tournament the story unfolds in a brisk, beautiful way.

Many complain that too much gets removed from the Potter films, but I disagree.  Film is a very different medium than print, and sprawling subplots do not translate well to the screen.  Indeed, Chris Columbus's heavy-handed direction of the first two films, both of which plod along at unbearable paces, could easily have ruined the entire series.  Thankfully, Alfonso Cuaron came along and made sure that Prizoner of Azkaban was a strong film, not just a bland carbon copy of what was on the page.  Mike Newell continues in that mold to great effect.

Each Potter film is definitely worth a watch, but it is my view that Goblet of Fire stands as the strongest entry in this impressive series.",1309219200,,1428,5.068376068376068

I can wait patiantly until WB puts out a box set of ALL 8 films, LOADS of sparkly extra content and all, like I did with The Lord of the Rings trilogy. It was well worth the wait. Whether or not it has the extended version may change. Maybe by then WB will catch the hint and put them in. Any excuse to jack up the price, right?

2504889,4,B000E6EK3S,I love this DVD set; the special features are amazing.  However I am disappointed because the film version is not the extended version.  That is not cool at all.  The first 3 films of the ultimate editions do include the extended version of each film in the first dvd.  I am not sure why the 4th one does not.  It sucks spending so much money on this set and I have to go to special features to view extended scenes.  :( :( :(,1300492800,,426,4.072289156626506

2504891,3,B000E6EK3S,"I kept putting off purchasing Years 3 & 4 of the Ultimate edition after having read multiple reviews, reporting that WB did not include the extended versions of the films, which existed in Years 1 & 2. I too still have the WB's commercial, where they promise that each Ultimate edition set will contain extended versions. I have therefore felt cheated.
I have since decided to buy these two sets, but only for the following reasons: I've been patiently waiting for the Ultimate editions ever since Year 1 was filmed way back then (2001). I never bought neither the DVDs, HD-DVDs nor BluRays of the films so as to avoid double- or even tripple-paying once the maxed out box sets become available (as many people knew they would). Thus these Ultimate editions will be my first purchase of every HP film. I'd also like to keep the continuity in the boxes, collectables and the excellent extra materials from Years 1 & 2 box-stes. Finally, if the WB later audaciously decides to produce the extended versions of Years 3 & 4 and put them on sale without a swap-in option for the existing Ultimate edition box-set owners, I would feel forced to download them from some file-sharing service as I am already paying for them with this Ultimate box-set, as advertised, but not delivered by WB.
My only hope is that WB will not botch the final three Years and that Years 3 & 4 will be the only dark spots in they reputation.",1298851200,,1413,4.58893280632411
2504892,5,B000E6EK3S,"Lets see what creative images could I say I loved. The train ride with all the tasty neat sweets. I loved the chariot with the birds in the sky. I loved the portal that takes you to a renaissance fair with magic and fun. A tent that looks small from the outside but is a castle on the inside. I liked the expanding campy maze with the creeps and brainwash that it held. I liked the gillyweed that makes Potters neck have gills. I liked the ball and the rock out concert after. I liked the ease of Potter and his friends and their love for one another. I liked the neat potions and the magic classes. But real magic. The bowl with things from the past floating in the water. The huge bathtub with suds and a ghostly funny girl to talk to. The broom riding, the adventures with dragons and a challenge with outstanding magic. Dinners with extrodinare fare, sweets and sours. The dark and the fun all mixed together, a castle in a skyfilled valley with cliffs and mountains and magical life.",1298246400,,988,4.345945945945946
2504893,1,B000E6EK3S,"Total bummer. As a lot of people have said they won't be buying this and any future Ultimate Editions unless the Extended versions of each film are included and I agree with them. The first two HP films I purchased the Ultimate Editions mainly because the Extended Cuts were included along with the theatrical versions. Adding only a documentary is not reason enough to shell out 40 bucks or more for the same movie I already have on blu-ray.

The first two Ultimate Editions are truly beautiful sets. The artwork and all the extras really make these collector's items for any fan of this series and I was looking forward to purchasing all the films (again) on blu-ray. However, as much as I'd love to have these now, without the Extended Cuts, makes all the difference.

I hope someone at WB with enough clout sees this thread and hopefully some day soon we will be able to purchase THE truly ULTIMATE EDITIONS of ALL of the Harry Potter films.",1297468800,,945,4.585798816568047
2504894,1,B000E6EK3S,"This is just like the Azkaban Ultimate edition, no extended cut of the film and really cheap packaging that came ripped!

Sure it has some great extra docs, but after creating ultimate editions that include extended editions of the film with the great docs, this is a total let down and a rip off for the price. You should just be able to buy the extra documentaries for a much lower price since anyone who is buying this already has the film on blu-ray.

After this debacle I will not purchasing any more ultimate editions, and these, unlike the first 2 films, this disc is not an ultimate editions at all.",1295654400,,607,4.45945945945946

So if you already have the movie, this is not worth the money to purchase.  If you want to have ""extras"" that are really not that integral, then go for it.",1294185600,,290,4.333333333333333
2504896,1,B000E6EK3S,"I confess I too was horribly disappointed to learn that the latest installations of the ""Ultimate Editions"" of Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban and the Goblet of Fire would not be released in extended cuts. I had placed both of these films on my ""wishlist"" for Christmas. I immediately contacted my family members and told them to scratch them off of that list. I would not have people I care about wasting nearly $80 of their hard earned money on movies that I already own. It is sad too, those movies had great additional scenes - one of my favorites being Snape busting students at the Yule Ball (in the Goblet of Fire) for snogging outside. I couldn't wait to see that added back into the movie.

I have read the statements where Warner's claimed that the directors from films 3 and 4 declined to add these scenes back in. Whether this is true or not is irrelevant. The extended versions of these movies exist on ABC Family, which means that someone somewhere HAS re-edited the films to include these scenes. Why didn't Warner's use those versions for an extended version disc? The ABC Fam versions are obviously ""legal"" since they show them regularly.

Personally, I am no great fan of all the ""extras"". The only thing that tempts me into buying a movie i already own is if the film is going to be extended, and they interview the actors that I like to discuss some aspect of their character. In the case with these films, neither occurred. They didn't have extended versions of the movie nor interviews with Alan Rickman (or many of the other older actors). One thing needs to be noted by the studio here...not all Harry Potter fans are children. Some of us are adults who enjoy watching the trained thespians in the films that we have enjoyed for decades. Sometimes I feel like we are slighted when it comes to these boxed sets. ALL the materials seem to be geared toward children. I don't mind some interviews with the younger actors, but they need to also accommodate the older viewers. As with the UK versions of the books, they should have Child and Adult versions of the films. ""Adult"" meaning that the extras would contain information that viewers beyond their teenage years would",1294099200,,2201,4.626598465473146
2504897,1,B000E6EK3S,There is an extended version and this is not it. It is on television all the time. Clever of the WB to make the first two extended and not the next two. I assumed they were extended and bought them.,1294012800,,198,3.975
2504898,4,B000E6EK3S,"""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is perhaps my favorite of the Harry Potter movies. It's fast, funny and character driven -- and features some of the best action sequences of the series so far. But as this release uses the same transfer as the original standard definition Blu-Ray, the film alone isn't a reason to buy this Ultimate Edition. It's the extraordinary hour long documentary on the second disc that makes this release worth the premimum price. Part four of an eight part documentary on the making of the Harry Potter series, this feature delves into all facets of the musical scores and sound effects from the first six Harry Potter films. Exclusive, high-definition interviews will all three composers on the series makes this a special treat. It was particularly fascinating to hear what they each had to saw about the work of the other two. Lots of others involved in the movies in general -- including cast members Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Bonnie Wright -- and the production of the music in particular are interviewed as well. Easily the best documentary I've seen on any aspect of the Harry Potter series so far, I highly recommend it to everybody who's interested in the Harry Potter movies or how films are scored.",1293840000,,1248,4.809302325581395
2504899,5,B000E6EK3S,"Daniel Radcliff's acting in this one seems a bit forced at times, but overall the characters are believable. Comparing it to the book would be an insult to the book because as with almost all ""book to movie"" movies, it was missing some key elements. However, my favorite part of the book was missing, and it's not a key element. The book, Harry Potter and the Order of the Pheonix, contain the best Quidditch match ever. I was disappointed that it wasn't represented in the movie. Of the first four movies, this one ranks supreme with the action and graphics.",1293667200,,559,4.6
2504900,5,B000E6EK3S,"The Goblet of Fire (the book) was much more difficult (and still is) to adapt into a film than its predecessors. For example, The Goblet of Fire (Goblet) is 300 pages longer than Prisoner of Azkaban (Prisoner), and even Prisoner could not have all its content included in the movie. Therefore, like the other films, it's best to judge Goblet as a film in its own right rather than as an adaptation of the book. After all, it's impossible to include everything. My personal rating for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is 5 out of 5 stars. The reasons: The film introduces the TriWizard Tournament, one of the highlights of the Harry Potter series. I love to read about and watch the 4 champions competing for the prize. It's always fun to guess the next task. The Yule Ball is nothing short of hilarious. Another reason is that the acting in this film has gotten even better with the passage of time. Additionally, the suspense has grown greater. SPOILERS AHEAD!!!!

Voldemort comes back at the end of the film. A tragic death occurs. The year doesn't end happily for Harry like the other three years did. We are all left wondering what will happen next. This makes us very eager to watch the next film, Order of the Phoenix. The film certainly does a great job of setting up the events of the next films and is entertaining in its own right. There are many funny moments though. Examples are Rita Skeeter and Ron receiving his new dress robes (poor Ron!).

SPOILERS END NOW!!!!

In conclusion, I would rate Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire just as satisfying and great as the other films in the series. Thank you for reading my review.",1292976000,,1641,4.537162162162162

2504905,3,B000E6EK3S,"Due to his commitment with post-production on Prisoner of Azkaban, Alfonso Cuaron opted to step down as director for the fourth Harry Potter film, Goblet of Fire, allowing another director to take the reigns. Mike Newell, best known for Four Weddings and a Funeral and Donnie Brasco, became the first British director of the series. Posessing an intimate knowledge of British boarding schools (having attended one himself) allowed Newell to deliver an accurate portrayal of boarding school life. In Newell's film, the kids act like kids; they aren't afraid of shouting their feelings when they feel they've been wronged, or resorting to fistfights when they feel it's necessary. Even more so than Cuaron, Newell adds a feeling of realism to the actions of Hogwarts' student body.

One thing I found interesting when comparing Prisoner of Azkaban to Goblet of Fire is that the former has a much darker tone in terms of cinematography and the overall feel of the film than the latter. This is interesting because in the previous Potter installment, our hero wasn't in any sort of real danger for the most part. We were just made to believe, like the characters in the film, that Harry was in danger throughout the entire story. Here, Harry finds himself in much more danger, his life on the line at multiple turns, but the tone is much lighter. There's also more comedy in this film, moments like Professor McGonagall teaching Gryffindor's fourth years how to dance with the help of Ron Weasley.

There are less new adult parts in this film than in previous installments, but the Harry Potter franchise still attracted great actors and actresses to join the cast. Madame Maxine of Beauxbatons is played by multiple Laurence Olivier Theater Award-winner Frances de la Tour, and the amazing Brendan Gleeson (28 Days Later..., Gangs of New York) portrays Alastor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody. Goblet of Fire also attracted quality actors to play the younger parts. Among them are the then-almost-unknown Robert Pattinson (now, unfortunately, best known for his role in the Twilight series) playing the role of Cedric Diggory, Bulgarian-born Stanislov Ianevski as Viktor Krum, and Clmence Posy as Fleur Delacour. They all do an admirable job of portraying these distinct characters.

Goblet of Fire is a fun film to watch, but of the movies that have come out so far I think I have the most problems with this film. I understand Newell fought the studio to keep this film as one rather than splitting it into two films, and I respect that, but there were way too many scenes that were over-dramatized. Harry's first task against the Hungarian Horntail was extended way beyond what it should have been, and Harry's venture into the lake during the second task of the Tri-wizard tournament was slightly overwrought as well. These may seem like petty arguments but these scenes took time away from other plots or subplots that could have furthered the overall story of the movie.

That's not even my biggest gripe with the movie. The problem I most have with this movie is the characterizations. Michael Gambon, playing Dumbledore, never read the Harry Potter books and never felt the need to. This is very apparent in the way he attacks Potter when his name appears in the Goblet of Fire. The reaction has more in common with a regular school headmaster than a seemingly all-knowing wizard. The worst issue here, though, is the portrayal of Barty Crouch, Jr. Played by David Tennant, who would go on to play Dr. Who, we're never left to wonder about Barty's guilt or innocence as we did in the book. From the first moment we see him we have no doubt that he's a Death Eater. We also learn at the end of the movie that he's an Azkaban escapee, but no mention is made in the movie of anyone looking for him, while the last movie dealt with an Azkaban escapee that everyone in the wizarding world was looking for. This inconsistency is explained in the book, and, had they spent less time over-dramatizing certain parts of Goblet of Fire, it could have been clarified in the film as well.

Goblet of Fire saw a rise in box office receipts, becoming the second-highest grossing film of the series up to this point with $895.9 million worldwide, also making it the highest grossing film of 2005. The promise of more action, more comedy, and the return of Voldemort in a fully corporeal form may have helped. While Goblet has more than its fair share of problems, its probably the most fun to watch of the films thus far, and up to this point the finale is the best of the series.",1290556800,,4553,4.78017789072427

2504909,4,B000E6EK3S,"Harry Potter has known for years that Lord Voldemort wants to destroy him, but in this episode the knowledge comes home in a very personal way.  When Hogwarts is chosen as the site of the Triwizard Tournament and hosts teams from two other wizard schools, students under the age of 17 are specifically forbidden from entering their names in the competition--but somehow Harry's name ends up in the running, and what's more he's accepted.  This causes considerable tension and partisanship among Hogwarts students and leads to a serious break between Harry and his buddy Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), which is only worsened by their realization that Hermione (Emma Thompson) isn't just a grindy girl any longer.  That, in turn, leads to trouble with fellow competitor and Qudditch star Viktor Krum (Stanilav Ianevski), and to a triangle involving Harry, Cho Chang (Katie Leung), and competitor Fleur Delacour (Clemence Poesy).  In the end Harry learns just how--and by whom--the draw was rigged and must face Voldemort on a more dangerous footing than ever before.

Given the length of the original book, a good deal unfortunately gets left out of the movie.  One of the high points, for example, is the Quiddith World Cup sequence, which is far too short (the impression I got is that the games are never even finished before Voldemort's Death Eaters put in an appearance).  Meanwhile a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, the former Auror ""Mad-Eye"" Moody (brendan Gleeson), arrives at Hogwarts, and two former prisoners at Azkaban, Igor Karkaroff (Pedja Bjelac) and Barty Crouch, Jr. (David Tennant), play vital parts.  Harry also discovers how unpleasant publicity can be when Rita Skeeter (Miranda Richardson), the aptly-named (she's both pestiferous and persistent) Daily Prophet reporter who has come to Hogwarts to cover the ""human-interest"" aspect of the games, turns out to be a gossipmonger and a distorter of everything that's said to her.  This is also the literal midpoint of the series and the place where it begins to turn much darker and scarier, foreshadowing the tests and trials still to come.  As has been pointed out before, kids who started reading the Potter books or watching the films when they first appeared should be old enough to handle everything, but the youngest ones, who don't have the advantage of growing into Harry's adventures along with him, may need a year or two before they can do as well.",1290124800,,2435,5.034825870646766

In fact, the latest CD doesn't even sound like an HP soundtrack, with only the very barest of reference to Hedwig's Theme in a couple tracks.

2504928,4,B000E6EK3S,"Early on in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, the fourth adventure for Harry and his friends, longtime fans of the series will notice a distinct absence.  Unlike in the past three films, The Goblet of Fire begins with Harry waking from a bad dream at his friend Ron's house, rather than at Uncle Vernon's suburban home.  Alas, I cannot say I miss Uncle Vernon's plump visage.  Not only was he a domineering philistine, but Vernon also seemed like a cartoonish throwback to the first two installments.  After the darker shades of The Prisoner of Azkaban, it's difficult to see where Vernon might fit within the increasingly doleful series.

 In many ways The Goblet of Fire fulfills the promises made by The Prisoner of Azkaban.  Knowing that multiple directors have taken the helm of this series, I at first expected a radical swing in tone and style with each changing of the guard.  I've been surprised to find that, despite the darker atmosphere in Azkaban, the evolution of the series has been deftly executed, suggesting a large amount of foresight.  I'm sure much of the credit must go to the books.  It is my understanding that Rowling let each installment grow along with her young readers.

 The Goblet of Fire not only treads in a tenebrous atmosphere and storytelling, but it also manages to expand the scope of Harry Potter's world outside the bounds of Hogwarts.  We find that Harry is spending the night at his friend Ron's house so that he can go see the Quidditch World Cup with the Weasley family.  Here we are given a glimpse of the multitudes of wizards from around the world, from neighboring Ireland to distant Bulgaria.  Unfortunately, the festivities are cut short when a legion of Voldemort's followers, called The Death Eaters, make like quidditch hooligans and bust up the joint.

 Back at Hogwarts, the school is gearing up for the Triwizard Tournament, an event where students from different schools compete in three tests of mental and physical acumen.  The champions are chosen at random by a magical goblet that is perpetually ablaze.  Each student who wishes to compete must write his name on a piece of paper and place it in the fire.  On the appropriate day, the goblet will spit out the names of the chosen students.  This year, however, only students seventeen or older may compete in the tournament (presumably getting insurance for the younger wizards is somewhat of a pain).  A spell is even placed on the goblet to prevent those under seventeen from placing their names in the flame.  And yet, when the time comes to choose the contestants, Harry Potter's name is shot out of the goblet despite the fact he both never entered his name and was incapable of doing so.

 How and why Potter was entered into the competition serves as the central mystery of Goblet of Fire, but, as with the other installments, Harry must also figure out the vagaries of growing up.  The friendship between Harry, Ron and Hermione is tested throughout.  Ron becomes jealous of Harry when he is mysteriously entered into the Triwizard Tournament, and Hermione becomes miffed with Ron after he half-heartedly asks her out to the school dance.  Not all of these conflicts are easily smoothed over, either.  While Ron and Harry eventually come to an understanding, a similar truce is never made between Hermione and Ron.  In fact Ron says a few things to Hermione that suggests he might be closet misogynist.  Needless to say, strained friendships are a part of being a teenager.  It's to the film's credit that the school dance is treated not so much as a rite of passage, but rather as the stiff and awkward social occasion that, for most, they are.  Ron and Harry have difficulties finding partners for the dance, and when they do, it turns out the two boys are bad dates.  Hermione attends the dance with Viktor Krum, one of the contestants in the Triwizard Tournament, but what could have been a resplendent evening turns ugly when Ron starts taunting her.  Leave it to a Harry Potter film to avoid turning a middle school dance into an evening of magic.

  Hogwarts once again hires a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.  Of all the rotating characters who have filled this position it is Goblet's Alastar ""Mad Eye"" Moody who is perhaps my favorite.  He gets his ""Mad Eye"" nickname from a false left eye that jets up and around, seemingly independent of its twin and capable of looking through the back of his skull (a useful skill for a teacher).  Needless to say, he's an eccentric character who shuffles about on a metal leg, tortures animals as a lesson for the class and brazenly takes swigs from his flask while in front of his students (my high school teachers at least hid their liquor in their morning cup of coffee).  In other words, Moody seems like a fun guy to take on a night on the town.

 Of course, the biggest surprise in the film is the final reveal of a fully recharged Voldermort.  This time he's not just some face on the back of someone's head or a mystical projection.  Without giving too much away, I will say that he is played with gusto by Ralph Fiennes.  Interesting enough, one of the first things Voldemort does upon being released into the world is to go into a ""what have you done for me lately"" routine against his followers.  When one of them protests that he helped Voldermort out of his exile, Voldermort sneers that this was done more out of fear than fidelity.  I guess pure evil is codependence.

 At the end of the film Hermione forlornly tells her friend, ""Everything's going to change now, isn't it?""  She might as well have been talking to the audience.  As the films become increasingly bleak, it has become more difficult to tell where the story will take us.  I for one, am curious to see where we shall end up.",1288828800,,5787,4.660414610069101

Being a hardcore Harry Potter fan for the past 10+ years had led me to purchasing this Ultimate Edition (along with Prisoner of Azkaban's) without reading any description about this edition having NO EXTENDED VERSION like the last two previous movies had. This ""ultimate"" edition comes with three DVDs, two of which were in the 2-Disc Special Edition that was released when GoF first released in DVD form (and which many people, including myself, already own). The price of this set of DVDs is only for the last disc, which is about the Sound in the Harry Potter world along with a few collectible cards and a photobook. I find this very disappointing because I am so sure that they could do a lot better than this. Putting the deleted scenes onto a separate disc (like how SS and CoS Ultimate Editions had) won't take WB that much time and money but they failed to do so, making the buyers feel like they have been ripped off. I am sure the HP crew have so much more contents filmed in the past 10 years that the movies were filmed, why do they keep those scenes to themselves? Most of the contents on this edition were seen by all the HP fans that follow this series' journey. I seriously don't know what WB is playing at because I feel like I have been ripped off for the contents. I guess this is worth the buy since I want everything Harry Potter but I just wish they put more contents in these ""ultimate"" editions.

2504940,1,B000E6EK3S,"When Warner Bros. introduced this ultimate edition set last year my wife was thrilled. Naturally I ordered them for her as she is a huge Harry Potter fan, and I enjoy the movies as well. When we received the first 2 Ultimate Edition movies we were blow away by both the packaging and the amount of extra content included. For the first time in a long time we felt like we were really getting our money's worth and eagerly awaited the next two movies. Well the day the movies became available for pre-sale I slapped our order in and we anxiously awaited the release. Now a few weeks ago I did a little browsing online and realized that neither of the two Ultimate edition movies releasing this year contained extended editions of the movie, which was one of the main reasons we purchased the set last year. We've owned both the HD-DVD years 1-5 special box set, and then upgraded to the Blu-Ray version(still own these). After discussing it with my wife, she decided she still wanted the Ultimate Edition's this year (3 and 4) so I kept our preorder. Well today we received the products in the mail, and before I get into anything else I have to rant a little bit.

First thing I noticed with this years Ultimate Editions, the boxes are MUCH lower quality than last years. My wife unwrapped year 3 and the way they have it packaged is very flimsy and easy to tear, which she did. They added a holographic cover to both movies this year which looks great, but the way they have it packaged its going to rip and tear if you plan on watching your movies.

Gone is the magnetic snap that clasped the case shut in years 1 and 2.

Both of these ""Ultimate"" Edition movies seem to be cheapened and lesser in quality not to mention the lack of extended editions of hte movie which is why MOST people purchased them in the first place.

Warner Bros. knew that people were going to buy these, especially those that had already slapped down the money for Years 1 and 2. Late last week I wrote a letter to Warner Bros. asking them why they decided to not include the extra content from the movies that we know exists (it runs on the family channel).

I do NOT suggest picking up Years 3 and 4, even if you already own years 1 and 2. 1 and 2 are totally worth the money, and are great sets even if you own the first two movies because they add to them. These sets add nothing are not worth the cost, and ruin what could have been an excellent set to own..

So we will get the continued documentary and a couple of extras that are pretty pointless and the same movie we have always had.  No matter what the reason was for them releasing it this way, it is very disappointing because they advertised the entire series to be coming out as EXTENDED....I bought the first two (after already owning them on regular edition DVD) only to find out it was a waste of time because the rest of the series may not be extended... what's the point?",1287360000,,712,4.5390625

What's frustrating as a consumer is that I did get the first two Ultimate Editions, and was looking forward to completing the collection of extended cuts.  I know, I know...  The studio gave the directors a chance to re-edit their films, and both directors felt the film that exists was the best cut, ergo no extended cuts are necessary.  Nobody bothered to ask what the FANS actually want.  Crazy thought...  All I have to say is, they better not screw up the Order of the Phoenix Ultimate Edition.  Everyone KNOWS that film had a full HOUR of stuff cut, footage that had been COMPLETED with effects and everything.  So, you've got no excuses, WB!

2504951,5,B000E6EK3S,"Now in his fourth year at school, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) becomes unwittingly involved in the infamous ""Tri-Wizard Tournament,"" wherein champions from Hogwarts and two visiting wizard schools face frightening challenges in the hope of winning eternal glory.  With help from his buddies Ron and Hermione, Harry battles dragons, survives underwater, and faces a terrifying maze.  Equally scary for him:  He must choose a date for the Yule Ball.  He has his eyes on the lovely Cho Chang but is too shy to ask her.  Lord Voldemort and his Deatheaters play a prominent part in this installment as Harry faces a life and death duel.

The movie is very well written and the acting is good, too.  The three kids are now playing 14-year olds and are showing a greater range of emotions.  There is much humor when it comes to dealing with the opposite sex, a talent the usually capable Harry seems to lack.  Watching the three at the Yule Ball is sweet and awful, as these things tend to be at that age.

The soundtrack and special effects are wonderful as usual and the suspenseful story is acceptable and enjoyable for children over eight as well as older audiences.  If you're a Potter fan, you're sure to enjoy ""Goblet of Fire.""  This is the best of the series so far and definitely lives up to all expectations.",1283385600,,1314,4.689956331877729
2504952,5,B000E6EK3S,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a truly epic movie, with thrills, excitement, and emotion, that never disappoints and really brings the Wizarding World to life. This film really entertained me, and is a welcome restoration of the Potter magic for anyone who disliked the dreary, overly-depressing feel of ""Prisoner of Azkaban"".

I was fortunate enough to see this film on its opening day of November 18, 2005, and to this day, five years on, I still think it is one of the best out of all the films and my favorite movie out of the whole series. As a humongous fan of the books and the first two films, I wasn't going to miss seeing this one, and was given a pleasant surprise upon discovering how good it was.

It's no easy feat adapting a hulking 734-page novel to a workable two-and-a-half-hour production that doesn't lag, nor run by too quickly and feel rushed. The filmmakers did a splendid job in balancing things out so you don't feel as if the whole thing has been butchered. It keeps moving, but does not go at such a break-neck speed as films five and six do so that there isn't time to relax and enjoy things like the music, the scenery, or the more intimate interactions between characters.

Obviously, with a book that large, you're going to have to cut out something, and I for one feel that the proper choices were made in doing away with several rather pointless sub-plots (Hermione's S.P.E.W initiative, for example, which I was glad was cut because it made her seem a little childish and annoying; or the character of Ludo Bagman, which made the story longer than it should have been) to give the narrative a more continuous thread. Even with the cuts it stays surprisingly faithful, so it won't disappoint fans, and it successfully retains the novel's spirit while also managing to remake itself into a film that flows nicely and may even rival the book.

Nothing can be entirely flawless, but ""Goblet"" comes close. Everything was done right, from the pacing to the casting to the music to the directorial decision. In short, one couldn't ask for a better film. The director, Mike Newell, as well as the screenwriter Steven Kloves, really chose to emphasize the real feeling of a British boarding school, as well as increasing the drama of the darkness concerning Lord Voldemort's return to power. The TriWizard Tournament is expanded to heroic proportions, and is one-hundred times more exciting than what was originally written, which makes watching this film even more interesting to anyone who is already familiar with the book.

The visual look of the film is amazing, and even better than what I could have imagined. Hogwarts has this golden glow to it, and feels incredibly warm and cozy, the kind of place you always imagined it to be, but up till this point had never seen before in any of the previous films. The cinematography is beautiful, and the special effects are perhaps the most effective we've seen in any of the films.

The music Patrick Doyle has written is breathtaking. With this score, he's created another gem. It is right up there with John Williams in the magic department, but is more tuneful and romantic. Let's just say you might be humming the songs right out of the theatre.

As far as acting goes, everyone, the adult actors included, are better than ever. After five years, everyone seems to have really slipped imperceptibly into their characters, so that it's difficult to separate the performance from the reality. The younger actors, particularly the three main stars, have really improved in the capabilities, and give astounding performances that are filled with insight and pathos.

Daniel Radcliffe especially has come a long way from the wide-eyed little 11-year-old he was when the series started. I thought his performance in ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" was a little stilted and lacking, even in comparison with the first two films, in which he was very good. Here, he brings a sensitivity and courageousness to Harry that even J.K. Rowling hasn't been able to put across as well. Harry still has his flaws, but he is easier to relate to. He is also a bit smarter, which was a great improvement; he's too dull in the books and gets on your nerves after a while because of his sheer stupidity!

Ralph Fiennes gives a chilling performance as Lord Voldemort, and if you aren't as creeped out as I was seeing him in full regalia, then you'd better go back and watch the scene in the graveyard a few more times.

There is absolutely nothing I can find that I didn't like about this film, except the inclusion of the heavy rock numbers during the Yule Ball scenes (I found them terribly out of place, even though the Weird Sisters band were included in the novel; but then again, I'm not one of those people who enjoys that sort of music); but aside from that, everything else was perfect, and I highly recommend this film.",1282780800,,4887,4.711943793911007
2504953,3,B000E6EK3S,"This is the only Harry Potter film with an ""international"" twist. Watching and analyzing the film we can get insights on how the English-speaking world relate to the other three great European cultures - the German, the Russian and the French. While the French in the movie are not disguised, the German and the Russian cultures are ""magically"" fused into one - they are thinly veiled as the Bulgarians of the Durmstrang Institute. I am referring to the central event of the movie - the so-called Triwizard Tournament which is a magical contest between the wizarding schools of Europe - the Hogwarts, the Durmstrang Institute of ""the North"", and Beauxbatons Academy of Magic.

The Beauxbatons Academy of Magic represents the Francophone culture in the Harry Potter Universe. They have a soft touch and a certain ""je ne sais quoi"". Their Headmaster is Madame Maxime is very tall and looks vaguely like Charles de Gaulle. The name ""Beaux btons"" is French for ""beautiful wands"". But with the other school - the Durmstrang Institute - things are more complicated.
The name indicates ""Sturm und Drang"", a German term for ""emotional turmoil"", a codeword for the German romanticism. The students are all boys with military-style buzzcut, apparently meaning to represent the Prussian militarism during Word War I. The names like Viktor Krum are Germanic. Bur their headmaster's name Igor Karkaroff is undoubtedly Russian. He is portrayed as an unpleasant and brutish character with bad teeth looking like someone who just walked out the ""Ivan the Terrible"" movie try-outs for the mad Tsar Ivan. The Prussians and Russians are fused together in an unpleasant cocktail.

The Durmstrang's coat of arms features a double headed eagle, indicating that the school may be located in the Russian or Austro-Hungarian Empire. Victor Krum attended the ""Yule Ball"" with Hermione Granger looking like the young Wilhelm II wearing the Austrian hussar regiment uniform. Kaiser Wilhelm's middle name was Viktor, by the way.

We are shown how the ""Anglo-Saxons"" successfully compete with other cultures. How they do it? Well, with their honesty, pragmatism, and principle of ""fair-play"" boosted by Harry Potter magical powers. They overcome the ""la finesse"" of the South and ""la ruse"" of the Northerners - the Russo-Germans. They triumphed because the others are lacking some ingredient or another (for example, intelligence). It's all ""de bonne guerre"", good fun, and ""Karkaroff"" is a clever though nonsensical name for a Russian (""Kar-Kar"" is a sound made by ""Russian"" crows, as opposite to ""Caw-Caw"" in the English-speaking countries). But stereotypes are easily discernable. You ask, so what? My point is that the ideology, which goes hand in glove with cultural stereotypes, is everywhere. Even in movies for kids.",1282176000,,2794,5.21826280623608

As Harry goes back to school, an upcoming TriWizard tornument is at hand soon for three schools of wizardary known as Hogwart's, Beauabatons and Durmstrang but only people who are 17 can join the tornument. A magical object called The Goblet of Fire choses who can be in the competetion as Harry has been chosen luckily to be the youngest member of the TriWizard tornument, with the help of not-so-trust worthy Professor Moody (Brendan Gleeson) with fellow student Cedric (Robert Pattison) to do 4 important task in order to become part of the match especially if he has to battle Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes).

Co-starring Miranda Richardson, Michael Gambon, Gary Oldman, Maggie Smith, Warwick Davis, Robbie Coltrane, Katie Leung, Jason Issacs, and Tom Felton  this is another outstanding installment of the Harry Potter fantasy epic saga.

Here it gets more complex yet full of mystery and suprises galore, the special effects are very improved as well making them more belivable and there's darkness abound in this sequel.

2504993,5,B000E6EK3S,"Up to the point when this movie was originally released, this was the best out of the four. Being one of the longest books in the series, it was plainly clear to me that a lot was going to get cut out. In fact, pretty much all of the sub-plots are gone, making Harry (of course) the focus of the film instead of going into these pointless directions. For those who haven't read the books and have only seen the films, I don't find it necessary that we see Hermione preaching about the rights of house elves, Harry living at the Dursleys (I think after three movies, the audience gets that they're cruel to him) and the Weasleys taking him for the summer and the Quidditch World Cup. Much like my complaint about Ian Fleming describing eighteen excruciating holes of golf in Goldfinger and the movie version trimming it to the last two holes, you can't expect an audience to sit around and watch and still find the main story interesting. Another prime example of sub-plot cutting is Peter Jackson's adaptations of three LOTR books. If he had included Tom Bombadil's scenes, the audience would probably be still be watching Fellowship for at least another hour. Now that that rant's over, lets move on to the cast. Main cast is still excellent, and now they've finally discovered the opposite sex, which leads to some humorous moments and a stunning entrance by Hermione at the Yule Ball definitely made Harry and Ron's heads turn. Ralph Fiennes, who is practically unrecognizable under Voldemort's make-up (maybe he still feels ashamed for The Avengers), just oozes evil and I detect a hint of elegance in the character. Action sequences are some of the best though the dragon scene does drag a little but the fight with Voldemort is an exciting one. Patrick Doyle picks up the music department in this and, though ably picks up Williams' themes, adds his own touch to the franchise, making this a better score than the first two and just slightly better than the third.",1257638400,,1970,4.696531791907514

THis is the EXACT same as the special edition, and is getting sold for much more.  I expected some sort of illustrated cards or SOMETHING inside the package, but the fact is, I saw ZERO reviews on this that informed me of much of anything.  SO I thought I would write one.  In my opinion, it's not worth the extra for a card that is cheap, and I think it has a DVD ""insert"" inside (meaning instead of having a DVD on the cover section and the back, you have a middle section that both DVDs are fastened to) but it is plain black plastic.  Nothing extraordinary at all. In my opinion (that and a Dollar will buy you a cup o' coffee).  Save your money and get the special edition.

This movie is too rushed, trying to fit so much in that it leave gapping holes in the plot. Someone who has read the book might enjoy this movie as a visualization of some of the story's concepts, but to see this movie without the benefit of pre-reading would be a waste.

2505030,4,B000E6EK3S,"I was fortunate enough to catch a midnight showing of the latest installment in the Harry Potter series, and I must say it does not disappoint. Harry Potter has matured a great deal, along with his best friends, Hermione and Ron, who all share a great deal of emotional turmoil related to romance, friendship and death.

They have quite a bit of obstacles thrown at them, everything from magic to the green demon of jealousy, not to mention the overwhelming forces of Voldemort. Perhaps the most intriguing part of the film is the character development that is brought forth through the testing of the trio's friendship as their platonic feelings grow beyond into something more passionate and dangerous.

The Quidditch World Cup is wonderful, however brief it is, and as usual Potter's involvement in it is nothing short of extraordinary, especially his encounter with a scaly and ferocious creature. This time however, the game goes beyond the traditional matches, and actually becomes a matter of life and death, which takes the film down a much deeper and darker path than ever seen before.

By no means is this film for children any longer, as it has ventured into the territory of content for adolescents and adults. That's a good thing though, because the natural progression of their age and maturity is matched by that of the wickedness of the world that these characters inhabit, and as a result the character development is all the more significant. Their lives are no longer as innocent as they once were, and the dark forces in the world of Harry Potter take a more proactive approach in their power struggle, something which has far more dire consequences than that of the first three films.

Several new characters are introduced who add a great deal of substance to the plot, and as a result the previously existing relationships are permanently altered, becoming more complex than that of childish innocence. Potter's new mentor for example sort of leads Potter down a nefarious path, which is the only way Potter has a chance to stand up to the imminent confrontation of his greatest foe. His inner demons grow in numbers, and it's obvious that Potter is no longer as benevolent as he once was.

The special effects and setting never disappoint, which complement the film just as effortlessly as before. I must give credit to the new director Mike Newell who has a deep understanding of the more disturbing and adult nature of this 4th chapter in the series.

I wouldn't say that this movie is better than the others, but it's definitely a worthy successor and moves the plot along as well as one could expect. I definitely recommend this film to Potter fans and newcomers alike because it is completely entertaining from start to finish.",1238112000,,2756,4.853191489361702

2505075,1,B000E6EK3S,"The Harry Potter movies have been an everlasting source of comfort for me. I was always promised a good faithful script, nice acting, and stunning visuals. But....Something along the road didn't quite work for Goblet of Fire. What didn't work, however? The first three movies ran smoothly, were great, and didn't have any problems. What happened?

It's Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts, and sometime has passed since he last heard from Voldemort. But quite suddenly, Voldemort supporters start springing up, promising terrifying results. On top of that, Hogwarts is hosting the Tri-Wizard tournament; a Wizarding competition.....And Harry might just have his first crush....Now before I start with the bad, let me start off with the good....It's always best to start that way now isn't it?

Rupert Grint gives a solid performance as Ron Weasley. He might just be the best young actor in the entire cast. He delivers his lines precisely, as great facial expressions, and is just a way to watch on film. Robert Pattinson does a fine job as Cedric Diggory, and makes a welcome, (if not short) addition to the cast. Oliver and James Phelps are back as the two Twins, and are hilarious once again. Tom Felton shows true professionalism as he steals every scene he's in, even if he only has three lines in the entire movie!

As far as adult actors go, Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy and Alan Rickman as Severus Snape steal the scenes they're in. Jason is devilish as Mr. Malfoy, and nobody could play Severus as Alan can. But it's truly Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort that's the wonderous performance. Ralph has always been a favorite as mine, and he practically is Voldemort. Mr. Fiennes's acting is superb, as you find you can't take your eyes off of him....even if he has no nose....

But all reviews have to have a negative side; even in the case of Harry Potter.

I cannot fathom any idea as to what happened to Emma Watson. Her acting vastly improved in Prisoner of Azkaban, and she was showing promising results as Miss Granger. But suddenly, it was like as if she had suddenly taken a class on how not to act. In every scene Miss Watson is in, she's either A) Looking as if she's ready to cry, B) Getting ready to yell at someone, or C) Smirking very stupidly into the camera. What happened? As my title suggests... Perhaps it was the script? Surely the script however, does not give word for word what expression to use at every second however! Hermione Granger has left the building, and we have indeed been left with an empty shell.

The same thing goes for Daniel Radcliff; his acting even takes a detour! He only has one expression on the entire time of the movie, and comes across as very bland indeed. Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter was an atrocious mistake on every level. She hams the role up too much; the acting coming across much too over the top. Also, what was up with Dumbledore? I love the Michael Gambon as Dumbledore, but who decided to make him bland? He's supposed to be warm and fuzzy, but in this movie comes across very cold and unsympathetic. We can only blame this on a bad script.

The visuals in the film are nothing to write home about. Everything looks positively dark and dreary; which isn't very appealing to the eye. In turn this makes the viewer of the film bored, as stunning visuals grab the viewers; but there aren't any here. And I know Goblet of Fire is supposed to be dark, but is was too overly dark and depressing and not appealing to the eye at all.

It also seems the Magic takes a backseat in this flim. As another reviewer said, this movie is more like a movie about a School and Hormonal teens then it is about magic. The Yule Ball gets more screen time then it's worth; including a very stupid shot of Miss Watson walking down the steps in a pretty pink gown. The movie focuses more on Hormones and Death, and that's not what makes the Harry Potter franchise...Harry Potter.

Also, there's no Special Features. Seems you have to buy the 2-Disc special edition to get any. Which is bad if you already went and shelled out Twenty bucks for this version; to go out and shell out almost 40 is quite stupid indeed.

2505089,4,B000E6EK3S,"After Prisoner of Azkaban, this actually disappointed me. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't outstanding either. I'll do this pro/con.

Pros-
Great special effects, as always. Cedric Diggory actually made me a Hufflepuff fan. Daniel Radcliffe continues to impress. Rupert Grint is pretty funny. Emma Watson is as pretty as ever. The graveyard scene in the end was fantastic!!!!!!! And I really like Michael Gambon as Dumbledore. The music was good, and the Quidditch stadium at the World Cup was quite impressive.

Cons-
To begin with, the film doesn't start with Harry at 4 Privet Drive. While it isn't a huge deal, all the previous movies had, and the book did. Also, the movie ventured too far from the book. It almost relied on the audience to remember things from the book to fill in the plot holes in the movie. Ron's hair is hideous. The whole house-elf thing is completely taken out. They Hollywood-ized the first task, with Harry flying all over Britain being chased by a dragon. PLEASE! Oh, and I don't think they did the end of the book justice. I remember being on the verge of tears reading Dumbledore's ""remember Cedric"" speech at the end, but it's completely watered down in the movie.

Nevertheless, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" movie did not disappoint me and I am anxiously awaiting for the last two movies to become available (""... and the Order of the Phoenix"" also excellent!).

There are times when you think ""oh, sure"" but that's what Harry Potter is all about!  I can tell you that while reading the books a was shocked and saddened at times, laughing at other times, and always kept in suspense as to the ending.

If you are looking for entertainment that is not exactly like the book, you'll probably like this movie if you've liked the other HP movies, but quality was a bit lacking, hence 4 stars.

The main focus of the movie:  Quidditch world cup, BUT only really the part with the death eaters.  Triwizard Tournament ~ this took up the majority of the movie, the dragon scene (we don't get to see any of the others fight their dragons, only Harry), figuring out the clue from the golden egg and moaning myrtle in the bathroom, the 2nd event with the grindylows, etc. and then the final event with the maze and the final battle with voldemort.

2505111,5,B000E6EK3S,"Where as the first Potter film seemed geared towards young children,  Goblet of Fire nearly seems the opposite.  Not that kids won't enjoy this, though it may be very frightening at times for very young children.  But the teenagers and even adults may find this to be a perfect fit for more mature entertainment.  The tr-wizard tournament is practically the most dangerous event Potter has dealt with yet.  Then there is the formal ball, where both sexes have officialy grown up.  There is even some innuendo, which surprised me from a Potter film, but it was still amusing.  And perhaps death and the reality of it is the biggest impact this film offers.  Oh yes, and Voldemort comes back into full form, played by a deliciously creepy Ralph Fiennes.

This is one of my favorite Potter films because of how well balanced it was made.  Despite all the danger, fright and incredible CGI action, there is also humor and drama to balance out the equation.  It gives us a little bit of everything, which adds up to high interest and great pacing throughout.

The tr-wizard tournament is the highlight of the movie, with Potter and three others competing in a very deadly and real sport.  There are three scenarios that must be won, each more frightening and deadlier than the first.  The first obstacle is aquiring a golden egg protected by a very deadly dragon.  Harry, ends up against the deadliest of dragons in what provides a very suspenseful and action-oriented showdown.  The following scene takes place underwater, in a scene that feels very frighteneing and creepy.  The last obstacle is in a massive hedge maze, with quite the feel of Claustrophobia as the hedges seem to come alive.

I thought this was a huge improvement over the last film, Prisoner of Azkaban.  They succes to Goblet of Fire is that it gives us quite a bit of everything, and every scene seems to have a purpose, whether it be imprtance to the story or successfully entertaining.  Potter has definetly evolved into something that everyone can love, especially the grown ups.

2505115,5,B000E6EK3S,"Well to me, so far, this is my favorite Potter film, ahead of Order of the Pheonix which was also very watchable.  I'll admit, I fell asleep on Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets as the stories were too slow moving, perhaps set up for kids to slowly understand; but this forth film kept me interested.  I'm not going to do a book vs film comparison as I have not read the books, but from a theatrical standpoint this is the definitive Harry Potter movie.  Goblet of Fire one contains fun for kids, teens and adults whereas the first 2 films were mainly for kids.  I have not watched Prisoner of Azkaban (probably going to purchase this one next) in its entirety so I cannot pass a snore-review on that one, but from a film-making standpont this film also has succeeded in its goal to scare and captivate audiences to their seats.  In this film we see the maturitity of the Potter cast, it includes suspense, horror, comedy, adventure, action and overall fun-factor.

Director Mike Newell, placed a more serious and darker twist on the Potter series which sees the outcome of Potter as a true hero.  Harry is challenged by his nightmares, the Tri-Wizard competetion, and his friendship with Ron and Hariome.  Through all the trials and tribulations the audience watches as Harry matures and overcomes all odds with very little question and moderate help.

The cinematography is simply awesome.  Colors reflect emotions as you watch Harry's nightmares and also as Harry's name is chosen from the Goblet of Fire.  There are many cues in the story which serves a sort of a guide of whats to come.  This one is definitely worth watching more than once.  One scene that comes to mind is when Harry attempts to escape from the fire-breathing Horntail Dragon and capture a golden egg...WOW! Now this scene really pleases your surround sound system while boasting stunning visuals.  Ambient noises are also well positioned to take advantage of you rear surround channels.

If you are going to add any Harry Potter Movie to your HD DVD collection, this is the one to get.  It has 5 star story, picture and sound quality. The extras include a 30 minute interview with Harry, Hermione and Ron.  Also, as with all other films in the series for HD DVD, it includes The In Movie Experience aka 'the iciing on the cake.' Goblet of Fire is a must OWN!",1198886400,,2339,4.6658536585365855
2505116,5,B000E6EK3S,"I am not a fan of wizards and magic. I've never read a Harry Potter book, but for some reasonm I enjoy the movies very much. Maybe it is just nice to escape reality for a little while and root for a very unasuming hero. What I always seem to like about Harry Potter is that he always lands on top but seldom knows what he's doing. Also it's nice to see action movies without the typical muscle bound hero who leaves everything behind him in a fire of explosions.

The Goblet of Fire chooses who will compete in a TriWizard Tournament. Harry is not allowed to enter because of his age, but he ends up being entered as a fourth contestant. It is only at the end that we discover 'you know who' is behind it all for his own evil purposes, like being born again.

The wizard tournament events are spectacular, stealing a golden egg from a dragon, saving friends from mer-people, and the scariest hedge maze since The Shining.

Of course this flick has a sub plot about the kids at Hogwarts growing up and beginning to notice the opposite sex. A grand dance is given on Christmas Eve and those ackward moments are in abundance prior to and during. Harry may be able to fly a broom stick and outmaneuver a dragon, fight off underwater monsters, and face 'who know who' but he can't dance. You can't win them all.

Great flick with superb special effects that make you forget it's all computers.",1198800000,,1388,4.389105058365759

The first thing I have to say is ""VOLDEMORT RULES!!!"" Whoever played Voldemort did an excellent job and you really learn to hate him (which is a good thing if you learn to hate the character and not the actor).
The special effects rock and the acting is much better than I remember it being in the previous movies.
I can't say much about the story because there's nothing new under the sun. As usual the director cut things, added things, and shortened things so as to make it not nearly as good as the books, but that's to be expected with all films that are based off of books.

House Elves, Goblins a detailed plot and story line distinguish it from The Order of the Phoenix which is good on paper but looks like it was hastily put together on film with poor attention to continuity and special effects that are essential to HP Movies.

2505134,3,B000E6EK3S,"After the very good ""Prizoner of Azkaban"" HP attempts to keep to it's title, but unfortunately they placed their priorities wrong. I watched this film before I read the book, I didn't like it then and I don't like it now that I've read the book. Unlike the story suggests from the dark third one, ""Goblet"" focuses more on flimsy teen relations, and less on the evil that is growing around the school. At the end of the film, the most evil villain in the series is reincarnated, except through the tangled web of teens fighting, teens crying, teens going out, teens being stupid, this ending is deminished, at this point you say to yourself, ""who's this Voldemort guy who's being reincarnated?"" Then you have to remind yourself: ""Oh yeah! he's the evil creepo who's attempting to murder the main character and take over the world!, yeah I remember him!""..... urgh. The movies plot is mostly taken over by two of the main characters squabbling over going out and such, and if it's not taken over by that, it's consumes by Harry's conflicting emotions over his school crush Cho Chang. Ok, if you're a female teen who likes chick fliks you might like this, but if you're an actually fan of HP it's next to impossible to take this one seriously.

Well, there you have it. Goblet of Fire, you either like it or you don't, there isn't much of a middle ground to this situation. Oh well, at least they get it right in the next installment.....",1196035200,,1435,4.562015503875969

2505136,5,B000E6EK3S,"Year 4 turned into movie is more satisfying than Chris Columbus's version of year 1 and 2. Prisoner of Azkaban, year 3 is where the story gets darker and more realistic. Prisoner of Azkaban had a ground hog day touch to it. I found that Harry Potter has stopped being a kiddy adventure from year 3 onwards in the sense that it has got more adultish and realistic. This is due to the fact that the characters are growing up allowing them for more mature and logical actions . Chris Columbus made the 1 and 2 movies very cheerful in tone, bright and just apt for the kiddies. The story at that time (year1 and 2) had the gang as little kiddies (which is what they were back then). Azkaban changed the trend. And in here Mike Newell (from  Four Weddings and a funeral fame) creates a realistic movie in so far as the stunts and violence goes. Harry suffers bruises, people die ,and real death looms. This in part also because the story is writtent that way and also because the director chooses to emphasize that the movie and adventure is entering a darker tone. The cinematographys uses a dark charcoalish shade informing us of the impeding doom to come. The cinematography is as gothic, operatic and grand in scale as Azkaban was. The Yule ball is a nice interlude from the tri-wizard tournament and is reminescent of high school proms. Lovely book and a lovely movie. The complaint that movie is not true to the book is utterly stupid as you cannot faithfully translate a 700 odd page book into a movie. So you compress, and these guys have got it right. They compressed the right bits. At the end the 700 pg book has to work as a piece of film seen in over 2.5 hrs. And it works just right.

2505153,4,B000E6EK3S,"Overall, this is a very good film, if you're familiar with the books and prior movies.

The acting, effects, costumes and settings are wonderful, but this film doesn't quite make it as a movie.  Some parts seem more like dramatized scenes from the book than part of a coherent narrative.  I understand that it was necessary to leave out some subplots and narrative threads to bring this book to the screen -- the Harry Potter story at this point is so complicated, with so many complex characters and intertwining subplots, that it cannot be reduced to a few hours of film.  However, I missed many of the things that were cut out -- the house elf subplot, for example.  Winky's absence leaves viewers with no clue to how Crouch, Jr. managed to escape from Azkaban, or why Harry was suspected of casting the Dark Mark, for example.

I don't think anyone who hasn't read at least the first four books of the series and seen the prior movies could make sense of this one.  For those of us who know the books and prior films, however, this film is enjoyable to watch.  The interactions between the characters seems utterly believable, even when delicate dating issues are involved.

2505165,1,B000E6EK3S,"if you read the book, you will hate this movie. the books has several, strong story lines. the movie had to be condensed so much so, that it was completely obvious what was cut out, and what wasn't.

go to the wikipedia website, and you can see a comparision of both the book and the movie.

the movie as a piece of art sucked as well. in the first half an hour, i honestly couldn't keep my eyes straight. everything was so fast, that you didn't see the characters faces for more than a second. it was also very choppy. take a look at the scene where ron and hermione are mad at each other during the yule ball. right after that they are walking out of the ball room, without harry. that 2 minutes of film is so incredibly choppy, you know somehting was cut out.

the deleted scenes don't help either. even if you burned the movie together, you'll still be lost.

for those who didn't read the book, you may like this as a movie. but honestly, there wasn't enough to hold your interest, except the scenes with mad eye moody. i though dumbldore couldn't get any worse than movie 3 - i was wrong. this guy is awful. he obviously didn't read the book either.

2505176,4,B000E6EK3S,"For those who have only seen the movies and not read the books, there are no inconsistencies.  I find this very sad because I felt that this movie did the HP franchise a real disservice by changing a major plot point.  I flat out did not like that Barty Crouch Jr. had far more involvement in the movie than he did in the book.  I understand why this was done for the film but I felt like it was too large of a change.

Still, overall I felt that this was a good film, though not as good as PoA.  This is partially due to my belief that PoA in general is a stronger story than GoF but I also felt that PoA was a more effective movie.

What this film does right, it does very well.  I had been wondering how it would be possible to film the Quidditch World Cup scenes and I was really wowed by how it was actually done.  They were really breathtaking and so well done that I found myself fervently wishing for more of them.

On the other hand, what it does badly it does very badly.  I really, really disliked the entrances of Durmstrang and Beauxbatons.  I didn't find them lacking in drama and intrigue in the book and I really didn't see why it was necessary for the movie to have drawn the gender lines it did.  I hated how Durmstrang entered with a cheesy fire show last seen at your typical tourist luau and I absolutely abhorred how the Beauxbatons entrance was so hyper-sexualized.  This was so unnecessary and gratuitous that I found it detrimental to my enjoyment of this portion of the film.  I have no idea why the decision was made to make Durmstrang hyper masculine and Beauxbatons super girly when, in the book, there was no such sexist contrast.

It simply has to be said: I found Mad Eye's magical eye an effect that was too cheesy for words.  In the book it seemed an object of awe and one that was rather scary while in the movie it just looked silly.  It's a good thing Brendan Gleeson captured Mad Eye so utterly.  He prevented the ridiculous eye effect from making the character himself ridiculous.

These gripes aside, I thought the scenes of the Triwizard Tournament were very, very well done.  Though some of what was in the book was trimmed, I didn't miss it all that much.  The effects in some of these scenes were truly spectacular and if Harry being chased all around the castle by the dragon was a bit unnecessary it was really something to look at.

The graveyard scene was masterful, though.  A great deal of this is due to Ralph Fiennes's stellar turn as Voldemort.  His voice is perfect, a bit feminine and high and yet still very frightening.  The makeup artists clearly earned their pay with this character as he emerges from the cauldron looking so utterly repulsive and inhuman that it's impossible to recognize Fiennes.  This is certainly an important role in the series and I don't think they could have done a better job casting it.  Fiennes is truly malevolent.

The scene itself was also wonderfully done.  I found it to be rather intense and violent in the book and although I don't think the movie watered it down, it was far more psychological than graphic--which is certainly to its credit.  I never found Cedric Diggory all that involving as a character in the book but the heartless manner in which Voldemort cuts him down and Amos Diggory's violent grief upon viewing his son's body moved me to tears.  I was heartbroken watching Harry clinging to Cedric's body and Radcliffe really did a wonderful job of capturing Harry's guilt and anguish.",1187308800,,3491,4.467614533965245

2505178,3,B000E6EK3S,"The film gets credit for trying to cram a large, richly detailed book into two and a half hours, and making a fair attempt to follow the book at the same time.  It of course cuts out large parts of the book, alters others, and oddly slipping in scenes that weren't in the book at all, possibly because there was no need for the two visiting schools to enter the Great Hall performing interpretive dance. It could have also done without the five or six sweeping aerial shots of Hogwarts, usually following the tail of an owl, whose purpose seems mainly to take up time and show viewers where the film budget went.

However much effort the director might have put into this film, the book remains infinitely better, not least because of the treatment of Dumbledore. In the book, Dumbledore is calm, collected, reserved, and above all, seems to know everything. He's the person you can always count on to be there in a crisis or to explain things in the end. In this film, Dumbledore is uncharacteristically weak, unnerved, shaken, moody, and oddly violent. After Harry's name comes out of the goblet of fire, the book has Dumbledore calmly approaching Harry and asking him if he had put his name in the goblet. In the movie, Dumbledore runs into the room, grabs Harry, practically slams him against a table, and shouts, ""DID YOU DO THIS HARRY!?! DID YOU PUT YOUR NAME IN THE GOBLET?!? DID YOU HAVE ANOTHER STUDENT DO IT FOR YOU?!?! ANSWER ME!!"" Dumbledore fights with Fudge, slumps, and bungles. I'm not sure why, but his seems to be the only character to have suffered such a severe alteration. Dumbledore was old, but as pointed out several times in the book, he didn't act like it.

In addition, the film turns what was an unavoidable complication, letting underage Harry compete because the goblet chose him to compete, into a conspiracy to capture who put his name in, something not in the book and certainly not needed. The film also suffers from the usual Hollywood excess when it comes to special effects. In addition to the overzealous shots of owls and the expanding zoom shots of the exterior of the Triwizard stadium (which was supposed to be on the Hogwarts Quidditch field, not removed to the side of a mountain), there was the almost nauseating portkey sequence in the beginning, when what should have been a simple flash and they find themselves elsewhere, becomes a scene out of Star Trek, where they go flying through the air and into a wormhole-like thing, that leaves them flying through the air again and plummeting to the ground. Okay. Don't know what purpose that served.

And, even more annoying was the excessive time spent butchering the first task, where Harry and the others fight dragons. In the book, the dragons were nesting mothers would who be protecting their eggs, one of which was the golden egg the champions would have to steal. In the film, there was just this egg sitting amongst the rocks, and nothing was keeping the dragons from either eating the children or ignoring the egg (unlike with a nesting mother, whose priority would be protecting the eggs), which seems really stupid for a tournament where no one was supposed to die. And not only that, but when Harry fights his dragon, it wasn't a few scenes of him flying around the nesting mother who wouldn't leave her eggs; it was a long drawn out scene where the dragon escapes, Harry flies out of the stadium all together and gets chased around Hogwarts, dangles off the side of towers, mangles roofs, and of course loses the dragon somewhere around the castle, and for all appearances, it might still be there, because you don't see it return or get captured. In the book, they mention dragon handlers would be standing by in the event ""things got out of hand."" I think the dragon escaping and chasing a fourteen year old kid around in an attempt to kill him is ""out of hand,"" but no one, not the professors, not the dragon handlers, not even Hagrid, did anything. They just sat there.

This is just one tiny plot hole, though, next to what was left out at the end. Barty Crouch of the Ministry, a poorly developed character to begin with, died seemingly without cause, just being found dead and nothing more being said about that. Barty Crouch Jr., who was posing as Mad-Eye Moody throughout the film, was left without an ending. Was he taken to Azkaban, did Fudge have his soul sucked out by a dementor like in the book, did he get away? The scene just jumps to a very tired Dumbledore giving a half-hearted speech to students about Cedric's death. Also left out is the fact that Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge was now opposed to Dumbledore and his crusade to tell people about Voldemort's return, and was mentioned only in passing, when Dumbledore says, ""The Minster of Magic doesn't want me to tell you this..."" Why? Well, maybe you just are expected to have read the book.

Another problem, although this might just be me, was Voldemort. No offense to Ralph Fiennes, I know he's a good actor, but his scenes all seem so rushed he's practically treading over all his lines to cram them into the tiny space allotted for them. And I don't know about anyone else, but when you first see the darkest wizard to grace the wizarding world, you're first thought should not be, ""I thought he'd be taller.""

Over all, though, the film does has its moments. But it's best if you don't do what I did, which was reread the book right before watching it. It does stay pretty close to the story, the characters are all well cast, and except for Dumbledore, are good portrayals of the characters. The one major flaw is the fact that there needs to be more Fred and George. These two on their own would make the film worth watching.",1187136000,,5717,4.610019646365423

2505190,3,B000E6EK3S,"I just finished reading the Goblet of Fire and I went immediately to the video store to see if the DVD held up to the book.  The book was amazing, out of this world and the best Harry Potter I've read so far.  THE BOOK DESERVES FIVE STARS.  However, the cinematic adaptation left me amazed by the special effects, but also deeply disappointed.  I KNOW that it's impossible to adapt 730 pages into a 2 hour movie.  I'm not asking for the moon, but I think the director left out some really important details that really let me down.

*There were no house elves in the movie!  Dobby gave Harry the gillweed, NOT Neville.
*The first task with the dragons just wasn't real at all.  In the book Harry concentrates on learning the summon spell to attract his broom and that's his main strategy.  In the movie it looks like it occurred to him at the last moment and then that chase over Hogwarts just didn't happen in the book.
*The third task, the labyrinth was clearly the weakest part of the movie!  What a downer!  We didn't really see any obstacles... Where was the Boggart (in Dementor form), the Blast-Ended Skrewt and how about the Sphinx to get by and then the spider at the end?...  Cedric and Harry fought the spider together and Harry stunned Victor, NOT Cedric.  The whole scene was wrong and thoroughly disappointed me.  It was as if Harry just ran through the maze and the maze kept on opening and closing new paths...  What an obstacle! (Sarcasm)  And Harry didn't use his ""compass"" spell.
*Finally, the battle scene with Voldemort was cool, but after he breaks the wand connection, Harry had to struggle his way back to the cup (to return to Hogwarts)...  He fights his way back casting off spells and dodging incoming attacks.  In the movie he just jumps to the cup, summons it and zooms out of there.  NO SUSPENSE!  It was supposed to be highly difficult to escape.

I know this is a harsh and picky review, but I expected and got a heck of a lot from the book and the movie just could not attain that high level for me!  The movie is still worth seeing but with a lot of grains of salt.  I hope to God they release a special edition with an improved ending... especially the maze.  If I could re-do one scene, it would be the maze.",1187049600,,2244,4.37772397094431

2505193,3,B000E6EK3S,"I loved the book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, and thought it was one of the best in the series. The movie adaptation ,though decent enough on its own, takes far too many liberties with the book, leaving out many crucial plot points.

The story in a nutshell - Harry and his friends Ron & Hermione enter their fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and find the school playing host to students from Beaubaxton & Durmstrang schools of magic. The main event of the year is the Triwizard Tournament, where one champion from each school will be selected to participate. Of course, Harry finds himself [without entering his name] being selected to participate as well, and together with the other three selected champions [Cedric Diggory from Hogwarts, Fleur de la Couer from Beaubaxton, and Viktor Krum from Durmstrang] embarks on fulfilling the three tasks set for them, encountering intrigue, danger, and also the very possible rise of a menacing evil in the form of Harry's arch nemesis, Lord Voldemort.

As for leaving out crucial plot points, the movie does not develop the strengthening bonds developing between Harry and his godfather Sirius Black, which is very much evident and well-developed in the book. The moviemakers also took a lot of liberties in changing some events to suit the movie, even changing the characters at times [in the book it is Dobby the house elf that helps Harry with the second task, not Neville Longbottom as portrayed in the movie]. There are other quibbles that I shall not enumerate here, for the sake of brevity.

That being said, the movie itself is quite fun to watch, I liked the way the Beaubaxtons, and Durmstrangs made their entrance. Also, the underwater scene for Harry's second task in the Triwizard Tournament is superbly done. The actors playing Harry[Dan Radcliffe], Ron {Rupert Grint]& Hermione [Emma Watson] have truly matured in their roles here, and their performances make for compelling viewing. Hermione has blossomed into a beautiful young lady, and the boys too seem to be taking notice of the opposite sex [[both develop crushes], all very natural given that they are now young adolescents. The Yule Ball is depicted beautifully on-screen. The actor playing Mad Eye Moody [the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher] is quite a treat to watch, with his weird goggling eye, and mannerisms.

The CGI effects are impressive as with the other Potter films -there are dragons, grindylows [water demons] etc to entertain viewers. Overall, though this is a fun movie, I still prefer the previous three in the Harry Potter franchise, mostly because the first three tried their best to stay faithful to the books, and this one took too many liberties[though I admit at over 700 pages long, it is a bit hard to include every single important detail]. Nevertheless, I would recommend adding it to your collection if you're a fan of the series.",1186272000,,2920,4.928861788617886

The story in the book is much more complicated and interesting than in the movie. It's as if they took an orange, scooped out all the pulp, poured in water, high fructose corn syrup and artificial orange flavour and said, here you go, here's an orange.
They made too many cuts to the story that didn't add to the plot and added things that weren't in the book that did nothing to move the story along.
Too many unnessasary changes just makes for a messy movie which is confusing to all who haven't read the book.

The movie is complex and shows both the trial of adolesence and Harry's own particular trials with the Dark Lord. It follows that book without just duplicating the book in whole.

You get to really see Harry as someone you might know. Hermoine and Ron  could be people in your high school. The action works right along with the film--not jumping to far in front of character development. Excellent job.

And to all who says it left so much from the book out, I say read other books and then watch the movies you love. Michael Puzo's Godfather is different than the movie, the Color Purple, The Rising Sun (the main character is blond with blue eyes in the movie the man is played by Wesley Snipes).

Steve Kloves is one of the best screenwriters to this date and he had the difficult job of turning a fun, exciting-but-sprawling story into a cohesive development; 5/5.

Emma Watson is an absolute visual treasure, and watching Hermione blossom into a beautiful young woman is breathtaking; 5/5.

2505204,4,B000E6EK3S,"The Harry Potter franchise has been all over the place, in large part due to playing ""musical directors."" The first two are decent children's movies, faithful if unimaginative retellings of the books with sub-par acting that children will still enjoy and that adults can use as CliffsNotes when they don't have time to read the always-superior source material. The third is my least favorite. Although the director gave the series a needed redirect and dose of maturity, creating an artsy and moody setting that was magical in and of itself, he used a machete rather than pruning scissors and left an emotially devoid story in his wake. And the creature effects were the cheesiest I've ever seen in a big-budget film (could they not at least have used a real dog for Sirius, as they did in #5?).

In Goblet, the director struck the right balance. He omitted and altered with purpose (to compress storylines and limit the number of characters, not to change for the sake of change). Neville is flushed out, which prepares him well for Order. The look is beautiful, and he wisely limits his budget to one well-crafted creature (the dragon, in an expanded role). And most important of all, he balances the excitement of the tournament with the emotional development of the characters, who have finally polished their acting skills. Much of the ""whodunit"" is lost with the early introduction of Barty Crouch, but on the whole the movie aptly retained the book's strong character development, sense of suspense, and tragic and foreboding ending. My main complaint is that the talk with Dumbledore is shortened to a couple lines. The Dumbledore-Harry dynamic needed more emphasis to highten the impact of things to come.

Goblet is the first HP movie I added to my library. Order is also very promising (I've only seen it once, so I won't yet comment). I hope this trend continues in the final two.",1184457600,,1892,4.854489164086687

But what should have been a fun trip turns serious when the campground is destroyed and a giant skull shows above the area.  The skull is the sign of the evil Voldemort.

I first saw this movie in the theater and loved it.  I have since started reading the books and expected it to change my take on this movie.  After all, the movie takes a 740 page book and turns it into a two and a half hour movie.  You know they will be leaving stuff out.

Actually, however, the movie works.  Yep, there were lots of things left out of the book, but they did a good job of covering the important plot points without losing those who haven't read the book.  That's impressive.

Ironically, they did add some things for the movie.  The most noticeable is the first task.  While dangerous in the book, they made it much worse here.  That time could have been used for something else, but it does make for a dramatic scene.

The only weak part is the ending.  It is so rushed that it doesn't make the emotional impact that it does in the book.  And it glosses over some of the things that made the ending of the book such a big cliffhanger.

2505223,3,B000E6EK3S,"First off, I thought this movie was quite entertaining and exciting in a thrill-ride sort of way, but it was the weakest film in the Harry Potter series. Many people will disagree with me, but this film lacked in plot and character development. The Triwizard champions had a total of two or less lines in the movie, and they weren't shown enough to grow accustomed to them. Mike Newell might be a great director, but he didn't capture the mood and essence of the Harry Potter world. Every time I was getting ready to settle with a situation or conflict, the movie took me to an entirely different ball park. The film never settled... it was in a constant rush.
Before the movie premiered in theaters, I remember hearing Newell say in an interview that he took out a few unnecessary subplots. He definitely took out many unnecessary subplots, and he replaced them with some other unnecessary scenes. There was a part in the movie where ""Karkaroff"" (The Durmstrang Headmaster)is shown secretly entering the lonely Great Hall. It's a very suspicious scene that leaves the audience wondering: What happens?... Nothing... nothing happens. That scene was just placed there for the sake of adding suspense to the story. The Beauxbatons champion, Fleur Delacour, was a very intriguing character in the book, and I was very disappointed when her total screen time added up to about three minutes. I had no complaints about her look, because I think she was as beautiful as they described her in the book, yet the director didn't take advantage of her screen time. In fact, the director didn't take advantage of any actor's screen time. Rita Skeeter, the haughty reporter for the Daily Prophet (played by the talented Miranda Richardson), was a very random character in the film, but in the book, she was a very well-developed character.
I'm sorry to say, but I think this movie would've been better off in the hands of another director. I think Alfonso Cuaron and Chris Columbus captured the true spirit of J.K. Rowling's magical wizarding world. Chris Columbus portrayed the world as colorful, yet filled with hidden dangers; Cuaron made the third film dark and more adult, still maintaining a magical tone; Mike Newell... he created a tone that was all over the place.
I am no director, but I can say that Mike Newell definitely needs to work on character development in his films. I heard he made the film ""Mona Lisa Smile"", and when I saw that movie, I had the same complaints I had for Harry Potter 4: ""It just could've been better"". Mona Lisa Smile lacked in proper character development as well. I know we live in a society that demands instant action and conflict in its flicks, but there are ways of doing that without rushing plot or character development. I'm just glad he's not doing the next Harry Potter film.
Although I have some complaints about this film, I still have to say that I enjoy watching it because it is entertaining and it is a thrill ride; so I do recommend it for that purpose. Thank You for reading. =)",1181952000,,3025,4.720226843100189

2505225,3,B000E6EK3S,"Before I begin let me say that I just recently discovered how amazing the Harry Potter series is. Although I had seen the first 2 movies I never thought of reading the books until recently. That being said let me add that I thought the first two movies were very good representations of the

books and the characters that are used in the movies are true to what Rowlings was trying to portray in her books. Now I turn my attention to a heavy weight of a book in Goblet of Fire. Amazing book and I was looking forward to finishing this and then seeing how the movie did this one justice, was I disappointed.

I am terribly sorry but I am NOT going to defend this movie and cry like many of the other people who reviewed this movie. ""The book is over 700 pages"", ""there is so much detail"" blah, blah blah. Well if it is that difficult then DON'T INSULT ME BY MAKING THIS MOVIE AT ALL. If I am interested in the story and the movie is an accurate portrail, I don't mind sitting through 3 to 3.5 hours to get the story right. That concept worked for the Lord of the Rings, why couldn't it work in this case as well?

The best part of the book was the shroud of mystery surrounding the person who was Lord Voldemorts other faithful follower. The movie decided to destroy that right at the beginning by showing a 3rd person in the house with Wormtail and Voldemort. Then lets just skip Bertha Jorkins, without whom Voldemort would have never of known about the world cup and Triwizard Tournament. The book did an excellent job at putting doubts in the readers mind about number of characters 2 of which, Ludo Bagman and Winky the house-elf never made the movie. At no point in the movie did the viewer get the real story on Barty Crouch. A power hungry anti-dark wizard with a private life filled with personal tragedy. The Pensieve trials in the movie were terrible. They completely hacked and changed the story, making Crouches knowledge of his son a shock at the trial in the movie. What about him being in prison and supposedly dying in Azkaban?

This knowledge gave the reader a sense that the son could never have been part of the plot at Hogwarts to harm Harry Potter. The movie instead, shows the son at the trial, the same face you see at the beginning of the movie so it is easy to deduce that he is connected to the plot against Harry. In the book the son's trial was surronded by the story of Neville's parents and the use of the Cruciatus curse. The movie went as far as to show Neville's complete demoralizing nature after Moody used the curse in class but then the movie let the story dangle and fade away.

The explaination about why two wands bonded during the battle was weak as well. I do agree with another reviewer that the story of Rita Skeeter was weak and not even needed. In the book the story was to show her as a pushy, emblesher and person just trying to get a ""Juicy"" story even if it ruined other peoples lives. Why not go the extra distance and show how she got her stories and Hermiones vendetta and capture of Rita in the end. If they weren't going to do that why not just replace that story altogther with the house-elf story and S.P.E.W.

Finally there are some good points. The Goblet scenes and actual Triwizard Tournament was done well. I thought the first two tasks were done very well. The 3rd stage however was pretty lame, as if it just got in the way of the confrontation between Harry and the resurrected lord himself. No creatures, no riddle just a waste.

So there are my 2 brass knuts worth, the book deserved much better than this. I am very disappointed here and even more disappointed in the people who read this book but gave this movie 5 stars. To them and this movie I say Riddikulus!!",1181520000,,3732,4.353448275862069

2505241,1,B000E6EK3S,"And if I measure the choices made by the director, screenwriter, actors and casting director I find their efforts to be lacking. The book itself is wonderful in many respects, packed with information, back stories and texture that makes for a very enjoyable read. Now I know it's not easy to condense a 700+ page book into a working movie, but c'mon! This is a poor job and not just because of the large amount of material they left out from the book. For example: no Ludo Bagman, no Winky, no Dobby, no S.P.E.W., no Dursleys, no Bertha Jorkins without whom Voldemort wouldn't have known about Barty Crouch Jr's escape from Azkaban, no Quidditch World Cup (we see is the teams fly into the stadium and the next thing everybody is celebrating Ireland's victory), no Rita Skeeter being an animangus, no gobblins, no betting, no Platform 9 3/4, no Barty Crouch Jr. receiving the dementor's kiss, and no final scene with Cornelius Fudge where he denies Voldemort's return. Instead we are treated to extra long and superfluous dragon fight/flight sequence a long and boring grindylow battle scene during the Triwizard Tournament's second task, not to mention the maze being completely different from the book: no sphinx, no acromantula. It is certainly possible to make edits and a coherent movie. Unfortunately so many details are left out, awkwardly edited or portrayed that if you haven't read the book you might not know what is going on. And if you had read the book you're not going to like the changes, at least I didn't. For example I didn't like all the Beauxbatons students being all-female, nor the Durmstrang students being all male, and don't get me started on the fake CGI looking merpeople, yuck.

Missing details and editing are not the least of the problems. There's also direction, acting and casting misteps gallore. The casting choices for the new characters are atrocious. Krum looks nothing like he is described in the book, nor does he behave like the Krum of Rowlings novel. His role in the movie too is sadly reduced. Madame Maxine was supposed to be an olive skinned, handsome women with a prominent Gaulic nose. What we get is a scarecrow with a bad French accent. Fleur Delacroix is supposed to be beautiful, part veela with white blond hair, magically delicious! In the movie she's rather plain looking with light brown hair. None of her haughtiness is portrayed and might as well not have been there for all the impact she made. Karkaroff had white hair, wasn't scruffy but rather well groomed, crafty or shifty rather than brutal. Barty Crouch Jr. was supposed to be blond and somewhat good looking, not some goggle eyed, sweaty, tongue flicking loony. In fact it was his ""normal"" appearance that made his slavish devotion to Voldemort so much more disturbing. He wasn't a stock character bad guy. Shame on the director and shame on the actor for making him a sweaty nutjob. But the worst is Dumbledore. Richard Harris effectively portrayed the sensitivity, gravitas, intelligence and power written into the character by J. K. Rowling. The new Dumbledore is a grouchy, somewhat thick-headed man who projects all the presence and majesty of a minor bureaucrat with a bad attitude. After Harry's name comes up from the Goblet Of Fire making him the fourth Triwizard champion, he screams Harry's name. Then later grabs Harry by the shoulders, shoves him and yells in Harry's face ""Did you get an older student to put your name in the Goblet for you!?!?!"" This is NOT the way Rowlings beloved Dumbledore would act, sorry. How'd this guy get the job? I can't really fault Daniel Radcliffe or Rupert Grint too much, they were servicable if not remarkable in their roles. Emma Watson as Hermione however is scenery chewingly off character. She's either on the brink of tears, crying or on the brink of angry tears. Her performance is way over-the-top, falsely dramatic and untrue to the character. ACTING!!! with a capital A.

The tone and tenor of Rowlings book is simply missing from this movie. The characters bear little resemblence to those in her book and not least because they run around in Muggle clothes for half the movie. Because of editing choices the movie has an awkward flow and might not be comprehensible to someone not familiar with the book. Now I know I've been emphasizing differences between the book and movie and to some people I'm being a nit picker. Well I could forgive radical changes if the movie wasn't so and here's that word again: awkward. The story simply doesn't flow well, the rhythm feels rushed, the emphasis is on action rather than plot. I got bored about half way through. In fact it took me two viewings to get through it.

2505244,3,B000E6EK3S,"I won't write a synopsis, I'm sure there will be hundreds of people who will after this review.

My family and I all love the Harry potter stories. They are rich and enjoyable. I find myself anticipating the release of Deathly Hallows. But the movies, I'm sad to say, have recently been lacking, and that continues with this one. It seemed to begin with Prisoner of Azkaban. After watching the interviews, and discovering how Cuaron cheated by having the kids write essays on their characters instead of reading the book, I was very disappointed and the butchery of the story for the sake of time and 'Hollywood' THEN made sense. They seem to be leaving things out, important things to the story. What happened to SPEW? What happened to Hermione knitting hats? These things may not have seemed important to the over all story as portrayed in the movie, but these little touches add depth and colour to the world of Harry Potter. they could have shortened the battle with the dragon in Goblet, perhaps put in a couple of two or three minute spots about SPEW, but they chose to go for the action instead of the human touches to these stories. My daughter plans to take me to see Order of The Phoenix for my birthday. And I'm sad to say, I'm only partially looking forward to it at this point, I keep hoping that they will pull it back together.

What makes this movie worth while?  Not much. The acting is still topnotch from a lot of the actors, but it seems more like they're reading from cue boards than acting anymore.

It seemed that the movie tried to satisfy the fans by adding all the favorite scenes (the ferret!) but they failed.  The scenes make little to no sense without the rest of the plot.  They also tried to please someone with the hugely overdone dragon scene.  It was idiotic.  Where was the need for it?  Couldn't they have just shortened that scene and a few other similarly overdone scenes, and instead, added a few transitions to make this movie run more smoothly?

2505248,4,B000E6EK3S,"Cuaron destroyed the movie Prisoner of Azkaban to the point that it held little if any real resemblance to the book from which it was adapted. Goblet of Fire, in the hands of a REAL director, luckily returns to many of the things that make the series so grand. You have plenty of substance. You have storyline and plot that really moved this series along about as well as the book does. The problem with part four is that it DOESN'T really serve much purpose in the series. It merely foreshadows what will come.... and serves to show that Voldemort is evil. We already KNEW That!

But as movies go, it's a great adaptation. The only problem I had with it was a similar problem I had with part three.... Too much cutting of important information. The usual Potter MOVIE fan is going to be confused as to how Harry makes it to Hogsmeade village in future parts without knowing that, at the end of book 3, a certain character signs his permission slip, thereby granting him said permission. This is just one of the glaring deletions that are going to make the movies really hard to follow...

I also missed Dobby and S.P.E.W.

I understand why they were deleted, but so much more could have been done.

2505250,4,B000E6EK3S,"I can now write a fully un-biased opinion of the movie, having just completed reading HP -Goblet of Fire.

Having read the wonderful works of JK Rowling I will say that I enjoyed the book more then the moive. Having said that however, i fully loved the movie.

The directors of HP 4 did very well with Rowling's material, they were faced with a very daunting task, to condense a 738 page book into a three hour movie and meet the approval of it's acclaimed creator.

I feel that they performed this task admirably. All of the main plotlines of the story were still there, Harry competing in the Triwizard Tournament, the threat of Lord Voltenmort, and the horrbile end to Cedric Diggory in the graveyard. Though I did find the presentation of Draco Malfoy to be somewhat lax in the movie. In the book Malfoy is much more malicous, especially towards Hermonie. In the movie he is potrayed more as the childish villian comic relief. I wished the director would have have used Draco's character to it's full extent, he is a rival that deserves his spotlight to show how Harry shines against him.

Though I very throughly loved the relationship between Harry and Hermonie. While some will argue that Hermonie's time spent with Harry in the movie overshadowed the underlying feelings Ron shared for her in the book I feel that the movie potrayed all aspects of the relationships well.

Hermonie's closeness to Harry in the movie is taken directly from the book. Ron and Harry were in a feud throughout half of the story, and Hermonie alone helped Harry through the first part of the Triwizard Tournament. It wasn't as if it was just added to fuel a teenage romance for box office sales. Plus all of Ron's snipness towards Hermonie for being involved with Viktor Krum are still in place. Though Hermonie's reaction after the Yule Ball in the movie was a bit overdone.

I DO however do not get the remarks about Hermonie being made too pretty in the movie. Emma Watson potrays Hermonie beautifully; she can't help it if she's pretty and switching her with an actor who more ""resembles"" hermonie in the book would compromise asthetics for damn good character potrayal (I've seen the movies first so in my mind Emma Watson IS Hermonie)

A fav scene the movie was the scene with Lord Voltemort, which was stunningly terrifying to watch, gorry, and very real to the telling in the book. Though I did fully miss the scenes from the book immediatly after the climatic struggle where Harry is taken to the hosptail wing and bombarded upon by the frantic worry of the Weasley's, Sirus and Hermonie. The movie would have been too long had it been placed in there, but I found the haunting saddest part of the book to be when Harry is embraced by Mrs. Weasley after desperatly trying not to blame himself for Cedric's death, and I wish it could have been incorporated into the movie.

Even with all it's flaws I feel that the movie perfomed admirably

2505268,4,B000E6EK3S,"The fourth installment of the Harry Potter series is by far the darkest of the movies released so far. ""The Goblet of Fire"" takes the audience through Harry, Ron, and Hermoine's entrance into adolescence, and all the struggles that implies. For Hermoine, that means being pursued by Bulgarian celebrity athlete Viktor Krum. For Ron, it's dealing with jealousy and relationship problems with both Harry and Hermoine. For Harry, it's battling dragons and water creatures, dealing with slanderous gossip, and getting a crush on Cho Chang.

One of the strengths of ""the Goblet of Fire"" is the plot depth. Every film reveals something new about the mystery about Harry Potter and Voldemort; this fourth movie gives away the most answers yet, as well the most intense plot. Unlike the other three movies, the fourth suddenly lets the audience know that dark times have come to Harry, and will only get worse at time goes on. We see characters killed, and not just the villains. On the contrary, the villains get quite a bit accomplished in this installment, which will make for hard battles for Harry in later movies. Dumbledore is starting to appear weak, and Voldemort has just become a lot stronger.

2505285,3,B000E6EK3S,"Note: DO NOT READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE.

This was not the strongest in this series of movies by any means.  There is a completely different feel to this movie that there were to the previous movies in the series.  In fact, the first two are completely different than the last two, focusing more on the magic and Harry's innocence of it all while Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire focus more outside the classroom on the relationahips (though not necessarily the development of the characters).

That being said, this movie had several good points - the special effects were phenomenal (the dragon and merpeople were superb), and it was still teaching Harry things he didn't know about the magic world (portkeys and tents and fires).  The characters are continuing to grow and evolve, and the tension between Ron and Hermione continues.

Now for the bad - they took out a large portion of the story line from the book, so much that if you hadn't read the book, as my family hadn't, you can't follow the movie.  A change of motive, elimination of key characters, and a change of history.  In the 3rd movie, dementors were all over the place when Black escapes, yet in this film, there were no dementors to be found when Crouch Jr. ""escapes"", as Dumbledore reveals at the end of the film.  In the book, his escape is entirely different, so much so that everyone assumes he's dead.

Then there is the death of Crouch Sr.  In the book, he disappears after having a frantic and hurried conversation with Harry.  Here, he is merely dead.  The time in the maze is also altered dramatically, changing Harry from a sympathetic hero to an annoying and competitive one.  In the book, Harry saves Cedric more than once, here it's the other way around until the final one.  Harry is not nearly as heroic.

They downplayed some relationships (such as Hagrid and Madame Maxine), and overplayed others (like Herminone and Viktor).  Hagrid's past is more revealed in the book that it is in the movie, creating a terrible situation for him and opening an opportunity to help Dumbledore in book 5.  That situation was ignored here.  For many people, the on-screen Quiddich games are a big draw (my sister included) and this movie eliminates the only Quiddich in the book - the World Cup at the beginning.  The film also does not end the same way, not setting up the next story line properly for the 5th film.  They either are changing that one so as to make it unreconizable, or have a lot of catching up to do.

Finally, there's Voldemort.  He comes alive at the end of the movie in much the same way that he does in the book (although the spell was abbreviated in the movie).  But is he scary as the all-powerful dark wizard?  Not really.  The battle between Harry and Voldemort is confusing to those who have not ready the book, with Dumbledore figuring it out and not letting anyone else in on the tale.  ""Priori incantadum"" forces the wand to regurgitate its last spells, in this case the hand Voldemort created for Wormtail, death of Cedric, the death of the caretaker, and the death of Harry's parents (in the book, there was another death, but that character was eliminated).  The movie doesn't explain why this happened, it just happened, which leaves open questions in the minds of viewers who have not read the book.

For anyone who hasn't read the book, this movie is confusing and disjointed.  For those who have read the book, the movie is disappointing in that it doesn't follow with the book.  I understand that movies need to be changed to fit in the time allotted, and that books contain far more character development and introspection that a movie can allow.  However, by changing such key elements, and not setting up the next story line, this movie succeeded only in disappointing both sets of viewers who watch it.",1169596800,,3836,4.628698224852071

Unfortunately, as they have lost their cuteness, they have not been able to find any greater acting ability than they had when they were pre-teens.  The movie focuses far too much on relationships and eschews any continuity and depth that was had in the books.

Don't get me wrong, I understand that, as the books get harder, the directors and writers will have to make harder and harder choices about what to exclude and what to keep, but this time the director just chose incorrectly.  The movie might appeal to pre-teens because of the heavy focus on relationships between the characters, but the rest of us will just feel excluded.",1169251200,,711,4.709677419354839

2505335,5,B000E6EK3S,"I spent the equivalent of a full day's waking-hours in front of my big screen TV this past winter break with just the 2 sets of the four Harry Potter movies and the three Lord of the Rings movies. I am NOT a couch potato. I am NOT a couch potato. I am NOT a couch potato.

Well, at least it was time well spent. Finally...some movies that really make the grade. I've been hard-pressed to find a good 5-star movie that I haven't seen. And here I've had these two sets of films that have been out there all this time that that for whatever reason I've had an aversion to. Silly me.

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire were all at minimum very good. Certainly Socerer's Stone, Chamber and Goblet of Fire are as 5-star as it gets. Azkaban was relatively slow compared to the others, but look at the footsteps that it had to follow in.

The list of A-list actors giving A-list performances goes on....You have Richard Harris (GRHS) who was flawlessly and un-noticably (no disrespect intended) replaced by Michael Gambon; Miranda Richardson, Gary Oldman, there's Alan Rickman doing his best Jeremy Irons imitation, Ralph Fiennes, John Hurt, Shirley Henderson, John Cleese and of course Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid. I know I'm forgetting more, but you get the idea.

Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber were brilliantly led by the direction of Veteran Chris Columbus (Home Alone and tons more). And the cast of these films?...How often do three unknowns (Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley) walk into overnight stardom? Not very. But these three sure did. And it's well deserved. Their characters are well acted and believable; not bad for a bunch of preteens in their debuts.

Azkaban was really good and certainly an integral part of the Harry Potter progression of stories. But Azkaban was the first hand-off of the director baton from Columbus to the short resumed, mostly-foreign-film-guy Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n. Columbus still had oversight as a producer, so perhaps Cuar&oacute;n felt intimidated by Columbus' brilliance in Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber...or perhaps Cuar&oacute;n just held back from doing his own thing. Be that as it may, the change in ""direction"" really shone through. And Cuar&oacute;n was gone for Goblet.

Goblet comes in with three changes in direction: 1) The director change from Cuar&oacute;n back to another vet in Mike Newell, 2) The exit of Columbus oversight, and 3) A shift from...shall we say...a more famlyish Harry Potter to a more dark Harry Potter (the way it was intended!). And this did not go un-noticed by the MPAA.

It's must be tough to make a PG movie these days; it's hard to believe that the MPAA took the Potter series from a PG rating to a PG-13 rating for Goblet. Kids 13 and under can see uglier violence and hear more profanity at school recess and at the local playground than they do in Goblet...better start a rating system for playgrounds! How is it that a movie like Goblet without a curse-word or graphic act of violence (by today's standards anyway) gets thrown into the same category as, for example, S.W.A.T. (2003) that does indeed not only have the F-word, but strong violence and sex? Ludicrous. But I won't get started on how unfair the MPAA is and how neurotically insane the pressure is from certain groups on the MPAA to ""protect"" our youth.

I will indeed finish by saying that the first four of the Harry Potter releases combined have grossed close to $2,000,000,000 (that's a TWO BILLION dollars) because they're excellent movies that kids can watch too. And Goblet actually did better at the box office than Azkaban. So stick that in your pipe and smoke it, MPAA.

If you somehow missed these movies as I did for some crazy reason, I hope that my long-winded review has encouraged you to add them to your cart. As for Lord of the Rings...well that's another review entirely, of course.

I can't wait for the upcoming continuation of the Harry Potter series with Order of the Phoenix in 2007 and Half-Blood Prince in 2008. I am NOT a couch potato.",1167782400,,4129,4.786516853932584

In this version in particular, there is a very real sense of danger and that Harry could be in trouble.  The movie also reflects the growth of the three Potter buddies as they take on more mature life issues (eg. dating) when Hogwarts is infused with students from other schools of magic for the school year.  Ralph Feinnes is brilliant as the evil Voltemort and the kids pull off solid performances with more difficult dramatic material and challenges than ever.

2505338,5,B000E6EK3S,"While many viewers who have also read the book might not consider this movie to be quite so good, I adore this movie and consider it the best of the four films. Although I was a bit dissapointed with the lack of Professor Snape in the movie, I was charmed by the cast and found the performances for the most part to be truly believeable and touching.

On the other hand...there are a few things about this movie that bothered me (along with the other viewers who are also fans of the book series by J.K. Rowling.)

1) No Dursleys- This was by far possibly the most dissapointing and infuriating offense that I have with this film. Prehaps the director thought that the movie could start off w/out the memorable escapes that Harry manages whenever he is stuck with the Dursleys in the summer, but I treasure that as one of the highlights of the movie, and I was especially looking forward to this one.

2)Voldemort- I was so dissapointed when the big bad was revealed. While I do believe that Voldemort for the most part is faithfully reproduced in the film, I was hoping that he would be a bit more...menacing, more...evil. The portrayl of Voldemort was good, but...he seemed kind of weak in comparison with the Voldemort described in the book.

3) Amos Diggory- Now the character overall was great. The only thing that I thought was a bit dumb was the scene where Amos is grieving when he learns that his  son has been murdered. It didn't resonate with me. Also, I was so dissapointed by the way Harry was carrying on. It just seemed fake to me. I liked it but...

4) No Set-Up - THis was by far the 2nd most dissapointing part of the movie for me. In no way shape or form did they movie set up events for the 5th movie/book, ""The Order of the Pheonix"". There was a part in the book where Dumbledore begins planning for the assembly of the ""old crowd"", a quote that was absent in the film. Also, the ending didn't mesh with me at all. Good, but something that might have been more appropriate in the 3rd or the 2nd movie. Not this one.

So, while this film wasn't perfect, I do consider it the best of the four, and it is one that everyone should add to their collection. Five stars for sure.",1167350400,,2193,4.360294117647059

2505341,5,B000E6EK3S,"While Prisoner of Azkaban was the most daring of the films, this one is the best. As Rowling's books progress she is allowing them to grow in their depth and complexity. Goblet captures these themes (trials and tribulations of adolescence, jealousy, sexual awaking, inherent potential for evil in bureaucratic systems, duality of human nature and the good and evil we are all capable of). What started as a simple fantasy story is emerging into a sophisticated analysis of the human condition. Magic has become a metaphor for Rowling to convey these rich themes.  All of these issues just are starting to develop in Goblet, but they come into fruition in Order of the Phoenix. The hints though are all appropriately placed by Newell.

The acting is excellent, I enjoyed Michael Gambon's Dumbledore, it took a film to step into the big shoes of Richard Harris but he has finally done so and made Dumbledore his own. Ralph Fiennes makes a frightening Voldemort. The fellow Hogwart's students are slowly becoming real characters with their own potential arcs and not merely window dressing. I hope this trend continues.

The DVD package is complete with documentaries, deleted scenes and children's games, this is a package the entire family can enjoy.

Hearing the director call HP: The Goblet of Fire ""a thriller"" explained a lot of his choices to me. (All of them...bad.) The movie kept things that moved the frenzied action and effects quickly along, but omitted things that revealed many important factors of the characters and plot.

Again, this failure rests with a director who does not understand how clever fantasy and adventure--with characters you actually believe in and care about--can add up to GENUINE suspense and entertainment.

Goblet fails on so many important levels of performance (Dumbledore and Hermione) and story. Too bad, because the budget is clearly a generous one. But, again, special effects can not save a badly written script, badly told.",1165276800,,987,5.0060975609756095

I have enjoyed movie 1 to 3 but have been shunting this movie because of many critical reviews here. People complained everything from omitting riddle in the maze scene, spending too much time on the dragon, to Hermione being too pretty. However, after finally watching the DVD myself I am compelled to applaud the creativity of transforming an 800 pages book into an exciting 2 hour movie, with spectacular visual effects, suspense and superb acting. I felt that events in the book were allocated just the right amount of time. Including the riddle scene in the maze would be certainly a bad idea since it would have spoiled the suspense that has been building up. For people who read the book before watching the movie one of the enjoyment comes from the difference between one's own visualization while reading and that of the movie.

2505346,4,B000E6EK3S,"I am a big fan of Harry Potter movies, and have seen each one at the theaters.  Having NOT read any of the books except the first, I am probably in that minority of fans who can critique this movie as a stand-alone without any compare or contrast with the book.  I watched this movie a week after it came out and was highly impressed with it, and considered it the best movie of the four so far released.  I then watched it on DVD at home, and a 2nd viewing has clarified many plot lines first unnoticed, but has revealed numerous flaws which actually make the movie somewhat nonsensical.

Lets cover both the pluses and flaws of this movie simultaneously.  First of, all the Potter movies have tried to portray the students as true kids; some fat, some skinny, some nerdy, some gawkish (Ron), some bullish (Malfoy), some prudish (Hermione), etc... from a diverse group of races, nationalities, and socio-economic backgrounds.  So the emotional, physical and social makeup of Hogwarts realistically mirrors many schools.  This is probably why these books and the ensuing movies have done so well; children around the world can relate to the characters.  Yet one flaw, or lack of flaws, is quite visible: no acne.  The school is filled with kids ranging from 10 - 18, and not a single one has any sort of acne, pimples, or any other skin blemishes common to kids of these ages.  This is incredible, and could probably be attributed to some magic potions added to their food or water, though this is never mentioned in the movies.

Second, the music.  This movie differs the most from the other movies in terms of music.  The main Potter theme at the opening credits is still there, but from then on all the music is new; whereas the first three movies rehashed multiple themes.  This is good in many ways, and refreshing to see and listen.

Third is the magic.  Each movie has several distinctive magical objects that make you go ""WOW, I wish I had that"".  In the 3rd movie, it was the pendulum Hermione uses to travel into the past.  Here, it must be Portkey, and for once, we see one magical object used twice in a movie.  In this case, the movie begins and ends with two different Portkeys.  Each movie also has the scenes that amaze and awe the audience in their inventiveness and wow factor.  In this one, Harry tells us the audience which scene it is, the one where he proclaims his love for magic after stepping inside a small tent that houses a huge home.

Fourth is the cinematography.  Each movie so far features the flying skills of Harry, and these are often where the cinematography and special effects are at their best.  Now, instead of Harry chasing an object in Quidditch, he is chased by a fire-breathing dragon, thereby raising the suspense level.

Fifth is the action scenes, and here is where this movie is lacking.  The action scenes are quite amazing, but somewhat nonsensical overall.  Several examples will illustrate this.  First, why in the maze do all the contestants just try and walk thru it.  Between them, they could have done a lot better than stumbling here and there.  Why not use their magic to levitate above the bush walls, or just burn the whole thing down wall by wall?  If Krum could turn himself into a shark to swim thru the lake and rescue Hermione, he surely could have turned himself into a huge giraffe and just strided over the entire maze.  Second, why in the scene with the dragon does Harry just walk straight into the arena.  He saw the dragon the night before and surely should have been more cautious.  Any boy wondering into a junkyard is smart enough to keep along a wall and lookout for the dogs.  Yet Harry strolls right for the egg without bothering to scout around first and determine the dragon's whereabouts.  Third and most noticeably, all three tasks made the French contestant look like a big wimp.  The director must have something against the French.

Last is the dialogue.  Several miscues here.  One small but clear one is when Dumbeldorff introduces the Bulgarian team as our friends from the North.  Last time I checked, Bulgaria is farther south than the UK.  More noticeable is the plainness of the dialogue.  Nothing solemn or eloquent like in the 3rd movie when Lupus reminesces with Harry about his parents.  Even the threats of Snape are quite short and mostly harmless.  Minerva barely has a word.  Even the scene when Dumbeldorff reads Harry's name for the contest seems shorted.  I was expecting Harry to scream out a ""I didn't do it"" or ""There's got to be a mistake"".  Instead he grimaces like he is constipated.

I noticed that Harry, more than any other character, is a reactionary.  His dialogue is always a reaction to the words or actions of someone else.  Rarely does he initiate a thought provoking conversation by himself like ""Hey Ron, when did you realize you had magical powers?""  In previous movies this flaw was overshadowed by the dialogue of others, but here it shows thru silent and clear.

This is a good movie never the less, and maybe one of the best of 2005 in terms of entertainment value.  The storlyline is solid, the acting is crisp and the special effects are spot on.  But other parts like the dialogue and magic were only good; not great.  The Widescreen Edition which I have has no special features whatsoever, so do not pay any more than $5 for it at a Christmas sale or something.  If you want to buy the movie, get the Collectors Edition set.",1164672000,,5453,4.604361370716511
2505347,3,B000E6EK3S,"For the first time ever, I was NOT entertained by a Harry Potter movie.  Something was seriously wrong with the entire thing.  I remember the happy look on my face when I found out that HBO would be airing Goblet of Fire in late November.  I waited patiently for the new Harry Potter film like a snake in the grass.  Just the magical atmosphere of the previous three Potter movies made me want to crave another one, and crave it BADLY.  Turns out I was surprisingly disappointed with it.

I hated that the first 45 minutes really didn't do much in the way of keeping my interest.  I thought that whole portion of the film was pointless.  It was like they were trying to recapture the mysterious atmosphere from Chamber of Secrets, but not so interesting the second time because we've already seen it before, and done MUCH better then.

Another crappy part of the plotline- Harry Potter goes to dancing class with his friends.  I'm not kidding.  Why would anyone find this interesting?  It was a waste of time.  To make matters worse, a fairly lengthy amount of time was devoted to it.  Just silly.

Look, I LOVED the previous three Harry Potter movies, but this one just didn't do anything for me.  It was like the writers have finally run out of ideas, and the feeling I got was that the only reason this movie exists is to either make more money, or, probably more realistically, the writers wanted to give hardcore Potter fans more storyline and top-notch production to cheer about.  Hey, I can't blame them for that.

Harry Potter fans love the books and the movies.  We know this from experience by the way people stand outside at midnight waiting for either the new book to be released or the new movie to be shown. So if the fans are happy with this film, good for them.  I sure wasn't.  To me, Goblet of Fire had a ""been there, done that"" vibe, and I simply can't look at it any other way, unfortunately.

To sum up this disappointing film- a few interesting action scenes (one exciting memorable scene in particular was Harry challenging a giant flying bird thing- sorry, I don't know what you're supposed to call the darn creature) in between a LOT of unnecessary dialogue that apparently is only interesting if you happen to be a REALLY big Harry Potter fan.  For the people out there reading who just *enjoy* the Potter films but aren't obsessed- stick with the previous three.

(updated thoughts- January 2, 2007)-

Okay, watching the movie a second time (which seems to be necessary, I apologize) I actually really like the movie after all.  I give it a rating of 4 out of 5.  The segments I originally thought dragged, were actually pretty good.  They WERE telling a good story here after all, it just wasn't obvious I guess.  The action scenes were pretty spectacular as well.  Harry Potter is just getting older and becoming an adult, that's probably why I hated it at first.  I didn't really care for the whole dancing plot in the middle of the movie (which was about 15 boring minutes long) but that's the only serious complaint.",1164412800,,3048,4.558011049723757
2505348,1,B000E6EK3S,I too purchased the Target $3.98 copyand found it to be missing so much of the orginal movie that I am returning it.

Shame on Target for passing this off as the movie without notifying customers of the cut verion.,1164326400,,289,4.142857142857143
2505349,4,B000E6EK3S,Finally they made a PG-13 Harry Potter movie. I wonder if the 7th Harry Potter is rated R. No it's Harry Potter come on.,1164326400,,120,4.041666666666667
2505350,3,B000E6EK3S,"WARNING- SOME SPOILERS:

I have to admit that overall the film was enjoyable but many, like me, have read the novels and missed some of the key characters in the tale. Why screenwriter Steve Kloves chose to insert Barty Crouch Jr. into the first scene is beyond me. Next, at the Quidditch World Cup, the set up for the rest of the story is lost. The director and screenwriter show you who sets off the dark mark. Instead of following the story as JK Rowling wrote it in the book- with a house elf being the suspected culprit, even a person who watched the movie with me and didn't read the book guessed that Crouch Jr. would be the ultimate culprit in the end. It sucked the mystery out of this tale.

I am really disappointed in Kloves (perhaps that is why he didn't get the nod for the script writing for movie 5) and this director. Aside from the house elf story line being removed, they completely left out what could have been the funniest scene in the movie- the Weasleys meeting up with the Dursleys. Next Rita Skeeter made an appearance but then disappeared as well. By not following up on her role in this film her actions in movie 5 will be inexplicable.

As much as they want these to be stand alone films they are not- each one weaves into the next and the people that make these should really understand that the majority of people that see the movies have also read the books.

I know time is a constraint but there were loads of wasted moments on film. The Yule ball and the use of a band was a waste of film- the romance between Harry and Cho and Hermione and Krum was all but ignored after the ball so the whole scene was stupid. If I had directed it I would have cut the whole Yule ball thread out.

Perhaps they would have had time to give the ending the proper treatment it deserved- the film fails to do what the book does- set up the dynamics for movie 5. Both this film and the 3rd film ended completely differently from the novels. One may argue that it doesn't matter but I think it does. Viewers of the next movie (assuming they have not read the books) will not understand why Fudge and Dumbledore are at odds among other things.

Overall this is a pleasing movie as a stand alone piece but when it fits into the whole it fails to pass the muster. Unlike the first two films, the last two fail to set up the next and there was a lot of wasted film time...things like the Yule ball, the odd entrance by Krum and company and a few others scenes that were fillers and not really central to the overall plot could have been removed or shortened so that at least the beginning and the ending would have been presented in its proper form.

Yes, it is hard to get all of book 4 into a 157 minute movie- but these people should realize that the endings are especially important in the Potter series. Why the chose to present scenes with no further explination is beyod me...here is an example:

For instance we see that Harry discovers Barty Crouch Sr. apparently dead in the woods but we are never told why he was dead- heart attack- murdered? Who knows...that explination is at the end when the culprit is being questioned.

We have no idea what happened to Crouch Jr- did he go back to prison? But wait- in the next movie Fudge will be denying the return of Voldemort...if Crouch went to prison couldn't truth serum be administered and he could verify everything to Fudge? But as movie 5 viewers will se there is no witness to what happened except Harry (people who read the book know what I am talking about).

So really I think the directors and Kloves, could have done a better job at scene selection and left out too many important scenes in lieu of nonesense. The scenes they did include, that involved minor characters like Krum and Rita Skeeter were not followed up on.., if they hadn't planned on doing that then why bother.

I gave this 3 stars- not because of the production value or the overall storyline but because of the shotty job that was done by the director and the screen writer.

By all means get this DVD if you have not seen it already- it is a good stand alone piece but it does fail to link the puzzle pieces together the way JK Rowling intended them to be in the books.",1163548800,,4216,4.316055625790139

We've seen a lot of Quidditch over the course of the earlier movies. They did add some neat new effects with the magical fireworks and the card show supporting the Bulgarian team. Played nicely against teenage love was Hagrid's infatuation with the giant headmistress of Beauxbatons--a head taller than Hagrid, if that's possible. I think that Emma Watson will have the best career of the young stars of the cast--she's growing up to be a beautiful young woman--both my daughter and I thought her ball dress was stunning. Ron and Harry will have to fight not to be stereotyped after seven HP movies, if they go that far. One thought I had about Ms. Rowling's message was that it might be about the hell we put our young children through in the name of ""healthy"" competition.

When it was over, I felt like 15 or so minutes were missing from the movie.  Anybody who follows the Harry Potter series knows there is another movie to come until we reach number 7, but this one was too open-ended.  The others had closure of some kind.

The relationship between Ron and Hermoine was almost bitter at the end and somewhat unexplained, the comment about ""things will really change next year"" was not really explained, the return of Voldemort and how that was left was just odd.

Of the 4, this is my least favorite.  I did not hate it, I did not dislike it, but if I said I loved it or liked it as much as I like the others, I would be lying.

I was a bit taken aback about the role of the Malfoy's and even Snape, which made this movie interesting, but there was still so much more to be explained.  I suppose we have to wait for the Order of the Phoenix, right?

I would never tell anybody not to see the movie or even purchase it if you like the HP series, but be prepared and understand that this movie is dark and is not as light-hearted and magical as the others.",1161993600,,1164,4.137777777777778
2505357,5,B000E6EK3S,"For The movie:

As a harry potter reader its difficult to review a harry potter movie based on:

1 - You want to like the movie, because you like the whole concept

2 - You find your favorite parts of the book turned into great movie sequences, which you like

3- Then you start to think that so many things were left out of the book, that aren't even explained in the movie, like priori incantatum, i mean, if you haven't read the book, you wouldnt know why harrys parents showed up in the final duel, but in the other hand general audiences didn't care, at least people i saw the movie with.

4- Then you realize that in order to make the movie work most of these things had to go, and new things added, to get audiences attention.

5 - In the end you realize that you liked the movie, that was a fun experience, the most important plot points were treated and wonder how movie 5 will turn out.

The DVD

The dvd is great, great image, great sounds, the extras are great, better than any other Harry Potter DVD, its a good thing that they increase from movie to movie, my favorite extras were the making of the three task (specially the maze) and MEET THE CHAMPIONS, a day in the life of the three actors portraying the three champion.

The deleted scenes i liked, the one with the band not much, but the rest were fine.

Overall a good movie, and a good Dvd.",1160092800,,1361,4.22007722007722

There was not enough important information for someone who had not read the book to have been able to follow the story well.  They also left out alot of important plot lines that are crucial to follow story flow into the next part of the story line. It seem to me that the director/producers of the movie decided that this may be the last movie and that it would not gross at the box office so they just hog poged something together to cut corners on the movies budget.,1157500800,,577,4.293577981651376
2505361,4,B000E6EK3S,"As with the other reviewers, I am a HUGE fan of the Harry Potter book series. That said, I also Loved Goblet of Fire. However, I was a bit disappointed. Of course, the movie could not include every bit of the story. But, they did great jobs on Alastor Moody. OK job on Victor Krum. One big disappointment was Fleur Delacour. In the book, she was supposedly part-Veela. The Fleur in the movie wasn't even all that pretty. Her hair wasn't waist-length and wasn't silver blond. Correcting this would not have made the movie any longer. If they had made the dragon task, as it was in the book, they could have time to add the hilarious bit at the Dursleys. Probably the most disappointing task was the maze. No magic was necessary in at all. And magic is the name of the game in these movies. It wouldn't have taken very much more time to add a monster or two to the maze. We saw Harry use ""Accio..."" twice. I doubt there was any more magic used. I hope ""Order of the Phoenix"" follows the magic!",1157328000,,991,4.304812834224599
2505362,5,B000E6EK3S,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the fourth book in J.K. Rowling's planned 7-book series and is the best of the bunch thus far (although I'm very much anticipating Book 7). I consider the movie version to be right up there with Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban as the best and most adult film in the franchise.

Rowling, with each successive entry, has continued to introduce a darker feel and increasingly less innocent themes. In the Goblet of Fire, we finally witness the advent of Lord Voldemort in physical form (a reptilian Ralph Fiennes), as well as the vicious murders of two people, one a muggle and the other, a key character. On the less perilous though equally bothersome front, Harry, Ron, and Hermione start to wallow in teenage angst, as first-time crushes (Harry and Cho, Ron and Hermione) and petty jealousies (Ron, with Harry) spring forth. Furthermore, Harry must confront the triple menaces of the Triwizard Tournament, the evil Lord Voldemort...and the daunting Yule Ball.

A PG-13 offering, this movie immediately sets an ominous tone with a grim 4 minute opening sequence set in the Riddle house. This dark tone, so prevalent in the film, is alleviated somewhat by occasional touches of humor (for instance, the moments of teen awkwardness leading up to and including the Yule Ball) and the scenes of sheer enchantment and exhilaration (the Quidditch World Cup, Harry's battle with the dragon, the underwater sequence...).

The acting is uniformly excellent. These kids are growing up, getting better, and are producing even more nuanced performances. Emma Watson, to me, is the standout of all the kids. Ralph Fiennes, Miranda Richardson (a great turn as Rita Skeeter), and Brendan Gleeson are welcome additions while the old British guard (Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Michael Gambon, Jason Isaacs) continue their excellent contributions.

The 2nd disc contains a slew of marvelous extra features. The main menu is broken down into four buttons: ""Dragon Arena,"" ""The Lake,"" ""The Maze,"" and ""Hogwarts Castle.""

Clicking on the ""Dragon Arena"" button gives you the option to go to the Triwizard Tournament: Dragon Challenge (where you can play a fun game, competing in any of the three Triwizard tasks), the 6-minute ""Harry Vs. the Horntail: The First Task"" featurette, and  ""Meet the Champions,"" a 13-minute segment breaking down a working day of actors Stanislav Lanevski (Victor Krum), Robert Pattinson (Cedric Diggory), and Clemence Poesy (Fleur De La Coeur).

Choosing ""The Lake"" gives you two options: ""Triwizard Tournament: Lake Challenge"" (it's the same game as above) and the almost 10-minutes long ""In Too Deep: The Second Task"" behind-the-scenes featurette concerning Harry's underwater challenge.

""The Maze"" button takes you to the ""Triwizard Tournament: Maze Challenge"" (yes, same game), ""To the Graveyard and Back Challenge"" (a new game, and pretty cool, even though my remote control sucks), the 7 minutes-long ""The Maze: The Third Task"" featurette, and ""He Who Must Not Be Named"" (an 11-minute in-depth look at Lord Voldemort).

""Hogwarts Castle"" contains: 10 minutes of additional scenes, including a rendition of the Hogwarts school song; the 9-minute ""Preparing for the Yule Ball"" featurette; ""Conversations with the Cast,"" a 30 minute segment of host Richard Curtis speaking with the 3 young leads; later, Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson answer questions from 5 contest winners; the kid actors have ""Reflections on the Fourth Film"" (14 minutes); a theatrical trailer; and dvd-rom for your computer pleasure (an EA game demo, Hogwarts timeline).

Alas, there's no film commentary here. But it's not like they stinted on the other departments.

This film franchise continues to exceed expectations and continues to produce high quality entertainment. With its brand of awesome CGI effects, its gripping storyline, its sensitive portrayal of childhood in a magical environment, and the superlative acting, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, at 157 minutes, is classically enchanting entertainment.

2505373,5,B000E6EK3S,I've loved this film. It's really good and no matter if you have already read the book you will enjoy it.,1157155200,,105,4.0476190476190474
2505374,5,B000E6EK3S,"Based on the fourth book in J.K Rowling's ""Harry Potter"" series, ""The Goblet of Fire"" first hit the big screem in 2005. The film opens at the Weasley family home on the morning of the Quidditch World Cup Final. Although between Ireland and Bulgaria, the match is being played in England, and Harry, Hermione and most of the Weasley clan will be going to it. While Harry finds the event hugely enjoyable, it all goes pear-shaped : the celebrations are ruined by the appearance of a group of Death Eaters (supporters of Voldemort) and the appearance of the Dark Mark (Voldemort's symbol) in the sky.

The international theme continues, however - on reaching Hogwarts, the pupils find out that a Tri-Wizard Tournament will be held during the school year. This is a very famous, not to mention vey dangerous, competition between the three largest European Schools of Wizardry and Witchcraft - Hogwarts, Beauxbatons and Durmstrang. One champion is selected to represent each school and - due to the difficulty and danger of the tasks involved - the Ministry has decided that only students of 17 and over will be allowed to enter. Naturally, this means that - if the rules are adhered to - Harry won't be allowed to enter. Among the visiting students from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang are Victor Krum - who played Seeker for Bulgaria in the World Cup Final - and the highly attractive Fleur Delacour. The visiting students, obviously don't arrive unsupervised - the Headmistress from Beauxbatons is Madame Maxime (who, incredibly, is around even taller than Hagrid) and Professor Karkaroff (a former Death Eater), from Durmstrang.

Inevitably, there's another new Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher at Hogwarts - this year, it's an ex-Auror by the name of Mad-Eye Mooney. An Auror is a Dark Wizard Catcher, and Mooney is widely regarded as one of the best ever. He is now, however, considered a little paranoid - for example, he drinks only (and often) out of his own hip flask. 'Mad Eye' is a pretty apt nickname - he has one 'normal' eye and one magical eye, which can see through doors, walls, invisibility cloaks and even through the back of his own head. There's more to be coped with than new teachers though - there's the expolsive combination of teenage hormones and the impending Yule Ball. Harry has taken a shine to Cho Chang (Ravenclaw's very pretty Seeker, who also has a disarming Scottish accent). Ron, meanwhile, seems somewhat torn between Fleur and - would you believe - Hermione !

In print, ""The Goblet of Fire"" was comfortably the longest book Rowling had written at that point. Similarly, this is also a pretty long movie - though it certainly doesn't drag and is far from boring. Understandably, certain sections have been dropped or tweaked (dammit, no Veela !!), though it's hard to complain as they don't make the film any less enjoyable. Like ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"", the film is quite dark and the effects are very impressive - particularly the horntail. Ron has a tough year, not only falling out with Harry at one point and (later) Hermione, but also having to wear some horrendous dress robes. There are also some laughs, though - some of them centred around Harry's and Ron's attempts to get dates for the Yule Ball.

Some of the supporting characters make big contributions to the movie. Brendan Gleeson is absolutely fantastic as Mad Eye, while Neville is becoming as likeable on-screen as he is in print. Rita Skeeter, played by Miranda Richardson, makes her first appearance. Skeeter is a thoroughly dislikeable hack from the Daily Prophet, who provides some very comic moments. Jarvis Cocker, Pulp's lead singer, appears as the vocalist of the magically popular beat-combo Wyrd Sisters - the band have been hired to play at the Yule Ball. Moaning Myrtle also makes a very welcome reappearance - all too brief, though welcome all the same.

A hugely enjoyable movie and well worth owning. Highly recommended.",1156636800,,3941,4.884902840059791

2505378,4,B000E6EK3S,"Mike Newell takes the helm of the Harry Potter franchise, directing the fourth film ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" based on the hefty novel of the same name by J.K. Rowling. I think it's one of the better adaptions, in terms of flow of plot, even if it omits and augments sizable elements of the book.

It's Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe's) fourth year at Hogwarts, and what a special year it is. Over the summer, Harry got to see the Quidditch world cup, and during the school year, he gets to compete in the Triwizard Tournament. The only problem is, he isn't actually supposed to be in it. It is only for students over 17, and only for three champions to compete in. Harry is 14, and is the fourth champion. Has someone planted his name? Has the Goblet of Fire, the magical artifact that makes such decisions, made a mistake? The Triwizard Tournament is very dangerous, perhaps someone wants to see him died. With new faces, a strange new teacher and an upcoming school dance, it turns out to be a very hectic year, and one that will change the lives of all concerned forever.

If you've read the book, you'll notice that a lot of side plots have been cut out of the film. We don't see the Dursley family at all, nor do we see the Creeveys. Dobby, Winky and the kitchen of house elves are completely absent, and their actions important to the plot given to other characters. Sirius Black, apart from a small scene, is missing too. We don't even get to see any Veelas! Still, I didn't find it a major point. It keeps the plot pacy and the film shorter, and you still can follow everything, even if you haven't read the book, which can't be said about all of these films. However, I really would have liked to have seen more of the Quidditch World Cup, the scenes from which were way too quick and cut up. What is with modern filmmakers avoiding slow paced beginnings? Annoys me a lot, that particular trend.

All the kids growing up, which has always been interesting to watch. The school dance scenes are nicely done, and there's plenty of awkwardness and embarassment between the sexes, a little exaggerated, but that just adds to the color and humour of the scenes. It A few new faces in the cast, including David Tennant, the man who has just recently become the 10th Doctor Who, as Barty Crouch Jr. British character actor Mark Williams once again plays Mr Weasley. It's interesting, because here we get to see him play angry, furious in fact, something I've never seen him do terribly often, and I'm a fan of his. It's a far cry from campy menswear salesman of ""The Fast Show"" and the rough and tumble Olaf Petersen of ""Red Dwarf"". Also, check out the band that plays in the school dance. It features Jarvis Cocker of Britpop band Pulp, plus two members of Radiohead (Johnny Greenwood and Phil Selway). Don't really get to see them much though.

The special effects were pretty standard fare. I mean, they're detail, but there's no giant leaps, CG seems more an institution rather than an innovation here. Did they have a lower budget or something? Even the DVD seems a little more cheaply, it terms of presentation.

Still special features, like always, are many and varied, though the way they're displayed is a little more subdued and static than the last couple of Harry Potter DVD volumes. There's about 9 minutes worth of deleted scenes. Rather than being put in a menu to choose from, they are all stuck together as one long montage, which I found a little bit annoying. A couple of them are worth a mention. There a performance Hogwarts School Song by the school (whose lyrics you can find in Rowling's first Harry Potter book), and a full song by the Wyrd Sisters band. There's the featurette ""Preparing for the Yule Ball"", a behind the scenes look at the school dance scenes. There's the 30 minute ""Conversations With The Cast"" hosted by Richard Curtis, which features a lengthy interview with Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watston. It also features questions by fans who won a competition to meet the cast. There's ""Reflections on the Fourth Film"", a featurette which shows the cast at work and at play. There's a behind the scenes featurette for each of the tri-wizard tasks, which show us interviews with the ever hard working CG/SFX guys, plus a little bit from the cast. There's a ""Meet the Champions"" feature, with interviews and plenty of behind the scenes banter and fly on the wall antics with the actors who play the Triwizard Champions. There's a featurette on Voldemort, and there's the original theatrical trailer too.

As in all the other DVDs, there are the games, this time based on the tasks of the Triwizard Tournament. For the most part I found these to be most frustrating. They were the sort of games where you have to press your remote at exactly the right time and exactly the right way, games that don't give you too many times to make mistakes. It's more about remembering a sequence than fun. The maze was the best of them, a lot like an RPG video game, complete with computer animated characters. You can choose your school and cast spells on the nasty creatures within, plus you can take your time. It was pretty atmospheric for a bonus feature, and features things from the maze mentioned in the book but not in the film (like the mysterious golden mist). If you manage to get through those games, you can have a run through Voldemort's graveyard, which is a reasonable mini-game.

It's worth a look, but I'd check out the previous titles in the series first, be they books or DVD.",1155168000,,5541,4.5852674066599395

I agree with many of the other reviewers here regarding the disappointing portrayal of Dumbledore since the replacement of Richard Harris, particularly in this 4th installment. Yet, the wonderfully thought-out performance of Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort makes up for it! I especially enjoyed the interview with him as part of the extras with this edition, because it called attention to details he brought to the character that I may not have noticed otherwise. Until the 6th book was released, the 4th was my favorite in the series, and considering how rich a novel it is, I think the representation of the wizarding schools, the tournament and the growing dangers of this magical world were portrayed quite well overall. Although I initially disliked the 3rd film I find it's become my favorite over time, but the 4th has some wonderful things to offer as well with the talented cast of British actors the franchise has collected throughout the series. Oh, but a little sidenote about a specific moment: I wasn't wild about the modern music at the ball... I understand that the films are attempting to portray a modern wizarding world, but it seemed very out of context with Hogwarts in my opinion.  At times this film seemed to be trying a bit too hard for it's own good.",1154822400,,1293,4.872727272727273

There is some sexual innuendo as well that was completely absent in the three preceding films.  It is like the director is trying to mature the audience - make them more grown-up - to prepare them for the dark turn the franchise is taking.

The story takes place as fourth-year Harry has his name mysteriously entered in the Tri-Wizard Tournament, a dangerous magic Olympics between three schools of magic.  Romance ensues as the stalwart Victor Krum pursues Hermione, and Harry has a huge crush on Cho Chang, a fellow Hogwart's student.  Not to mention Hagrid is sweet on the headmistress of Beaux Baton School of Magic for Girls.  Harry is haunted by a recurring dream about Lord Voldemort.  The World Cup of Quidditch also takes place, where Voldemort's supporters make a terrifying appearance.

Nevertheless, Goblet of Fire is vastly entertaining with astounding special effects.  Very magical atmosphere, with the real terror held off towards the end.  Two deaths in the film are sobering.",1154736000,,1093,4.956043956043956

I give the makers of the Harry Potter films credit for trusting the audiences and allowing the younger actors to grow impresive ly into their roles. I find that this particular installment was more complex and detailed than the others. It is a darker story with Harry facing not only The Triwizard Tournament, but his greatest challenge, puberty. Daniel Radcliffe has grown immeensly as a younger actor. He was 15 when he shot this film and he make Harry complex yet simple, couragous and brave, yet filled with the angst of being a teenager facing, honestly worse situations than most of us will ever deal with. Ditto for Rupert Grint and Emma Watson , both more comic and beautiful as they grow older. My main complaint is Dumbledore. He seems to be too angry and scared, not wise and confident.

I loved reading the 4th book of the series, and was anticipating somewhat a letdown with this film.  My worring turned out to be for not.  While the pace of the movie is sometimes hard to keep up with, for the time they (producers, director, ect.) had and the number of pages with the novel, I can understand the speed of the 4th film.  A plus, for me at least, was the rating of the movie- PG13 proving that the series is not some little kiddie (3 and under) show.  The only real need for this rating is near the end of the film.  The actors again prove themselves well as the beloved characters they portray.  Harry, Ron, and Hermione's (misspelt?) actors grow up fairly close to the Harry, Ron, and Hermione from the book.  A fun introduction to the cast is Volde""He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named""mort's actor; Ralph Fiennes with a touch of femine facial features.

In addition, I thought I had a bad copy, but it turned out that my PS2 may be on its way out, as the DVD played perfectly on a normal DVD player.

The CGI has greatly improved since the horrible excuse for Lupin's werewolf form in Prisoner of Azkaban.  It was both interesting and distrubing to see Moaning Myrtle get perverted with Harry.  Although not as glaring as some of the liberties taken with the previous movie, some of the changes were again for the worst.

Even so, it was as always, a fun interpretation of the series in a different medium.",1153699200,,721,4.6015625
2505391,4,B000E6EK3S,"I had high-hopes for this movie when it came out in theatres. I was suspicious that the director and script writers might have traveled too far away from the book, as most movies based on books do quite often. But to my surprise, this movie stayed very close to the book.

If it had strayed from the book further, would it have still been a good movie? Perhaps so. But the book by J.K. Rowling was such a masterpiece, that this movie had a lot to live up to. By default, the expectations of every fan were very high.

And those expectations were rewarded! Not only did 'Goblet' stay close to the original story, but when it did add new elements, those elements helped the story along! For instance, the dragon chasing Harry for the First Task of the Triwizard Tournament was just astounding as far as suspense and visuals go! The CGI for the dragon was top-notch state-of-the-art! I was very pleased.

All the Tasks were done probably as best as they could have been done by the hands of directors and computer artists. So if you are looking for a movie that is entertaining, visually stunning, and captivating, then this is without a doubt a movie you would enjoy.

Where are some of the lower points of the movie?

The main nit-pick I have with this movie is the characterization of Dumbledore in one of the scenes. After Harry's name flew from the Goblet, all of Hogwarts was shocked and confused. Dumbledore actually grabs and pushes Harry, asking him if he put his name in the cup. This is understandable, since Dumbledore was concerned for Harry's safety and well-being, but if you have ever read the book you will know this is not how the character of Dumbledore would act in such a situation.

Another lower point, was the angst that Hermione exhibited near the end of the Yule Ball. Why exactly did she get mad at Ron? I don't know. I guess because Ron didn't support her in her 'fraternizing with the enemy.' However, the scene came off as a little too much. I think this was just overacting on Emma Watson's part.

On a last note, I will say this movie is better than the ones that came before it, in that it has a strong story, strong characters, very touching and heart-felt moments, and above all: adventure! I suggest this movie, preferably the DVD itself, as it has many bonus features that are worth watching.

This DVD is worth the money.",1153612800,,2356,4.514084507042254
2505392,4,B000E6EK3S,"The earlier Harry Potter films have moments of quiet whimsy, where J.K. Rowling's universe is fleshed out.  This 4th installment, the Goblet of Fire, is so jam-packed that there is no time for anything that doesn't service one of the 2 main plots.  The first plotis about the Triwizard Tournament - a deadly competition to determine the greatest of the three magical schools: the British co-ed Hogwarts, the Bulgarian male-only Durmstrang, and the French all-girls school Beauxbaton.  This plot contains all the action of the film, and includes some dramatic special-effects sequences, including a battle with a dragon and a wand-weilding climactic battle.  The second plot contains the character-development aspects of the film: associated with the Triwizard Tournament is a Grand Ball, and our heroes must find dates and deal with puberty-induced angst.  Especially effective in this part of the film is Emma Watson's portrayal of nerdish Hermione.  Instead of being only the Mr. Spock-like logician to Ron and Harry, she gets to show some real emotion when Harry and Ron treat her like one of the guys, rather than see her as a date prospect for the ball.

It is well that the filmmakers focussed on these two plots, as Rowling's book is 600+ pages.  Obviously, much of the detail of the book is missing.  For example, we only see one class during the entire year, and that is to introduce the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, who plays a pivotal role in the story.  We see not a single Potions class with Prof. Snape.  We don't even see Prof. Sprout (Herbology), a Quidditch match, a House Elf, or Nearly-Headless Nick.  Even so, newcomers to the series are likely to be scratching their heads in parts - for example, Harry contacts Sirius Black but no mention is made in the film who he is (he's Harry's godfather).

That's not to say that the film isn't enjoyable or rich in detail.  If it takes a cavalier attitude in trimming all but the essentials from the two main plotlines, it must do so in order to keep the movie focussed.  At 2.5 hours, it's none too short, but the time flies by because the performances are very good and the action sequences last just long enough (but not too long!)

This bare-bones DVD contains absolutely no extras - not even the audio commentary, not even the film's trailer.  I would recommend that anyone with even the remotest interest in the series should go with the special-edition 2-disc set instead (especially since it's the same price, at least it was when I wrote this review).",1153612800,,2536,4.793103448275862
2505393,4,B000E6EK3S,"A fable of good against evil, seen from a dark place. I don't know what coloured J K Rowling's childhood to make her create such phantasmagoric horrors, but I suspect she read a lot of the same books I did; bits of Mervyn Peake's ""Titus Groan"" series, Grimm's Fairy Tales, even for some reason W H Hudson's classic (and hard to find) ""A Little Boy Lost"" came to mind watching this latest installment of the Harry Potter saga. All were favourites when I was a child; all are dark. We've covered our children's stories in cosmetics in the last generation or so, and we're not doing kids any favours that way. As one of the characters, Alastair Moody, says, you have to be prepared.

""Dark and difficult times lie ahead,"" Professor Dumbledore intones to Harry. ""Soon we all will have to make the choice between what is right and what is easy.""

This is the most foreboding of the series so far, which fits, as that is the way the books are going. That said, as is often the case, the book is far superior to the movie (your own imagination is always a better funhouse than somebody else's) although the creators of this one - of all of them - do an admirable job. It's difficult to see the kids grow up, but that's just me; you get that way when you get to where I am. I must say Hermione is becoming quite a beauty, and her acting chops (I should say Emma Watson's acting chops) are getting better all the time. Robbie Coltrane didn't have much of a part here, nor did Alan Rickman (Severus Snape), two of everybody's favourites; but an unrecognizable (thankfully) Ralph Fiennes added definition to Lord Voldemort. Mr Fiennes does evil quite well.

This is not a movie for young children, even though I said, in effect, that we should not coddle them but show the world for the hard, wicked place it is (and has always been). It is grim, cautionary, and frightening in spots, and promises an even darker next installment.

  Moody: Gleeson doesn't quite fill Mad-Eye's boots, seems tempted to ham it up a little.  For me, Moody's less flamboyant, more hard-bitten, harsher featured.

  Voldemort: Ralph Fiennes, a fine actor, is sort of wasted in such a one-dimensional role.  Not his fault, but whence all the accolades?

While the different details and storylines of the book are highly entertaining to read, they don't all stick in my memory. The stuff that did stick though ends up being (for the most part) what makes it into the movie.

And my husband, who hasn't read any of the books, enjoyed Goblet of Fire too. He didn't seem to be confused by all the characters or plot lines - perhaps because he's seen the 3 previous movies.

2505398,3,B000E6EK3S,"I generally try to focus on the movie itself without reference to the book it was based upon, but I had a hard time with this one. The Goblet of Fire was possibly my favorite book in the series, and I looked forward to this movie a lot. In itself the movie was enjoyable, but I left the theater angry. The writers and directors clearly had to condense the story line and that's totally understandable. What totally ticked me off was that they cut out important scenes from the book in order to put a lot of ""Hollywood"" scenes in their place. The dancing lesson didn't exist in the book, but it was funny. And it took up valuable time in an already long movie. The dragon scene could have been half as long, but I guess that is more exciting than the real drama of the story. The scene which absolutely angered me was a non-scene. They took the time at the beginning of the movie to show Moody's foe glass, which shows when his enemies are drawing near. It was a key element of foreshadowing in the book, and should have been in the movie, but they forgot to add the follow-up at the end of the movie! Why foreshadow something if you're not going to refer to it again later on?? Again, a waste of valuable time.

I could look over the total lack of certain characters from the book because it didn't really bother me. But it leaves out key information. I happened to go with somebody who had never read the book, and he couldn't begin to understand some of the story lines. We are left hanging at the end of the movie. They don't bother to explain how Barty Crouch escaped from Azkaban and assumed Moody's identity, they completely left out that the Ministry ""finished off"" Crouch before they could find out the truth of Voldemort's return, and they didn't bother to point out that the Minister refused to believe that Voldemort did indeed return. Maybe not such a big deal for a movie, but for a movie with a definite sequel, that's a key teaser right there!! I thought putting a teaser at the end of the first movie is a good prompter to see the following one.

In all, I am afraid I couldn't get past the errors of omission. It was a disappointment for me as a fan of the series, but it was also a disappointment as a general movie-goer who is left hanging at the end with a lot of unanswered questions.",1152144000,,2305,4.321016166281755
2505399,4,B000E6EK3S,"Though I've never read any of the books in this series I can tell that part of Rowling's popularity stems from her ability to infuse the epic element into her popular children's books.  The Harry Potter story is not a superficial or predictable story-rather it is a story of near epic proportions that takes place in a world that is very rich both in detail and in history.  This is why I, at least, find the movies so compelling.  They're entertaining for kids, sure, but (like CS Lewis's Narnia series) adults can enjoy the story as well.  And the overall effect (that epic quality) is that the entire world in which these movies take place is one in which a thousand stories could be told.  This richness is why I like Harry Potter so much.

 The movies have always done a great job of preserving the epic feel while still remaining very entertaining.  Unfortunately this movie didn't quite do that for me-maybe it's because of the length of the corresponding book.  For whatever reason, I felt left out of some of the ""lore"" of the movie, and found myself with questions about characters and events and wanting to know more.  The entertainment value is still here, of course, and this movie was definitely worth seeing.  But for the first time I felt like, since I was watching the movie without having read the book, I was missing out.

Maybe this movie would benefit from an ""Extended Version"" going into more detail of some of the `back stories.'  I know that's certainly something I'd be interested in.

2505412,5,B000E6EK3S,"It must be incredibly hard to condense an epic book the size of ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" into a movie less than three hours, especially with a legion of hundreds of thousand of wild fans ready to break into violence if their favorite subplots are omitted, so we have to give the screen writers for this film credit in that department, to start off with.

As the films get increasingly darker and the content gets more and more adult, they seem to get BETTER as well.  I'll start off with the bad parts so I can get right down to the good: The explanation of ""Prior Incantatem"" in the end of the movie was lacking, and as it is key to how the main conflict was resolved in the film, it should have been delved into deeper, as should have Harry's relationship with Sirius Black.  While it seems things move a bit too fast at first, upon second and third viewings, all falls into place.  There is one major problem I have with the film, though:  Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore is so far off of the mark that I can scarcely believe that the director did not send him off the set in a dunce cap.  The real Dumbledore is composed, unlike Gambon's version.

Onto the good: Snape (played by Alan Rickman) is great as always, though he doesn't get much screen time.  Rupert Grint (playing Harry's best friend Ron) shines as always, and while Emma Watson (Hermione) is still finding herself as an actress, she does well.  Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) was never better than he is in this movie, and the movie-goers will be able to laugh, cry, and scream with him.  The actors who play Cedric, Fleur, McGonagall, and Hagrid are all on point, but the shining actor of the movie is Ralph Finnes, who plays the most evil dark wizard of all time, Lord Voldemort.

The graveyard scene with Voldemort is frightening, and by far the best scene ever filmed for the whole franchise.  It could have gone wrong in so many ways, but it is utterly perfect, and terrifyingly real.  The way Ralph Finnes moves so smoothly, then bursts into an explosive thrust, the way he whispers threats, and then barks orders... Frightening.  Beautiful.

Other scenes that are well done include:  Brendan Gleeson (as Mad Eye Moody) demonstrating the Unforgivable Curses, especially when he introduced the Imperius Curse as humorous only to slowly bring the class to the severe reality of it:  The Yule Ball is beautifully angsty, and the scenery is breath-taking, as is that of the tasks of the Triwizard Tournament.

Overall, this movie is by far the strongest of the four already released, and it has a very, very high replay value.  For your own sake, go out and get the DVD as soon as you can.

2505413,5,B000E6EK3S,"Goblet of Fire is the best of the 4 Harry Potter movies so far and if this is any indication, they will only get better. Director Mike Newell went a different direction with the tone of the characters and the scenery than previous directors of the first three movies, and did it to perfection. This being the 4th book, the overall tone of the story is getting darker and darker, so the movie really needed to capture that feeling of dread that the books bring to life so well. You know something bad is going to happen but you keep reading to find out just how bad it's going to get, Newell brought that to life... too bad he only gets to direct this one.

This movie is very good. It has amazing special effects, decent acting with the exception of Watson - who overacts constantly, and last but not least a very mature story that was adopted perfectly from the best selling book.",1151798400,,881,4.371951219512195
2505414,2,B000E6EK3S,"In a nutshell: glossy but sometimes too much like a typical high school film and not enough of an epic. Certain subplots and resolutions were cut, for better or worse (SPEW, Rita Skeeter's come uppance)

Dan Radcliffe is still fine in his role, but Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are still horrible in theirs. Let's face it: the filmmakers never understood the characters of Ron & Hermione and never understood their dynamic, and the lackluster handling of the Yule Ball, with over the top acting from Watson and virtually no acting from Grint, just proves that the filmmakers completely failed with them (and I'm saying that as someone who always thought the Yule Ball was a bloated, overblown chapter). Not to mention that Watson, who cannot act to save her life, looked like a giant bottle of Pepto Bismol in that ugly eye soar of a hideous pink dress (originally a blue dress in the book).

Ron & Hermione pretty much no longer exist in the films at this point. These characters Grint & Watson are playing are not Ron & Hermione and never will be. Watson has always played Hermione as more of a shallow, spoiled school princess than a well meaning bookworm, and she comes off as being kinda bitchy, so you don't really feel any sympathy for her when Ron ""ruins"" her night out. Grint has almost always played Ron as a useless coward (with help from the filmmakers). These 2 unappealing characterizations just aren't worth it.",1151712000,,1426,4.7

Now Harry must confront a deadly dragon, fierce water demons and an enchanted maze only to find himself in the cruel grasp of He Who Must Not Be Named. In this forth film adaption of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, everything changes as Harry, Ron & Hermione leave childhood forever and take on challenges greater than anything they could have imagined.",1151366400,,597,4.920792079207921
2505418,4,B000E6EK3S,"First of all, I must mention that Goblet of Fire is my favourite Harry Potter book, and so I expected great things from this movie. And great things I did get, but they were entirely unexpected.

The movie starts off just like the book, except since the Durselys have been cut out, Harry is shaken awake by Hermione in The Burrow. This itself gives us a glimpse into Mike Newell's thought process. It might please H/Hr shippers to know that director Mike Newell and writer Steve Kloves seem to be H/Hr advocators themselves. It's not so much as the fact that they show Harry and Hermione to be better friends than Ron and Hermione, which isn't really true to the books, it more the fact that they've made Hermione tag along or take care of Harry in several scenes. The crucial scene between Hermione and Ron and the end of the Yule Ball is a little lost due to all the H/Hr-ness of this movie.

As the subject matter of the Goblet of Fire book was too vast, many scenes in the movie have been sliced so that it deals with action rather than explanations. In a way, this works. On the other hand, Potter fans will surely expect some more details, and this, I predict will be the main negative response to Newell's work. The end particularly requires an explanation. Newell leaves things a bit up in the air. But this doesn't mean the movie is bad or disappointing. At least not for me. It is filled with laugh-out-loud moments, thrilling action sequences and a few new surprises that will captivate you. Truly, It has some wonderful scenes which seem like they've been plucked from your imagination. The emergence of Durmstrang's ship, the portkey and Voldemort's rebirth, for instance.

And speaking of Voldemort, I must say Ralph Fiennes has done a remarkable job. The make up artist and computer animation guys must have worked hard too - Voldemort looks just as evil and scary as he should! This is one of the reasons that the movie has received a PG-13 rating. The highly suggestive yet hilarious scene with Myrtle and Harry in the Prefects bathroom, as well as a few very suggestive dialogues here and there also explain the rating.

The movie's casting has been tastefully done. The new actors have managed to remain true to the characters that they play, and are very believable. Miranda Richardson makes a fantastic Rita Skeeter. The scene in the broom cupboard is particularly funny. Stanislav Ianevski (Krum) and Robert Pattinson (Cedric) are well cast and play their roles well. Clmence Posy makes a good Fleur Delacour, but Mike Newell should have let her keep her hair down. Although I guess it wasn't strictly necessary since the reason she would have had her hair down has been conveniently cut from the movie!

Unexpectedly, Matthew Lewis and Brendan Gleeson gave very good performances. Matthew Lewis, although he has grown out of his short and pudgy first-movie form and has become tall and slim, has nonetheless managed to keep Neville alive and kicking. There are many funny scenes involving him. As for Brendan Gleeson, I didn't think much of him as `Mad-Eye' Moody when I saw the trailers and the teaser pictures. But he makes a great Moody, crazy, loud and sometimes scary.

There was much debate about the casting of Frances de la Tour as Madame Maxime as many seemed to think that she didn't fit the part. I can see their point, since she isn't the best Maxime they could have got, but she wasn't too bad. Pedja Bjelac (also known as Predrag, in case you're wondering) made a wonderful Karkaroff.

As for the carry-over actors from the last movie into this one, I have to say that I am most impressed with Emma Watson's performance. (and of course Matthew Lewis, whom I have already mentioned.) Emma manages to capture the essence of 14-year-old Hermione quite well. Rupert Grint gives his 100% Ron. Sometimes it's hard not to imagine Ron as Rupert while reading the books. Daniel Radcliffe, the `star' himself, has greatly improved in terms of acting since Prisoner of Azkaban and, although his performance is uneven, he still manages to be a convincing Harry. The Phelps Twins are remarkable as Fred and George and entertain with their hilarious banter and excellent screen presence. Bonnie Wright (Ginny) has a bigger role in this movie than in any of the others. She has almost no dialogue, but is present in many scenes here and there, which is something. Tom Felton, too, has a very small role. In fact he's only present in three scenes, one of which I am pleased to announce involves Professor Moody and a hilarious bit of transfiguration.

Anyay, I thought it was strange that the Death Eaters shared wardrobes with the KKK, and the Quidditch World Cup made its appearance for only three seconds. What was that about?

2505420,3,B000E6EK3S,"Okay, I just watched Harry Potter: The Goblet of Fire.

--SPOILERS--

Like I have said about a great many films by now:

wonderful visuals, but...

I am afraid I just found it unrealistic. While I have no trouble believing in dragons and transformation spells, several things just rubbed me the wrong way. The main one is the big contest itself. Apparently we are to believe that the leaders of a great school, supposedly responsible and good people, will host a contest, a glorified sports event, where teenage students are in imminent mortal danger, and do in fact die?

Not only that, but they will kidnap innocent kids at fourteen, who have NOT signed up for it, and bind them with chains deep under a lake, only to survive if the ""champions"" are skillful and lucky enough? (Two of them actually only survived because Harry was willing to give his own life if needed.)

And not only that, but after a student finally dies, not one student, not one parent, stands up and says: ""enough, you have maliciously or recklessly killed this boy. This is not the kind of school I signed up for, we are leaving. Expect our last cheque to bounce.""

Not only that, the school board knows that Harry did not sign himself up for the contest, and yet they force him to go through with it, even though he is not ready or old enough by a long stretch, and is highly likely to die.

I say pooh. Either the filmmakers botched it up bad and left out some sorely needed explanations, or Rowling wrote a pretty bad book there.",1150156800,,1507,4.4945054945054945
2505421,5,B000E6EK3S,"Being an avid Harry Potter fan, I had been anticipating the release of the film for months, and i was there at the cinema the day it was released! And bought the DVD the day it was released!

This is the fourth in the Harry Potter series, and when things start to get oh so much darker for Harry!

The books and films of 1-3, harry is young and getting used to living the rest of his life as a wizard; what shock it must be to a young 12 year old boy!

And now, in his fourth year at Hogwarts, after already coming face to face with several forms of 'he who should not be named', harrys nightmares are becoming worse and more vivid; and he ends up being selected to participate in the tri-wazard tournament... all is not well in hogwarts..

The film I feel captured the darkness that is coming over the wizarding world, although obviosuly a lot has to be missed out due to time restrictions.

Coming from a major fan of the books, i am most happy with this film, in comparison to 1 and 3; I felt some essences of the books, like harry maturing and becoming interested in girls- had a lot of comical value, brought out superbly by Ron (my favourite!-Rupert Grint, what a stud!!)

however, other issues, like the majority of the school turning agaist harry for a stage, was really too obviosuly represented in a couple of scenes which were blatently put there to keep in the aspect from the books. Had I directed it, this would have been a more underlining issue.

Also, you may then notice some of the issues that have been changed from the book--> film. Like Neville providing the gillyweed for Harry, as apposed to the house elf. Additionally, Hermione seems to be constantly nearly in tears in the film, but with not much justification; this would be understood why more to a experienced reader.

The film had me in tears, laughter, and on the end of my seat-exactly what the book did to me. I would reccomend it to anyone, young and old; but highly suggest the books are read first; you will have a deeper issue of the politics that are going on-which will also be beinificial for the rest of the books and films.",1150070400,,2116,4.380102040816326

2505423,3,B000E6EK3S,"I viewed the Goblet of Fire, with believe it or not, someone who was unfamiliar with the Potter books and previous Potter movies.

Unless you are Potter oriented, the movie won't make any sense what-so-ever.

I had to even explain that Fred and George were Ron's brothers. There wasn't any family connection mentioned through the dialogue...such as ""Wait till Mom hear's about this!"" or ""I'll never live down being related to you much less being your brother!"" Or other such familiar phrases that siblings echo to one another.  My friend thought that Fred and George were Cedric's brothers.

I had to explain about snake language and being a Parsel Mouth.  I had to explain about Lord Voldemort.  I had to explain Hogwarts! I had to explain Sirius in the fire.  I had to explain the absent Dursleys.  All of these problems could have easily been addressed with a few sentences of dialogue, but because they weren't ... the movie won't be able to stand on its own through time.

The Goblet of Fire didn't expand and capitalize on some of its amazing footage.  I wanted to see more of the Quidditch match and more of the phenomenal stadium that was generated for it in the beginning of the movie.  Instead of being amazed, I felt cheated. A few seconds longer would have been alot more satisfying.

A few seconds longer would be an improvement just about anywhere in the movie.  Cliff notes would have done a better job condensing the book.  The movie was way too short for the ground it attempted to cover. There was no character developement at all.

All in all, for those of us who know what is going on, it is a lavish production very richly done.  There are some fantastic CGI scenes with the dragon, as well as the arrival of the guest Academies.  Again, in my opinion, not long enough.

Goblet of Fire  book is my favorite of the series...as it is for many.  The volume had the greatest potential of becoming the 'signature flick' of the Potter franchise to be viewed again and again over generations to come.  Alas!...it is not to be with so many holes in the story...the movie should be renamed ""Harry Potter and the Leaky Cauldron of Fire"".

I have seen the previous HP movies, and I must say these are becoming like the Star Wars franchise, 'if it has Harry Potter's name on it, it will sell regardless of content'.

First the good.  As usual, the visual effects save the movie.  They are great, except the ridiculous CGI mermaids during the water contest scenes.  Sadly, that's all the good I can say about this film.

I actually found myself glancing at my watch and praying for the end of this extremely LONG movie.  First, the plot has become predictable in these stories.  Rest assured that if a new teacher is introduced, they are most likely to be the villain.  We find the kids back at Hogwart's, starting a new year of school.  The entire story revolves around a contest where the child participants face death if they lose.  What kind of school is this?  There is no suspense when Harry Potter's name is picked from the goblet, because we already know he survives to the next story.  The story introduces characters that have no purpose to move the story along.  For example, the asian girl that Harry Potter has the hots for has like 2 lines of dialogue, and we never see her again.  Huh?  There is a mind numbingly long ball room dance scene which ruins the pace of the film.

As always, the movie strangely ends just before school is out, after numerous plot holes that a 18 wheeler could fall through.  I won't ruin the film by divulging anymore info, except to say this installment is mediocre at best.",1149033600,,1636,4.447811447811448

There are other signs - a celebration is disrupted by the notorious Deatheaters, anti-muggle wizards and witches who's hatred of non-magic users is only surpassed by their fanatical devotion to Lord Voldermort. and who's calling card is a death's head in the sky with a serpent.  ""Hogwarts is no longer safe"" warns Sirius Black, and rightfully so, as Harry is drawn into a web of treachery and horror.  Will Harry win?  Will Harry survive?

Well, people, hold onto your brooms, because The Goblet of Fire makes the Prisoner of Azkaban look like a romp in the park!  From the opening scenes, there is no question that this is going to be a very suspensful, unnerving, and shocking movie.  It lasts the better part of two and one half hours, which means it should become boring.

But it doesn't.  It grabs the viewer's attention and doesn't let go.  It is exciting, humerous, touching, tragic, but never, I say again, NEVER boring.  Harry, Ron, and Hermoine are no longer little eleven year olds but teenagers and allowed to act as such with all the adorable awkwardness that implies.  Neville Longbottom is also made more mature, he is no longer used for simple comic relief.  Instead of trying to deny the existence of adolescence, those responsible for the Goblet of Fire work with it, the end result being characters that are believable, amusing, and, despite their magic, human!

Also, the English accents of the actors in this movie in particular really made it hard to understand what they say. In other Harry Potter films, I never had this problem, but with this one... another story, subtitles help of course. But the beginning in particular was rushed.

From the standpoint of someone who read the book-absolute rubbish, .1 stars, hated it! :Please don't write another review saying that you shouldn't listen to me, this is an opinion. For one thing, I was quite angrey they showed none of the Quiddich world cup game! That was what I thought would be one of the coolest parts of the movie. When they suddenly transitioned to Harry in the tent, I thought, ""What, what happened?! Where's the Quidditch Game!!!"" They also totally took out the character Winky, the house elf who conjoured the Dark Mark at the Quidditch Cup (though I may be wrong, I haven't read the book in a while). All the stuff with the Hogwarts Kitchens, and such. They took out how Rita Skeeter's article makes Hermione get bullied at like Harry (the article was there, but nothing else) and about how RITA SKEETER IS AN ANIMAGUS AND CAN TURN INTO A BEETLE! That was a crutial element they took out, and I don't know how they will pull off the Half-Blood Prince(?) film when Rita is forced to write an article about Harry, and if they took that out, than Cho would have no reason to cry and leave when he mentions meeting Hermione, and if they take out the entire part, there is no reason Cho is mad at Harry later. If you've never read the book this must be very confusing.

But overall from a reader of the book's perspective, the movie was cluttered with much taken out that I feel ws important. I do agree with people who say that they need to take out details to make an 810 page book into much shorter films. I also agree with those who said they spend way too much time on their social life, not enough on the story. If they took out more social stuff, more of the story could be put in.

In ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"" the fourth installment in the perennially popular series by J. K. Rowling, the young wizards seem to have a bit more on their minds than just flying around on broomsticks and casting spells.  For along with puberty come activated hormones and a sudden burgeoning interest in the opposite sex.  This brings a nice grown-up dimension to a series that continues to enchant young and old alike with its constantly renewing creativity and imagination.

All, however, is not puppy love romance and fancy dress balls, for there is still the serious business of wizardry to be done at Hogwarts Academy.  In this edition, Harry is compelled to take part in the Tri-Wizard Tournament, a sort of Olympic Games for magicians that is so intense that it has resulted in the deaths of a few of the participants in the past.  In order to win the prize of the goblet of fire, the contestant must face three challenges - a battle with dragons, an underwater rescue of some kidnapped friends, and a trip through an elaborate maze, with the goal in each case being the capturing of a mysterious giant egg.  At the base of the contest lies the evil Lord Voldemort (a creepy Ralph Fiennes), who is, as always, trying to eliminate young Mr. Potter by any means necessary.

Although a bit long at two hours and thirty-six minutes, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" still manages to breathe new life into a franchise that should by all rights be turning pretty stale by now.  It does so partly through some really fine set pieces - i.e. the challenges - partly through the high flying imaginativeness of so much of the storyline, partly through the endearing relationships among the various characters, and partly through the performance of Daniel Radcliffe, who keeps Harry Potter lifelike, compelling and interesting as an everyman hero.  The tone is also remarkably dark in the later stretches of the film, as is befitting the advancing ages of the characters, although very young children might find some of the scenes a trifle disturbing, so be forewarned.

2505446,4,B000E6EK3S,"Having read the first 5 Harry Potter books at least 7 times each, I have to say that I know a bit about the books. That being said, I think Goblet of Fire was the best movie in the series so far. Some people are saying that Prisoner of Azkaban was much better, it was brilliant, it was stunningly beautiful, etc. It seems like you either loved that movie or hated it. After watching it about 6 times I finally started to understand why people like it. However, there is no comparison between it and Goblet of Fire.

First, the faults. Goblet of Fire did cut out certain key parts of the film, like explaining priori incantantem, or Harry giving the Weasley twins the money to start their joke shop. But those aren't even the most important cut scenes! The torture of the Longbottoms was mentioned once in passing, and I'm almost positive that people who haven't read the book would not have noticed. Even Snape being a former death eater was not pronounced as important. Even Cedric being murdered by VOLDEMORT didn't have an effect on the students at the end of the movie.

Another problem with the movie was the music. This is Harry Potter, not a teen love movie. The music at the end of the Yule Ball when Hermione was arguing with Ron was ridiculous. I suddenly felt as though I'd been pulled into a teen romance; it was actually kind of disturbing. Even the music when Ron first confronted Harry about putting his name into the goblet was strange; it sounded like a couple was about to split up. The music definitely could have been better.

But while there are faults with the movie, there are positives as well. The more minor characters had more important roles in this movie. I was glad to finally see the Weasley twins acting like they do in the book. Neville's character was actually seen; even Ginny had a few lines.

This movie was also by far the funniest movie in the series. I was laughing probably half of the time.

The actors definitely improved. Rupert Grint (Ron) was great. Daiel Radcliffe (Harry) has always seemed a little weak at his acting skills, but he improved too, despite the pathetic crying scene at the end when he returned to Hogwarts with Cedric's body. Emma Watson (Hermione) seemed very stressed out in this movie, but at least she tries. Even Tom Felton (Draco) improved a little, although I couldn't really tell becasue he was barely in the movie (which was kind of disappointing).

So, to summarize, although the movie has its downfalls, it is, in my opinion, the best of the series so far, and definitely worth buying (the 2-disc special edition!)",1147132800,,2588,4.590909090909091
2505447,4,B000E6EK3S,"As you can tell from the title I am a big fan of the Harry Potter series book.  I've read every single one she has written and absolutely adore everyone.

Now to the point of reviewing this film.  The Goblet of Fire was the first book I read from the Harry Potter series and it was the one that sparked my interest in reading the rest of the books.  The book was awesome and had a very enjoyable time reading it.  The movie on the other hand was a little bit of a let down (Not too much though).  The one thing the movie really left out a lot of was Choe Chang's part with Harry.  They did not show their date to Hogs Meade and the film barely touched on their relationship with each other.

I understand that a nearly 3 hours movie is more then long enough to satisfy most movie goers, but the director seemed to not include some of the key things that happen to a young man at that age.  I think a romantic view of Harry would have been a great addition to this film.  If they were to cut out anything from this film that wasn't necessary, they should have cut out the scenes of the annoying reporter.  As you can tell from the movie they cut some of her part as well.

For those who haven't read the book, the reporter gets turned into a bug and is placed in a jar by Hermine, thus changing her ways.  Since this film failed to capture that ending of the reporter, I think they should have done away of her character for this film.

Another key part that was cut out was at the end Harry donates all of his winnings to the twins, which plays a key factor in the later books.  Overall this movie is a must see and for those who have read the book, don't get your hopes too high.  So far, I think the books are so much better then the movies.  BUT, it is really cool seeing what you pictured in your mind, as you are reading the book, to come out on to the big screen.  Great Movie overall, but a 4 for leaving out key things.",1147132800,,1927,4.026315789473684
2505448,4,B000E6EK3S,"The first film in the series to receive a PG-13 rating (instead of a PG), ""Goblet of Fire"" is definitely scarier than the first three (which were already scary to some extent), but it is also the best ""Harry Potter"" movie so far.  It is very rare for a film franchise to improve with each subsequent installment, but as any fan of the books can tell you, author J.K. Rowling's storytelling abilities are consistently strong, and the characters of both the books and the films are continuing to evolve and deepen, making them easily relatable to readers and audiences.  The now-teenaged actors who portray Harry, Ron, and Hermione have also improved in each film, and their performances in the new film are less amateurish than any of their previous ones.",1147046400,,754,4.792307692307692
2505449,4,B000E6EK3S,"I've been waiting a year and a half for this movie and I can tell you that it was Definitely worth the wait! Even though Daniel, Rupert and Emma are much older than 14 (it's pretty obvious) they are so convincing as they learn about their feelings of maturity.  The selection ceremony for the Tri-Wizard tournament was humorous. The look of shock on certain characters faces is unforgettable! The tasks are fun and exciting even though I already knew what was going to happen! I thought that the Yule ball was absolutely spectacular, and Ron's dress robes were awesome! The movie was so well done, I'd have to say that it is the best movie in the series so far!  For fans of the movies, you'll find this installment a little darker, a little grittier, and a little more involving. The characters are growing up and are now facing more adult situations with more adult outlooks.

It's unfortunate that so much of the book needed to be cut for time and the movie is still nearly 2 1/2 hours long.  A lot of story and character development isn't there.  But what there is is a great visual treat.  The special effects and the music in the this movie were the best yet! The underwater scenes especially were very well done.  This movie, like many, does have its shortfalls. I believe that Dumbledore was portrayed as a little too intense.  Instead of the benevolent, kind, and good-humored old man I have always loved in the books. As someone that has read the books, I must say another shortfall is that this movie banks on familiarity with the story. Having read the books, I found it very easy to follow, but I could understand how one who has not read the books may feel a bit lost, as some important information was left out and some back-story was left mostly unexplained.

All in all I would say this is definitely the best movie in this series so far, and if the next three are on par with this one then I would be content.",1146873600,,1927,4.451704545454546
2505450,5,B000E6EK3S,I am a huge fan of Harry Potter; the books and the movies. This film was no exception. I am tempted to say that it was the best movie yet.,1146787200,,138,3.6333333333333333
2505451,5,B000E6EK3S,"Mike Newell (""4 Weddings and a Funeral,"" ""Love Actually"") may have been an unexpected choice to direct Harry Potter film.  He's mastered the art of the British upper-crust romantic comedy, but anxious fans wondered how that would translate to Hogwarts, dragons, and the return of Lord Voldemort?

Fortunately for all, Newell was up to the challenge and has given us one of the most visually stunning movies this side of Peter Jackson.

You may have heard a slight rumor or the occasional hint that this movie does not treat J.K. Rowling's mammoth book as a shooting script.  This is true, and this was obviously the correct decision -- not even the most die-hard fan would sit still for the eight-hour movie that would have entailed.  It's not surprising to find fans frustrated with this movie because their favorite scenes (whether the dragon fight, or the big dance, or Harry's sojourn underwater, or Hagrid's romantic efforts) handled with a bit more economy than the book.

But if you look at the movie for what it is, then you have to give it a rave review.  From the Triwizard Tournament to Harry's fight with the dragon to Lord Voldemort's bilious return, this movie looks great and captures the essence of J.K. Rowling's wonderful story.  I'll leave it to others to summarize the plot, but suffice to say that Harry, Ron and Hermione have grown, as have their dangers and concerns.  This is easily the most grown-up movie so far, and be warned if you have younger kiddies who may have liked the first couple of movies.  Dark stuff lies ahead.

One scene stands out as one of the best extended special effects shots ever -- Harry's extended fight with the dragon is sure to turn up annually in those special effects montages that they fire off in the Academy Awards show just when everyone is getting ready to doze off.  Kudos all around!",1146441600,,1846,4.716510903426792
2505452,2,B000E6EK3S,"It's tough adapting wildly popular books for the screen.  The outsized ""Harry Potter"" books have proven especially vexing, provoking a tug of war between the letter of the law, and the spirit.  The first two films, directed by Chris Columbus, opted for the former, producing efforts long on exposition and short on character.  The third, directed by Alfonso Cuar?n, breathed fresh magic into the series, enriching the fantastic imagery and expanding the personalities of the characters.  Mr. Cuar?n passed on directing this installment, and we have a new freshman for the franchise - Mike Newell, the director of ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"".

Sadly, the invigorating effect of the third film hasn't passed on to ""Goblet"", and we've returned to exposition-land.  There was a good opportunity here to transform Rowling's unwieldly plot into a more streamlined vehicle.  Unfortunately, most of the bones have been jettisoned, and the fat retained instead.  We're left to watch two and a half hours of introductions, ceremonies and lengthy speeches.

Dozens of half-muttered asides are scattered about to explain the various potions, rules, and dignitaries that litter the plot.  It's hard to believe that it would make much sense, much less create a compelling tale, for the non-initiated.  We're drawn into a world-wide Quidditch match, only to be awkwardly shoved to the post-game festivites without seeing so much as a single play.  Aside from some athletic uniforms, who would know what that gargantuan meeting was for without reading the book?

This is all done with grand flourish, though the effect soon becomes deadening.  The Big Game.  The Bigger Dance.  The Biggest Game, and bigger and bigger and bigger still, though we have little sense what any of this means to the characters, or to the forces of darkness that lurk beneath all of these stories.  Human moments glimmer here and there as our heroes struggle with their budding emotions and self-awareness, but these are rare, buried in the pomp.  There are some standout action sequences, too - Harry's battle with a ferocious dragon is exciting, and the climax retains some of its emotional force, but for the most part the proceedings are fairly dull.

Until the filmmakers feel courageous enough to leave some of the imagery to the audience's imaginations, and return the focus to the identifiable, human elements of the stories, we're in for some dispiriting films indeed.",1146355200,,2440,5.147208121827411
2505453,2,B000E6EK3S,"Come on! The character development was terrible, and the cast poorly directed. All one has to do is compare this film to the previous one to know that is far under par",1146355200,,167,4.25
2505454,4,B000E6EK3S,"I am both an avid movie-goer AND Harry Potter reader.  As such, my reactions to the film are conflicted.

I agree with many of the other Harry Potter fans' comments:  the movie has a terrible screenplay.  For any movie-goer, whether he/she has read the book or not:  the plot is choppy, rushed, and without any kind of depth to character development or proper climax building.  The movie becomes very confusing and then flat, because if characters' actions and emotions are not thoroughly explained, one cannot sympathize with them.  I agree with blaming the director as well.  At times, he took too many liberties from the original text in order to create a 'movie experience,' but then at other times he relied on people having read the book to support an entire scene.  I think he had a hard time deciding who his main audience was going to be.  As a Harry Potter fan, one is of course especially disappointed, because this particular movie interpretation really misses out on the suspense, paranoia, and the multifold nature of Harry's internal anguish that are so vivid in the book.  Personally, I think 'The Sorcerer's Stone' was the most truthful interpretation and most well-rounded movie in itself.  But then, that was also the least complex book in the series, featuring a much younger Harry.  With each successive book, J.K Rowling has let Harry grow up by writing him in an increasingly introspective manner; and as her own writing has matured, her plotlines have gotten more complex...in all fairness, that is just going to become more and more difficult to translate to the screen--no matter how good the acting, directing, editing etc.  I am bracing myself apprehensively for 'The Order of the Phoenix' already....really don't know how they will pull that one off.....

But I am giving this movie a 4 anyway, because I agree 100% with the Academy Award nomination for Art Direction.  The special effects are amazing, and the recreation of the physical space as the setting for the story is very much true to what my imagination conjured up from the text.  The 'Goblet of Fire' contained multiple new magical settings/scenes:  the World Quidditch cup, the Dragon Challenge, the Black Lake, the Maze, Voldemort's and Harry's wand duel, even 'smaller' moments like Sirius speaking to Harry through the fire....the list goes on and on.  What they all have in common though is that each scene was beautifully interpretted and visually stunning.

It is for this achievement that I am going to go ahead and buy the special two-disc edition anyway (and so should you :-) ).  Even if I am disappointed with the story line, the film is truly a unique viewing pleasure.  See so for yourself!",1146268800,,2695,4.876923076923077
2505455,3,B000E6EK3S,"I truly hope that this director is not going to direct the next.  While the Goblet of Fire has it's moments, I felt rushed.  Too much time spent on  the ""important"" moments and not enough time spent on the wonder and texture that the Harry Potter story has.  Yes, yes, I realize that this is a movie and not the book (yada, yada, yada... save it!) It was still supposed to have been true to the texture, quality, storyline, and magic of Harry Potter and Rowling's writing.  There are moment's in the movie that are taken out of context and therefore make no sense. Only one example is that Ron is instantly ready to cut Harry out of his life after all their bonding and closeness.  The other main characters and the fine actors that play them are reduced to a passing reference. Michael Gambdon's portrayl of Dumbledore is even worse ( if that  is possible) than his first.  I wish he would read the  books.  He portrays Dumbledore as a bumbling, slobbery-mouthed victim of senility.  The movie could have been greatly helped by either adding at least 30 minutes to the movie or by dividing the movie into two parts (it would have been worth it.) The Harry Potter series has too large a following to fool around with the story this much.  The movie is choppy at best and left me with a feeling of being cheated because the public is so addicted to the stories that they will pay their money anyway regardless of the swill that is passed out for a movie.  A collection of a couple of good scenes and no story.  I wanted to see a good movie based on a good book and not a photo gallery. The kids are getting better and better as actors - but not enough to save the movie. I think the public has  shown that it will spend extra time to watch a good movie - why not the Harry Potter movies?",1146182400,,1786,4.28955223880597

Some beautiful sets and special effects, IMO overall good acting, except in the beginning, when I almost gagged on the phony emotional histrionics (I wonder what was going on at the set). What I am giving this bomb a 1 star rating for is the cliche ridden script, does Harry Potter become an ostracized object of scorn and then vindicated into a hero in every story? The direction as another reviewer stated felt rushed and, I suspect, undecipherable unless you have read the novels. Stay away if you are looking for a good film. The first one, while not a classic, was a novelty and entertaining, and the second and third weren't bad, although the repetition starts in the second movie. After it was over, I wondered if I would have watched it knowing how dull it was going to be (except for a few minutes-even the dragon segments were ""okay, I know where this is going"") and I voted no, I would not have watched it.",1146009600,,1005,4.467391304347826
2505467,3,B000E6EK3S,"I agree with the previous reviewer.  Prisoner of Azkaban, in my opinion was the best book in the Harry Potter series and the POA movie was the best one in the series so far. The POA movie was magical(sic) and stunning.  Michael Cuaron was great at handling the difficult ""Time Travel"" concept and made the movie extremely enjoyable.

Goblet of Fire on the other hand looks like an express train only intent on arriving at its destination with no time for passing sceneries.  Everything except the Yule ball and the tournaments are a fast blur and I particularly felt the rushed script kind of took away the essence of the movie. Snape, Draco, Sirius and even Skeeter are just for scene fillers with nothing much to do.  Gambon is unconvincing as Dumbledore. I feel that the director could have handled the movie more creatively.

The story has been condensed and reworked to make it fit into the alloted time span, but it doesn't lose too much in the process. Goblet of Fire was never the best of the Harry Potter books, but the movie version might benefit from a Peter Jackson style extended edition with some of the sub-plots from the novel included. That said, the movie was dark and exciting. The challenges were thrilling, especially the dragon fight, and Mad-Eye Moody stole every scene he was in. Teenage relationships are nicely observed, especially considering the fantasy surroundings, and one thing this film does well is to show that Harry and his friends are just as human as the muggles watching them.",1145750400,,803,4.784172661870503

In this installment the director, Mike Newell chose to zero in on the boarding school/teen angst stuff and I think that was a good choice.

In the previous films magic was still very new to Harry and he was reacting to it as anyone would when faced with something totally unfamiliar. The first three films story lines were very specific, in the first Harry is in search of The Sorcerers Stone, in the second he is trying to figure out who wants into The Chamber of Secrets, and in the third film we meet The Prisoner of Azkaban. Now, Harry is fourteen and along with the constant threat of Voldemort's return to power, Harry is also going through something very real, puberty. Harry is interested in girls, Cho Chang specifically. There is a scene early in this film when Harry says ""I love magic,"" and he does, but if this film were all about the magic, that just wouldn't be very honest. Performances are solid, story is strong and affecting, special effects are brilliant.",1145664000,,1159,4.545454545454546

I am a BIG fan of the book series and have slowly become a moderate fan of the movie series. Obviously the movies cannot compare to the books in quality and especially not quanity , and I think there lies one of this movies' faults. I felt that for one who had not read the novels it would be a little hard to follow. Althrough showing the young death-eater early did help as did simplifying the plot line(i.e Cutting the Harry's stay with Durseley's, and the World Cup, etc.)

  (Spoiler paragragh )

As usual the settings were beautiful and I thought the sound quality was good as well. The entrances of the other schools were entertaning. Moody's eye was a disapointment, but besides that Moody was a nice addition to the cast. Dumbledore's violence was the only thing that ruined the Goblet of Fire scene. The Yule Ball really let me down because I wanted to see some dress robes on someone besides Ron. Hermione didn't change that much and when she first comes down the steps it looks like she has wings, which gave me a laugh. The second task was done very well. The Third Task had no creatures and the only thing the champions had to fight were eachother and the maze. The scene in the grave yard was my favorite scene in the movie, but I was distracted by Voldemort's lack of nose. The wrapup was a fitting end to the story.

(End Spoiler Paragraph)

  So looking at this movie on its own it is a good addition to the Harry Potter franchise settling in the second spot close behind the Prisoner of Azkaban. It will be hard to follow the story if you are not familiar with the basic plotline.

2505472,4,B000E6EK3S,"The Harry Potter film franchise takes off with another wizardly tale of growing up at Hogwarts with all of its interpersonal banter and dark underpinnings.

Watching the young actors age on the screen is probably becoming one of the more satisfying things for me. It makes it seem more ""real"" even though this is just a fantastic fantasy.

Coming back to the wizard school this time, we see that Ron, Hermione and Harry have hit their growth (and hormone) spurts. Dancing, love, friendship, and danger are now forever linked as we're introduced to the Goblet of Fire TriWizard competition. Normally set as a triad competition (between three individuals of different schools) this time there will be four contestants, obviously including Harry. Angst and anger are the melange of the day as Harry has to deal with his lack of knowledge about the competition and grapple with his growing affection for girls his own age. Oh yes, and he's still be chased by the evil Lord Voldemort (the wizard responsible for his parents' death and the unusual scar forever emblazoned on Harry's forehead).

Harry's not old enough to compete in the competition and his fellow Hogwartians aren't happy with the fact that Harry seems to be outgrowing his own shoes. Is he too cocky? Harry never entered the competition and doesn't know how his name got picked but his fellow classmates don't believe him.

As the Goblet of Fire contest continues, we see Harry battling dragons, saving one friend but unable to rescue another, and then meeting face-to-face with true evil.

Perhaps it's the dark qualities of these latest Potter films that drags me in, or perhaps I'm just a fan of the genre (junky?), but whatever it is, I find the dangers and limited successes of Harry and his friends comforting and realistic (not overly done with a ""Mr. Goody-Two-Shoes"" attitude). This one's rated PG-13, too, so keep an eye on the kiddies.

Like the Prizoner of Azkaban, this one has very dark over and undertones. And clocking in at two-and-a-half hours, it's one of the longer in the series but well worth the sitting time.",1145664000,,2093,4.865168539325842

I didn't see GOF in the theatre, but I bought the DVD anyway thinking it would be of equal quality. It is not. The writing competes with the direction for the title of bad.

I found the DVD a sympathetic and incisive version of the heart of the book.  Of course, a lot that was in the book was omitted from the DVD, as you would expect.  It is definitely worth buying the book as well, but for sheer spectacle and visual experience, this was great entertainment!

Having said that, in my opinion, the maze was disappointing... an anticlimax after the dragons, and the merpeople, when surely the third task should have been the most dramatic of all, but how dire and dramatic can one make hedges?

The privet could have taken lessons from the Whomping Willow.

Possibly this movie did not make the best use of the abundant talent on the regular cast.  While I did not miss Dobby in the least, I would have liked to see more of Severus Snape, Minerva, Arthur Weasley, Sirius, Lucius Malfoy, Draco Malfoy, Madam Sprout, and Miss Trelawney.

Did classes take place?  If they did, they were not memorable, unlike the Cornish pixies lesson, or the dueling club, or the lesson where Minerva shapeshifted from a cat, or the lesson about Boggarts.

I have only praise for the quality of the acting for both starring and supporting parts, even though I thought so many new characters were given disproportionate screen  time.

My copy of the DVD had technical quality problems.  Half way through the movie, the DVD cut off, defaulted to an earlier scene, and would not play on until we thought to use the scene-by-scene function.  I hope this is an individual problem, or --if not-- that my mention of a temporary fix will help other viewers.

I have exchanged this flawed copy for a perfect version, and plan to watch it again.  I love it when either a book or a movie has elements I don't notice the first time around.  I'm sure Harry Potter and The Goblet of Fire will delight me repeatedly.

i was left with an impression that the original cut of the movie was 10 hours long and then the director had to shorten it to mere 2.5. as a consequence, the movie is anything but smooth. most of the time it is dominated by short sequences without any connection one to another. on the other hand, there is some lenghty sequences that are plain boring and from the point of main storyline - redundant [for example, harry potter vs the dragon, the ball, triwizard schools arrival - i had to use ffd button to go through them]. i understand that comparing with previous potter movies the original book was twice thicker - but this is all the reason to make a really careful selection of the material - what to enhance, what to skip. maybe dividing the book into two parts or risking launching one 4 hours-long movie could help. as it is - it is dismal.

if the cut is terrible, the acting is no better. all adult characters behave like something between village idiots and cheap magicians [dumbledore yells all the time without a reason, crouch senior [what purpose does he serve?] is acting as if he were performing some tricks for kids, voldemort appears to be more of a naughty boy than evil lord of power], all teenage characters are plain and dull. the sense of drama is missing - and the movie feels cheap. as if after paying foreground actors there were no money left for a decent scenario editing, director with a clear vision and skill, good quality computer editing/ special effects. shame to waste a nice story.",1145318400,,1847,4.526946107784431
2505496,2,B000E6EK3S,"Lets face it. Targeted primarily at children, the Harry Potter series has been an effective tool for promoting negative messages and glamorizing witchcraft. The earlier movies hooked millions of children around the world with images of cute kids, cuddly animals, and seemingly innocent, even humorous, so-called magic, while these later movies now introduce those same children to far more sinister messages and imagery.

What are only a few of the negative messages promoted so far? Adults, in any position (parent, teacher, guardian), are not to be respected or obeyed. Rules are to be broken (the three leading characters break just about every rule and are often rewarded for it). A real education is not needed (no reading, writing, or math classes or teachers at this so-called ""school""). It is acceptable to assault those one doesn't like (Ron hits a teacher on the head in the second movie, Harry terrorizes a female relative in the third movie, Hermione slugs another student while being teased, and so on). Witchcraft, which can be bad, is generally good. Those who believe in witchcraft are generally good. Those who are not witches (so called ""Muggles""), or don't believe in witchcraft, are nearly always bad (very few scenes of a ""good Muggle"" in the entire series - the little girl, Hermione, even cries about her ""Muggle"" parents in the second movie). The witchcraft (poisons and so on) these children are learning can be used to threaten, control, torture, and kill.

This last movie, Goblet of Fire, should be enough to leave a bad taste in any sane person's mouth. Images of skulls, bones, and blood are commonplace. Evil characters, from talking snakes to skull-faced demons, are equally so. Violence (curses, threats, injuries, destruction, and death), and evidence of violence (fires, cuts, scratches, bruises, and blood), are seen throughout the movie. Two of the three deaths in the movie, the caretaker in the opening scenes and the young girl consumed by the plant in the maze, are glossed over without even a passing note.

The sexual content (Ron verbally admiring the buttocks of young ladies, the camera focusing on those young ladies' buttocks, a boy placing his hand down the front of another boys trousers, the child Hermione dating a young man obviously much older, Hagrid's hand on a woman's buttocks while children are around, and so on) is entirely inapropriate for the age group this movie series targets.

All in all, any prudent adult would be foolish to allow children, of any age, to watch these Harry Potter movies (any of the movies). And adults watching movies obviously designed for children should grow up. Those responsible for these movies (owners, producers, actors, writers, and J.K. Rowling), knowing many millions of children are watching, should be ashamed. While these movies are indeed fantasy, they clearly promote negative messages and glamorize witchcraft - which far too often has led to real human sacrifice (shown in these movies - Ron's sister in the second movie, for example), the use of poison (repeatedly mentioned in these movies), and more.",1145318400,,3108,5.100196463654224
2505497,1,B000E6EK3S,"GOBLET OF FIRE, as a book, was abysmal.  Just awful! Easily the bloodiest of all of the Harry Potter series, GOBLET... boasted dismemberment, gore and death, all of which were transferred to the movie version.  It's easy to forget that supposedly these books are supposed to be for fun. The book's plot, or lack thereof, was even scarier than the violence!

But the storyline was the very least of my worries with this movie.  The story is made even worse by the haphazard, on-again-off-again approach employed by the moviemakers in bringing it to the screen.  Just blink and you'll think that an entirely different plot has stolen the screen.  The film has absolutely no flow or transition. Jumpy and disjointed is the best that I can say about it.

Add to that some of the silliest scenes to ever grace the big screen.  First, there's Emma Watson's ""Cinderella on the Stairs"" scene.  Just about as schmaltzy as it gets.  Then there's Robbie Coltrane's nonsense as a lovesick Hagrid, courting a giantess who is at Hogwarts to chaperone team members from an all girl's school. And some of the dialog between Harry and Ron is so overpowered by their thick British dialects that subtitles might have helped.

And to make things even worse, the acting just gets worse and worse.  A wonderfully wicked cameo by Ralph Fiennes has some redeeming value.  For that the movie gets my single star. Don't even get me started about the main characters.

2505498,3,B000E6EK3S,"OK, I'm one of those fans who has read all of the books, and this one is my favorite. I know the book is 700+ pages, so they had to edit some of the content. Some of the parts in the movie I think should've been changed:

I thought that the Quidditch World cup scene should have been longer.

The scene where Harry battles the Hungarian Horntail is way too long.

They should have explained why Neville Longbottom was so upset when Moody used the Cruciatus Curse.

Shown that Rita Skeeter was really an Animagus.

Sirius had too small of a role.

And, last but not least, why is Dumbledore so mean? He's suppose to be very kind, and in this movie he comes across too harsh!

Now, onto the good parts...

The scene when Harry faces Voldemort is perfect. That was brilliantly done.

The casting of all of the new characters was great. They looked like I pictured them while reading the book, especially Rita Skeeter.

The Weasley twins were great too, I just wished they would've focused on their joke shop more. And this brings me to the question, of how come they never show Harry winning the money for the tournament, and giving it to the twins to open the shop?

Don't get me wrong, I think for being such a large book, they did the best job possible translating it to the big screen, and if you haven't read the book, you will thoroughly enjoy the story.",1145145600,,1357,4.366533864541832
2505499,5,B000E6EK3S,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire  is out on DVD, and it is indeed a magickal adventure! It's darker, more ominous, and contains more substance even than the previous films in the series. Definitely a tad too scary and deep for the younger viewers.

Adolescence is never easy. But it's proving especially rough for young wizard Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe).  First, the Quiddich World Cup Tournament is attacked by Dark Wizards. Then Harry's chosen as one of Hogwarts' two contestants in the TriWizard Tournament. And maybe scariest of all for a young man of Harry's age  - he has to invite a girl to his first formal dance at Hogwarts.

All this is enough for one young man to handle to begin with, without Dark Wizards in the minions of  ""He Who Must Not Be Named"" plotting his demise. And something's also a little ""off"" with the new Dark Arts teacher - Alastor ""Mad Eye"" Moody (Brendan Gleeson) - as well.

The main theme is the TriWizard Tournament. Hogwarts is hosting, and teams arrive from two other schools of Wizardry to compete in a series of magical contests, ones that are potentially life-threatening. There is an age limit in place for entrants, and Harry doesn't even attempt to enter. The Goblet of Fire is where names are to be placed for consideration. But his name is one of the ones chosen regardless. These trials include encounters with dragons, sirens, and a deadly maze that leads straight to Voldemort himself!

There are spectacular FX throughout! Albeit ominous, it's still visually stunning.

This DVD is jam-packed with bonus features, too! There are additional scenes, conversations with the cast, an in-depth look at the preparations for the Yule Ball, and more fun stuff like the TriWizard Tournament: Dragon Arena (with a draon challenge, meeting the champions, and Harry vs. the Horntail: The First Task), the TriWizard Tournament: Lake (with two challenges),  and the TriWizard Tournament: Maze with four challenges, including coming face to face with <gasp!> He Who Must Not Be Named. If all that's not enough? Take the disc out of the DVD player and throw it into the computer - there's a PC-DVD-ROM  drive for an EA game demo AND a Hogwarts timeline! Is that just too fun or what?! - The Crowgrrl",1145059200,,2240,4.822454308093994
2505500,5,B000E6EK3S,"Based on one of the best books of the Harry Potter series, the film adaptation of 'Harry Potter and the Goblet' had a lot to live up to and I think it succeeded. As Potter fans will know, in GoF, Harry is now fourteen and in his Fourth Year at Hogwarts. When an ancient tournament between Hogwarts and two other European wizarding schools is held that year, a Seventh Year contestant is chosen from each school to compete but things go dramatically awry when Harry, three years too young to even be entered in the dangerous and challenging tournament, is somehow also chosen after his name is mysteriously nominated. G.o. F. is a sharp turning point in the books as the tone darkens considerably and the characters themselves change from being rather wide-eyed innocent children to adolescents thrust the turbulent, uncertain adult world where being 'good' or even an innocent will not guarantee your survival. This shift is also reflected in the film, which was rated 12A (PG13 for Americans), the first of the HP films to be rated so high.

I thoroughly enjoyed this film. Unlike the first two films, this did not attempt to condescend as much to small children in the audience. It was as if Steve Kloves, the scriptwriter, finally realised the bulk of the audience were teenagers and adults and that is who he should be aiming the film at. The tasks of the Triwizard tournament captured most of the thrills of the book, particularly the second water-based task where the merpeople were suitably creepy (now we know why none of the kids go swimming in the summer term!), and, although the light romance was touched upon, it wasn't over-emphasised unlike other films which assume just because the script involves teenagers then there should be plenty of stereotypical focus on teen love and the like. The Yule Ball will please those who enjoyed the scenes in the book but audience members over the age of sixteen might find teens ogling each other a tad dull (Hermione is very out-of-character and the scene does drag a little).

The acting of the adult cast is, of course, exemplary as always. Alan Rickman's Snape may only have had four or so scenes but he definitely made his presences known while Maggie Smith really captured the essence of McGonagall. Many people do miss Richard Harris' Dumbledore but I found that Michael Gambon has done an excellent job of moulding the role to make it his own. In GoF, Dumbledore feels very human in the way he carries the weight of the wizarding world on his shoulders and though he struggles at times, his concern for his pupils is paramount. I finally felt the close rapport between Dumbledore and Harry in this film that was missing in the previous three HP flicks. However, the prize has to go to Brendan Gleeson for his scene-stealing depiction of Mad-Eye Moody. Gleeson clearly enjoyed illustrating Moody's dangerous, feral edge.

The younger cast have also grown into their roles, improving from their previous outing. Rupert Grint, usually used to playing a comical and stupid Ron, had the chance to cut his acting teeth and show Ron's darker, bitter side and he did well. The Phelp twins have also improved dramatically. No longer do they come across as wooden cut-outs just reading from a cue-card and instead they are able to show the mischievous spontaneity of the Weasley twins. And I look forward to seeing more of Matthew Lewis, who was great at showing Neville's sensitive side without making him too klutzy. Out of the younger cast, though, Dan Radcliffe is the one who has progressed the most. In PoA, he was awful in the 'he was their friend' scene so he seems like another boy in the harrowing graveyard scene and the aftermath, depicting Harry's anger, feelings of vulnerability and grief. He still stumbled on occasion in other scenes but I, at last, have faith he will be able to do the Harry of 'Order of the Phoenix' justice when the time comes.

Nevertheless, the film did lose some points on a few issues. Although most of the young cast have expanded their acting skills as they have gone on, Emma Watson is waning. She has a tendency of over-enunciating her lines and being too melodramatic, which worked in 'The Philosopher's Stone' when Hermione was condescending and childishly bossy, but is annoying by this point. She spent most of the film sounding as if she was on the verge of tears, even in scenes which were not remotely sad or upsetting. There was also a choppy feel to the film, as if Kloves struggled to properly condense the book into a two-hour film. Those who haven't read the books will have missed quite a bit and those who have read the books will feel the film is very rushed. Molly Weasley and the Dursleys were also missed, especially since I think Julie Walters would have been exceptional in the Molly/Harry interactions that take place aftermath of the graveyard scenes of the novel.

I think most Potter fans will enjoy this although they will remark that it could have been better. Non-fans will also get something from this film as I imagine it is hard not to be captivated by the many action and dramatic events but they may find themselves muddled by the story. I would recommend that parents of young children either keep away or, at the very least, check out the film firstly before deciding if their child is old enough to cope with it. When I went to see it, there was a small lad of four or five being dragged along and in the middle of a particularly fearsome incident, the silence of the moment was cut by a wee voice crying, 'Mummy, I'm scared' so, parents, be warned.",1144800000,,5579,4.694586312563841
2505501,4,B000E6EK3S,The story is nicely made which attracted lots of youngsters to view in Singapore theatre. One of the good collection for the young. The book author has shown her best of work to come out good story for the film. One of the good work shown.....,1144800000,,243,4.304347826086956
2505502,3,B000E6EK3S,"I have severely mixed feelings about this movie. It was good cinematically, with amazing special effects and great acting. But it basically skipped from main event to main event, not explaining the few bits it kept in (Rita Skeeter, Neville's heartbreaking story, etc.) It seemed VERY rushed-through.

For instance, there was the case of Sirius Black. (If I sound biased, he IS my favorite character...) It gave the impression of ""the entire last movie was about him, but instead of giving him decent screen time, we'll cram him into a (very odd and much different from the book) fireplace scene"". I'm not slighting Gary Oldman, as usual, his performance as everyone's favorite ex-Azkaban convict was brilliant. It was the amount of screen time that bugged me. (Plus, it's absolutely against his character to think he'd not be there right after Harry's horrific experience in the graveyard. Heck, AZKABAN couldn't even keep him from helping his godson!)

Neville was acted spectacularly by Matthew Lewis, but his parental trauma was barely explained and it was never fully communicated to you the reason Fake Moody was so gleeful at Neville's reaction to the Cruciatus Curse -- he himself had participated in the torture of Frank and Alice Longbottom. And again, Brendan Gleeson was great, except for that stupid eye. I always pictured it as a huge, slimy, moving eye, not a pirate's eye patch, but hey, that's just me.

So, all in all, it was a good movie, but it could have been so much better. I'm praying they don't mess up my favorite book of the series in the movie adaptation: Order of the Phoenix.

2505513,4,B000E6EK3S,"I'll start by saying that I loved this movie.  So, why four stars?

There was quite a bit left out that was in the book.  While I understand that material had to be left out due to the length, it was a shame to have cut out S.P.E.W.!

Also, while the actor who played Voldemort is very good and fit the role, I would have prefered to see Rowan Atkinson as Voldemort.  (There was a rumor going around that he had been cast in the role, and I think he would have brought so much more to it.)

Other than those small issues though, they did a wonderful job with the fourth Harry Potter installment.  I can hardly wait for ""Order of the Phoenix!""",1144713600,,642,4.129032258064516
2505514,5,B000E6EK3S,"The book is always better than the movie, but looking at them as stand alone, #3 was a great movie and this one is even better.  great special effects, funny, and pretty suspenseful at a lot of times.  (the twins dying to get away from the guys at the ball kills me.)  The chopped story should bother any rational person who realizes that movies cannot follow books.  Doesn't work.  However, the style of the characters can be translated acceptably, and in occasional instances, done perfectly.  (Gandalf in FOTR, Marv in Sin City).  However, in the Potter movies, Dumbledore has become a big issue.  I think that he is by far the most compelling and exciting character in the books, and the movies (probably more Gambon. Seems like a jerk in real life) are turning him into a very shallow, mundane teacher, instead of the unbelievably clever and powerful dude he is in the book.  Also, call wardrobe for the next movie and get the guy some robes; and out of that dress!  Does anyone who reads the books imagine A.D. having to hitch up his slip every time he wants to take a step?  (Also, Long White Beard and Hair, not Harley Davidson's Granddad.  Jeez)

As usual, great visual effects. I loved the entry of the two rival schools.  Sorry, I now know that they aren't private schools for boys or girls, but it was very entertaining the way it was presented...and isn't that the final point?

It was also interesting how the characters have grown up and are recognizing their hormones.  OMG I felt really, REALLY, uncomfortable when Harry and Ron were sitting with their ""dates"" at the ball.

2505516,1,B000E6EK3S,"A rabid Harry Potter fan, I've never liked the film adaptations of the books (with the possible exception of PoA) as they've never really been true to the storyline of the novels or to the characters. Yes I understand that quite a few things must be cut out, but it was never done neatly, and the story never really held together.

The Goblet of Fire film adaptation follows in that tradition. The movie felt like scenes and snapshots randomly thrown together, there was no real sense of continuity - this may have been partly due to the fact that each scene lasted about 5 seconds. You get this impression that the storyline is being squeezed in, that they were just rushing through scenes as if they wanted to get through them quickly without taking up too much reel space or something.

The Quidditch World Cup?! They totally skipped it. One moment you have the audience waiting in anticipation as the announcer (no Ludo Bagman) speaks, then the players fly in...and then cut to Harry, Hermione and the Weasleys celebrating Ireland's victory back in their tent (just one tent in the movie). That was so unbelievably disappointing, even though I didn't like the way they filmed the Quidditch matches in previous films (all that fouling seemed condoned).

The arrival of the Beauxbatons and Durmstrang students is weirdly dramatic - it seems all the Beauxbatons students are girls (WRONG, try again - Rowling specifically mentions male Beauxbatons students in the books) and all the Durmstrang students boys (oops wrong again - a Durmstrang girl is in fact mentioned in the books). Then it seems that all of the Beauxbatons girls are as beautiful and fairy-like as veela, and the Durmstrang boys put on this odd martial arts display.

Then the Goblet of Fire scene, when the champions are announced...WHAT was Michael Gambon thinking? First of all, I've always disliked that ponytail beard of his, and I never liked his portrayal of Dumbledore too much. In this film there's this astonishing scene in which Dumbledore shakes Harry and shouts at him, demanding if he put his name in the Goblet. Does this ring true to Dumbledore's character to anyone? I was appalled; Dumbledore doesn't lose his temper when he's about to be murdered for God's sake, and they want him to start screaming when Harry breaks school rules? Later at the Leaving Feast, Dumbledore says a little speech in Cedric's honor, completely lacking in force or emotion of any kind, as if he's merely reciting his lines and then adding some gestures as an afterthought. There's none of Rowling's powerful language and drama and suspense in this film. None of it.

The Goblet of Fire plotline was massacred. I know the storyline is extremely complex, but it IS manageable! Didn't Peter Jackson prove that when he adapted the LOTR trilogy so brilliantly? He did miss out some sections, but he pulled the story together so perfectly that in the end he really did justice to the novels. There was no backstory whatsoever about the two Crouch men, no explanation of motives, and when Neville starts shaking in DADA class it makes you think they'll explain why, because otherwise his behaviour would be baffling to the audience (those who haven't read the books). No, there's no explanation. In the trial scene in the Pensieve (two scenes condensed to one, but that's perfectly understandable), there's only one reference to Frank and Alice Longbottom, and you won't catch it unless you know the story already.

Voldemort...I felt embarrassed. He is the most unimpressive fantasy villain ever depicted on screen (I haven't seen the Narnia movie so that isn't included in the comparison). Ralph Fiennes is a great actor, but he was completely out of his element in this role. Voldemort, like Dumbledore, lacked any real stage presence or force of character, and Fiennes employed dramatic poses and gestures that looked completely idiotic. When Voldemort started melodramatically leaping about the graveyard and yelling, I started laughing. The direction was the biggest problem I think - I've seen Fiennes in other movies, and he's talented. Admittedly Voldemort is a tough character for anyone to portray, but then so is Saruman, and Christopher Lee nailed him in that performance. Both Lee and director Jackson were LOTR fans, so I assume they took a lot of trouble understanding the characters. In any case, Voldemort was even more disappointing than Dumbledore. Moody was also carelessly portrayed, and they hardly took the trouble to make his eye look like a real one, instead strapping some pirate-style thing over his forehead to attach to his eye.

The only time I felt anything at all was when Harry returned with Cedric's body and Amos Diggory said ""My son!"" - I admit I did get a bit teary-eyed then. Cedric Diggory, Cho Chang and Viktor Krum were good, Fleur a bit too dull; I had imagined a sparkling young person with icy indifference to people around her, but never dull or boring, or lacking in vitality.

On a related note, Hermione is becoming way too pretty. Hollywood is such a sell-out; they're so obsessed with having everyone look good in movies they disregard the fact that, in this film at least, some characters aren't supposed to look like movie stars. Hermione was great in the first two movies, but she's becoming more and more lacquered and doll-like. They've made her hair fall in these beautiful ringlets rather than made it look unkempt and bushy - which is how it's supposed to look. I honestly wasn't so shocked when i saw her at the Yule Ball, because she looks like that in all of the shots in the movie. It's the same with Harry - the first thing I ever noticed abt him in the first movie was that his hair was all neatly combed. And Ron's character was once again sidelined - he's never given the same prominence and respect that the novels give him.

All in all, a predictable massacre of the Harry Potter world. Hollywood evidently has the money to create the perfect sets, but the producers, writers and directors involved in these movies so far clearly don't have the vision. Maybe if they had commissioned J K Rowling to write the screenplay it would have been a few million times better. Unfortunately for all of us, they just didn't.",1144713600,,6239,4.839737582005624
2505517,4,B000E6EK3S,"I've graded this as if this were the O.W.L. exam.

Although my heart would really love to see a direct adaptation of the books played out by these wonderful, immensely talented actors; I realize that it would have had to be approximately 8 hours long to do so.  That being said, I fully expected some large cuts from the storyline to be made.  There were.  I do not feel that they detracted from the storyline.  There are some things I wish had been explained, as in the background story of the 4 marauders (this was left out also in movie 3)

This being my favorite of the novels so far, I was highly anxious to see the treatment of the story, and the acting behind it.  The only character who I was disappointed by was Hermione.  She has always been bossy and overbearing, highly intelligent and ""a fierce, fierce friend"" to Harry and Ron.  Although Emma Watson did an excellent job portraying the screenplay as written, I believe the director has turned her into a silly, shallow girl who just cries all the time.  She has really lost her integrity in this one.

Dumbledore (Gambon) is really growing on me.  I am beginning to really understand his take on the character.  I have heard people criticizing how rough he was with Harry when he was asking whether Harry had put his name into the goblet, but I liked it.  No, I didn't like the imagry of an old, strong man being violent towards a young boy, but I did like how uspet he was.  One thing about the way that Richard Harris played Dumbledore is that he was too ""gentle"" with him when Harry risked his life.  I think what Michael Gambon is trying to portray is a man who has put in countless hours and endless effort trying to do everything he can to keep Harry safe from harm.  He is a substitute parent for Harry, and loves him like a son.  When it looks like Harry has done something infintely stupid to risk his life, Dumbledore is obviously very upset.  As any parent would be, if their child did the same thing.

Ray Finnes (sp?) did a fantastic job of portraying Voldemort.  His quicksilver mood changes from almost funny to horrifyingy angry just make him all the more dangerous, as there is no way to predict how he will react to something.  He is truly believable as the most evil wizard ever.

This movie, however, has completely lost the integrity of the three main characters. All Hermione does is look cute and cry a lot, which is so wrong I just wanna throw up. Ron is comic relief, and Harry's just a mixed up teenager. They're just turning Harry Potter into another Hollywood action film with typical good-looking teenaged leads. The reason I give it 2 or 3 stars is because the acting is very good (the three kids have actually improved their acting over the years, even though their characterizations are faltering). Voldemort and Mad-Eye Moody are well acted, and of course so are Hagrid, Snape, McGonagal, etc. The special effects are also incredible.

Director Mike Newell has put his own stamp on this movies.  He has cut excess characters and inessential subplots and focussed on the main characters.

2505544,5,B000E6EK3S,"""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"", the much anticipated fourth installment of J.K. Rowling's tale of the boy wizard finally hit theaters in November.  With its darker theme, the movie was the first of the Harry Potter movies to receive a PG-13 rating.

This time around Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is faced with a number of obstacles.  From the beginning, Harry has dreams of Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) who seems to be planning a way to get rid of him.  Harry also finds himself falling for Cho Chang (Katie Leung), a fellow Hogwarts student.  However, the biggest event that Harry has to face is the Triwizard Tournament.

Hogwarts plays host to Durmstrang with their headmaster Karkaroff (Predrag Bjelac) and Beauxbatons with headmistress Madame Maxime (Frances de la Tour).  The names of candidates are placed in an old, impartial goblet which chooses a champion from each school.  The goblet produces the names of Viktor Krum (Stanislav Ianevski) from Durmstrang, Fleur Delacour (Clemence Poesy) from Beauxbatons and Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson) from Hogwarts.  Everyone is shocked when a fourth name is thrown out:  Harry Potter.

Since each champion is required to compete, there is no backing out for Harry who must face three grueling tasks: recover a golden egg that's being guarded by a dragon, recover ""something precious that has been stolen"" which has been placed in the lake and finding the tournament trophy in a massive maze.  Although the tasks are daunting, Harry seems to find an ally in Mad-Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.  Will Harry win the Triwizard Tournament?  How does Voldemort play into all this?  You'll have to watch ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" to find out!

This is another movie where I've heard pros and cons about so I ended up seeing this one twice just to form my own opinion.  The book itself is several hundred pages long while the movie is around two and a half hours so some things had to be edited out or not filmed at all.  The movie covered the major points of the book which should lead to a smooth transition to the next film, for the most part.

The three tasks of the Triwizard Tournament were exciting; especially the chase scene in the first task between Harry and the dragon.  The underwater sequences were fun and the maze sequence was a bit spooky.  Another highlight was the graveyard scene.  (In case you haven't seen it, I won't spoil it!)  I also thought the Dark Mark effect that was shown several times was good.

The cast has to be one of the main reasons the films are successful.  Brendan Gleeson was an excellent addition as the slightly crazed Mad-Eye Moody.  He, along with George and Fred Weasley (Oliver and James Phelps) brought some comedic relief to the film as does Snape (Alan Rickman) in a scene with Ron (Rupert Grint), Hermione (Emma Watson) and Harry in class.  It was also good to see more of Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) in this film (she seemed underutilized in the last one) as well as Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) beginning to break out of his shell.

One of the major debates that some movie fans have been having is Michael Gambon's (angrier/emotional) portrayal of Dumbledore in the new film.  I tend to be one of those who liked this performance for two reasons:  he knew, for once, he couldn't protect Harry and I think it shows that he has what it takes to take on Voldemort in the next movie.

There were a couple of things that I thought could have been better about the film.  Rita Skeeter (Miranda Richardson) was barely used in the movie so we don't get to see just how much of a nuisance she was to Harry and Hermione.  We also don't get to know too much about Barty Crouch Jr.'s (David Tennant) background.  Also, while Dumbledore does give a closing speech regarding the events that have happened, I thought it would have been a little better if the movie would have touched on the impending ""war"" with Voldemort and the problems with the Ministry of Magic.  I believe (if memory serves me right) at the end of the book he sent out Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) and Snape on separate missions while contacting some of his allies who'll eventually be the ""Order of the Phoenix"".

""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is a good continuation of the story.  It shows that things are changing and signals the darker times to come.",1144281600,,4387,4.717477003942181
2505545,5,B000E6EK3S,"It's about time. No longer did the filmmakers feel the need to tone down some of the scarier moments and themes. Finally, we have a HP movie that (at least somewhat closely,) captures the darkness, as well as humor, of the book. Prisoner of Azkaban made an effort to do this, but Goblet of Fire succedes fully.

Goblet of Fire is paced very well. It takes off almost instantly and the pacing rarely lets up. But unlike Prisoner of Azkaban, where important plot points were sped through (to the confusion of non-readers,) Goblet of Fire at least makes sure most loose ends are tied up. From the beginning, the movie seems epic. The music, by Patrick Doyle, is great, and, in my opinion, and improvement on John Williams's music. The music when they ride the portkey is excellent, for example, and Doyle's new HP theme, (that plays a couple of times during the movie, most notably when Harry sees the ghosts of his parents,) is excellent. Williams fans don't need to worry, though; his HP theme remains in the opening scene and at the start of the credits.

Special effects have improved all around, and some scenes, like the Quidditch World Cup, the Portkey scene, the 2nd task, Priori Incantatem....these scenes are amazing. And after basically having had his character ruined in Prisoner of Azkaban, Ron is FINALLY more than just ""comic relief."" And Rupert Grint shows that he can actually act, rather than the mugging for the camera he did in the past 2 movies. Dan Radcliffe's performance as Harry has also improved, and while there's still some occasional issues, overall, he's completely captured the essence of the character. Emma Watson as Hermione....she's good in some scenes more than others. At times, she seemed to be overacting a little bit. Yet, in other scenes she did a great job. It's really hard to say for sure. Hopefully her performance will be a bit more even in Order of the Phoenix.

I'm also glad to see that they didn't squeeze a happy ending out of this movie. Yeah, the ending's still slightly more happy than the book's, but it's more of an ""uplifting"" happy than the ""cheesy"" happy that was used in the previous 2 movies. I said this with Prisoner of Azkaban, and I guess I'm saying it again with Goblet of Fire; the HP series is heading in the right direction. Can't wait for Order of the Phoenix.

My only problems with this movie are minor. Dumbledore's personality....I didn't have as much of a problem as most people apparently did, but the scene in the trophy room was way over the top. Dumbledore even looked INSANE in some shots. (Look at his face in the close-up after Moody explains that ""The goblet of fire is an exceptionally magical object"")

Also, each of the tasks, (as well as the Quidditch World Cup scene and Priori Incantatem,) literally don't last 1 second longer than they had to. ...but I think that some, especially Priori Incantatem, (I really doubt I'm spelling that right,) could have lasted for at least another minute or two.

Anyway, overall, it's an excellent movie. The HP movie series has finally grown up. I can't wait to see what they'll do with the next movie.

...as for the DVD features...it's a bit disappointing this time around. This series has never really had good DVD's. Sorcerer's Stone was a joke. Chamber of Secrets was an improvement. Prisoner of Azkaban was a bigger improvement, although the interviews were ruined by the Shrunken Head.

Goblet of Fire, though, (DVD features-wise) is better than the first 2 movies but behind PoA. While GoF has a ton of ""making of"" stuff dealing with special effects, it's missing the ""making of the movie"" itself! Director Mike Newell doesn't get interviewed, (although he briefly makes some comments) none of the adult cast is interviewed, and Steve Kloves (screenwriter) and JK Rowling are completely absent. So the special features are mostly special-effects related. Although even these aren't done particularly well. They cover the 3 tasks, Voldemort, and the Yule Ball, but don't feature Priori Incantatem, the Quidditch World Cup, (or the attacks there,) the portkey, or anything about Moody's magical eye or the Pensieve.

Although there ARE some worthwhile features. The ""Reflections on the 4th film"" is a great feature, and the feature where you watch a typical day on the set for each of the 3 champions is interesting, (although again, I wish more focus was put on how they actually SHOT the scenes and less on what the studio looks like.) Plus, the deleted scenes were worth a look, even though it's clear why most of them are cut. (Only 2 of them really seem like they should have been left in; the scene where Harry, Ron, and Hermione talk in the common room before Harry visits Dumbledore, and the scene where Harry steps outside at the Yule Ball.) And, finally, they have the lame teaser trailer. (No Theatrical trailer...why...I don't know.)

Anyway, great movie, bland DVD. Someone's really gotta step it up in the DVD department on the next movie. For a movie that's grossed over 290 million domestically, the DVD features here are surprisingly uninspired. And make sure you get the ""2-Disc Special Edition"" DVD, or you get no special features at all.",1144108800,,5185,4.802690582959642
2505546,3,B000E6EK3S,"First off, I am not a big Harry Potter fan.  Never read the books, but overall enjoyed most of the movies.  However the movies seem to getting worse and worse.  Making this the worst so far.  Worth a rent, but not a buy, unless you need to complete a collection.",1144108800,,262,4.18
2505547,3,B000E6EK3S,"I wish this had been a better film. It has its moments, but the direction and editing are inferior to the previous films. Furthermore, John Williams couldn't score it--he was busy with ""Memoirs of a Geisha."" There are some good moments in music (the cute little march played by the Hogwarts band for the last Goblet of Fire event) but the rest of the score is very standard movie stuff. Boring.

The events in the book are pretty long and varied: the opening World Quidditch Cup and its following disastrous attack--and this is made short shrift of. Long amounts on time spent on the Portkey, but the actual flying of the event is cut short to go back to the tent and wait for the attack. I felt cheated there. Lots of other scenes have the same choppy cuts--was a lot of stuff dropped on the cutting room floor to make the film shorter? The editing is awful. I feel this is more post-direction and script modification rather than a poor screenplay and directing, but over all, someone is in charge of editing and this is where I feel the film really falls short.

This is one of my favorite Potter books--the idea of more schools than Hogwarts and the Triwizards Cup was an exciting concept. The short scene introducing the ""Proud Sons of Durmstrang"" and the ""Girls of Beauxbatons"" was really fun but it left me wanting more. In fact, that's how I felt about the entire film. I preferred the direction of Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n to Mike Newell, and the other directors were also better (Chris Columbus, David Yates.) This should have been a better film. It's faithful enough to the book but it's sad in that it could have been so much better. My guess is the editing is the culprit here. Great acting and good choice for the handsome Cedric. He's handsome--but has a bit of wizardly dash in dark brooding eyebrows. Casting, as ever, is perfection in these films. So close to how I envisioned while reading.",1144108800,,1905,4.583577712609971

2505549,5,B000E6EK3S,"Whether my opinion or not the Harry Potter franchise will certainly go down as one of the greatest series of films in history. The films offer absolute breathtaking visuals and special effects unprecedented in a ""kid's film."" No one has ever ventured to make such a gutsy, mature fantasy adventure film series aimed at kids and teens and they score every time. Nonetheless I ventured to see the newest installment and was absolutely blown away!! Granted I did see it on the IMAX theater but I don't think that had much to do with it. The story was so much more mature, aimed at an entirely different and diverse demographic. The story was much more simplistic, easy to follow, the characters were fun and intense, and the entire film was breathtakingly perfect!!

By now Daniel Radcliffe should have the role of Harry Potter down to a finesse so that no other person could EVER be Harry Potter and I think he does that perfectly. He's the hesitant hero, the boy wonder that is humble, honest, torn apart by a mysterious past, soft spoken and a little awkward. He is the perfect adolescent hero. He seemed to really come into character into this one and performs the role flawlessly. I'm not sure as an actor he could do much else but for this role...it was made for him. Emma Watson also returns as the rather intense Hermione Granger. She is really the opposite sex of Harry Potter but the same idea. She is for the girls to follow. She's a little awkward, she's starting to grow up, date, learn new things...she's also quite good in her role although I think she has talent left untapped beyond Harry Potter. As long as the film makers steer clear of sexualizing her just because she's getting older than it'll be fine. Rupert Grint returns as the shy, and clumsy Ron Weasley. Together the three of them make a good team and good friends and each have a different side of adolescence set out which is good. They all have very distinctive characters and they all do a great job in their roles. They really have them down pat after four films. Most of the Hogwart's teaching staff all return as well Michael Gambon, Robbie Coltrane, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and David Bradley. To really get into any depth about their characters or performances is kind of pointless. They are all great actors, most of them having been around for many years and they all fit into their roles in each installment and in this one as well perfectly. They are great!!

What truly sets Goblet of Fire apart from the others is the story. It's brilliant, non stop action and we finally lay eyes on a physical form of the evil Lord Voldemort, Harry's nemesis played brilliantly by Ralph Fiennes. New director Mike Newell I must give the most credit too, taking the helm from Chris Columbus, and Alfonso Cuar?n. Newell's approach is completely different and the film is far more mature and intense and takes the story so much further than ever before. I would even hesitate to bring young children to the film because it is that dark. But it does make it far more interesting for older children, teens and adults...widens the demographic right out and makes me edge of my seat for the next installment. The special effects are absolutely brilliant, they aren't shoddy CGI but rather brilliantly created from Hogwarts to each magic step of the Wizard's contest. I can honestly say that sometimes the acting was a little bit campy, some reactions and overly emotional moments. And the ending was a little bit cut and dry for the film that it was. Nothing was really wrapped up in the end...it would have been better to have left it hanging for the next installment but that's not the Harry Potter way and it's still the best of the series and an absolutely amazing adventure!!",1144022400,,3751,4.639097744360902

2505551,3,B000E6EK3S,"I loved this movie; it is my favorite of the four thus far.  I feel that it kept its pacing much better than the previous movie, despite the excising of huge sections of the book.

However, I write this review to point out that I found the transfer of the movie so dark that it was nearly unwatchable.  Everything was so dark that in many shots, people were mere silhouets against the background.  I saw this movie in the theater, and remember that the shots weren't like that then.  Cranking up the gamma worked, but then the picture was washed out.

I'm glad I rented before I bought.  I'll wait until another edition comes out (after all 7 movies are out?) before purchasing.",1143849600,,678,4.463414634146342
2505552,2,B000E6EK3S,"As a long-time fan of the Harry Potter series, I've watched every movie adaptation of the books, quite near the dates of their premieres. I have also frowned upon the decline in quality that Prisoner of Azkaban seemed to have started. The series was becoming a teen thriller, focusing on nothing but action, and focusing more upon milking the success of the Harry Potter franchise. Prisoner of Azkaban started this trend -- Goblet of Fire has displayed it at its most painful and frustrating stage. The film fails in two crucial areas -- acting and directing. One might even say writing.

I of course did not assume that the films would contain all of the material that J.K. Rowling originally wrote, but I at least had the expectation that the director of the movie would know what is an important story point to place emphasis upon -- in other words, what to play out, and what to leave as a side treat. The portions of the story which the director DOES emphasize are the most minimal, shallow bits that even take place in the book. The biggest example is the scene of the dragon fight. For over ten minutes or so, Harry bounds around a pit of boulders, with the dragon blowing flames, making a mess, typical dragon behavior. Then, he gets on the broom and flies around. The dragon also decides to fly around.

And BOY, do they fly around.

For about ten minutes, Harry and the dragon zip around the castle, smashing into windows, breaking roof tiles, making a severely unnecessary racket -- and for what purpose? The original purpose of the task was to take the dragon's golden egg -- and they fly about a mile away from the dragon's nest. Not only is the scene boring, as we know that Harry won't die, but, as I've just explained, it is completely pointless.

What is all the more frustrating is that important scenes that, in the book, are emotional, memorable, intense and very important to the plot are shoved aside, and merely mentioned as an afterthought to the shallow thrills which the director attempts to force upon the viewer. The most important scene in the entire story, Voldemort's return, takes a mere few minutes of screen time. There is no emotion whatsoever in the scenes. They are completely rushed and badly-done. The ominous, intimidating portrayal of Voldemort used in the first two films is completely destroyed. The character is not at all frightening. The scenes from the Pensieve, among many others are also emotionless and done out of obligation. Things such as this make the whole film feel rushed, a waste of time.

Now, another major problem. Acting. Both in the actors' direction and personal performances. Daniel Radcliffe, as Harry, is just as he's always been: somewhat suitable, but at times faultering, and needing improvement. Rupert Grint, as Ron, is actually okay. Emma Watson, I am sad to say, has become quite the over-actor. She used to be charming and funny as Hermione, but in Goblet she tries much too hard, and reminds me very much of an eight-year-old in a home video, making a ""movie"" with her other young siblings, in which she becomes frustrated over little things, huffing and puffing with her hands on her hips, etc., etc. And another tragic disappointment was Michael Gambon's performance as Dumbledore. The warm, funny, quirky Dumbledore we all knew and loved has been replaced with a slightly insane old man who seems to have a dangerous temper problem. For example, in the scene after Harry's name comes out of the goblet, he comes barging into the backroom in which the champions wait, grabbing Harry by the shoulders, holding him against a wall, quickly and madly asking him whether or not he put his name in the Goblet, as though the wrong answer will earn Harry two black eyes. Very disappointing. The only performances I did enjoy were those of Mad Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson) and the Weasely Twins (James and Oliver Phelps). Moody was just as insane, twitchy, and funny as the character was in the book, and the twins have finally become just as likable and funny as those from the book. If only the rest of the movie had been that spot-on.

Even had this been an original movie/story, had the films existed without the books, had J.K. Rowling been a screen writer rather than an author, Goblet of Fire would still have been a disappointment. It looks great, I'll admit. Most scenes are very nice-looking and well-made, in terms of appearence. But what good is watching some pretty scenes if they aren't beautiful enough to stir the imagination, and to make up for the thinnness of the material? You might say that good appearence-driven movies can be made, and OF COURSE they can (Where would directors such as Tim Burton and Stanley Kubrick ever be if it weren't for their artistic genious?). But this is not Edward Scissorhands, nor is it 2001: A Space Odyssey. It's Harry Potter. Two hours and thirty-seven minutes of it. The images shown through these 157 minutes do not mask the fact that the whole movie is emotionless, shallow, irritatingly fast-paced, and in the end the only enjoyment felt is that of watching the credits roll and being glad that the whole thing is over.",1143849600,,5146,4.744134078212291

It would have been a great movie if it had shown all of that. I was so looking forward to seeing Hermione trying to get the elves on strike. That factor made me so upset. This movie only features Harry and the Tri-Wizard Tornament. So, don't buy this if you THINK that it's going to be just like the book. Again, a lot of the events in the book are not in the movie.

2505570,5,B000E6EK3S,"I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter series and highly recommend this movie to add to your collection.  For those of you who are not familiar with the story, the fourth book basically brings about a tournament in which three wizards, one from Hogwarts and two from visiting wizarding schools, compete in three extremely dangerous and difficult tasks to win the tri-wizard cup and eternal glory.  The Goblet of Fire is where entrants submit their names.  The goblet then selects three wizards to compete.  New rules set forth that only wizards seventeen and older were allowed to compete.  However, not only is Harry Potter selected, he is one of four, not three...who put his name in the cup?  Watch the movie to find out.  This year's new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher is Mad Eye Moody, an ex-auror who uses a practical approach to teaching magic and befriends and helps Harry, on Dumbledore's orders, throughout the tournament.  This book also brings about the return of Lord Voldemort.  It's a thrilling, exciting, and action packed movie from beginning to end, with dragons, dangerous mermaids, and a killer maze to boot!

OVERALL
The Goblet of Fire was a highly entertaining movie.  True it doesn't follow the book to the letter, but it becomes increasingly more difficult to follow JK Rowling's detailed storylines when the books become increasingly longer.  Things have to be shortened, modified, or dropped altogether and I felt the screenwriters did a fine job of keeping and/or detailing what was neccessary.

CASTING
The casting of Ralph Fiennes and Voldemort was superb and that final scene with Harry was as chilling and frightening as the book described.  For the most part, the three champions (Krum, Cedric, and Fleur) were depicted quite successfully, although I felt that Fleur's character was depicted on the ""wimpier"" side than as described in the book.  Mad-Eye Moody's casting I think was second most successful only to Voldemort.

MUSIC
The most glaring negative comment I have to offer are with regard to the musical score.  As wonderful a composer Patrick Doyle is and as fitting as the score ended up being, I was very disappointed by John Williams (who of course scored the first three) absence from the fourth installment.  Again, it may have only been noticeable to a small number of people (particularly myself, who is not only a big fan of John Williams and his music, but a composition student in graduate school as well) and it served its purpose just fine, but it still fell short of what Williams has provided in movies' past.

ABOUT THE DELUXE EDITION
The Deluxe edition has great behind the scenes shorts included, exploring the difficulties of filming, the lives of the cast, to the dance scene choreography, as well as a question and answer period with the cast and contest winners.",1143590400,,2828,4.9033613445378155
2505571,4,B000E6EK3S,"Goblet of Fire is definitely one of the best Harry Potter movies. After seeing it only once, I can't decide whether I prefer it, or Prisoner of Azkaban. PoA gets extra points for having David Thewlis as Lupin - a wonderful addition to the series as one of the only dependable adult presences in Harry's life, but Goblet of Fire finally adds Lord Voldemort, Alistair Moody, Cedric Diggory, Barty Crouch and so many other characters I've been waiting to see.

A lot of viewers object to the editing job the writers did to the book. Well. Have you LOOKED at the size of that thing recently? I loved the book, I really did, but after reading it and re-reading it a number of times, well, it could have used another edit. It's just a monster. There is NO WAY to fit that sucker into a two and a half hour movie. It wasn't going to happen. So I'm amenable to the changes they made because they had to, they honestly did. Would I have done it exactly the same way? Maybe not, but that doesn't mean it's a bad job.

 Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint do good work in this installment. They both have nice comedic timing, especially together, and I think that Daniel Radcliffe's dramatic chops have improved considerably since the last movie. Which is good, because that scene in HP3 in Hogsmeade? When Harry thinks that Sirius betrayed his parents when he was their friend? That was embarrassing. However, this movie also confirms something I suspected in the Prisoner of Azkaban, namely that Emma Watson cannot act. She is very cute, she IS movie-Hermione, but she has not improved at ALL over the series, I am sorry to say.

As to the new characters, Ralph Fiennes was quite good and actually not over the top as Lord Voldemort. David Tennant must have had fun being so rabid and out of control as Barty Crouch(and just for the record, that is not a criticism. I liked his performance). I was totally charmed by Katie Leung as Cho; although I was never particularly fond of the character, she made me like her with her Irish? accent-unexpected, that. I could ramble on for a while, but in essence,  it is a good movie, I will see it again and I hope to see more sequels like it.",1143504000,,2172,4.474747474747475

If you've read the book, please don't be disappointed that they can't fit everything from the book into the movie.  What they do include is well-done and in keeping with the earlier Potter movies.

The two-disc edition is worth it just for the interviews with Harry, Hermione, and Ron, but it also shows how they filmed Harry's underwater scenes--he really had to hold his breath!

You'll especially like Ralph Fiennes, as this episode's evil Voldemort, (listen to how he hisses his threats!) and slso you will probably flinch and squirm at the attack of the terrifying Hungarian Horntail Dragon.

2505588,3,B000E6EK3S,"At this point, it doesn't matter how well filmed an adaptation it is, these movies are only going to come off like two-and-a-half-hour long commercials for the book.

All the usual cast return for the very middle of the series, all in their robes and ready to say their lines and get out of the way of the camera for the next shot so that we can fit it all in. Several questions come to mind watching these young and intrepid kids trying their best to be their characters: What's gonna happen to these young stars after it's all over? Is Daniel Radcliffe disappointed that at this point he has no chance of learning how to act with ever shortening takes in which to deliver his lines? Will Rupert Grint ever be taken seriously after doing seven movies in a row about being a hero's buffoonish sidekick? What about that young man playing Draco Malfoy? He seems the type to become one of those typecast badguys that everyone loves to hate. At least that seems fun. Though I must say if I were Daniel Radcliff and company, I would totally rake in the cash I get from this endeavor and spend the rest of my life reading Dante, Milton, and Dostoyevsky without the translations.

Really that's what was fun about this movie, watching it through the eyes of a talent scout and thinking, ""Where can all this talent go?"" Sure, all of them do their jobs spectacularly. Too bad they didn't have enough time to do it. In fact, it wasn't until after the movie ended that I suddenly realized that I would have had no idea what was going on had I read the book. This movie fails to do some basic narrative things that create gaping plot holes: Uh, okay so yeah, Barty Crouch Jr. is a death eater and all. But, uh, where did he come from? How did he manage to do all of that? When did he capture Moody? Oops... all that work and the basic premise of the movie is completely disregarded.

But it was fun. Ralph Fiennes makes a great Voldemort, even if he didn't have time to be truly evil. Instead he succeeds admirably at being creepy. Good stuff.

This film is also important in that it reveals that pop music is just as terrible in fantasy worlds as it is in real ones. So much for escapism, eh?

2505589,2,B000E6EK3S,"First off, I have to say that I loved the first 2 movies.

I was severly disappointed by the third movie. I think it was a hack job and only mildly entertaining. This one, while better than PoA, is still kind of a PoS.

Why is it these directors keep on insisting on draining as much color out of these movies as they can? This seems to play down the darkness when something evil happens, since it feels so dreary anyways.

Second, this movie should have been broken into 2 parts. Initially it was going to be, however after speaking to Alfonse Curan, this director decided to make it as short as possible.

I think someone should have decided long before it hit the theaters, to so something like what they did with lord of the rings and come up with an extended edition with extra footage.

This series isn't over yet with the books. Therefore the movies cant know what to cut and what to leave in. Sometimes the most minute detail will come back later on, and then you go.. Aha!

These directors need to make the film their own, I do agree with that, however there is a fine line on what should be cut, and what shouldnt be messed with. This movie felt like it was just a bunch of snippets thrown together. There was no real tension anywhere cause it just bounced everywhere.

You can claim that the dragon fighting scene was tense, but i say since everyone knows that there are 2 more books, that Harry doesnt die kinda ruins any moment of suspense. It was a brilliant scene, but over extended (Similar to the Gryphon flight in the 3rd movie)

I wish instead of trying to make a movie fit into 2.5 hours, they would try to make a quality picture... and give it at least 3 hours or so. In both pictures, just 15-20 minutes could have added an enormous amount of depth and made them both worthy successors to the first 2.

If they try to cram OoP into 2.5 hours, I will not see it. They are continuing to choose ADHD viewing over integrity.

Peter Jackson was in love with Lord of The Rings. He wanted to do it justice, while at the same time making the movie his own. Then on DVD release, he also made it the fans by offering them a lil bit more of what they wanted.

I think these people who cut and cut and cut what they think are unimportant things just to fit it into 2.5 hours, really should NOT direct anymore. GoF was one of my favorite books in the series, and as a movie left me wanting more. Cutting out Winky was pointless... instead they give us a 5 minute scene of harry looking at a ten graveyard. Subtle differences, like making a tongue flicker, or moving the weasleys to a lower seet, or making Krum appear egotistical in his opening shot... why change such subtle things. There is no reason, and it doesnt upset their precious time crunch. I think they are taking too many liberties, and I wish they would make a movie worthy of belonging to this franchise.",1143244800,,2878,4.311111111111111

And can't smell something's fishy

With dragons, eggs and water

The final takes them in a maze

And leads them to the slaughter

2505591,3,B000E6EK3S,"To say I was disappointed by Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire when I first saw the film is a major understatement. My favorite parts of the book come right up front-the arrival of the Weasley's to pick up Harry from the Dursley's and the Quidditch World Cup-so seeing one part cut to barely a mention and the other cut completely made me, in a word, livid less than five minutes into the movie. After that, it didn't have a chance with me. Granted, I know you can't pack everything in a massive book like ""Goblet of Fire"" and have it fit in a movie less than four hours long; however, directors have a really terrible knack of looking at novels as starting points rather than blueprints. When they go hacking at a novel to cut the fat they inevitably cut out muscle and bone in their attempts to shorten a novel and make it more ""cinematic."" Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a perfect example of this. Director Mike Newell, a man best-known for directing Four Weddings and a Funeral and therefore the absolute worst person you could pick to direct a Harry Potter movie, hacks at J.K. Rowling's novel not with a carving knife, but a machete. What's left is a confusing mess. That said, I have to admit as my expectations lowered for DVD viewing I did enjoy the film more. It allowed me to focus more on the excellent effects, Oscar-nominated sets, and the much-improved acting of the kids, especially Daniel Radcliff. Still, there is a lot I don't like about the film. Plot points are changed for no apparent reason other than to tinker which will have an impact on future adaptations of the remaining books. The music by Patrick Doyle (a very good, but in over his head, composer) is so inappropriate in parts it's laughable as all of John Williams' three previous scores, save for the scant use of ""Hedwig's Theme"" here and there, is thrown out. Most everyone except Harry has their screen time reduced to almost cameo levels. This movie IS about Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, PERIOD. If you're a fan of the books and can watch the movies as their own entity, you'll enjoy Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. If you're like me and have a problem separating the two, be sure to watch it more than once to appreciate what's good about the movie and get past what's so very, very wrong.",1143244800,,2301,4.467933491686461

""Never mind the quill"". I think many of us share her view of this annoying brand of news media that twists the truth. What I really adore about the entire Potter series is the way the writer has allowed Harry's character to grow up.

The movie starts off fast but pulls itself together.  There is a lot more plain talking between students which helps to make Hogwarts seem like a real school.  Unlike the Prisoner of Azkaban which just went from the big points of the book, the Goblet of Fire makes everything seem more real.

The tasks in the movie were very well done, except the final task, I am not trying to ask the directors of the movie to put in every single detail in the movie as was in the book, but in the final task there is hardly any opposition at all to Harry trying to get the Triwizard cup, all that stands in his way is a few branches that come out of the ground and try to pull him into the trees.

2505594,2,B000E6EK3S,"Alright

here is the lowdown

he got harry potter 4

by far the worse of the series.

By the making of this movie you can tell the director editor actors blah blah blah knew they could S*** out a movie and it would still make 500 million dollars;which it did. Now harry potter (daniel radcliff<sp>) is playing the ever so easy role of harry potter. He got lucky he was a cute kid because if he went to any casting  acting like he did in the movie he wouldn't have got the part. The only one that really is a god actor in the whole movie is Hermonie (Emma Watson). She is still one of the best child actors in the game.

</Center>The movie took me back into the world of Harry Potter, once again wishing I was a wizard...But the greatness stops there. The over dramic scenes mixed with bad acting really took me out of that wonderful high we all recive when viewing a Harry Potter film.

The scene with Harry and _____ (cough voldamore <sp> was pretty dark but hopefully with the sequals they can take it to the next level of darkness as the books get better. I would say skip this movie. Although it has it moments, It doesn't bring it well....

2505597,4,B000E6EK3S,"When my sister popped this DVD into the player, I was seriously setting myself up to dislike the movie. Oddly enough I knew what to expect of it. My sister had read to me the fourth year book since I could never really get past chapter TWO of any of the series, because in plain truth, Harry Potter is a boring book to me. I hold a tolerance towards the movie and find it more enjoyable to watch on screen, however. She got as far as the first task and the Yule Ball and then stopped. To my surprise, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" turned out to be a good movie highlighting Harry Potter struggling through the trials and tribulations of teeange-angst and what not (I'm basically at the end of mine. 17 will do that do you). The PG-13 rating was a serious tactical plan for gaining money from the teenage groups. GOF was no more violent or disturbing than the last three PG movies. Seriously, don't insult my intelligence Warner Bros. The storyline is pretty much the exact same as the book: [After awaking from a nightmare Harry Potter, the Weasleys and Hermione rendezvous with the Diggorys at dawn to attend the Quidditch World Cup. The group arrive on top of a hill with an old boot which transports them to the moor where the World Cup is to be held. The Quidditch World Cup in the film is brief and gets a simple the introduction of two teams. Afterwards, a riot suddenly erupts at the campsite. Masked wizards ambush the camp site and burn the tents. Harry is knocked unconscious by the fleeing crowd. Later, Harry wakes up and sees a man, whom promptly runs away. When the young wizard explains what happened to his friends, Hermione advises Harry to write to Sirius Black about the mysterious events happening].

I have to say the starting of the movie taking place in Harry's Dream, was a bit quick in the mysterious explanation department. And to make matters worse, Harry is already spending the summer with the Weasleys and Hermonine has already arrived! Would it have killed the director or the screenplay writer to add the rest of the beginning of the book into the movie? Honestly, I felt like I had been thrown into the middle of a battle and I don't know what's going on or who to do battle with. The movie continues this type of pace as it progresses and skims through the Quidditch World Cup and straight into the attack of the Deatheaters. Daniel Radcliffe has gotten far better at acting now after six years of HP. He's not so rigid and forceful in the dramatic acting department. This, however, cannot be said about Emma Watson. While she portrays the snooty and ""too-smart for her own good"" Hermonine perfectly, I can't help but feel as though her performance throughout the entire movie series has been forceful, trying too hard to be convincing at what she does to be brief.  Why they tired to play her character in the movie as a sort of peacekeeper between Ron and Harry is beyond me. In the book she was just as worse as the two boys were with her ""Save the House Elf's"" rally.

The positive thing about this movie is that it does indeed focus on the more major points of the story. However, little things that made the story mildly interesting to me were left out in a major way. Not even Rita Skeeter was used that much. Other problems I had with the film background itself was the CGI; Most of the time it looked a little foggy, almost bland or flat in some places than others (I.E., the second task --underwater scene-- and the final task). Another disappointment was the first task and Harry's Battle against the Hungarian Horntail. I've noticed since ""Reign Of Fire"" everyone has taken to the ""fire created by two chemicals"" as opposed to the usual ""fire breathing from the throat"" dragon scenario, which was good, but that entire scene was a major let down. It seriously lacked in the blood-pumping action I expected from such a moment.

The atmosphere was not so sleepy like the third movie but it did lack the certain charisma the previous film had. The humor in the film is fresh and easy to laugh at; Especially whenever Ron's twin brothers Fred and George Weasley, whose antics and behavior is very true to the characters; You get a good laugh at their hustling tactics, trying to past the age line around the Goblet of Fire, and teasing a dateless Ron and Harry about the Yule Ball. The heated feud between Harry and Ron was well acted by Grint and Radcliffe, who come off perfectly as two teenage friends angry and frustrated at each other because Harry's name was inserted in the Goblet of Fire. Their acting was even better when their characters struggled to find a date with a girl. Harry's line, ""Why do they all have to travel in packs?"" got a good laugh out of me. I could truly sympathize with them, in spite of my being a girl and having never been in a situation like that before. The scene in which Harry confronts Cho Chang to ask her to go to the dance was as sweet as it was giggle-material.

The way Harry comes running back when Cho calls for him is proof the boy is clearly dumbstruck in love with (or crushing hard on) the girl. The actors for the other schools in France and Bulgaria were pretty good to say the least. It was nice to see an actual French actor (Clemence Poesy) cast as Fleur Delacour and a Bulgarian actor (Stanislav Ianevksi) as Victor Krum, instead of having other actors (most notably Americans) portray these characters with fake accents. Robert Pattinson portrayed Cedric Diggory excellently; While he didn't have that much screen time, whenever he was present, the character was brought off the pages of the book itself, quite nicely too. Ralph Fiennes as the most feared wizard, Lord Voldemort was actually an excellent choice. While he's not my favorite actor, I pretty much know him for playing in some pretty good movies (with the exception of ""Maid in Manhattan"") - like the much talked about ""The Constant Gardner."" While he pulled off the villainy of the Dark Lord perfectly, he lacked the certain air of fear or and downright foulness that surrounded the character in the book. Nevertheless, Fiennes pulled the dialogue for the character off pretty well in some scenes.

The score composed by Patrick Doyle was by far the best choice for this particular film in general. While John Williams didn't do a bad job for the last three films, Doyle brings a certain air of change and freshness that would be otherwise ignored in Williams score which is now so familiar in the movies. But if I had to choose who did the better ""Action Theme"" it would be John Williams hands down. One a last note, this review is for the SINGLE-DISC EDITION which has no special features at all. If your looking for more than just the movie, then go with the TWO-DISC SPECIAL EDITION. I'm seriously wondering why they released two DVD versions to begin with, anyway. All in all ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of fire"" turns out to be a good movie, with serious flaws, but a good movie nonetheless. It will probably the one out of the 3 films that will not completely please fans of the Book (my sister included). Nevertheless this is a highly recommended movie. -------- [a 4 out of 5]",1143072000,,7157,4.548487199379363

Most reviewers complain that it is a children's book, but when they took their kids to see it, they were shocked. CHECK THE RATING PEOPLE! The movie is PG-13, but just barely. To anyone who is uncertain whether to see this movie or let kids see this movie, other reviewers are letting this get out of hand. One complaint that I have read and looks scary to parents is: ""At one point, Harry is in a bathtub with a ghost girl"". This gives you the completely wrong image, and let me assure you, there is nothing like that. Harry is actually in a bathtub the size of a swimming pool with a ghost girl on the other side talking to him. There is rarely anything suggestive, and the violence in the movie is kept to a minimum with no blood or gore.
All that aside, you should see this movie. Mike Newell takes the reins of this wildly popular series and puts in some fresh new ideas. He doesn't waste time on petty scenes, as nearly all of the film is shot at Hogwarts. There are beautiful special effects but not so that they take over the movie and we lose sight on the familiar characters. I noticed that this movie is mostly about Harry and his development as a wizard and human being. Ron and Hermione are still very involved, but some other characters like Hagrid and the ever hated Draco Malfoy have  about 1 line. This movie is mainly about how Harry has to rely on his friends for support. For instance they all have to tackle adolescence together, such as when Harry and Ron have to invite a girl to the Yule Ball. All of this is entertaining to watch, but the miovie gets even better when it turns on a darker note.

One thing though.  I think that some of the magic is gone.  I used to chalk it up to being used to the world or the characters now and all, but I really think some of it has to do with them not wear robes around school much anymore.  They hardly wear robes at all in GOF.

Not worth watching a second time, but if you're collecting the films and the books, you need this. I also bought the first DVD I saw, and it had NO extras. Not a conversation, not a deleted scene, nothing.

WB has chosen to come out now with 2 editions, where you have to pay a much higher price for these same extras that came standard in the other movies. On top of that, not even a one-sheet was added to the ""normal"" 1 disk full or widescreen editions. I am very disappointed in this obvious money-making tactic of the WB, as well as their cheapness at not even giving the fan a booklet or even a one-sheet.

This film does a pretty good job of translating the book to the screen, though necessarily about half the plot is eliminated in order to keep the story to a resonable length.  There are spectacular special effects which will keep the children entertained, and although much of the humour of the book is missing, there is enough left to raise a few smiles.

In my opinion, this is the darkest of the series and certainly the most memorable. But, unlike it's predessesors, it's plotline revolves around a contest that is strickly for experienced students of the right age. But the tables turn When Harry gets picked by the goblet of fire. And the mood and tone suggests that something, out in the wizard world, is definetely stirring. Some legions of people connected to the dark arts. I liked this one the best of all. You can watch it over and over again. And, compared with the other harry potter flicks, this one earned over 800 million world wide and was an imediate smash hit. Even more popular on DVD now. I absolutely loved this dark, mysterious, well-thought out installment. The only big problem now is that the next movie in the series has to fill some pretty big shoes in order to surpass this masterpiece of fantasy fiction.",1142812800,,1034,4.564516129032258
2505617,4,B000E6EK3S,"My biggest complaint about the first three ""Harry Potter"" movies is that the films (along with the books) have been kinda dark and edgy for the kids who've been reading them. With this film, the fourth entry in the ""Potter"" film franchise, that doesn't change, even though the MPAA has finally given a PG-13 rating to one of the films (Which they should've been doing since the first one).

The film itself is actually pretty good. The cast and crew do a commendable job of transferring a 700+ page book into a two-and-a-half hour film. The acting is good, including a sinister turn by Ralph Fiennes as the resurrected Lord Voltemort that even had me terrified. The visual effects are top notch, and the storytelling is good for the most part. But the film's darker edge, as well as a few moments of sheer tragedy, make it unsuitable for younger viewers, even those who are ardent ""Potter"" fans. But there's some good to be found here, so I recommend the film for those older fans.

People keep saying that this movie was badly put together and a terrible adaption.  Well guess what?  IT ISN'T!  In fact, it's the best of them so far.  They CANNOT possibly make it extremely close to the book.  The books just get bigger now.  There's no way you're going to get to see all that stuff you want in the books.  You won't get to see much of the Order of the Phoenix's headquarters (unless we're lucky)  in the next movie.  Probably from here on out the movies will feel rushed, they'll add things that aren't necessary, they'll move things around.  IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN AND IF YOU'RE GOING TO LET SOMETHING STUPID LIKE THAT RUIN IT FOR YOU, THEN YOU SHOULDN'T WATCH HARRY POTTER MOVIES AT ALL!

This was a great movie.  There should have been more of the Quidditch world cup, the tasks should have been a little better, they should've shown Fudge getting all upset because he doesn't want to gbelieve that Voldemort's back, and maybe a less rushed beginning but that's all.

2505619,5,B000E6EK3S,"It's very nice to watch how the quality of the Harry Potter movies improve...:

""The Sorcerer's Stone"" was the first HP movie, so it was destinated to be the ""worst"" one, because as it was the first, there also had to be an introduction for the characters.

""The Chamber Of Secrets"" had more action, better effects, and the actors were ""older"", so their performances also improved.

""The Prisoner Of Azkaban"" is one of the best Harry Potter books, and also it's, for me, the second best Harry Potter movie as well. The effects are intense and entertaining, the story modified to the movie worked very well.

""The Goblet Of Fire"" is actually my favorite Harry Potter movie. I already read the rest of the books that are released and I dno't think there's going to be a better movie than this one. The story is very exciting, and there are lots of more scary, entertaining and funny scenes than in the other movies. By now, this movie tops them all. I also got very impressed about the performance by Emma Watson and Daniel Radcliffe (Hermione and Harry), I think they really improved themselves and did a great job in this movie.

The deluxe edition of the DVD is the same as the other DVD's, the disc 2 are just silly (but fun) games and interviews.",1142812800,,1249,4.533333333333333

It was according to the teenagers a waste of money to make the movie, if you are not going to follow the plotline of the book.",1142812800,,396,4.142857142857143
2505621,3,B000E6EK3S,"ON THE FILM:
As a fan of all the previous Harry Potter films, and having read all of the books, I was really looking forward to ""Goblet of Fire,"" especially since it was my favorite book as well. That may be why I was so disappointed after actually seeing it. The main problem with ""Goblet of Fire,"" is that Director Mike Newell tried to condense way too much into a two hour movie. I know this has been a criticism of the previous films, but I have never agreed with it until now. There is no way to include everything from the books into the films, and in most cases the cuts in previous films have been just. However in this case, the book was way too long for a two hour movie.

Noticeably absent are the relationships between Hermione and Ron, Harry and Cho, and Harry and Draco. Harry and Draco are enemies, and their rivalry has always played a very large role in the books, especially given Draco's actions in future books. His character had roughly 60 seconds of screen time in this film and a handful of lines. His scenes could have been cut out completely and it wouldn't have changed the movie much from the way it turned out. Professor Snape was given a similar treatment. Newell tried to display jealousy between Ron and Hermione, but it failed miserably as they did not have development for the audience to believe in it. The character of Rita Skeeter was introduced as a nosy reporter, however she added absolutely nothing to the movie and is another character that is very prominent in the book, but could have been completely cut out of this film and it would not have made a difference.

The majority of the movie focused on the Tri-Wizard tournament, which was very well done, but was not the focus of the book and made for a film that kids would probably love, but does not do justice for the adult viewer who wants to see more character development. The final task of the tournament, the maze, was not adequately explained at all. In the book, the maze brings out the worst fears in someone and turns them against themseves. In the movie, it was condensed to just being a creepy maze that attacked you with roots.

My other biggest problem was with the casting, specifically Michael Gambon as Dumbledore and Stanislav Ianevski as Viktor Krum. I've heard the complaints of Gambon not living up to the precedent set in previous films by Richard Harris, and never believed it until now. He comes off completely out of character from the Dumbledore in the book. He is gruff and abrasive in this film, at one point grabbing Harry and shaking him violently. Where is the wise and compassionate, yet still powerful, Dumbledore from the books? Ianevski looks good on the posters, but his acting seems too unseasoned for a role this big. Cedric Diggory and Fleur Delacour are very well casted however.

Edit 5 January 2012 - Having seen all of the films in the franchise now, I actually appreciate this movie a lot more and think it is one of the better ones in the series. I still think it should have been cut into two films and feels condensed, but the tri-wizard tournament is one of the more climatic events during all of the movies and is very well done.",1142812800,,3173,4.51304347826087
2505622,5,B000E6EK3S,"If you want just the Movie, and you don't want to see ""behind the curtains"", then get the Single disc version.

The Audio is great on the DVD's for the double disc version, and for my money I like the darker tone; it is clearly a film with an Adult Audience in mind, however the Child fan base will be happy.

The Extras are lots better than some previous pieces; at least they take things more seriously; and this may be somewhat of a downfall. I managed to get the Hologram  package which is a great set. The only downfall on the second  disc is the interactive game, which works well for kids, but is not the best for adults. However the detail of the FX in the features are very good, but the menu is very badly designed.

2505625,5,B000E6EK3S,"Mike Newell takes over as director for this movie and in my view did very well on capturing the darkness and also the fun of this book.

The Goblet Of Fire movie obviously can't hold everything the book has, so a lot of scenes are left out. In fact, the first two to three chapters alone are skipped. Almost every child actor returns for this movie. I think the best performance was given by Emma Watson, i thought she stole the show. Although things are skipped, the book still gives script writers much to play off of. The Goblet Of Fire book probably is the best book in the series suited to be made into a movie and i think that really shows.

The first time i saw the film in theaters, it took me some getting use to Ralph Fiennes who plays Lord Voltemort, i wasn't impressed by his first few minutes in the picture. I wasn't until the final showdown with Harry that i began to like him. There are also characters that i felt weren't used enough, Snape was one of them, he makes a lot of appearances in the film but really no words to say and anyone who has read the book knows his character is much bigger in the book. Gary Oldman is only in the film maybe 5 minutes.

My favorite scene is the Maze scene, i thought that was well constructed and the tone of the scene is really good. That scene alone really does show how much darker this movie is. Another great scene, which is also my favorite part in the book, is the Yule Ball. That scene is almost perfect compared to how it is described in the book. I loved Rupert Grint's and Emma Watson's performances, they were great. Rupert Grint is always funny but that line ""Your Fratinizing With The Enemy"", is hilarious.

This movie went to PG-13, which caught a lot of people off guard, even caught me off guard. This movies dark tone and fantasy violence probably made the rating for the movie hard to choose, this is very violent compared to the previous three.

Overall, 5 out of 5. Out of all four movies, this movie really is the superior film thus far and shows that this series is only going to get stronger and darker for that matter. This movie was perfect in the theaters, with 289 million dollars in the U.S. Box Office, 601 million dollars internationally and is still gaining internationally, totaling to 890 million total. That is without a doubt impressive.

DVD Extras Review: I love all of the features about this movie, especially the one where they reflect on the fourth film, it's just nice to see how they made this impressive movie. Another great feature is the making of the Yule Ball, it's hilarious watching them learn how to dance. There are a bunch more, the features get a 5 out of 5.",1142726400,,2668,4.37979797979798

2505628,4,B000E6EK3S,"The movie, as a movie, not compared to the book, was good.

Terrific special effects, great action, rather funny.

Although, I do feel that you'd have to read the book to completely understand the movie. Many things were unclear if you weren't familiar with the characters: the cast talked too fast, plot was greatly accelerated, many important events were taken out, many new characters were not properly introduced (and I feel the same way about the third movie, Prisoner of Azkaban).

This movie, being taken from the second longest book (734 pgs, hardback), is shorter than the second movie (which is the longest movie), which comes from a book that is less than half as long (341 pgs hardback, second shortest book). This means that in order for this movie to be closely congruent with the novel, it would have to be more than 4 hrs long. Not many people would want to sit in a theatre that long, children (don't forget, they're the main audience for this movie) don't have that kind of attention span, and surely parents would not sit that long to watch it with their under-thirteen year-old children. Also, it would be illogical to split the movie into two separate movies, considering you'd have to do so in the middle of the triwizard tourney.

My suggestion is, if you don't get it, read the book, then watch again.

This is my favorite book from the series. It really does deserve better treatment than what was given to it in this film, but obviously creating a 4 hr long film wasn't rational, so how it was treated was great for the time limit that they had to work with. Please give it a chance. It's fun, action-packed, and has a lot of things you can talk about with your children.",1142640000,,1697,4.587458745874588

The Lord of the Rings movies are a wonderful example of the right way to take a long, detailed story and turn it into a captivating film that captures the spirit of the book.  That is my main complaint about this (and the other 3) Harry Potter movies.  The spirit of the book -- the sense of magic and wonder -- is not there.

Another small complaint I have is that the movie seems to made for those of us who have read the book.  They skim over necessary details that leaves a viewer without background information a little lost.  I watched this movie with someone who had not read the book, and he was pretty confused about several things that happened in the movie.",1142640000,,847,4.229813664596273

GOFtm is so disjoint and illogical and the progress through it so unmotivated that a fair amount of what happens in it makes no sense.

2505631,3,B000E6EK3S,"Someone who simply loves Harry Potter, the books and the films, in other words someone who stays one saving step away from fandom, inevitably must have noticed that ""true"" Potter fans are an exceptionally tough folk to please; at least when it comes to the film adaptions of their beloved novels.

After ""Prisoner Of Azkaban"", many fans complained about the movie. Too many changes, too much left out, and so on and so forth. Now, just as fans demanded, director Mike Newell and Potter veteran Steve Kloves (screenplay) created something that is the opposite of that; not too many changes, and desperate tries to cram as much into ""Goblet Of Fire"" as possible. Consequently, this film lacks coherence, good pacing and vividly drawn characters. So bitching Potter afficiandos, watch it and be quiet, this is what you've cried for!

And you've cried for it because you've missed one, maybe the crucial point: this is NOT a book. ""Prisoner Of Azkaban"" might have taken out some plot elements from the novel, but it worked brilliantly as a film. Alfonso Cuaron took the central storyline first and made it work, everything else around it was pure luxury; this is how a literary adaption should be handled.

""Goblet Of Fire"" doesn't feel like a well- flowing film, more like randomly chosen scenes from the book stitched together. There were elements carried over into the film that didn't have to be there: cut the Quidditch World Cup, for heaven's sake! You can't make it any longer without ruining the film, and as it is right now, it's completely redundant. Nobody needs to see Victor Krum in Quidditch action, one adoring remark from Ron during Durmstrang's arrival at Hogwarts would have been enough. The Dark Mark isn't necessary either. Even worse, it almost gives away the resolution of the storyline. Let's see, Voldemort's supposed to be back, someone put Harry's name into the goblet to get him killed, and there's a weird new Defence Against The Dark Arts teacher at work ... how in the world am I supposed to know how this one's going to turn out?

Then Hagrid's crush on Madame Maxime: another example of ""either do it or don't"". Either you wrap up the storyline by revealing Madame Maxime's roots, or you leave it out, but you can't have a story thread dangling in the air like that at the end of  a film.

Speaking of stories, there's no attempt made in the entire film to fill the story with tension. The events take place because they take place; it seems like Mike Newell had the attitude ""you know the story anyhow"".

Throwing out Hermione's house- elf- mania and centering the film around the Triwizard Tournament were very good, although obvious, choices. The execution of the tournament, however, doesn't really appeal to me. This is supposed to be a legendary event, an event as ancient and as glorious as Hogwarts, but it appears to be more like a Volksfest in the movie, and not all that important. When the goblet chooses the three (four) champions, the students stand around like they were on the way from Divination to Herbology. Before the third task, hundreds of people gather in some sort of stadium while Polka music plays (which is itself ridiculous, considering the otherwise Scottish touch of the film), and you expect a pretzel salesman in leather pants to come around the corner any second.

And although ""Goblet Of Fire"" seems to be centered around the Triwizard Tournament, I can't help but feel that the film lacks some focus.

I constantly hear fans demanding a longer running time. A longer running time wouldn't have made ""Goblet Of Fire"" better, there are bigger, more essential mistakes at work here.

Folks, the running time is perfectly fine, it's the structure of the movie that doesn't work. ""Prisoner Of Azkaban"" isn't much shorter and works perfectly.

Of course a couple of words must be lost about the graveyard scene with Voldemort at the end. Let me say that Ralph Fiennes' Voldemort is overacted. He could have been so spooky with a more subtle, less shouty performance.

The appearance of Harry's parents (for the umptiest time, but that's a different story) is indeed very haunting and well done ... if, well if it was explained to the audience why the hell those ghosts appear! The last, most unbelievable example of ""could have, should have, didn't"". Harry even asks Dumbledore about it, and all he has to say is ""Priori Incantatem"". Well, it's nice they've included this title, but it explains nothing.

The effects, as well as the makeup and the costumes are all outstanding again, but that can be expected by now.

What's left to say? I pity David Yates, the director of Order Of The Phoenix, for all the unnecessary catching up he has to do in film #5.",1142553600,,4713,4.781057810578106

I loved the first two Harry Potter movies but wasn't really excited by Prisoner of Azkaban.  I hated the dim lighting used throughout P of A and was very disappointed by the new Dumbledore.  So my hopes were really not up too high for the Goblet of Fire movie but now that I've seen it, I must say I really enjoyed it.  The lighting is darker than that used in the first two movies but it's a huge improvement over P of A.  Also, I think Michael Gambon's performance as Dumbledore showed some improvement.  He behaved more as the strong, wise wizard Dumbledore is this time around.  Gambon still needs to try to bring out Dumbledore's heart/humor more though.  I was very happy with everything in the film and my only complaints are with what was left out.  I think the opening was too abrupt  and left me disoriented for the first few minutes.  Even a short visit with the Dursleys and a little background as to what was going on would have really helped.  I would also like to have seen more of Professors McGonagall and Snape as well as more Hagrid.  On the other hand, the casting of new characters was very well done.  Ralph Fiennes and Brendon Gleeson in particular, gave tremendous performances and added alot to the movie.  Without a doubt, the special effects were the best ever in all 4 films. The dragon and lake challenges were awesome in fact.  The action and suspense were fabulous and the Yule Ball was entirely enjoyable.  So overall I think the movie was excellant and I'm impressed with what it was able to accomplish in just 2 and half hours.

2505636,4,B000E6EK3S,"*SPOILER ALERT* Overall I liked the film and have watched the dvd more than once already.  There were things that I was disappointed with in this film and things that I really liked.  I'll do the disappointments first.

First, I didn't really understand the need to add Barty Crouch Jr into the beginning scenes.  Maybe they wanted to ""help"" the audience along with figuring it out, but to me it wasn't necessary.  One of the best parts of the book was being completely surprised at the end when I discovered that Mad Eye Moody wasn't really Mad Eye Moody.

Second, I didn't like Michael Gambon's performance as Dumbledore.  He deviated way to much from the way Dumbledore is described in the book (his yelling and pushing Harry after his name comes out of the goblet, for example).  I can't help it, but even now when I re-read the books, I still picture Richard Harris as Dumbledore.

Third, I know they have to condense a lot of information into a two hour movie, but I would have liked to see a couple of the subplots from the book added into the movie, like the Dursleys, S.P.E.W., Blast-ended Skrewts, Dobby and Winky, Ludo Bagman, or more on Rita Skeeter.

Last, the Maze.  Although I thought what they did with the maze was kind of cool, it was MUCH better in the book!  I would have loved to see Harry turned upside-down, the Sphinx, and the giant spider!

The Good Stuff:
I thought this movie did a great job of adding some humor!  Snape slapping their heads was great, as well as the ferret incident with Mad Eye.  They did some good stuff with Filch and the Yule Ball too.

The special effects were the best out of all four of the movies.  They did a great job on the dragon and the underwater scenes.  All way better than the werewolf from Prisoner of Azkaban.

Last, I thought they did an excellent job with Voldemort.  Ray Fiennes was perfect.  They didn't make him exactly like described in the book, but in the special features they explain why they chose not to do the red eyes for Voldemort and it does make sense.  I thought the whole graveyard scene was really good.

My overall rating is a good one.  As a book reader, movies are almost always disappointing, but I love the story so much that I can get past the movie changes.  This one is well worth the money, but definately get the special edition.",1142380800,,2323,4.447867298578199
2505637,5,B000E6EK3S,"This movie was certainly excellent, but I don't think it deserved a PG-13 rating anymore than the next movie. Yes, it was darker, but not SCARY. The scene that sparks the controversy is Lord Voldemort's Rebirthday Party occurs. Yes, Wormtail does chop off his own hand, but you don't see anything and all you hear is him gasping. He doesn't scream or shriek or anything. Voldemort is tipped nakedly into the cauldron, but we see nothing but his upper back and neck. The only part which is rather violent is when Voldemort, reborn and restored to his body, touches Harry on the forehead and he yells. Being a male, when Harry screams it doesn't sound bad, mostly it's just ""Aaaaahhh owwww ahhhh owwww gaspgaspsighsigh"". It actually made me angry, to see Dan in pain, even if it was only pretend.  Overall, the only other violent part was when Harry is thrown over some rocks by a dragon's tail. The mermaids are definitely not Ariel, and as such are rather frightening. Mostly their voices more than anything else. There is no sexuality or anything, except for when the camera zooms in for all of 2 seconds on Beauxbatons(rival school) girls' rear ends. Ron says ""Bloody hell"" about 3 times, ""Piss off"" once, and Harry says ""Damn"" and ""git"" once each. A ferret crawls inside another boy's pants, and the boy's friend reaches in to get the ferret out. It's presented in a comical way so I don't think it was a problem. Of course, Harry(portrayed by Daniel Radcliffe) is growing up and as such, there is a scene with him ina bathtub. Nothing from mid-stomach below is shown, but still, the female members of the audience I was watching with all sighed happily. Myself included. ;-)",1142380800,,1678,4.688135593220339
2505638,4,B000E6EK3S,"This is the one of the best in the Harry Potter movie series that I watched so far.  It is filled with excitement, tense and good moments.  For the story, since it is pretty much followed by the novel.  It is no doubt to say that it is good.  For the acting, they are always good just like before.  They never go a step backward.  One of the surprises is Katie Leung, she acts very well as her debut as Cho Chang.  For the direction, it is very good because the movie itself is perfect.  For the visuals, this movie has the best visuals among all the Harry Potter series especially the prom scene.  Great visions!  For the music, it is good because it is tense and that can fill the excitement.  Also, the music from the prom scene is my favorite because it is quite relaxing.  For the sound effect, it is the best of the rest because since the movie itself is good, it is good also with no doubts.  Overall, it is a good movie and it is one of the best movies in 2005.  It is totally a good recommendation.

Disc 2 comments:

Usually, as a lot of people do, after the movie ends, they will watch the theatrical trailer to remember back the overall highlights in this movie.  For this, I am a little disappointed because it is kind of short.

But I'm not sure I will rewatch this one very much.  The actors gave great performances (although I have to say Ralph Fiennes' portrayal of Voldemort was nowhere near what I expected.  I also found Michael Gambon's performance as Dumbledore to be out of character)

2505640,4,B000E6EK3S,"In this 4th installment of the Harry Potter series Harry finds himself entered in the tri-wizard tournament at Hogwarts.

 I overall enjoyed the movie thoroughly but there were definity things missing that should have been included, like no time at the Dursley's, and not enough time between Harry and Sirius.  I realize that to condense a 800 page book down to two and a half hours is very difficult but the producers of the film added things that I thought were not necessary and were not in the book.

  The book was by far my favorite of the series although all of these books sucked me into the J.K. Rowling's world which in my opinion is the sign of a great book. The movies did this for me as well and I hope to continue to enjoy the 5th, 6th, & 7th movies as well.

  I whole heartedly recommend seeing this film but keep in mind that if you loved the book the way I do things will be left out of the film that were in the book.",1142380800,,936,4.184357541899441
2505641,5,B000E6EK3S,"Alas, the two-disc special edition DVD has arrived and here I am, watching the movie again, with mixed feelings regarding the DVD.

Speaking of the movie, it was excellent. 100 stars. The best Harry Potter movie yet, effectively morphing the franchise into something more mature and dramatic. Cinematically, the movie does not fall short of giving us fans what we want: action, adventure, lots of magic, and great cinematography. Mike Newell really dove into how each of the characters were growing up as students, leaving childhood behind forever. The movie was also very tightly and cleanly executed, making it seem shorter that it really is. Every frame felt important in the overall context of the movie and Mike showed great art in using elements of light, smoke, fire, and scenery to generate breathtaking captures. Acting-wise, the actors stepped up their game yet again, delivering stellar performances. Hermione's teary moments felt genuine and Harry's sobbing in the final scenes seemed natural, not awkward and forced. Ron was still funny as usual. The new cast were added well, giving each of them sufficient screen time to be explored. The suspense and the slight hints dropped here and there regarding the next books were exciting to watch, too. Over all, Newell's boarding-school take on the movie was amazing, making the franchise soar even higher than ever. Indeed, as the credits roll, we know that everything is about to change in the world of Harry now that Voldemort has risen again.

DVD wise, it was amazing. Not as amazing though, than the Prisoner of Azkaban DVD, which featured great documentaries. Don't get me wrong. This DVD has interesting featurettes but Prisoner's documentaries were more indepth and interesting. The deleted scenes in the Goblet DVD were great, as always, and the games were somewhat fun to play despite clunky controls. What I missed were interviews, which for me, are integral to how Prisoner the DVD was a little better.

What was missing, too, was a conversation with JK. Personally, JK's inputs in the previous DVDs were the featurettes that are my favorite. It is interesting to know what the creator of the franchise feels about where her creation is being taken and so, I missed that and was mildly disappointed that JK did not make any appearance in the DVD. If she was there, that would have been great.

Overall, 5 stars. I mean as a DVD in itself, it is jammed-pack with excellent material compared to other DVDs around, which would only contain very little extras. Goblet of Fire the DVD is worth it. Go ahead and purchase it...",1142380800,,2591,4.949425287356322
2505642,2,B000E6EK3S,"While everyone else is talking about the direction and editing of this movie, has anyone noticed that the picture quality on DVD is much worse than you would expect from a blockbuster.  I expect that they cut costs in manufacturing.  I remember when everyone was saying the DVD/CD was the greatest next thing because it would not break and could store vast amounts of information.  There was poor picture quality and pixelation the first time through on this Harry Potter 4 DVD. Its like guns, guns don't kill people, people kill people. In this case, poor DVDs don't make pixelation; manufacturers who won't make quality DVDS make pixelation problems. Shame on them!",1142294400,,667,4.9375

2505645,2,B000E6EK3S,"I didn't get the chance to see the movie in the theater, but I got the regular (1-disk) DVD, and watched it in hopes of a pretty good movie. I was sorely dissapointed.

The script cut out so many scenes and bits of information, that I was furious by the time the movie was over. From what I remember of the book, compared to what I saw in the movie, I would say about 50% or possibly more of the book was cut. I understand the need to cut out pieces so the movie can fit in a decent time frame. That was done with all 3 previous movies. But they flowed well, had a balance of what was left in and what was taken out to still be understood, and follow the underlying currents around the main storyline.

In ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"", the script was horrendous. From the beginning, there is very little of the Quidditch game, when what happens at the game sets the tone of the book. You don't see any muggles, who are supposed to be floating in the air later by Death Eaters, who then scatter when someone sets off the Dark Mark in the sky. Harry initially has his wand taken from him from where he is sitting in the stands, and Fred and George make bets with Bagman, who later seems disturbed, especially since he owes some Goblins. Throughout the book, Harry, Ron, and Hermione see Fred and George trying to talk to Bagman or get their money back from him. After the event, Harry, Ron, and Hermione get separated from the rest of Ron's family, and are supposed to see the Dark Mark. Plus when Ron's dad and the rest of the Ministry appear to apprehend whoever set off the Dark Mark, Harry points over to some bushes, and Crouch's house-elf Winky is caught holding Harry's wand, which is tested and it is proven that his wand made the Dark Mark. Crouch gets embarassed/upset and boots Winky from his home.

There is no mention of the visitors from the two other magickal schools before they make their theatrical appearances, and you never see any of the school classes. Also in this book, Hermione is supposed to start her crusade for the freedom of the house-elves, and Dobby (previously Malfoy's house-elf) has semi-befriended Winky, and Winky's ramblings help Harry and his friends realize Mr. Crouch and his family has quite a bit to do with what is going on.

Also, yes they introduce Rita Skeeter, but in this book, Hermione can't understand how Rita is writing stories about incidents she couldn't possibly overhear, such as when Harry's scar hurts him in Prof. Trelawny's class, and after the second task when Krum is sitting with Hermione and pulls a bug from her hair after asking her something about keeping in touch with him. Hermione finds out Rita's secret, and catches her, which has quite a bit to do with the fifth book.

Also, they only show Mr. Crouch dead, they never show Harry finding him, and Mr. Crouch out of his mind, and they never show Percy (Ron's brother) coming to be a judge for the Tri-Wizard Tournament. They also never have Ron's mother and siblings show up to support Harry for the 3rd Task (the maze).

Finally, near the end, once Harry returns with Cedric's body, they never show Fudge getting frustrated with Dumbledore, and incessantly insisting that there is no possible way You-Know-Who could have returned, Fudge giving Harry the gold for winning the Tournament, Harry giving the winning galleons to Fred & Geroge for the creation of their joke shop, and Dumbledore asking Mrs. Weasley and others to help Dumbledore spread the word that Voldemort's back. So when you see Dumbledore talking to Harry and saying that ""hopefully people will do what's right and not what's easy"" you would understand the reasons behind him saying that.

There was so much left out, that I felt it almost defeated the whole purpose of creating this movie in the first place. This book/story is not just about the Tri-Wizard Tournament. It is about so much more, and the parts missing tie into the fifth book, if not the sixth and seventh probably as well.

I don't know what Warner Brothers, J. K. Rowling, and the director were thinking about when creating the script and making this film, but I am horribly dissapointed and upset. If you only want to watch this movie for the extras and the fancy CGI Graphics, then by all means buy it. But if you want something that feels like the book, and you can see in your mind as you're reading the book, then I doubt you'll like this.

People, CGI graphics and 3-4 action sequences do not make a movie, and I feel that is what this is, deplorably. I would willingly watch a 3 to 3 1/2 hour movie if it had more of what is characteristic of J. K. Rowling in it. This didn't have it.",1142294400,,4658,4.502958579881657
2505646,2,B000E6EK3S,"Well, we knew he would win. Little suspense, except the film was so dark I found most of it hard to see and I was therefore bored out of my socks.  Excellent acting by the cast the CGI may have been great if I could have seen it.",1142294400,,229,3.7708333333333335
2505647,2,B000E6EK3S,"Yes, yes, there were too many subplots in the book and not enough time for the movie to relate them.  Yes, yes, the film needed certain other scenes either stretched out or created to set the mood.  But the acting - or what might pass at a high school pageant as acting - left me laughing in embarrassment.  Michael Gambon seemed particularly over the top (even worse than Prisoner). What's happened to Dumbledore's calm and cool and all-knowing demeanor?  Did he not get his cup of coffee that morning? This performance certainly gives one a much deeper appreciation for the late, great Richard Harris. And it felt like the Emma Watson and Rupert Grint's characters were reading from a teleprompter.  Special effects only go so far.  At some point in time a decent screenplay and credible actors become necessary to create magic.  And what's distressing is that the first two films had all three - eye catching effects, great acting and a storyline that paralled closely to all the books' pertinent plot lines, not just the good versus evil angle.  I say bag Mike Newall as director and go back to Chris Columbus.",1142294400,,1114,4.7357512953367875

2505659,4,B000E6EK3S,"I am a huge Harry Potter fan and literally jumped to order the DVD the week before it came out. I have read all of the books and love them! With that said, read Book 4 first, or else you may find yourself a little bit confused on some things throughout the movie, some of the characters, and some of the plot points...BUT this film is a VISUAL FEAST! The effects, the sounds, the characters....SUPERB! If you've seen the other three films, you will love watching the how the young actors have grown up, and following their coming of age.

The actors have grown in age and acting ability as well.

You'll love the film (even if you haven't read Book 4) if you love a great adventure story, though you won't be clued in as to what a lot of things mean. For Harry Potter insiders, you will be on the edge of your seat with giddyness, eager to see how they transfer the beloved images in your head onto the silver screen ( I know I was), but you will also be a little perturbed at some of the things that they cut out! Winky the house-elf's part in the story in particular (which I think was relevant) and other aspects as well. But as the films do seem to change directors for every movie, this may be the reason...Each director's vision is different, as well as the screen writers...

2505660,5,B000E6EK3S,"I was worried about how they could possibly condense the 870 pages of the fourth Harry Potter Book into one movie, but Director Mike Newell did very well. Yes, they left out some major storylines, but they captured the essence of the book. I have always thought that Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) was the weakest of the three main actors, but in this movie he really comes into his own and doesn't seem as coached as he always has in the previous films.

Things I really liked about the movie were the opportunity to see the Weasley twins play a more prominent role, the extremely spooky maze scene at the end, the intense scene at the graveyard at the end, seeing Neville develop as a character, and seeing Harry become more of a regular boy goofing around with his schoolmates. There's also a delicious scene with Rupert Gint (Ron) waltzing with Maggie Smith, and a devilish portrayal of reporter Rita Skeeter by Miranda Richardson, and some wonderful comic moments involving Malfoy and Snape.

Things I did not like-- the poor actor playing Albus Dumbledore is absolutely no substitute for Richard Harris, but then, nobody would be. I'd like to have seen some of the actual World Cup Quidditch match at the beginning of the film, and I'd like to have seen how the other champions conquered their dragons. There was also an extremely clumsy bit of scene cutting during the ball when Hermione suddenly yells at Ron that he's ruined everything for no apparent reason. We are left to surmise that he did or said something to Viktor Crum, Hermione's dance partner, but we don't really know.

Nevertheless, this movie is a delightful adaptation of the book. mike Newell and all of the actors did a superb job of bringing the book to life.",1142294400,,1730,4.702970297029703

Also, there was plenty of action, nice special effects, a couple of appropriately creepy bad guys (Ralph Finnes), and a satisfying ending.

So...as long as you're not looking for a completely faithful renditon of the book (or for a ""Citizen Kane"" level of filmaking), you'll probably find this to be satisfying entertainment for an evening.",1142208000,,546,4.797872340425532
2505662,5,B000E6EK3S,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the best in the series, so far. The books are amazing, and the directors have brought them to life on the silver screen, but Goblet of Fire stands out. It is the one that follows the book the best. Director Mike Newell (FOur Weddings and a Funeral) is the first British director in the series. We have had One American Director (Chris Columbus---Rent; the first two Potter Films) and a Spanish director (Alfonso Cuaron---Mi Tu Mama Tambian, Prisoner of Azkaban), and they might have done an amazing job, Newell is the best for the series to date.

  Here is the brief 101 of Goblet of Fire. Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) school, Hogwarts for those who are not Potter fans, holds the annual Triwizard Tournament. In this tournament, three schools, including Hogwarts, must participate in this event. One from each school is picked for these gruesome events to win the Triwizard cup. The age limit is 17 and older, but someone puts Harry Potter's name in the Goblet of fire, which they needed to put their name into and it would decide, and it was not Harry. Ron (Rupert Grint) does not believe Harry when he is chosen as one of the four, there was only supposed to be three, but Harry's name was chosen as well, so he is jealous of Harry. Hermione (Emma Watson) is worried about Harry. He now must [articipate in the three challenges: dragons, an underwater event, and a ""killer"" maze, whome he comes upon Lord Voldemort.

  The film is the best in the series. The rest of the cast includes Robbie Coltrane (Dumbledore), Ralph Fiennes (Lord Voldemort), Michael Gambon, Brendan Gleeson (Mad-Eye Moody), Alan Rickman (Professor Snape), and Maggie Smith (Professor McGonnagal). The film is, of course, based on the fourth novel in the Harry Potter series written by wonderful author J.K. Rowling, who invents such a magical world of excitement, mystery, and wonder.

  The DVD (2-Disc Set) includes a look into the challenges of the Tri-Wizard tournament, deleted scenes, concersations with the cast, a preparation for the Yule Ball featurette, and much more! Steve Kloves translates the book into the wonderful screenplay that it is.

  ""Terrific entertainment. Fueled with endless invention,"" says Roger Ebert for the Chicago Sun Times. I agree with him. The film runs at a lengthy two hours and twenty-seven minutes, but it is never boring at any part of the film. The 2-Disc DVD is the best for the fans, while the single-disc DVD only included the film itself.

  Now i see why it is rated PG-13, because it had to be. The film conquers the role of the best fim adaptation from a book, and the book was pretty action-filled and violent at times. The film, and the book, are both amazing spectrums of work that will leave the reader or watcher gasping for more!",1142208000,,2804,4.764462809917355

Even though it's disappointing when there are things from the book that are left out of the movie, I think they did a pretty good job of portraying the story - since the book is so long and for them to leave in every detail would create a very long movie.

You can only get it if you buy the ""Special Edition"" DVD - and it happens to cost twice the price of the non-bonus editions! That's a change from all three previous films in which bonus material was standard in all versions of the movie. I think it's a rip off and a jerk move by Warner Bros. (or whoever's in charge of this kind of thing). They should know by now that people are willing to spend money on the Harry Potter franchise. Why try to take us for all we're worth? Because I for one bought the REGULAR widescreen edition, assuming that it would have bonus material, and I think many others did, too. I didn't even know there was a ""Special Edition"" until I saw a commercial a week after I bought it! So now I have to buy it again just to get bonus material that probably isn't worth the extra $20+. So if you haven't bought it yet, and you care anything about special features, then I suggest you save your time, money, and frustration by buying the ""Special Edition"" version first.

Did we really need to waste so much time watching the Weasleys walking through the woods or climbing up all those steps at the World Cup? was the Yule ball really that important to the plot that so much time was devoted to it? What was up with the dragon getting loose and chasing Harry all over Hogwarts? Why add long scenes that didn't even happen in the book? or why drag out scenes (the bathtub scene) that could have been kept short so other scenes could have also been included? I would have preferred that they had spent a little more time working on the screenplay to make a more cohesive film that made more sense. It would be hard to cut the book to a 2 1/2 hour movie but I think it could have been done much better and made more entertaining. The Weasleys getting stuck in the Dursleys fireplace would have been great. The movie needed more of the magic and delight present in some of the other movies.

2505673,4,B000E6EK3S,"The 4th installment just seem to go by really fast. So much that happened in the book didn't happened in the movie (I don't mean S.P.E.W) And the fact that there were events happening ahead of other things (Sirus meeting up with Harry before he meets up with Hagrid) There were also changes in the movie but nothing major - most of the changes played out well into the movie. Or at least just got to the point.

I can't say that I was very thrilled of the outcome on the 4th movie. I was hoping for more. This one just seemed so focus not only on the tournament, but also on the attraction between the guys and girls.

The one thing I was very disappointed about was the fact that the god-father (Gary Oldman) was barely in the movie. I kind of hoped they would of given him a lot more scene's; not just one or two that's barely 5 minutes long.

BTW, what happened to Lord Voldemort? he looks nothing like the one in the first movie. Nothing remotely close to the book's describtion -- where are his ""red eyes""?

-----------------------------------------------------------------

The only reason why I gave this movie a 4 star is because of the action in it. Like the first and second task were, to me, very similar to the book. And the Yule Ball was just amazingly beautiful.",1142121600,,1276,4.459227467811159

Obviously, there is not enough time to fit all of the book into two hours, but I did feel that other than the Tournament, there was so much missing. All the characters next to Harry were just secondary. Even Ron and Hermione didn't have very significant parts. In a way, I feel that they focused on all the wrong areas. Still, the special effects are nice...

As far as the DVD goes: I chose to buy this non-special feautures version, because it is less expensive. I got this DVD at Best Buy and saved a whole $10 by getting this edition.

The bonus material is nice, but if you've watched it once, are you reallly going watch it again? Additionally, I have the bonus feautures from the first three movies and they're all pretty similar.

In conclusion, this is a nice movie to have in your collection regardless.",1142121600,,975,4.466292134831461

That said, this movie was a major improvement over the 3rd film. In Goblet of Fire, they at least followed the plot line reasonably well. However, the cutting out of most of the beginning of the book was rather disappointing. On the positive side, the characters (especially Harry Ron and Hermione) really developed in this movie. Also, the Triwizard tournement was just as good as in the book other than that they took out much of the 3rd task. Overall, this is a good movie, but realize that it isn't the same as the book.",1142035200,,720,4.5038167938931295

What you fail to realize, is that the movie doesn't form a coherent plot, unless you've read the fourth book.  So, the book fails on two fronts.  As a movie, it isn't coherent enough to be considered good.  Too much time is spent on things that aren't crucial, while crucial events are extremely undercovered (see Chapters 1-12).

As a movie replicating a book, it miserably fails.  All can agree.

2505678,2,B000E6EK3S,"The previous movies, especially the first, were very good adaptations of the books.  The movie adaptation of the Goblet of Fire, however, is very poorly done.  It's a major disappointment.  It appears that either the director,

producer(s), or screenwriter(s)(or all of them) were not up to the task of making a good movie or were simply intent on cashing in on the financial success of the previous movies and books by simply going through the minimal motions to release an ""adequate"" movie, knowing very well that Potter fans will pay to see and buy the movie regardless of its deficiencies.

The movie does provide impressive glitzy special effects and the actors continue to perform well.  However, the movie corrupts and deviates from the theme and storyline found in the books and previous movies.  The movie also has the central characters in the movie behaving ""out of character"" from the thousands of pages that have been used to develop their characters and personalities (and previous movies, too); for example, this movie has Dumbledore running around ranting and appearing to act impulsively.  Anyone who has carefully read the books knows that the essence of Dumbledore is: calmness, thoughtfulness, and a cool logical mind (like Sherlock Holmes).  It makes it appear that those involved in the production of the movie either don't care about being true to the story or characters, or have never read the books, which in either case indicate this movie should have been titled ""The New Changed (Fast Money Maker) Version of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" (loosely based on some book by ""JK what's her name"").  The movie should bring the original story (the one found in the book) to life; instead, this movie sucked the life out of the original story and substituted a vaguely similar but flawed story in its place.

This movie should and could have been very good.  Instead, the one chance to produce a great movie of a good book has been squandered by what appears to be the rush to cash in on a successful franchise.

Please do two things: first, if you absolutely must buy this movie, don't buy it new; I'll be selling mine at half price on eBay, along with many others.  I don't want to encourage the production of poor movies.  Second, go the Harry Potter website and let JK Rowland know you want the next movie to be true to the story and characters she worked so hard to develop.",1142035200,,2407,4.766265060240964
2505679,4,B000E6EK3S,"The Harry Potter series reaches a very promising and exciting new level of quality entertainment.

I've grown accustom to the moments in the Harry Potter movies that I don't really understand, because they probably explained themselves better in the books... which I haven't read... and probably should. Okay, so they just used an old BOOT to travel to this festival in the middle of a field... I've learned to accept and move on... don't think to much about it... just enjoy. That's the key.

Sorcerer's Stone was refreshing and exciting to see such a fantasy unfold on film. Movies like this are what FILM is all about. Chamber of Secrets kept with the story. Wasn't incredible, but was AS GOOD as Stone.... but PRISONER OF AZKABAN, lost me... and was my first clue to the fact that there was a lot going on in the books that was just being grazed over, mention, unexplained and unexplored in the films.

PRISONER was... well, not so good, Random events, no structure and not a very interesting story. I could only hope that GOBLET OF FIRE would change that... and turn the series in a proper direction... and it did.

GOBLET OF FIRE is a true adventure and it had a nice, set STRUCTURE that made it a worthy film and told a worthy story, although an unfinished story, but a worthy one. The previous films were like the STAR WARS series... in a sense that... they just weren't as good... UNTIL DARTH VADER entered the picture. Once DARTH VADER came and there was A REAL AND PRESENT DANGER, the series became interesting... again.  The same goes for the HARRY POTTER movies... without LORD VOLDERMORT, it just isn't AS INTERESTING.

Well... he's back... and unfortunately we only get a small dose of his power and danger. Which makes the wait for film #5, that much more anxious. Which is my only complaint about the film.

GOBLET OF FIRE is an outstanding film that challenges the imagination with scares, excitement, dragons, mazes, deceit, heroism and real danger which always make everything more interesting. Yet, I'll only give it 4 stars because they keep frickin' teasing us! Stop with the teasin' and give us VOLDERMORT! Stop with the teasin'. Am I wrong... or is the most drawn out story in the history of STORIES!

Fortunately though the film version nicely captures the bulk of the book from the exciting Tri-Wizard Tournament(The dragon chase scene is terrifically realized in this film)and the scary climatic return of You Know Who. Part of the fun of the books is experiencing the characters growing up and the same goes for the film version. Remember way back when when Harry and Hermione were just little tykes running around in big robes?Now that they're teenagers the movie tackles young love leading up to a nicely done dance ball sequence. As always this film has great special effects but nicely balances them with mystery and humor(There's a great scene where Ron's teacher tries to show him how to dance).The ending is pretty intense with an actual murder that might frighten the very young but if you've read the books you'll know there'll be much worse to come in the future... As an avid reader of the Potter series and fan of the movies I still feel each book and each film is better than the last and Goblet Of Fire is the best Potter film so far!,1142035200,,1174,4.5424528301886795

Though I'm used to seeing books not done well by screen writers, I was really quite shocked how much they cut up the book. Omitting rather important characters is screwing up the plot developement. Many things go unexplained, & do not make sense, please JKR, if you have any input, get after them about this in future films!!! The special effects as a whole were good, & the ending was in tune with the darkness the books as a whole are heading. I did miss the well known theme music.

2505683,3,B000E6EK3S,"After watching the GOF with my kids, albeit skipping the scary scenes, I came to realize one HUGE glaring omission from the movie and that's the compelling music score of John Williams. In Azkaban, I remember a flute tooling around as we came into a conversation with Harry and Lupin on the bridge, or the music when the class learns what a Boggart is with Lupin, meeting Sirius for the first time as a wolf, etc... As in ALL the Potter films except this one, we have a force behing the scenes that helps propel the movie, but not in GOF? Even the opening credits all but eliminate the main tune.  As for the plots, the elves should have been given some due, as they do play a role in the upcoming Phoenix and Half-Blood books, moreso than in Goblet. Dobby did little screen time in Azkaban, but it was effective and made sense-- let's keep the elves!!! If there's anyone who wondered how they crammed the first 1/4 of the book into 30 minutes, devoting so little time getting to and then at the Quidditch World Cup, and next we're welcoming the Beauxbatons to Hogwart's, and why, please tell me???  We had a dragon flight and fight, and Sirius in the firepit, two scenes totally made up and done for added drama; we don't need to make things up with what's written in the books. What makes the first 3 so magical, is the finer points that they get right; chocolate frogs, spiders, dementors, characters. It's all in the details, and you don't need to include ALL of them, just those that matter most, and this is where Newell, or the screenplay writer, or both, are missing their marks. As for Dumbledore, I was sad to see no immersion into the true character by Michael Gambon (a fine actor) as in the book, and certainly not in tune with the character when he shakes Harry; very much not like Albus at all I'm afraid. This is where I miss the talented Sir Harris in the role from the first two movies. All in all, good action, most times in step with the overall element of the book, but not the best; that still goes to the Azkaban movie, which I still watch over and over again. Let's just hope that the relative newcomer David Yates can bring back the magic and sense of wonder that GOF seemed to be lacking, not be afraid that it's a long movie (that's what Director's Cuts are for :))  As I commented on the Lord of the Rings trilogy, where Jackson wasn't afraid to give us 3 hours plus on each film, he did it because of character development, plot lines, underlying themes, and details and I don't think anyone will doubt it wasn't worth it!!! The next three should take this cue and provide us with an exciting end to what will be the most memorable of all movie characters and stories of all time put to film.",1141948800,,2721,4.373517786561265

2505697,4,B000E6EK3S,"In ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"", young wizards Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione (Emma Watson), and Ron (Rupert Grint) return to Hogwart's School of Witchcraft & Wizardry for their 4th year. The year begins under a cloud, as Voldemort's disciples, the Death Eaters, become more daring by unleashing his ""Dark Mark"" at the Quidditch World Cup extravaganza. But Hogwarts is brimming with excitement because the school is hosting the Tri-Wizard Tournament in which a representative from each of three European wizarding schools will compete for great glory. Any student 17 years or older may enter his or her name in the Goblet of Fire, which chooses the contestant from each school. From Hogwarts, it chooses handsome Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson), from Eastern Europe athletic Viktor Krum (Stanislav Ianevski), and from France lovely Fleur Delacour (Clemence Poesy)....and from Hogwarts Harry Potter. But Harry isn't old enough. His name could not have been entered. But there it is. So the school year begins with a new Defense of the Dark Arts teacher, Alaster ""Mad Eye"" Moody (Brendan Gleeson), and the challenge of the Tri-Wizard Tournament.

""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" was the book in which the Harry Potter series took on a notably darker tone. The previous movie, ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" turned dark too soon, ahead of the books. But this film follows the mood of the book by becoming increasingly menacing as Voldemort's power grows. The events of the World Quidditch Cup are understandably cut very short here, but I was a little disappointed not to see more of this grand event, since it created perhaps the most vivid imagery in the Harry Potter series. As a reminder of how much people change during puberty, I could have sworn that Neville Longbottom, Ginny Weasley, and Draco Malfoy were played by different actors in this film than in the previous movies. But they're not. The actors are 14 or 15 years old now and bear scant resemblance to their childhood selves. It would have been helpful had Fleur been made to look ethereal, as she was described in the book. She comes across as a simple dumb blonde here. And the Weasley boys' mop-top hairdos are, um, ill-advised. Fred and George look like women. But Miranda Richardson's portrayal of tabloid reporter Rita Skeeter is not to be missed. Director Mike Newell hits the right notes, making Harry's 4th year adventures into an entertaining film that prepares us for the wickedness to come.",1141948800,,2499,4.9928057553956835

This movie could have been as bad as the the previous one.  Yes they took out some very, I believe, key scenes, but at least it followed the general outline of the book.  Azkaban jumped all over the place and lets not forget the shrunked head!

Don't get me wrong I am a huge Harry Potter fan and yes I am an adult, but I think that most people tend to forget that these books are geared toward kids and young adults.  If these movies were made to be seen by adults only then maybe a lot of the key elements of the movie (i.e. school and dating) wouldn't be played up so, but remember a lot of the people seeing these movies are going through the same things.  I think J.K. goes to great lengths to show us the teenage side of Harry and his friends and being in school or dating are all very teenage things.  Remember he's only 14 in this movie.  What were you dealing with when you were 14?  Yes, Harry has this whole other part of his life that is scary and very real, but he also has to deal with the same issues the rest of us did/do.  I think that is why he is so lovable.

So after all the ranting, I have to say that I think the director and cast did the best they could with the amount of time they had.  I personally loved the movie and I think it's the best one yet.",1141948800,,1397,3.95

He will face off against the Proud Victor Krum of Durmstrang School of magic, the fair Fluer DeLacour of Beaubaxtons magicical institute and his fellow student the popular Cedric Diggory.

'The Goblet of Fire' is the best in the saga by far. The tagline says...'Everything Is Going To Change'. As the climax of the Harry Potter saga, the film was true to its word. This movie is far from the previous three. It has a PG-13 rating, ranging hormones and very disturbing ending. Still what made this movie so amazing was the work that was done to finally bring to life the one character that every fan has been wondering and waiting to see. Of course I am speaking about the Dark Lord Voldemort. Casting Ralph Finnes was the perfect choice, because he knows how to be the villain as you have seen in his previous work. His performance left me speechless and the fact he didn't even get nominated for a supporting actors Oscar shocked me...well at least Jake Gylenhall didn't get it either. Also the adding of Miranda Richardson and Brendan Gleason was also great. The regulars of the cast also did a fantastic job.

What made me so happy about this new movie was the writers and new Director Mike Newell really looked at the past films and now thanks to the disaster of Azkaban, the right things were cut and added, the bonds of friendship were forged again and the cast finally played the correct rolls rather than just standing there for comic relief. As this first piece of the story comes to a close the stage is set for 'Order of the Phoenix'.

I think what left me cold the most about this film was the real lack of screentime given to Krum, Diggory, and De La Couer.  They were pretty enjoyable characters in the novel, and to see them only getting a line or two each was quite disappointing.

Unlike many of the reviewers here, I really did enjoy the movie.  I was not sad to see the demise of the house elf, I'm not Rita's bigest fan and thought that whole plotline really drug the book along, and was glad to not have to spend much time dealing with Percy.  I'm pleased, overall, with what was removed (with the notable exception of what's mentioned above).  It made things less convoluted, to be honest.  I only need so many twsits and turns in a two-and-a-half hour film.

I thought the overall theme of this film worked very well.  The kids are getting older, and it shows in the way they played their parts.  I really felt the chemistry among the kids (I'd better after 3 films!), and I didn't really miss all the interaction with the staff this time around.  In any other installment, it would have created a gaping hole; here it gave the folks who made the film less to worry about and focus on the big picture of TGoF, which really is the kids and their maturation.

I enjoyed Durmstrang and Beauxbatons, and do regret that we didn't get to see more of them, but I thought the producers got a good feel for each school and handled them properly.  Ok, not so thrilled about the ""Beauxbatons Butt Shot"" (watch the film and you'll see what I mean), and I also thought their Headmasters were as well-played as could be expected.

I was worried about seeing this film, but overall a good job.  I do think there will be some problems in the future due to some ""set-ups"" being missed in this film, but that's two or three years down the road and I'll worry about it when the time comes.

Hagrid and Professor McGonagall seemed to be relegated to the background and the scene of Harry talking to Sirius in the fire was not realistic looking. Not too crazy about Michael Gambon as Dumbledore; the late Richard Harris was much better in the role.

While I didn't find GOBLET OF FIRE quite as entertaining as the preceding films, it certainly is well made and the three youngsters (Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint) are certainly maturing as actors.

Director Mike Newell, not known for doing action type films, uses an almost too lethargic pacing at times, focusing on the growing pains of the adolescents as they start thinking about the opposite sex.  Meanwhile, the special effects are awesome, the art direction superb, and the musical score soars.  The plot is a little too complex at times and some things aren't fully realized, but we do get Brendan Gleeson as the dark wizard; Ralph Fiennes as Lord Valdemont and the deliciously wicked Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter, the journalist with the need to know.  I wonder sometimes how Rowlins plans to continue milking what is basically a one note premise (the return of Valdemont and Harry's continued wizardy).

First of all, I just got a job af ew months ago, so I have a lot of money on my hands and the first day it came out, a few days ago, I went to my job (store) and bought it.

Wrong idea. Make SURE to WAIT FOR THE 2 DISC. I never ever buy things single disc if there's a 2 disc, but I didn't care this time, I just wanted to see the movie again. There were absolutly no special features. The movie didn't have a good feel anymore because of the fact i knew it was basically just the movie on dvd. I assumed the single disc would have at least SOME features, like a trailer or anything, but it didn't. I didn't want to wait a week to go to the mall to buy the double version which is why i bought this one, and that's a mistake.

If you like Harry Potter movies and books, DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION. Buy the double disc. If you just liked this as a movie and aren't a huge fan of HP, buy this version. It's cut and dry and to the point.

5 stars because of the fact that I can return this impulse buy for the double disc and get almost all my money back overrides the fact that i didn't like this version and that the movie was great.",1141862400,,1247,3.840466926070039
2505722,1,B000E6EK3S,"The movie is needlessly dark and violent. For instance, we didn't need to see Voldemort chop off Wormtail's hands. The filmmakers seemed to have forgotten these are children's books. In fact, the problem, bizarre as it sounds, is that the director didn't understand the source material. For him magic is whiz-bang carnival tricks. But in the books magic is an everyday thing for the characters, not a fourth of July celebration.

Victor Krum looks like he's about 30 years old. The Durmstrang boys all look significantly older the Hogwarts boys. The Beauxbaton girls are dressed like Swedish flight attendants. Fleur is a seductress in the book but in the movie she's a plain-looking girl who only gets to speak once. Both of the schools enter to cheesy choreographed routines that look like they came from Cirque du Soleil. And was it really necessary to have a gratuitous shot of the girls' asses to let us know the boys were all worked up? It's more than a little skeezy objectivifying 14-year-old girls.

The director is not at all comfortable with special effects. The underwater and maze scenes are just awful. You can see better watching any Saturday morning cartoon.

Rita Skeeter added nothing to the story and only served to show up every so often to bring the plot to a screeching halt. Miranda Richardson vamps it up so much that her words take on an unnatural cadence. What results aren't even sentences. She totally, totally missed the mark. Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort and Brendan Gleeson as Mad Eye Moody are both excellent.

2505724,3,B000E6EK3S,"This movie was okay. It lacked a lot of the elements of completeness that the other movies had, but then that fault may lie with the fact that they keep switching directors, and picked a lack-luster composer (patrick doyle) for the film.  As the series goes on, I've found myself less and less interested to what happens to the characters on screen.  I suspect moviegoers are now going to go see the next Harry Potter movie just to see how it turned out, instead of a genuine interest in the actual movie.

I was also disappointed to find that now, for the first time in the series that the movie makers are charging extra for the two-disc version, calling it deluxe.  In the past it was always deluxe.  Although I usually just watch the movie, dedicated fans/customers should not have to pay 30 dollars for what was the orginal format.  This is a rip-off and the movie makers and manufacturers should definitely be slapped with a dead fish.",1141862400,,941,4.571428571428571
2505725,5,B000E6EK3S,"Whoa! Potter is a big teenager, and there are no childlike scenes here. I want to say I appreciate the one reviewer that reads the books but only pointed out things from the book that probably should have been included to clarify some things. They are very valid points. At least she did not give us a blow by blow why the movie wasn't the book. I will probably get some negative votes because I am fed up with some book reviewers reviewing movies as though they are the same medium. The movies can no more be the book than the book can be the movie. Once you understand that is not possible you will begin to appreciate the fact that a great deal of effort goes into bringing the ESSENCE of the book to the big screen. As well pointed out unfortunately sometimes the screenwriters, directors, etc. don't get it right and there is something missing that should have been included from the book. The movies are all great and this one certainly is almost as good as the others. Harry must once again prove himself to his friends and the school.

This time in a Tri-Wizard contest which he didn't even volunteer to be in. How was he selected? But that is only the beginning of questionable things happening. There is a bit more friction between him and Ron this time. But then considering their ages and the competitive nature of school, is it any wonder? The characters are further developed and the storyline is incredible. The special effects in the magic scenes are excellent. By far the scariest, and not for small children as some scenes are very intense. He must battle not only formidible creatures but his own mortality as well and watch the death of a friend. It will keep you guessing who he can trust to the very end. What struck me most is how much the people playing the characters, and the characters too have aged and matured. As in the books this story is definitely darker than previous ones. I highly recommend it for the adults, but not children and I am sure Rowling would tell you her books were never meant for young children. A bug being tortured, child morphed and tormented, Harry almost drowning, scary mermen attacking, a girl dragged underground by plants, and a young man being killed is not for the faint of heart. A must if you have the other three, but not  as lighthearted as the first two and even darker than the third.",1141862400,,2352,4.492990654205608
2505726,3,B000E6EK3S,"Making a great book into a great movie is very challenging. The toughest thing being having to out do the imagination of both the author and the reader. Peter Jackson did it in the first two 'Lord of the rings' films before it all fell apart in the finale (But then again so too did the third book) but so far the Potter films are basically 0-3-1.

GOF is the best of the Potter novels IMO, and now the best of the Potter films. That's not saying much, however. The other movies, well intentioned and slick as they are, are rather dull and flat translations of their written counterparts. The kids look like how the characters are described. The world looks like it should (Aside from the sometimes dodgy CGI), But for some reason the films lack the charm, heart and wonder of Rowling's novels.

GOF is not so much a giant leap, but a small step forward. At times it's even mildly thrilling, but I challenge any true Potter fan to say that they've managed to capture the books properly on film.

The extras here are mostly kid stuff (Appropriately so) It basically plays like promotional material for a film you already own.

All in all GOF would be just another forgettable kiddie adventure film if not for it's source material. My advice for true Potter fans... Skip the movies and re-read the books.",1141862400,,1302,4.527659574468085
2505727,4,B000E6EK3S,"Goblet of Fire is very enjoyable; the special effects were very well done, and although it is fast paced it is enjoyable enough to be a pleasure watching more than once.  They made good use of every frame, stuffing in as much content as they felt they could.  Of course they had cut a lot out from the book, but the heart of the story is still intact; there was nothing left out that was crucial to the plot.  The only exception to this is at the very end, when something that happens in the book is not mentioned at all in the movie.  It does not create a problem NOW for this film, but by not mentioning it they are going to force the makers of 5 to waste valuable screen time explaining what happened to their key witness!  (Some argue that neglecting to make Rita Skeeter and animorph will also effect future films, but I don't see a problem in the film format just having Hermione ""convince"" her to interview Harry again without extending the film to explain how and why.  Skeeter is a fun character, but a minor one not so critical to the story line.)

As for the DVD, I am apalled at the direction Warner Home Video has gone by releasing two separate editions.  While some people may appreciate the movie-only edition, to me this defeats the entire purpose of the DVD format--extras!!  Many stores are taking advantage of the dual-format to charge full price for the movie only, and a higher price to the special edition.  Kudos to Amazon for keeping their prices in line with ""normal"" DVD pricing.  Most of the extras were enjoyable, if nothing unusual; however, as usual the games are boring (why do they bother?).  And one other way Warner Bros. decided to save money at our expense was to leave out the paper insert with the list of chapters and specials disk directory.

Interestingly, though, the first two films suited the ages of the protagonists.  The third was an unfortunate misfire, but this one is a mature film, combining the best of scoring, acting, effects, editing, and story line.

Michael Gambon is a casting win, since his acting alone should have earned him an Oscar nomination.  No one else in recent memory delivers the intent of the lines with as much substance and nuance as he does.

Also key to this film's success is its ability to draw the audience into the story more than any of the others.  The book may be a good inspiration to the screenplay, but in the final analysis is not relevant to the merits of the film, since the film delivers on its own, as it should.

I like the darker direction they are going in and the actors are really growing into their roles.

But this time, they gave Full Screen viewers the shaft- there's only 1 disc, and no bonus features at all, not even audio commentary!  And they charged about the same price.

A proud Harry Potter fan - of both the books and the first three movies, I can only hope to wipe away as much of my memory of this fourth movie as one can.

I understand that video is a different type of medium than literature.  I even understand that movies have to take a certain liberty in order to portray the many imagined scenes of books.  What I Do NOT understand is why you need to spend over two hours of my life showing me what you can do with a large budget.

The point of the Potter books is that they are kids books with an entertaining story line - that focuses mostly on the characters and little on the world.

Most of the movie consisted of special effects and very little talking.  The story did not cohere.  The end was the same as the begining and the middle.  And the best acting job was done by Voldemort. I always felt the rest of the actors did a good job in the previous movies - however it seems the director of this movie only wanted them to make faces and occasionally yell a line.

They didn't even tell the story.  It jumped from one scene to the next without even explaining ANYTHING!  I only hope that the 5th movie can redeem this one.

On my list of Craptacular movies this is definitely #1, it is even worse than Star Wars Episode 2(clone wars), Rocky V, and The Punisher.  In fact I would prefer to watch Season 7 of Buffy 3x through rather than have to watch this horrible interpretation of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.

I'm going to have to reread the book just to forget this horrible depiction.",1141776000,,1644,4.174603174603175
2505742,3,B000E6EK3S,"Not having been able to see this movie on the big screen, I ran right out and got The Goblet of Fire, and watched it right away.  Thanks to the comments of a like-minded friend who had seen it in November and my own cognitive abilities, I did not have high expectations, but I confess I was still a bit disappointed.  This was the first HP movie that really felt like it was being marketed to a certain age group (preteen-teen), and it had none of the artistry or of the continuity of the storyline of The Prisoner of Azkaban.  The movie used cliches--scary hallways, poor lighting, everyone (at Hogwarts, anyway) dressed in black, etc.--so instead of feeling fresh it just fell flat for me.

Usually I love Patrick Doyle's music (he did Emma Thompson's Sense and Sensibility), but here I missed the pizzazz of John Williams's scores.  In another comparison with the earlier three movies, I'd have to say the brevity of Alan Rickman's part of Professor Snape was yet another feature that made HP4 fall short of being a movie that I will watch again and again.  I have yet to watch the deleted scenes, which I am hoping will flesh out the story a bit more, but the whole movie felt like it was chopped to bits in the editing room.

How the heck is Warner Bros. going to make a 2.5- or even 3-hour movie work for Order of the Phoenix?  I would hope they get Alfonso Cuaron back for that one, or find someone else of his caliber.  Good luck, Steven Kloves (screenwriter)--I cannot even imagine the Herculean task of manipulating such a long and involved story into a cohesive screenplay.  Perhaps Warner Bros. could consider begetting the biggest TV event in history and turn HP5 into a six-plus hour miniseries a la the BBC's Pride & Prejudice?

If I could have done, I would have given the movie two and a half stars, but I erred on the generous side as that option is not available.  It is still somewhat enjoyable to ""catch up"" with the characters as they race through another year at Hogwarts, but (to fall back on a cliche, myself) the book is so much better.",1141776000,,2062,4.469333333333333

The movie did an excellent job of capturing all of the excitement and thrills that the book had. You come away not at all disappointed.

But if you are looking for an adaptation, you'll come away a bit disappointed. So many events and so much back story just had to be left out that it leaves those in the know explaining things to the moviegoers. If you're an arrogant cuss like me, that's a fun place to be. But if you have someone constantly asking you ""What's happening? Why did that happen?"" it might get a little tiresome.

Enjoy the movie for the movie and smile and all the fun scenes that you know are coming. And maybe, just maybe, the next movie will be two movies, a part one and part two, that way we can get more of the story mixed with the action.",1141776000,,1008,4.212435233160622

What gives Warner the right to charge an extra five or six bucks for special features?  No, seriously.  This DVD is JUST the movie.  Nothing else.  If you want the extra features you have to buy the ""special"" version, something new for the Harry Potter series.  It's funny, I don't recall having to pay extra for special features on the other Harry Potter flicks,  or any other new DVD releases either for that matter.  I guess Warner considers its customers to be pretty gullible and sadly when I see the ""Special"" version of GOF is in the top seller list I guess the underhanded tactics are paying off.

The movie is very good, though not my favorite, and I think it's because there was just so much to the film and it jumped from one thing to the next which left one feeling rather dizzy. I've read the book and realize it was a tremendously difficult task to try to encompass that tome into one feature-length film.  But also, it seems a little cheesy and schtick-y in some areas (Moody/Crouch's tongue-flicking, Karkaroff's overall portrayal, and although I love the true belly-laugh humor juxtaposed with the heart-breaking drama, it still just isn't my choice as number one in the series.

As for the dvd, I'm equally ""blah"" about it as well.  Nothing new to report here.  I'm an adult fan of the HP series and still waiting for WB to get a clue about their adult consumers.  The HP series has NEVER been solely for kids, but you wouldn't know it watching their extras.

There's the same old stupid games that will bore anyone over the age of 12 out of their gourd.  And there's not a lot in the ""goodie bag"" either.  Interviews with Dan, Emma, and Rupert, and some featurettes of how they did the sets, how they created the creatures in CGI, etc. etc. Have I just become jaded by watching hundreds of DVD extras?  The HP GoF extras just seem formulaic...I keep hoping with each new release (at least in the HP series) that we'll see something exciting, refreshing, intriguing....different...MAGICAL. And...nothing.

Yes, the interviews with the kids are interesting (I'm continually floored by how articulate Dan, Emma and some of the others are!) and it was pretty cool to see how life on the Leavesdon Studio set for HP is (as well as to see some well-deserved air-time go to the ""champions"" of the movie.  But there wasn't ONE interview segment with the adult characters of the film.  With their roles relegated to cameo-style appearances in the film I think WB owed it to viewers and the actors to include them in a special series in the extras, but no.  No Maggie Smith, no Robbie Coltrane, no Michael Gambone (and where was he on #3?).  But SHAME on WB for TOTALLY ignoring Brendan Gleeson and virtually ignoring Ralph Fiennes.  I mean, COME ON! It's Voldy's big debut and just one little featurette?

In particular, I was rather impressed by the inclusion of the three forbidden curses.  I don't remember their names, nor do I believe in magic, but for both Secular and Religious/Spiritual audiences they teach very valuable lessons:

1. It is evil to forcefuly control someone or submit them to your will (given that they are not trying to harm you or themselves).

2. It is evil to cause someone undue pain and/or suffering.

3. It is evil to take someone's life away... It is evil to kill unjustly (If you want to get into what actually justifies killing another human being, read ""Atlas Shrugged"").

These lessons or ""truths"" run throughout the series but are here revealed cleverly during a classroom lecture so that the author can express a facet of her philosophical beliefs, leaving little room for literary misinterpretation.

Like I said in my review's title: I don't know why people have recently written bad reviews.  The film had depth, took its subject matter seriously (and rightfully so... but don't let the young ones watch it, it's much too dark) and was well executed/produced.

2505757,2,B000E6EK3S,"While it is a given that any large book requires some trimming to be adapted to an movie of acceptable length, this latest installment in the Harry Potter series comes across as badly truncated and poorly edited.  There are too many gaps in the story/action, as well as a few holes where a scene was obviously deleted.  Nor is there any real sense of a whole term passing - with the jarring exceptions of the Yule Ball and End of Term, the action could have all taken place in a matter of days, not months.  Also, some of the effects were sloppily exectuted, with Voldemort's ""nose"" being particularly irritating in the frames where it looks like a bad eraser smudge left on the print.  Even the song ""Magic Works"" at the end of the credits grated - too often off key or screeching.

It's time for the producers to consider lengthening the run time and adding an intermission to the remaining films.  It will perhaps cut out one performance a day at the cineplex, but in the end will benefit total gross.

2505758,3,B000E6EK3S,"Strangely enough, watching this movie on the bigscreen for the first time (& even again on dvd) gave me a very similar feeling I got watching another film of an 'English Bent' on the bigscreen - The most recent adaption of 'Pride & Prejudice'.

Both stories are most wonderful excellent books, and both would most likely also make for excellent 'extended series' or 'extended directors cut' editions...  But neither somehow seems QUITE exactly suited for a slim, tightly edited 2-hour movie.

  Fortunately for those that may like 'Pride & Prejudice' - there IS a most wonderful BBC mini-series, which is virtually perfectly cast (least to my mind - and certainly FAR better than the film version in that respect), and tells the story far more in full detail & pace.. filling all the missing or far-shortened plot-points, and adding a great deal of depth, character and 'heart' to all the characters that I found oft missing from the much-condensed bigscreen film version.

If not for having seen that BBC edition of 'Pride & Prejudice' beforehand, or having twice previously read the 'Goblet of Fire' book before having seen THIS film...  I probably would just BARELY know what the 'heck' was going on from either of these stories from just trying to 'piece it together' from the respective film versions...

Unfortunately, Potter 4 Does not (as far as I know) have an extended or 'directors cut' available (other than simply reading the book of course) - so this is all we're likely to expect from this movie.  And even though it does it's best to 'hit' most of the  major plot-points, has a talented likable cast (I like them anyways - though I DO still sorely miss Richard Harris), and has some great special effects throughout...  It's brisk pace, and leaving out of a great deal of the books secondary plot points and details just left me feeling kinda 'cold' as I left the theater.  I felt a great deal of the 'heart and soul' of the book (one of my favorites from the series) and it's characters was sorely missing from the film version. It even came across as a bit 'patchy' to me... which the third film, though also missing a fair bit from the book, never really did - It held together and flowed in its own way..  (which made me enjoy it APART from the book - as it's own seperate work.)

One other thing that annoys me here that I'd like to mention, (which was also a factor in the third film) was the much condensed - if not outright MISSING 'ending explanation/talk' of events in the books between Dumbledore & Harry (Harry & Lupin in the 3rd film)  Dumbledore's simple few words of ""Well you know Harry, your parents can't be brought back to life"" line in answer to why they appeared towards the end of Harry's battle with Voldemort was very dopey and frustrating to me.  Considering this wasn't even the longest film in the series so far (though it easily SHOULD have been) I can't imagine why they couldn't just tack on ONE or two more minutes and have the FULL explanation involved. (Which would have also maybe helped the rather so-far missing 'chemistry' between Harry and (Michael Gambon's) Dumbledore...)

Even more perplexing was the third film's (being the shortest)  leaving out the explanation and history behind the 'Marauder's Map'... and the role of Harry's father in it, & why Harry's patronus took the form of a stag.  (It would have only taken an extra minute or two... but again it's simply left off....  Strange.",1141689600,,3447,4.694352159468439

This was by far a very dark Harry Potter and definitely not for younger viewers.  This film came very close to earning an ""R"" rating and I have no doubt they had to do some extensive editing to prevent it.

Besides the ""blood and guts"" aspects of this film, I found it to be the most boring installment yet, even more boring than #2/Chamber of Secrets.  There is a long period in this film where absolutely nothing important to the story happens.  We see a tiff break out between Ron and Harry that lasts for quite some time in the film and ends without reason.

There was a lot of hype in the film itself about how dangerous the Tri Wizards tournament would be, yet we found the tournament wasn't dangerous at all, it was quite dull by HP standards.  The only dangers were to Harry Potter in the background story which had nothing to do with the tournament itself.

Poorly scripted and weak on story, the production company has but two choices: quickly get the next installment out so viewers can forget about this travesty, or wait a long time for the next installment so this one can have time to die it's own death in the minds of those who were unfortunate enough to sit through it.

When young actors are growing up as fast as these are, you really can't afford to make mistakes like this movie.  Any later attempt to fill in the missing pieces can only be awkward, at best.  One actor said, in one of those pre-release tv info-mercials that there was enough in the book for two movies.  I agree, and they should have made two or even three movies to keep the storyline.  For those of us who read the books, it is extremely difficult to see how anyone can even attempt to make movies of the following books with all the basic information that is missing from this movie.

Take this movie for what it is, another fun and exciting chapter in the Harry Potter MOVIE franchise and not a page for page rendition of the book. I strongly feel, given that the producers didn't want to split the 'Goblet' into two films, that this was as close to the book as they could make it. The major portions of the book, what will be important for the following movies, the relationships, the overall plot, were maintained. Now that the books exceed three hundred pages, more than double them actually, it would be unfair for us to compare. We're dealing with seven hundred pages being whittled to roughly one hundred and fifty pages of script, a minute per page. What could and needed to be put in, was, what could regrettably be cut, was. Just know the movie is fast-paced, interesting, and a lot of fun to watch unfold. There are greatly improved perfomances, new cast members that completely capture their character, amazing scenery, and just as amazing cgi. I don't feel many people could sit through a film, any film, that is much longer. Just think of Titanic. The English Patient. Forget craft.

2505779,1,B000E6EK3S,"Well, Everyone seems to enjoy taking this opportunity to voice their opinion about all sorts of things so I'll start by doing the same!  First, 467 reviews for a DVD that hasn't been released yet has got to be an Amazon record.  Second, it's painfully obvious that some people have way too much time on their hands and submit multiple reviews.  Just read all the ""A Kid's review""s for example- I think most are from the same person- and I doubt a kid.  Too many comments that just don't sound like a kid at all.  And I'm not fooled by the juvenile remarks and misspellings. While I'm on the subject, read all the 5 star reviews and ask yourself if the reviewer really liked THIS movie and DVD, or if they just obviously like all things Harry Potter.

I am a real person and I have just seen this movie.  I rented it to see if I would buy it like I have the others.  I will not be.  I wanted to like it, but sadly it is terrible.  And it's not got anything to do with the book or the other movies!  A movie should be able to stand on it's own even if one has not read any of the books or seen any of the other movies.  And it's there that this movie fails the most.  Unexplained characters, unexplained dialogue, unexplained plots.  Actually, if you simply read the description of the movie as posted in this listing, you can save yourself the time as that's pretty much the movie.

I liked all three of the other movies, but this one really has me scratching my head. I could barely follow it: bad edits, short scenes, unexplained scenes and too hard to understand British accents!  Other characters that you may know from the other movies are barely seen, and Harry's friends are now simply annoying.

Now all you Harry Potter die hards can write your review now & tell me off, but that's my opinion and I'm entitled to it!  If you haven't seen the movie: you have been warned.",1141603200,,1878,4.286931818181818

  The charictors skipped were not all that important.  Not even the house elves.  The  Yule ball illistrates that while our main 3 can face dark wizard the oppisit sex is another and much more frightening thing  altogether.  It has just enough comedy to keep it from being a dark film.  and it keeps to the story fairly well.

 The one thing I'd have put more time into is at the tournament the first apearence of the dark mark in the sky.  The fact that Harry's dropped wand was used to put it there & the significance of it.  Anyone who hasn't read the book would be totally confused by that.  It also served in the book to illistrate that the ministry of magic goes steeply downhill for the rest of the series from there on.  So I would've extended the movie by about 1/2 hour to thoroughly explain the dark mark.  It really is pertnant to the story.  otherwise highly enjoyable.",1141516800,,1025,4.25
2505782,4,B000E6EK3S,"At the theaters the story was way to hard to follow. It went way to fast. After taking weeks to read the book it is so dissapointing how the movie turned out.

I guess you can't have your cake and eat it too.  Some people say they left to much out some say it goes too fast.  I think it is both. The reality is that it would have been a great 6 hour movie.

I read in an interview before the movie came out that the kid actors were all getting better with their acting skills as they mature.  Unfortunately you wouldn't notice. There's not much more than one liners, and all the dialogue has been cut to make way for the action parts.  There isn't much ""acting"" at all.  These kids did way more acting in the first three movies.

I understand that this book's pace changes a bit, but the movies pace changes drastically.  If you did not read the book you will be lost watching the movie.  The pace of the movie leaves so much unexplained they assume you can fill in the blanks in your own mind.

I can't wait till I get it on DVD though, I'm hoping it will feel slower because I have allready seen it.

Don't get me wrong I'm still a huge fan. I still loved this movie. I'm just spoiled by the pace, depth of the characters, and charm of the first three.",1141516800,,1254,4.094262295081967

The movie was first of all to consecutive it started off with alot of action and didn't slow down it had the feeling of just wanting to hit the main points in the book and not have feeling to it. This reduced its abuility of being a good movie if one looks at all the great movies in the world one would see that they are always full of emotion.

Second the over all movie didn't stay as true to the book as I would have liked. First of all they left out Bagmen. Who played a decent role in the plot and was a rather entertaining character was completely left out. This changed the story slightly though not much so it can be excused.

Third they left out Doby the house elf (insedentaly one of my more favorable characters)this changed the plot in the movie a little more than Bagmen. But this in turn leaves out the house elf Winky. Which in turn leaves out S.P.E.W (this in the book gave depth to Hermione""s character). But I can understand why they left it out.

However on the other hand it was a very well done movie and the visual effects were quite good along with the acting and the writers didn't mess with it so much that the story didn't make sense.

I would definatly say go see it.

2505787,5,B000E6EK3S,"Finally, a Harry Potter movie from a British director with an authentically British sensibility!  This is not the book, folks, it is cinema - British cinema, not an American kids' movie with British accents (read: Chris Columbus's two failed attempts).

Although I am an American myself, I am an avid fan of British cinema and television, and therefore was very comfortable with the style of this movie.  Some American fans less familiar with British cinema might take issue with the fast pace, the plopping you right into the story without preamble and leaving you to fill in the gaps with your imagination, but at least it does not insult the viewer's intelligence. In this it is very like Rowling's writing - smart, fast, witty, with the best parts hidden between the lines.  No longer episodic and choppy, this very streamlined Harry Potter movie moves with great pace and utterly fantastic detail, almost magically capturing the essence of a 740-page book, and doing it very, very well.  In much the same way that Peter Jackson captured the great spirit of J.R.R. Tolkien without giving us a carbon copy of the book, British director Mike Newell adapts the hefty novel into a beautiful piece of authentic cinema.

At the same time, this is not Cliff's Notes - the book is rich and complex in ways the movie cannot be, so read it and savor it.  The movie is its own work of art, seperate from the book, to be appreciated on its own merits.

After a disconcertingly bad beginning, young Daniel Radcliffe has become quite a good actor, although I credit a lot of that to Mike Newell (and blame a lot of his earlier failure on Chris Columbus).  Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, both naturally good actors, are still excellent.  In the hands of a British director, these kids are finally allowed to use authentically British dialogue, not Americanized or slowed down so foreign ears can understand the accents, and it makes a world of difference to the believability of the film.  That being said, foreign ears probably will miss some of the dialogue unless they're very finely tuned and paying close attention.  My ears are accustomed to it, and I loved every second of it.

I was also pleased to see wonderful British actor David Tennant as Barty Crouch, Jr., and of course Ralph Fiennes is absolutely perfect as Voldemort.  Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody and Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter are both brilliant new additions.  I would have enjoyed seeing more Jason Isaacs (just because) and more of the legendary Warwick Davis, though his role is necessarily slight.  Another bright light is young Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom, wonderfully and compassionately portrayed by both actor and director. Pay close attention to his role; it is deeper than it might seem.

The only complaint I can make about this movie is Moaning Myrtle.  I realize they've kept the same cast from previous movies, and that's commendable, but surely they could have made an exception.

Overall, A+

The selection ceremony for the Tri-Wizard tournament was humorous. The look of shock on certain characters faces is unforgettable! The tasks are fun and exciting even though I already knew what was going to happen! I thought that the Yule ball was absolutely spectacular, and Ron's dress robes were awesome!

However, that being said, I got the distinct impression that Mike Newell was afraid of using CGI characters (mainly Dobbie), thereby changing a lot of the book unnecessarily to eliminate or minimize its use.  I realize there's no way to fit 700+ pages into a 2 1/2 hour movie, but staying at least close to the original story would've been nice.

I hope the director of Order of the Phoenix has actually read the book and plans to stick a little closer to Jo Rowling's story.",1140998400,,594,4.192982456140351
2505818,4,B000E6EK3S,"Much darker than its predecessors, ""Goblet of Fire"" takes Harry and his friends into a darker corner of the wizarding world.  There are dragons, mermaids, a wicked maze, a new Dark Arts teacher(of course!), and something that hasn't been in the first three films so far--death.  Without giving away too much, just know that ""Goblet"" takes the viewer straight into the wizarding world, leaving out the Dursleys, trims up the book that it is based on and attempts to give the viewer the meat-and-potatoes version of the novel.

The acting is superb, perhaps the best of the film series.  Daniel Radcliffe has grown quite well into his role as young Harry Potter, who is only beginning his years of teenage angst.  Emma Watson has blossomed into a lovely young lady, but Hermione is still just as prissy as she was before.  Rupert Grint has grown up more than any of the other characters both physically and as an actor.  He has a solid handle on Ron.  His twin elder brothers, Fred and George, get a little more spotlight in this film, and Oliver and James Phelps prove to the crowd that they are solid comic performers in this story.  Ginny Weasley(Bonnie Wright) returns in a supporting role.  Robbie Coltrane gets big and tall as Hagrid once again(but in a smaller role).  Of course, Draco(Tom Felton) and his gang are around to torment Harry, but they take a backseat to the Tri-Wizard tournament.

Other returning characters include Dumbledore(Michael Gambon), Snape(Alan Rickman), Flitwick(Warwick Davis), and all of the other teachers from Hogwart's, not to mention Jason Isaacs as the wicked Lucius Malfoy.  New characters include Brendan Gleeson as Mad-Eye Moody, Miranda Richardson as the hilarious Rita Skeeter, Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort, and Katie Leung as Cho Chang.  Three pivotal new characters, the Tri-Wizard competitors, are also introduced in ""Goblet.""  They are first-time actor Stanislav Ianevski as the athletic Viktor Krum, the lovely Clemence Poesy as Fleur Delacour, and Robert Pattinson as the honorable and trustworthy Cedric Diggory.

The story moves at the fastest pace of any of the films so far.  There is some rather rough-and-tumble editing at points in the movie, but you have to give the director, Mike Newell, a mulligan for that considering the length of the book it is based on.  The special effects have greatly improved, and are nearly flawless.  Newell moves the story along at a smooth and quick trot, making the nearly two-and-a-half hour flick move along nicely.

This is definitely the darkest film so far.  Folks who brought their young children to the first three films should preview this before allowing their youngsters to watch it.  A good film to measure this against as far as the PG-13 rating goes is any of the ""Lord of the Rings"" films.  If your child can handle that, they can handle ""Goblet.""

*Potential Spoilers*

The death of a prominent character may make this film a little tough for youngsters to view.  Definitely watch the last thirty or so minutes of this film without your child before they can see it.  When Voldemort makes his return, he is a grotesque creature, and Wormtail(Timothy Spall) quickly extinguishes one of the major characters in this tale.

Also, the language is a tad bit stronger on this film than in the others.

The opening sequence at the Quidditch World Cup comes to a violent end, so you might be wary of that before letting your youngsters view as well.

Other than these particular moments, most of this story will be no worse than the other three.  This is an all-around good film, and I don't mean to take away from it by listing these few moments.  However, I don't think that my daughter, who has viewed the other films, should see the ending of this film until she's a little older.

The enchanted candy is gone, this is a darker and more violent Harry Potter.  Still, I highly recommend it to fans of the books and the films, as well as anyone who enjoys fantasy flicks.

Highly recommended.",1140912000,,3989,4.841949778434269

2505820,4,B000E6EK3S,"I'm a fan of the Harry Potter series, I've got all the books and read Goblet of Fire twice the day before watching the movie, so i could catch up on the plot I've probably forgotten. Generally, I think it was pretty good, but again, there are reasons that I took away one star.

Most of us read the book either before or after watching the movie. The plotline has the best ingrediants for a movie compared to the past three and probably all after it, with new characters like Krum and Fleur and Cedric Diggory, with flying though no Quidditch, drangons, and the Dark Arts. The start of the movie is arranged in a way similar to the book with that Frank muggle person getting killed, which made me think that they'll follow the plotline the whole way through, but the movie ended up taking a lot away and putting a lot in. I know that there are many pages in this book, but when the young Barty Crouch took the Veritaserum (the potion that makes you peak the truth), the death of Barty Crouch Sr. wasn't explained properly, and some things were also left unsaid. I've heard people complaining about not understanding the story, and I won't think otherwise if I haven't read the book beforehand.

The movie had new jokes-- the plus part is that people who read the book are going to see fresh things, the minus part is that there are funnier jokes closer to the character's character, you know what I mean?

They also added a bunch of things to catch the audiences' attention, unimportant things like the entrances of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang (I like the second one better) which I suppose is crucial in a movie, but leaving out important things in the plot for that? The scenes where all shot in a darker way like the Prisoner of Azkaban, which is acceptable and I still don't know why Australia rated it an R. Small things like giving the Weasley twins Triwizard money to open their joke shop and Fleur seeing Bill Weasley are left out, but they could influence the future movies.

Also, there is something to be said about a new character: I think Katie Leung totally destroys the part where Harry asks her to go to the Yule Ball. Instead of frowning so awkwardly through the whole scene, she has to look sorry because she already agreed to go to the ball with Cedric! Krum and Fleur should have more lines to structure their character, but I guess that couldn't have been possible.

This movie is a bit weak on the feelings,and a movie of mere excitement, romance and jokes just wasn't what I was expecting, but overall the movie is a great thriller just like the Harry Potter books. I hope the next movie won't follow this line, but if it's the best they can do...",1140912000,,2669,4.4722792607802875

2505822,5,B000E6EK3S,"The 4th Harry Potter movie is the first of the movies to earn the PG-13 rating..and it won't be the last.  They did a fine job of compressing the longest of the Harry Potter books into a movie.  The Dursleys aren't in the film (I was looking forward to see that Ton Tongue Toffee scence in the movie), and Harry has finally discovers girls. That's right, Harry and Ron truly discover that Hermonie is a girl.

  The Triwizard Tournament takes place at Hogwarts, and Harry is looking forward to it...until his name comes out of the Goblet Of Fire and joins the tournament.  The tournament has 3 tasks of which the four champions must face.  The first task is to get a golden egg from a fierce dragon.

  But that's not all what's happening.  Harry has dreams about Voldemort.  Rita Skitter could've been more threatening in the movie than she is in the book.

2505823,3,B000E6EK3S,"JK Rowling's Book Four was as fabulous as all the rest, unfortunately the film version turned out a great deal of choppy editing and some personal scenes that were so deeply compressed that we rarely had a chance to enjoy them before they were gone. The extra scenes provided on disk two add background and texture, particularly when Alan Rickman (Snape) is present.

Emma Watson is a wonderful actress and the Yule Ball gave her a chance to shine...but... it seemed to me that as Hermione, her pitch rarely varied, mostly shrill and shrill (believe me, I love the actress, but I know she has a greater range than what appeared on screen). Fortunately, we were saved by the time that was given to the Weasley twins, by Miranda Richardson's artfully wicked portrayal of Rita Skeeter and by Rupert Grint's (Ron Weasley's) comedic flair. Other highlights via actor Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter), were the bubble bath egg sequence as well as the dramatic closing scenes with Harry's enemy Lord Voldemort.

To the Director of Film Five...Enough money has already been made that you can successfully convince the studio to extend the time of the next film to at least three hours. If someone thinks that the audience can not sit through three hours, then they don't understand their audience. Come on, give the next film the time that it deserves and listen to the screenwriter..work together to give us scenes that have not only the excitement required, but the small moments between friends that are full and complete.

""Return of the King,"" the third theatrical installment of the Tolkien trilogy was taken from a book of 512 pages. The film, a total of 3 hours and 10 minutes, garnished many Oscars, including Best Picture and Best Director. Described by the entertainment industry's big mag, Variety, as an ""urgently paced 200-minute film without an ounce of fat,"" the film proved that most theater goers were happy to sit in their seats for three hours.

One last thing, please, I beg you, more light. Dark and darker is unnecessary and boring. It isn't dark that's better, it's the contrast between light and dark that's better. Please, don't make me feel like I'm watching an unlit version of MTV. Good luck, Mr. Director, this is YOUR TriWizard Tournament.

2505826,4,B000E6EK3S,"This review is for the THEATRICAL VERSION, as the Special Edition DVD is not released yet.

There was a lot of debate at the beginning of this project concerning the options of making this two separate films, going long [there was talk of a 3-hour film], or just trying to lump it all into one feature-length film and be done with it. I must say, I was hoping for 2 separate films, although that would hold up the franchise from its nice, even flow, and prolong the release of Book/Movie 5 (the Order of the Phoenix). I don't think I would have minded that sacrifice just to have a comprehensive chapter of this saga.

I also must say that I was a bit put off by Mike Newell. I mean...Pushing Tin, Four Weddings and a Funeral, and Donnie Brasco? None of those were my cup of tea. In fact, I don't regularly drink tea.

There were things left out, nuances from the novel which went unused, and whole ideas/parts of the original literary work which were entirely ignored.

SPOILERS!!

Fleur was not nearly as saucy as the novel portrayed her. There was no giant spider in the labyrinth. Neither was there a sphynx; a creature I was highly anticipating, by the way. After seeing the treatment of the hippogryph Buckbeak in the PoA, I was certain the sphynx would be completely AWESOME. No sphynx/sphinx. And also absent was Hermione's campaign against the abuse of house-elves known as ""SPEW."" And, I must add that I was a bit...disturbed by the wardrobe choice for the Death Eaters. They were dressed as KKK members, but in dark robes instead of white. I realize this style of dress far predates the Klan, but in this day and age, it's the first thing to be brought to mind by that headgear. Perhaps this is just an American phoenomenon? Are the KKK not world-wide? Or was this intentionally done to demonstrate to the children that these are evil men?

I thoroughly enjoyed Gambon's interpretation of Albus Dumbledore this time around. He put more of himself into the part, and stopped attempting to ""do"" Richard Harris's Dumbledore. While it's NOT the Dumbledore from Rowling's work, I've come to admire his attempt in GoF.

Whether by natural aging or a decent dye job, Radcliffe's hair is darker in this installment, but oddly enough his eyes seemed to change from blue to green, off and on again, throughout the movie. Radcliffe's acting is maturing with him, but crying on demand seems nigh impossible for the lad. It could be that he's led such a sheltered and/or protected life that he's nothing upon which to draw that instantaneous grief many actors use to perform this task.

Fred (James) and George (Oliver Phelps) Weasley were suitably brought forward, marking their positioning for Movie 5 (OotP). Although Harry failed to hand over the gold coins won in the Tri-Wizard Tournament to the lads to begin their business, I'm sure the next director will make do with what set up was left for him, and find some way to incorporate that into the next installment. It's a necessary detail, in My opinion, which was totally left out of this chapter. It's needed, in order to maintain the continuous storyline between the cinematic attempts. Without that detail, there leaves a long, empty path which will remain untrodden in upcoming theatrical events. That would be highly disappointing.

We're shown for the first time how Neville reacts to the Unforgivable Curses, but not told why, as is appropriate. You don't learn until Book 6 (HBP) exactly WHY his reaction to Mad-Eye Moody's demonstration, was so strong.

Emma Watson (Hermione) was completely ready for this particular treatment. She was beautiful. Quite lovely and all grown up. I know her father must have felt SO proud to see her looking so lady-like, and without showing even the slightest hint of too much skin.

The best scene? For Me, it's a toss-up between Draco-the-white-ferret being tossed about by Mad-Eye Moody and Harry's scene with the Horntail.

(/SPOILERS)

But that is the end of my complaints. While that may have seemed like a LONG list, any and all other omissions went unnoticed by THIS HP fan, and those few small omissions which were noticed were obvious time-saving devices which in no way reflected upon the overall execution of this work.

A CNN reviewer stated that this film ""tries to do too much."" Well, in my opinion, it didn't TRY, it succeeded! It started off well, ran well, and ended well. There was not one moment of wasted film. Not one bad cut, not one lost second. From start to finish, there was meat and potatoes, but that's not all it gives its viewers. There are lovely bits of wonderful pastries and a fine dessert as well.

Aside from what was mentioned above, GoF was everything for which I had hoped. As promised, the dragons were superb!!! I would have loved to have laid eyes on the Chinese Fireball, but if you really want to see what it looks like check out The Noble Collection, where you can also purchase a sterling silver Time Turner!!

The performances were beautifully directed, the cast was perfectly chosen, and the only complaint I had whatsoever concerning the performance executions was that of Fleur. Clemence Posey was the perfect actress for that part, but for some reason, Mike Newell traded in her sexuality and self-possession for a ""girl-next-door"" personna. I don't know why he felt the need to alter that character in such a drastic way, but it just did not achieve what he meant to achieve unless that was to rewrite a whole new personality for one of the principle characters in this chapter.

Of course, it did NOT ruin the movie in any way, but it was a bit of a shock to see her so...tame/lame in comparison to the novel character I had come to admire for her self-possessed attitude.

But for book lovers everywhere, take heart. The story IS here. While some of the details were left off due to time constraints, and some of the lines were moved around due to contractual obligations, the meat of the story (and there IS a LOT of story here) remains completely intact.

By the way...did I mention that the dragons were AWESOME?! Okay. Just checking. The flying horses are so realistically layered, textured, executed, and presented! I couldn't take my eyes off of them! They were magnificent!

I can't WAIT to own this on DVD!

It rates an 8.7/10 and is, by far, the best HP movie to date.

I thought it was good and entertaing from the parts that they pick for the movie and its also good watching them grow up in to their roles each time a new harry potter comes out.

I know everyone has their own opinion but sometimes i feel like there are 2 types of people on amazon, the type who really likes something and the type who hates on everyone for liking it, not because they think its bad but because they don't want to jump on the wagon like everyone else and admit its a good movie...",1140739200,,1087,4.122641509433962

2505829,4,B000E6EK3S,"Originally to be divided into two films, part 4 was instead squeezed harder than an orange for juice. We all know everything in the book can't make it to the film, but the condensed version still needs to be complete on it's own terms.

While entertaining and funny, the entire film can be broken down into a half-dozen sequences: Prologue, picking the champion, first task, second task, yule ball, conclusion. Problem being that there's no flow, while only about ten-percent of the novel covered these events they become the entire film, and it's a hollow experience. The tri-wizard champions are just figures on the screen with no depth or personalities, the plot is just to get Harry to the end of the film. Mostly it's just one special effects sequence after the other with little story, plot or character to hold it together.

Now, the Ultimate edition is nothing more than a re-packaging with some extra bonus features,not an extended version like promised when the first two came out. So don't wast your money on it, buy the regular blu-ray for the same movie.

Cedric and Krum were amazing, Daniel was even better than usual, and Rupert was still funny. Emma was beautiful. I did think the film was a little fast-paced, but that's what I expect. Understand the amount of time they have to shoot the film isn't very long, and I'm sure if they could, they would have put in most (or everything) they didn't. I was, however, slightly perturbed that they had all the hype surrounding the Quidditch World Cup (and even built the stadium) only to use it for about 5 minutes onscreen. I don't know about the rest of you, but that was a bit of a letdown. I was all ready to see an awesome Quidditch match, and then... then chaos. Newell knows how to drive a project, I'll give him that. Another thing that annoyed me was that John Williams didn't do the music for this film. The new guy wasn't too bad, but I missed the usual stuff. But if there is one thing the HP people know how to do, it's build suspense.

The maze is so short and incomplete.  I understand that the book is very long.  So make the movie longer.  Why does it have to be 2.5 hrs or shorter?  And why select a director that knows nothing about action movies?  What has he directed, Four Weddings And A Funeral?  How does that make him qualified to direct a Potter movie?  This movie should have been 3.5 to 4 hrs long, if not longer.  If you leave out so many things from the book, it affects the later movies.  You have to continue to leave those things out or have a flashback scene just to introduce it.

If I haven't read the book and can tell that major plot points were left out, then everyone can.  The director did a poor job with this one, and I am glad he is not doing the next one!  With books this large, the movies have to be longer.  It's common sense.  I am shocked that Rowling approved this version of her book.  Why didn't she reject it due to losing most of its meaning?

This movie was forced, rushed, directionless, and very shallow.  Dumbledore would never grab and shake Harry.  That scene was like a Three Stooges show.

The dragons were truly awesome! This was by far the best of the movies, I think.

Okay...the GoF book is 734 pages, and the movie adaptation is a little over 2.5 hours.  Of course a lot of stuff was going to be cut.  Some of the cuts I was able to deal with (e.g., Hermione and S.P.E.W.).  Unfortunately, many of the characters (especially the other Triwizard champions) were severely underdeveloped as a result.

Giving Viktor Krum only two lines in the entire movie was inexcusable.  So was cutting out the entire Quidditch World Cup match.  The viewer isn't given enough reason to care about Krum, or why he became a potential love interest for Hermione.  He simply comes across as a dumb jock.  The movie should have shown a couple minutes of the World Cup match to show off his prowess, and little scene here and there of him interacting with Hermione (I was actually quite peeved that the didn't show her teaching Viktor how to pronounce her name).

The other champions were likewise poorly developed.  You learn practically nothing about Cedric or Fleur Delacour (who got the least screentime out of the four champions).  Fleur was simply another pretty face; they even cut the part about her being a quarter-veela (which was why the boys were swooning over her in the book).  And if I didn't read the book, I probably wouldn't have cared too much about Cedric's death near the end of the movie.

Even Ron and Hermione were mainly relegated to the background.  They didn't even use any kind of magic for the entire film!  It would've been nice to show how exactly Hermione was helping Harry (like with the Accio spell), instead of just having her simper and worry.  Ron seemed to be purely comic relief.

My other quibble was that the first task was WAY too long.  The dragon chasing Harry around Hogwarts was ridiculous.  They could've easily shaved off a good five minutes, and instead use that time for the World Cup match they DIDN'T show (can you tell that I was mad about that being cut out?)

Don't get me wrong.  I still enjoyed the movie; it did capture the spirit of the book pretty well.  And I was VERY happy to see the ferret scene (YES!)

Overall impression: Good entertainment, but read the book first.  That'll help fill in the blanks.  Three out of five stars.

3/16/06 UPDATE: I received the Special Edition DVD set last week.  I liked the interview with the Golden Trio, but it would've been nice if they had other cast member interviews, like in the PoA DVD.  The reflection of the fourth movie (which included sharing from other cast members) was a nice touch, but again, I wish they had more in-depth interviews with them.  As for the deleted scenes, they weren't worth it.  I'm not giving away all of the deleted scenes, but I'll just say that there was NO footage whatsoever of the Quidditch World Cup Match!

I'm also slightly puzzled at why there was a *seperate* Special Edition DVD this time around.  I'm sure that confused a few people.",1140480000,,2913,4.637964774951076
2505838,3,B000E6EK3S,"i'm a harry potter fan, obviously, but GoF (the book) only ranks 5th (out of 6 so far) on my scale; for various reasons. the movie only fares better becuz only 4 movies are out at this point...

let's start with the story compression: i know it had to be done, but c'mon, 2.5 hours? the LotR movies each averaged 3+ hours in their theater formats. they managed to convey the magic and substance of those books very admirably.. can you really say that the same couldn't have been done with this film? the first hp film was 2.5 hours and the book was only half as long... furthermore, the first 2 films were true to the books.. they were the books brought to life, which is what one WANTS TO SEE in this kind of fantasy story. the overall effect of cutting out so much of the story is to make it move too fast; face it, this film plays like a ""highlights of year 4 at hogwarts"" ..and let's not forget that substantial changes were also made. the final plot twist was completely nullified by including barty crouch jr in the mix at the beginning, it was extremely annoying. the extension of the first task served no purpose either, there was no point to it, just meaningless thrill seeking.. the removal of some subplots (house elves) and the partial inclusion of others (skeeter) doesn't make any sense at all; it's simply visuals without context: also annoying. this film could have been 3 hours long without any complains from anyone. it would have been much more fulfilling

the acting... for the most part, this was great, although the dialog between harry and ""cho"" seems very forced. the ron/hermione tension is very well done though. so much so that you have to wonder if they're completely acting. lol.. the barty crouch jr character was a good casting choice though. exactly what i expected. almost as creepy as cillian murphy in batman begins... mad eye moody was well cast as well.. i wasn't really a fan of fiennes as voldemort either, he just doesn't seem to fit the role, in my opion. but my biggest gripe here remains dumbledore. after sir harris, all other dumbledores seem like pale imposters. this one lacks the warmth and intelligence of sir harris. as another reviewer said ""his man handling of harry is most un-dumbledore"" .. JO, FIND A DIFFERENT DUMBLEDORE!

the visuals were outstanding. easily the high point of the film. i saw the film in regular theater and in imax, and the imax version was simply stunning. no complaints about the visuals here

overall, i think this film is weaker than Azkaban (which i gave 3.5 stars), despite the thrilling visuals. the story alterations come close to ruining it for me. the pacing is much too fast compared to the amount of information in the book. as i said above, it plays more like a ""highlights of year 4 at hogwarts"" than anything, not so much telling a story as showing the high points of that story. that might be ok for some, but not for me",1140393600,,2911,4.549618320610687
2505839,3,B000E6EK3S,"I liked the movie, but somehow I guess from all of the buildup to it I left the theater disappointed. It felt like we raced through it and that it was over too quick. Many things were left out of the movie that appeared in the book, but I'm not going to whine about that too much. I feel they should have stretched it to a three hour movie to add in more character developments of Rita Skeeter, Fluer, Crum, and Cedric. We don't get to know them and didn't feel the full impact of Cedric's death. Also Dumbledore is just weird now with all the bling he wears and his man-handling of Harry after his name is coughed out of the goblet was totally unDumbledore-like. That said, I loved the whole Yule-Ball scene especially Hermione's heartbreak. She is one to look out for in the future to be a great actress. All-in-all I'd give it three and a half stars, but maybe after seeing it again I will like it more. I can't wait for the special edition dvd!

This is coming from a big fan who is also a parent who has read all the books.",1140393600,,1028,4.191919191919192
2505840,4,B000E6EK3S,"Three hours!  What's wrong with that?  Yeah, I know they can't cram the whole big book into one lil' ol' movie, but heck,  they don't seem to be trying too hard either!  Make it 3, shoot, I could could sit probably for 3 1/2!  You know very well people will still pile in by the bucket load to see it!

  The actors are wonderfully cast (though Gambon is a little hyper for Dumbledore as he runs around in a dingy, gray nightgown throwing Harry against walls [trophy room scene] - at least they cleaned his finger nails for this one [note back to Fat Lady portrait scene in POA]).  I love Miranda Richardson.  I only wish she had more story in the film.  Seeing Hermione battle with her or catch her in a jar as a beetle would've been interesting.

  The film is still mystical and magical to a point but they really seem to be skimming the surface with these last two films.  (I really miss Chris Columbus!  He had the heart for it.)  The story of Harry Potter may have been born in the realms of childhood fantasy but Rowling has made it so real with the use of her details.  To leave out 90% of these layers from the only visual we have of her (and Harry's) wonderous world is throwing away something vital to future audiences who will shrug it off as a nice little flick but didn't make any sense.

  And, really -- how can you start a Harry Potter story without his miserable time at the Dursleys?  Also, I missed getting to see the Quidditch World Cup game!  I was getting pumped up for that when suddenly it was off the screen like -- magic.

  But, I'm a die-hard fan and as long as Dan, Em and Rupe are heading it (also Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman) then, well, I'm going to see it and buy it!  Even partially told -- Harry Potter is a fun and amazing story you've got to read and watch!",1140048000,,1797,4.193548387096774
2505841,4,B000E6EK3S,"After finishing the novel, I was extremely excited to see the film version of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.  I was very happy with the result as I left the theater.  There was just so much that happened in the book that could not be fit into a movie that wasn't 3 hours plus long.  The movie is 2 and a half hours long as it is, and that is with it missing a lot of stuff that happens in the novel.

The biggest missing pieces is the presence of the house-elves.  Winky and Dobby play an extremely important role in the novel, yet they do not appear at all in the film.  In fact, the group that Hermione creates, S.P.E.W., is never mentioned in the film, either.  I personally really enjoy the presence of house-elves in the novels, although I could see how some people find them annoying.  It just seems like there could have been a middle ground, and then they wouldn't have to be written completely out of the movie.

I guess the down side to trying to make movies out of a book like Goblet of Fire or Lord of the Rings is that so many HUGE things happen, that it is really tough to develop any characters other than the main, ultra-important hero/villain/sidekicks.  Specifically, the absence of any story whatsoever about Fred and George is a little disappointing.  Their constant disobedience and troublemaking in the novels is a welcome aside from the foreboding nature of the rest of the novel, and I think the twins are also a little underutilized in the movie, and they are turned into that classic movie-twin cliche of whenever they are onscreen, they are basically just there to say something together (like all twins do all the time).  Since this film focuses more on the big picture of Harry vs. Voldemort, the characters of Draco and Snape are also pretty much absent for most of the film.  I think Snape only has four or five speaking scenes, and you just don't get the vibe of hatred and enmity between Harry and Snape that you get from the novels.  Draco is also limited to very few lines.  His most important scene is probaby my favorite scene from any of the books so far, and that is when Mad-Eye Moody turns him into a ferret, thankfully that scene is in the film in its entirety.  In the book, though, Draco was there during almost every important scene that involved Hogwart's.  He made Harry's life miserable during the tournament, and the film doesn't really give you that impression at all.  The only bad thing that comes from Harry's entrance into the tournament is a fight with Ron, that is drastically cut short also.

So I guess I've only said critical things so far, but I gave it four stars, so I better back myself up.  The visuals in this film are absolutely amazing.  Reading the books, you just can't help but think ""man, I can't wait to see that dragon on the big screen,"" and the dragon scene is amazing, though the filmmakers did take quite a few liberties with it to draw it out a little more and make it a little more ""blockbuster action sequence"" than the book gave us.  Both of the other schools  that compete in the tournament look great.  I thought the filmmakers were spot on with their representation of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang.

Ralph Fiennes finally gets to really appear, and it was amazing.  I don't think that there was a better choice out there for Lord Voldemort.  That's why I was a little disappointed that his speech in the graveyard didn't go as long as it did in the book, but what we do get from him is amazing, and I can't wait for more.  I think if I was 10 years old, and I saw this movie, I would have nightmares for a while.  Voldemort is that creepy.  Everything that I hoped for.

Something also needs to be said for Daniel Radcliffe.  I think he's done a great job, but I also feel a little bad for him.  I feel bad because I think he really is a good actor, but he will always be known as Harry Potter, and it will be really tough to watch him act in another role and be convincing.  But I'm glad that Harry's character is in as good of hands as it is with Radcliffe.

Overall, the film was great.  Yeah, a lot of stuff wasn't included that I would have liked, but overall, the studio is out to make money off of these movies, and it's tough to market a movie that is over 3 hours long.  Although I hope that they go at least 3 hours with Order of the Phoenix.  Harry Potter fans are die hard enough, that we will sit through any length of movie.",1140048000,,4426,4.339416058394161
2505842,3,B000E6EK3S,"I understand they cannot put it all into the movie, that doesn't change the fact that to anyone who read the books it was kind of a let down that so much was left out. Reminds me of Jurassic Park, exciting, great movie but includes maybe half of what went on in the book. And yes these are the same three main characters. Whomever wrote in their review that they are not is not paying very much attention. The actors have not changed, no one complained about that. Overall the movie is pretty good, fast paced and keeps you on your toes. It is my opinion that as of yet Prisoner of Askaban is the best made movie of all of them. I like Goblet of Fire, but, overall I was slightly disapointed when I left the theater.",1140048000,,716,4.195652173913044

If u complain that it wasn't true to the book, apparently you have no idea how long the actual book is, and alot of these reviewers are wrong about the page number of the book. Its not 870, its more like 730. But thats not much a difference anyhow, I just wanted to straighten that out. But back to the review, for the book being so long, Newell directed an extroardinary film. For a 700+ page book, he did awesome.

I am a huge fan of movies 1 2 and 4. If you watched the first two movies, and read the book,itd be like readin the exact movie script. But in movie 3, Cuaron made an awesome movie, but was not true to the book. I loved the movie, but he did not go by the book very well. He put alot of non-important scenes in there, but left out the really important stuff u needed to understand the 4th movie. He did not include the right parts, and the parts he did include were all out of order.

Back to the 4th film, Newell did a perfect job of makin the book to a movie. If your a true diehard fan, u will appreciate this film and enjoy it. The visual effects were out of this world. Very impressive stuff.",1140048000,,1158,4.074561403508772

2505856,5,B000E6EK3S,"I teach reading to kids that start at around 12 and go all the way up to age 18.  Some of these children cannot read at all when I get them.  I use the Harry Potter books to help teach reading because not only are they fun to read, but the instill a passion for lifelong reading.

The fourth film of the Harry Potter series is by far my favorite.  Being that I have read this book around 40 times with my kids, of course I felt dissapointment at ideas and sequences that were left out.  BUT, this director left in the important stuff that you need to be able to jump into movie 5.  I disliked the Prisoner of Azkaban movie because the director left out way too much useful information.  This information was key for the movie audience to understand concepts later.  It almost seemed like the director of POA was not interested in future films, he was only interested in his.

The Triwizard sequences were fantastic and I must admit that I had envisioned a much different senario, but these are now what I see when my students read this to me.  I am excited that this film is coming out on DVD in a couple weeks.

I have to say that Voldemort was wonderful and that sequence is my favorite.  My son, who was 3 when he saw this film at the movies, had his wand out trying to help Harry fight off Voldemort.  It was great and I really feel that many of the negative comments that have been posted on Amazon are unfair.

Along with teacher reading, I am also an author.  I can tell you that trying to adapt a book like this to screen is a nearly an impossible task not only because of the lenght of the book, but the sheer amount of plot twists that need to be shown in order for proper flow into the next film.

So, my only criticism will be to those who having been leaving rude comments.  Make sure you know what your talking about before you leave comments",1139961600,,1856,4.19774011299435
2505857,2,B000E6EK3S,"In this movie the Tri-wizart tournament is going to be held at Hogwarts, but before our heroes can return to school they go to enjoy themselves at the qudditch world cup.  But that fun is interrupted by an attack carried out by the Death Eaters.  And then the dark mark is mysteriously shot into the sky, and everyone is pointing fingers at young Harry Potter.  And if that is not bad enough, someone secretly enters his name into the triwizard tournament (which he is to young to compete in, but is allowed anyways).  Harry must figure out who would do this and survive the tournament at the same time, the odds are against him....

  I came into this movie knowing that a lot would have to be cut out, but I still looked forward to it.  After 2 and a half hours of this movie I came away hugely dissappointed, not only as a Harry Potter fan but also as a movie lover.

  First off this movie is very rushed, scenes are squeezed together and do not flow into each other very well.  I know they had to squeeze a huge book into about 1/5 of the size but this could have been worked out.  It would have basically called for a complete rewrite of the script but it is possible.  I also believe that if 30 minutes were added this movie would be great.  Im sure the argument for not doing this would be that it is to long for young kids and you wouldnt want to lose there attention. Well listen up, Harry Potter fans have grown up, the majority of them are over 16 now.  And the movie is pg-13, so obviously this movie wasn't even aimed at a young audience from a ratings standpoint.  3 hrs is to long you say? if you have already forgotten, a few years back there was a movie called Lotr-Return of the King that went close to a running time of 3 and a half hours, I think they got 11 oscars.  Also Kill Bill was originally one movie but was cut into 2, would have worked out great for Goblet of Fire.

  My 2nd big problem with the movie is that they gave away the villain halfway through.  Ok I have read the book and I knew who it was already, but when I go to these kind of movies I try to clear my mind of what I have read.****Spoiler****(for the 1 person that hasn't read the book or seen the movie) The lip twitch was so unneccessary.  It didn't help the charachters figure out who did it, so why let the audience know halfway through?  They do it 3 times throughout the movie and you have to pick it up when Barty Crouch Jr. is being sentenced.  As soon as I saw Mad Eye do this I was disgusted.**** End Spoiler****.  Rowling never gave it away in the book, so why should they do it in the movie?  Wish I knew because this completely blows my mind.

  The visual effects are very impressive, Harrys fight with a dragon, the huge carriage that the Beauxbatons arrive in is pretty fun to watch.  I also thought the short musical entrance with the introduction of the two schools was very entertaing, and maybe the best scene in the entire movie.  I felt Harrys duel with Lord Voldemort was a little weak and left a lot to be desired, I mean this is the chosen one versus the greatest wizard of all time, not much of a duel in my opinion. The soundtrack was also a little lacking but you cant blame production on that, as John Williams declined this film to work on Memoirs of a Geisha, where he will probaly get his millionth oscar.

  After all is said and done, I do not recommend this movie to anyone, not even to the die hard fans.  I think this movie ruined the earlier succuss that the previous 3 had.  If you must see it go rent it, as this movie is definitely not a keeper.  And by the way I own the first 3 so Im not against the movies, just one that is poorly made.",1139875200,,3676,4.1543909348441925

First off, yes I'm accepting the fact that they arn't giong to show every little detail, thats expected, but the thing that got me was the ones they actually used.  In the book, during the dragon task they never left the area of the egg, in the movie they're flying all over the castle grounds.  In the book, Dobby was the one to get the gilly weed, in the movie it was Neville.  In the book the graveyard duel was great, in the movie they portrayed it as an almost unimportant event.  And I was also very dissapponted with the beginning of the movie, The Cup Finals was a huge event in the book and alot of the major plots started there and I just couldn't beleive that it was barely covered and that they completly left Winky out of the whole movie.  I know shes not a main charecter, but hello...she does play a decent part in the story.  Bottem line, I wasn't pleased at all with this movie for its actual take on the book.

For me, the story just wasn't as tight, the mystery of what was going on felt less alive, and for the first time the special effects seemed more important than the characters.  Even my daughter, who at 10 has read all the books and seen all the films with me, said, ""Dad, that one just wasn't as good.""  It was exactly how I felt, but then, she has always had to explain its intricacies to me, who will probably never read the books.  Moreover, this one is a bit too gory, and so we did not include our youngest, who at 6 would find it a bit disturbing or so we feared.

In spite of that criticism, this film is still above average for a kid movie.  It is visually impressive, you know the characters, and the story line makes a decisive and ominous advance.  So overall, I would recommend this film.  We will definitely get for our collection, though will probably wait until the price goes down a lot more.",1139875200,,1020,4.276041666666667

The first two where ok, but when the film Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban came out in summer 2004 it took the films to a new level and this one does the same thing. Seeing it on the big screen is much better then watching it on a TV no matter how big of a TV you might have, but I can not wait to get this one on 3-7-06! The film is not as good as Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban mostly due to the fact that Alfonso Cuarn made that film so perfectly but Mike Newell did a great job and I still give this film 5 stars!

2505866,5,B000E6EK3S,"In the works of Rowling, a predominant concept is the distinction between figure and ground. She holds that we have to choose between textual presemiotic theory and structuralist deconstruction.  ""Society is intrinsically impossible,"" says Voldemort; however, according to Dumbledore, it is not so much society that is intrinsically impossible, but rather the paradigm, and hence the fatal flaw, of society. But the main theme of the works of Rowling is the futility, and eventually the dialectic, of neotextual class. If conceptual rationalism holds, we have to choose between Muggles and submaterialist discourse.

The subject is interpolated into a conceptual rationalism that includes reality as a reality.  Therefore, several narratives concerning Harry Potter exist. The subject is contextualised into a conceptual rationalism that includes narrativity as a totality.

It could be said that an abundance of sublimations concerning not narrative, but prenarrative may be revealed. If subdialectic rationalism holds, we have to choose between textual feminism and the subsemantic paradigm of discourse.",1139616000,,1106,5.850931677018633
2505867,5,B000E6EK3S,"I loved the movie and all, but my main reason for liking it so much is because I thought they picked a great person to play the part of Fleur Delacour; she's hot!  She plays the part perfectly, and looks better than I imagined her to look in the book.

About the actual movie: it's alright.  Nice special effects and all, but a lot of details were left out that were important to the story.  But hey, that doesn't matter much...Fleur Delacour is pretty, and that's all it takes for you to enjoy the movie, no matter how bad it turns out to be!

Hermione looks awesome in this movie as well; I can't tell you how good Ron and Harry look because I'm a guy.  Read a girl's review to see what she thinks of them.

But...calling all guys: see this movie, Fleur Delacour is extremely beautiful.  That's why I thought the movie was good.  Because without her in the movie, you'd see how much important facts were left out.  Put it this way: if Fleur Delacour had a different actress to be her character, this would get one star from me.

I look forward to the SIXTH movie for the same reason, because Fleur is in that book as well.  It seems these directors have a knack for taking apart Harry's true story, so just enjoy the French actress, because that's pretty much the only way you'll enjoy the movie otherwise.",1139616000,,1308,4.337448559670782

2505870,4,B000E6EK3S,"Harry Potter's newest film is in a nutshell about three big games, one winter ball, and Lord Voldemont. Like the second part of `Lord of the Rings' the fourth entry of Harry Potter series suffers from the typical characteristics of the mid-section of a long tale - too many characters and so few story development - but all in all ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is an entertaining and thrilling film, if the least satisfactory one.

[NO, NOT QUIDDICH] The 157 minute film has got even darker than the previous films. With the deadly Triwizard tournament, in which Harry makes an entry without his knowing as the fourth contestant, director Mike Newell emphases not only the thrills of being a wizard but also its consequences. Probably the fans of the books would not be disappointed with the scenes, and audiences in general would be satisfied with the results even though the CGI is nothing groundbreaking.

A new touch is given in the section where a winter ball is held. The light-hearted tone of the scenes is like that of Hollywood-made comedies featuring fun-loving teenagers (like, as Amazon implies, `Fast Time at Ridgemont High'), but the romantic side of the story is not explored much. Perhaps we are going to see it again in the future Harry Potter films.

[BUT THE REAL WINNER IS...] The actors are all top-notch. You will be amazed to see so many talented actors in UK, but the most stunning is hardly recognizable Ralph Fiennes as Lord Valdemont, who deftly realizes the menace of the ultimate power of darkness without making him a typical villain. His portrait is, like Count Dracula, darkly captivating.

The story is very fast and pretty weak (or I should say repetitious) except the last 20 minutes, and it is getting more and more obvious that for better or worse Daniel Radcliff, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint are all growing very fast. And it is slightly regrettable (even though inevitable) that veterans like Maggie Smith are given less chances to shine among the numerous characters. Still, the film gives plenty of what we want from the series - magic - and is full of thrills and adventures.",1139443200,,2127,4.787465940054496
2505871,4,B000E6EK3S,"Anyone who expects the films to have the same strengths as the books is quite frankly naive. Film and book are two totally different media and both can be appreciated if you just get over the protective snobbery you hold in favour of the one you encountered first.

As far as I'm concerned Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is the best Harry Potter film yet. Forget you ever read the book, and just see it as a film. It works well, apart from the slightly annoying bit at the end where Harry asks Dumbledore why the wands joined and he says ""priori incantatem"" and leaves it at that.

Compared with the other HP films, the acting is better, the humour is funnier, the drama is tenser, the euphoria is happier, the horror is scarier and the emotion is, possibly for the first time, genuinely touching- I nearly cried when Harry brought Cedric out of the maze.

My message is: if you've read the books, please be reasonable. Don't expect each film to be a 10-hour, carefully crafted masterpiece, with every aspect of the novel still intact. It's not going to happen. It's still possible to enjoy the films though- see them as pure entertainment, something to quickly bring to mind the total beauty of the books. Don't be stuck up about it- in doing this it's only you that's missing out- on a film which is genuinely funny, scary and sad and which is perfectly capable of entertaining generations of people- not on the same level that the novels do, but on a different level which is not objectively better or worse- just different.",1139443200,,1532,4.543478260869565

There is no way to give the same attention to detail in a movie as in a 870 page (paperback edition) book. The action was non-stop, and as far as character develpoment, aren't these the same three (Harry Ron Herminone) main characters as in the first three movies?

2505883,2,B000E6EK3S,"This was the most disappointing of the Harry Potter films and has led me to believe that these books cannot be put to film and

do any justice to the film or be a good movie. There is more of the story that has been cut out, the house elves, Hagrid's Giant Confession, than included in the Goblet of Fire and two of the story's leading protagonists are reduced nearly to setpieces. Granted, it is an extremely challenging job to set an 800 page book to film, but if the other films were 2-1/2 hours, how could this film succeed with that time constraint to capture the essence of a book that is twice the others. Some of the characterizations of the new characters were great, like Mad Eye Moony and Rita Skeeter, but Rita Skeeter's character was nearly pointless, since it did not fulfill the storypoint from the book. The maker's even saw fit to add story that was not even in the book, like the Dance Lesson Scene. Why? And they spent gobs of time a the dragon scene which went way beyond the book and wasted precious screen time. They sapped the life out of the maze scene and made it feel like a walk in the park. The editor felt that the elves were no big lost to the picture. I disagree with this because 1) they fill in a lot of questions about who Hermione is and 2) they give us a picture of the wizarding world which is not as nice as we might be led to believe and 3) they fill in the character of Hogwarts which is an essential character to the books and story. This movie is a puzzle with many pieces missing. A major disappointment, if you have any love for the books.",1139356800,,1583,4.224422442244224
2505884,5,B000E6EK3S,"The first two Harry Potter films were good solid films, but with little in the way of creative directing. They were essentially cookie-cutter films, sticking very closely to the books, and that was probably what was necessary to get the series started. With the third film -- Prisoner of Azkaban -- though, things got better. The film kept all that was good in the first films -- good characters, interesting plotlines, etc. -- but was much more creatively directed and much more imaginative (and three-dimensional) visually. Moreover, John Williams produced his best soundtrack in several years to add to the tone of the film.

Goblet of Fire is the second best of the series to date, and is more in line with Prisoner of Azkaban than the earlier films. Again, we get a more complex, multi-layered film than the first two films. There is not only wonder here, but also terror and real sadness. The films, like the books, are growing more mature. This is a fine film and a worthy addition to the series.",1139356800,,1003,4.731428571428571
2505885,4,B000E6EK3S,"Before I start my review, I must disclaim that I am a huge fan of J.K. Rowling's ""Harry Potter"" series. That being said, I am also a big fan of the movies based on the series. There have been many complaints that this movie didn't convey the same texture as the book on which it's based or that too much was left out. These statements, while true at base level, forget that the book in question is 730-some-odd pages long and had the film inlcuded every detail, it would have been one of the longest movies in history. So, if you are a fan of the books and have yet to see this movie, do your best to accept each medium as its own entity, as comparing the two is like comparing apples and oranges.

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I thought that the young actors really stepped up their games in this installment and it was fun to see them dealing with all of their teen angst and such. The special effects are out of this world and, as always, the score is terrific. There are some wonderfully funny moments, as well as some truly heart-wrenching ones near the end of the film.

That said, I do think that this is a weaker film than ""Prisoner of Azkaban"". I think that this weakness lies at the feet of the director, Mike Newell, who seemed intent on making this movie about time spent at a British boarding school. Mr. Newell made the movie with the school being the central element and all of the magic and adventure being secondary, while it's really the other way around. Because the focus was on the social issues at school (a huge amount of time is spent on the ""Yule Ball"" --like a Christmas Prom--and other such issues), a lot of very important details were left out. If you haven't read the book, it's probable that you won't have any idea why anything is happening, as the film jumps all over the place. I have read the book several times and knew what was going on, so it didn't matter much to me. The director and screenwriter opted to leave out a lot of integral details, but kept many either fringe details or included something that was important to the book (like ""Daily Prophet"" gossip reporter Rita Skeeter), but didn't explain or devote enough time to it so as to beg the question, ""What was the point of that??""

Overall, I think that this is an enjoyable movie. If Amazon would allow a review of 3.5 stars, I probably would have ranked it there, rather than give it the four stars that I did. As long as you go into watching the movie with the expectation that it is not the book come to life--just a movie, folks--then you'll enjoy it. If you are the sort who gets bent out of shape when a movie doesn't live up to its parent book, you'll probably be disappointed.",1139356800,,2688,4.350597609561753

2505888,5,B000E6EK3S,This was the best Harry Potter movie that has been released yet.  I found the first movies dissappointing compared to the books.  This movie was true to the book and exciting to watch.  It was great.  The other movies didn't make much sense unless you read the book.  This movie explained everything and gave motive!

2505889,1,B000E6EK3S,"Afte rthe rousing achievement that was PoA this was a HUGE disappointment.  Ok, so the opening was all great & suspenseful,(did anyone but me think of Pyscho when you saw the Riddle house through the window?)  But it just went completely downhill from that point on.  Harry, Ron, & Hermoine go off with everyone to the Quiddich World Cup, & all of a sudden, there back to Hogwarts, before you can even say Quiddich.  Also, before anyone can even sit down to eat the 1st feast at Hogwarts, the other schools are being introduced?  WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!  Rewind, back up a sec.  The projectionist hasn't even had time to sit down yet.  Plus, even though everyone knew who the villain really was, they could,(and should,)have added some mystery to it.  The argument taht Harry set off teh Dark Mark was much too brief, too.  It wen tlike, ""He did it.  Harry-""No I didn.""  Ok, that settles it, mov eon.  Oh, also what was with Barty Crouchs' voice being so high?  Did somebody kick him in the you know where?  But at the end of the movie he sound smore...uh...manly.  Plus, as was said I didn't like Dumbledore.  Ok, so he's suppose to be Harry Potters friend, & perhaps mentor, & he's shoving him against the wall?  I don't think so.  I thought Dumbledore was presented best in PoA, as well as it being the best film.  The tasks weren't nearly as fun & enjoyable.  The best, IMO, was the dragon, even though, as was said, it didn't even look like Harry was scared at all.  Like, it was obviously not even there.  The 2nd Task was way too fast & it was hard to see.  Plus, the Merpeople looked like Medusa.  Ok.  The Yule Ball was ok, right up until they all started dancing to the Wyrd Sisters.  I didn't know Krum headbanged.  Oh, before I move on, when the schools weer introduced, what was with the dancing?  I thought I was watching Rent.  Ok, back to the Yule Ball.  All that was missing in it was a mosh pit.  I was SO waiting for harry to get on stage & jump into the audience.  My dad says they are trying to get a modern feel to the films, but, that was too much.  Also concerning the Yule ball, I di wish they would have talked about the Giantess thing.  Or taht the actress to play Madam Maxine was..uh...not as skeletal.  She looked skinnier than Voldermort & he just got his body back.  The maze was Shining-like, & fairly creepy, although, like was said, quite brief.  Oh, & when Krum is under the spell of the Imperious Curse & his wand is lite he looks RIGHT AT HARRY, but DOESN'T SEE HIM!!!  RIIIGHT!  Finally we get to what everyone was waiting for, Voldermort & the Death Eaters.  But another HUGE joke that was.  I had heard Ralph Fiennes eats up this role with his slimy evilness,, so I was REALLY looking forward to it.  But, those reviewers must have been seeing a different movie.  What I saw almost made me laugh out loud it was so ridiculous.  I think, 1st of all, he needed the red eyes to make him look scary.  The blue just didn't make it, & the nose wasn't enough.  I said it a few times beforee, this scene will make or break the movie.  Although, truth be told, this scene could have been great & everything else would still have been laughable.  The Death Eaters looked like they just came from a Masquerade ball.  The only saving grace of this film was Mad Eye Moody, even though we knew who he was, so there was no suspense.  I have heard people say that he was too harsh & grouchy.  But, hello, in the book, whenever he spoke, Rowling would say, ""he growled.""  So you,(or I did,)assumed he was always...for lack of a better word, moody.  I also read that teachers would never do something like that to students,(think Neville.)  Well, my comment to people who have called Moddy's character a masochist, is, he's suppose to be unorthodox.  Just look at what he did to Draco.  Oh...one fianl note, when th eimposter was revealed,(well, ok, revealed to Harry & the characters, not to the audience,)his face MELTED!  I was reminded of that dream sequence in Poltergeist when the guy rips his face off.  Ok, sure it was scary for kids, but anyone past the age of 15 is gnna find it all silly.  The great thing about the books,(and 1st 3 films,)is, no matter what age, it's not silly.  Ok, maybe the werewolf thing in PoA was silly.  But, that's another review.",1139270400,,4284,4.379617834394905
2505890,3,B000E6EK3S,"I usually don't review HP movies because I'm one of those people who always whines about things that they left out and changed and blah blah blah, no one cares.  But I'm reviewing this one because I think it was the best one so far... yet it still had a ton of wasted potential.

First off, all of the stupid stuff was kept in this movie and all of the important stuff was left out.  Stupid stuff being things like the Yule Ball--in the book it at least had relationship development and the revelation that Hagrid is half giant, but here it was just such a pointless, laughably lame scene.  Important stuff being like the whole thing with racism, Neville's parents, the fact that Harry can fight off the Imperius Curse, the Ministry's not believing Voldemort's come back... and especially the lack of explanation of Priori Incantatem.  I feel sorry for people who haven't read the book, as that must have been extremely confusing.

Another thing is characterization.  People have already pointed out Dumbledore being the opposite of what Dumbledore should be, and I agree. All of the Champions' personalities were either changed (Krum, Cedric) or not there (Fleur.)  The biggest difference, however, is Hermione.  Hermione of the book would NEVER say ""Viktor is more of a... physical being.""  I'm not sure if I should blame the script or Emma Watson's bad acting.. I think I'll go with both.

Allow me to digress on that for a moment... that whole ""RONALD!  YOU RUINED EVERYTHING!"" part where she utterly shrieks was just horrible.  And what was up with her crying during the Unforgivable Curses lesson?  She doesn't know Neville's past.  Daniel Radcliffe also did a poor job acting, but I'm used to that.  I'm hoping he'll be more in his element in five, when Harry is required to be more angsty.  Rupert Grint is the best actor of the bunch, but per usual Ron's shoved aside in favor of Hermione.  We have no explanation for Ron's getting mad at Harry so it feels like it comes completely out of nowhere, and thus, while Grint does a good job, it just comes off as pouty.  I seriously have to wonder if the scriptwriters just don't like him or something

Anyway, what was the worst about this movie, however, was its complete disregard of my intelligence.  The Deatheaters are like the KKK?  REALLY?  Oh my GOD, I never would have figured that out if they hadn't made them wear the KKK-ish costumes!  And what was up with the SMACKING US OVER THE HEAD with the fact that Moody was Crouch, Jr.?  So much for that brilliant plot twist!  They also made Crouch Jr. into, as my friend said, a Scooby Doo villain.  The whole thing about his relationship with his father is gone.  He's just another two-dimensional cackling villain.  I'm also supposed to believe that Sirius would sign his letters as ""Sirius"" even though he's a wanted criminal.  Riiight.

One gigantic plus, however, was Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort.  Oh man, that was the best part.  His eyes literally pierced you!  Amazing.  Also, Katie Leung was a very adorable Cho Chang.  And Bonnie Wright is really becoming a lovely young woman; her scene with Neville was so adorable that for a moment I regretted that JKR said they were only friends.  And kudos to the guy who plays Neville... he was fantastic.  Almost had me crying during the Unforgivable Curses scene.

Overall... it was for me the most entertaining HP movie: I found 1, 2, and 3 positively boring (ironically, 3 is one of my favorite HP books and 4 is my least favorite)  Still, I don't feel that it did a good job of setting things up for movie 5.  The poor scriptwriter of that movie is gonna have a loooot of explaining to do.",1139270400,,3654,4.629283489096573

Mike Newell's style may not be for everyone, but he did an excellent job in continuing and adding to the HP movie series.  Under his direction, there was an addition of grit and fortitude to the landscape and the characters themselves.

2505895,1,B000E6EK3S,"let me start by saying that Goblet of Fire is my favorite of all the books so far and that i was highly upset that WB would alow Newell to distroy such a wonderful story line.  I don't mind that they cut out the whole Dursley stuff but come on they at least could have shown some of the Quiditch World cup, and what they did have seemed so rushed and badly filmed that they might as well have cut that out as well. and once we they get around to the first task they totaly change that as well.  Instead of harry faceing the dragon in the cage like was in the book they have him flying around all of hogwarts like its an ordinary day.  Harry doesnt even look the least bit scared that he is being chased by a dragon.  and when he finally does retreave the egg he lands not even out of breath and barely even scratched up. The secound task didn't fare to much better.  everything underwater was such a blur and the fact that the 2nd task lasted only a short 6 minutes added to my frustration.  When we finally arive to the 3rd and final task I knew without a doubt that they would screw that up as well and sure enough three minutes into the task Harry and Cedric arive at the triwizard cup not even banged up! whatever happened to the chalenges while in the maze?  they face absoultely no dangers. They run straight through to the end.  And finally the big Duel that all the books thus far have led up to, did not live up to nothing.  there was very little suspence, and when we finally get to see what Voldemort looks like, hes a laughing stock. to me he reminds me a alien wannabe.  they didn't even give the guy a nose!!! he looked totaly rediculous.  That being said i think that WB should have released the Goblet of Fire in 2 movies like they were originaly going to do.  There is just too much major information and events that was cut from the book for the movie to make any since at all.  If you ask me this is one movie that should never had been made, and now i am afraid of how they are going to distroy OOTP.

BIG MISTAKE.  The books are ""bloody brilliant"" as Ron would say.  There's absolutely no way any filmmaker could capture the magic of Rowling's work.  To truly enjoy the movies you have to think of them as something completely separate from the books.  If you start comparing the two, you'll only make yourself crazy (as I did after viewing the first 3 movies).  As a movie, I thought GOF was great.  It had action, humor and romance.  And in my humble opinion, I think this is the best movie in the series so far.  My only complaint (and I think someone already mentioned it) is how Dumbledore reacted when Harry's name came out of the Goblet.  Never, in 6 books, has Dumbledore lost his cool like that.  It was quite disconcerting to see him grab Harry and start questioning him the way he did.  That was not how the Dumbledore we all know and love would react.  Other than that, it was a fantastic, fun movie.  Is it as good as the book?  Absolutely not.  None of the movies so far can compare to the books.  So, make life easier for yourself and view the books and movies as separate entities.",1139270400,,1281,4.315126050420168
2505897,5,B000E6EK3S,"I thought this was the best of the 4 films. My only gripe is that they left out the part where Hermione captures Rita Skeeter as a bug after learning she's an animagus. Normally, I don't mind the editing in order to make the movie a reasonable length, but without that ending Skeeter was just an annoyance in the movie. Overall though, it was excellent.

The deluxe 2 disk DVD is also well done. The featurettes have greatly improved over previous editions. The ""Conversations with the Cast"" was interesting and the three stars are well spoken and very funny at times. The piece on the Yule Ball expanded on the actors learning to dance, the set, and the scenes added that weren't in the book. And I, for one, am grateful I didn't have to ""work"" through some game to see the deleted scenes. The extras are worth the additional money versus the single disk edition.",1139184000,,864,4.538461538461538
2505898,3,B000E6EK3S,"Warning: Contains some spoilers

First and foremost, I am a big fan of Harry Potter. However, do to my slight disappointment in the most recent endevors by JK Rowling (mostly The Half Blood Prince), my energy and enthusiam for new novels and movies has become somewhat subdued, and I've tried to look at the Harry Potter films from a average viewers perspective. Harry Potter is very popular and has a huge legion of fans, so, it's right to deduce that, regardless how bad (or good) a Harry Potter film will always at least be good to the fans. Just like die hard Star Wars fans.

So, I'll start simply. This film is not Alfonso Cuarn. That is, the Cinematography is not as impressive, nor does the film flow or feel as dramatic. Newell, the director of Goblet, nailed the romance, as that really is his specialty. Still, Newell doesn't seem to really have his own distinct style as the previous directors, as Columbus and Alfonso Cuarn had. He borrows a great deal from Cuarn and does some brilliant romance and dancing scenes, though the action and fighting scenes are nothing new and follow a very Columbus style in that they are simply way overblown and detract from what the author originally told in the book.

 More money has certainly helped the special effects here, allowing them not just to achieve a greater realism but also to take on more of their own style. The tasks themselves required such a thing, though some fans may be disappointed. The dragon scene is one of those Columbusesque scenes in that it takes an almost completely different direction than Rowling had written. That really isn't a problem, as long as it makes sense with the story. The first task, the one with the dragon, does not. Harry fights in a pit full of sharp rocks, trying to reach the dragon's egg. In the book, it was a big cage. This is really not a problem either, as big rocks with pointy edges gives more of a sense of a dragon's lair. What is worse is what comes afterward. Harry quickly grabs his broom and makes for the sky. The dragon breaks from its chain leash. What follows is a typical Columbus. Harry dangles from a ledge hundreds of feet above the ground, almost is killed, eaten, devoured by the dragon, and he lands on the ground, perfectly composed. Come on, even Harry is not invincible. Any real person would be either freaking out after something as traumatic as that, but Harry Potter simply walks away, doesn't barf or show any sign of emotion indicating that he should really be scared out of his wits. People get in car accidents all the time and commonly are shaking or cry after such a traumatic event. Secondly, Dumbledore would never willingly and consciously put Harry in a situation where he knew he could die. This idea that Dumbledore would allow a faulty leash on a dragon is just stupid and allows the special effects guys some time to shine on the big screen.

 The one task that really works in this film is the Lake. Goblet being my favorite book, this is one of my two favorite scenes. Newell did perfectly, even if it didn't fit my imagination exactly. It was given the time it needed and wasn't rushed.

 Which brings us to the bad beginning, by far the weakest in all of the Potter films. Quite simply, it's terrible. I have no problem with the Dursleys being gone, but, to really understand how bad the beginning really is, you must see it. Next to no character development, no quidditch after a huge and climatic build up. The film really starts getting going a fourth of the way in.

 The beginning also starts us down a road to the book's mysterious plot, by far the best in the entire series of books, with the most sub plots and twists. It was good to see the House Elf subplot removed, as I never noticed it and it really would have detracted from the movies breakneck pace.

 Going in I knew the entire plot, every twist. Still, even as a Potter fan, there was simply way to many visual cues used in this film. Way to many that, by simple deduction, reveals the plot before it even comes to a conclusion. What is Newell expecting for an audience? Stupid kids? Everyone should know by this time Harry is making a transformation into an adult and no longer is a twelve year old, and the book likewise is graphic and violent and not made to read it at that age (though they're welcome to). The cues themselves are cheesy and had me almost laughing.

 Another some will miss (although probably not notice the first time round) is the missing John Williams. The score in this film plays it safe and follows John William's familiar themes; so don't expect anything staggering or brilliant. Hedwig's theme is heard but not overpowering, something I will miss. The only hope we have is a composer as talented as Williams taking the helm in the next movie or John returning. I'm not very optimistic on that point.

 Overall, Goblet of Fire is a very good movie and better than Columbus's' attempts, though still is a step in the wrong direction, as it takes a little too much from Christopher and doesn't have any unique style to identify itself with, like Cuarn. Should be a delight for most Potter fans and a good movie for others.",1139184000,,5167,4.539784946236559
2505909,5,B000E6EK3S,"Although much has been said about the fourth Potter film as to it's hype and big budget, I believe it lived up to it's expectations.  It was drastically undermarketed, unlike the mediocre Prizoner of Azkaban, whose quick cuts and book-straying script left me with a bad taste in my mouth.  I believe more could have been done to promote the release of Goblet of Fire.  The only thing I would have wanted to add to the movie is a better development of Harry and Cho's relationship.  Regardless, I think Goblet of Fire was the best movie of 2005.",1139184000,,544,4.520408163265306
2505910,1,B000E6EK3S,"I really liked the first three, but I really hated this movie. It's a two hour long movie about the Potter kids going through puberty. Yes, I know they are now 14, puberty age, but they didn't have to make the ENTIRE movie about it. The plot was very weak because so much of the film focused on the puberty aspect of it. The kids begin to notice the opposite sex, fight for no reason, girls are emotionally irrational, they need to find dates, Harry even ends up naked in a bath tub with the ghost girl. What disturbs me about the movie is that Hermione starts dating this bulgarian guy who's at least 17 years old if not older. Why would a 17 year old want to date a 14 year old? When you're in high school and going through puberty, even 1 year is a world of difference. Then it was hinted at that their relationship was ""physical"" which made me so thankful that I didn't have kids because 14 is disgustingly young to be having sex. Then there was some forshadowing that Hermione and Ron would end up together. It's like, Johnny Quest. Everyone wants Johnny to go out with Jessie, but she goes out with Haji intsead. Harry's love interest makes her appearance. Some Asian girl with a bad Irish accent. I can't get over the ball scene where all the girls are crying for no reason. Seriously, if I wanted to watch a movie about a bunch of kids going through puberty, I would have seen 10 Things I Hate About You or The Breakfast Club. By the way, NOTHING is resolved at the end of this film. It lacked action to the point where I left the theater with a strong urge to watch Kill Bill vol. 1. I know, I didn't read the book, but this a MOVIE, not a book. Actually, I'm thinking of reading the book because it HAS to be better than this movie.",1139184000,,1742,4.218562874251497

I walked away from this feeling like it was a HUGE contender for best picture of the year at the oscars, but of course, it will be overlooked by that sausagefest brokeback. The scene where Valdemort and harry are locked with the two beams from thier wands, and all those spirits come out, and harrys parents appear and take his side was just breath taking. I was holding back tears. The acting was fantastic, the effects, the story (I never read the book so im unbiased). Wonderful. Just like movies like the Shawshank redemption and the sixth sense, this will be looked over for the masterpiece it is at the oscars.",1139184000,,738,4.474074074074074
2505912,5,B000E6EK3S,This movie is by far the most amazing in the series and they will all keep getting better.

2505913,1,B000E6EK3S,"It is expected that movies and books are going to be different. Many books are too long to fit into a nice little movie package but this movie should have been stated that it was LOOSELY based on the Harry Potter books. Many things that were necessary to move the story line along in the upcoming movies were cut out completely and the director added crap that had nothing to do with the book.

Harry Potter movies past have disappointed me but this was the first one that I actually wanted to walk out on. It's a great movie if you don't read the books. If you read the books and know how far off this director went then it's likely you will only buy this movie because it's Harry Potter.

 No Percy, no Ludo Bagman, no Veelas, we do have one insane and near violent Dumbledore, no Rita Skeeter being an animangus, no Dobby, no Winky,no S.P.E.W., no gobblins, no betting, no Dursleys, no Platform 9 3/4, no demetors, no Barty Jr. receiving the kiss from a dementor or his death in any fashion, no giant/giantess reveal. There was, how ever, enough room to add crap that had nothing to do with the story, like Barty Jr. being in places he never was, Dumbledore practically attacking Harry, Fred and George fighting instead of laughing when they grow beards after crossing the age line and a flying dragon scene that doesn't add to or move the plot along in any way.

2505916,5,B000E6EK3S,This movie is the best one so far in this series. The story was very good. This is absolutely the darkest part in the series.,1139097600,,125,4.04
2505917,1,B000E6EK3S,"the first thing i have to say is: what was the deal with all that sexual innuedo between the ghost girl in the bathroom, Wailing Wendy or Weeping Wendy, whatever her name is, and an *UNDERAGE* boy?! where she's trying to get a look at Harry's junk and rubbing up on him for like 20 minutes. i found that to be quite disturbing. am i the only one who thinks so? now for the movie overall. i haven't read this book (i've only read the first; started the second but got bored within the first couple chapters) and i had no idea what was going on through 90% of the movie. things just seemed to happen out of nowhere, with no warning and for no apparent reason. and then they were just left unresolved. and the things i'm talking about aren't the kind of things that might be cliffhangers for the next movie. these are things that are critical to this movie and this movie alone. for me it left *everything* to be desired. i was completely unsatisfied when i left the theater. and, yes, quite confused as well. and that scene at the end when Cedric's dad finds out that his son is really dead. and he just screams and moans in extreme pain and sorrow for the loss of his child. what kind of an utterly depressing ending is that for a movie based on a children's book!?! and the ending! wow! that came out of nowhere. first the movie drags on jumping from place to place then all the sudden without warning and with no explanation for any events in the movie it's over and even though a kid is dead and evil incarnate has risen to power again no one is upset or afraid *at all* and they're all just happy to go home for the summer. and apparently after years of confinement in a weakened state Voldemort also needs a summer vacation before he starts causing havoc because after his little showdown with Harry he just disappears and isn't mentioned again. oh, yeah, and some freind that little bastard Ron is. Harry's supposed to be this really honest, genuine kid and a great friend but in spite of that and Harry's sincerest professions that he didn't put his name in the Goblet of Fire Ron refuses to believe him and acts like a total ass towards Harry for the remainder of the movie.

laslty, can anyone who's read the book explain to me why Barti Crouch died? because all i know is Harry, Ron, Hermione, and Hagrid were (apparently) going on a ""random dead body check""  around the Hogwarts grounds. they're walking around the woods in the fog in the late evening - what else would they be doing? no one ever says. what am i supposed to think when they happen upon this dead body? (once again) for no apparent reason or motive for his death. *AND* it doesn't move the plot along in any way, shape, or form. after you see his dead body the fact that he's dead or ever existed is never mentioned again.

the only redeeming factors were, obviously, the excellent special effects. but as everyone knows special effects alone can't carry a movie. oh, and how come we only get to see Harry fight his dragon and we only see what Harry's and i think Cedric's dragons look like? i wanted to see the Red Chinese dragon or whatever it was.

the only other slightly redeeming factor was that cute Asian girl made cuter by the fact that she had an Irish accent.

don't get me wrong these two things didn't really redeem the movie at all, they're just two things that i found enjoyable off-topic from the movie. i didn't really enjoy the movie itself at all.

overall this movie was a truely convoluted and depressing disappointment for Harry Potter AND all movie cinema.",1139097600,,3555,4.411585365853658
2505918,4,B000E6EK3S,"""Goblet of Fire"" is a roller coaster ride of action and suspense, as well as a film with deep, emotional, inner-meanings and morals to real life as well. Those of us who have read the books will have to realize that the films cannot keep in everything from the books. ""Book purists"" are just going to have to come to peace with this fact. Books and movies are completely different genres of entertainment. You have to remember they're trying to cram some 400-something-page book into 3 hours. The Dursleys are cut, as well as Hermione's rants about house elves and some things are tweaked to fit in just nicely. I would not recommend any young children to watch it, as it is PG-13 and there are a lot of disturbing and scary themes that run through it. Harry Potter is no longer a kiddies movie, and won't get any lighter from this point on. The beginning is a little choppy, but they had to skim through the unimportant stuff quickly.

After having a disturbing dream about Voldemort's new plan, and attending the Quidditch World Cup with Hermione, Ron, and Ron's family, Harry enters Hogwarts to find that the Triwizard Tournament, a selection of magical contests where one witch or wizard from the three most powerful wizarding schools--Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang-- are chosen to compete, is taking place at Hogwarts. After the three champions are supposedly already chosen, Harry's name is mysteriously pulled out of the Goblet of Fire (even when he didn't enter!), an impartial judge that had an age line around it to make sure no one under seventeen would get in. The Goblet has a binding magical contract on it that forces Harry to compete. A very paranoid and slightly creepy new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Professor Alastor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody, an ex-Auror (dark wizard-catcher), enters the school and gives Harry a seemingly helpful nudge along the way and Harry grows to like him somewhat--although pay close attention to his drinking habits (What is it that he's drinking?). While being only 14, our poor Harry is forced into a fretful situation- full of his best friend Ron's jealousy and anger at Harry ""not telling him"" he was going to put his name in the Goblet, an awkward crush on the lovely Cho Chang of Ravenclaw, and the Tournament's three tasks leaving an ominous and unnerving road ahead of him.

The thing I liked about Goblet of Fire is that it brought out the characters that really never should have been in the background in the first place- like Ginny, who becomes more important later on, and Neville, who is really just a sweet character that also has a big importance in the next installment. Fred and George are no longer just a walking-away kind of joke, but have actually many hilarious moments in the film.

Emma Watson acts well, but seems on the verge of tears a lot, which is not really like her character. Hermione is like Harry's mother in this book, especially when Harry and Ron are fighting. The Yule Ball is a turning point for Hermione, where she is so pretty that she becomes unrecognizable to many unless they take a good look at her. I think the only problem is that Emma is such a gorgeous girl, that for those of us who've seen her premiere photos are not surprised at all by Hermione's so-called ""transformation"". The Yule Ball is definitely the most colorful scene, and you sense that Ron denies Hermione even being there because he is too jealous of Krum, and when Hermione cries in the end it ties off the scene very well because she's so confused- there's always someone left crying at a high school dance and that's the oddly pleasant reality of it. Harry longingly watches the handsome and talented Cedric Diggory (the other Hogwarts champion) dance with his girlfriend, whom Harry finds out is Cho Chang, the girl Harry's crushing on.

Harry faces a dragon, a murky lake full of scary mermaids and grindylows (vicious underwater demons) and an extremely large maze that gives you goosebumps. Harry helps Cedric throughout the three tasks and they have a kind of tennis match of little helps and hints that leads to them having a respectful friendship in a way. But, the maze ends with Harry and Cedric having found the Triwizard Cup in the center, and deciding to take it together. This decision leads Harry right into the hands of the evil Lord Voldemort, and changes his life forever. He finds that ""Mad-Eye Moody"" was an imposter using Polyjuice Potion after kidnapping the real Mad-Eye and using his hair for the potion, and was the one luring Harry to Voldemort from the beginning. Harry experiences death for the first real time, and the look in his face at the funeral in the end signifies it all. Daniel really worked hard this time to get everything right, and you feel like you should just give Harry a tight hug and never let him go in the end.

Many say the film is very choppy, but I don't think I've ever been more satisfied with a film's length in a while. The first twenty minutes are indeed very quick, but they had to be to fit in important things.

The final ending is very satisfying and you really see the strong bond of friendship between Harry, Ron and Hermione and how something like that can never part. And although you know that there'll ""never be a dull year at Hogwarts"", you cannot help but see the hope that the ending leaves us on that maybe one day, wars and evil may come to an end. Although, in the Potter world, this is only just ""The Beginning"" (the title of the last chapter of Goblet of Fire). Have some tissues on hand if you're prone to crying on those kinds of endings.

All in all, a great film, but if you haven't read the books, you'll need to be filled in on a few things because you may get confused. The music is great and fitting, the acting is superb, and the morals stand strong and shows the true essence of the books.",1139011200,,5848,4.611911623439001
2505919,1,B000E6EK3S,"Uuughh. Like all the Harry Potter movies, this movie was absolutely RUBBISH. It was a complete joke. And the acting, oh come on. Do you people have eyes?????????????? Both Daniel Radcliffe and Emma watson are HORRIBLE. Rupert has the best potential of the three, even though that's not much. The one actor in this movie I found was actually okay was Rob Pattinson or something, a shame his character died.

I read the books, I'm fan Numbahr Uno when it comes to the books. I've read them about a thousand times. I've even seen the movies a thousand times, though they are certainly not the best movies in the world.

But this, this was the absolute worst. What the hell was with the dragon chase scene??? It was all about showing off the special effects and that it what bothers me. Lord of the Rings for example was made to tell a story. Harry Potter movies are made to earn money.

And luckily the next movie has a different screen writer, it still give me some small amount of hope, maybe Movie 5 will sweep me of my feet. But that's probably not going to happen.",1139011200,,1066,4.428571428571429
2505920,1,B000E6EK3S,"OK, please don't kill me for giving it one star!  Don't get me wrong, I LOVE the books.  They are awesome.  So here is my question:  Why would you completely change the characters in Harry Potter for the movie?  I mean, there is a REASON that J.K. Rowling is earning piles of money for her books!  The characters are all wrong (in the movie).  Dumbledore throws Harry aganst the wall and yells at him...Voldemort says that he will reward Pettigrew because he is a ""kind"" lord.  Uh, what?  Since when does Voldemort prize the quality of kindness?  Even Cedric is wrong!  He doesn't come across as being the kind and noble character that he is supposed to be.  So many of the actors/actresses have been badly miscast or have such stupid lines, that even the high quality CGI can't save this movie.  The directing was very poor.  If I hadn't read the books, I would have been completely lost.  One of the things that I love about the books is the humor.  In the  HP4 movie they added long random scenes that were not in the book to make it funny, and it just doesn't work.  About 7 minutes of film time are wasted with Ron explaining to Harry that he had been trying to warn Harry about the dragon, but in an unobvious fashion.  (I heard from a friend of a friend that a friend of a friend heard that Hagrid wants to meet you later on in the woods...)  This movie was a big disappointment.",1139011200,,1386,4.319066147859922
2505921,5,B000E6EK3S,"Ok, first of all, the movie is done as well as it could have been. It does leaves out some facts that the book felt was  important to include. But miniscule things must be omitted. They did the best job possible that they could have done to eliminate less important plot lines. The opening scenes could have been  allowed more time, and made it feel less rushed, but it worked out well. The acting in this movie is a definite improvement over those last 3 movies. You will applaud Daniel Radcliffe's performance. Emma Watson is as much of an amazing actress as she has always been, and I still think that she is underused. Her scenes at the Yule Ball were awe-inspiring. The effects, visual and CG, are amazing. You can feel as if you are there right now. Ralph Fiennes plays Voldemort beautifully and sends chills down your spine and makes you loath him from his first second on screen. Miranda Richardson really hit the nail on the head with Rita Skeeter. Her scenes are some of the funniest of the entire movie. The Director of this installment of the highly successful Harry Potter series was Mike Newell. He does an outstanding job. There are some scenes that are so cinematically amazing. The overall feel of the film is without a fast-paced action thriller. You fear for Harry's life every second of the film. I was thoroughly impressed with this film, and with the fifth book being my favorite, I am praying that the film works wonders.

2505935,5,B000E6EK3S,"Hello everyone.  First off I would like to say ""THANKGOODNESS"" that soon this DVD will be added to my extensive collection.  As well as most of you here I am a major HP fan(I have to thanks the kids I take care of for that. They were all reading the books and they're like you have to read them.  What else could I do I cracked under the pressure, broke down and read HP and the Philosophers stone.)  I was hooked I loved it and when the movie came out I went with the kids I work with on a March break field trip to see the movie.  From there I continued to read, HP and the Chamber of Secrets.  Then HP and the Prisnor of Azkaban. Then HP and the Goblet of fire.  By the time the second movie came out I had read them all again twice.  At this point I bacame a little ( very little) dissapointed with the second movie.  The movie was just very different than the book.  When the fifth book came out I waited in line for 7 hours to be the third person in my local area to buy the book.  I began at the begining again and read all the books right through to Order of the Pheonix.  When the third movie came out I was there the day it was released.  It was very different from the first 2 movies, but there was just something about it that made it wonderful (Hermoine punches Malfoy, great stuff).  I loved it.  The sixth book came out and it was back to the begining again.  The Half Blood prince was great, and I can't wait to line up for the seventh book already.  The came the fourth Movie and the Reason why I write this.  Harry Potter And the Goblet of Fire.

Yes of course yet another line to stand in for hours but it was well worth the wait.  Sure I am one of those crazy fans who probably could have sat and watched for ten hours if thats how long it had been made, but alas it was just over three and yes alot was cut out in the process of shrinking this down. But the final product in my eyes has been that this newest installment of Harry Potter has been the best one to date.  There has been so much growth in not only the characters but the entire movie.  From yes the obvious chracter growth all the way to the change in costumes in the details of all the little aspects of the movie and to the big action scenes with all the new special effects.  This movie ( if you couldn't tell by now) was by far my favorite.  I would give it 100 stars if that was option.  Anyonewho was a little let down after the second one or the third one needs to hang in there for this fourth installment. Its Just Great.",1138752000,,2514,4.0
2505936,4,B000E6EK3S,"I thought this movie could've been better.  I love the Harry Potter movies and it is not easy for me to say that this one could be better.  I thought a lot of important stuff was left out, but there are three movies left so we will see how the others go.  I gladly give this movie a four star rating.",1138752000,,300,3.8852459016393444
2505937,5,B000E6EK3S,"This marvelous interpretation of the fourth of the Harry Potter books focuses almost entirely on action, and does so masterfully. The movie focuses to a great degree on the Tri-wizard Tournament, especially Harry's part in it. His fight with a dragon is frighteningly realistic, up through the crash and cracking of tiles as the dragon pursues Harry across rooftops. The underwater scenes (watch for excellently-rendered bubblehead charms!) are terrific and frightening.

This is the book in which the young French ladies of the BeauxBatons school and the strapping Slavic young men of Durmstrong school travel by magical coaches and ships to Hogwarts to make friends and engage in friendly competition. It's also the book in which our young heroes - Harry, Ron and Hermione-begin dealing with their romantic impulses. The Yule Ball is beautifully rendered, as is the palpable discomfort of the young people at the thought of boys and girls having to dance...with each other. Ick.

The final battle, with Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort is eye-popping, exciting and quite moving. This is the first film in which Voldemort gains a body, and Fiennes (with ample help from the makeup crew and presumably lots of CGI work) gives that body an evil intelligence to match.

An incredibly film, visually engaging, with few flaws and unbelievable images that will stay with you for a long time.",1138665600,,1385,5.119469026548672
2505938,4,B000E6EK3S,"Those who have said HP4 will be coming out in March or April and the Warner Bros has it for pre-order.  Are you ABSOLUTELY positive?  I've been on Warner Bros official site and it says that the DVD does not yet have a release date.  Looking back on all of the other films, they were released 6 months after the film was released in theaters, which pushes the release date out until May.  I really hope I'm wrong on this and you people are right.  I'm looking forward to getting my hands on the DVD!",1138665600,,498,4.2
2505939,5,B000E6EK3S,"I read the first 'Potter' book just days before the first film was released on video, and I have to say I was shocked! The film was SO accurate, it blew me away! Even the characters looked almost exactly as I had pictured them when reading the book. Since then I've read the entire 'Potter' series three times, and I watch the first three films a few times a week. Most recently, the fourth film 'Goblet of Fire' was released to theatres, and so far I've seen it five times. I will say that I was disappointed in the fact that most of the sub-plots were left out, and a few things were changed around a bit, but overall the movie was amazing. I fully understand that time-restraints couldn't allow the filmmakers to recreate the entire book. However, I don't think the film was as accurate as it could have been. For instance, the third task was kind of sad to watch. It was VERY eventful in the book, but the film really did it no justice. Voldemort's return, however, was sheer perfection. Overall, I'm a 'Potter' fan to the core, and I think that so far, the filmmakers have done an amazing job. Those people who complain about the films don't seem to realize that the filmmaker's work closely with J.K. Rowling herself during the production, and she's ALWAYS been happy with the finished product. That's good enough for me.",1138665600,,1327,4.5103734439834025
2505940,4,B000E6EK3S,"I believe that this movie was great considering the time limit they had to work with.  The actors were great and did a good job on the film.  Too many people complaining the movie didn't live up to the book, lots of things were cut off yada yada yada but when have u read a book and seen the movie where the movie contained everything the book does.  There is always going to be more details in a book than the movie and if u hate the movie and are disappointed so much with it then why bother seeing it to then complain about it later.  Also people complain the movie wasn't funny and lack love blah blah blah i guess if u had read the book, its about voldemort's return, cedric dies, harry fights voldemort, ummm  i don't really see the humor in all that.  The book itself was pretty dark and not as soft as the first 3.  Remember Harry is getting older, hence his life is getting more dangerous, hence voldemort is finding ways of trying to get to him.  The movie was great and I believe showed the most important parts of the book.  I would have included the house elves and shown the whole aspect of Rita Skeeter and how she is an animagus and was captured by Hermione but again, the movie can only do so much because of the time limit.

Yes they had to leave some out but it flowed amazing well and they left nothing crutial out.  For those of you who don't read the books you will just LOVE this movie for those who read the book you will also love it but just know that some of the great comic relief things are cut as well as the Rita story line is VERY much shortened she's not even an animagus so that is a bit of a let down but you'll REGRET not seeing it on the big screen  it's worth every bit of the 7.50 to see.  Prepare to jump out of your skin at the tournament sceens.  SOOOO much fun oh and the Quitich world cup is just as i pictured it in my head!  Only other thing left out you might feel sad about is no house elves in this one and therefor no SPEW lol.

When you see the harry potter movies first you learn to respect the movies first, then the books. This movie although it was very entertaining, it was very different from the book. First of all, they never add in anything about veelas, S.P.E.W., dobby, winky, and ludo bagman. The appearences of the other students in the Tri-wizard tournament is shortened. Although, I am an obsessive harry potter/daniel radcliffe/and emma watson fan, this movie could have been better. They could have put way more from the book into this movie. Yet it wasn't a total dissapointment. I just wished that they had followed to book a little bit more.

2505948,2,B000E6EK3S,"Harry Potter annd the Goblet of Fire finally made it to my small-town movie theatre, so I went to see it.  And I'm glad I did go to see it instead of waiting for the DVD, because if I had bought a DVD of this travesty without any idea of what I could expect, I would have been frothing at the mouth within minutes.

As others have mentioned, the plot was much abridged.  I can understand the need for extreme tactics when condensing a 700+ page book into a 2 1/2 hour film, but the richness of the story definitely suffered and the plot lost its context, reducing it to a series of action sequences that quickly became tiresome viewing without the setting of a wider plot.  Most of these sequences were either so overblown, as in the dragon challenge, that they actually detracted from the story, or so condensed, as in the Quidditch World Cup sequence, that I really wondered why they'd been left in at all.  I can't imagine how anyone who hasn't read the books would follow the story that was left.  Even with the cuts, most of the characters were abysmally underused. The other champions had so little to do that their presence seemed  almost superfluous.  And I wonder how they're going to handle the movie treatment of later books, since characters and subplots that become relevant later on were totally missing.

But the worst thing was the quality of the directing.  It was terrible.  The characterizations were completely off in several places.  Dumbledore was not the serene, strong and compassionate  figure he is meant to be;  rather he was portrayed as shaken and lacking in control and confidence.  As I quite enjoyed Michael Gambon in Prisoner of Azkaban (my favourite of ths films), I can only attribute this change to poor direction.  Likewise, Moody was a petulant buffoon rather than the eccentric old warrior of the book. And Cedric, who was supposed to be kind, loyal, hardworking, and above all, as a Hufflepuff, HUMBLE, was portrayed through most of the movie as an arrogant jock.

 Some people have spoken of the darkness of this film.  I can't understand what they mean, as I didn't consider the film remarkably dark, despite the presence of Lord Voldemort and several scenes set in a graveyard.  There was no dramatic tension and no really sinister tone set.  Many places that should have been emphasized--the resurrection spell, for example--were treated in so offhand a way that it was as if they actors were performing with their backs to the camera.  And every moment that called for some kind of emotional impact was reduced to a melodramatic shouting display, with subtlety of delivery and emotional variety totally absent.  I was shocked that the actors involved accepted such direction and astounded that the director of Four Weddings and a Funeral could have given it.

There were some nice moments.  I enjoyed the lead up to the Yule ball and the underwater task quite a lot--and both of these followed the book better than any other part of the movie.  Fred and George Weasley simply get better and better;  they steal every scene they're in and I can't wait for their big moment in movie five.  And I quite liked the use that was made of Neville.  But all in all the film adaptation of GoF made a poor showing.  This is my least favourite of the films so far.",1137974400,,3297,4.663778162911612
2505949,5,B000E6EK3S,"In this forth instalment in the ever popular Harry Potter series based on the novel by JK Rolwling we see Harry mature in many ways, he must over come three deadly tasks, face a fully formed Lord Voldermort and possibly the most horrifying task of all for the 14 year old Harry, he must get himself a date for the Yule Ball!

The performance of the trio in the Goblet of Fire is amazing, every scene seemed to be executed perfectly and the on screen chemistry between the young stars is evident. Daniel Radcliffe (Harry Potter) reaches new heights in this movie perfectly portraying the uncomfortable adolescent Harry has become; he faces the new emotional roles in the movie with confidence and enthusiasm, like wise for Radcliffe's young co-stars Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) Once again we see terrific performances from the likes of Dame Maggie Smith (Professor McGonagall), Alan Rickman (Professor Snape) and Robbie Coltraine (Hagrid) as well as meeting some new faces amongst the students, including students from two other magical academies who join the students at Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry to participate in the Tri-Wizard Tournament! Another highlight of this marvellous movie is Ralph Fiennes' portrayal of Lord Voldermort which can be rather alarming even to an adult!

I believe this movie to be of an excellent standard not only due to the charismatic trio, but also thanks to the special effects of this movie. We see many fascinating creatures including a ferocious fire breathing dragon (which Harry must fight armed with nothing but his wand!) and while watching you can truly forget that these creatures were created using blue screen and you can honestly believe that you are in this world, that it truly exists just behind closed doors. This is very true to the novels making this a movie every Potter fan can enjoy and indeed fans of spectacular plots and mind-blowing special effects alike can appreciate this, making the Goblet of Fire a movie for all the family! Overall I would call this movie riveting and n absolute gem of the movie world. You do not want to miss this brilliant piece of film history, no DVD collection would be complete with out it!

2505950,5,B000E6EK3S,"Like almost everyone else on the planet, I'm a huge Harry Potter fan. I've loved the books since 1999 and the films since the first movie premiered in 2001. Each book and movie continued to meet my expectations and beyond. Like every true crazed Harry Potter fan, I've seen all four movies the day of release and each time I struggle to sit still in anticipation. This time was no different. I was especially excited because the movie had gotten the best reviews of the series and it was my favorite book out of all 6. I was also hoping it would be better than the last one, because with each film, though still amazed by each, I was slightly less impressed. The first was truly amazing, as was the second. The third was much different, but after adjusting to the new feel, I loved it ALMOST as much as the others. Therefore, this time I was hoping for it not to be an 'almost'. While actually watching the 4th film, I was slightly confused. It was a little fast and hectic. However, having read the book 3 times, I could fill in the blanks. At the end, my friend with me said, ""Oh come on! That had to have been your favorite!"" At first, I wasn't sure and disagreed with him. I said I needed to think for a minute. And after that minute, I put all the pieces together. He was 100% correct. The movie, although still different than the feel of 1 and 2, was amazing. It had wonderful special effects, and the story line was perfection, despite a few details left out from the book. But, I promise you, that this it's IMPOSSIBLE to not like this movie.

To sum it all up: The movie was rushed, but you can't expect it to be 10 hours long. So, it was well done in the time they had.

It had maturity. This series has finally become a man.

I definitely recommend going to see it in theaters if it is still playing in your town.. and I'm definitely gonna buy it when it comes out on DVD. It was way better than the previous three.,1137888000,,319,4.161290322580645
2505952,5,B000E6EK3S,"this movie was great. the book is even better because it has even more things for you to enjoy. im looking forward to get this 2 disc set and the bonus features on disc 2 seem like they can be more fun then the previous 3. why they would waste money on single disc sets with no bonus features seems kind of stupid so if you are a huge harry potter fan then the 2 disc is the way to go. i have seen a trailer for these bonus features and the interviews seem pretty cool cause you get to go behuind the scenes of the special effects and the games seem to be more fun then the previous answer questions and choose left or right type things. also they keep saying the release date is march 7 yet there have been no pre orders on any site except for the 8 disc sets and it comes out in less then 2 months. it just seems that either pre orders or taking a long time to set up or this disc may get delayed to april or something but i really hope it doesnt.

i must comment on these religuos people post there reviews for not only the harry potter movies but other films as well. all these people do is seem to look at movies for the religous aspect of them when most movies don't have anything to do with religion. Harry Potter never even comments on religion. i never hear anyone in the books or movies say anything about GOD or JESUS. Movies and Books are for entertianment. Unless its a documentry don't take things so seriously. The harry potter books don't go around telling kids to put curses on people and fly around on brooms. its just about a boy who has magic powers and some bad guy is after him. he is just a kid going to school having friends having problems with teachers and bullys. this stuff gives kids imaganations and gives them something to take there minds off of the things around them. If its a bad movie fine say its a bad movie and what parts of it are bad like the acting or the scenes or the set designs but don't judge a movie just cause it goes agianst your beliefs. if it does don't watch it and watch something that is more on your level.",1137888000,,2062,4.103960396039604

2505955,5,B000E6EK3S,"First and foremost to those of you who are strong ""hard-core"" Christians, let me say this. As the son of a librarian I know how hard authors work to write stories kids will read, so when a story comes along that is met by the children - adult audience with absolute enjoyment all around, there is no reason for it to be shoved aside without first being read/viewed by the parent. Fine this story brings up what one could call witchcraft. However, besides teaching morals that every kid should learn, morals such as loyalty, honest, justice, standing up for ones beliefs, it also has some what of a Christian backdrop with Christmas and Easter having some prominence in most of the books. If you think these books/films should be banned then I hope you are willing to also add the bible to the list for its, shall we say, adult scenes. I see no difference as to why Narnia and Lord of the Rings are no better or worse from this standpoint.

Anyway, this movie is by far the best of the three, as it is also the darkest thus far. The music is great, I did not even realize it was not John Williams until someone told me. The story for the most part stays true, and key characters have made a huge amount of progress in their skills as actors since the first film.

In fact, I see this element of witchcraft more as a mix of Greek/Roman mythology and Arthurian Legend.",1137888000,,1365,4.3700787401574805
2505956,4,B000E6EK3S,"This is the first review I've bothered to write; unfortunately it has nothing to do with the movie itself.  It's amazing to see that any religious group would have a problem with a bit of fiction that teaches children (in an entertaining way) good morals any parent would be glad to see their children acquire.  These stories are about doing the right thing in the face of adversity.  The stories teach that there is nothing greater than love.  Why would any religion that teaches to love your neighbor have a problem with that?

My guess is these people haven't even read or seen the films.  I would even guess that they would have a problem with The Lion, The Witch and the Wardrobe is someone didn't explain it was about the resurrection of Jesus.

The film was pretty acurate except Neville Long Bottom gives Harry the gilly weed not Doby and the maze had the obsticles cut out due to not enough time since the book is over 800 pages.  The most important parts were really focused on and done well and the fun things that were added like with the exceeding chase from the dragon spiced the film up and made it exciting.

2505973,5,B000E6EK3S,"Okay, I know a lot of people were generally pleased with the movie but somewhat disappointed that things were cut or changed.

Here's what I do when going into one of these films -- I ACCEPT THE FACT THAT THE MOVIES AND THE BOOKS ARE TWO SEPARATE THINGS!!!

No movie has ever really captured EVERY SINGLE THING if it is adapted from a written work.  There are things in books that simply can't be brought to life via film, and vice versa.  That's why if such a situation arises where a book or story is made into a film, the credits read -- BASED UPON THE NOVEL BY J K ROWLING.  Notice how it didn't say -- THIS MOVIE CONTAINS EVERY SINGLE THING CONTAINED IN A 700+ PAGE NOVEL.  Hopefully I'm not the only one who caught that.

The filmmaker (especially if he or she is a fan) will do their best to make a great movie.  However, they know, as we all should, the what we see in our minds when we read the book and what we see on the movie screen are going to be different.  Get over it.  If you want that to change, start making your own movies.

GoF was beautiful to look at and fun to watch.  Necessary cuts had to be made, such as the Dursleys and Winky/Dobby.  I think the cuts and their replacements were well thought out and still paid respect to the general story.

GoF is a fantastic movie, but it was an absolutely amazing novel first.  You are allowed to enjoy both for what they are --TWO SEPARATE THINGS!!!

Although this is the best Harry Potter movie yet (with the first Harry Potter a VERY close 2nd), I missed several of the subplots that the book provided. The analytical side of my brain did notice that some seemingly unrelated scenes were added merely to portent events in the fifth and sixth movies. I thought it unfortunate that several major characters got almost no screen time. Having said that, my spouse (who quit reading the series during the second book, but who has seen all the movies) also thought that Goblet was very entertaining.

People who think this is a children's series of books don't understand that these are adult books about children. I'm really impressed that Rowling is maintaining her writing excellence. Many writers, once they achieve popularity, don't.",1137024000,,913,4.928571428571429

I like them all, but the darker they get, the less I like them. Goblet of Fire is no doubt entertaining and interesting, but one of the things I liked in the first two movies was the character development and friendship of Ron, Hermione, and Harry - and Hagrid. There's not much of that in Goblet of Fire. I'll definitely buy this DVD when it comes out, as I have all of the others. My favorite Harry Potter movie so far, though, for what it's worth, is Chamber of Secrets.",1136851200,,610,4.177966101694915
2505977,3,B000E6EK3S,"The book HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE is my favorite in the series so far. However, when I first learned several years ago that they were planning on making movies from all the books, I thought to myself that there would be no way that they would be able to do GOBLET OF FIRE. The book is massive (tally in at over 700 pages) and unlike the fifth book in the series, there really isn't a whole lot that can be cut without losing crucial elements.

Nevertheless, the filmmakers did an extraordinary job of bringing the novel to the big screen. All of the critical elements of the story are shown and there is some character development (if you consider how the story has unfolded from the 1st movie) because Harry and his friends are growing up and maturing which presents a host of problems they never had to deal with before. The special effects and makeup are quite extraordinary (the Quiddich World Cup is briefly seen and Voldemort looks like and embodiment of evil, especially since he doesn't have a nose). Even the acting is good, especially considering everything else that is going on.

Yet, the movie itself is lacking. The first two movies were able to stand completely on their own as films. You could watch CHAMBER OF SECRETS without ever having seen SORCERER'S STONE and still enjoyed the movie and known what was going on. That was less so with PRISONER OF AZKABAN and with GOBLET OF FIRE it's pretty much impossible. If you haven't read at least one of the books are seen one of the previous movies, you probably will not enjoy GOBLET OF FIRE too much. Sure it has some pretty exciting things (flying dragons, cruel merpeople underwater, an sinister villain of pure evil), but for those who aren't familiar with Potter and his worlds, it will take at least 1/2 the movie just to figure out which characters are which. In that sense, GOBLET OF FIRE isn't a great movie because it cannot stand alone and neither is the movie a part of a trilogy (aka STAR WARS, BACK TO THE FUTURE, or LORD OF THE RINGS) or a quartet. It is part of a series, but in a series, each film has to stand alone on its own and if it doesn't it becomes a cardboard fantasy (ala many of the James Bond movies) and loses what meaning it has. In short, though the filmmakers did a great job of adapting the book to film, the story really is too massive for one movie to tell properly.",1136332800,,2376,4.434782608695652

It was as dark as ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" and is more scarier than the first three.

2505979,4,B000E6EK3S,"It must be difficult to decide what to include and what not to include in the Harry Potter movies.  The books contain so much story, so much detail, some of which must be left out.  This leaves the fan wondering why certain things were not included.  If a bit of everything is included, then the film appears to be one of the highlights of the story; only certain events are covered in detail.  The latter is the case in The Goblet of Fire.

There are points in this film where several things are hinted at, mentioned, glossed over, then it moves on.  Still, it is immensely satisfying.  The actors have improved, and there is less childish wonder, especially on the part of Harry.  The relationship of the three friends has become stronger because of the trials, both between personalities and in fighting to deal with Voldemort.  The special effects are wonderful, yet do not take over.  The screenwriters, director, etc., remain true to the original story, at least in its feel and those details which are presented.

No one will be completely satisfied with what is included or left out.  The movie is quite long enough as it is.  On the whole, it is very satisfying, perhaps the best one so far.  It would help if more attention was paid to the atmosphere -- in the background -- so that the viewer would feel more strongly lodged within this world of Hogwarts.

My son enjoyed this movie a lot, although he always is frightened by Voldemort.  This movie is definitely for children age 9 and above.

2505983,2,B000E6EK3S,"With each successive movie the argument that this is not the right medium to tell the Harry Potter story gets stronger and stonger.  I think everyone who worked on this film did a good job working in the constraints that a movie offers, but sadly the heart and soul of the story and the world it inhabits is not faithfully represented.  The biggest problem - time.  There simply is not enough time to give the texture and depth that the book does.  Way too much of the story had to be dropped simply for time.

But then odd decisions like including Rita Skeeter in the film when her entire point for being there is not in the film make me pause and wonder what these people were thinking when they did this hack job.  Another misstep is the menacing and aggressive acting and look of Dumbledore.  This is a character who is zen-like in the books.  Light-hearted, quirky and warm with a quiet strength and power that can pierce you with just a look and a presence.  This is not the Dumbledore we see in this movie.

None of the Harry Potter films have lived up to to the promise of the books, and this fourth film is no different.  This is a Cliffs Notes version of the story told a bit sloppily and with little care for the source material.",1135814400,,1240,4.324675324675325
2505984,3,B000E6EK3S,"I never was a great fan of Harry Potter, but it happened so that I watched in theaters all of ""his"" movies. And I might say they are rather good. I was never disappointed, it's a good entertainment and I always liked to watch it especially in theater although I don't go to the cinema often. But the forth film was my first disappointment about Harry Potter. There's a couple of spectacular scenes with great visual effects, but in general the movie is rather boring. Nothing happens most of the time, they just talk, talk and talk... But it's a film for kids for God's sake! There are some storylines that end up just nowhere. For example all the lines about possible romantic relationship between Harry and his new girlfriend, between Hermione and her boyfriend, between Hagrid and his lady... All these lines develop during the film, but when it ends, seems like they never existed. Nothing is said about how they all ended.
It was written everywhere that the forth part would the be the scariest. Well, I haven't noticed that. To me the second and the third were by far terrifying.
And the last thing - all the Potter movies were rather long, but here two and a half hours seemed truly endless, because the picture itself was dull. After first hour and a half I was thinking: ""C'mon, it's time to round up, it's a movie for kids, for God's sake!"".

2505987,5,B000E6EK3S,"How do you turn a 700+ page novel into a movie? Well, you either make a 4 hour movie or you cut, cut, cut and turn into a 2.5 hour movie. The filmmakers decided on the latter because there was no good splitting point in the novel to make GOF: Part I and GOF: Part II. What we end up with is the absolute core of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Gone is that side plot with Hermione forming S.P.E.W. and trying to bring freedom and equal rights to all house elves. Gone, actually, is any appearance of a house elf. So, no Dobby in this one despite the role he plays in the book. The early scenes of the novel dealing especially with the Quidditch World Cup are cut very short, nothing at the Dursleys, and we do not get to learn much about either Krum or Fleur.

What do we have, then? Harry starts out with the Weasley's as they go to the Quidditch World Cup. The match isn't shown (though the entrances are, so we know Krum is famous) and after we see the attack at the Q.W.C. by the Death Eaters and the Dark Mark being released in the air. I have to say that there was a serious sense of menace and fear and confusion during the attack. Very well done and shows hints of why the Death Eaters (followers of Voldemort) are that scary. From this moment we know things are changing. Year 4 for Harry, Ron, and Hermione is now beginning back at Hogwarts, but this year is going to be different. The Tri-Wizard Competition is being held at Hogwarts and each of three wizarding schools will have a champion competing for Eternal Glory. It is only open to those over the age of seventeen, however. The three champions are chosen: Krum, Fluer, and from Hogwarts - Cedric Diggory. But then the Goblet of Fire glows red once more and spits out a fourth name: Harry Potter. So, Harry must compete in this competition which has caused death in the past and Harry doesn't have the experience or the knowledge. Meanwhile he keeps having visions and dreams about the return of Voldemort and his scar is hurting.

This movie is far more streamlined than the book. School, Voldemort, Competition. That's it. Nearly everything extra is cut. And you know what? It works. Azkaban may have been a stronger movie, but Goblet of Fire is still far better than the first two movies. There is a real sense of darkness and menace to the film as we know that the series is just going to get darker. I didn't feel like anything was missing from the movie. All of the side stories which build the richness of the world would not have fit in the movie and would have killed the flow and tension of it. The only lack is that there is little or no development or information about Fleur or Krum, or even Cedric though a little bit more is given about him. We do get the little love interest of Harry for Cho Chang and the boredom of the Parvati twins at the ball is perfect. But the main story here is the Tri-Wizard Competition and Voldemort, and it works well.

After each Harry Potter movie I always wonder how they are possibly going to film the next one and have it work, but I look forward to it because the movie series is turning out to be quite a good one.

2505988,3,B000E6EK3S,"This film was good as a standard Hollywood action movie.  The scenes were impressive and the movie didn't feel long.  However, after enjoying the first three Harry Potter movies, I have to say I was disappointed with the screenwriting in this one.  I was looking forward to seeing the characters in the book come to life.  Alan Rickman is excellent as Professor Snape--deliciously nasty, and yet never the actual bad guy.  That Alan Rickman was reduced to play a small part-which I can only describe as slapstick humor-is a shame and waste of talent. As well as a departure from Snapes significant roll in Harry's day to day life at Hogwarts.

The depth of feeling and friendship between Hermione, Harry and Ron which made POA so wonderful (displayed simply by a touch of hands or a couple well said words), was completely lost here. The silliness of their humorous scenes moved these characters almost towards being caricatures.

Where was Maggie Smith's chance to continue the rich supporting roll of McGonagall?  Professor McGonagall is important in the books and remains so in the later episodes.  She provides depth and character to Harry's life.  Her roll was also much reduced.

GOF emphasized action over anything else.  I missed the Weasley family, and I missed the interplay between all the characters.  Even Viktor Krum, the highly anticipated new character, was reduced from someone intriguing to a dumb jock.

In my opinion, all the action and humor that was made up (not in the book), should not have taken the time that could have been alloted to real acting from a roster of very talented actors who have been with the HP movies from the beginning. It certainly would have kept the movie more true to the book.  There is enough action and humor in the book to make a good movie, without making up extraneous scenes.

In short, with the teen actors maturing fast, and the adult actors consenting to continue to collaborate, I think this movie missed its mark and a chance to be a great sequel using the original cast.",1135296000,,2032,4.7793696275071635

2505990,4,B000E6EK3S,"A few weeks ago, on opening weekend, my fiancee and I went to see Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. All the cast returns, like old friends, but with all-new issues to face. In this installment, Harry and company have visited upon them the ""Tri-Wizard Tournament"". Harry, though too young, somehow gains entry into the tourney. It is this competition that the story revolves about, with several trials to master, and a gala ball to attend--with a date!

For this is also the tale of young teens, trying to find their way in the world, and it always these years that are roughest. Finding dates can be a challenge, but understanding who one should really ask to the dance can be a bigger challenge.

As is typical in the Harry Potter stories, the thread of clues that something is amiss runs throughout the movie. Harry's entrance in the tourney is no accident, and is a necessary part of Voldemort's return.

Some of the details that are glossed over in the movie, but present in the book, are perhaps more illuminating than one might think. For instance, it has now occurred (or perhaps recurred) to me that The plan for Voldemort's return stretches back to the attack of the Death-Eaters at the start of the movie...an act which is portrayed well, but is then glossed over. The Tri-Wizard Tournament might not have happened without the Death-Eater attack. Unfortunately, due to time constraints, much of this is glossed over in the movie...the subject of the attack is not really returned to. Other topics are not really explored as much as they should be, either. The movie ran 2 hours 37 minutes...perhaps a stretch in length to 3 hours wouldn't have been so bad? After all, with a PG-13 rating, the youngsters with the small bladders wouldn't be in the theatres anyways...?

The movie is well-shot and has great special effects. The young actors have come into their own, most definitely, even the supporting cast members. The Phelps brothers, playing the Weasley twins, supply great comedic support, and Matthew Lewis, who portrays Neville, shows strength (which is good since he's likely to be a much more important character in the future than we yet know).

The movie is definitely worth a look. Just remember, it is possibly best viewed as a ""companion"" to the book, highlighting areas of interest, showing something of JK Rowling's thoughts, but not covering the matter in great depth.",1134777600,,2398,4.824817518248175
2505991,5,B000E6EK3S,"OK we are now on the forth book. To be honest the Harry Potter phenomenon might have lost it's storm taking novelty but backed by a pretty well thought through story and a tightly knitted plot, the charm of the Harry Potter is now beyond just a popular children's book.

Anyone who had read the book will know the story is getting darker and darker and there hasn't been more unrest inside the hearts of the teenagers now in the books. Goblet of Fire presented itself as a book in a dictionary size for kids to read and the plot had gone deeper than ever. The difficulty of tackling Goblet of Fire is not how to present the stunning visuals but deciding on what to put in and what to leave behind, yet the story could still tie in to the plot of the previous three instalments.

The Director this time did a brilliant job putting in as much as possible while made good decisions on what had to be left on the pages. We did not see the end of certain characters as we did in the book but that doesn't matter. The story is as complete as ever. Growing up can be said as a very important part of Goblet of Fire. The innuendo and curiosity of teenagers that is in the process of coming to age was tackled brilliantly with a lot of innocent humour. The screenplay was very well written as it was not easy at all. Performance wise, the 3 main leads did see a bit of improvement but not as promising as they showed in the last movie. Emma Watson did a better job as Hermione among the 3 while the boys looked like they are trying very hard to grow up as an actor. Luckily their shortcomings were well covered by the skills of the Director, Editor and Screenwriter.

Goblet of fire definitely is a very enjoyable movie though at times it might be too dark for kids. With a story so well written it is difficult to get it wrong at this point but the work will be even harder for the next two books. It is a movie that you won't mind watching it again and again at your leisure time, especially if you are already a fan of the series. Probably the DVD will be another hotcake for many people of the world when it is released.",1134777600,,2115,4.191646191646192
2505992,3,B000E6EK3S,"One of the things that disappoints about this movie is the lack of effort to make Barty Crouch Jr.'s elaborate deception look credible.  Apparently the filmmakers decided that all people have read the book anyway, and already know that the man who claimed to be Mad Eye Moody really was Barty Junior, so why bother?

In the movie, even if you haven't read the book, you know right away that Brendan Gleason is going to be THE bad guy.

Lest anyone forget, the Harry Potter stories are really detective stories.  When the carefully hatched deception gets washed out in the movie, the magic is lost.

The movie does earn some points for expanding our view of the magical world, the Quidditch World Cup stadium, the triwizard tournament grounds, etc.  which go far beyond the usual Hogwarts.  But even here, there's nothing we haven't seen before from the annual Super Bowl, or ""Gladiator"" or ""Lord of the Rings"".  (And really, if the magic folk were as clever as they think they are, why are their tournament names so muggle-like, you know, like ""World Cup"".  How unoriginal.)",1134604800,,1074,4.762162162162162
2505993,4,B000E6EK3S,"Considering that ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is a huge and sprawling novel, and when taking into account the fact that it really ought to have been a 2-part movie - to cover everything - it's quite a pleasant surprise to find that this movie, even though it's missing much of the content of the novel that spawned it, is still pretty excellent.

The basic plot follows our heroes - Harry, Ron and Hermoine - as they begin their fourth year in Hogwarts school of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and are caught up through underhanded means in the TriWizard Tournament - a sort of inter-European school competition to find a Wizarding champion. Across a series of three tasks, Harry must defend both himself and the pride of Gryffindor against naysayers and would-be assassins, and uncover not only the prize, but the mystery behind his recurring nightmares of the evil Lord Voldemort.

Firstly, in terms of performances, here is absolutely the best Harry Potter movie to date. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are all maturing into fine actors, capable of far, far much more than they were just a few short years ago when the first movies were released. Watson and Grint are particularly good here - the romantic tension between them is nicely played, and Grint gets to flex his long-ignored acting muscle in his scenes of argument with Harry. Other great performances come from Frances De La Tour as Madame Olympe Maxime (again, a visually perfect rendition of JK Rowling's original descriptions), Miranda Richardson as poisonously sweet reporter Rita Skeeter is joyfully comical and wholly watchable, and Brendan Gleeson as Alastor Moody gives a solid performance in what (I think) is his first major film role that's not serious drama. Katie Leung and Ralph Feinnes shine too in their respective roles as love interest Cho Chang and evil nemesis Lord Voldemort.

Direction here is superlative; where its predecessor ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"" was dark and moody and a little thin in terms of visual splendour, I challenge anyone not to be amazed when they see what wonderful Mike Newell has managed to do with a severely adapted screenplay. The Death Eaters are actually creepy, and the Triwizard Tournament challenge scenes - particularly the Maze and subsequent fight - are jaw-dropping. The opening scenes at the Quidditch World Cup are hackle-raising good, and the whole feel of this movie is one of directorial mastery and a real affinity for the subject matter. I don't know about you, but I'd certainly be happy for Newell to helm the remaining three movies.

My one complaint - and it's an unavoidable one - is that while cast and crew alike must be applauded and respected for delivering the most satisfying Harry Potter movie to date, outside of the original, it still lacks too much information from the novel to really jump off the screen. In fact, friends of mine who had not read the book needed clarification on a number of more minor plot points, and, while this is not a major complaint, nor does it necessitate a bad review, it does leave one wondering: 'Okay, the movie is more than 2 and a half hours long, why not tack on an extra 30 minutes and really tie up those loose plot ends? "".

Still, where ""Chamber of Secrets"" and ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" failed, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" succeeds on almost every count. It's an excellent movie, and an excellent visualisation of one of the most enjoyable Harry Potter novels to date.

Thoroughly recommended, and roll on Movie No. 5!!",1134345600,,3544,4.83993399339934
2505994,3,B000E6EK3S,"First I must say how surprised I was at just how dark it was, right off the bat. It was not a happy looking movie, which is ironic because it was the most entertaining of the films so far, but I wouldn't say it was the best one, Azkaban had alot more going on with the emotions of the characters, especially Harry and just had more...umph to it and more plot.

I realize this probably is because of the fact that a 700 page book was turned into a 2 hour and 45 minute movie, but still, this movie seemed to be missing something... or alot of somethings, as anyone who has read the book can tell you. As a film, it just didn't grab me emotionally the way Azkaban did, or even Chamber for that matter. I'd say its my 2nd favorite overall film in the series, and I really enjoyed myself watching it, but I was also disapointed it didn't continue the growth of Harry's character like Azkaban did. I mean, yes, he starts liking girls and all, and the end was VERY dramatic (I cried of Cedric), but do you understand when I say I was expecting more?

On the good side, it was funnier than the others, largely because it needed to be because of how dark it was, and because they're all essentially entering high school now and the teen angst humor the series has so desperately been missing has finally arrived. To be fair, I didn't even realize it was infact missing until after watching this movie. The weasley twins were great, and I loved how Hermoine gets put in the awful, and very cliche posistion of delivering messages between arguing friends.

Because it was so edited (although I loved not seeing the dursleys, I'm sick of them) both Ron and Hermoine seem like they have nothing to do in the movie. Especially Ron, which was unfortunate because, as w/ Harry, Azkaban had really stretched these characters out and made them seem more real and likable and then this movie has them in the shadows.

I know I seem to be trashing the movie, but I was just left wanting more... emotionally. The action was the best of the series, and the dragon sequence rivaled LOTR, but in the end it was basically a movie about a tournament and not the 4th year of school in these characters lives that I've invested so much in so far, u know? So that was disapointing, and yet I would give the film a B+ easily.

So, overall it was an enjoyable movie with some obvious holes and about 40% of the book missing, especially in the end which will make it interesting to see what they do w/ ""order of the phoenix"" in 2007. It was fun, just not as plot-driven as azkaban. Or as good.",1134172800,,2562,4.329166666666667

I felt that the relationship between them was real and believable in that movie...and thought that is was somewhat missing in this movie.  It may have had a lot to do with the pacing of the movie and the fact that it was a lot of story to fit into a 2 hour movie.

2506000,3,B000E6EK3S,"Go through the soundtrack listing before reading this review, because the former spoils everything there is to spoil.

While not necessarily the most vital feature of the `Harry Potter' films, one of the most important considerations is perhaps the feel of each movie, which is one of the most immediate things that strikes an audience.

In terms of that, as the series progresses, each part has become sturdier in achieving an all-round sense of completeness, in that every instalment gradually moves towards being a singular film in its own right while taking rich pickings from a world, whose continuity and consistency have been respected and admirably maintained, reconceived for the silver screen in what will ultimately be seven parts.

The first movie was atmospherically very lush, with rich hues of red and gold that both conveyed the wondrous regality of Hogwarts and gave the film an aptly warm, seasonal touch that maintained a sense of comfort in the world our young protagonists found themselves in as well as for the young audience, and, of course, mirrored the cheery Christmas movie-going period. The second saw a darkening that was tentative at best, giving it a more grimy, dull and sapped feel rather than a truly menacing or ominous one. The Gothic turn in the third demonstrated what that darkening should have accomplished, in addition to matching the mood of the third book, which, strange as it may sound, lent itself to the colour purple. `Goblet of Fire' then suitably attains a lovely palette that might have been filtered through a window in spring, bringing about a tightly textured look that doesn't suffer from an effluvium of colour, ranging from the autumnal compound of the castle to the shadowy blue of a graveyard. The feel of the fourth film must have been the most difficult to figure out out of the movies made thus far, but thankfully they've gotten the onscreen setting right for the cast to thrive in.

Because of the need to keep the central narrative of the Triwizard Tournament going, the script appears to offer very few opportunities for introspective or emotionally resonant performances such as those that we saw in `The Prisoner of Azkaban'. Although, this is in no way to undermine Steve Kloves's valiant effort as he manages to hit all the marks fans will be looking for, even if newcomers will be absolutely puzzled (Priori Incantatem, while mentioned, is never explained for one). Director Mike Newell, in addition to marshalling thrilling action sequences, extends the emotional range of, in particular, the young cast. The supporting ensemble of British thespians, however, gets more character moments as well, which in their own subtle way suggest flaws, fallibility and even occasional quirkiness. Be they Professor McGonagall's amusing absent-mindedness in informing Harry about a dance, the clumsiness of the lovably bumbling Argus Filch who can never seem to restrain his excitement in lighting a cannon, or the brooding anguish or severity of Professors Snape and Dumbledore, facets of our favourite characters never before seen render them more conceivable, human personas, and prevent them from degenerating into amusing two-dimensional plot devices. It is, however, always a treat to see great actors so sportingly partaking in what others may see as a childish premise that insults their talents.

Michael Gambon's performance demands some examination. While his portrayal makes a combination of both probable sincerity and twinkling playfulness believable for Dumbledore with a line like `I hate these drapes, burnt them down in my fourth year...by accident of course', one occasionally gets the impression of him engaging in broad strokes to lucidly form what still seems a flailing character of sorts in his hands. His performance appears to be straining towards a quality reminiscent of the understated sternness and gentle sense of humour that Richard Harris gave Dumbledore, who became in the first two films a thoroughly imagined onscreen character, clearly formed around the edges, as it were. While this reviewer still looks forward to more of his intriguing characterisation, one hopes that Dumbledore will be able to evoke the sympathy that his fate in the sixth instalment should bring about.

Everyone is talking about Ralph Fiennes, and for good reason, for his proves to be an inspired bit of casting. His Voldemort is one who vacillates dangerously between quietly maniacal malice and uneasy pleasantry. It makes for a discomfiting, unnerving and unpredictable mix, and the unsettlingly understated volatility of his character comes through, rendering the threat posed by his sheer presence all the more palpable. One thing surprising perhaps about his portrayal is the relative absence of the haughtiness one could glean from the book, that sense of superiority derived supposedly from being both a pureblood wizard and an immensely powerful one. Far from being the charming, refined and demonstratively supercilious young student depicted in `The Chamber of Secrets', the adult Voldemort seems to have been roughened around the edges, so to say, his appearance and manner reflecting his abasement by his heinous exercises in his pursuit for power, which, one should note, likely inflicted a great deal of pain upon himself. That that road to his own misguided notion of greatness was trying comes through in Fiennes's portrayal, and what emerges is a new kind of charisma and leadership, one that sees him identifying himself with and operating amongst, and therefore as one of, his men, who then find it easier perhaps to relate to him and recognise his authority in their group. In addition, his demonstration of his newly acquired ability to touch Harry by touching his scar is an example of a judiciously dramatic stroke that's emblematic of the discreet and well-measured theatricality with which Fiennes imbues his performance. Indeed, one does seem to behold, as Fiennes graces the screen, quite a magical concoction of elements coming together in a personification of evil that seeks to be as true to that dark essence itself as possible.

But back to the young cast. Harry's progression from a mild, well-mannered young boy to a gangly, moody teenager, likely the result of embitterment or dispossession due to everything he's experienced thus far, has been well pulled off by Radcliffe, who demonstrates consistency in his performance here following an edgier turn in `The Prisoner of Azkaban'. The danger here is for his character to tumble into blandness, and fortunately the occasional emotional moment, such as his crying over Cedric's death, while not completely convincingly performed, prevents that. Discussing Harry at this point naturally brings in Moody, and while Brendan Gleeson's is a no-holds-barred demented performance, it's never really endearing even when his character turns cheeky (sticking his tongue out at McGonagall, for one), and one doesn't get a sense of a relationship as compelling as that which Harry shared with Lupin, or for that matter as that depicted in the book, and thus there is no strong feeling of betrayal when the revelation regarding Moody comes, unlike the momentarily startling instant in the previous film when it seemed for a moment that Lupin had been in cahoots with a supposedly villainous Sirius Black.

Grint goes through much of the same as Ron, which is a shame because it wouldn't harm having him express some manner of emotional response to Harry's precarious predicament instead of always leaving Hermione as the sole good friend who emotes realistically over the dangers posed to Harry. Watson does stand out as the spirited young woman, but one gets a sense this time that, while admirable that she strives for a more demanding emotional range, perhaps she tries a little too hard and her performance sometimes comes off strained. However, it is evident that Newell has tried to suss out the nuances that are possible in the characters' interaction with each other, hints subtly conveying unspoken thoughts or veiled feelings that, while perhaps best not explicitly expressed, run on into and are thus discreetly revealed by the discourse that they engage in. The weight of the demands that his acute and observant direction entails in this sense rests mostly on Watson, and, again, while occasionally awkward, she invests a credible effort.

The supporting young cast deserves their share of good mention. The Weasley twins are a highlight in this instalment with an effortless comic chemistry. A scene where one of them asks a girl to the Yule Ball wordlessly is a hoot. Felton in the role of Malfoy is sportingly and nicely deplorable again, as is Isaacs in a welcome return to his role as Draco's father. A little more of Longbottom's back-story would have been nice, for his feeling disturbed by the Cruciatus curse is never clearly explained. It also appears to be Ginny Weasley's turn to blossom into a beautiful young woman; and the other Triwizard champions are all a refreshing presence.

This is a very funny movie. Aside from the Weasley twins, the main trio turns in occasional comic moments. In fact, it is precisely comedy that prevents Ron, who effects most of it in his interaction with Hermione, from remaining a character who merely sulks. The character of Neville is given a more substantial showing in this movie, and Matt Lewis is winsome as the blossoming nerd. Shirley Henderson's appearance as Moaning Myrtle is a scream, and her morbid ghoul is a gem of macabre humour. A lot of the laughs here are rooted in the film's premise. While we are thoroughly aware that we are dealing with a fantastical world and story, lines like `We do not use transfiguration as a punishment' still manage to sound amusingly bizarre.

For every moment of comedy, though, is another that is disturbing, and in realising these moments the designs for imaginary conceptions in particular stand out. Two brief but utterly memorable images that demonstrate the melding of technical deftness with imagination are that of an uncomfortably twitching spider on which the Cruciatus curse is inflicted, and a passing view of Voldemort as a hideous foetal creature. Iconic moments are captured competently, and in particular the golden dome that forms about Harry and his nemesis and the emergence of the spectres of Voldemort's victims when Priori Incantatem finally occurs is an exciting and, yes, spellbinding sight that is really quite marvellously achieved.

But the real treasures in this movie are the intimate moments that pertain entirely to character, as preciously few as these treasures are. Those who were perhaps unsatisfied with the relatively upbeat and childish conclusion of the third movie should be happy that there is quite a proper emotional resolution in this one before it ends, appositely, sombrely. The script makes the effort of an eulogy for Cedric (which alludes also to tensions with the Ministry of Magic, and that, along with passing mentions of the Department of Mysteries, teasingly and alluringly foreshadows `The Order of the Phoenix'), after which the movie reaches its final scene, which is its best. As Harry walks through a corridor along the edge of the courtyard, he looks with consolation at the students from various schools bidding affectionate farewells to each other, a sight from which he derives a heartening reassurance that, as Dumbledore tells him, he is not alone in this fight, and there is friendship that he, and everyone else, can count on, and which therefore must be kept strong. Our three friends standing silhouetted against the evening light on a balcony as they watch the departure of the Beauxbatons carriage then makes for a lovely, reaffirming sight. It's moments like this that serve as a reminder that, even amid the dragons and mermaids and evil sorcerers, there is a heart to this story, and it is very much alive.",1133913600,,11934,5.139546858908342

2506003,2,B000E6EK3S,"After the wonderful Prisoner of Azkaban, I was really expecting something great with the new direction the Harry Potter movies were taking. How wrong I was.

The pace of the plot in this movie seemed to be all messed up. In the beginning it was moving too fast, then it moved too slow, then it seemed to never end. The events of the TriWizard Tournament were the most disappointingly, uneventful games ever. There was never a sense of danger or even an understanding of the dangers involved by Harry becoming involved in the tournament - just lots more of those stunned Harry Potter looks of ""I cant believe this is happening to me"" which are becoming a little too boring now.

I was also disappointed in the character development of the lead characters. The book really opened up the relationships of the four characters and helped forge them towards the fourth book. Alfonso Cuaron did a great job doing this in Prisoner of Azkaban, but Mike Newell didn't quite get it right in this one. I am sure there are people who say they did a marvelous job scripting a 700+ page book to screen, but let's face it, half the book could have been edited down too and still had the same punch; and the movie could have still delivered well constructed characters and scenes without having to go for hours upon hours.

The score was equally unimpressive even though it was in the hands of Patrick Doyle. I don't know the reasons why John Williams left, but I hope he returns for the next one. Also, I hated the 'rock' tunes in this movie. They will date barely in the next few years. Composers who work on classics should remember not to put in tunes that will date!

Entertaining? Maybe. Passable? Yes. As good as Prisoner of Azkaban? No way|!",1133654400,,1732,4.541666666666667

Is that the month they think is best to release it, it also returned to IMAX screens. So can possibly the 5th movie hit IMAX screens? This is also the first Harry Potter movie to be rated PG-13, and when I first heard of this, I didn't believe that it would rated it, but I knew it will do well at the box office, and has done it so far, even Harry Potter film opened #1 in its first weekend at the Boxoffice, so it might be unlikely that that will change. Now with the films get more and more dark, you might even have to look for a flashlight to be able to see the movies.

And yes Harry Potter swears that he didn't enter himself, now soembdoy better tell him not to swear, this is all found out when Harry Potter gets picked along with Cedric Diggory, to attend, even if the age barrier is broken, which not only angers Dumbledoor, but Harry Potter's best friend Ron Weasley.

2506005,4,B000E6EK3S,"I haven't read any of the Harry Potter books.  Just so you know.

I heard, anecdotally, that fans of the book were not happy with the movie, so I didn't expect much.  I ended up liking this installment the most out of the series.

By now, everyone knows what the plot is about: Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) is entered into a contest deemed too dangerous for boys his age, the Tri-Wizard Tournament.  Two other schools are invited to participate--near as I can tell, they're French hot girls and brutish Russian guys--giving some much needed variety and depth to a world that's mostly taken place in a stuffy little school.

A lot has changed.  We have a new Master of the Dark Arts, Alastor ""MadEye"" Moody (Brendan Gleeson), with magical eye patch, mechanical leg and all.  Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) finally starts acting like a person instead of a benevolent incarnation of Father Christmas.  He gets mad, he freaks out, and he sometimes appears to be a big hippy.  Heck, even Rubeus Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) gets a little romance.

Speaking of romance, the movie doesn't focus on the character interactions so much that it feels like we're watching a soap, and that's a good thing.  Mostly, it's the awkwardness of learning social graces that terrorizes our poor students.  You know, the things that haunted the geeky among us to this day: asking girls out, wearing ""cool"" clothes, knowing when to dance and when not to dance, and discovering your female friends are becoming women.

The terrifying trials that constitute the Tri-Wizard cup keep things moving.  Behind it all is that pesky Voldemort (a marvelous Ralph Fiennes) who breathes life into a villain who has been entirely two-dimensional for too long.  Not any more!

Even the special effects have been upped.  Kids on broomsticks no longer look like bad CGI.  The dragon battle even looks fantastic.  In an age of Lord of the Rings, that's saying something.

What was most satisfying to me was the feeling that Hogwarts is now a real school.  Teachers worry about students getting hurt (there's an age limit on the Tri-Wizard Cup for a reason), argue over disciplining their charges, and fret about teaching styles.  This is a real school with real problems, even if they're magical problems.

That said, the movie occasionally sacrifices rationale for speed.  At one point, several characters are intentionally placed in grave danger as part of the Tri-Wizard tournament and everyone's supposed to be okay with it.  Unfortunately, that kind of contest cheapens the tragedy of loss felt later--it's hard to muster up tears when someone gets hurt after Hogwarts basically kidnaps its own students in the name of competition.

Still, it's a forgivable quirk that my wife tells me is explained in the novel.  With all the action, crazy characters, and burgeoning relationships, Harry Potter has now moved into the realm of adulthood.  Maybe that's why I liked it so much.",1133481600,,2943,4.948979591836735
2506006,3,B000E6EK3S,"The third movie installment for the third book of the HARRY POTTER series by J.K. Rowlings The Prisoner of Azkaban is a great improvement ever since director Chris Colombus stepped out of the door for the directorial possition in the series. From that point on I realized that movie adaptations are thus: movie adaptations, and would not necessarily need to be completely derived every step of the way from its basis. The only thing that would matter then now in that regard, is how the execution of the said movie adaptation (or 'movielization' if you will) went out. Thus the said third movie- delivered a great execution of the third book from the Harry Potter series, although it's not that completely faithful within every scene to the HARRY POTTER book. And furthermore, I believe that the french (?)director Alfonso Quaron from the previous installment THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN to the movie adaptation for this here J.K. Rowling's HARRY POTTER series did a better job than to Mike Newell - who is thus the new (no pun intended) director for this fourth installment to the series - THE GOBLET OF FIRE.
As for the stars, my how the kids have indeed grown, apparently (ooh) Emma Thompson, who plays Hermione Granger. For Albus Dumbledore, again we have Michael Gambon playing the part since the previous installment replacing the late Mr. Richard Harris, that although his performance of the Principal Proffessor of the Hogwarts School for magic and wizardry is not that bad - there is a certain touch of Mr. Harris' performance of Dumbledore that I quite miss, perhaps a little lesser activity in Gambon's acting would do.

And thus to speak of this fourth installment in the series- The Goblet of Fire, I felt it did well at the start with its continuity against the book's backdrop.
Hence the plotline goes- HOGWARTS is to embark on to sponsor the annual wizards tournament wherein each representative is assaigned with a superior for the tournament - hand-picked of sorts by the cup known as the GOBLET OF FIRE, which also serves as the portal..er, I mean the trophy as well by the one who would win in the tournament. Hope I won't spoil anything out- but i guess its quite a hell of a lot help to've served me well that I had another momentary lapse of memory regarding Moody's role (who seem to have a bad case of mystical rheumatism of sorts) who comes as the one to serve as Potter's coach. Speaking of which - it's the vile mystery that Potter's name got included on the Goblet's drawn-out names to play in the competition- when Harry being still yet a minor, got included among those that submitted their names, being that the game does not entitle those that are under age to join in and submit their names for the tournament. And thus, it entails for Potter's reputation tarnished, and even loose his bestfriend Ron in that respect.
However, the purpose of the Goblet's the one detail that remained in me head from having the book read sometime ago (when it was just released then), and I do recall some scenes are not included in the movie- while some of the scenes that are in the flick do not constitute those that are in the book , nor do i recall to've read any of those scenes that appeared for some in the movie. Save for the climax (not that its anything on par with climaxing sequences from THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK mind you) - I felt that this time the movie is quite levelling on to some crappiness now, mainly on the prom-like scenes, although those could've been executed quite better... and mainly they're coming to the point of trying to pull out some petty 'cutie-ness' that appeared quite unabashedly pathetic.
Anyways, the movie is not all that bad - if only that darn cinema where i watched it hadn't got the faint yet audible crackles by the right channel of the speakers (in some digital stereo), which I did quite similarly the day after I've seen THE EXORCISM OF EMILY ROSE, that actually turned out to be a court-room drama, about yet-another demon-possessed victim based on a true story, which might've been better than it turned out to be, however grand it is in the way the flick is executed. Twas a wholesome demon-possession family flick of sorts. Quite a good ride actuially.

All the more in passing - I guess space in time just gave me the notch to read the 5th and 6th book in the series before its next movielizations came out. Watching the movie renditions could also serve as to jog your memory about the books as a review of sorts if you've read them for quite some while ago at the time now.",1133395200,,4543,4.61433868974042
2506007,5,B000E6EK3S,"Going into watching this movie, I, just like everyone else, knew that there would be things cut out. I mean, turning a seven hundred page book into a two-and-a-half hour movie was going to leave people unhappy. But it wasa  better idea than making two different movies, which was their original idea. Putting that aside, I thought the new director did a good job with what he had to work with. Granted, things were left out that many people would have wanted to see, like how Harry left his home to return to the Burrows, or SPEW, which was more comic relief than anything else. Beside that, good movie, plenty of action, and plenty of surprises.

Now, with regard to the rating, people should have seen it coming. I've heard many people complain that the movie is too violent for kids. Well, try reading the book. The book is violent too!!! To eliminate this aspect would upset even more of the devoted readers who knew that this happened. The first two books were more happy, but all the other books get darker and more people die. The director did the best he could, and I agree with the rating. Odds are that all the movies from now on are going to be rated PG-13, especially for readers who know that books 5 and 6 are very dark and very violent.

Where Chris Columbus spent perhaps too much effort trying to make the first two movies carbon copies of the books and that other guy sliced and diced Azkaban, Newell took everything that really needed to be in the book and brought it to life beautifully.

In fact, I really liked the fact that the filmakers attempted to put a little bit of closure on the story.  It was always just a little bit frustrating that the novel just ended.

Purists should expect to be disappointed, but for the rest of us (especially those thouroughly disgruntled with the adaptation of Azkaban), this is one not to be missed.",1133308800,,857,4.568627450980392
2506009,5,B000E6EK3S,"Dark times lie ahead for Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe). Harry has a bad dream about Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) returning which is interrupted when Hermione (Emma Watson) wakes them up. They are late. Ron (Rupert Grint) and the rest of  the Weasley family are taking a vacation to the Quidditch World Cup. One night, the appearance of the Dark Mark and Death Eaters who destroy everything in their path, causes everyone to flee. Soon, the children are back at Hogwarts and Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) announces the school will host the prestigious Triwizards Tournament. One representative from each of three schools, including Hogwarts, will compete.  Anyone who wants to compete needs to put their name in the Goblet of Fire, which will choose the competitors. Victor Krum, representing the Bulgarian school, and Fleur Delacour, representing the French school are chosen, along with Cedric Diggory, a Hogwarts student. Excited, everyone prepares to leave as the Goblet spits out a fourth name, Harry Potter. All of the Professors are in agreement: the rules are clear; all names issued by the Goblet of Fire are to compete. The new Defense of the Dark Arts professor, Mad Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), takes an interest in Harry, helping him through some tricky situations. But Dark times lie ahead for our hero.

""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"", the fourth film in the series, is also the longest book to date. There were some plans to make the book into two films, releasing part 1 in the summer and part 2 in November, but director Mike Newell, with input from Alfonso Cuaron, the director of ""Harry Potter III"", decided to do one film, eliminating many of the smaller subplots.

""Goblet"" is, so far, my favorite book in the series, because there is so much going on, so many different things for everyone to contend with. And I was more than a little weary when I heard they were only making one film. It didn't seem possible to cram all of that material, even after eliminating some subplots, into a respectable film. But director Mike Newell (""Four Weddings and A Funeral"") and screenwriter Steve Kloves (""Harry Potter 1, 2 and 3"") have done a great job incorporating a respectable portion of the book into a fast paced film. When the film was over, I honestly didn't feel like I had just watched a film that was over 2 and  hours long. It seemed shorter than it actually was. What better compliment can there be?

There are a number of other reasons that this is, so far, the best film in the series. Chris Columbus received a lot of kudos for starting the series, but the first two films were just okay. They were certainly faithful to the book, but weren't magical. Everything seemed to be marched out, to appease fans of the books, to make sure everything on the ""checklist"" was taken care of. The series really began to develop in the right way when Alfonso Cuaron took over the reins and made ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"". Cuaron helped the tone of the darker book remain intact and added a lot of great flourish to the story. Newell takes this a step further. As the kids get older, the books keep getting darker, more dangerous and a little scarier. Newell has created the darkest film of the series, matching the feel of the book to a tee.

Another reason the films get better with each installment? The three leads are getting older, learning more about their craft, becoming better actors. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint have matured enough that each can act in a fairly natural way. They have always been good, but they are finally becoming good actors. Rupert Grint as Ron, in particular, seems to be relying less on facial ticks, exaggerated mannerisms, and shouting  to convey his character than he has in previous films.

It also helps that each of the young actors is dealing with something that most of us can relate to: the onset of puberty. One of the events associated with the Triwizards Tournament is a ball. Therefore, Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) gives the students in her house dancing lessons, leading to many of the students asking, indeed recognizing, the opposite sex as possible dating material for the first time. Ron is particularly smitten with Fleur Delacour, but is also interested in Hermione. Unfortunately, he is unable to come out and ask her. Harry is interested in someone as well, but by the time he gets around to asking Cho to the dance, she has already accepted an invitation from someone else. This is, perhaps, the best part of the film, because it is the most grounded in reality.

Every film has a `guest star', a well-known actor or actress who will end up making one memorable appearance, the equivalent of TV's ""Love Boat"". ""Goblet""'s guest star is Brendan Gleeson, as Alastar ""Mad Eye"" Moody, the new Defense of the Dark Arts Teacher. If you are an avid fan of the books, you know that Hogwarts has difficulty retaining its Defense of the Dark Arts Professor, allowing a series of memorable actors to take over the role in each new film. Gleeson is very good and very memorable as a professor with one artificial leg and one artificial eye who has taken the job at the request of Dumbledore. He is a bit of a ham, but the character is supposed to be crazy, off his rocker, mad, so it works well.

Of course, there is another actor making his debut in the series. Ralph Fiennes appears in a few scenes as Lord Voldemort. Harry's nemesis should, naturally, be a memorable addition to the cast and Fiennes doesn't disappoint. He brings a quiet intensity to the role. Featured primarily in the finale, he is quiet, yet scary and doesn't do a lot of shouting and screaming to make his character seem menacing. Merely existing makes him scary enough and all of his subordinates know this, grateful to see him alive again, yet cowering because he could deign to take their life at any moment. He is able to convey the evil of his character very effectively.

Miranda Richardson is also quite effective as Rita Skeeter, the muckraking journalist who begins to cover the story of Harry Potter, writing whatever she pleases.

""Goblet"" is rated PG-13 and it could be a bit scary for some of the younger fans. This is both a blessing and a shame. The rating is more than appropriate for the tone, allowing Newell and Kloves to stay true to the material. They don't have to water anything down to meet an artificial PG. Because of this, the film feels authentic. On the other hand, this darker tone and feel makes it harder for young fans of the series to continue watching the films, which seems a shame, to exclude a certain portion of your demographic.

The special effects are also great. They add a lot to the Triwizards Tournament; dragons, merpeople, moving hedges, making everything seem as real as possible, given the fantasy elements at  play in these scenes. I honestly couldn't spot any problems with the special effects, something that would signal that CGI was being used to create this or that fantasy world. Of course they used special effects, and a lot of them, but the quality was so high they seemed natural.

My one complaint is that the actors who play the core group of professors are starting to get short shrift. Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and Robbie Coltrane seem to be pushed further into the background with each new film. They each have one or two memorable scenes, but they aren't nearly as prevalent as the characters making their appearances in each of the films. Rickman does have a great scene, perfectly reestablishing his menace, and he doesn't speak a word. Smith has a memorable scene attempting to teach the children to dance. And Coltrane has a fun subplot as he romances the female head of the French school, a woman who is at least eight feet tall. It seems a shame that these great actors are not as prevalent as they could be, because they provide so much depth and interest.

""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is a great addition to the series and a great film for the whole family. Adults who read the books will love it as much as the children.",1133222400,,8101,4.693661971830986
2506010,2,B000E6EK3S,"I went to see Goblet last night, and was impressed by how they managed to keep almost all the violence of the book, but very little of the joy of the story.

Although this book was much darker than the previous ones, and the movie rightly reflects that, the book was more than just violence.  The book delved into the feelings and lives of the characters.  The movie however, seemed focused on the action.  I didn't mind the film editing some of the smaller story lines, but in the process of keeping the length of the film down, they managed to leave out all the reasons that we love this world.  Dumbledore was short tempered, yelled loudly on a regular basis, and seemed harsh with the students, so unlike the gentle and strong leader of the books.  Ron had none of his usual endearing charm, and Hermione had none of the brilliance that we have come to love and respect.  The movie is covered up with amazing special effects, most notably the dragon scenes, but has left out all the things that really make your heart beat faster...love, loyalty, friendship, and trust.",1133136000,,1073,4.557291666666667
2506021,5,B000E6EK3S,"I don't know why this film gets so much flack, it's an excellent movie and an excellent interpretation of the book. People whine and gripe that certain things were cut out or changed around a bit, but to them I say: GET OVER IT! Sometimes things that worked in the book won't work on film, why can't people realize that?

This one is quite a bit darker and mature than the previous films, and is rated PG-13. There is some murder, blood, and torture involved. It also deals with the pain of losing a child, a man cuts his own hand off, and, since the kids are growing up and beginning to discover the opposite sex, there is also some innuendo. And there are some pretty creepy scenes taking place in a graveyard.

The three teen actors have all greatly improved over the years. Rupert manages to be more serious and subtle while still providing enough comic relief. Daniel does an excellent job with some very difficult emotional scenes. His Harry is much more sarcastic and under a lot of stress this time around. The adult actors are truly an all-star cast. Not only is there Ralph Fiennes, Jason Isaacs, and David Tennant (the new Doctor Who) as villians, we also have Dame Maggie Smith as the stern but fair headmistress, Michael Gambon as the wise headmaster, Brendan Gleeson as the creepy, eccentric Defense Against The Dark Arts professor, Miranda Richardson as a pesky yellow journalist, and Alan Rickman as the sinister potions professor. Also along for the ride are Shirley Henderson, Roger Lloyd-Pack, Eric Sykes, and Timothy Spall. An impressive cast, indeed!

The soundtrack is also excellent. ""The Story Continues"" is new, more dark and intense take on the traditional ""Hedwig's Theme"". ""Harry In Winter"" is an absolutely gorgeous track that plays in a few different forms in various scenes, ""Do The Hippogriff"" is a very catchy Billy-Idolish rock track from the popular wizard band The Wierd Sisters (actually performed by Jarvis Crocker and members of Radiohead), ""The Dark Mark"" is deliciously sinister, and you can really feel the excitement while listening to ""The Quidditch World Cup"".

All in all, it's an excellent film and without a doubt the best in the series so far. I doubt that they'll be able to surpass this one.",1133136000,,2242,4.800518134715026
2506022,5,B000E6EK3S,"All right, we all wanted to see every single moment of the book on film.  We wanted to go into that pensieve and see the entire episode with Barty Crouch Jr, and we know that Bartemius Senior is a real jerk and his son was totally insane, but he begged his father to save him, masking his evil tendancies.  We know that Dumbledore never yells at Harry.  In fact, Dumbledore never yells at anyone.  He doesn't have to, because even you-know-who is afraid of him.  We wanted to see Hermione and her SPEW.  We wanted the dance scene to be better.  In short, we wanted the entire masterpiece we've come to love, on the big screen.

I'm sorry, but it's huge.  It's a big book, and most people don't want to sit in a theatre for seven hours.  I probably would, but I am what is know as a Harry Potter freak.

The movie was really good, considering they had to cut it short.  The only complaint I have was with Dumbledore.  He was crazy in this.  Absolutely crazy.  I hated it when he put his hands around Harry's neck.  Other than that, I felt this movie did a very good job with the time constraints.  There were some new scenes, like the part where McGonagall teaches the Gryffindors to dance, and they were pretty good.  That scene was actually very funny, and as a side note, Fred and George got more air time, and Weasley twins equal a good time.

Basically, you should be able to enjoy the film, even though they cut the Quidditch World Cup game out, and there are no House Elves.

Please give this movie a chance, it's worth it.  I'm just going to hope that the same director has signed on for Order of the Phoenix, because if Cuaron signed up for that one, I'll be siding with the movie haters yet again.",1133136000,,1706,4.285266457680251
2506023,5,B000E6EK3S,"I love Harry Potter and everything about it! The books are all complete works of art. They are brilliant and pure genius!!!! The movies though have been another story. The first two films were extremely dissappointing in nearly every way. Goblet Of Fire is such an improvement though in every single way. The graphics are much improved compared to the horrid graphics of the first film. The book itself is one of the favorites and is extremely long, so of course many things had to be removed. Hermiones elf rights movements and the dursleys for example were thrown out. But the movie sticks with the plot perfectly and keeps a quick and exciting pace.

One of the most improved things in this film compared to the first ones is the acting. Daniel Radcliffe has become such a great actor and star I can't help but be proud! In the Sorcerors Stone he is bland and twitchy (watch his winking) in Chamber of Secrets he was just embarassing and Cring worthy, in Azkaban he improved but still was far from perfect, In Goblet he finally is perfect and great!!! Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are great in this film as they have been throughout the series as well as the stong supporting cast featuring a brilliant Ralph Fiennes and of course the always great Maggie Smith and etc... But Dan Radcliffe, who is becoming a teen hearthrob on his own is the definite greatest acting improvement, his crying scenes are great and believable.

The movie was soo impressive and a relief for me as a Potter fan that I just had to see it three times its first week in theaters. The movie is exciting with its dragons scene and underwater challenge, it is funny with its hilarious british humor with the twins and most surprisingly the movie is so freaking sad!!!! I cried so hard toward the end!!!! Its such a powerful film I would watch this than any of the over rated LOTR films anyday!",1133136000,,1869,4.559523809523809
2506024,4,B000E6EK3S,"I must confess that I was disappointed with the latest Harry Potter movie (Harry Potter & the Goblet of Fire.)  This is the fourth book in the fantasy children's series by JK Rowling about the orphan wizard.  Do not be fooled however, this movie was really not for the little ones with it's PG-13 rating.  The 700+ page book is a much darker adventure for Harry and his friends.  The movie was true to the book in that respect.  In fact, I believe that it was too dark.  The book did have some happy, funny moments that could have been mentioned in the movie.  The director, Mike Newell (Four Wedding and a Funeral) could have made better choices.

I know that they had to cut a lot to make the movie two and half hours. The movie just hit the high points and didn't go into much detail about what was happening.  I have to ask myself ""Did JK Rowling give her okay to these cuts?"" If she did, I have to wonder why she did so because there was so much that she explained. I would not be very happy with this one if I were her.  Is she just doing the movies because audiences want it? I would hope she'd want to be faithful to what she created instead of setting for something less than her vision!  .

One of the redeeming qualities was the special effects. They were awesome but where was Quidditch??  They show the stadium and bring the players out for the Quidditch World Cup, a very big deal to the wizarding community and a big part of the book. As I have read the books and watched the movies, I really look forward to the Quidditch matches.  Why make an awesome stadium and not show the game??  It was a letdown for me. I am very leery of the next movies in the series.  My advice read the books before seeing the movies. You will get a much better sense of what is going on. The movie gives you a good abridgement of the story without the details.",1133136000,,1854,4.194915254237288
2506025,3,B000E6EK3S,"This movie represents a return to the standard, formulaic Hollywood approach to movies, after the more ""indie"" film quality of the third movie.  Lots of special effects, lots of close-up mug shots of people showing us the emotions we should be feeling, people doing stupid things that we're supposed to find funny (Hagrid guiding the flying carriage in like he's on an aircraft carrier, and almost getting run over in the process).

So much of the character development is done in a formulaic manner.  On the train ride to Hogwarts, Hermione tells Harry to write Sirius a note.  All well and good, except it came across so mechanically, and lacked the sort of warmth and ""magic"" that you'd expect.  The way Ron and his brothers behave in the tent after the world cup was painful to watch.  Maybe that's how they would behave, but why put that sort of junk footage in a film that is cutting out so many more essential bits?

So many of the special effects are in the foreground.  We're treated to overly long shots of the dark mark in the sky, the leprechaun formation at the world cup....  And almost always one or more of the big three is required to do a mug shot showing gape-jawed awe (at how much money just got spent).  In the past it was usually poor Ron who had to play that part.  Now they've got Harry doing it (at the insides of the tent at the world cup, at the appearance of the dark mark).  Calling so much attention to the special effects makes them less special for me.  Special effects are best when they're done in the background, providing depth and realism to a scene.  Sure, a few big-ticket effects can take center stage, but those should be rare, not an every-other scene kind of thing as is done here.

I hope that the fifth movie will be more like the third.  But maybe these later books are just too big, too involved.  Maybe it's impossible to translate them successfully into a 2-3 hour film.  Certainly, if we continue to get Hollywood trained and approved mainstream directors, we can expect more cotton candy fluff, loud noises, flashing lights, and not much in the way of characterization, acting, or atmosphere and depth.",1133136000,,2154,4.565104166666667

An example being the end of the Yule ball when Hermoine and Ron have one of their usual squabbles. Hermoine reminded me of a mother figure especially when she demands that the go to bed. But they don't resolve it this movie. And what was up w/ the scene where Harry is w/ Murtel in the prefixes bathroom? Most of the scenes were random and had no connnection to the movie as a whole.

2506027,4,B000E6EK3S,I read every Harry Potter book and seen all the movies. So far all the movies have been pretty good and close to the books. This one is no exception. It is pretty close to the book except for some parts. There should have been more death eaters in the graveyard and some obstacles in the maze. You don't see all of Dumbledore's memories and don't know why Mr. Crouch dies(my mom and brother asked my why). Rita Skeeter is part of the beginning of the movie but disappears at the end. She doesn't seem as big a factor as she was in the book. Neither do the other schools. I would have liked to seen the other contestants get their golden eggs in the first event also. And was it just me or did the movie seem like it skipped parts.,1133049600,,730,4.147887323943662
2506028,2,B000E6EK3S,"I know the Potter-philes will wail, but I suspect many simply don't know better.  For quite a few, they've read little else, especially of classical fantasy, and their exposure to great films and great acting is probably limited, too.

So, knowing that I'm inviting much disagreement:

Our young hero, Harry Potter, finds himself at the center of strange doings, conspiracies, evil lurking behind every doorway ... all the while played by an actor with the emotional range of a teapot.  Sad, really.  To be sure, there are some nice performances in some of the smaller roles, and an endearing fellow (who shows about as much personality as anyone in these films) with a wandering eye who eats up the scenery.  But, our three brave heros suffer at the hands of school play-level rejects.  I couldn't help but wish, as I watched this patchwork film with the crummy acting, for Spielberg's version, in which he insisted on Haley Joel Osment--a phenomenal young talent--in the lead role.  Spielberg has his hits and misses, but Osment would have been phenomenal.  Ah, but it's a fantasy--a brutal one, indeed--given what we're left with in real life.

The authoress can't complain, either.  She's the one who nuked the Spielberg deal on the grounds that she wanted British kids in the lead roles.  I wonder if she included a stipulation that they have no acting talent, as well?

It's hard to appreciate the story in light of such a grand set of flaws, but there is entertainment to be had ... and when the only character you develop any affection for turns out to be a villain ... well, you can't get any better than that, in my book. In fact, that's one of the features of this film that stands out.  The ""good guys"" are bland as melba toast.  They're the kind of ""by the book"" nerds that would likely populate any snooty prep school you might find: bland, risk-averse whiners, and teachers who have the creative energy of tadpoles.  You can't help but want the whole damn Hogwart's to be set afire ... blown up in some great magical conflagration.

So here's hoping the next one is rated R and magical nukes take center stage.",1133049600,,2125,4.684636118598383
2506029,3,B000E6EK3S,"After seeing this movie i was dissapointed.  However, upon reflection, the film was really not that bad. A few minor changes could have taken the film from mediocre to very good.  The begginging of the movie was well done. The first task although it varied from the book was action packed and fun to watch.  The second task, also was very well done. The actors who played the newly introduced characters were very good, in particular that of mad eye moody.  Moody's magical eye,  however was obviously fake and did not look realistic at all.

  At the beginning of the third task the movie began to turn downhill.  In the maze Harry faced no obstacles whatsoever. The maze closed around the competitors occasionally but  there were no creatures, such as the memorable sphinx or the giant spiders.  Even this could have  been over looked had the scene in the grave yard been properly made.  The setting was good.... and the scene were voldemort was spawned was acceptable, especially considering that it was nessacary to accomadate child viewers.  Voldemort however was done poorly.  Those who remember the second book can easily calculate to realize that the dark lord should have been close to the age of 70.  the voldemort we saw had smooth skin and bright blue eyes. His voice was needed to be slighty raspier, his current not is almost femmine.  The biggest change to voldemort was most certaintly his blue eyes. In the book, his eyes are red. Although i am not a great star wars fan, the makers should have taken a clue from the eyes of anakin skywalker in the revenge of the sith. Most dissapointing was meek amount of death eaters present in the graveyard. 6 or 7 showed up, compared to what harry thought was over a hundred.  This really took away from the perception of a powerful , infuential dark lord.

The movie lacked a summery which dumbledore provided at the end of the books and the films.  There was no summary of events which left those who have not read the book confused and those who had dissapointed.  Elements were not introduced such as the ministries disrespect for harry and dumbledore. Whcih probably will lead to more cuts  in the next film",1133049600,,2169,4.667546174142481
2506030,5,B000E6EK3S,"The Harry Potter series of books is one of the best I've ever read.  With only one book left to be released in the seven-book series, fans everywhere are on pins and needles to see what happens next.  J.K. Rowling's world of witches, wizards, magical schools, muggles, and dragons has the entire world bewitched.  The movie series, on the other hand, isn't as good (though there are very few movies that rival their printed sources in quality).  I was not a huge fan of the first two movies.  I very much enjoy the third movie, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, seeing as how the dark tone of the film, under director Alfonso Curan, was a huge departure from Chris Columbus' shinier portrayals in the first two films.  However, seeing as how these books are massive (Goblet of Fire is the second-longest to date at about 730 pages), stuff has to be cut out.  This is definitely the best Potter film yet, and though it does have its faults, the overall result is very magical.

For the two of you out there who haven't read the book (and I am not exaggerating; the previews GAVE AWAY THE ENDING because the folks at Warner Brothers know that everyone who is going to see it already knows how the book ends), here is the story.  In Harry  Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasly (Rupert Grint), and Hermione Granger's (Emma Watson) fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, an old tradition is being reintroduced.  The Triwizard Tournament is coming to Hogwarts.  The tournament used to be a traditional event for three magic schools to come together to build friendships and competein very astounding (and very dangerous events).  The number three is a recurring theme in the tournament; there are three schools (and therefore three champions), as well as three events.  Due to the intense nature of the tournament, Hogwarts headmaster Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) makes it a rule that only students who are at least 17 years old can enter.  So it comes as a big surprise to everyone when, not only does the Goblet of Fire, the magical recruiter for the tournament, not only chooses 4 champions instead of 3, but the fourth is none other than 14-year-old Harry.

Harry is forced to compete in the tournament (binding magical contract), and must do tasks that are difficult for even the seventh-year (eldest students) champions.  But while the tasks are a burden to Harry and his fellow champions, they do wonders on the eyes of the audience.  The dragon battle is fantastic to say the least, and while the scene at the end in the graveyard, while not part of the tournament, is a wonder to behold.

Furthermore, the new Defense Against Dark Arts teacher, Alastor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody (Brendan Gleeson) begins teaching the students very advanced, very illegal magic, in order to show them what they will have to ward off in the Dark Lord Voldemort is ever to return.  Furthermore, Moody takes a great interest in Harry, which may or may not be to the advantage of the young wizard.  Gleeson is great in the role of Moody, providing drama as well as comic relief.

Now, there are a few problems.  This was a long book, so a lot of subplot had to be cut.  While a few things I'm ok with that they cut (like Hermione's equal rights for house-elves campaign), there were a few things, like Rita Skeeter's full plot and the deaths of the Riddle family that I'm very upset to see didn't make the film.  Also, we didn't get any Quidditch; while we saw the intro to the Quidditch World Cup, the film cut away before the game actually started.  Which brings me to another point; a lot of the cuts in the film seemed very abrupt, but with a long story and only 2.5 hours to tell it, I guess it can be forgiven.

A lot of major characters were reduced to footnotes in the film, especially Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) and Prof. Snape (Alan Rickman).  The other big character problem was Fleur Delacour (Clmence Posy); she was one of the opposing champions, yet in the film, she did not seem like champion material.  She was very beautiful, but I didn't buy the idea that she was the greatest witch her school had to offer.  On the plus side, we got our first glimpse of Cho Chang (Katie Leung), who is beautiful and has an amazing accent.  Finally, Ralph Fiennes did a great job with his character (though I won't tell you who he was, but you probably already know).

Overall, this was a great film.  Potter fans everywhere will most likely enjoy it, as long as they can separate the movie from the book.  People who have read the books (all 2 of you) will very much enjoy this film as well.",1132963200,,4598,4.580684596577017

The benefit about reading the books together each night is that i can skim over parts of the book that I think my 8 year old will find disturbing. I was a little bit nervous bringing my son to his first pg-13 movie and in retrospect i probably should not have. Those of you who have read the books know that the Hogwarts kids are growing up and as the do the stories get darker and much more frightening. There are certainly parts of this movie that I kept my hand over my son'e eyes because even though i knew they were coming, were very visually graphic. That being said, GO SEE THIS MOVIE. it was visually fantastic and just as you imagine everything to be while you read the story. As one other reviewer mentioned, there is an extremely sad scene during which i was bawling my eyes out My son did NOT have any nightmares and really enjoyed himself, but if you are the parent of a young child either skip it or get your child ready for the fact that you may need to

cover his/her eyes!

As with the Prisoner of Azkaban, this movie is not a book with special effects, and that explains why not every little detail is in the movie. A Harry Potter movie does not need every thing written in the book to be good.

The hungarian horntail is perfect, the mermaids where very good and the laberynth is like: WOW! ""You Know Who"" is great and he is perfect for the character described by J.K.Rowling. And Moody is just like in the

book, crazy and funny.

2506046,4,B000E6EK3S,"This movie was almost as good as PRISONER, but it lacked a certain something.  Possibly it is too ambitious a movie and the viewer gets lost at so many different points, especially a dimwit like me who didn't read the Rowling book on which it was based.  Luckily I went with a young friend who knew all of the story backwards and forwards.  I would lean and whisper into his ear when I was confused, and he always had the answers for me, thank you Marcus, however if it was a perfect movie you wouldn't need a youngster to sit by your side and fill you in like the ""daimons"" in the Philip Pullman novels.

That said, I was amazed at the richness and sweep of the visuals, right down to the smallest and most difficult of details.  We saw this show in its IMAX presentation, here in San Francisco, and even across the two hundred foot screen the movie changes from minute to minute, first an intimate detail, like the rain drops blowing down the face of the stained glass window so it looks like tears--very beautiful, that--to the tournament events, especially the razor back dragon in the first challenge knocking Harry off his makeshift broom and onto the gables of Hogwarts.  Many of the scenes were set in pitch black, and yet you could still make out the important things that the film-makers wanted you to see.  (Contrast this with the Cuaron PRISONER, where even the scariest scenes were generally laid in the sunlight--maybe things are even scarier when it's NOT dark?)

Harry, Ron, and Hermione were all good, although I couldn't understand for a minute why, after saving the world three times already, everyone turns on Harry just because he MIGHT have put his own name into the Goblet of Fire.  Especially because we see the Weasley Twins cheating up a spell to get their names under consideration and the whole cast is cheering them on, hoping their cheating will pay off!  Then you see everyone (except Cedric) wearing those comical ""Potter Stinks"" buttons and I'm, like, ""no way.""  No way would Harry be so unpopular, and why does no one believe him, not even Ron his best friend?

Oh well, Marcus explained to us that in the novel it was more believable because Rita, the gossip columnist, had used the power of the media to rip holes in Harry's credibility.  While Miranda Richardson proved to be a very beautiful and comically adept Rita, we never saw this aspect of her character.

How beautiful the scene when Sirius Black speaks to Harry in the fireplace, his face a moving mask of flame and wood and ash?  You've never seen anything like it in a film!  That's why we keep going back to the Potter movies, and that's why, when all seven are done and no more in the pipeline, I'm going to have myself a good cry just like a pane of stained glass in a bad storm.

And how much of a perve is that Myrtle!!!",1132876800,,2823,4.503921568627451
2506047,5,B000E6EK3S,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, could have been longer. The book version was more intense and the film version left some of it out. The film was much smoother in transitions from one scene to the next, but the film lacked the magicalness of Columbus first two films. As a whole, the film was very

well done.",1132876800,,313,4.305084745762712
2506048,4,B000E6EK3S,"I absolutely love anything Harry Potter and of course I loved this film.  However, I felt that it ""ran"" by me.  I feel as though I have to see it again to truly absorb it.  My husband noticed things I didn't.  I understand editing for the sake of time, but the dragon scene was not the way it happened and took up time that could've included Charlie Weasley or the Dobby/Winky storyline.  I didn't like the S.P.E.W. story in the book so I can live without that, but Winky could've been shown, as should the older Weasley's who will be in the Order in the next installment.  The Yule ball was pretty good because that is the way Harry and Ron actually handled the dance.  I was hoping that they would show the disappointment on Ginny's face when Harry finally asks her and she has already promised Neville.  If you did not read the book, you think that Ginny actually likes Neville.  The one line reference to the Longbottom's needed to be developed to show why Neville was freaked out be the Cructias Curse.  Also to remind viewers that Avada Kedavra is what killed Harry's parents.  The Voldemort scenes were good as were the comic antics of the Weasley twins.  However, Dumbledore was never that out of control and poor Hermione looked as though she would have a nervous breakdown.  Also when he and Ron were fighting she chose Harry over Ron's immature reaction-He hung out with Seamus and Dean.  There was not time taken to explain the veela factor and not all of Beauxbatons girls (where were the boys?)  were veela, only Fleur. The world cup went by too fast.  I did not like what they did with the maze, rather than give obstacles, they made the maze come alive and change people rather than show the various tasks within the maze.  The underwater scenes were very well done!  I though those were eerie and engaging.  They also stayed fairly close to the book.

I know that realistically speaking, they had to cut down on scenes, but it is hard for a real fan of the books to see parts or the story or people ignored.  I like this book the best because of the World Cup and the Tournament, so I was looking forward to it the most.  On a whole, I was not disappointed.  I definitely think it deserves 4 stars.  The special effects were awesome.  I love the fact that the actors have remained the same.  Daniel Radcliffe is so cute and Emma Watson gets prettier every film.  I can't imagine anyone else being Ron other than Rupert Grint.  I even like the fact that the ""extra"" student actors have grown up in front of us.  Oliver and James Phelps are so funny and I am looking forward to five and six where they have more air time ( I hope). I do miss Richard Harris, who in my opinion really captured the Dumbledore character, no offense intended to Michael Gambon, who is also doing an excellent job by showing the eccentric side of Dumbledore. The scene with Snape shoving their heads down was funny.  The Snape and McGonagall characters are represented wonderfully by the actors-who of course are outstanding and very experienced.  I did not like the Sirius in the fire scene-I did not expect the ""floo powder"" to show someone almost on fire. I liked the use of small cupboards throughout the castle and I felt that Harry crying and clinging the Cedric's body was well done.  I am looking forward to seeing it again and of course to the Order of the Phoenix in 2007.",1132876800,,3375,4.4640522875816995
2506049,5,B000E6EK3S,"As a mother of a ten year old daughter, I highly recommend this entertaining film. Many moral issues are explored which can become conversation-starters for parents and children/teens. The visual effects are stunning, and virtual scenery is beautiful. The kids in the film are growing up before our eyes and seem concerned with their version of everything ""teen"" (their looks, school, friends, dating, morality). A bit frightening and even sad in places, but nothing my ten-year-old couldn't handle. Go see it Moms! You'll enjoy everything about it!",1132876800,,549,5.32183908045977
2506050,3,B000E6EK3S,"While the movie's editing was rather choppy and some of the story wasn't developed, a lot of Hollywood tripe entered the movie unfortunately.  As Cinematography and SFX were excellent, they dwelled on things that weren't worth the time (such as young girl's butts) and cut on things that were interesting.

Readers of the book will understand and probably feel the same way as I do about the movie; however non-readers will be very confused as distracted by the people getting up from bathroom breaks to keep with the storyline that wasn't well enough developed.

Many will be wondering the following:

Why is it that Harry Potter's lipstick is brighter than Hermione and why doesn't he do something about those ugly glasses? Why does Hermione have a push-up bra on?

With all of the magic in the castle that can protect those from falling/repair broken limbs- etc. etc.  why does Harry even have a scratch on him- why can't the magic heal his skin?

While some of the highlights were the dragon fighting and Mad-eye-moody and the ending scene with Voldemort, the actually good actors were not shown:

Malfoy- both son and father were definitely unfairly given space in the movie...

Cedric Digory- the boy who dies wasn't featured enough for you to actually feel much pity when he died at the end because as choppy as it was we really didn't get much knowledge of his character... that could've been a really good ending scene if I had actually felt grief about his death.

The movie had too much of Harry running around, Cho Chang (nothing happened with that either), pointless scenes with random characters, too many shots of the students faces, and too many shots of what I will call 'Moody vision'.

The whole Neville Longbottom thing was pretty dumb for when Harry goes into the memory of Dumbledore his parents were hardly mentioned about going under the cruciatis curse, I think what's-his-face in the cage mentioned their names in his sentence... wasn't developed.

Dumbledore was a little more quirky- which was good, however he seemed to lose his temper towards the end, which rather surprised me.

Rupert Grint's over acting wasn't AS noticeable as in the second film, and as I will say again the SFX were great...

What's left, enhanced with CG, longer on action scenes plus the famous bathroom event ... you got the fourth movie of Harry Potter.

That's why I don't like this one as much as I like the previous three. Although it has many beautiful CG scenes but lacks in Rowling's essence. No time in between to explore other character (specially Hermione), no emotion stirred, no witty dialogs, no message conveyed, no thoughts needed just pumping adrenaline.

It is worth something only because of the main trio's improving act. No more. I understand of the time limit but at least cut down the dragon scene a bit to give other things emerged (waaay too outbounded as if it was expected that the duel with dragon would kill a student, with no older wizards as dragon tamers).

2506052,5,B000E6EK3S,"A tired, labored, breathy voice.  A small, rat-like man cowers in fear, while another looks on in awe at the thing the voice originates from.  A curious man looks on.  The thing with a breathy voice, noticing he and his band are not alone, utters a strange phrase and the curious man is awash in an eerie green glow.  Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) awakes from his nightmare, in a cold sweat and with an aching forehead.  So begins the newest ""Potter"" knockout ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"" foreshadowing the sinister events that will follow.

Like the behemoth of the book it is based on, dread is the theme of ""Goblet of Fire.""  Every movie has been building to the pivotal events that take place during Harry's fourth year at Hogwartz, when Harry, his friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) and his beloved Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) realize they are no longer safe, that things are no longer certain and that a great evil lurks in the shadows.  The troubles begin with the Triwizard Tournament, a magical contest between Hogwartz and two other magical schools.  A single student from each of them competes for their alma maters' honor, and during the selection ceremony Harry inexplicably becomes the second of the Hogwartz contestants.  When Dumbledore reads his name aloud, Harry sees in him a change.  Once his rock and protector, Dumbledore shows uncertainty, anger, and most forebodingly, fear.  Harry must now face three dangerous magical contests alone, without the safety net that has kept him relatively distant from harm and with no knowledge of what lies ahead, which turns out to be something out of his darkest nightmares: the resurrection of Lord Voldemort.

Veteran director Mike Newell guides the dark story with a sure hand.  The film, although a full two and half hours, flies by with barely a breather as it fleshes out the story of the Triwizard Tournament.  Newell also knows well enough to let the great cinematographer Roger Pratt work his magic.  Pratt, a Terry Gilliam favorite and ""Batman"" veteran, paints the film in shades of almost serene blues and greens, inviting the audience into the film, only to be swept up into the action and intermittent horrors of the story they follow.  Pratt and Newell shine in the films' handful of action sequences, and none are more convincing or exciting that the dragon fight, the first task in the tournament.  The Dragon awaiting Harry simply thunders with ferocity and terror, a triumph for the visual effects gurus behind it, who pull off countless other wonders throughout the film as well.

But ""The Goblet of Fire"" is not all darkness and technical achievement.  Director Newell also throws in something that his young cast has not seen before: teenage angst.  Only teasingly hinted at by Alfonso Cuaron in ""The Prisoner of Azkaban,"" Newell hits the adolescent ground running, humorously exploring the dynamics between the sexes in the teenage world, the petty rivalries that arise as well as the organic humor that naturally arise from the conflicts.  Harry and Ron's plight to find dates for the Yule Ball dance and their frustration at trying to figure out the mysteries of women are hilariously relatable to anyone who remembers being a teen.

Newell further works with his gifted cast, young and old, to put a human face on the magical intrigue.  Daniel Radcilffe gives his most confident performance to date, catching Harry's vulnerability and sadness as well as his strength.  Michael Gambon strips back the seemingly unflappable nature of Dumbledore to expose a man who sees events slipping from his influence.  Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have matured along side of Radcliffe and their experience comes through in two excellent performances as helpless onlookers to their friends' plight.  Ralph Finnes plays the most inhuman character, Lord Voldemort, with a seductive elegance that makes his malevolence hit that much harder.  And all hail Brendon Gleeson as the demented, out-sized paranoid Mad-Eye Moody, whose rantings and wickedly cool crazy-eye give the film a sense of levity to balance the oncoming darkness.  And it does in a devastating finale, one in which the Harry and his friends simply survive to fight another day, and one cannot wait until the next installment, ""Order of the Phoenix,"" rolls around sometime in the next couple of years.",1132790400,,4365,5.0069252077562325
2506053,5,B000E6EK3S,"""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is definitely the best of the movie outings to date: darker, denser, and more adult than anything we've seen on the screen so far. I'm beginning to wonder if Harry won't have to skirt the R rating by the time he turns 17; this one has more true terror and thrill in it than the other three put together, and that's a good thing for the franchise.

But apart from all this, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is a thought-provoking movie. For example, during the film I had several thoughts along these lines:

The Weasley twins are getting rather hot.

Daniel Radcliffe looks like Elijah Wood's psychologically-troubled kid brother.

Snape is exceedingly sexy when he smacks people.

Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort is like a panther. A muenster-cheese coloured panther.

Mermaids are cooler with shark-fins and dreadlocks.

Hermione proves that nerds can indeed be hot.

Dating and dancing can indeed be scarier than dragons.

The fourth and darkest installation of the beloved children's series is no longer really for children. From the very opening frames - which include skulls, a giant serpent, the execrable Wormtongue, and an old man biting the dust - the tone is far grimmer and more sinister than anything in the previous three films, and near the end there are some truly horror-inspiring moments. Such as when Harry asks the cute Cho Chang (who has a Scottish brogue - who knew?) to the Event of the Season, the Yule Ball, and is turned down. No, not really, but Harry and his comrades are definitely no longer the precious pre-teens of the first outings. There are monsters, enemies, and real challenges this time around, including the first terrible forays into the world of dating, and all this brings to the world of Hogwarts an ominous sense of foreboding that hasn't been there before.

The plot should be familiar to most anyone who hasn't been hidden under a rock in a jungle somewhere, so there's no need to summarize it, except to say that the Tri-Wizard Tournament - the sort of interschool championship that puts today's high-school sports to shame - makes a very useful structural element in ""Goblet of Fire."" Mike Newell, the series' first British director, wisely excises a lot of the extraneous stuff in favor of a tightly-focused narrative that focuses on Harry's attempts to make it through the Tournament alive, and on the attempts of certain others to make sure that he doesn't. This includes cutting out much of the sports action; there is a Quidditch match in this film - the Quidditch World Cup, played in a stadium that could probably be seen from outer space if not enchanted - but it is more of a cameo appearance and doesn't last long. There is too much other, more important, stuff to include to linger long on things like this.

This isn't to say that the world of Hogwarts is diminished by this; far from it. Newell's British sensibilities inform this area very well. I feel that this film is the strongest in making the school itself an element: this time around, the students actually look like students, hanging out in common rooms, inventing diversions, laughing at each other, and in general doing anything to keep from being bored. And while there are fewer of the sort of magical lessons we're used to, the addition of a new Defence Against the Dark Arts Professor more than makes up with quality what the film lacks in quantity. Brendan Gleeson's ""Mad-Eye"" Moody is not the sort of teacher you want to upset...probably not even the sort of teacher you want to have class with. But he's brilliant, and brings at once comic relief and a sense of discomfort to his scenes.

The visuals are refreshing as well: they don't feel like the whole reason for the film to exist, unlike Chris Columbus' two skin-crawlingly twee excursions. Instead, they support the story, showing us things that couldn't exist without special effects. The ones involving Voldemort and his Death Eaters are particularly effective: they look real in a surreal way, at times menacingly hazy around the edges and at others startlingly crisp.

Speaking of which, Lord Voldemort is probably the most compelling reason to see ""Goblet of Fire."" Much has been made of the casting of Ralph Fiennes as the Ultimate Embodiment of Darkness; after seeing ""Red Dragon"" I can't understand how anyone could object to his casting, but I don't think those objections will stand after this. He is like a panther: cagey and alert, perhaps seemingly calm on the surface, but always ready to strike. He seethes with unpredictability, and his appearance does nothing to reassure us otherwise: his head is shaved, his nails are long and discoloured, his cheekbones jut, his robes flutter like wispy wraiths, and his skin resembles, in colour and texture, nothing so much as muenster cheese. When he comes after Harry, there is true terror in the scene.

Perhaps most delightfully, though, Voldemort's voice is nothing like his horrifying appearance: it is crisp and cool, with the refined cadence of an Eton graduate. He is, essentially, the Ultimate Prep School Bully. There's something truly chilling about that...",1132790400,,5149,4.8764302059496565
2506054,4,B000E6EK3S,"The books are getting too long to come even close to capturing their spirit in the movie - perhaps breaking the movies up into terms? Could the dialogue cover even some of the important features of the book? I can't recall Draco hardly saying anything - though I liked him as a ferret, hardly any of Hermione's genius is present and the house elves are completely out - we miss the amazing arrival of Mr. Weasley picking Harry up. That would have been precious. Ludo didn't make the cut - we did not see Krum actually do anything at the World Cup! I think I even heard him call Hermione's name properly. Rita gets barely enough chance for us to notice her and JKR's critique on the press. Did anyone see any bugs? Worst of all, the whole emotional feel of the previous three movies is lost with the change in composers. Williams has a special voice and it communicates the emotion meant to be experienced in each scene. This movie has a different voice. The music is still beautiful and does the job but there is a bit of magic absent, about the same as when Richard Harris passed away and the special quality of his character went with him. But Williams is still with us thankfully! So what were they thinking?",1132790400,,1211,4.434977578475336
2506055,5,B000E6EK3S,"I always get worried with a new movie that they will leave out my favorite parts of the book.  I loved Book 4 it was probably one of my favorite books so far and I was so worried.  But even with leaving out a lot of the book this movie was amazing.  They highlighted on parts that you will need to follow Movie 5 if you are not reading along.  It was made so well that for 3 hours and 40 minutes I was caught up in Harry's world-just like the book.  I was sucked into the jokes, the special effects, and the power that Harry Potter and gang have.  If you like the first 3 go and see this movie if you have never seen a Harry Potter movie--no worries go and see this.  As a friend of mine who had not read the books or seen 1-3 kept up just as well as us.  A great movie for all.",1132704000,,778,3.7888198757763973
2506056,4,B000E6EK3S,"I have never read a Harry Potter book.  I'm a 42 year old man, who reads a lot of novels...but for some reason, never elected to read these, even though the rest of my family has read them all avidly.  I'm not a big ""fantasy"" book reader, so maybe that's part of it. But the nice thing about that is that I'm not constantly comparing the movies to the books.  All I know of the world of Hogwart's is what I've seen.

I've always like the movies, and I do believe in the conventional wisdom that they are getting better as time goes on.  The first couple boasted excellent performances and art direction and costumes, but the special effects were sometimes a bit hokey. (The multi-headed giant dog was pretty awful!).  Now the effects are generally convincing enough...and in GOBLET OF FIRE, the scenes with the dragon scrabbling on the rooftops and knocking off tiles are downright excellent.

But with GOBLET OF FIRE, the stories have achieved a richness.  Our main characters are becoming more interesting.  Harry, Hermoine and Ron have always been amusing and likeable...but so often, it felt like the people and characters around them were more interesting.  To me, in this latest film, Harry and his gang have emerged as truly well-rounded people.  Much of this is attributable to the fun scenes where our characters grapple with adolescence (crushes, asking a girl on a date, jealousy, etc.).  Now our characters are engaged in quite believable quandaries, not always magical ones.  They are rooted in a familiar reality, and yet can also take us on outrageous flights of fancy.

There is real emotion in this film.  When a key character dies, we can feel the anguish.  When tempers flair, it resonates.

Everyone in the film is terrific.  I look forward to the day when the three youngsters (or not so young anymore) finally have the time to try something else.  Hopefully they can break away from the Potter labels...because I suspect they will have some real acting chops.  Daniel Radcliff gets better all the time, and Emma Watson has real potential.  The other characters seem to have been given a little less to do this time out.  We see little of Maggie Smith or the delightful Alan Rickman.  Robbie Coltrane is good as always, and his character gets a love interest...something we didn't expect.  (At least, those of us who haven't read the books!)  I found myself thoroughly engaged in the film, and the 2 hour and 40 minute running time flew by.  My understanding is that the film left a lot out from the book.  I would gladly have sat for another 30 minutes or more to get more ""story.""  Too bad they didn't film a lot of extra stuff that could now be reinstated in the DVD, much like Peter Jackson did with some of this LORD OF THE RINGS films.

There were a couple of weaknesses, in my opinion.  I found the Tri-wizard Tournament a bit uninspired.  The best competition was the first, with the dragons.  The final leg of the event, set in the maze, was confusingly edited and filmed, and it wasn't always clear what was going on.  For such a climactic scene, it felt anti-climactic.  (Although the scene does segue into a meeting with Voldemort...that's a good scene!)  I also felt some of the ""politics"" of the movie were sketchy.  True, who was sent to Azkaban for what may not make the most riveting stuff, but it's the kind of exposition that is needed to make what comes later clearer and more invested in meaning.  And finally, I felt the Quiddich World Cup was short-changed.  We saw some awesome scenes of the stadium and the introduction of the teams...but no actual playing.  I think every film should have a little Quiddich.

Overall, though, this is the best of the bunch thus far.  Heck, I'm almost tempted to read the next book...that's how interested in the story I am now!",1132704000,,3807,4.6476761619190405
2506057,5,B000E6EK3S,"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is an amazing, long, detailed book as millions of people know. At nearly 800 crammed pages, it would have been nearly impossible to do a thorough film adaptation and keep it under 4 hours. All three Lord of the Rings books combined barely crack a thousand pages, so it's pretty clear how mammoth this story truly is. I myself would have no qualms about a four-hour plus version of this film, but remembering that this movie is not just for fans of the books but also the un-initiated, casual movie-goer, it makes sense why they abridged this into two-and-a-half hours. That being said and accepted, what a glorious two-and-a-half hours it is!

  Last summer, after enjoying the first two movies substantially, I absolutely fell in love with Prisoner of Azkaban and couldn't get enough of it, eventually seeing it six times at the theater and countless other times on DVD. Goblet of Fire is right on par with Prisoner, mainly due to the charm that resonates throughout both. These films, and especially the actors that play in them, perfectly capture the essence of these characters. Daniel Radcliffe is so dead-on as Harry it would be a capital crime to replace him at any point in this series. While he's a decent, improving actor, I actually prefer the fact that he's not a classicaly trained seasoned pro, as it fits the character of Harry much better. Rupert Grint as Ron has also improved, and I liked him much more in this one, even though Ron's mostly a whining jerk, Rupert plays it rather well. The real standout continues to be the absolutely breathtaking Emma Watson as Hermione. With each passing film, she gets more talented and more beautiful! Even though she has less to do in Goblet than last year's Azkaban, every time she's on screen the film is that much better. I can't wait to see her continue to progress, both with these films and hopefully future endeavors. Everyone else is great as well, the standouts being Brendan Gleeson who absolutely  nails Mad-Eye Moody, and Ralph Fiennes who's a natural for the deliciously creepy Lord Voldemort. My only gripe is that I still haven't come to enjoy Michael Gambon's portrayal of Dumbledore. While following Richard Harris was a daunting task for anyone to follow, Gambon admitted in a recent interview that he hasn't even read the books, and it shows as his Dumbledore only rarely acts like I imagined him. I hope he either reads the books before the next one or is replaced because the next couple chapters feature the character much more prominently.

  The effects in the film are fantastic as expected, and the movie moves very fast in order to at least show glimpses of crowd-pleasing book moments. It is definitely dark, and does that aspect effectively, but where this one truly shines is in the humor. The development of the young characters as they grow and mature and start developing interests in different things (namely the opposite sex) is played out wonderfully. There were several moments that had me laughing out loud. Some are actually that funny, and some are simply attributed to that fact that these characters are really that endearing, as are the actors. Patrick Doyle takes over musical duties from the great John Williams for some unknown reason, and while he definitely does a decent job, I hope Williams returns at some point (Doyle seems to mix Williams stylings with those of Danny Elfman, but never comes off as good as either).

  Overall, Goblet of Fire is a delightful, entertaining film that is, like the title of this review already states, about as good as it could have possibly been given an adaptation of this magnitude. Nevertheless, some book purists will still be up in arms over the things that are left out, as they always are. However, for those that can appreciate the limitations and advantages of both mediums and effectively enjoy both as separate entities, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is genuine cinematic magic that only a really powerful wizard could conjure!",1132704000,,4022,4.815942028985507
2506058,3,B000E6EK3S,"I am not a Harry Potter (HP) fan, but I like the first 3 movies and even read the 4th book and had been looking forward to the movie. However, I was somewhat disappointed about this movie. My feeling is that the director just rushed to show all the important scenes from the book like completing an assignment.  No character-building (especially Prof. Moody) and tension (like what we saw from the 3rd movie). Maybe my comments are a little bit biased because I only read the 4th book.

Let's face it. Adapting this huge book into a movie is a daunting task. Unless you follow ""The Lord of the Ring"" model, you will never have enough time to be loyal to every single moment described in the book. Though lots of HP fans want the movies to be exactly the same as the books, I personally don't favor this approach. The 3rd movie (The Prisoner of Azkaban) is an excellent example. Though it did a lot of changes to the original book, the storyline in the moive is intruiging. More important, this 3rd movie established the independent position of the motion picture version of HP to the original books. This 4th movie, however, lost this creative feature from the 3rd installment and became the prisoner of the book.

That being said, I do like several moments or characters in this movie. I like the character of the Dark Lord and the way he moved.  Like the scene of the rise of the Dark Lord.

In summary, I think the screenwriter did not do a good job adapting this thick book into a short but provoking movie. The director did a fair job.",1132704000,,1540,4.446808510638298
2506059,4,B000E6EK3S,"I, none the less, have found this film to be the most engaging of the lot and a welcome relief from the formulaic treacle of its predecessors. In fact, I was fairly prepared to pillory this film, but found instead that its darker edge and thematic touchstones profound. The film handles the finality of death more sophisticatedly than its cartoonish predecessors. Harry is growing up, and with the hormone changes and burgeoning sexual awakenings come a sense of mortality as well. Emma Watson, Rupert Grimes and Danielle Radcliffe will be tough to replace, as apparently they will be for the next film, as they have finally grown into the roles with a sense of gravitas that you don't expect from kid actors. If Radcliffe can shake his Potter role, he's likely to be a commanding presence in films. Hopefully they all fare better than Frodo.

As for how much of the book is abridged, that's not something I can speak to. I can only say that the film held together well, and will leave anyone with kids plenty to talk about, and for that reason it is an extremely worthy film.",1132704000,,1076,4.633507853403142
2506060,5,B000E6EK3S,"I walked into the theater expecting to see a great film, and I did.  ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is the finest film yet in the fantastic ""Harry Potter"" series, surpassing even the magnificent ""Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban"".  Mike Newell was an interesting choice to direct the film, but most definitely a great one.  In J.K. Rowling's novels, ""Goblet of Fire"" was the turning point where the series went from magical adventure to grim mystery - and that's exactly what Newell turns the series into.  He brings a not-so-magical, dark, grim feeling to the series, which is perfect for this film.  I hope David Yates can continue this feeling for ""Order of the Phoenix"".

The cast is, as always, wonderful.  Brendan Gleeson is outrageous as ""Mad-Eye"" Moody, the newest addition to the Harry Potter film world.  Unfortunately, we don't get to see much of some our favorite characters, such as Snape (Alan Rickman); in fact, these old characters seem to nearly fade away completely.  Which brings me to my one complaint about the film: it seems rushed.  It runs at around 157 minutes, while the book was something near 700 pages.  LOTS was cut for the film, and it seems like it - only what was absolutely necessary was kept.  I would rather have had the filmmakers release a three-hour film that cut so much out, and I know I'm not alone there.

Lastly, I was interested to hear Patrick Doyle's score now that John Williams has departed from the series.  Williams' music had a sense of wonder and magic.  Doyle's music does occasionally feel wonderous, but for the most part, Doyle is a suspense man.  While his score isn't bad, it definitely cannot compare to that of John Williams.

""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is one of the year's best films, and although it does seem rushed, it's 157 minutes of well-made, entirely absorbing entertainment.",1132704000,,1872,4.746130030959752
2506061,3,B000E6EK3S,"i was very excited to see this movie but was disappointed after watching it. it was like just watching a very long trailer. actually, the trailer was better than the film itself. the film lacked character analization on DD. the scenes were badly cut. if you didn't read the book you'll get so lost while watching it. they tried to give the characters some emotion, they tried..but some viewers just can't get it because it lacked some explanations...i hope they will have an extended version dvd... the SFX were very good..., the actors did very well...the young actors could've done better if the overall concept was good...hmm, but bad directing..

suggestions for the next HP films:

1.i think they should make a website or forums and get input from harry potter fans themselves on how it must be done, what to include and what to scrap out before they even start shooting..

2. if it need be 4 or 5 hours, so be it!

3. get 2 directors (an artistic director who can show feelings and a technical one)

4. hold a scriptwriting contest for specific scenes and just incorporate it to overall concept...",1132617600,,1103,4.664948453608248

So much in fact, that their was hardly any dialog, and the most exciting action sequences where barely given a nod. Instead, things were ADDED that did not happen in the book (like an extra hysterical Hermione, and a longer dragon scene, and a cuddling Myrtle). I am also dissapointed with the change in Dumbledore's character. Gone is the stoic, inspiring, funny, and strong professer. Now he is loud, brisk, pushy, and gruff. Not someone to confide in. Moody was well-done, but the house-elves were never brought on the scene, nor was there any explanation for the culprits escape from prison. I suppose that because i have read all the books, i can fill in where the movie left out. But even so, i felt it sorely lacked the feel of the other movies, and did no service to the author.

2506065,5,B000E6EK3S,"Yes, if you haven't read Harry Potter 4, you will probably be confused a lot of the time! But having read the book I appreciated the fast moving pace of the movie. For one thing, this pace allowed the film to include many of the juicy parts of the book without getting bogged down with all the details. These details worked mostly splendidly in the book, but would maybe not have worked so well in a movie. For instance, the dating aspect of the book was enjoyable and not at all oppressive or drawn out-at times, I think it was somewhat overdone in the book. Another example appeared in the chilliness between Ron and Harry. Whereas in the book it seemed to drag on, in the film it was shorter and sweeter.  I also found it a daring and liberating move to take out the part with the Dursleys. Likewise I appreciated the fact that some purely repulsive scenes were not present in the film such as the human torture scene at the Qudditch tournament. To me the overall out come was a tight, smooth flow to the film and a greater concentration on the Goblet of Fire tasks.

Talking about the tasks, the computer graphics brought them to a vibrant life. This is also what they did for the Qudditch tournament at the beginning.

Ron and Harry seemed to be acting better and I think Hermonie (sp) acted somewhat better too. I didn't enjoy Ron as much in the other films as I did in this one.",1132617600,,1385,4.3604651162790695
2506066,4,B000E6EK3S,"In short, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a great book, and I think that the movie version of it is just as great.

Well...maybe.

In GOF, Harry and his friends enter their fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  This year is very special, because Hogwarts will be hosting the Triwizard Tournament,  in which three wizards take part in three dangerous events to win 'eternal glory.'  Two neighboring wizard schools come to Hogwarts to participate, and one student (at least 17 years of age) from each school is chosen to take part.  They throw their name into the Goblet of Fire, which spits out the names of who is to participate.

However, after the three names are chosen, a fourth one is spit out as well.  That student is (you guessed it) Harry Potter, who is underage for the tournament.  But the Goblet chose him, and now he must compete.

But this movie isn't all about the tournament.  There's a dance for the first time at Hogwarts, and we get to see Voldemort change into human form (well, about as human as he can get).

GOF tells the story well.  The special effects are great, it's funny, scary, everything you could want in a movie.

However, there are some downsides to this flick.  The beginning: WAY too short.  I mean, was the Quidditch World Cup even THERE?  It was about 100 pages in the book, but about 5 minutes in the movie. They totally changed that part...whatever happened to Winky?

But after the kids arrive at Hogwarts, things don't feel so rushed.  They kinda do again though in the final duel with Voldemort.  In my opinion, that was another part that really needed to be longer.  Several subplots were also cut out.

Other than that, this movie was very enjoyable.  For a 734 page book, they were able to fit all the important stuff in a 2 hour and 37 minute movie, and did a pretty good job of it.",1132617600,,1858,4.480597014925373
2506067,5,B000E6EK3S,"I must admit, when I saw that yet another new director had been hired, I was wary. But I went and saw GOF opening weekend anyway, and it was without a doubt worth braving the throngs of fellow fans to do it.

What I like about this movie is that the filmmakers seem to finally understand a fundamental fact: The vast majority of people who will watch this already know the plot. They have already perused the book many, many times, and don't need it to be rehashed through mind-numbing exposition scenes. Thus, most of the book's long conversations have been cut out or heavily abridged, allowing the film to jump at a fast clip from big moment to big moment.

And what moments they are. All the events from the book, which we could only see in our minds' eyes and tiny illustrations before, have been brought to life. The Durmstrang ship rises magnificently from the lake; the Hungarian Hortail is incredibly real and frightening; the Goblet of Fire stands taller than most of the characters, spewing flames; and the hedge maze stretches on for what seems like an eternity, bathed in an ominous fog.

Speaking of fog, the entire movie has a ""dark"" look similar to Prisoner of Azkaban. Even Dumbledore's office, once glowing with shades of gold, looks like a completely different place. It is clearly conveyed that this installment of the series is, to quote the tagline, where everything changes.

Finally, the acting is very good throughout the film. The three main stars are getting better, especially Daniel Radcliffe, and the new characters are also well-portrayed. Some characters' roles have been shrunk (Alan Rickman and Tom Felton are barely even there), but they still have some great moments.

Although I can't reccomend this film to those who haven't read the book, as they wouldn't understand it, I hope that every book fan turns out to see it. Sure, there are some inaccuracies (why are Harry and Ron supporting Bulgaria? Where are the monsters in the hedge maze?), but they can be understood and forgiven. Words really cannot describe what a treat this is for Harry Potter lovers.",1132617600,,2095,4.792243767313019
2506068,5,B000E6EK3S,"Harry Potter (Radcliffe) is back for his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizadry, and it is not going to be an easy year.  First off, it is announced that there will be the Tri-Wizard Tournament, in which the three participating schools have a champoin chosen for them from the Goblet of Fire.  Those champions will compete against each other in a series of challenges.  When the names are chosen, not only is each school represented, but the Goblet also chooses a fourth champion: Harry Potter.

Forced to compete in the tournament, Harry soon finds that the tournament is very dangerous, and perhaps someone entered him into it in the hopes that he would be injured or even killed.  If that is not enough, Harry is having dreams of Voldemort (Fiennes).  It seems that the dark lord may be making a comeback, and that does not bode well for anyone.

""Goblet"" is arguably the best of the Harry Potter movies so far.  Filled with action and a key plot point - the return of Voldemort, it does not disappoint.  The kids have come into their own and it is difficult to imagine anyone else filling those roles.  Fiennes is perfect as Voldemort, bringing a creepy evilness that is just right for you know who.  Director Mike Newell has taken the longest of the Harry Potter books, streamlined it, and made an entertaining motion picture.  Only one and a half years to wait for ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"", and summer 2007 cannot come soon enough.",1132617600,,1474,4.626923076923077
2506069,5,B000E6EK3S,"I enjoy this film, because there are lots of fascinating moments like the black lake. There are also special-effects, which look real. There are more characters than the previous three films, like that Fleur Delacour and so on. Ciao!!!",1132531200,,235,5.051282051282051
2506070,4,B000E6EK3S,"""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is the ugly duckling of its pedigreed family, shoddily put together and yet darkly beautiful. In its blunt, rushed, paranoid manner it owes more to a movie like ""War of the Worlds"" than it does the first three ""Potter"" pictures, and what seems like poor action choregraphy and film- chool editing from director Mike Newell is, I think, intended. It is jarring, cold and angry, standing apart in tone and polish.

Since ""The Goblet of Fire"" is the most action-packed of the six J.K. Rowling books - it opens with the World Quiddtich Championship, has the Triwizard tournament as its centerpiece and the return of Voldemort at its close - Newell and screenwriter Steve Kloves made difficult - and mostly correct - choices in paring the book down into a three-hour movie.  The match is cut entirely, while the encounter between Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) and Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is stripped to its essence. The Tournament - featuring two competitors from other schools (Beaubaxtons and Durmstrang), the golden Cedric Diggory from Hogwarts, and Harry as a surprise, unexpected fourth entrant - is fiercely captured from the opening battle against dragons to the giant, murky hedge maze straight out of ""The Shining."" In the maze is the coveted Cup and a trap for Harry, and, unfortunately, Cedric.

These movies generally boil down to their plots, their action scenes, the performances, and the mood.  Newell's movie is much less formal, and, in a sense, less classy than its predecessors. Newell uses more close-ups and edits in a way that processes the action just a shade before the camera captures it or we expect it; it's jittery and indistinct, more dangerous. The skies bloom with depression. A cold North Sea looms behind Hogwarts. The actors have grown more confrontational.

Consider the excellent but cynical performance of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore, the headmaster of Hogwarts, the only man Voldemort fears. Wry, irritable, troubled, his considerable intelligence working over his face, Dumbledore rushes Harry forcefully, demanding answers when Harry's name pops out of the goblet. Such a change from the bemused, befuddled (and dying)Richard Harris of the first two movies. It's a crucial development to the headmaster - whose role grows in the fifth and sixth books - and maybe Newell's best contribution to the series. His eventual death will not only be sad, but a formidable, seismic shift -as if a violent death of Yoda -should this characterization continue.

Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith), mentor Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) and even Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) mostly sit on the sideline of ""Goblet of Fire."" Professor Trelawny (Emma Thompson) isn't around. They're replaced by the trashy Mad Eye Moody (Brendan Gleeson), the new Dark Arts professor with limitless knowledge but questionable methods, a couple bug-eyed Ministry of Magic officials, and, of course, the demented, theatrical Voldemort, deliciously played by Ralph Fiennes. Watch ""M"" and ""Silence of the Lambs"" back-to-back. That's Voldemort.

Newell gets okay work from the three teen leads of Radcliffe, Rupert Grint (as Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (as Hermione Granger) although the improv classes he apparently put them through didn't bear much fruit. Radcliffe simply cannot transmit the right wavelengths of courage and frustration inside Harry; he seems bored and confused in his first showdown with Voldemort. Grint and Watson flirt and spar quite well with each other, but Hermione still acts like Meg Ryan in one of her eye-scrunching, gesticulating fits much of the time.

Screenwriter Kloves leavens ""The Goblet of Fire"" with a little humor between the Tournament's first and second challenges, as Harry and Ron unsuccessfully search for dates to the Triwizard ball. But the laughs are slight and dry. The yippee cartoon times of the Columbus pictures are gone. To borrow a phrase from the ""The Lord of The Rings,"" we're entering Mordor territory in the ""Potter"" series; this gritty ""Goblet of Fire"" is not the wonderous romp of dark and light that ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" was, but then maybe it can't be. ""Dark and difficult times lie ahead,"" Dumbledore intones. The days of comfort have ended.",1132531200,,4266,5.199417758369724

Movie Review - **** (out of *****)

The bells are gone.  So are Harry's Muggle relatives.  In there place is a graveyard, and behind that a dark house where an evil plot is hatching.  This plot will change everything in the wizarding world as Harry knows it.  As the viewer, this dark and shockingly real opening has already done just that.  The death of an unfortunate Muggle at the hands of the sinister Lord Voldemort heralds the arrival of the first great Harry Potter movie.  Although the movie still has its problems, it is undoubtedly one of the best fantasy adventures in recent years-the first Potter movie that can seriously compare with Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy.

Although the story is based around Lord Voldemort's plot to return to power, that isn't really what the movie focuses on.  Instead, it looks at all of its situations and events in terms of how they relate to the themes of the movie:  bravery in the face of unexpected challenges and the loss of innocence.  Rather than simply telling us the story, it tells us primarily why the story is important to the characters.

If you are reading this, you probably already know the plot.  The plot itself is just a tool, though, as is the plot of the entire series.  The real meat of these stories is in following the aging of the lead characters.  In the movies, we also get to experience watching the actors grow up with their characters.  This has especially been the greatest pleasure of Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire, where each of the three leads has made the characters their own.

In this film, Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, and Ron Weasley experience their first-ever headfirst encounters with jealousy (particularly Ron), sexuality, and death.  All three of the leads handle their characters beautifully-the lack of polish in their acting makes their characters and relationships as kids more genuine, in a way.  Radcliffe is on his way to developing a style with subtlety and nuance, Watson is lovingly earnest (not to mention strikingly beautiful), and Grint is developing great comedic timing, even if he does simply pull faces too much.

Powerful scenes are littered throughout the movie.  The most talked-about is the scene where Harry must get a golden egg from the clutches of a dragon.  This scene was extended from the book to include the dragon escaping his chains and chasing Harry around Hogwarts.  The other key scene is the climactic scene, in which Lord Voldemort rises again, ready to finish Harry Potter off once and for all.  This scene is the pivotal moment in the entire Harry Potter series:  it is the closing of the door to everything past, and the opening of the door to a whole new world.

The most powerful moment, however, is not the grand return, nor the thrills of the Triwizard Tournament.  The most powerful moment is after the death, when we hear a sound so unexpected in Harry Potter that it threw even me, one of the readers, off guard:  the uncontrollable wails of a mourning father.  It is in that shocking moment when we realize that it's for real.",1132531200,,3131,4.733826247689464
2506074,2,B000E6EK3S,"I am a big fan of the books and have enjoyed the movies so far without too much complaint. It has made a good deal of sense why minor details were cut out of the movie, but the reason I gave this film such a low review is because how the screenwriters managed to butcher the characters.

1.) Victor Krum is meant to be an awkward guy who is tall, lanky and has a sort of duck-like walk. When you get him on a broom this awkwardness is completely gone. He's also a quiet character who is always found in the library at the same time as Hermione. That's why she's attracted to him in the first place. This is completely changed for the movie. Victor Krum is suddenly a very robust and muscular young man who is adored by the ladies. He is also very cocky and seems to have absolutely nothing in common with Hermione.

2.) Cedric Diggery is also not such a self conceited character. They did manage to cast a good looking young man, but since when does he laugh at Harry? It is also insinuated that it is Cedric's friends who make the ""Potter Stinks"" buttons. That's not true! Cedric is adored by his father, yes, but Cedric is a Prefect. He isn't a popular kid who uses that to his own advantage. Cedric is loved by his classmates because he is a genuinely good person. They didn't do a very good job of portraying this. The audience feels very little for Cedric which doesn't give such a great character any justice.

3.) Since when does Dumbledore try to strangle Harry? I had a lot of problems seeing a character who has always been respectful turn to this sudden loss of hope. Suddenly Dumbledore doesn't know what to do, he can't handle the situation and he continues to yell at the students. Dumbledore is such a respected character that he doesn't have to yell or lose his temper. When he says something, people listen. Harry looks up to Dumbledore as a father figure and a respected mentor that I feel Dumbledore placing his hand around his neck would destroy a lot of that trust. Dumbledore's true character is much like that grandfather you always wished that you had. Someone you'd want to sit with you for hours and tell you all of his stories. The movie version of Dumbledore is so stressed out that he continually loses his senses from scene to scene.

4.) The last challenge in the Tri-Wizard Competition involves a maze. The cool thing about this part in the book is how around each corner there is a different challenge to be faced. You have to answer riddles, face monsters and use your head. The maze in the film keeps changing, so the only real challenge is to see who can keep running. If you can do that, then you'll win in the end. How is that a challenge worthy of the best competitors from each wizard school? I understand that they were pushed for time, but they could at least have tried to do something of importance with the maze.

Overall, I felt bad for people who hadn't read the book and watched this movie. Those viewers were completely lost because there wasn't anytime in the movie for the characters to actually explain what had just happened. There's no explanation as to why the two wands collided like that. That's a major fact that is worth the extra minute. If they would have cut down on the unneeded excessive special effects sequences, there would have been time. I have no interest in watching this movie a second time. I intend on sticking to the books and I highly recommend the same to any loyal fans of the book. Save your money and re-read the book. You'll feel much less frustrated, I promise.",1132531200,,3543,4.436251920122888
2506075,3,B000E6EK3S,"I was very disappointed in the movie.  The only reason I rate it 3 stars instead of 2 is because the people working on special effects did a good job.  The acting was good.  Here's the problem.  When Hollywood gets ahold of a long book a few things can happen and did. Some of the more meaningful, funny, interesting things got cut out of the movie.  Instead they even added an extended action scene during the Tri Wizzard Contest that wasn't in the book in the first place.  It jumped very quickly from one thing to another without the events that would have given a smooth transition.  I feel asleep shortly, thankful for my Senior Citizen discount I didn't have to pay a lot to see this movie. This movie seemed like a standardized Hollywood movie, very disappointing without the subtle things included.  Suggestions, the book is long, why not two movies instead of one or better yet a television series of the whole Harry Potter movies in mini series of one hour a week.  There is enough material to keep going for quite some time.  Also for those of you wanting to take young children there are some gruesome things in the plot which would cause me to think twice before bringing a youngster.  I can't understand how people gave this movie such good reviews.  It put me to sleep literally.  I hope I didn't snore too loud.",1132531200,,1327,4.502092050209205
2506076,5,B000E6EK3S,"As Harry, Hermoine, and Ron all have reached puberty, so too, has their story. This is no longer a story for little children. It is quite possibly not a story for young teens either.

This is a very mature, emotionally well developed story of adolesensce for us all.

Harry is somehow a competitor in the Tri-Wizard Tournament (which is only open for wizards 17 and up). Ron believes Harry cheated in order to get in the competition. Harry has no idea how he made it into the competition. This competition is the storyline for the entire film. However, along the way we meet many very interesting (some of the most interesting thus far) characters we've seen in the entire series. We also realize in this film that these characters are supposed to be real and they deal with the very real, and uncomfortable situation of having to ask (and be asked) dates to a dance.

One of the best aspects of this film is that we also realize that young Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) is becoming quite a good actor. At sixteen, Radcliffe could have just coasted on his previous boyish performance, but he has managed to provide us with some very real, believable emotional range. He should have a career beyond Harry Potter once the series ends.

This is also the darkest and most emotionally draining films in the series. There is a death at the end that will have a profound effect on children and adults alike.

Frankly, I do not think this film is for kids. I think it is quite frightening and the death at the end is going to have them very distraught.

That said, I believe this is the best Harry Potter film of the entire series.",1132531200,,1618,4.523972602739726

It has more emotional power than any of the other films in the series, largely due to the fact that now, we are dealing with teenagers.  The real humor that is part of early adolesence is mined for all of its fail-safe cliches, and it allows us to know each of our heros even better.  There is not one battle, race or challenge that does not look utterly real.  And when Voldemort appears, the movie takes on a shockingly horrific feel - one that had the small children in front of me in absolute terror (they had to be removed from the theatre).  This movie gave me, a middle-aged man, the same visceral thrill I got when watching the first Star Wars in 1977 - that heady, intoxicating mix of fantasy, laughter and real human emotion is so potent I can't wait to see it again.

2506078,5,B000E6EK3S,"The ""Harry Potter"" films keep coming on strong, and ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" is no exception! I've seen this film on the very first day it came out, and I have to agree that THIS was probably the best ""Potter"" film since ""The Chamber of Secrets""! In a way, ""The Goblet of Fire"" was a lot more darker than ""Chamber""! As the first British director that the ""Potter"" series has so far, Mike Newell (""Four Weddings and a Funeral"", ""Mona Lisa Smile"") brought a captivating presence into directing this fourth outing of author J.K. Rowling's ""Potter"" book franchise. Young superstars Daniel Radcliffe (as Harry Potter), Rupert Grint (as Ron Weasley), and Emma Watson (as Hermione Granger) are back and are, once again, stronger than ever! Especially the performance of young Radcliffe, who continues to intrigue me in every scene that he is in! Also back again are Robbie Coltrane (""Nuns on the Run""), Michael Gambon (""Gosford Park""), Jason Isaacs (""Black Hawk Down""), Gary Oldman (""Batman Begins""), Alan Rickman (""Die Hard""), Maggie Smith (""Hook""), and Timothy Spall (""The Last Samurai""); and some new faces are in the film, including Ralph Fiennes (""Schindler's List""), Brendan Gleeson (""Lake Placid""), and Miranda Richardson (""The Phantom of the Opera""), in which they all gave tour de force performances which are sure to be the highlights of their careers!

In a nutshell, difficult times does indeed lie ahead for Harry Potter (Radcliffe). Beset by nightmares that leave his scar hurting more than usual, Harry is all too happy to escape his disturbing dreams by attending the Quidditch World Cup with his friends Ron (Grint) and Hermione (Watson). But something sinister ignites the skies at the Quidditch campsite - the Dark Mark, the sign of the evil Lord Voldemort. It's conjured by his followers, the Death Eaters, who haven't dared to appear in public since Voldemort (Fiennes) was last seen thirteen years ago - the night he murdered Harry's parents.

Harry longs to get back inside the safe walls of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, where Professor Dumbledore (Gambon) can protect him. But things are going to be a little different this year. Dumbledore announces that Hogwarts will host the Triwizard Tournament, one of the most exciting and dangerous of the wizarding community's magical competitions. One champion will be selected from each of the three largest and most prestigious wizarding schools to compete in a series of life-threatening tasks in pursuit of winning the coveted Triwizard Cup. The Hogwarts students watch in awe as the elegant girls of the Beauxbatons Academy and the dark and brooding boys of Durmstrang Institute fill the Great Hall, breathlessly awaiting the selection of their champions.

Ministry of Magic official Barty Crouch (Roger Lloyd Pack) and Professor Dumbledore preside over a candlelit ceremony fraught with anticipation as the enchanted Goblet of Fire selects one student from each school to compete. Amidst a hail of sparks and flames, the cup names Durmstrang's Quidditch superstar Victor Krum (Stanislav Ianevski), followed by Beauxbatons' exquisite Fleur Delacour (Clmence Posy) and finally, Hogwarts' popular all-around golden boy Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson). But then, inexplicably, the Goblet spits out one final name: Harry Potter!! At just 14 years old, Harry is three years too young to enter the grueling competition. He insists that he didn't put his name in the Goblet and that he really doesn't want to compete. But the Goblet's decision is binding, and compete he must. Suspicion and jealousy abound as muckraking journalist Rita Skeeter (Richardson) fans the flames of the Harry Potter backlash with her outrageous gossip columns. Even Ron begins to believe his ""fame seeking"" friend somehow tricked the cup into selecting him. Suspecting that whoever did enter Harry's name in the Triwizard Tournament deliberately wants to put him in grave danger, Dumbledore asks Alastor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody (Gleeson), the eccentric new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor, to keep his highly perceptive and magical eye trained on the teenage wizard.

Harry prepares for the challenging Triwizard tasks - evading a fire-breathing dragon, diving into the depths of a great lake and navigating a maze with a life of its own. But nothing is more daunting than the most terrifying challenge of them all - finding a date for the Yule Ball. For Harry, dealing with dragons, merpeople and grindylows is a walk in the park compared to asking the lovely Cho Chang (Katie Leung) to the Yule Ball. And if Ron weren't so distracted, perhaps he would acknowledge a change in his feelings for Hermione. Events take an ominous turn when someone is murdered on Hogwarts grounds. Scared and still haunted by dreams of Voldemort, Harry turns to Dumbledore. But even the venerable Headmaster admits that there are no longer any easy answers. As Harry and the other champions battle through their last task and the advancing tendrils of the ominous maze, someone or something is keeping a watchful eye. Victory is in sight, but as they edge closer to the Triwizard Cup, all is not as it seems - and Harry soon finds himself hurtling head-first toward an inevitable encounter with true evil...

In a way, the entire ""Harry Potter"" series is about the loss of innocence, and ""The Goblet of Fire"" is no exception. For ""The Goblet of Fire"", EVERYTHING changes. Not only are Harry and his friends now old enough to notice the opposite sex (and they definitely notice), but there are much darker forces at work, as well. There is a conspiracy afoot, and those who might have helped Harry navigate it in the past cannot help him anymore. And in the midst of all the upheaval, someone is going to die. In the first ""Potter"" film, ""The Sorcerer's Stone"", everyone was very wide-eyed, almost nave. And Harry was thinking that just because he was entering a magical world, it's got to be better than the one he's come from. But it's not. Also, where would our hero be if he didn't have something to overcome? And for that matter, where would the series be if there weren't some significant changes in the usual plot pattern: Harry surviving just about everything with the help of his best friends Hermione (with her brains) and Ron (offering moral support)? While the fact remains that the power of friendship is still an underlying theme this time around, however, this will give Harry a rude awakening to another fact: that if he's going to make it in life, he's going to have to do it alone.

In conclusion, every scene in ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" shows that this is definitely not kid stuff anymore, and ""Goblet"" wears its upgrade to a PG-13 rating like a dark badge of honor. Enough said, ""The Goblet of Fire"" has it all, including extraordinary and powerful characters, a top-notch cast, an emotional and humorous storyline, and astounding special effects! ""The Goblet of Fire"" left me with a feeling of going back to watch the first three ""Harry Potter"" films as well. It's a real shame that we have to wait until 2007 for the next film, ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" to come out, but I still can't wait nevertheless! But until then, I will still enjoy the first three films, not to mention ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" when it comes to DVD next year as a must-have to my collection!",1132531200,,7377,4.959579628132579
2506079,1,B000E6EK3S,"I found this much-anticipated movie very disappointing.  I felt that the new director must be addicted to ""action"" movies.  There is a lot of action in HP4; so much that trying to piece the story together is  difficult, even if you know the story.  There isn't much of a story here, just a lot of special effects.  For HP4 purists, you will be disappointed, I think, with the lack of accuracy to the original story. The crucial parts of the story were glossed over so quickly (or missed entirely)you could easily become lost.  I also didn't like the way that Dumbledore was portrayed in HP4.  Dumbledore's character is supposed to be strong but quiet.  This portrayal really missed the mark.  The writers took so many liberties with the book's characters' personalities that I was appalled.  Very disappointing movie.  I agree with the reviewer that Rowland would be upset with this latest attempt to represent her hard work.",1132531200,,925,4.828025477707007
2506080,1,B000E6EK3S,"HP 4 was horrible.
(UPDATE APRIL/2006:  I like it now that I have been watching it DVD a few times. It has grown on me, but it was odd that it was sold to me from Walmart w/ no bonus materials, but just the movie.) End Update

If you are a reader of the books or listen to them on audio cd/cassette, you will know that Hollywood not only cut out vital parts of the book but this time actually changed the story (e.g., Dobby the house elf was eliminated from the story line all together).  Sexual innuendo was present, not by the Rowling, but by Hollywood.

In short, the movie was jumping over chapters of the book too fast and leaving many of the nonreaders in the dark.  I heard many people whispering in the theatre questions as to what is going on in the movie.

They should have just made the movie longer.

HP 3 had a good director, and the story kept to the book more than the first two movies.  This one however, really went a step further by changing the story line and changing some of the characters (Albus is portrayed as losing his temper, but that in the book is never his style).

Poor Dobby, the house elves and the SPEW campaign gets the shaft entirely.

This move was a big disappointment, and Rowling should be angry.
Peter Jackson of Lord of the Rings fame would make the Harry Potter epic a grand movie collection indeed.  One day in the future, Harry Potter will be done over, as most stories do, and maybe then, they will get it right!

2506081,1,B000E6EK3S,"My favorite genre is fantasy & science fiction. While I have never been a big fan of the Harry Potter storyline, I like to keep an open mind. I have to say the cinematography and special effects are absolutely magnificent, and the creatures from ancient mythology are always a treat. There are also moments with a wonderful sense of humor, which is especially appreciated. But, when all is said and done, I found this particular Harry Potter episode alternating too often between boring and disturbing.

First, the disturbing. An amputation, the brutal murder of a young man, an act of torture, and the wailing of a grieving father, in quick succession, was rather demoralizing, to put it mildly. One thing is for sure: This movie is certainly not made with young children in mind.

Was all this intense violence really necessary for what is essentially a movie series for children and teens? In my opinion, it's a sign of poor writing, or worse, pandering to the audience. I can appreciate the need to be edgy and sensational, and the desire to maximize one's profits. But does everything have to be so black and white in the Harry Potter universe? After a while it's starts to become a cliche, and that's boring!

The screen writing had a lot to be desired. The editing was terrible. There was a lot of meaningless or annoying dialog. Some of the acting was very weak and shrill.

With all the money this film rakes in the Director should be getting the best teen actors in the world, even for minor, or cameo roles. I just can't believe how predictable much of the acting is! At times, it's like a broken record! Then on the other hand, you have some top adult talent that barely gets to say a word, like the Maggie Smith character.

I guess I'm expecting way too much from a formula-type film. Something which clearly reflects the dualism in our Judeo-Christian tradition, and our Capitalist system of putting profits first, and everything else, like art, second!",1132531200,,1967,4.7063953488372094
2506082,5,B000E6EK3S,"I have been a fan of the Harry Potter franchise for about 4 years now.  This movie is without a doubt the best one yet!  The movie wasts not time at all jumping right into the story.  It was a concern of mine wondering how they were going to fit 734 pages of rich context into a 157 minute movie.  They managed!

This movie has every important scene that was in the book.  I know there was a scene with the Dursely's which would have been fun to see in screen but not seeing it didn't harm the story at all.

This is however a movie that I think should stick to an audience no younger than 10 years old.  I think the pg-13 rating is a little extreme but I certainly understand why.  There are some scenes in this movie that a youngster might consider disturbing.  A character dies and Harry has to face his arch enemy in person.  The story also deals with teenage dating and innuendo as well as a very wide range of emotions.  I feel that some people under the age of 10 would not pick some of this up.  I say some people heavy because I think kids today are more in tune with whats going on in todays society than they were 20 years ago, or even 10.  With the internet, tv, movies and friends, they are exposed to a lot more these days.

This movie certainly shouldn't be shunned because it is darker.  Anyone who has read the books knows this.  Harry doesn't stay a little 11 year old for 7 years.

I found the book Goblet of Fire entertaing but I found the movie the most entertaining of the series.  Anyone who is a true Potter fan will love this movie, no question!  See this movie!  I would have given it 6 stars if I could have!",1132444800,,1635,4.110759493670886

2506084,4,B000E6EK3S,"Positives:

1) Held True To Story: What was important to the story held true.  My biggest dislike of the third movie was that too much was left out, especially a lot of the important, significant stuff.  While a lot was left of this movie (it had to be) they didn't leave anything of GREAT importance out of the movie.

2) Special Effect: The special effects were pretty good.  Whether Harry was flying through the air, swimming under water, or doing battle with the Dark Lord there appeared to be no expense spared in making it look good and realistic.

3) Sound Track: The music to this Harry Potter was very good.  I'd even say a bit better than previous Harry Potter movies.

4) Acting: For having to direct a ton of children, this movie had some excellent acting.  There is one exception, outlined in the negatives, but the acting was great no matter if it be a child or an adult.

5) More Intense: The book was more intense and the movie held true to this as well.  Thus the PG-13 rating.  The book, nor this movie, is not for the weak hearted.

6) Humor: A bit of humor was added to this movie.  It didn't put the actors our of character but it did make things a lot more funny and interesting.

Negatives:

1) Emma Watson's Acting:  Emma did AWESOME in the first three movies but in the fourth movie it seems she has picked up acting lessons from William Shatner.  Every line she uttered was overly emotional and exaggerated.  This was not the Emma nor the Hermoine was have all come to love!  I hope she does better in the fifth movie.  Thank goodness the topic of S.P.E.W. was left out of this movie, I probably would have walked out!!

2) No Quidditch World Cup: We got to the world cup but didn't see it take place.  Just the opening of it.  Too bad, I was really expecting to see a treat.  Instead, it just skipped to everybody celebrating the outcome.  This was a missed opportunity to see some awesome special effects and creative choreography.

3) Bad Pacing of Movie:  This was especially true at the beginning.  It changed from fast to slow to fast to slow within a few minutes.  It did a horrible job of building up to action and did a worst job of cooling off of it.  It made things feel fairly uncomfortable. The pace got better by the end of the movie, but the first half an hour was just plain dizzying.

4) Rita Skeeter stuff:  Of all the stuff they could have left out, I'm surprised this didn't make the cut.  Her appearance added nothing to the story and it left out the things that made Rita especially horrible.  And the fact that her secret at the end of hte movie was left out completely.... I don't understand why she was in the movie at all.

Overall, highly suggested to anybody who loves reading the books.  Some things may be confusing to those who don't, but they will probably still enjoy the movie if they enjoyed the previous three.",1132444800,,2872,4.381404174573055
2506085,5,B000E6EK3S,"I came into the film expecting a spectacular,atmospheric,scenic adventure. What I got,is what I expected. I thought the movie was too funny(I hate comedies)but overall,for a PG-13 film,it delivers the goods. Fans of the Book may not be as forgiving as the people who hadn't read the films. I agree,most of the movie is abridged,but most of the smaller details that are left out are unimportant in my opinion and are very minor. I've read the book,and I'm justifying that the movie is what it is because of time constraints. Some people wanted it 3 hours,some wanted 4,but the book fans are forgetting the movie fans,and that is something I want to touch on. Its a film,not a book,things are going to be shorter. The casual fan isn't going to stay for a 4 hour film,and those of you who don't care,should,because its the success of the films that keeps the films going. The Book as well. The Hardcore Potter Fan will be disappointed,but like I said,its going to happen. I think they should've made it 3 hours at least,just to fill plot gaps and holes,and include some minor important details. But Overall,I will be seeing this 3 more times,because its the fourth movie.",1132444800,,1168,4.730392156862745
2506086,5,B000E6EK3S,"I just came home from the theatre after seeing ""The Goblet of Fire"" and wow! This movie is absolutely extraordinary. This actually surpasses the previous three HP films and yet has a far different feel altogether. Overall, the movie is a lot darker than even ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" and is far more intense than the former as well. This in fact makes them look daytime in nature in comparison to this. Yet this movie leaves me wanting more out of it, but I'll get to that later on in this review. Some book spoilers might be present in this review but I'll try ti minimize them as much as possible.

 Harry Potter returns to Hogwarts for his fourth year as student of Gryffindor. Hogwarts is selected to host a major wizarding tournament called the Tri-Wizard Tournament with players from three magic schools: Durmstrang, Beauxbaton from France, and last but not least Hogwarts. Yet Harry himself has been plagued by nightmares in recent times of two men plotting murders and they've only gotten worse and more vivid as time wears on. To the surprise (and dismay/concern) to some, Harry Potter despite being only 14 years old, is selected to compete in three dangerous tasks and compete in the Tri-Wizard Tournament yet a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher has triggered suspicion in him and his friends as the threat of Voldemort returning is ever looming. The tournament will certainly be his most daunting adventure yet combined with facing against a revived Lord Voldemort as well. Whatever the outcome, these things combined will put Harry to the ultimate test as the Dark Mark Appears above the stadium.

 The movie is unique among the four since it is the first movie to actually involve Voldemort himself against versus his `memory' form Tom Riddle from ""Chamber of Secrets"" and Ralph Fiennes was the PERFECT actor to actually play the full-fledged revived Lord Voldemort! Whoa, he's scary!

 As great as ""Goblet of Fire"" is, it did leave a lot to be desired though. The film version leaves a great deal of plot elements out of the entire film that made the book version so great to read. A notable one is the House-Elves organization founded by Hermione Granger called Society for the Protection of Elvish Welfare (S.P.E.W.). Even though it's only about 2  hours long, it still leaves one kind of let down with all the things left out. Still overall, this is a great movie and is highly recommended and I can't wait for ""Order of The Phoenix"" to come to the big screen within a few years.",1132444800,,2502,4.7379310344827585
2506087,3,B000E6EK3S,"I am normaly a fan of Harry Potter but when I went to see the Goblet Of Fire, it was ok. I thought the set wasn't good. Neither was the director. The filmmaker rushed the beginning and the three task. The Quittich World Cup which is in the book wasn't shown. They also only showed harry in most of the tasks.

The only one they showed everybody was the Great Lake task. I was mostly just not happy. It should of been longer with a new set, director,and a intermission so the movie makes more sense. I don't care if it is 4hrs long, just make a better movie.",1132444800,,557,4.110091743119266
2506088,5,B000E6EK3S,"I kept an open mind while entering this movie, already knowing some of the things that have been cut from the book.  With this in mind, the movie was very enjoyable and I really enjoyed it.  While the beginning is a bit rushed, once the tasks of the Triwizard Tournament began, the movie flows nicely.  The first task with the dragon is better than the scene in the book.  When Cedric and Harry enter the maze during the third task, it is like you are there with them.  The graveyard scene (the one I was looking forward to the most) is as good as it is in the book if not better (I almost cried when Harry's parents appeared although they were only on screen for like ten seconds).  A very good movie and I can't wait till the next one is released.",1132444800,,749,4.2027972027972025
2506099,5,B000E6EK3S,"This movie should be well-received by those who liked the first 3. The younger actors turned in great performances, especially Daniel Radcliffe who I think has improved greatly over the last several films in his role as Harry. Michael Gambon also seems more comfortable in his second film as Dumbledore and plays it more naturally. Brandan Gleeson absolutely shines as the ""fake"" mad-eye moody and is cast very well, even though I imagined moody as older and thinner. I especially enjoyed seeing more of Warwick Davis as Prof. Flitwick, usually in a comic relief role. But what do you expect if you're 3'6"" - besides I'm sure it beats playing an Ewok.

Need I mention that Ralph Fiennes is incredible as the Dark Lord? Great makeup job also - he's menacing and evil but not overdone.

Most of the casting is very well done and the screenplay although extremely stripped down conveys the theme and storyline well. The source material, J. K. Rowling's fourth book in the series, is over 700 pages and originally there were proposals to create 2 films to do it more justice. The decision to only make one film necessitated quite a bit of cutting and it may help viewers who have read the book to know this going in so they are not too disappointed. So there is no Winky, no Dobby, no S.P.E.W or Hermione protesting house-elf treatment. We don't see Mrs. Weasley, Percy, Bagman, Bertha Jorkins or the giant spider in the third task. Rita Skeeter shows up twice, Sirius only shows up in the fire. Entire sub-plots have to be scrapped.

But even so the film triumphed because it is basically plays well as an action flick. The 3 tasks come alive through spectacular special effects and CGI backdrops of gothic proportions. The mermaids and dragons were the perfect blend of fantasy and realism with enough of the lastter to interact seamlessly with the actors. The dramatic scenes are placed perfectly to give the movie a great sense of pacing and as I mentioned earlier, the kids do great. I especially liked the exchanges between Watson and Grint as Hermione an Ron during the yule ball.

My minor gripes are just that - minor - and didn't do much to my enjoyment. Cho Chang is supposed to be a year older than Harry, but she looks several years younger. I wanted to see more of Gary Oldman as black. Also - who is Nigel? Why did the movie makers create a character when Rowling has dozens that don't make it into the film.

As a father I recommend keeping children under 13 away from this movie. I realize that this is a tall order; no doubt there are many younger devotees of the books who would love to see the film. But the images in the film are incredibly dark. Even if a parent was to give in to a younger child, in no wise would I advise allowing kids who have not read the fourth book to see the movie. So it would be best to keep any younger siblings at home. Remember - a student is murdered as well as the old man at the beginning and there are many other intensely scary images. Some kids I know would have nightmares for weeks after seeing something like this.",1132444800,,3070,4.494623655913978
2506100,4,B000E6EK3S,"Although the film seemed initially extremely streamlined of character interaction and reduced to an empty plot for the first half hour, HP IV still managed to capture much of the magic of Rowling's penned world.

Though this monstrous volume of Rowlings was impossible to film in its entirety, I still missed the Dursleys, the Quidditch World Cup, Sirius Black, Hedwig, and much of the humor subtly woven into the plot by Rowling - replaced by slapstick comedy and snide remarks of the Weasley twins (who, like all the actors, seriously needed a haircut!). Surely the Dursley's fireplace ""attack"" of the Weasley's and Ton-Tongue Toffee could have remained?

The tweaking of the main plot and exposure to the villian side-kick B. Crouch Jr was well done and helped the film remain coherent to those who haven't yet discovered the literary world of Harry Potter. The many strands of subplots though, were either dismissed completely (Dobby, Winky, and the House-Elf Liberation Front? Hogsmeade? Weasley's joke shop plans? Divination/Herbology/Transfiguration/Hist of Magic courses?) or barely mentioned (Rita Skeeter's outing Hagrid's Giant history? Being discovered as an unregistered Animagus beetle by Hermione?)

All the complaints aside - HP4 was inifinitely better than HP3 with its display of the events which either were deleted completely, or left in sequence - not translocated to a different part of the movie (as in HP3). The characters were TERRIFIC. Even the smallest acting part returned as a consistent face in the Hogwarts cast, preserving the world of Harry Potter. All actors - even just the kids - did a superb job in this film. The effects and staging - well done.

The graveyard scene - masterfully done. From imagination to creation on screen.

All in all - a job well done for HP4. A nice recovery from the HP3 - a movie with a solid cast and good baseline plot ruined by poor directing and pitiful execution. This Muggle and Harry Potter fan was satisfied immensely by HP4 and I can only look forward to HP5.

I recommend this film to anyone who has read the books. May not be suitable for young children - not so much for creature violence or scary scenes, but for the fact that they just can't manage all of the plot and depth of this storyline.",1132444800,,2270,4.9138381201044385

I am however disappointed with some of the omitions each new movie seems to be making at an increased amount. I for one would be willing to sit through a Harry Potter movie for 3 1/2 hours to 4 hours, just to see these omitions. Maybe they should think of releasing the current chopped version for people who can't stand to watch more than 2 to 2 1/2 hours, and an extended version for die hard fans such as myself. I really missed the Dursley's, the fireplace, the world tournament quidditch match, Dobby the elf,and Surius Black was almost completely left out. The comflict between Harry and Ron was really shortened. They also didn't show Barty Crouch and his relationship to his son. His son, possing as Mad Eye Moody, kills his father and this is ommitted. The list goes on, too numerous for this short space. What they included I loved, the action, the beautiful photography, magical, the mood very good. In short make a longer version , my son agrees, for people that love Harry Potter as we do. I easily set through all the extended versions of Lord of the Rings.

2506103,5,B000E6EK3S,"Books 1 and 2 of the Harry Potter series were quick reads, and were likely aimed at a younger audience. Rowling knows she has some appeal to adults as well as kids, and I think she expects the kids who read books 1 and 2 to have aged and matured as much as Harry has by the time they read of his later adventures. One would hope that as they get mature, and are able to read longer and longer books, as these are becoming, they would also understand that it gets harder and harder for the films, which don't have the luxury of time, to contain it all.

Unlike the first two films, which tried to cram everything in, the third and fourth films don't even try. Screenwriter Kloves and directors Cuaron and Newell quickly identified the spine of the story, and discarded anything that didn't relate to it. Those who are attached to every detail of the books see these deletions or changes as ""mistakes."" Those who understand the process of adaptation know that this is a necessary step in making the story sustain itself on film, independent of the books.

The biggest cuts in these later films comes from classtime. But honestly, those of us who have seen the first two films know how it goes. We've seen McGonogall teach transfiguration and we've seen Snape teach potions. Rather than repeat that in every film, class time is reduced to introducing new faculty members: Hagrid in his first year as a teacher, and of course, whoever happens this year to be filling the lame duck position of Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher. In the last film, that was David Thewlis as Lupin. In this one, it's Brendan Gleason as ""Mad-Eye"" Moody.

As the first book in the series to break the 700 page mark, there were a lot of subplots in the book that had to go for the film. And I do mean HAD to go. The House-Elves are an interesting sup-plot for the book, but the movie doesn't need them, or have the time to devote to them. Hence, rather than having the Dark Mark pinned on Winky, we actually see Barty Crouch Jr do it. We actually see more of him in the film than in the book, giving the audience a sense of dramatic irony, and a chance to put the plot together before the other characters do. Rather than have Dobby give Harry the gillyweed for the second task, Neville does--and given his affinity for herbology, it fits. The Elf Liberation Front and Society for the Promotion of Elvish Welfare are gone. What's left is a lean and mean adaptation of the scenes that are really important. We also see Harry and his friends maturing even more in this film than the last one, with a climax that will rip your heart out and prepare the audience for more heartbreak to come. As the films grow darker, and base themselves on longer and longer books, the filmmakers are finally understanding that their job is to adapt the books, not reproduce them. Rowling understands this, and hopefully fans of the books will too.",1132444800,,2905,4.477358490566037
2506104,5,B000E6EK3S,"For the current installment to the Harry Potter series, Harry and his fellow Hogwart students encounter the challenge to defeat the dark side.  The story and the film content include all the fixings of gallant tales of the past:  romance, battle, and triumph.  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire includes an international flair that involves teams from Europe, which may be the United Kingdom, France, and Russia as well as the characters within the film.  There are high points and low points in the film, which involve the test of friendship and the encounter with death.

The plot begins as Harry and his friends take a trek to the Quidditch World Cup.  Violence ensues after the game.  The Goblet of Fire proceeds with a fantasy and heroic tone.  Yes, there are similarities to the landscape and setting that looks like something out of Star Wars or Lord of the Rings -- the premise of the battle to defeat evil.  In this case, the movie is twofold.  The first half of the film begins like a mystery that evolves from the Quidditch World Cup, Harry's nightmare, and how Harry's name got into the goblet of fire.  In between scenes, little bit of romance, comedy, and puberty run amok, which shows that Harry and his friends are not children anymore.  The second part of the film involves Harry's encounter with death, which ties in with Harry's nightmare, and the evil Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), who closely resembles Nosferatu, or for Fiennes fans, the English Patient.

The cinematography is exceptional.  Director Mike Newell shows the extreme dark side quite well, and the pyrotechnics and the technotronic displays enhance the explosive scenes as well as bring the non-human characters of the book alive.  The triathlon scenes are a sight to see especially when Harry battles a dragon or zig-zags through a maze.  The movie soundtrack provides the powerful accompaniment to the film's setting.

The Goblet of Fire is a film to be seen.  However, the Harry Potter move from PG to  PG-13 rating is well deserved because there are more violent content in Goblet than in previous Potter installments.  Younger children may have nightmares.  Nonetheless, the film provides a fast pace adventure for fantasy moviegoers, those curious of the J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, and Potter fans the progression of their favorite wizard from child to adult.",1132444800,,2359,4.936548223350254
2506105,5,B000E6EK3S,"The Harry Potter film franchise is achieving something that most movie franchises can't----constant improvement.  A recent example would be ""Lord of the Rings"" and, now J. K. Rowling's beloved novels turned films becoming examples as to how well done movie sequels should be.  With ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"", we are taken again to Hogwarts to revisit another year of adventure and danger with the heroic trio of Harry, Ron and Hermione.  Year 4 really begins to show the fans a new danger for the trio---romance!

  With ""Goblet of Fire"", we are treated to many things, such as a glimpse of the Quidditch World Cup and a very dangerous competion at Hogwarts called the Triwizard Competition.  The addition of this event to the school year at Hogwarts, brings students from two other great Wizardry schools, Durmstrang (which boasts the famous Quidditch player, Victor Krum) and Beauxbatons of France, with its giantess headmistress, Madame Maxine.  Both schools arrive at Hogwarts in grandiose fashion and cause a great stir of excitement for all the young witches and wizards.  Also, Voldermort's loyal followers, the Death Eaters make their first appearance in this film series.

  Harry, of course, has many things on his mind, including a disturbing dream involving Wormtail, Voldermort and another man he is unfamiliar with.  On top of this, he is dealing with her first crush, Cho Chang.  And to further complicate his year, his name is spat out of the blue flames of the goblet of fire, even though he is not of age to compete.

  The story then focuses on the Triwizard competion, the blossoming romance of the students and the inevitable return of Lord Voldermort.  The director, Mike Newell, left out several things from the books in order to keep the film under three hours (one of my favorite bits he left out was Hermione's campaign to free the house elves) but kept all that was necessary.

The three principal actors Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson continue to improve their acting skills and are a necessary component for this franchise's continued success. Emma Watson looks so elegant and charming at the ball, it would be not surprise to imagine a huge movie career for her after the Potter series is finished!

  New cast additions of note are:

  Miranda Richardson's Rita Skeeter is very well done.  She captures the nosey and gossipy nature of a tabloid reporter completely.

  Ralph Fiennes is perfect as the sinister and thoroughly evil Lord Voldermort.  I think he is a great choice for this important character in the series.

  David Tennet does a really good job of creating the creepy Barty Crouch Jr.

  Brendan Gleeson brings to life the interesting Mad Eye Moody, complete with in-class instruction of the three unforgivable curses.

  When I first heard that different directors would be making each of the books into films, I was disappointed.  I was afraid that the films would not flow together with varied directors but so far those fears have been put to rest.  Each director seems to take the themes of the book and give the fans an accurate and loving visual of Rowling's novels. The only downside to this film is that I am now longing to see Year 5:  Order of the Phoenix....but I'll just have to wait a while to see that!  Highly recommended to fans and non-fans alike!  Well worth your money!!!",1132444800,,3365,4.858906525573192
2506106,5,B000E6EK3S,"When reading Harry Potter reviews I always wonder, ""Is this person a kid or an adult who probably doesn't know what they're talking about.""  One cannot go by expression and spelling, as these days 12-year olds write like Yale graduates and many people over 30 cannot spell nor can you always tell what they are talking about (possibly because of so much complex baggage).  However, there are some exceptions to the older generation, which validates their opinions for all seasons.  You just take your chances with whom to believe.

I am almost 52 and a child of the 60s.  I, by-and-large, have refused to accept my generation except rock stars and models, and sometimes claim to be 12-years old (for kicks).  Moreover, I think I look swell in D&G, cK, PRADA, Polo, and Gucci.  Just to let you know.

Conventional opinion states that each Potter movie is better than the last.  Logic proves this since from the beginning we knew we would get seven books and seven movies.  Therefore, the last would have to be based on empirical vision from the first.  Using hindsight to move forward almost guarantees improvement.

Moreover, I think the concept of changing directors often is brilliant.  It gives a certain unpredictable element to the films, such that you never know what is really going to happen until after the movie ends, and each director has a distinctive eye to detail that differs from the others and tends to complement the overall sense of magic as each director ""feels"" different.  For example, a simple analogy is the changing staircase in the castle.  Changing directors gives that same impression and sense of excitement.  I have never read a Potter book, but I own all the movies and will own all the movies.  Book fans may rightly feel frustration, disappointment, and even anger, but Goblet is still a damn fine entertaining movie.  Maybe, everyone should view this experience as either the book version or the movie version and TRY to keep them separate.  Fiction writing, screenwriting, cinematography, whatever, it's all about being creative.  Don't always expect creative people to do exactly what you want them to.  They may quite possibly create sometime new???  I saw the IMAX version, and that must have added at least 10% dimension to the total experience.  It was all so CHARMING.

You hear talk of the ""darker"" Potter movies.  And you wonder, ""Are they talking about more blacks and blues in the cinematography, or do they mean to say that it will be more wicked.""  Since The Prisoner of Azkaban, Potter movies are increasingly more wicked.  YES!  This is what we want, especially with everyone looking several-years older in Goblet.  Any kid who can read the books is mature enough for these dark films.  And we are approaching the series climax . . . .  Just how dark do we want it all to end?  We are talking about a school for wizards, not a monastery.

My favorite parts: the group flight to Hogwarts; Harry, the golden egg, and the Dragon; the underwater struggle; the labyrinth up to Lord Voldemort.

I realize that the Potter series is truly magical, and just for the sake alone of all the stunning sights and sounds, the series has justified its existence and reputation.  At one point during Goblet, it became clear that this is SUPPOSED to be a kid's movie, not an adult's movie.  If you can get past that fact, then enjoy the best Potter movie yet.",1132358400,,3390,4.7646048109965635
2506107,5,B000E6EK3S,"Having stood in line in the cold for four hours to buy tickets for the first showing and the one after that on opening day, I must say that the ordeal was worth it.  Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire improves on the other three movies, provides ample character development, where attractions to the opposite gender arise among the 14-year olds, and having the darkest atmosphere of any of the previous outings.

A trip to the World Quidditch Cup of Ireland versus Bulgaria ends in chaos when some of Voldemort's supporters known as Death Eaters, stampede the place.  Also, someone conjures up the Dark Mark, a skull with a snake for a tongue, in the sky.  This someone is trying to get Harry Potter, but who is he?

The Tri-Wizard Tournament, where students from three schools of magic, Hogwarts in England, Beauxbatons in France, and Durmstrang in Bulgaria, compete against each other performing three tasks of no mean feat.  The competitors must be seniors given the dangerousness of each task.  The three champions are selected via parchments submitted in the titular Goblet of Fire, but imagine the surprise of everyone when the Goblet spits out a fourth parchment.  The name on it:  Harry Potter!  It causes puzzlement and contempt among many of his classmates, as they figure he cheated.  Even Ron, who feels betrayed that he never told him, but Harry is unable to convince Ron that he had nothing to do with it, and the two are barely on speaking terms until the end of the first task..

Hermione gets to shine at the Yule Ball, a dancing event that's part of Triwizard, and is splendid in her ballgown, but gets criticized by Ron for choosing the stolid Viktor Krum, Durmstrang's champion and a star Quidditch player whom Moody describes as having sawdust for brains.  And clumsy Neville Longbottom gets to have some glorious bits at the ball.  Harry too has met a pretty face, Cho Chang, who unfortunately is the girlfriend of handsome Cedric Diggory, the Hogwarts competitor in Triwizard.

There's a new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, Alastor ""Mad Eye"" Moody, a fierce no-nonsense ex-Auror (Dark Wizard hunter) with a fake eye that rolls around in its socket and a flask he takes frequent drinks out of.  He believes students should have practical knowledge of the dark arts, especially the three Unforgivable curses, which he demonstrates on a spider.  However, he does have a twisted laugh when demonstrating curses, something he never does in the book, but he is wonderfully played by Brendan Gleeson.

The three tasks involve dragons, merpeople, and a labyrinth of hedges, and it's the first that's the most impressive, as a particularly nasty Hungarian Horntail makes life hell for Harry, armed only with his trusty wand and Firebolt broomstick.

Director Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Mona Lisa Smile) has done an admirably job on Goblet of Fire, but the overall dark interior and exterior atmosphere-especially in the dark and foggy labyrinth, makes the third movie look like a summer picnic.

And the actors are impressive as always, wearing their roles as snugly as an Invisibility cape.  However, Michael Gambon's Dumbledore is more intense and angry than that of the late Richard Harris.

There are some funny moments mixed in with the darkness, as when the bespectacled nerdy and cackling Moaning Myrtle, who resides in the baths, snuggles up to an embarrassed Harry who's trying to figure out the clue for the second task.  But the scene of Harry's nemesis Draco Malfoy turned into a bouncing ferret by Moody is one to be cherished.

Those familiar with the book will not be surprised at the darkness of the movie, and with the tragic outcome that emerges, but will also noticed several subplots from the 734 page book omitted, such as the Dursleys segment where Fred and George play a prank on Dudley, where his tongue grows four foot long, and the concept of SPEW (Society for the Protection of Elf Welfare), where Hermione goes on a cause to improve the living conditions for the house elves.  Hence no Dobby or Winky.  However, the World Quidditch Cup match could've gone on for ten minutes longer-we don't get to see the actual tournament.  The players fly out, we see the mascots, and then cut back to the campgrounds.  Other differences:  in the book, Moody has a wooden leg, where in the movie it's metal, and his nose is partially gone.  In the movie, it's all there.  And though Rita Skeeter, the obnoxious tabloid reporter for the Daily Prophet appears, played wickedly by Miranda Richardson, there's something else about her in the book not done in the movie.

Yes, at 2 hrs 37 minutes, it could've been three hours long, as much of it seems rushed towards the end, but it was well worth the wait--and an Imperius curse to those who think otherwise!",1132358400,,4806,4.816077953714982

The lucky cast of the HP series are steadily improving in their craft i.e. the acting isn't so painful to watch.  There was a lot left out in the film, but I didn't miss it either.  It's a rather long movie, but it went by fast for me.  I love the dark Hogwarts and the over all feel of the movie.  True HP fans will not be disappointed in this film.

2506109,5,B000E6EK3S,"Wait no longer,Year four in the Harry Potter film series is finally here and let me just say,see this while you have a chance!

Harry(Daniel Radcliffe),Ron(Rupert Grint),and Hermionie(Emma Watson)are back for their fourth year at Hogwarts,where new challenges await our heroes:Harry has been entered by someone in the Goblet of Fire(the cup that selects champions to partcipate in the Tri-Wizard Tournament)to particpate in the Tournament,which doesn't make any sense,due to the fact participants must be 17 years old and Harry is only 14. Meanwhile,two supporters of Voldermort are attempting to revive the dark lord so he make continue where he left off 13 years earlier,putting Harry in more danger than ever before. And on top of that,Harry and Ron can't find dates to the annunal Hogwarts dance,The Yule Ball and Hermionie has already been asked. Why can't Harry ever have a normal year at Hogwarts.

The acting is absolutley brilliant. Daniel,Rupert,and Emma continue to shine in their roles,always improving on the previous performance,and it is no exception this time. Robbie Coltrane(Hagrid),Maggie Smith(McGonagall),Alan Rickman(Snape),and all the returning cast members continue to be impressive. Especially Michael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore,whose performance is a huge improvement over his Prisoner of Azakaban's performance.

New cast members include Brendan Gleeson as Alastor ""Mad-Eye Moddy(who is terrific),Robert Pattinson as Cedric,a participant in the Tri-Wizard Tournament and gives a great performance and Katie Leung as Harry's new love interest,Cho Chang(terrific as well)

But anyone who knows the story of the Goblet of Fire knows that the Dark Lord himself,Voldermort,returns. And does he ever! He is played to perfection by Ralph Fiennes. He makes a huge impression on you even though he doesn't even appear till the end. It is a incredible performance that should convince fans and make them look forward to what Ralph does next.

As always,the visual effects are terrific. While in the first film they were only so-so,since then,the effects have improved. Dragons. Mermaids. The Maze. Flying Horses. All this and more and it all looks incredible. The score is good as well. I was disappointed when I heard John Williams wasn't coming back,but Patrick Doyle was a good replacement. I can't compliment him enough.

Mike Newell takes over as director and while he isn't as good as Alfonso Cuaron(""Azakaban"" director),he still does a good job. His work is very impressive and hopefully it impresses you.

While there is so much to compliment,there are a couple of problems:First,it is a tad too long. While it was necessary for following the book,children might be antsy. Second,there are some weird moments,but only because I didn't read the book. People who read the book will understand them,so it's only a small problem. Third,it's PG-13,which means there is more language(unfortunely)and darker moments than the first four. And finally,I asked my brother-in-law,who is a big Harry Potter fan,and he said it didn't follow the book that well. It was disappointing to hear,because I thought it was going to be the most accurate so far. But none of these problems ruined my enjoyment of the movie,and I hope they don't ruin yours ,either.

Well,that's all I have to say. Check out Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire while you still have the chance.",1132358400,,3376,5.308988764044944
2506110,4,B000E6EK3S,"I was fortunate enough to catch a midnight showing of the latest installment in the Harry Potter series, and I must say it does not disappoint. Harry Potter has matured a great deal, along with his best friends, Hermione and Ron, who all share a great deal of emotional turmoil related to romance, friendship and death.

They have quite a bit of obstacles thrown at them, everything from magic to the green demon of jealousy, not to mention the overwhelming forces of Voldemort. Perhaps the most intriguing part of the film is the character development that is brought forth through the testing of the trio's friendship as their platonic feelings grow beyond into something more passionate and dangerous.

The Quidditch World Cup is wonderful, however brief it is, and as usual Potter's involvement in it is nothing short of extraordinary, especially his encounter with a scaly and ferocious creature. This time however, the game goes beyond the traditional matches, and actually becomes a matter of life and death, which takes the film down a much deeper and darker path than ever seen before.

By no means is this film for children any longer, as it has ventured into the territory of content for adolescents and adults. That's a good thing though, because the natural progression of their age and maturity is matched by that of the wickedness of the world that these characters inhabit, and as a result the character development is all the more significant. Their lives are no longer as innocent as they once were, and the dark forces in the world of Harry Potter take a more proactive approach in their power struggle, something which has far more dire consequences than that of the first three films.

Several new characters are introduced who add a great deal of substance to the plot, and as a result the previously existing relationships are permanently altered, becoming more complex than that of childish innocence. Potter's new mentor for example sort of leads Potter down a nefarious path, which is the only way Potter has a chance to stand up to the more imminent confrontation of his greatest foe. His inner demons grow in numbers, and it's obvious that Potter is no longer as benevolent as he once was.

The special effects and setting never disappoint, which complement the film just as effortlessly as before. I must give credit to the new director Mike Newell who has a deep understanding of the more disturbing and adult nature of this 4th chapter in the series.

I wouldn't say that this movie is better than the others, but it's definitely a worthy successor and moves the plot along as well as one could expect. I definitely recommend this film to Potter fans and newcomers alike because it is completely entertaining from start to finish.",1132358400,,2761,4.851380042462845
2506111,4,B000E6EK3S,"First of all, I'll start by saying that I am an avid Harry Potter fan who has read all of the books (more than once) and owns all of the movies.  So of course, you could imagine how excited I was about seeing Goblet of Fire.  To date, this is my favorite book in the series, and while I was a little nervous about how they were going to adapt a 700+ page book into a 2 1/2 hour movie, I thought they did a great job with what they had to work with.

I'll start with the basic plot of the movie.  Harry begins his fourth year at Hogwarts, where it is announced that the school will host the Triwizard Tournament, an international competition pitting one wizard or witch from rival schools against one another; the winner receiving the coveted Triwizard Cup.  To enter, one must put their name in the Goblet of Fire.  Harry, however, is too young to enter the competition (which doesn't bother him at all).  The champions selected are Viktor Krum from Durmstrang, Fleur Delacour from Beauxbatons, and Cedric Diggory from Hogwarts.  However, the goblet spits out a fourth champion...Harry Potter.  Being that putting your name in the goblet is a binding contract, Harry must compete, despite being too young and saying that he did not enter on his own accord.  With the help of his frineds, Harry must face three dangerous tasks, with the final one sending him to a graveyard he has been having nightmares about.  This is the site of the rebirth of Lord Voldemort, and Harry must face his arch nemesis face-to-face.

Here are what I feel the positve aspects of the movie:

~Acting:  Year after year, I am amazed at what changes occur in Dan Radcliffe (Harry), Rupert Grint (Ron), and Emma Watson (Hermione).  First of all, Dan's improvement was evident in Prisoner of Azkaban, but there was still room for more (one particular scene was the Hogsmeade visit where he is ""crying"" and screams ""He was their friend!""  Definitely could've been portrayed better).  For this movie, Dan is really starting to show everyone why he was chosen for the role of Harry Potter.  He was put through a LOT of physical challenges throughout this movie, and he came through them with finesse.  Not only that, he conveys emotions so much better now.  You could actually see tears in his eyes this time around.  I thought his best scene was the graveyard scene...even though I knew what was going to happen, he had me on the edge of my seat!  He did an excellent job, and I am very much looking forward to seeing him portray the ""angry"" Harry in Order of the Phoenix.  As for Rupert and Emma, they also shine in this movie.  During Ron and Harry's falling out, Rupert beautifully acts as the jealous friend, and he had me feeling so incredibly sorry for him.  Emma's best scene was the Yule Ball.  Her fight with Ron was just priceless.

For me, the star actor was Brendan Glesson, who portrays the new DADA teacher, Alastor ""Mad-Eye"" Moody.  He was pure perfection from start to finish.

~Mood:  As the first Harry Potter movie to reach PG-13, this movie was definitely going to be darker than the previous three.  However, it was definitely not dark the whole way through.  There were some hilarious and light-hearted moments.  In addition, the light-hearted and the dark moments were captured during the right scenes, so that it didn't feel too cutesy when Harry was in danger, nor did it feel daunting when Harry was asking Cho to the ball.

~Condensing book to movie:  The screenplay writers had a daunting task of picking out bits and pieces of a massive book in order to make a somewhat comprehensible movie, and even though some important things were left out (which I will discuss later), they did a very good job of cutting the right material.

~Special effects:  I can't remember the exact figure, but this movie was one of the most expensive movies ever made, and the speical effects do not disappoint.  The dragon is phenomenal, and changing the good-looking Ralph Fiennes into the hideous Lord Voldemort was incredible.  Not only that, Mad-Eye Moody with his special ""eye"" and battle scars made him seem very true to the book.

Unfortunately, there are some negative sides to the movie.

~Flow:  I thought the third film was fast-paced and choppy, but this movie is even more so!  The first 15 minutes of the film are so compacted that you feel somewhat slighted as the audience, feeling that there HAS to be more to this scene than this!  Although it lessens somewhat later on, the film feels very rushed and pieced together.  I understand that they had quite a bit of material to work with, but the movie just seems too fast-paced.

~Elimination of important details:  I won't get into too many of the details so that I don't spoil parts of the movie, but there are some key elements in the book that play a role in future books that were eliminated in this movie.  For instance, Barty Crouch Sr.'s mysterious happening was never fully explained...actually, I think they just included it in the film just so that the audience wouldn't wonder what happened to him later on.  Also, why Priori Incantetum occurred was not explained, and the important revelation at the end of the movie was so rushed that I'm sure people who have not read the book were utterly confused.

~Voldemort:  I hate saying this, but I was slightly disappointed in Voldemort.  His appearance is not what I was disappointed in (I actually exclaimed ""Oh my God!"" in the theaters), but rather his mannerisms.  How I pictured Voldemort, the epitomy of evil, was slow-moving, deep voice, and sinister.  This Voldemort swept around the graveyard and seemed way too upbeat.  I might feel differently after I've seen the film again, but for right now, I felt that Voldemort could've been portrayed much scarier than he was.

Despite these drawbacks, this movie was extremely good, and I am very excited about seeing it again.  The Harry Potter movies have shifted from the candy-coated versions created by Chris Columbus to the way a Harry Potter movie should be.",1132358400,,6019,4.684461391801716
2506112,5,B000E6EK3S,"The 2005 release of the film version of J.K. Rowling's fourth Harry Potter book, ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"", is the darkest of the four films to date and a cinematic masterpiece.  Directed by Mike Newell, at 157 minutes, it is the longest of the four Harry Potter films to date, but because J.K. Rowling's fourth book was 734 pages long (about 300 pages longer than the third book and more than twice as long as either the first or second book), many of its subplots and details had to be left out from the film.  Otherwise, the film would have to be quite a bit longer.

That aside, what the film focuses on includes the following:

1. Use of a portkey.

2. The start of the Quidditch World Cup.

3. The attack of the Death Eaters after the game, including the Dark Lord's mark in the sky.

4. The arrival at Hogwarts of students from the other two magical schools of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang.

5. Some class time with Alastor 'MadEye' Moody (Brendan Gleeson) including his teaching of the unforgivable curses.

6. The selection of contestants for the Triwizard Tournament by the Goblet of Fire.

7. The various challenges in the Triwizard Tournament, which are all beautifully detailed and done.

8. The golden egg.

9. Harry's (Daniel Radcliffe) dreams about Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), Wormtail (Timothy Spall) and someone he doesn't know.

10. Harry gazing into Albus Dumbledore's (Michael Gambon) pensieve.

11. The Triwizard Ball, which was beautifully done.

12. The annoying Rita Skeeter (Miranda Richardson) writing gossipy articles.

13. The terrifying graveyard scene.

Some of the subplots that were examined included Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) being angry with Harry for a while, the tension between Ron & Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) due to Viktor Krum (Stanislav Ianevski) asking her to the ball, Harry's nervousness around Cho Chang (Katie Leung), Harry & Ron taking Padma Patil (Afshan Azad) & Parvati Patil (Shefali Chowdhury) to the ball, and Hagrid's (Robbie Coltrane) romance with Beauxbatons' headmistress Madame Olympe Maxime (Frances de la Tour).  Other significant characters in the film included Neville Longbottom (William Melling), Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs), Fleur Delacour (Clmence Posy), Minerva McGonagall (Maggie Smith), Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), Igor Karkaroff (Predrag Bjelac), Amos Diggory (Jeff Rawle), Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright), Fred & George Weasley (James & Oliver Phelps respecitvely), a brief appearance by Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), Moaning Myrtle (Shirley Henderson), James Potter (Adrian Rawlins), Lily Potter (Geraldine Somerville), Frank Bryce (Eric Sykes), Barty Crouch Sr. (Roger Lloyd-Pack), Barty Crouch Jr. (David Tennant), Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy), Arthur Weasley (Mark Williams) and Argus Filch (David Bradley).  Sadly, what had to be left out from the film included the Weasleys picking up Harry from the Dursley's home before the Quidditch World Cup, some of the box scenes at the Quidditch World Cup, the Sorthing Hat's song, Dobby's involvement in the story, Winky, Nearly Headless Nick's deathday party, Hermione starting her ""house-elf liberation front"" organization that she calls ""Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare"" (SPEW) and Hermione discovering Rita Skeeter's big secret.

The cinematography and special effects used in ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" are absolutely magnificent, as is the acting, including all of the many new characters.  The scenes with Voldemort in the graveyard are especially emotional, dark and powerful, including when Harry returns with the Triwizard Cup and Cedric to a stunned audience. Overall, I resoundingly rate the film version of ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" with 5 out of 5 stars and very much recommend it to anyone who enjoys J.K. Rowling's magnificent books.  Again, because the film is 157 minutes and because so much detail in the book had to be left out, the film moves very rapidly.  People who have read the book shouldn't have any difficulty with the fast pace, but those who haven't read the book could have some difficulty keeping up with the story and the many characters that J.K. Rowling introduced in the fourth book.",1132358400,,4216,5.231797919762259
2506113,3,B000E6EK3S,"This Harry Potter film was just ok, nothing to rave about.  My niece who is 10 years old and my nephew who is 4 yrs. old said it was all right, they weren't too enthusiastic after they saw the film. Usually if they really like a film, they tell me they can't wait until the DVD comes out so they can buy it, but not this time.

After the big build up of the tournament, the tasks didn't deliver any suspense or excitement, they were boring with a child-like quality to them, almost cartoonish.  What a disappointment, even the 4 year old wasn't impressed!

Personally I feel that the Harry Potter films are getting stale,
each one released is more of the same, that's why I think the children and I were not excited about this film.  I am glad
we were treated to the film and viewed it for free, I would
have been upset if I paid $40.00 for admission.  My mom liked
the trailers of the other movies better than the Potter film.

This movie leaves out everything in the book, things which we think are important to the story and to the books later on. The actors didn't fit the character descriptions (Mad-Eye Moody, Fleur, etc.) The third movie is probably the best so far. This book is my favorite of the six, but the movie is the worst so far. Sure, the movie is funny, but it just isn't the book. Two and a half hours isn't even to visually create this masterpiece.",1132358400,,571,4.447619047619048
2506115,3,B000E6EK3S,"I went into Goblet of Fire with relatively high expectations after the commendable turnaround work of Prisoner of Azkaban. After 2+ hours, I left the movie theater feeling rather... empty (and questioning whether I really had just watched a movie at all). Although, I realize the challenges that the screenwriter and director must have faced in adapting such a lengthy book, the effort was glaringly unfocused. The main theme of the 4th book was the Triwizard Tournament, yet the movie gives almost no emphasis on the overarching event besides the spectacle itself. Character development was sacrificed for special effects, and much of the core interaction seemed contrived. My main criticism is that unlike the seamless flow of Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire essentially carried itself from scene to scene with cringe-worthy transitions if any. And while the acting of the Gryffindor Trio has improved somewhat, the overall effect still left much to be desired. If forced to make a comparison, I would say that GoF is still better than Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber of Secrets but a definite regression from Prisoner of Azkaban. Ultimately, it felt as if the movie wanted to do everything at once and ended up doing almost nothing quite well enough.",1132358400,,1254,5.092233009708738
2506116,5,B000E6EK3S,"I just went to see this movie and I have to say I was pleased with it.  Many of the characters were portrayed almost exactly how I imagined them. (ex. Frank Bryce, Rita Skeeter)  The tasks were the main focus and they were exciting and fun.  The script writers did a very good job of cutting an extremely large book down to a decent size movie, while still keeping its integrity.  There was a lot of humor in the movie, which was good since the ending was darker than the rest of the movies.  I thought they handles Lord Voldemort very well, although his nose issue was kind of weird.  I also didn't really like it when Dumbledore sounded mad when Harry was picked.  I don't remember him being mad in the book.  I thought that was out of character.  The rest, however, was superb.",1132358400,,780,4.324137931034483
2506127,4,B000E6EK3S,"The movie was great, a high quality production with good characters and special effects, but as someone who didn't read the book, I found some parts hard to follow.  That was also because of the sound in the theatre - some times the voices of the characters were too quiet to make out every word.  Even so, it was good enough to follow the plot and get involved in what's happening to the characters.  Brendan Gleeson was great as Alastor ""MadEye"" Moody.  As sequels go, kind of like ""The Empire Strikes Back"" this one has a slightly darker ending that makes you anxious for the next sequel.",1132358400,,591,4.4953271028037385
2506128,5,B000E6EK3S,"Goblet of Fire is probably the best adaption so far. In this one, Harry starts having nightmares about Lord Voldermort. Which could actually be true. Voldmort's group called the Deatheaters show up at a Quidetch tournerment and cuase havoc. Besides that, someone entered him in a dangerous tournerment meant for older students. Him getting in makes kids too young for the tournerment jealous, including Ron.

  He also has to deal with a snoopy reporter named Rita Skeeter (Miranda Richardson). She has a note pad that writes whatever she tells it to write and she stretches the truth about Harry. It's entertaining but it has no conclusion like the book. The book has a very funny and fitting end that has to do with Rita Skeeter and Hermione. The Mad Eye Moody scenes are done very well though and he's well played by Brendon Gleeson (28 Days Later). He's a new professor that of course teaches Defense against the Dark Arts. He has a slilly looking fake eye and a robotic leg. Gleeson plays him as strange and whacky as he should be played.

  Mike Newell's direction is probably the best so far. This one moves along smoothly when the other ones, especially Chris Columbus' basically just skipped along and could feel like we were watching pieces from a movie trailer. He gives us more character development with the friendship of Harry, Ron and Hermione. Like in the last film Hermione and Ron barely argue about her cat being after his rat. While in the book, her having a cat gets in the way of their friendship. Here Newell spends more time with conflict between the three friends. When Hermione chooses to go to a dance with a kid from another school, Ron gets jealous just like he did in the book. Which leads to a dramatic arguement between the two.

  Newell gives this Potter film the most emotion and he reminds us that they aren't just wizards in a magical world but human beings with feelings like anyone else. So I hope he sticks around to do another one but I hear book 5 is already looking for another director. Yes he skips some things like the other directors but he keeps the right scenes to have in the movie. Potter fans will recognize what's kept out of the film but they should be happy about what was left in. This one I think is the most faithful to the books. It's as dark and violent and it should be so parents should be warned. This one unlike the first two is probably too dark and loud for kids. Especially Ralph Fiennes (Red Dragon) excellent dark and scary performance as Lord Voldermort. That even made me cringe and I'm 27 lol. This one I'd say is more for 10 and up. Since the books get darker, Newell is perfect to stay until the series is concluded. He gets it right. A dark scene where someone dies violently is about as shocking and scary as it was in the book.",1132358400,,2804,4.4931237721021615

Ok, I did like the movie, but I have read this book like 6 times because this one is my favorite. I understand that they had to leave some stuff out to make it a movie but some stuff they just plain made up. They completely left out Dobby and Wingy which sucked because I loved Winkly in the book. Rita skeeter was suppose to turning into a bug and soying on everyone but that wasn't there ether. Crouch was suppose to spill all his guts because of the Veritaserum but that didn't happen. They didn't show the trail where Crouch sent his son to Azkaban but they did mention it a little bit. The bath seen with Harry was funny but it seemed a little vulgar because Moaning Mutrfle kept trying to look at Harrys private parts.

2506130,5,B000E6EK3S,"J.K. Rowling said that the fourth Harry Potter book was where the series turns darker, but I thought that Alfonso Cuarn crossed over to the dark side by the end of the third Harry Potter movie.  Things get pretty dark by the final act of ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,"" but this film from director Mike Newell (""Four Weddings and a Funeral"") also has the most laughs of any Harry Potter movie to date, which explains why I think this early arrival for Thanksgiving 2005 it is the best of the four.

Screenwriter Steven Kloves engaged in monumental blood letting in turning Rowling's 752-page novel into a 157-minute movie (that might have the longest closing credits in the history of cinema).  Basically Kloves focuses almost exclusively on the Triwizard Tournament once you get past the introductory section, which is a severely truncated version of the World Quidditch Cup.  This mean no Dursleys, no Sorting Hat, no House-Elf Liberation Front, only one visit from Sirius Black (Gary Oldman), and no comeuppance for Rita Skeeter (Miranda Richardson).  Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs) seems to have more to do than Draco (Tom Felton), but at least the Transfiguration scene remains.  But the bare boned introduction is necessary to establish what a portkey is, that the Death Eaters are roaming again, and what the Dark Mark looks like, before getting to the Goblet of Fire and the Triwizard Tournament.

Joining the students at Hogwarts and the short-listed contenders from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang.  One champion from each school will be selected by the Goblet of Fire, with the new restriction that the champions must be of age, that is to say, seventeen years or older.  However, after the Goblet selects Fleur Delacour (Clmence Posy) from Beausbatons, Viktor Krum (Stanislva Ianevski) from Durmstrang, and Cedric Diggory (Robert Pattinson) from Hogwarts, it also selects the name of Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe).  Harry insists he did not put his name into the goblet and no one seems to believe him.  After all, Harry Potter is always achieving things beyond his youthful years.  But it seems whoever arranged for Harry to be selected has done so for the reason of getting him killed in the Tournament.

After the Goblet of Fire makes it selections the other key part of the book Kloves works into the movie is the Yule Ball.  The dance and everything leading up to it are hysterical, especially if you are younger or older than these hormonal teenagers.  Plus, Hermione (Emma Watson) is given a ""My Fair Lady"" entrance.  Most viewers are two books ahead so we know who is going to eventually end up with who, but this film underscores that Watson's character is the heart of the series, even if she does not burst into tears as often as she does in the books.  Kloves knows full well she is the emotional key to these stories and Watson is definitely the best of the young actors.  As the title character Radcliffe's actions always speak louder than words, and his chief task is usually just to look like Mary GrandPr's illustrations brought to life.  But this time when it comes to the big emotional moment he actually makes the tragedy more heartfelt (more so than the book, I dare say).

The fire-breathing dragons that are the fist challenge of the Tournament are bad enough, but it is the teenage traumas of asking girls to a ball and then having to dance with them that are really scary, which is what makes it all so funny.  But Kloves and Newell use this to set up the final challenges and the descent from the funny stuff at the Yule Ball to the dangers that Harry faces in the climax drains the darkness of even more light and explains the dead silence in the theater.  One of the best testaments to how well this film works is that you know what is coming, and it still hits hard.

Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) has less to do this time, as do Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane), McCongall (Maggie Smith), Snape (Alan Rickman), and even Filch (David Bradley), but by now they are all embodying their characters to such an extent that they maximize what little screen time they get.  Ron (Rupert Gint) is reduced to whining and moping under that mop of hair, and the Wesley Twins, Fred (James Phelps) and George (Oliver Phelps), actually have more to do in this film, stealing a lot of the scenes and hopefully setting up their pivotal roles in the next film when they end their studies at Hogwarts in a blaze of glory.  It is interesting to see what puberty has done to the cast and I love the irony that Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) is now twice Draco's size, although the fact the younger Malfoy is still a little toad works.

Of the newcomers it is clearly Brendan Gleeson as Alastor ""MadEye"" Moody who makes the biggest and best impression until Ralph Fiennes shows up as Lord Voldemort and creeps everybody out big time.  Katie Leung gets the coveted Cho Chang role and you can see why Harry falls for her, but she is only part of the giant dividing line that has fallen between the genders at Hogwarts.  Our hero and his friends talk at the end of the movie about how everything is going to become different from now on and what is really terrifying is that they have no idea how their entire world is about to turn upside down in ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.""  As the legion of Rowling readers already know, death is only beginning to make its unwanted presence known in the life of Harry Potter.",1132358400,,5441,4.674004192872117
2506131,4,B000E6EK3S,"3 1/2 Stars

Bottomline: If you have read the HP books, you will be fairly disappointed with this continuation of the movie series. The first three movies remained true (enough) to the books to maintain continuity for future films; that is not the case with the fourth movie. If you haven't read the books, there will be many scenes that will leave you confused, since not enough details have been included to keep you up with the story -- I would expect further problems in the 5th movie for the viewer who hasn't read the books (planned release in 2007). Overall, there is not enough closure given at the end of the movie and Harry's character at the (very) end of the movie does not set him up well for his behavior in the fifth movie. For spending over $130 million on this film, I expected more.

A more thorough justification of why only 3 1/2 stars...

For the readers of HP...

this movie will seem over-editted. There were many scenes that should have been included for the sake of the future movies that were ignored or left open-ended in the movie (some listed below). Trying to make the movie short is a cop-out answer for the over-editting; for instance, there were portions added in the first task and that time would have been much better spent elsewhere in making the movie more coherent (such as quickly explaining what happened to the other three contestants in the first task). It seems this is the movie that the book series and the movie series may start to diverge to a degree, unless Warner Bros. can get their stuff together -- WB needs to put out a good extended edition that fills in the holes of this movie and then make the 5th movie on the level of the first three movies.

Portions that should have made it in the film from the book, at least the first three (no risk of spoiler if you haven't read the book):

-more scenes related to or mentioning Sirius... he is HP's godfather after all and he is Harry's only representation of a parent figure! There really should be a clear bond between them.

-Dumbeldore scene with HP to help close the film (something comparable with the Dumbledore/HP scene at the end of HP1 and HP2); this was the scene I was most disappointed they didn't have (on a reasonable level) since not much closure or clarification was given at the end of the movie.

-more on the plan of action given at the end of the movie to setup the roles of Sirius, Hagrid, and Snape for the fifth movie (really needed, too!)

-more friction between HP and Snape (they hate eachother and there was only minor friction, if even that)

-Hermoine & Rita Skeeter -- help setup Skeeter's role in the next movie (that was not done whatsoever)

-A little bit more done with Mr. Crouch in the last few scenes that he was in.

-Quidditch World Cup and the First & Third (Final) Tasks; The first task was a sinkhole for money and time. That money and time would have been MUCH better spent on actually giving us a QWC and also making the final task much more interesting. This was a poor distribution of resources.

For those who haven't read the HP books...

under fairly light examination of some scenes in the movie, you will be left confused (some scenes seem to contradict eachother in explanation). I can promise the book takes care of any loose ends, but this movie certainly does not. We are not blessed with an explanation by Dumbeldore at the end of this movie as we were treated to at the end of the first or second movie (and we should have been treated to this in this movie for multiple reasons). Basically, this movie is a fairly typical action movie for the non-HP reader and not worthy of the ""Potter"" title the first three movies earned. The coherence of this movie is mediocre relative to action movies and the movie's flow is far below the level of the first three Potter movies. If you do choose to watch this movie and you cannot ignore the contradictions in the plot or characters left so open-ended, read the books for clarification (actually, read the books regardless).

This movie could have been drastically improved had they added on 15 minutes of material to include the necessary details and include all of the plot outcomes required for the next movie, unless they wish to change the fifth movie even further than they changed this one. The movie also seemed to try to end on a light note (an awkward transition and not a reflection of the book), which is not a good closure for how dark the end of the movie really was and this light mood poorly sets up the next movie.

The movie was decent, but not as good as expected. Fred and George really added a lot of humor that is reminiscent of the books and their characters were played extremely well. The acting was, overall, quite good. Special effects were excellent and computer imagery was smoothly put into the movie (they better be at the price of the film!). Sadly none of these things can really compensate for the removal of some of the scenes that are necessary for explanation. Dumbledore's character really needs work between this movie and the next -- he was far far too emotional, panicky, and not once did he represent the greatest wizard in the world during this movie (he isn't the calm and collected Dumbledore portrayed in the first three movies or in all of the books).

Let us hope they put out an extended edition for this movie so that it may redeem itself (I am talking LotR extended edition style, not deleted scenes in the special features). After viewing this movie and knowing the plot of the next movie, I'm afraid for what the next movie will be like (can it remain true to the Harry Potter characters and storyline?), unless Warner Bros. offers an extended edition of this movie that compensates for the lost scenes. Overall, WB sold out intending to make more money on non-HP fans, whereas it could have played almost entirely to the HP fans (which would have played better to non-HP fans better than this film did) -- it would have made WB more money in both categories IMO, so I really think WB dropped the ball with this film.",1132358400,,6070,4.518687329079307
2506132,5,B000E6EK3S,"A Harry Potter film is about as anticipated as a Harry Potter book. Goblet of Fire is a very good version, throwing out parts of the book (like Hermione's crusade to free the elves), but keeps the essential story of the dangerous Triwizard Competition intact. There are grim moments, of course, as Harry's destiny to be the antagonist of the evil Lord Voldermort because more clear. And there are lighter moments, like the virtual stench of hormonal raging at the Yule Ball. It proves that one can turn oneself into an animal, fly through the air, and work incredible magic, but when it comes to the opposite sex, magical teenagers are just as confused as the muggle kind. One more thing. Emma Watson's Hermione is looking more and more radiant with every movie. By the final one, she's going to be a goddess.",1132358400,,809,4.664335664335664
2506133,5,B000E6EK3S,"There is so much good to say about this movie, but I'll start by answering the major criticisms of the detractors.  Many are complaining that much from the book is left out.  This is a valid point, and viewers who have read the book no doubt notice that the story skips about.  I imagine if you haven't read the book, the story comes off as much more cohesive...you don't know what's missing.  However, it is important to note that as in Lord of The Rings, the filmmaker is attempting to adapt a large and reasonably complex book into a film of 2.5 hours.  In fact, this Potter book is far longer than any single Lord of the Rings installment.  Things ARE going to be left out....thus, for fans of the books, it is more important to look at whether the overall portrait that the movie paints is both loyal and beautiful...Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is very true to its characters and captures the beauty of Hogwarts' magic to a degree that surpasses anything in the earlier movies.  Detailed breakdown as follows:

Cinematography:

One of the things that impressed me most about Prisoner of Azkaban (Potter 3) was the beauty of the set piece scenes.  No one could deny that Harry's ride on the hippogriff was beautifully shot.  In addition, the color palette as a whole seemed many shades darker than the first two movies.  The overal effect was that the movie felt more targeted towards adults.  Goblet of Fire continues this trend.  All of the major scenes have truly beautiful scenery buttressed by some impressive CGI.  The whole movie felt like one set of wonders followed by another...I simply smiled at the beauty of much of it.

Acting:

While there are a couple of performances that are merely okay, Goblet of Fire also has several of the best performances in the series so far.  All of the regular characters are as good as or better than they have been.  Emma Watson, in particular, is shaping up to be a very convincing young actress.  Every scene that she was a part of had an emotional core that reminded me of why I cared about the three main characters in the first place.  In addition to the regulars, some of the newcomers were impressive.  Whoever played Diggory did an excellent job.  In addition, Ralph Fiennes joins the cast of the Potter movies.  I won't say who he plays, but his acting in the role was so convincing that I didn't realize that he had been in the movie until a friend pointed it out.

Score:

Perhaps one of the largest improvements in this installment of the series was the score.  John Williams, who penned the scores to the first three movies, is a master at writing compelling themes.  I find everything he writes IN BETWEEN the themes to be very dull, however.  In Goblet of Fire, Patrick Doyle takes over as composer for the series.  Williams' fantastic main theme is still very much present, but the rest of the score is far more interesting than Williams' scores were.  Stick around for the credits and you can hear a longing violin piece very much different from what Williams would have served.

Plot:

So those who read the books over and over for details will be disappointed.  They will fault the movie for not including this and that detail.  However, Goblet of Fire is one of the 2 best Potter books (the other being Prisoner of Azkaban) and director Mike Newell exploits the book to make sure that the best bits of it are onscreen.  In addition, ample attention is paid to the emotions of the characters.  The ballroom scene comes off particularly well in this capacity.  Overall, casual fans of the books as well as general audiences should very much enjoy this latest Potter story.

Conclusion:

Between the score and the cinematography, this is a very beautiful and wondrous movie.  Between the directing and acting, this is also a very emotional movie.  If you can suspend disbelief and accept Harry's cinematic and fantastic world for what it is, you're in for a very special ride, indeed.",1132358400,,3959,4.629310344827586
2506134,3,B000E6EK3S,"Basically, this movie suffers from over-editing.  I realize that the director, Mike Newell, had a lot of source material for this film, but when one edits a book in order to make a movie, care must be given to ensure the continuity of the story.  Care was not given in this case, and I and my friends were left with the feeling that we had watched a movie that forgot to tell the story.

Some basic examples of this are: we do not see the quiditch world cup match, we do not see the Death-Eaters destroy the fair-grounds, we do not watch the other wizards fight the dragons, no mention of classes, homework, or exams is ever made, we never find out if school ends due to the tragedy, we don't even find out who won the Tri-wizard tournament, and the most offensive, we never learn how the most powerful, evil wizard Voldemort is not able to kill a fledgling wizard like Harry in the Graveyard (was it a grand deus ex machina?).

Granted that the fun of the Harry Potter story comes from puzzling over enigmatic clues, but without resolution, we are left wondering what happened and why.  Luckily, I have read all of the books, but my friends were entirely in the dark.  As we left the movie, I overheard numerous conversations as individuals that read the book were explaining what had happened to the uninformed.  Obviously, if the audience is needed to bring resolution to the movie, it hasn't quite done its job.

I give this movie three stars since there are funny moments of teenage angst and thrilling scences of adventure, but the lack of storytelling hinders the movie.  The film's absolute lack of  resolution left me ill-tempered, for I felt I had been cheated after spending two-and-a-half hours watching.  I hope this does not portend the quality of the latter movies as more and more editing will be needed to parse the latter tomes into manageable scripts.",1132358400,,1870,4.602409638554217

2506137,4,B000E6EK3S,"Similar to the previous films, it's not what you don't see, but what you do see that makes it worthwhile.  I feel the Harry Potter series is difficult to transfer to film because the books are very episodic, and therefore must be approached with the willingness to sacrifice minor plot points in order to tell the ""bulk"" of the story.  In the case of Goblet of Fire, Harry is mysteriously selected to enter the Triwizard Tournament, a ploy from the resurrected Lord Voldemort.

I was truly amazed this time around.  While there is definitely tons of trimming, every moment presented on screen delivered the appropriate emotions, and captured the scenes as I remembered them from the 800-page novel.  From the introduction of the Triwizard Tournament, to the Yule Ball (a highlight in the film), to the glorious end finale, everything comes together in true Harry Potter fashion.

There were a few disappointments.  Some of the scenes that were trimmed are quite obvious; a major plot point at the beginning of the novel was severely trimmed down, to where I felt even if you hadn't read the book, you'd know that there was a gap somewhere along the line.  The film flows fairly well after that point, but at first I thought the whole movie was going to play out like a cliffnotes guide, in which you'd have to read the novel to understand it.

However, the film does come together.  I had a chance to see it in an IMAX theater, so obviously that factor took me to a whole different viewing plane all together.  The characters are well-concieved, as usual.  The relationships between Ron, Harry and Hermione flourish.  In a recent interview, Emma Watson talked about how she's grown as an actress.  I had to think to myself, they're only fifteen-year-old kids.  However, there's something incredibly magestic, the moment she walks down the stairs in her gown for the ball.  Somehow, they managed to pull that off with zeal.

Now for the PG-13 rating, which apparently a lot of parents are talking about.  First off, I thought ratings were only used as a guide for content, not themes.  In 1984, the first movie to pull off a PG-13 was Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, mainly because it depicted a man having his heart ripped out from his chest; one of the single most graphic scenes I can recall in a film, because of its purity.  That was over twenty years ago, and the film was re-rated PG on video and DVD.  The real shocker this year was Star Wars Episode III receiving the PG-13, which I can understand, but in all honesty, I question it.  Maybe it's a soft-PG-13.  They can have soft Rs, so that seems to fit.  Between Goblet of Fire, and Star Wars, there is no swearing, no nudity or sexual content; however, people are killed, a little blood is exposed, and there are strong themes.  I just thought ratings were merely for content.  In Star Wars, Anakin kills children (off-screen, of course), and graphically transforms into Darth Vader.

In Harry Potter, there are deaths, but they aren't violent at all.  In fact, the victims are cursed, and fall flat to the ground.  The only scene I can think of that could truly warrant the PG-13 is near the end, where one of the villains, Peter Pettigrew, cuts off his own hand (which happens mostly off-screen, but is certainly implied)and slashes Harry's arm, in order to resurrect Voldemort.  There is a minimal amount of blood.  The film is also more intense than the last three entries, I will give it that.  The scene where Harry fights a dragon is particularly engaging, and I see how that could potentially frighten a younger audience.

I was amazed that Warner Bros. was able to pull it off.  It's based from a very thick book, but they took what made it so emotionally gratifying and came up with a great product.  The only true complaints will most likely come from extremists (which I am), who, as usual, will squeal about just how much was cut out from the book.  But the film is such an overwhelming experience, a lot of those scenes probably won't be missed.  I simply recommend the film to anyone who enjoys fantasy.",1132358400,,4085,4.639275766016713
2506138,5,B000E6EK3S,"Although I enjoyed all of the Harry Potter films to some extent, The Goblet of Fire is the strongest entry in my opinion. The acting of the children has much improved and the special effects are outstanding this time around. This is the darkest of all the Potter films and will appeal more to an older crowd than the last three. Although I liked this film a great deal (not to mention the teaser trailer for Superman Returns), it is more of an appetizer for the meaty fantasy films, Narnia and King Kong, which will be out next month.",1132358400,,534,4.404040404040404
2506139,2,B000E6EK3S,"My family and I went and rated it 2 good, 1 OK, 2 bored.  The movie was too predictable.  There was a bit of a Soap Opera in this movie regarding who was going to take who to the ball.  The movie was too choppy.  It tried to wow us with fascinating special effects, so we didn't notice how poor of a movie this was.  Harry Potter fans want suspense and thrills with a crescendo to the finish.  Where were the Demontors?  Had to have some hint of Quidditch - enough!",1132358400,,465,4.043956043956044
2506140,5,B000E6EK3S,"Alright, let's be honest, every Harry Potter movie is disappointing to fans of the book - but this one of neccesity is the most disappointing in that SO MUCH of the fun details are deleted in favor of fitting the main story into the 2.5 hour running time. In fact, both this AND Azkaban gave me the feeling that the kids were no longer in school, but were just ""hanging out"" at Hogworts while they solve ""cases.""

But, as a fourth installment in a movie franchise, it is one of the best of the four(though I still like Chamber of Secrets best). The look is great, the effects are near flawless (except for a really stupid shot of Weasely and Diggory senior walking out of the air to the ground - the whole audience laughed when I don't think they were supposed to). While there is enough action to keep you interested, this one has far more ""normal"" scenes than the previous films. In fact, and ironically, I'd say the BEST portion of the film is a 30 - 40 minute stretch involving the kids trying to ask each other to a dance, and the dance itself. There is little to no ""magick"" in these scenes, just great writing and great perfomances. It was like a Potter version of DAWSON'S CREEK (A Teen Soap Opera here in the states, for those who don't know). It is in these great scenes (including my favorite of the whole film, in Snape's class) that these actors are finally showing their true acting abilities. The timing is perfect and the performances golden! It gives me alot of hope for the next two books which are much more performance than action driven!

So - as it relates to the book, it is a bit of a letdown - it is really a RUN through the book. But, as a slimmed down version of a gargantuan novel, I think they did a FANTASTIC job! Great work from everyone!

Two quibbles:

1) John Williams fans may lament the lack of his score - the music is certainly not lacking, but that bit of magic is.

2) The adult characters continue to be marginalized - I know this isn't their movie, but Snape and McGonagal seem to be mere cameos these days, and poor Miranda Richardson as Rita Skeeter - I was stoked to hear she was in the film, but she had one big scene, one minor scene, and that was it!  Her character arch never goes anywhere.  And let's not mention Gary Oldman's ONE appearance in CGI form!",1132358400,,2304,4.319444444444445
2506141,2,B000E6EK3S,"My first impression of Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire was... confusion. Sure, I have NEVER read ANY of the books, but that is more due to lack of time and the chance to give an ""outsider's"" review of the movies than anything else.

""Goblet"" is a choppy piece of work with little or no emotion, no character development as far as I can see, and short cuts of moments.

I was entertained for about fifteen minutes, then became increasingly agitated at the choppy way this movie was cut together. The score is HORRIBLE! To say the least. If the music underlying each scene were a bit more poignant, I might have been able to tell what the characters were supposed to be feeling. As it is cut, this movie seems to have taken the following procedure for storyline:

Grab that scene, cut! Here's a moment, CUT! Here's an important change in a character with no underlying motivation or emotion, CUT! OOOOOOO!! ACTION!! CUT!!

And on and on...

The character(s) who may or may not have died have very little tragedy to them. The score is as much to blame as the direction given (lack of direction?) by Newell. If the music would have been more innovative and introduced anything new, it would have helped the movie greatly. As it is, the score just sits there the same under each scene. Even the dragon chasing Harry has UNexciting music behind it.

The Death Eaters are in no way threatening. Harry is lost in the shuffle of it all. Valdemort is a whiny little twit of a morphing mess with NO POWER and NO PRESENCE and definitely NO MENACE whatsoever. Tom Riddle has more power and presence than any of the characters/actors in the entire film! Of course, that has a lot to do with his appearance and savagery in ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" than anything else. Hermione is just there as eye candy. Ron has a bit to play with as a friend betrayed, yet no depth is given to any emotion in this movie.

Here is a film that should have been four hours long to give it ANY JUSTICE in the world. At UNDER two hours and thirty minutes (fill in the rest with ten minutes of credits), this movie is CHOPPY and lacking emotional depth, intensity, and direction.

Mike Newell should be ASHAMED!

2506142,3,B000E6EK3S,"This movie was - at the very best - mediocre for a Harry Potter film. The acting was fantastic - even Dumbledore, though still coming off a bit rough, isn't ill-tempered as he looks in the preview - but the directing was a disaster!! The director tried to give a gothic vertical feel to a horizontal medium, and it all looks crushed together, cluttered, and mundane! There were very few good screen shots. How he made Hogwarts feel like a nothing but a common old stone castle on a desolate rock I'll never figure out, but he did. He left the magic out of the middle of the film, leaving poorly balanced choppy bits of plot. (Example: There was really no suspense leading up to the climactic scene, so Voldemort looked like a bald monkey - and no red eyes!) I think this director never felt a magic or spiritual moment in his life and must have a rather ill opinion of humanity. He managed to suck most of the magic out of Harry Potter! I've never seen a film Alan Rickman couldn't save.

The whole thing makes no sense to someone who hasn't read the book. The director left out so many critical scenes and actually added ones that were redundant, like the teachers giving dancing lessons to the kids. (What moron needs to ADD plot elements to this story?) He showed Neville getting upset over the spider getting cursed, but never explained why! He included Moody, but never showed his demise after he turns back into Crouch Jr., or what a pill Fudge is. He never showed St Mungo's, or Arthur getting bitten, or Sirius in the fire - it's just red coals in his visage - or as a dog (Gary Oldman isn't even in the film!), or Lupin, or any Quiddich (they just show before and after the World Cup match). They never explain why the wands 'grab' each other, or why Harry sees his parents.

There were some funny scenes thanks mostly to the actors themselves, like Filch dancing with Mrs. Norris. The boys staring stupidly at the girls and them giggling back was funny - at first, but was done to death. But there were some really stupid and nasty additions, like Moaning Myrtle coming on to Harry, and Cedric and Harry actually pushing each other in the maze to get to the cup until Cedric is attacked by tree roots (no fire crabs in this movie) and calls for Harry's help; and by the way, Harry almost doesn't go back to help him! Really out of character! Speaking of out of character, Krum is passed off as kind of a dumb jock. Hermione is kind of weepy at the Yule Ball, and her conflict with Rita Skeeter is never developed. Rita never becomes a beetle. I understand why they had to leave out some things, like the Weasley family blasting through the Dursley fire place (no Dursley is in this either), but I can't think why Rowling allowed the director so much latitude with her story.

Anyway, it's worth seeing it for the acting. The only disaster was the directing, but what a major disaster! I bought tickets in advance and waited an hour in line for this?",1132358400,,2959,4.425688073394495

Rowling!!!!,1132272000,,406,4.0875
2506154,4,B000E6EK3S,"This film tore me in two. I mean that. I'm so conflicted about this one that I intend to spend the next few days wandering in confusion. First, however, I offer what may be the last sound thoughts I have for a while.

Last year, I watched in wonder as the outstanding director Alfonzo Cuaron took my least favorite book from the Potter series and turned it into a cinematic masterpiece. I probably wouldn't have bothered with Goblet tonight if Azkaban wasn't on HBO earlier tonight, reminding me how great the Potter series can be.

Then I remembered who would be playing Voldemort, and I rushed to the theater.

Ralph Fiennes brief but timeless performance as the Dark Lord (no, not that dark lord) was everything I had hoped for and more, and Goblet of Fire contains some of the most emotional power of any Potter film.

But there was something missing. It didn't really bother me that many of the subplots were trimmed or completely abandoned. Dumbledore's demeanor in this one bothered me from time to time, but it's not the bulk of it.

What really bugged me was the way the film launched into the action sequences early on, and then doesn't bother to give the sequences payoff. We see a brilliant introduction to the Quidditch World Cup, which immediately cuts to the afterparty. If you don't pay careful attention, you might not even pick up which team won (although the lady sitting behind me would've been happy to shout it out for you, that is if she could figure it out). Everything in the first act moves way too fast, so we never get a chance to get our bearings. It's just one special effects sequence followed by another, all thrown together in a heaping mess.

Then the film calms down and stops to take time with the characters. This is what I like to see. We see adolescent angst handled with much more realism than John Hughes ever could (keep in mind, this is a Harry Potter movie we're talking about), and we see hints of a world waiting on the brink of disaster.

Which brings me to Dumbledore, that old, kind-hearted Professor who should gracefully juggle the burden of his students. We see him grow desperate. In the best scene in film, we see him tapping his thumb during a brief pause, completely at a loss for words. This scene is surprisingly effective, given the fact that he'd seemed extremely bitter and desperate throughout the entire film. Half-Blood Prince truly caught me off guard when Dumbledore's own doubts, his own hopes are finally revealed. His behavior here ruins that because here he never seems confident.

But don't let that stop you. This is still an extremely good film, filled with laughs and surprises and tears and hopes and despair. I was particularly impressed by the ballroom scene, not so much by the waltzing as by the magical rock band that followed it up. The way the scene was constructed reminded me of my own senior prom.

Yet I still can't get past that first act. I could almost hear the director Mike Newell saying to the editor, ""We have to get this out of the way so we can get to the movie."" Maybe I'm just being anal.",1132272000,,3085,4.564195298372513
2506155,5,B000E6EK3S,"I hate to admit that this Harry Potter movie was not a disappointment. Why? Because, hello? All the other Harry Potter movie does not contain the spirit of the greatest book in the whole-wide-world, and is just a kid-dy movie that's only attracting viewers because of the Harry Potter (book) series. I expected to see this movie and leave with complains and all, but only I didn't.

I found out that this movie is going to come out way back in July and I have planned the premiere show in my city with a couple of my friends since then. Even though I hated the movies (once again, because of the books), I was looking forward to see it because there are a lot of new characters and also, Goblet of Fire was the most exciting book in the series (well, all of them are anyways). So last night, at ten, I got ready, feeling very excited, and set off to see the latest Harry Potter film. When we are allowed to enter the theater, people slowly fill in the seats and by hour before the movie begins and I can tell you this, the whole theater was full and I heard from the ticket lady that all the tickets were sold out, so I was thinking along the lines that, ""Oh good, JK Rowling would be proud."" I mean, true, I dislike the films, but still, I am a HUGE fan of ""Harry Potter"", so basically, anything ""Harry Potter"" related, I am in.

Now, the movie. First off, if you are the readers, like me, please forgive them (the film makers...oh and I try to, too) because you can't really fit a almost 800 page book into a 2 and a half hour movie. I mean, if you respect the author, then you should think that, becuase Jo thought the movie is great.

Overall, I thought that this movie was great. So, you might ask, ""Did they change the scenes from the book?"" Well, yes, of course, they can't really fit all of the scenes from the book to the movie; is simply impossible. But let me tell you, is not that bad like it was in the Prisoner of Azkaban, the changes that were made in this movie fits and it flows perfectly. The only problem there is is that they were rushing too fast from the beginning and then they rush throw the tasks. Also, they did not really explain what the Triwizard Tournament is and one of my friend, who have never read the books, was very confused about what the character were doing in the movie, but overall, she thought that it was a great movie anyway.

The thing that I loved about this movie is how funny every other scene is. It is not like the first three films: example from the third movie, Ron and his spider boggart which its legs turn into skates thingy. But seriously, this film contains a laugh scene every other scene, almost every scene, well, except for the Voldemort scene, right? And even after ""that"" tragedy happened, the movie still have something to laugh at. I guess Mike Newell is such a comical type of director, and he seriously made this movie rock. Everytime I go see the movie, since the first, I just watch it once in the theater and wait til it comes out in DVD and then watch it again then, but this time, I already wanted to see it again even though I just saw it last night til three in the morning. Bottom line, this movie is filled with magic.",1132272000,,3194,4.257001647446458
2506156,3,B000E6EK3S,"HPGOF is as entertaining as it can be. The special effects are great, and the acting is good too. The best sequences come in the ball scenes. My one complaint is there seems to be a lack of character development, and the story line has become kind of bland.",1132272000,,257,4.26530612244898
2506157,3,B000E6EK3S,"I never thought I'd be able to say this, but Harry Potter has disappointed me.

I fully expected ""Goblet of Fire"" to surpass the first three films in the series. The books keep getting better and better, and so do the movies. I think ""Prisoners of Azkaban"" was the best of the first three Harry Potter movies, in spite of the fact that so much material had to be cut. Since the ""Goblet of Fire"" book is more than 700 pages long, I knew that a lot of the story would be lost in the movie version, and I was okay with that. I'm also aware that, at this point, the filmmakers are pretty much making these movies for people who are fans of J.K. Rowling's novels. A lot of things aren't explained in detail in the films: it is assumed that the audience has read the book and already knows what's going on. That was the case with ""Prisoner of Azkaban,"" which left some people who hadn't read the book in the dark about some things.

I saw ""Goblet of Fire"" tonight with two people who have NOT read the book. They were confused by a number of things in the movie, which is totally understandable. I think the screenplay was pretty crappy overall. It's like the filmmakers didn't feel the need to explain ANYTHING, which was a bit ridiculous. It's one thing to assume that the audience knows enough about the book to figure out some things on their own, but it went overboard with this movie. I have a feeling that people who haven't read the book are going to leave the theatre feeling very shafted, and that might turn them off the Harry Potter series forever, which is a shame.

Let me get back to the details of the movie. A lot of things that were in the book had to be cut from the movie because there simply wasn't enough time to show everything. As a result, the filmmakers also had to take a few liberties with the script to compensate for a few things. For example, there were no house elves in the film at all, and therefore the whole incident where Winky uses Harry's wand to conjure the Dark Mark at the World Cup had to be rewritten. (Everything pretty much happened the same way as it does in the book, except we actually see Barty Crouch Jr. perform the spell at the start of the film...not a big deal.) It's always disappointing when such good book material has to be omitted from the film adaptation, but that's life. There's only so much material you can cram into two and a half hours, and overall I think the editors did a good job deciding what to delete from the film.

HOWEVER...this movie sucks on several other levels. It makes absolute sense that a lot of material from the book had to be cut from the movie, but why were so many other scenes added to the movie that weren't in the book? They were unnecessary and did nothing to enhance the film. In fact, all of those extra scenes could have been trashed in favor of including more original material from the book. Also, ""Goblet of Fire"" included a lot of what I call ""stupid humor,"" and once again, none of it was taken from Rowling's book. Why did Moody make the spider dance all over the students' faces? Why did Fred and George start rolling around on the floor fighting after they sprouted their beards? Why did they invent that stupid scene where Hermione has to play the part of monkey-in-the-middle messenger when Ron and Harry aren't speaking? Why did Moody stuff the ferret version of Draco Malfoy down another kid's pants? Why was Fleur practically eaten alive by the maze and Harry attacked by a bowl full of licorice? None of that made any sense to me.

There were other things that really bothered me, too. Why were all the girls decked out in fancy gowns at the Yule Ball when they were supposed to be wearing dress robes? How come Fleur and her Veela counterparts weren't all shimmery like they are in the books? All they did was do a stupid butterfly dance when they waltzed into the Great Hall for the first time. Also, what was up with the freaking ACROBATICS that the Durmstrang guys performed when they arrived at Hogwarts?! That DEFINITELY is not in the book! Why did Harry's dragon task turn into a ridiculous chase around the entire proximity of the school grounds? I cringed during the part where Harry got stuck on the ledge of the tower...why did they feel the need to do that? And is the poor dragon supposed to DIE at the end? That sucks! Why was Snape smacking Ron and Harry on their heads when they were talking during study hall? That was so ridiculous that I wanted to cry. Snape is a badass...he wouldn't tap the boys on the back of their heads like that! They practically turned Snape SOFT in this movie! (Come to think of it, Draco was kind of wussy this time around, too, and that's just not right. Would Draco Malfoy really be sitting up in a tree like that? Come on! That looked so lame.) And why did they make it look like Harry and Cedric were racing each other to the death in the maze to get to the Triwizard Cup? That's not how it happened in the book, and I see no good reason to change something like that. ARRRGH!

I wasn't thrilled with all the new additions to the cast, either. I really liked the kids who played Cho Chang and Cedric Diggory, and the guy who played Viktor Krum looked EXACTLY the way I have always pictured him when I read the book. Ralph Fiennes was excellent as Lord Voldemort, as I knew he would be. Miranda Richardson was perfectly cast as Rita Skeeter...it's unfortunate that she only had about five minutes of screen time. However, I was very disappointed with Brendan Gleeson's performance as MadEye Moody. He was too comical most of the time, and he needed to be a much darker, creepier character. (I hated the scene where he stuck his tongue out at Professor McGonagall...that was so wrong!) I didn't care for the actor who played Barty Crouch Jr., either. Oh well.

Please don't interpret this to mean that I absolutely hated the movie...that's not the case at all. I am a huge Harry Potter fan and I really did enjoy it. There were a lot of scenes that were really good, and everything that happens after Harry and Cedric grab the portkey cup is phenomenal. (Then again, they totally ruined the end of the movie by ending it on a happy, uplifting note. Cedric is DEAD and Lord Voldemort is BACK, and yet all the students are giggling and chatting and Harry, Ron, and Hermione are chuckling about writing letters over the summer?! PLEASE! What a load of crap.)

Go see the movie. It was worth my $10...I was just expecting more, that's all.",1132272000,,6487,4.413533834586466

Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire may be the second best film in the series, after the first one, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (2001.)

The running theme this time around is that everyone is coming of age. Girls and boys are beginning to discover one another and you see lots of funny and awkward moments.

Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is selected to host this year's Tri Wizard Tournament. It's a series of challenges featuring one representative from three wizard schools and the winner goes down in history. You have to be 17 to enter, says the Ministry of Wizardy, since it is very challenging and dangerous. Three candidates are selected by the goblet spitting out paper with the name of the selected entrant. But, a fourth name is spit out, and it's Harry's. He's 14 but the officials decide that the goblet must be respected and Harry must compete. It's just a tad hard to understand how kids could be allowed to compete in a contest with real life and death consequences, but that's what we have here. The part of the challenge that takes place underwater may be a bit disturbing to some, when you discover what ""items"" the kid wizards are supposed to recover from the depths.

A new teacher of Defense of the Black Arts shows up, Mad-Eye Moody. He's got almost what looks like a cyborg eye and he befriends Harry...

The final challenge involves the hedge maze, spread over what appears to be acres of land. But, there's more to it than just capturing the prized cup and you know it involves someone very naughty... Evil, in fact.

Mike Newell (Four Weddings and A Funeral) will have his biggest hit to date, no doubt. Michael Gambon (65) does such a credible job replacing the deceased Richard Harris for the second time (72) that you almost don't even notice two people have played the role. Rupert Grint (16) is Grinch-like as former wimp, Ron Weasley, someone with a chip on his shoulder. There's something eating him that causes tension between him and Harry. Is it jealousy? Or is it their mutual attraction to Hermoine (Emma Watson, 14)? Watson is whip-smart as the proud, self-confident Hermoine and while her male friends notice how she is sprouting into a little hottie, they don't have the guts to ask her to the ball. Still, she displays moments of vulnerability that makes her character well-rounded. To be honest, it's Daniel Radcliffe (15) who comes up as the weakest of the main actors in this film. He comes across as being pleasant but not terribly interesting, even with the aura of being the child-prodigy super-wizard. Harry doesn't come across as being cocky but at the same time, Radcliffe's performance is tepid at best. He's not a fireball of acting talent and isn't as interesting as his supporting cast.

Tons of laughs from the audience. Prior to the start of the film, someone stood up and asked the audience to sing happy birthday to one of his friends, and they did! Lots of applause at the end. As usual, this film is feast for the eyes, but more so, with lots of opposite sex attraction, it shows how the franchise is growing up.",1132272000,,3104,4.653284671532846

2506160,5,B000E6EK3S,"After seeing the slice-and-dice job that Alberto Cuaron did on the third Harry Potter film, I went to see ""Goblet of Fire"" with some trepidation, wondering just how much Mike Newell had cut out of the book. Well, there are some sizeable cuts indeed, given the size of the book, a hefty tome over 700 pages, but I'm glad to say that Newell knew what to cut and what to keep intact. ""Goblet of Fire"" remains pretty true to J.K. Rowling's book, and if Newell had to wield a pretty big pruning knife, he did retain almost everything of substance.

Just like the book, ""Goblet of Fire"" starts off with a gruesome murder at the old Riddle house where the evil Lord Voldemort is hanging on in some kind of twilight existence. He's getting stronger and he's lusting for revenge. Quick cut to the Weasley house, where Harry has just bolted wide awake, his scar burning, dreaming about the murder in the Riddle house. Harry, Hermione and the Weasleys are off to the world quidditch tournament, which we don't see much of, and which ends in mayhem when Voldemort's Death Eaters set off the Dark Mark, causing general pandemonium. Time to head back to Hogwarts anyway, where Headmaster Dumbledore announces that instead of the usual quidditch matches (Rowling was probably growing tired of writing about quidditch anyway), the school will host the Triwizard tournament, which had been suspended for some years after the death rate among the contestants got rather out of hand. Three wannabe contestants' names are spat out of a goblet burning blue flame: a Hogwarts hunk named Cedric Diggory, a Beauxbatons siren named Fleur Delacoeur, and Durmstrang's finest, Viktor Krum, an already famous professional quidditch player. Just as the stir over the contestants' names dies down, the goblet spits out a fourth name: guess whose?

Harry has to deal with considerable jealousy from his Hogwarts peers who suspect he's jinxed the pot in his favor, not the least from his best friend, Ron Weasley, who's irked that Harry always seems to get all the attention. But after the first task in the tournament, which involves getting halfway fricasseed by fire-breathing dragons, both Harry and Ron realize that whoever snuck Harry's name into that goblet is planning on Harry having a particularly short life span.

The second task involves an underwater battle with mer-people and the third has the contestants entering an enchanted maze where things quickly turn extremely nasty. Harry and Cedric find the prize at the end of the maze and both take it together, but whoa -- the prize turns out to be a portkey which lands them smack-dab into the lair of You-Know-Who. The Triwizard tournament may be an inter-school competiton but this dude isn't playing games; somebody is going to die.

The three young stars have developed in this film; no longer children, they're teenagers getting interested in the opposite sex. Harry develops a crush on a cute little Asian named Cho Chang, who unfortunately has a crush on the hunky Cedric Diggory (this young man is so gorgeous he should be on a calendar). The relationship between Ron and Harry undergoes its first real test when Ron's jealousy of Harry's prominence almost undermines their friendship. Rupert Grint is especially effective in this film; in the first three movies he was simply Harry's sidekick but in this one he's more his own person. The Weasley twins, well played by Jamie and Oliver Phelps, continue to provide comic relief; they're just right for their roles. And Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid is a hoot squiring about the ten-foot-tall Madame Maxine from Beauxbatons. I have a problem with a few characters in this film; Michael Gambon is still not, and probably never will be, a worthy successor to Richard Harris in the role of Dumbledore, and Draco Malfoy's role has been reduced in each successive film to a couple of jeers and sneers. He's become almost inconsequential. But a couple of new additions add juice to the film: Brendan Gleeson is a riot as Mad Eye Moody, and as the diabolical Lord Voldemort, Ralph Fiennes is dead-on perfect. This guy oozes malice from every rotten pore. He may be too scary for small children to watch, but he sends delicious shivers up older spines.

Newell's direction is superb throughout, and it shows especially in how he choreographs the scenes with special effects. Harry battling the dragon and the merpeople is so believable it's hard to believe it was staged. Newell doesn't go for special effects for their own sake, either, which would have made it one more ultimately boring action/adventure film; the effects are woven seamlessly into the story and, like all good special effects, they support the film instead of dominating it.

""Goblet of Fire"" runs over two hours but doesn't seem that long. It's a magic/tragic joyride that leaves us exhilarated and somber at the same time. You-Know-Who is back, and he's dealing death all around him. The look of determined resolution on Harry's face at the end of the film tells Voldemort, bring it on.

The only scene I wish Newell hadn't cut out of the film was the hilarious visit of the Weasleys to the Dursley house when Mr. Weasley blasted the Dursley's fireplace halfway across the living room. But it's a minor cavil. ""Goblet of Fire"" is very good indeed, the second-best in the series so far (my favorite is still ""Chamber of Secrets""). Newell got it right.

2506162,3,B000E6EK3S,"The Quidditch match, which was wonderfully set up for the audience, did not happen. It showed the stadium and the wild uproar and excitement building up, next thing you see the match is over and they're in their tents when Ron's dad comes along and says they have to run. Run they did. No explanation as to why they were running. This is too bad because it was something I was looking forward too and that in itself says something given that I'm not generally a sports fan. They could have left the whole stadium scene out for all the good it did. The director skipped over too much good stuff and left a lot of questions. For example,you see Lucsious in the graveyard with Valdemort and then there's no mention of him after that. Did Harry discuss that with Dumbledor? Dumbledor usually manages to ferret stuff out. You'd think that after Ceddrick was brought back dead that Dumbledor would be chatting with Harry. Nope, that whole bit was left out. Dumbledor's character was not well played. Definitely more emotional and that's just not Dumbledor. Even Hermione's character seemed to be overplayed. I don't blame that on the actress so much as I do on the director in this case as she's played that role several times now. Good to see something mentioned of Snavely's character. Snavely's character information will be important for later. The movie did not end well as Valdemort's return was not discussed with Dumbledor. There was no ""movie closure"". As a writer, at least I would have addressed that. Yes, this was an over edited film. What was with the ""grand"" entrances from the other schools? Did they do that in the book? Seemed pretty tacky and showy, which also leads me to think that it was the director's ""vision"" as well.

I understand that this was a big book that had to be cut down for film size but it seems to me better choices could have been made. They could have cut the whole first ten minutes out of the movie and probably not affected the film. If you can tell what was edited out of a movie, then it was a movie that could have been better. It was an okay movie for what it was but it could have been better. This is one movie that I think SHOULD be remade. Glad I went to the matinee.",1132272000,,2212,4.461728395061728
2506163,5,B000E6EK3S,"The best of the Potter movies. Yes, dark in spots, but definately balanced by some sharp comedy. The overall setting and lighting of the movie was spot-on, as well as the casting of the new  characters. Mad Eye Moody was, in my estimation, perfect - moments of humour offset his general dark and dangerous persona. I can see where the character will have extensive development room in his part when it comes ""Order of the Phoenix"" time. Krum and his schoolmates were just as I pictured them when I read the story, as were Fleur and her mates. Harry and his friends have matured extremely well in their characters, as have many of our old friends, especially Neville. Again, the new additions were perfect characterizations. Madame Maxime could not have been cast more perfectly for the part, and our ""new"" Dumbledore seems much more comfortable in his role this time around - much more so than I felt he was in his role in ""Prisoner"". Although I must admit, I dearly miss the great Richard Harris. He will always be Dumbledore in my heart.

The entry of the two schools onto the Hogwarts grounds offered stunning graphics, as did all of the rest of the movie. It was a feast for the eyes of a graphics junky like myself. Each scene offered new and more dazzling effects, without the feeling of being overdone or blown out of proportion. Each a perfect fit for the scene in question.

The only complaint I really have to offer deals with how ""rushed"" the first part of the movie felt. I would agree very much with the reviewers who are disappointed that the movie wasn't cut into two movies (note to producers - I would have Gladly forked out the extra funds to see two movies instead of one, as, I am sure, all true Potter fanatics!) By trying to push everything into one movie, some really brilliant portions such as the Quiddich match, the first Challenge, and a few other choice portions of the book, were given short shrift. If I weren't aware of the back story for Mr. Crouch, it may have been difficult to understand what was going on, since so much had to be sacrificed to fit within the time limits of the film. It is a true shame! Seeing what this director was able to do with the story and design, I would have dearly loved to have seen what he could have done with such marvelous set pieces. There were overall very few things which were changed from the text to the film this time around (unlike ""Prisoner"" which, though it was my favorite book, is by far my least favorite movie of the series). One particularly funny moment, though quite scary in itself, was the moment when Valdemort comes to life. The cinema was extremely quiet,when a little girl a few rows behind me shouted ""His eyes are supposed to be RED!!!"" The whole cinema broke into gales of laughter! Neville delivering the gilly weed was disappointing - I was very much looking forward to seeing Dobby again. These are, however, understandable losses given the short structure of the film. Again, disappointing that the ""Powers That Be"" didn't see fit to make two films instead of one.

Overall, I was truly enamoured of the film, and hope that we are given the pleasure of this director and crew for the next Potter film. I am taking friends next week - a second dose of my ""Addiction!""",1132272000,,3264,4.536502546689304
2506164,4,B000E6EK3S,"This is the darkest one in all the series so far (no surprise if you know the book).  It is not your good-feeling films.  Despite the darkness of the film, there are some funny moments.  It did cut out lots of stuff just to fit it into the time constraint.

It would be nice if the quddish(sp) match in the beginning is a bit longer.  Also would be nice if the dragon stuff also show what the other champion gone through.

It is good that you see the struggle in Harry in making the right moral decisions in real time.

Since there are so much stuff in the book, the film really do not have the time to develope the characters the way the book does.

Overall a good film despite its darkness",1132272000,,691,4.142857142857143
2506165,5,B000E6EK3S,"A fairy tale beginning has now turned into a dark and mischievous journey for the teen wizard Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe).  It first was a warm and amusing adventure with some suspense in the initial film.  However, even after the first cinematic adaptation of J.K. Rowling's fantasy novel the films have become increasingly darker to the point where the rating now has been bumped up from PG to PG-13 in the fourth installment of Harry Potter.  The elevated rating on Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire might suggest that Harry Potter is aging and his life is now turning increasingly more difficult, as both adolescence and evil forces intensify its influences on his life.

J.K. Rowling addresses notions of magic, a parallel fantasyland reached by strange methods of travel, and many fantastic creatures, which is brought to life through director Mike Newell's fantasy coming of age vision.  In the fourth episode of Harry Potter, Harry has reached the midpoint of his adolescence.  It is also a time when he is highly susceptible to influences around him.  The film shrewdly illustrates the coming of age of the teen wizard and his friends, as they all face the predicaments of adolescence.  Through its a clever narration Potter and his friends deal with teenage obstacles and choices, often for the first time, which can have a significant impact on the rest of their life.  Symbolically, the same concept is brought through the lurking evil that seems to meddle underneath the surface of the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.  These evils fizzle through by initially teasing and belittling, which eventually turns into alienation and vicious bullying.

The story opens with a foreboding presentation of a huge snake swirl out of a wall.  It leads the audience to a remote location where a groundskeeper notices a light in the mansion of which he is the caretaker.  Lets put it this way, the caretaker has an unpromising future when he detects the light, as the servants of Lord Voldemort are preparing for something wicked in the mansion, and their plan involves Harry Potter.  In addition, Lord Voldemort, Potter's nemesis and the murderer of his parents, a frail voice indicates his presence, but his full persona is never revealed. This brief opening does not only suggest, but promises the audience about something dreadful.

Meanwhile, Potter and his friends are enjoying the summer vacation away from Hogwarts, as they are about to visit the Quidditch World Cup between Ireland and Bulgaria.  However, festivities at the World Cup are suddenly interrupted by the nightmarish Dead Eaters while Lord Voldemort's sign burns in the sky in the form of a skull and a snake.  Here the film moves a little too rapidly, which causes some awkwardness.  However, it reflects on the monumental task that screenwriter Steven Kloves faced while turning this epic book to film into a 2 and half hour epic film.  The film might have been twice as long if it was a strict adaptation.

Back at Howarts, Potter and his buddies learn that a change for the school year is that two other schools will be visiting, and that there will be a competition between the schools called the Triwizard Tournament.  This is an ancient tradition that is brought to the academies to foster understanding and friendship between the cultures and countries, which should help building bridges between the people.  The rules of the competition are simple, only one wizard student from each school can participate and they have to be of the age of 17.  Potter does not have to worry about the dangerous tournament, which could have lethal consequences, as he is only 15.  However, something goes wrong when a fourth mysterious name is called that violates the rules of the tournament.  The name is Harry Potter.

Ostracized, alienated, and bullied Potter finds himself being pushed away from friendships and belonging, as he is thought of as a cheater.  It turns into a dangerous journey where he could opt for the easy solution, and turn his back on his friends.  Dangerous decisions have to be made that can have lasting consequences on Potter's life and on those he knows.  At the same time, he must face teen issues such as love, attention, and popularity, as a school ball is about to take place.

There are also some captivating side stories such as Potter's studious friend Hermione (Emma Watson) falling in love with Krum, a Bulgarian Quidditch athlete who also is competing in a Triwizard Tournament.  Ron (Rupert Grint) has to deal with feelings of insecurities based on feeling like a misfit and an undesirable.  There are also new friendships that evolve in the film with new characters, and it intentionally teaches the audience the value of lasting friendships.

The fantasy novels about Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling have swept the world in a fire of imagination and adventure.  When the decision of adapting these stories to a cinematic experience the world has to prepare themselves for shortened Rowling's adventures, as the books stretch between 600 and 700 pages.  On occasion, the screenplay adaptation generates some awkwardness, as it moves a little to swiftly through scenes and leaves the viewer with questions.  Yet, this fourth film of Harry Potter elevates above the previous three films, as it leaves the audience with an intelligent narrative well performed by a terrific cast that deals with many of the ambiguous issues of adolescence.

The film also has an overwhelming amount of sorcery and magic, which naturally weaves together with a large amount of strange creatures in the film.  However, it is within this imaginative world that the audience can both escape reality while pondering the many serious issues in the world in the light of the fantastic adventure that the film presents.  It delivers a truly unique and mesmerizing journey that brings the viewer through emotional agony and the physical pain of a normal teenager named Harry Potter.",1132272000,,5972,4.987891019172553
2506166,4,B000E6EK3S,"Just saw the lastest Harry Potter Movie today...Very good special effects.  The story line ran too fast into each scene though.  Feel that it would be very confusing for someone who has not read the books.  Luckily we have, many times.",1132272000,,235,4.682926829268292
2506167,5,B000E6EK3S,"Despite the negative review found elsewhere here, I found the movie to be extremely well done.  CGI characters?  Well, how else are you going to have a dragon that breathes fire?  There are some relationships that are drastically minimized here - Hagrid and Maxime don't get a spat as they do in the book, and Rita Skeeter, although she is still in this movie, is so minimized that I almost wish she had been left out, except that she'll be needed in other movies to come.

The sad thing in the condensation, particularly at the beginning, is that there was no room for the great quidditch championship game.  This makes the presence of Krum and the aura around him far less established.  Also we lose the Dursleys this time around.  The book has the funniest scene so far with them and the Weasleys, but it got lopped off.

The actors are getting better and better.  Daniel Radcliffe is becoming very good at conveying a wide range of emotions with barely a flick of his eyebrows.  His obvious comfort with Emma Watson (Hermione) and Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) shows in every scene they have together.  It is also pleasant to see more of the twins and Neville Longbottom.  The adult regulars are also wearing well into their roles.

The new comers, particularly Robert Pattinson (Cedric), are very well cast, although Clemence Poesy could have stood a little more of the veela aspect.

The direction captures the story line quite well, injecting humor where it is possible, and building the scary scenes really skillfully.  Go see it, and hope that there is an extended edition when the DVD comes out.  He lets the relationships be seen.  Talk isn't the only way to make it clear that someone likes someone else!

The soundtrack CD is wonderful, too, except for the songs slapped on at the end.  They are quite jarring, as is that moment in the movie when one of those songs is played at the Christmas Ball.",1132272000,,1908,4.641791044776119
2506168,5,B000E6EK3S,"It's undeniable. The Harry Potter movie franchise keeps getting better. With each film comes a new style, which keeps these films completely fresh. Though I was disappointed to see Cuaron bow out of directing the fourth movie (he directed the third one), Mike Newell does a spectacular job, especially since I just kept thinking of him as ""that dude who directed that funeral movie with Hugh Grant."" I'll remember his name now.

All the familiar faces are back, though they may not be quite so familiar because they all look so different compared to the baby-faced plumpness of the first and second movies. Harry Potter, Ron, and Hermione all attend the Quidditch World Cup with Ron's dad and new character Amos Diggory, along with his son, Cedric. During the event someone casts the Dark Mark into the sky-- Lord Voldemort's mark. Then the Death Eaters come tromping through the campground, looking frightening in their skull masks and black cloaks. Who cast the mark? No one's sure. So off the children go to school, wondering what will happen this year, as they can never have a ""quiet year,"" as Hermione says. Yes, this is the movie in which we finally see Lord Voldemort with a body, and this was actually the only thing I was disappointed with. Ralph Fiennes is amazing, but the makeup effects are shoddy. He's a giant Gollum. But still, the movie is great. Great great great.

I have read the books, but I don't really like comparing them to these movies. I prefer to (usually) consider a movie as its own separate entity. I'm not going to complain about silly subplots that are missing because they're missing for a reason. (Yes, I'm implying that even Rowling should have deleted at least a couple of her silly subplots... a big black marker should be taken to the fifth book especially. The sixth is good, though...) Anyway, this is a great movie. It's best if you go in with an understanding, however, that it isn't going to be just like the book. When is anything just like the book? Enjoy this for what it is -- a really great movie!!",1132272000,,2047,4.667590027700831

I'm not going to sit here telling you the basis of the movie, because 1.) you probably read the books, and 2.) you NEED to see this movie. So don't miss your chance to see this movie in theaters to get the full effect. And if you can, see it at an IMAX theater.",1132272000,,549,4.092592592592593
2506170,4,B000E6EK3S,"The phenomenal success of J. K. Rowling's series of novels for children about a boy in a school of wizardry has been augmented by the enormous box office grosses of the film adaptations.  Left with the daunting task of maintaining the standards and quality of the previous installments, Director Mike Newell has fashioned in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, a marvelous, visual treat that matches the series' previous highs.

A new year at Hogwarts brings old faces and some new ones as the school for witchcraft and wizardry is primed for great change and a growing threat.  Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) is shaken by a recurring nightmare as the presence of Lord Voldemort looms ominously, and he summons Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) for advice.  Soon a mysterious man, ""Mad Eye' Moody (Brendan Gleeson), arrives to help Harry against the dark forces.  The school is preparing for a special gathering of two other schools to compete in a special Tri-Wizard Tournament, a fierce and dangerous competition in which only one older student from each respective school may enter via the Goblet of Fire.  Harry becomes involved in the competition to the surprise of everyone including himself.  As he and the other students find, the games are immensely formidable with dragons, underwater traps, and an endless maze of hedges.  Meanwhile, Harry, Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) are experiencing the joys and pain of adolescence as the wonders of high school crushes and the anxiety of the school dance wreak havoc.  Even Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) catches the romantic bug.  Mistrust and accusations complicate matters for Harry, and Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) expresses his concerns about the future. Before long, Harry, Ron and Hermione bicker amongst themselves as their friendship is severely tested.  When the tournament concludes, another set of tragic circumstances opens the way for new evil and betrayal.  As the elder wizards (Gambon,  Maggie Smith and Alan Rickman) close ranks to protect the students especially Harry, the future remains uncertain at best.

Ironically, Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral) is the first British director of the series, and, while he had the difficult challenge of continuing the series, he has added some nice wrinkles and touches by delving deeper into the emotional conflicts of these students.  In fact, the maturation and changes these teens must encounter richly add to the already exciting story.  We root for these heroes and feel their discomfort and pain because we have in a sense grown up with them.  As with any Harry Potter storyline, not all the characters are good and, conversely, not all the suspicious ones are bad.  Several plotlines are carried over from the previous films and new ones are primed for future sequels.  Screenwriter Steven Kloves, the keeper of the flame, has done a herculean job of distilling the essence of Rowling's novels into each film thus far.

As always, the trio of young actors, Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint, own these roles, and the thought of replacing any of them due to age concerns was unnecessary.  All three look great as they are now a little older and wiser.  Of course, Gambon, Smith, Rickman, and Coltrane are the old pros who are the constants at Hogwarts.  Ralph Fiennes is perfectly suited for his villainous turn in the startling climax.  Brendan Gleeson does a fine job as the menacing, yet benevolent `Mad Eye' Moody who supposedly watches over Harry during the tournament.  It also seems that the most recent Harry Potter film is becoming quite an international event as the cast of students is even more ethnically diverse than ever before.

As usual, the production values are outstanding with lavish sets and costumes imaginatively photographed by Roger Pratt.  The special effects are quite impressive although nothing that you haven't already seen in the Lord of the Rings trilogy or the Star Wars sextet.  Just the generous details and little touches throughout the film like the animated paintings add to the overall care that still goes into these films.  Make no mistake, this is a lengthy film, but the pacing is good as a large number of scenes are strung back to back to contain as much of the book as possible into roughly two and a half hours.  It feels a bit episodic but never loses sight of the main story and the emotional state of the characters.

There are creepy images and a foreboding atmosphere through much of the film.  This adaptation does contain more risqu scenes such as Harry's bathtub scene or the terrifying menace of Voldemort, in which the tone gets downright mean-spirited.  The students are not so innocent anymore as they curse, and in one climactic scene come face to face with the pain of loss. A PG13 rating signals that the Potter adventures are growing up fast.

It does require that the audience have a background in the series of books or films to fully appreciate the significance of critical events, although the film can stand on its own as pure entertainment and a coming of age.  In some ways Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is a classic bridge episode similar to The Empire Strikes Back.  Not only is it a strong entry in the series with the most open ended finale yet, it proves a good setup for some potentially exciting things to come.  Harry's next adventure can't come soon enough!",1132272000,,5374,4.9377085650723025
2506181,5,B000E6EK3S,"When a SEVEN HUNDRED and THIRTY-FOUR page novel goes to the big screen, you can expect some EDITS, and very likely that some of your favorite moments from the book will be lost due to time, script, and budget constraints. During the planning stages there was talk of ""Goblet"" being so true to the text, that it might be released as a two-part movie (like ""Kill Bill""). But, after ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" was so neatly ""ABRIDGED"" for screen, the idea was later dropped for the one-shot version. Most avid readers understand what to expect when attending a film version of a beloved book, it can never be the same experience that was had during their reading. The best a reader can hope for is that the director's vision is compatible with his or her own. For example, I always kind of see Peter O'Toole as Prof. Dumbledore when I read ""the series,"" but I have NO complaints about either screen portrayals. So with the understanding that we are going to see a film BASED on a book, however closely or loosely adapted, we go to see a vision other than our own, sometimes it's a VISION other than the author's own.

 Director Mike Newell's vision of Harry's fourth year at Hogwarts is as DARK and DANGEROUS as the novel itself earning WB its first PG-13 rating in the history of the HP film franchise.  As the movie teasers tout ""EVERYTHING CHANGES,"" Harry, Hermione and Ron change in their relationships towards the opposite sex and each other. Ron and Harry have a falling out, Ron is hurt by Hermione's attention toward Viktor Krum, Harry is stepping into manhood with ever increasing burdens being placed upon his shoulders, he is inexplicably entered into the Triwizard Tournament leading to life-or-death struggle with Lord VOLDEM*RT. Let's not forget Harry's greatest challenge to date: THE WINTER FORMAL!!! a.k.a. THE YULE BALL!! It gives me goose bumps just typing it.

The novel contains some ready-made MOVIE MOMENTS, that is to say moments with tremendous potential for stunning visuals, like: the Triwizard Tournament, not to mention the film opener, the Quidditch World Cup (which had so much visual potential that it became a video game before the third movie was finished.) But, the Triwizard Tournament provides a neat bookshelf for the story, making this fourth addition to the franchise a much smoother endeavor than the previous releases. The young wizards, including Harry, must undertake 3 challenges or ""tasks"" throughout the school year.

The first task involves Tournament participants or champions get a golden egg from a Dragon's nest, naturally this evolves into an aerial scene, which like Quidditch, proves difficult to affect the prefect balance of special effects to ""make the magic work."" Add to this already cumbersome technical task, the creation of a flying, fire breathing dragon, and even the boldest of writers and directors might flinch. But, not to worry, as you can tell from seeing the trailers alone, THIS SCENE IS BRILLANT!!

Another scene I knew would be a ""magical"" movie moment was the ""second task,"" which takes place underwater. Underwater scenes, especially in the sci-fi, fantasy genres are notoriously expensive and difficult to make, so I was pleased to see Harry's rescue included. And, there was ""no way out"" of the maze scene, which leads directly to Harry's confrontation with the ""real"" HE-WHO-MUST-NOT-BE-NAMED.

A note on the casting: Ralph Fiennes plays the restored Lord VOLDEM*RT, let me say its about time! Although, I wanted Fiennes to play Prof. Lupin, but muggles can't be choosers. But, Fiennes' portrayal of the ""Dark Lord"" is frightening to say the least. The imposing, Ahab-like Prof. ""Mad-eye"" Moody, the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, is played with distinction by Brendan Gleeson (but, why not Patrick Stuart or David Warner?) Another bit of good casting is Stanislav Ianevski, no that's not a new character it's the Bulgarian actor who plays Hermione's Bulgarian Beau Viktor Krum.
The other champions are also fair choices and Michael Gambon has grown on me as Dumbledore.

On music, I must admit to feeling some disappointment at knowledge of JOHN WILLIAMS absence as composer. But, I am glad to report, that some of Williams' style and themes are still apparent in the work of replacement composer Patrick Doyle. Also, Yule Ball songs are provided by the Weird Sisters care of: Jarvis Cocker of PULP and members of RadioHead.

Although a lot of the original scenes and dialog are ""trimmed,"" like SIRIUS' scenes, for instance, which are reduced, the poor HOUSE-ELVES (Hermione would be outraged by the injustice of it!). Still, the overall mood of the novel is captured. It is captured so well that the film merits a  PG-13 rating for frightening images, an implied murder, and the death of a major character. But one bonus of the trimmed down version of the book: there's NO TIME FOR THE DURSLEYS!!!

The Warner Bros. film versions of the Potter series has given its audience the unique opportunity to watch the characters grow up, literally, an opportunity that would have been lost had producers lost their nerve and spread the movies out even more and gone with recasting. I for one am thankful that we have been allowed to continue this journey with Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint and the other Weasleys (Wow! Who'd thought that ""the twins"" could get taller?).

Goblet is without a doubt THE BEST FILM so far IN THE SERIES!

2506182,5,B000E6EK3S,"Well, I really enjoyed the first three movies, so I really hope for this one to be the best of them. But, even though the movies are well done and have very nice special effects, I worry about the most important thing that the movies should have, the story.

The first movie, ""The Sorcere's Stone"", was not only great in a mysterious way, but also in the story way. The second, ""The Chamber of Secrets"" was just as good with the visual effects, but the story was diferent, not that much, but it still changed. With the third movie ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" the story got too different with the book, the movie didn't explain everything, like where did Proffesor Lupin meet Peter Pettigrew, and that upset a few fans. So I truly hope that they make this movie with the story exactly like in the book.

For what I have seen, a few interviews with Emma Watson, Rupert Grint and Daniel Radclife, and the trailer, the movie seems very good, but I guess I will have to wait to see it to make a real opinion.

Another thing that I really want to see is the fight between Harry and Ron, because in the book it is a long, ugly fight, so I hope they make it like that, and not like in the third movie where Harry and Ron were supposed to fight with Hermione and not talk to each other in like a month or so, and in the movie they barely argued.

I hope the movie will be awesome and very well done, and I hope every fan watches the movie even if they don't like them. Thats all I have to say about the 4th movie.",1116633600,,1502,4.151202749140894

They once showed an 'uncut' version on TV of the first Harry Potter movie, and there were many scenes in there which I remembered from the books that were missing.  I'm just wondering when and if they're going to release an ""uncut"" version of the movies.  Maybe then there will be less complaining about the missing parts of the story lines.  I'm sure they're taking their time so that they can juice out every cent out of the public, but it's unfair to the consumers.  Anyway, as with any book, it's impossible to get all the details in, but I do agree that they can definitely do a better job in not only focusing more on some of the main story plots, but more importantly not destroying some of the characters in the movie to make them more 'sociable'..thinking of the centaur who's secretive character they destroyed in the first movie.

I was disapointed they left out the part where Harry out races Malfoy, and all the cool Quiditch stuff. And why was Wood not in this movie? The movie just doesnt make sence when you leave almost all the important parts out. So, if any of the directors are reading this, PLEASE

dont leave too much out of Goblit of Fire... I don't care how long you have to make the movie, trust me, sales will go higher the less stuff you leave out.",1103241600,,717,4.049295774647887

True, the Harry Potter movies that have been released so far are good, but if people liked the first three, they should go review those (or review the books). People cannot just base their reviews on assumptions, and comment on how good or bad a movie is without actually seeing it! I gave this a three star rating, because, well firstly I cannot post this message unless i give a star rating, and secondly, I don't know whether the movie will be good or bad, so I just put an average for it.

2506203,3,B000E6EK3S,"This movie follows Harry through his fourth year at Hogwarts.  It isn't exactly like the book, so don't go into the theater expecting to see Ton Tongue Toffees or lots of the little side plots that weave through the book.  But the gist of the story is well-preserved.  Dan Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint, the three stars of the film, are growing up, and as they grow, they grow into better actors.  Also, be on the watch for Alan Rickman.  As usual, he is excellent as the vile Severus Snape, but his performance is much more meaningful after having read the most recent Potter book.  (Rickman was the first actor from the series to ask J.K.Rowling about his character's future and inner motives, and it shows.)

Also, the music in this film is exquisite.  The first three films' scores were composed by John Williams, and this one was by Patrick Doyle.  Doyle incorporates Williams' themes well, and his music fits seamlessly into the film.

The one thing that I didn't like about the film was that the first part was very jerky and difficult to follow, especially for someone who hasn't read the books.  It is very hard to fit 700 pages into three hours, and the choppiness of the Quiddich World Cup is where this movie suffers the most.

And at romertas pub harry, ron and hermonie all were allowed to go in. and over heard the conversation together. Some say the movie would have been way too long with detail but at least you understand the whole movie, it wouldnt have even been that long anyway it wasn't even 3 hours long like the lord of the rings books.

I for one can't wait for the fourth movie, even though it is sure to be slightly disappointing. The book is so full of plot points, there are sure to be lots of things left out.

Amazing cast. Experienced director. Technology beyond imagination. Not forgetting the excellent story. AND MONEY, MONEY, MONEY...

What else can you ask for a Harry Potter movie?

Year 1 overflew expectations. Everyone loved Daniel Radcliffe as Harry.

Year 2 reached them, was great, but not outstanding. Rupert Grint showed the world his acting tallent as Ron.

Year 3 was short, exciting and fun. Not excellent, but yet worthy beyond recognition. This movie could be called Emma Watson's debuting film as a real magnificent actress. Beautiful, graceful and heart acellerating as a very smart Hermione.

Year 4 can't possibly not be 'excellent' at least.

Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort; no one could be better.

2506223,3,B000E6EK3S,"OK, the third Harry Potter movie was decent.  I went to see it, and I plan on buying the DVD and watching it again, but I think it left out THE ALL TIME MOST IMPORTANT POINT about who exactly Moony, Wormtail, Padfoot, and Prongs were and why.  It brought the map into the movie, yes...but did anyone notice that although Lupin knew it was a map (In the scene where he's rescuing Harry from Snape) Harry didn't ask how he knew???  BIG POINT LEFT OUT RIGHT THERE!!!  And they never came back to it, and they never went into how cool it was that Harry's Patronus was a stag...just like his father's animagi form...UGH!

I was disappointed in that they left all of that storyline out, which I thought was pretty darn important, and instead felt the need to show Harry flying on Buckbeak for what seemed to be a long time.  Yeah, it was cool, but if the movie was time constrained that would have been time better spent developing the more important parts of the story in my opinion.

We finally get a talented director who has somewhat of a vision and everyone complains.  Who cares if some Quidditch was cut, or if the Firebolt was moved to the end?

I'm sure that the Goblet of Fire is going to be as great as the book. I'm not going to use up my 1,000 wording space telling you how long the sequences in the 4th movie are going to be because, let's face it, I don't have time for that and several people have already done that. But there's something people have to understand: movies cost money. I would know, since I'm writing one myself, but all those extra scenes everyone wishes were in the movies (yes, me too) cost millions to make. Film reels, setting, extras, they all cost alot in big-budget movies. If the directors and writers of Harry Potter put all the stuff from the books in the movies, you're looking at a minimum of 3-4 hours in a movie theatre. Now, I agree with everyone else woh say that all of the good stuff was cut out from the movies, I love Harry Potter as much as the next fan, but those extra hours in the movie, costs money. Sometimes a film crew goes over theie budget for a movie, I don't know, but can't you all wait until the director's cut DVD comes out? Think about it.",1089676800,,1230,4.260683760683761

I realize that for time purposes things have to be left out, but Gryffindor winning the Quiddich Cup is NOT something that should be left out. Harry outracing Malfoy for the snitch should NOT be left out!! IT WAS AND THAT IS WHAT I WANTED TO SEE! We only saw one Quiddich match between Ravenclaw and Gryffindor in the rain. We didn't even get a glimpse of Harry's crush Cho. I watched an A&E special where J.K said this movie was truer to the book than the other films were. LIE. Harry gets his Firebolt in the middle of the second book and then proceeds to use it to his advantage against Malfoy. Where is Wood in this movie? In the book when Gryffindor wins the Quiddich Cup there is partying and happiness among all Gryffindors...we don't see this celebration..we don't see Wood, and we don't see enough Quiddich!! What was with Harry getting his firebolt at the end of the movie and then racing off into thw sky?? We don't see how Sirius escapes on Buckbeak or the postcard that Harry gets explaining that he is okay and in hiding.. I was really disappointed with the third movie.

Unless you are the writer, director or Ms. Rowling herself you don't know what is being left out and I can promise everyone that nothing will be left out that is important to telling the story. That is why the first two movies were so long and the next two will be even longer. Ms. Rowling wants the stories told right and they will be. My only fear is that they won't be able to keep all the actors togeather for all seven movies. When the movie finally does come out and people can write reviews on something they have seen, I sure they will all be very positive. For now, be patient.",1084060800,,874,4.177514792899408

  For those of you who have read the books, you all know that the books starts off with Harry having that dream. But the MOVIE starts with Harry AT SCHOOL! This means they completely skip the following scenes in the book: Harry's dream, the Weasleys coming to the Dursleys' house, the Invitation to the Quidditch World Cup, the Weasley Wizard Wheezes, the Burrow, meeting Oliver Wood, Bagman, and Crouch at the campout, the Quidditch World Cup, AND the Dark Mark scene!
  So I suggest if you haven't read the book, you should read it before seeing the movie. Because for those who haven't read it, you are missing out of alot of things if you are going to watch the movie without reading the book first. Especially for those who like Quidditch. Since the Quidditch World Cup scene is cut out, there WILL NOT BE ANY QUIDDITCH SCENES IN THIS MOVIE. In the book the only Quiddutch scene IS the Quidditch World Cup! Unless the director makes a MAJOR change in the movie, you won't be seeing Quidditch in the Goblet of Fire.
  Since Order of the Phoenix (book 5) is even longer than Goblet of Fire, the director will probably make even more changes to the movie just to make it shorter.",1082764800,,1269,4.543859649122807
