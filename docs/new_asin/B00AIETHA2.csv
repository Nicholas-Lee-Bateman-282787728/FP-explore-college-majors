8552159,3,B00AIETHA2,"Like its predecessor, the cast of Lan Kwai Fong 2 seems to have been cloned - the men from Asian fashion magazines and the girls from men's magazines.

The story revolves around clubbers who live it up at Hong Kong's nightlife district. A poor photographer Rain (Kelvin Kwan) falls for a rich girl Summer (Shiga Lin). In a bizarre case, Summer gets drunk and ends up with a miscarriage. To the film's credit, it delves into the couple's financial problems as Summer's father Max (Joey Tang) stops her allowance as he disapproves of Rain. So will there be a reconciliation?

Don (he's a real player) is a blondie who uses pick up lines such as ""2012 is the end of the world, we must do something."" He says he's an USB - as in he sticks it in wherever he is. Don (Sammy Sum) meets the girl Siri (Liu Yuqi) who's phone he accidentally took at the club. In an ironic turn, he tells Siri ""I Love You"" only to have the nympho say she's in it for the sex! The poor Don Juan is heartbroken.

Then there's cute cop Fai (ladies, Dominic Ho looks great in tank tops) who spot checks the clubs regularly and falls for sexy DJ Maxim (Linah Matsuoka). And broker Avis (Avis Chan) develops a protective stance towards club prostitute QQ (Mia) because of the bullying patrons.

The girls and even guys show a lot more skin than the first instalment. And there's still  plenty of public sex - in the park, elevator and even a glass window overlooking the busy street. Well, the vitals are all artfully covered despite the top half nudity. The most risque is a scene with implied fellatio. Some are surprisingly tender.

Cantopop singer Alex  Fong makes a cameo. He spoofs himself as a dead ringer trying to get into the club. DVD extras includes a trailer and a photo gallery of the sex scenes.

Lan Kwai Fong 2 is a little slower than its predecessor. Even though the story is somewhat shaky and there's a really corny ending (everyone moves backwards), I enjoyed the pairing off of the various couples. And I did like it a lot better on the second viewing. So watch it for the beauty and flesh parade. Yup, there's a swimsuit segment and the men do show some buff physiques.
