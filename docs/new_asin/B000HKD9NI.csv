Good bang for the buck as the lessons are long and the cd that acompanies the dvd is full of full length blues backing tracks that you can play along to any time you choose. Plus his personality is easy going and that makes a big difference in the overall enjoyment you get out of learnning from him.

Great teacher & great audio and video = sastifying and fun learnning expierience in my opinion.

I have all 3 in this series and play to them often.
