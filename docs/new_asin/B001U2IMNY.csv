8342655,4,B001U2IMNY,"Hi.  I read the three reviews here and see the frustration in the quality of the dvd-r.  I have this movie on vhs, from a 16mm transfer.  The a/v quality isn't first-rate.  It's not even very good, but the movie is certainly watchable.  I have a few store-bought videos (""The Clairvoyant,"" for example) that aren't as good.  And I have a store-bought dvd of ""King Lear"" with Brian Blessed which is dreadful quality.  I can only guess, but I think that the video I have might be a tad better than the dvd-r here.
I'd like to list this video but can't, since this listing is for a dvd.  Any suggestions?  Thank you.",1299369600,,613,4.353982300884955
8342656,4,B001U2IMNY,",,,,,This movie is interesting because it introduced Dorothy Lamour to movie audiences and along with Hurricane and the Road pictures typecast her forever in a sarong.  Lamour was an unknown when she was cast in the lead role because of her waist lenth brunette hair and her exotic beauty.  It also marked the first major role for Ray Milland who screen tested with Lamour for the part and got the role when she suggested him.  Milland was always grateful to Lamour and said in later years that she was responsible for saving his career.  In his book, ""Wide Eyed in Babylon"", Milland wrote of Lamour, ""a simpler nicer person does not exist"".

.....The plot of a girl raised alone in the jungle with a pet tiger is far fetched by modern standards but this was in an era when Tarzan movies were popular.  The dvd print is sharp but somewhat dark in some scenes with little shading between black and white.  I deducted one star for dvd quality.  The movie is good escapist adventure with a feel good ending and a must have for fans of Dorothy Lamour.",1252800000,4,1047,4.531914893617022
8342657,1,B001U2IMNY,"I live in the U.K. so to acquire this film I had to send for a copy from the USA. This cost me $32.24 here in the U.K. that's 19.83. A lot of money for a single DVD.  Upon arrival, very quick I must say, I played the disc and was very disappointed. There is hardly any definition, sometimes when Dorothy Lamour smiled she looked like a ghoul, just her eyes and teeth showing.  If you want a copy of this film I would suggest looking to see if Paramount ever issued it on VHS. Which it what I shall be doing after typing this review!!",1246924800,5,533,4.018867924528302
8342658,1,B001U2IMNY,"This is a black&white movie. An I literally mean BLACK and WHITE.  No other definition is visible. Nevertheless the original movie itself is good and Lamour is beautiful even without any gray-scales.
But, it is as bad as any copy possibly could be. An old overused 8 mm would be more enoyable watching than this one. Not recommended. Looking for a better copy.",1242691200,3,360,4.714285714285714
