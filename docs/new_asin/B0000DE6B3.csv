8000784,5,B0000DE6B3,"Franco Nero is great in this picture....He doesn't over act at all in this picture as he sometimes has a habit of doing.  He does not go over board in playing a gay character either. He is very cool.  You get the impression that Versace was first a business man, and then a fashion designer who happened to be gay.  Now, if you are expecting some great bedroom love scene between him and his lover, you won't find it here.  Nero's  gay roles have been few and far between, and he  is not about that kind of realism in these roles.  If you didn't get that kind of thing from him in ""Querelle"" with his love interest Brad Davis, you would never get it anywhere else. After all, his most notable role was a romantic pairing in Camelot with Vanessa Redgrave his current wife.  So, no steamy same sex kinds of roles in his long career.  On another note, you do get the impression of what a great loss it was to the fashion world when Versace was murdered.  If you're a Nero fan,  I would suggest that you forget the critics who have panned the movie...see it for yourself.",1384300800,2,1067,4.285
8000785,1,B0000DE6B3,"It's hard to tell what's more appalling, that people would so eagerly cash in on a horrific murder, or that they would do such a rank-ametuer job of it.  The producers rushed this film into production shortly after Cunanan's death, filming it in 22 days for $5 million.  Based on the finished product, it looks like they spent $10 on the screenplay, $90 on the props, $900 on videotape, and $4,999,000 on acting lessons for Shane Perdue.  I don't know how Perdue could be cast in a high-school talent show, let alone a motion picture.  An embarrassed Franco Nero plays Gianni Versace by averting his eyes and sighing his lines, as though hoping no one recognizes him.  Playing a fictional FBI agent leading the investigation, Steven Bauer just goes through the motions with ""where's my paycheck?"" restlessness.  He would have been convincing if he were playing a lawyer for Enron.  Nothing else works, either.  The script provides less insight than a National Enquirer article, the the score could be described as disco elevator music.  There is not one scene, performance, or technical aspect of this film that's worth watching.  This isn't even good opportunism.",1111795200,5,1164,4.953608247422681
8000786,1,B0000DE6B3,"Don't waste your time.
An amateur night at the set, whoever though Shane Perdue (?) was a suitable actor must belong to an extraterrestrial culture. Awfully shot and written, full of loopholes and inaccuracies, even Nero  looks properly embarrassed.
An ""Ambulance chasing"" production a  viewer must avoid at all costs. Ugh.",944092800,,323,5.313725490196078
8000787,2,B0000DE6B3,"THE VERSACE MURDER was originally planned to air as a US made-for-TV movie, but the plan was nixed quite possibly because of the shoddy execution of the film.  While the excellent techno-rock score by ex-Goblin  member Claudio Simonetti and the performance of lead Franco Nero can make  the film watchable for some, the rest of the participants are terrible.  Model-turned-actor Shane Perdue, who plays Cunanan, is embarrassingly  impossible to watch.  Initial reports suggested that director Menahem Golan  was seeking to avoid exploitation, but instead the film seems to be nothing  but.  There seems to be little concern on the part of the filmmakers to  tell the story with class and quality.  Buy the soundtrack CD to obtain the  film's best element and skip the film itself.",939772800,3,780,5.103174603174603
8000788,2,B0000DE6B3,"I feel so bad for Franco Nero. He is such a talented actor and , as always, he is good in this movie. The story is good also, but the real problem is everything else. The other ""actors"" (with the  exception of Steven Bauer) are absolutely pathetic.  I've seen better  acting on an episode of 'Cops'. The direction is far below sub-standard. Ed  Wood would laugh at this. For fans of Nero and bad movies only.",918086400,2,408,4.328947368421052
