8285223,5,B001BXTPOM,"I've watched this biography many times because it's so inspirational.  I love seeing his journey from poverty to an incredible amount of wealth and fame.  It's incredible, too, the number of books he's written that have been turned into movies.  How many authors can say the same?  And yet, he appears to have remained humble throughout, which makes him even more admirable.

What's fascinating to watch is where he got his inspiration for some of his books.  When you watch his life story unfold, it's easy to see where he got his inspiration from even before the narrator tells you.
For example, you're told he lived on a busy street where his son almost got hit by a car. Pet Sematary.  He stayed in an abandoned hotel and almost went stir crazy.  The Shining.  A crazed fan once visited his wife when he wasn't home.  Misery.
Because I love to write fiction, I'm always on the lookout for inspiration, so it's fascinating to know where other writers got their inspiration, too.",1271894400,7,981,4.684210526315789
