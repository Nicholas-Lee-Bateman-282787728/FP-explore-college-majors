Any fan of college football will go nuts for this game.  Of course, it helps to come to this game with the mindset that OU is supposed to kill Boise State (though I am not sure why--OU, like UT, was very inconsistent and not very good this year).

There are all sorts of mind-boggling plays and just out-and-out fun!  I stayed up way past my bedtime (had to get up at 0500 the next day) to watch this one end.  :)",1168387200,2,570,4.053571428571429
2711248,5,B000LP5D7O,"When it's June and you're really going through football withdrawal this will do the trick. I have been a college football junkie for a few decades and this was something very special. I can't wait to see the magic again. The game, every facet of it, was what makes college football so special. I can't remember ever having that much fun watching a game before. There were better games sure. More important games? Definitely. But for pure entertainment Hollywood couldn't have written a better script.",1168300800,5,500,4.894117647058824

2711265,5,B000LP5D7O,"Look, if you are already on this page, chances are you have seen this game or heard someone talk about it.  There is no hyperbole when it comes to this game.  It really is one of the greatest college football games ever.  Boise State was an upstart WAC team that nobody respected going against Oklahama, one of the nation's most storied schools.  The drama is unbelievable and couldn't be better if it was scripted.  The teams trade punches back and forth, snagging victory from defeat in turn until you can't believe what is happening on the screen.  I've never bought a college football game for antiquity before, but I had to own this one.",1396137600,2,642,4.587719298245614

I happened to be channel surfing and for some reason stopped on the 2007 Tostitos Fiesta Bowl-BSU Broncos/OK Sooners game. OMG! WHAT AN ENDING! The Universe must have been shining on me to witness this game!  After all this time I still think about how I jumped out of my chair, clapping, shouting and cheering at the end!  Now (9/2013) am sending the DVD to friends in San Jose.  FABULOUS GAME ENDING!!  Can't imagine there being any better!",1379116800,2,528,4.695652173913044

2711288,5,B000LP5D7O,"Prior to this game, my interest in college football was rapidly declining to the point that I didn't care anymore about it. When the matchups were announced for BCS bowl games including the other bowl games, as soon as I saw the pairing ups of (the most hated and detested mostly by me) Oklahoma and Boise State, I knew that Boise State got shafted for two reasons. Although they were the only undefeated team of all college football, it was a small school, and nobody cares about them, hence low TV ratings. Moreover, Oklahoma Sooners shouldn't have been in that game at all in the first place because it was the most overrated football team of that year (and every year before and after that too because the voters of the polls have always been supporters of that team, so it's pretty clear to see the bias). Anyway, showing absolutely no interest in watching any of the (toilet) bowl games including the three trash BCS games and the so-called ""national championship"" game, I found Boise State-Oklahoma game the most intriguing of any, probably of all time. First reason, this kind of game never ever happens in the post-season. Second reason, I knew Boise State would win this one, but rather, I was quite interested in the aftermath of the game. Third reason, it was a statement game of small school versus big school much in the lines of 1954 Indiana State High School Basketball Championship. In short, it was the most non-anticipated anticipated football game in a lifetime. Why did I say that? Honestly, every single so-called expert on ESPN and elsewhere had routinely picked Oklahoma to win the game and in a huge way. And also, nobody actually planned on watching the game because everybody wanted to see Ohio State/Florida game. Everybody thought this was going to be a bad blow-out because of the total mismatch between Boise State and Oklahoma. To me, I thought that was the best match-up ever because I knew Boise State was going to beat this ""Mighty"" Sooners team with a storied history of college football. I wanted so badly to see them beat and find out what happens after that.
Finally, the game had arrived. The heavily favored Oklahoma seemed to have taken the game lightly, so thus, Boise State took a huge lead of 28 to 10 after three quarters. Then suddenly, Oklahoma made a fiery comeback and tied the game up at 28-28. Then they finally took the first lead of the night in the 4th quarter after that game-ending interception for touchdown with about one minute left in the game. Pretty much at this point, it became a resigned fact to every viewer that the game was over. So, everybody went to sleep. But nooo...not me...I actually stayed on and watched the game more. I had this weird feeling that this was not over, far from that. I remember looking at everybody on the Boise State squad that they just knew this game wasn't over at all. In fact, they thought the whole time that they will win the game. In my mind, I just knew that something special was going to happen. After that pick six and the offense took over the field again, I remember that nothing was happening for three downs. Finally, fourth down came with 18 yards left and 18 seconds to go. As the play was snapped and the ball was caught, there was a feeling of ""over"" by the looks of it until the miracle happened: a hook and ladder play which became singularly the greatest play of college football besides that Cal-Stanford one, of course. As soon as I saw it happened, I was the most ecstatic I've been as I saw it unfolding...it was just the greatest play I've seen. Somehow, Boise State made the improbable comeback in the end of 4th quarter in a very stunning fashion. No word can ever describe how I felt at that moment; this was actually being done at live TV with the feeling by everybody shared all alike that Oklahoma had already won the game. The mighty Broncos showed the guts and courage to do something different and innovative at a critical time. Finally, overtime came. Of course, Oklahoma scored a touchdown and got the PAT. Obviously, the momentum was clearly in its favor, and Boise State had no defense for that offense. Once again, Boise State found themselves in a hole that they had to climb out. I remember looking at how slow but surely their offense was trying to tie the game up during overtime. At the third down with a yard to go near the goal line, Boise State did some weird shuffling around of the players; there was a feeling of being ""overwhelmed"" because this was the Oklahoma Sooners they were facing against, a team with absolute storied history of College Football. Then, the ball was snapped, and the play was a fail. Even I thought the game was over because of a fumble but not so. Finally, fourth down came, and it was a moment of truth. In my mind, I just couldn't really see it happening, and every time I would have loved a team to overcome the odds, eventually I get really disappointed in the end. I greatly feared at that moment this would be the case. I remember how seemingly calm Chris Petersen, the coach of Boise State, was about the whole thing, and that spoke volumes to me. I remember how back forth the camera was on the coach of Oklahoma, on Chris Petersen, on the fans of Boise State, and on the fans of Oklahoma as well as the players of both sides. It was a moment of great uncertainty: one side already had the victory and the other side an inevitable defeat but not ready to die yet. Finally the fourth down play came...more weird shuffling around by the offense ...jeez, what is the quarterback doing out of the place?...then HE JUST RAN TO THE LEFT SIDE...the anxiety of the moment and the looming dreadfulness...finally the ball snapped...by a different player other than Jared Zabransky...right side run...looking like game  over to me...everybody all covered...finally thrown as Derek Schoumann somehow got free and made an incredible grab for touchdown. Boise State does the impossible again. At that moment, I was thinking, ""Can this really go on longer? Can Boise State keep up with Oklahoma all night in more overtimes?"" Then, my answer came: nope...Boise State have decided to go for the win...I knew...it just had to happen right there and now. This really about a small school dueling it out with a storied program like Oklahoma. They got this far, and it's time for another moment of truth. It was also shocking at that time because this was truly a call of guts...at a critical time. How many coaches will do this at the moment of death? Of course, Chris Petersen would do it....they've done it all season...they've been unique...they have been innovative. They are just unlike any team in college football at that year and before. Finally, the players lined up on the line of scrimmage for the two point conversion. I was thinking at that point, `I can't believe they are doing it...I hope they can do it. I don't know how can this work."" Then Stoops called for a timeout and wanted to assess the plan for defense for the upcoming 2 point conversion. I didn't think anyone expected that either. At that point, there was an incredible amount of uneasiness among everybody in the stands. And they kept showing the video of Adrian Peterson, the mighty Sooner of all Sooners of Oklahoma. I knew at that moment, FOX channel and everybody else alike just wanted Oklahoma to win, period. Finally, the play is underway. Then, somehow, it looked like a play gone dead. A lot of stalled motion...yet somehow, Boise State just won the game!!!!!! How how how?????? Nobody saw what happened...nobody realized what happened...nobody comprehended a single thing about it. BOISE STATE JUST WON THE GAME AND BEAT THE OKLAHOMA SOONERS IN AN IMPROBABLE FASHION. I couldn't believe what I saw. Soon after the game was over, Jared Zabransky was being momentarily interviewed....and he just had this to say (I don't remember exactly what he said, but it was something like that.), ""I think you may have just saw the greatest game ever in college football history."" Indeed, it was...not only that, that game was the greatest football game ever I've seen in my life. One final thing to add before I write that, I was waiting longer to watch more of the celebrations, and I wanted to see it in entirety to the end. Somehow, something incredible just happened. Ian Johnson did something at the spur of the moment and got down on his knee after being interviewed. Then, he asked the cheerleader to marry him. She said...yes! Well....putting it all together, that was the GREATEST FOOTBALL GAME IN THE HISTORY OF ALL TIME. This is coming from me who've seen a lot of games on television over the years: the Joe Montana comebacks including the great one of 1989 Super Bowl and Denver Broncos-Kansas City Chiefs Monday Night thriller, Giants Bills Super Bowl (that'll go down as the greatest Super Bowl ever), Bills Oilers playoff game of 1993, Tennessee Titans Buffalo Bills of 2000, New Orleans Saints Jacksonville of 2003 (I still remember jumping up and down hard on that incredible play and then hitting my hand to the ceiling after Carney PAT miss; too much up and down for me all in so many seconds), St. Louis Rams New England Patriots Super Bowl, Texas A and M Notre Dame Cotton Bowl of 1994, USC Notre Dame of 2005, and Nebraska Miami 1995 Orange Bowl. Watching that 2007 Fiesta Bowl, my mind was just literally blown away. Finally, the next day would signal the death of college football for me. If I had saw the greatest game ever played, how can any future game would ever compare? I just knew it was over for me. Also, there were a myriad of reasons why college football just died that night. I will list them all:
1. ESPN ruined it all. Everybody of that channel dismissed the game as a fluke win. In fact, nobody really cared if Boise State won, and they pretended to be of ""I told you so"" mentality that Boise State shouldn't have been taken lightly even though for weeks prior to that game, they've been on the bandwagon, declaring that Oklahoma would beat the daylights out of the Broncos.
2. Nobody took Boise State seriously at all after that win. It was just a simple pat in the back, and a saying, ""Nice game...but you got lucky."" Nobody viewed them as a National Champion that year even through they were the only undefeated team of all college football.
3. The game became talked about as the game that everybody really saw when in fact nobody but a handful few including me actually saw it on television. Later, it was revealed that the game was the most least watched game of all BCS games in the history. I could easily tell who did see it and who did not because they did not have the real emotions that I really felt during that incredible ending. It was just all pretended by them.
4. The game did not give any new respect to small schools thereafter when it comes to national championship game.
5. The game did not kill the BCS system.
6. Speaking of national championship of Division 1 college football, there has never been, to this date, a real national champion. Nobody in the history of Division 1 college football has ever won a national championship. Rather, every winner of the so called national championship was actually voted as one through popularity contest.
7. Following that same argument, Boise State wasn't viewed as a popular football team, so thus, they weren't declared as the winner of it despite the fact they were the ONLY UNDEFEATED TEAM OF ALL COLLEGE FOOTBALL of that year, and they BEAT THE OKLAHOMA SOONERS in a convincing fashion.
8. Worst of all, nobody took the game seriously and classified it as the GREATEST GAME EVER PLAYED OF ALL TIME IN FOOTBALL HISTORY. I knew it was simply the greatest game every played, and there is no discussion about it.
9. The politics of college football, especially in favor of big schools, have at that time, and still do to this day, sickened me greatly. Nobody seems to realize that an undefeated team doesn't mean it's an outright winner of the national championship...you need to pay attention more to the results of New England New York Super Bowl. It basically says, ""ON ANY GIVEN SUNDAY.""
10.  Finally, we need to realize and accept the fact that universities are not created for the livelihood of college football. They should be purely about academics and the enrichment of education for future contributors to society. It is very sad and appalling to me that college football, along with college basketball, have taken the highest priority among big time, and more surprisingly small time, programs. Quite often, college football players and coaches have been linked with academic cheating, illegal benefits, shady recruiting, transgressions of law, lenient punishment and blatant violation of ethics and morals.
Moreover, I don't want to, in some 25 years or so later from now, be a victim of a special where some program on either ABC or ESPN will anoint 2007 Tostitos Fiesta Bowl as the greatest game ever played. I don't even want to be part of the audience by an accident through flipping of the channels. After writing all of that, I'm done with watching college football for good. And I don't need to buy the dvd of 2007 Tostitos Fiesta Bowl because I actually saw the game and will never forget it as long as I live. All in all, I am glad the little guy won.",1290729600,,13318,4.645188639253921

The DVD is very well done and plays fast since there are no commercials.

2711306,4,B000LP5D7O,"In a rebuilding year, Oklahoma had nothing to gain by beating a Boise State team that had nothing to lose. Boise was undefeated while Oklahoma had wide receiver Paul Thompson at quarterback and a still injured Adrian Peterson at running back.  Regardless, in what was predicted to be a down  year for the Sooners they managed to win the Big XII championship and make it to the Fiesta Bowl. To declare this a Boise State game against ""mighty Oklahoma"" does not recognize that Boise played Oklahoma in one of only two years that it could even compete with the Sooners over the last decade. Had the Boise State team played in a major conference with the bumps and bruises caused by such a schedule and perhaps a championship game, Boise would have had multiple losses prior to the bowl season and would have been in a bowl game somewhere less sunny than Glendale, AZ. The surprise of this game was that in a down year that Oklahoma was behind by so many points and came back to lead undefeated Boise in the fourth quarter.",1198886400,,1019,4.532608695652174

This game is like a great movie where you know the ending yet you still find yourself on the edge of your seat every time you watch it.  Boise State dominated the game and was doing a good job of controlling the ball and burning time as they cruised to victory...or did they?  Oklahoma found a way to pull it out...or did they?  Boise State had surely been handed a gut-wrenching loss...or had they?  Oklahoma got down to business immediately in overtime, finally restoring order to the galaxy.  Or did they?

Like everyone says, a great game that every college football fan should at least watch if not own(even if you're not a fan of either team).  The 4th qtr and overtime are arguably worth the asking price by itself(great comebacks by both teams!).  Fortunately though, you get the entire game plus a few extras.

""Bonus Features"" include:

* post game- celebration, interviews, marriage proposal, and trophy presentation.  (not sure why this is in the bonus section instead of just letting it play out after the game was done though)

* short cuts- condensed version of the fox broadcast.  for those who want the cliff notes on the game.

* player profiles- just a pictorial roster line-up of each team.

* fight song- Boise State's fight song sing-along(lyrics provided).

* in the trenches- ""great plays from 'in the trenches' during BS's/OU's 2006 seasons"".

* radio edit- ""game highlights with the hometown radio calls""

Overall, a quality release; and it visually looks better than last year's USC vs Texas Rose Bowl dvd(see people's reviews for that release).  But both games come highly recommended.  This will help tide you over till the 2007 season starts up(i miss college football already).",1172620800,17,1258,4.980769230769231

2711341,5,B000LP5D7O,"I didn't have a dog in this hunt, and caught only the fourth quarter live, as we spent the afternoon watching our beloved Blue ignobly fall to Pete Carroll and the Trojans. We had escaped the jammed-up streets surrounding the Rose Bowl and were headed toward the freeway when I heard excited announcers on the radio proclaiming that Boise State led mighty Oklahoma, 14-0! I knew then that I had to get the game video.
  When I asked around, none of my friends or their other friends or any acquaintances anyone knew at all, had t-vo'ed this game.
  So I ordered it and waited about five weeks until Fox put it into general release.  It was worth the wait!  This game is spellbinding from start to finish; it has everything college football fans live for and crave to see.  Watching the game will delight underdogs, and fans of underdogs, for decades to come.
  Turns out, you see, there IS parity in the NCAA, and here in the intermountain west, we can play some football!
  This video is a keeper, one for the ages, not to be missed.",1171756800,8,1034,4.475935828877005

My computer meets the requirements and I tried to follow some advice under the help section of their website.  I am going to just buy the DVD.

As for rating the quality of the game...it is an easy 5.0 out of 5.0 in my book.  It was the best sporting event I had ever witnessed.  What a game!  I can't imagine a better 4th quarter/overtime.",1171152000,2,492,4.11578947368421

2711345,5,B000LP5D7O,"I am a football nut and this game was by far the best bowl game I have ever witnessed in my forty something years on this planet.  Certainly it was one of the best I have ever seen.  Many people saw this already legendary game with the insanely wild ride for the last two minutes, but far more of you missed it thinking it would be a route by Oklahoma.  Here is your chance to indulge in this highly entertaining game in its entirety.  I believe this will be one of those games I will want to watch every few years just to remember how great this past football season has really been on every level.",1168992000,14,599,4.137931034482759

The agreement says no refunds if you're unable to watch the game because your system doesn't meet requirements.  Buyer beware.  Customer service for a million plus downloads probably isn't going to be that great.  Most people will write off the $2.99 rather than demand service.

P.S.  Download time for a 3.54GB file at 180KBPS is just under six hours. :o)",1168819200,4,518,4.885057471264368
2711347,5,B000LP5D7O,I just downloaded and watched this game and I'm glad it was here on Amazon. The shortened version was really different and enjoying to watch (plus it was about the cost of a lotto ticket ;)) and the game was very good. Cool plays that I don't see utilized enough and an underdog victory was really awesome. Recommended!,1168560000,8,319,4.517241379310345
2711348,5,B000LP5D7O,"I am LONGHORN through and through.  My son, 2 years old, my wife, and I bleed burnt orange.  (Well the wife has some Arkansas Razorback red in there too)  Anyway, we are TEXAS fans with a capital T.  I love TEXAS and as a real fan love to see OU get taken down a notch or 10.  I also love the underdog, which Boise State was.  Boise State did what everyone wanted them to do, but what most didn't think they could do.  The came from a small, underappreciated conference and beat a big name program in a big name BCS bowl game.  It could have been easy for Boise State to lose their momentum after OU pulled ahead, however, they didn't.  They played with precision, with poise, and with passion.  This game is worth watch anytime you want to see a great dual David vs. Goliath.  I still say the 2006 Rose Bowl (TEXAS and USC) was the greatest game cause my boys showed everyone that the BIG 12 and TEXAS and VINCE YOUNG and MAC BROWN are national contenders.  This Boise State/OU game is almost as great.  Very exciting.  I love it and will watch it for years to come.",1168560000,4,1067,4.217821782178218

Without commercial interruption, this is the complete FOX telecast of the 2007 FIESTA BOWL with the exception of halftime. This is not a BLU-RAY people so this is not presented in high definition. It is, however, an excellent quality dvd. All those who took part in making this game a commercial release have done a wonderful job.
