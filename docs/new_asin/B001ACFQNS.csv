3446643,5,B001ACFQNS,"This show was beaten by Moonlighting(Bruce Willis,Cybill Shephard) in the ratings ,But there are great episodes in this 3 year show. One of the 3 investigators was the brain of the operation and had a robot computer,the other 2 were leading the charge to solve crimes by using a Hot corvette,a helicopter ,and a fast boat. set on the California coast in pier 56,you get a new crime to solve each week. See a trio of California crime fighters in a series backed up by great background music and a producer. This show was cancelled before its time. If it had to compete against the last year of Moonlighting,It would have won and stayed on TV.",1267315200,16,641,4.5344827586206895
3446644,5,B001ACFQNS,"""Riptide"" is my all-time favorite detective show.  So glad it's finally been released on DVD.  This show (from the creators of such gems as ""The Greatest American Hero"", ""The A-Team"" & ""The Rockford Files""), has the perfect blend of comedy & action.  Thom Bray makes the show as the like-able Murray Bozinski.  The show really hit it's stride in season two.  June Chadwick as Lt. Parisi was a nice addition to season three.  This show was highly under-rated, and should have lasted much longer.  The only thing missing is extra features.  It would have been nice to see interviews with the cast & creators of the show...and maybe some behind the scenes features, gags & bloopers.  Still...I highly recomend this series to anyone who likes great classic TV shows.  For the most part, it's fun for the whole family. They don't make shows like this anymore!",1260921600,23,854,4.787671232876712
3446645,5,B001ACFQNS,This series was very popular during my childhood.  This was when tv was decent and suitable for families to watch together.  I highly reccomend this to anyone who wants to take a walk down memory lane to a time when tv was enjoyable to watch!,1250640000,4,242,4.355555555555555
3446646,4,B001ACFQNS,"Unlike most idiots who write amazon reviews, I'm not here to rave about how Riptide could be my ""favoritist show ever"" or ""the coolest show when I was a kid"" or something equally worthless.  Riptide is not my favorite show nor have I seen it since I was a kid.  However, a 2.5 season mid-'80s detective action comedy is not without its charm, and is begging to be revisited.  If you're checking out this page, you're already interested in the show and want to know ABOUT THE DVDS, PERIOD.  So here goes: The set is presented in three amaray DVD cases (one for each season).  The artwork on the cases is identical to the individual season sets and enclosed in a thin cardboard slipcase with cover artwork seen on this amazon page.  My slipcase arrived with some dents but still looks nice on my shelf between The Ring Two and Road to Perdition.  If I ever change my mind, I can ditch the slipcase and the amarays still look really nice on their own, side-by-side.  This is the better buy over the season sets, because you're not losing anything and you're saving space.  Don't worry about the DVDs themselves: I surmise they're the same ones from the season sets (yes, the 5 discs each for seasons 2 and 3 do fit nicely into one amaray).  I threw in the first couple of discs and thought the image was very nice -- about as nice as you can expect for a 25 year-old show.  The only reason I'm not giving the set 5 stars is for some unforeseen irregularity I may encounter as I watch it.  No extras here, which is negligible for a forgotten ""gem"" which can be purchased in its entirety.  Who needs extras? -- This is an entire TV series to watch at your leisure.  NICE WORK, VEI!",1247788800,18,1676,4.364516129032258
3446647,5,B001ACFQNS,"I am proud to say that I am a product of the 80's.  I had the pleasure of growing up watching Riptide when it actually aired on prime time television.  This show, in addition to Hardcastle and McCormick, A-Team, and Knight Rider were shows I looked forward to every week.  I couldn't wait to tune in and find out what crazy case Nick, Cody, and Murray (Boz) would take on next.  The charisma, synergy, and energy brought to their characters provided for excellent chemistry from the first episode to the last.  I really felt like these three were ""brothers"" and I definitely enjoyed watching them work together for a few seasons.  I purchased the complete series on DVD when I found it on Amazon and am definitely glad I did.  I have watched this series twice now and continue to enjoy it.  If you are on the fence over this then let me assure you this series still holds up some 30 years after it originally aired.  Sure, there is some 80's cheese sprinkled throughout it and things like big hair and fashion are laughable at times, but the series is still every bit as fun to watch now as it was three decades ago.",1458691200,4,1116,4.404878048780488

Just like in Simon & Simon, this series sometimes doesn't take itself too seriously! There's a good combination of action
and humor thrown in for good measure! This is a very fun show! The three main characters blend together really well and they seem like they really could have been good friends!

3446654,5,B001ACFQNS,"The Screaming Mimi rides again. Just like 21 Jumpstreet, they have removed the original music from the episodes. That sucks!!!! Thom Bray, Joe Penny, and Perry King were great together and this show was highly underrated. The late Stephen Cannell owned television in the 70's(Rockford) throughout the 80s and into the 90s w/Renegade. Riptide brings back so many memories. Tuesday nights on NBC used to rock w/this and the A-Team. Murray used to tickle me how he would throw a punch w/his thumb inside the fist instead of being out. I saw a pic of the three stars from '10 and Penny who was the youngest looked older than Perry and Thom.",1405555200,,636,4.6875

3446660,1,B001ACFQNS,My decision not to order this set is based on the fact that the original music is not present. The Christmas episode without War is Over would not retain the deep emotional impact that this music set.,1390089600,6,200,4.4324324324324325
3446661,3,B001ACFQNS,"This complete series set of RIPTIDE will not have the description on the side and front of the case as these are officially released and are packed in such a way.

Created by Stephen J. Cannell, the mastermind behind the classics The Rockford Files and Adam-12
 A prime-time TV hit on the NBC television in the mid-80's
 Appeals to fans of similar themed shows of the era like Magnum P.I., Moonlighting and The A-Team
 Features renowned guest stars such as George Clooney, Kelly Preston, Geena Davis and Dennis Franz.

This detective drama also takes me back to memory lane to when it debuted on NBC in the Winter of 1984 and was shown every Tuesday night at 9PM right after THE A-TEAM at 8PM and REMINGTON STEELE at 10PM, despite the fact that RIPTIDE flopped after only 2 1/2 years before it was shown in reruns on USA in the Fall of 1986 after NBC cancelled it in the Spring of 1986, due to weak ratings.",1389571200,,907,4.4397590361445785

3446665,5,B001ACFQNS,These are fantastic - loved the 80's technology with the RoBoz and the geeky Boz character - also I had a Vette (minus the flamed paint job) just like the one they drive. Another plus is I have two grand sons named Nick and Cody. The DVD cases are top notch and the DVD graphics also top of the line. Highly recommend the set - well worth the money.

3446666,5,B001ACFQNS,"It's a trip back in time to an era when a show about 3 detectives was simultaneously humorous and suspenseful, when an on-screen murder left you thinking ""who done it"" without the language and violence prevalent in today's TV shows.  The chase scenes are as fun to watch now as they were nearly 30 years ago.  And Riptide aired back in the day when you could actually read the credits (the list of guest stars is impressive) and enjoy the outtakes at the end, just as it was shown on TV, minus the commercials.

The 3 main characters, Cody Allen (actor, Perry King), Nick Ryder (actor, Joe Penny), and Murray Bozinsky (actor, Thom Bray) were with the show through its full 3-year run.  It's easy to forget that's Perry, Joe and Tom as you are drawn into the world of P.I.'s Cody, Nick and Murray and the camaraderie the 3 shared.  And for those who remember the troublesome Detective Quinlan (actor, Jack Ging)...watching the full 3-years of the series in a matter of a few months makes it obvious how much the Detective grew to respect and trust the 3 private eyes that always seemed to land in the middle of his cases. And it wouldn't be Riptide without the coughing, smoke-spewing pink Screaming Mimi carrying the gang into or out of trouble while the pilot, Nick, crossed himself in hopes she'd get airborne one more time.

This collection has top notch quality of picture, audio and even in the presentation of the package.  It is easy to house, taking up little space at 1 3/4"" thickness, 5 1/2"" wide and  7 1/2"" tall for the box containing 3 DVD holders - 1 for each season - with the multiple DVD's per season.

Buying ""Riptide: The Complete Series"" is money well spent, bringing many relaxing evenings.  A quality show like this is timeless, with the only obvious dating being some of the clothing styles of the 1980's.",1376092800,13,1828,4.562691131498471
3446667,5,B001ACFQNS,This is great of those years of fun tv. The Boz is very funny as the nerdy partner of two detectives. It is light hearted with a few splashes of humor thrown it. I thoroughly enjoyed every episode.,1373068800,3,197,4.2105263157894735

Revision December 31 2014:  Ok still absolutely love the show but just watched the Christmas episode with James Whitmore that was amazing acting... Why did they change the song at the end?... Hello it should have been the Beatles song or John Lennon... I don't which was the exact artist but it should have been the ""So this is Christmas..."" Song.... I'm so bummed because that added to the emotions!  Geez you don't change the song.... Whatever was playing? It was a good song but not THAT song.... What a way to ring in the New Year, oh well",1356912000,2,780,4.51063829787234
3446671,5,B001ACFQNS,"I thought this was a decent collection of episodes for the entire series for what amazon was selling this item for and I felt it was fair price for this collection of the TV series on Standard DVD..
However I miss having the Closed Captioned English subtitles option which should be
Included with All Movie and TV Show released on standard DVD or Blu-Ray. If term Closed Captioned is a copy righted name , them just refer to them as English Subtitles and add this feature regardless.
To bad digital remastering can't be a standard feature for all Movies and TV shows
Released on Standard DVD format as well.
I have not had a chance to watch all the episodes yet, however I liked the episodes I have seen so far.
I would recommend this Entire series DVD
Box set to any Diehard Ripe Tide fan, you won't be disappointed.
It's nice to be able to revisit classic 1980's TV on DVD, these shows. Are much more fun to watch and do not include negative storylines in all their eposodes unlike
Today's cop shows do.
They just don't make them like they used to, the writing was clever and the dialog believable and sometime fun to listen to.",1356480000,7,1130,4.4375
3446672,5,B001ACFQNS,"I was a fan of Riptide in the '80s and enjoyed it very much. I am glad that I got the complete series and am able to enjoy the show again. This is one of those shows where you can lose yourself for an hour with a fast-paced, action filled adventure. The comraderie between the characters is nice to see and the stories are cool. This is one series which does not take iteself too seriously and actually that is a good thing in that it allows you to enjoy the show, laugh and feel good. I liked the show when I saw it in the '80s and still like the show now. I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys detective shows.",1352332800,2,626,4.056451612903226
3446673,3,B001ACFQNS,"Great Quality for an old series but I noticed The original songs are missing once again Be True to Your School,Merry Christmas the wars over and Boz Busters. What was really stupid in the season 2 case they talk about the song Boz Busters and It's not on the DVD The song that replaced Boz Busters sounds way to modern for an 80s show. Why didn't they loop the riptide intro theme over instead putting a dumb song in.",1346025600,11,417,4.291139240506329

8276624,5,B001ACFQNS,"I purchased much cheaper from amazon Canada all VEI disks which appararently so are these.  So far I have watched all of season 1 on my blu ray player, 4K tv and the sound and picture have been fantastic.  No skipping or any issues.  Although just like any of today's broadcasts some of the music (opening) is louder than speaking.  I can't vouch for anyone playing on lesser machines, or on the other seasons that I haven't currently watched.

I recommend anyone double check the costs from Amazon Canada (you just use your same login and password, and it is dot ca instead of com for anyone who is not aware) before purchasing any of the older tv shows, you never know when they will be cheaper...of course newer shows too - I got the idea when I was about to buy Forever and found out it was DVD-R from US, and ""real"" from Canada...and CHEAPER!!  As of this date:  Riptide complete series 40.60 Canadian,  85.55 US both VEI entertainment.  For reference, since I mentioned Forever:  42.99 US (on DVD-R), 29.97 Canadian (Studio which means subtitle capability, etc)

VEI includes 'Facts & Trivia' printed on the inside cover of all the cases.
Season 1 'bonus' material is the season 1, 11th episode of the 80s show Street Justice, starting Carl Weathers (best known as Apollo Creed)
No other bonus material.",1465084800,,1309,4.647826086956521
