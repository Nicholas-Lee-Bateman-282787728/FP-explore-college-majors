But this movie had alot of heart, the teacher had to over come alot of demons in his life. He has lost his wife, lost his prize student in the competion along with his confidents. The teacher in this movie over came all those obsticles and got his confidents back and took revenge for his student. Some people complained about this was a Blood sport rip off lol... well kind of true in a way, but Blood sport was based on true events on the life of the real fighter frank w. dux one of my heroes. Blood fight had there own story, and it was about a retierd kung fu fighter that wanted to pass his teachings to a good student. The fact that the first student he tried to take on turns out to be a loser, so he found another one and he tought him well. Its getting close to the turnament and his girlfriend don't want him to fight but he has made up his mind he wants to fight. Sad news that he loses his life, the teacher feel very guilty so he takes revenge. People should not get to upset that this movie was not up to there standards because you cannot please everybody, just go along for the ride. Besides who watches these films for the plot now come on lol. The fight scenes in this film was awsome, you think the final scene in midnight angels was brutal check the final fight in Blood fight.. I bought my copy of blood fight for 1.00 at the dollar tree so I see why you are upset lmao.. you could have bought a burger in fries for 3 bucks.",1322870400,,1543,4.062295081967213

The broken English of every one of the actors was actually a blessing in disguise because the dialogue was far worse in comparison. I would say watch this movie only if you REALLY want to.",1294358400,,359,4.538461538461538
