8209902,5,B0002YC5TS,"Whigfield doesn't get played on the video channels here in America,((the ones that actually PLAY videos anymore)) so what a great surprise that Was A Time dvd is released in US/Canadian format!  The description, what very little there is of one, says 1 disc, but the copy I got had 2 discs, the dvd and the Was A Time CD!! (Whigfield 4 + ""Was A Time"") Great surprise, even though I have Whigfield 4 and the ""Was A Time"" cd single.

This is a GREAT deal for the dvd AND cd!!  Get yours today!",1160611200,,491,4.202127659574468
