8760817,3,B01FIAXKD0,It was ok. Very slow moving. Kept you wondering right up to the ending credits. What the heck?,1529452800,,94,4.277777777777778
8760818,5,B01FIAXKD0,Great movie! It grabs you from the moment you push play. My husband and I ordered it because it was filmed in Montana and has won numerous awards. It did not disappoint. The film does feature beautiful scenery but more than that takes you on a suspenseful journey that keeps you riveted to the end.,1481328000,5,298,4.4363636363636365
8760819,5,B01FIAXKD0,"I bought this because it was filmed in my home town, but I quickly got lost in the story and the characters and failed to even notice the landmarks of my own city. I like independent films because they require a bit more thought on the viewers part to follow the story and I felt like I was solving the puzzle along with the protagonist.  Others may have felt the film was hard to follow, but I feel that the confusion was intentional to better help the viewer see through the eyes of the main character who was thrust into an entirely new world with no reference points of his own.
For some reason the film had a very British feel to me, despite being filmed in Montana. I'm not sure if this was a nod to the band IQ, or just my own perception based on other independent films I've seen.
Overall, a great independent film!",1478995200,4,823,4.24203821656051
8760820,4,B01FIAXKD0,"Thought this was a great thriller. Had a sci-fi feel but wasn't actually a science fiction film per se. LOVED: Cinematography, editing and the performances (Nick Turturro looked like he was having fun playing this character). DISLIKES: It was a little long and talky. While the editing was good, they could have cut the running time down and increase the pace. Overall, worth a blind purchase or at least a rental. Pretty great for an independent film.",1478649600,6,452,4.883116883116883
8760821,1,B01FIAXKD0,"An absolute disappointment. As a long time fan of the IQ album this was supposedly based on, I was quite put off. A disjointed and needlessly abstract attempt. Predictable and jumpy. The ""plot"" flies from one thing to another. It takes no time at all to figure out that everyone aside from the main character are in it together. And when the ending comes, there is zero surprise. Maybe this was a good art school project, or fan film. But, it's really not worth the hour and a half of your life that you won't get back. Avoid.",1477785600,5,526,4.377551020408164
