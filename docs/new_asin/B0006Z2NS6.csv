2197243,4,B0006Z2NS6,"This is mainly a contents listing of 5 box sets of film-noir collections. Quality is excellent for the Warner box--the films are not public domain and were remastered. The four other collections are of public-domain films, some of which were fixed up somewhat. Film quality is variable (dropouts, scratches, cropped images, fuzziness, low contrast). Most films are quite watchable, and there are some very good versions, especially if low price is considered (e.g., Hitch-hiker--only on CLA9). However, there are some marginal issues (e.g., Red house--only on FN10) and some extremely bad issues (e.g., Man who cheated himself--only on CLA9).

2197244,4,B0006Z2NS6,"Other reviews will break these DVDs down film-by-film, and no reviewer can honestly compete with the fine job done bt ace reviewer Forehand in that regard. What I want to impress upon you is that despite these films' public domain status, relative obscurity, and (almost always)B-movie budgets you could not ask for a better way to obtain 13 hours' worth of gritty film noir entertainment. For, unlike most genres, film noir was a style that didn't need expensive sets, costumes, music, or special effects. It's the writing and the direction that make film noir work - and the 9 films contained on these DVDs have excellent writing and direction. You may not recognise the names of many of the lead actors, but you will remember all nine of these movies upon seeing them.

Audio and video quality are acceptable. These are most likely TV prints intended for your local ""Late Late Movie"" and as such, contain scratches and a sometimes harsh mono soundtrack. St. Clair Entertainment are more honest about this than are other public domain providers. There are useful chapter stops in all the movies,and each DVD features a slightly different, customized menu. As a bonus (and bonuses on public domain discs like these are rare), we have a Film Noir Poster Gallery, a collection of movie trailers, and a mini-documentary overview of the genre. The only debit is a lack of subtitles. I imagine many of the people buying this DVD set may be older, and having subtitles is a courtesy that is always welcome.

If these films were restored, and contained subtitles, this would be a 5-star set and could easily command three times the price it's getting now. As it is, ""Classic Film Noir"" is an amazing bargain. Anyone interested in moody crime melodrama would be well-advised to seek out this collection. If you've recently seen ""Sin City"" and would like to check out classic film noir, start here!",1115424000,80,1890,4.848297213622291
2197245,5,B0006Z2NS6,"Well, ""Noirist"", I understand your frustration with Amazon for not listing the contents of this collection. These public domain film noirs have been released countless times already, but never have so many been offered for such a small price. Keep in mind that they ARE public domain movies, so don't expect perfection in picture or sound quality, although on this collection they're offered in 5.1 Surround Sound (which is nice).

Disc 1 on this 3-disc collection contains ""Too Late For Tears"", ""The Man Who Cheated Himself"", and ""The Stranger"".
Bonus features on this disc are a photo gallery & vintage film noir poster gallery (I LOVE those classic posters!). I'm a little puzzled by the various ""Casablanca"" posters being included in the film noir poster gallery, though!

""Too Late For Tears"" (1949) stars Lizabeth Scott (one of the best femme fatales!) & Dan Duryea & is a great tale of greed and murder.

""The Man Who Cheated Himself"" (1950) stars Lee J.Cobb & Jane Wyatt and is a forgettable low-budget crime drama. The picture and sound quality in this movie were simply awful.

""The Stranger"" (1946) stars Orson Welles (in a wonderfully sinister role!), Loretta Young, and Edward G. Robinson (in a rare good guy role) & is truly a great classic.

Disc 2 contains ""The Strange Love of Martha Ivers"", ""The Hitch-Hiker"", and ""Quicksand"". Included on this disc is a featurette ""About Film Noir"" (which isn't very impressive).

""The Strange Love of Martha Ivers"" (1946) is one of my favorite noirs of all time, and stars Barbara Stanwyck (in an unforgettable femme fatale role!), Van Heflin, Kirk Douglas (in his debut, I believe), and Lizabeth Scott. It's about a woman with a troubled past that eventually catches up with her.

""The Hitch-Hiker"" (1952) is directed by the great Ida Lupino and stars Edmund O'Brien, Frank Lovejoy, and William Talman. It's a suspenseful tale of a psychotic hitchhiker who holds two men captive.

""Quicksand"" (1950) stars baby-faced Mickey Rooney, Jeanne Cagney, and Peter Lorre (who gets too little screen time) and is an adverage but enjoyable tale of a good guy who's led astray by a femme fatale.

Disc 3 contains ""Detour"", ""The Scar"", and ""D.O.A."". There are also a few theatrical trailers on this disc.

""Detour"" (1945) stars Tom Neal & Ann Savage and represents ultra low-budget noir at its best! It's yet another tale of a man who's downfall is brought on by a deadly woman. By the way, I've compared this with my Alpha dvd of ""Detour"" and this IS a better restored version.

""The Scar"" A.K.A. ""Hollow Triumph"" (1948) stars Paul Henreid (one of the stars of 1942's ""Casablanca"") and Joan Bennett, and is a depressing tale of a mobster on the run who finds out (the hard way) that changing identity was not a good escape!

""D.O.A."" (1949) is one of the best examples of ultra low-budget film noir, and stars Edmond O'Brien, Pamela Britton, and Luther Adler. A man is poisoned and tries to solves his own murder before he dies!

If you haven't already bought these movies on other dvd editions, this is the best deal and I highly recommend it to all fans of classic film noir.",1105488000,570,3120,4.809345794392524
2197246,3,B0006Z2NS6,"Lately I've been on a Film Noir kick. So I was delighted to see The Classic Movie Pack listed. First off it states ""Over 13 Hours"". The film durations are listed with the majority coming in around 99 minutes or less. It is not over 13 Hours of viewing pleasure. Secondly the quality of the prints for the vast majority of the films are abysmal. The are a ""few"" exceptions. The Stranger, Strange Love Of Martha Ivers and possibly The Scar have decent transfers. The first film I watched was ""Too Late For Tears"". Here again the print was awful. Also the majority of the films do not adhere to the definition of Film Noir....shadows or plot.",1386633600,6,639,4.47008547008547
2197247,4,B0006Z2NS6,"The last time the name Barbara Standwyck appeared in this space she and Fred MacMurry were plotting, plotting big time, to murder her husband for his life insurance policy (and other considerations left unsaid ) in the film adaptation of James M. Cain's Double Indemnity. Times have changed for Ms. Standwyck though as here in Witness To Murder she off-handedly witnesses what she believes is a murder of a woman by a man in the apartment building across from her one night. And, unlike in Double Indemnity where everybody and their brother (and sister) KNOWS she and Fred did the deed here she cannot get anyone to believe her. Especially when the mad man who actually did the deed was a Svengali -like mastermind, an alleged ex-Nazi (although that de-nazification  program stuff after World War II didn't seem to take in his case), played by George Sanders.

Now the problem with accusing someone of murder, murder most foul , who actually did the deed is that unless and  you have a body you are in trouble trying to pin the rap on him. Moreover, yelling bloody murder about the guy is going to, well, put him off-balance especially when he is lined up to marry into some serious California dough. So you might as well say Ms. Standwyck's life just got very complicated, very complicated in deed when she takes a small stand for some rough justice in this wicked old world. Worst this murderer is so smooth that the cops, the guys who are supposed to live to solve dastardly crimes are practically taking up a collection for the poor guy and are ready putting her in the loony bin, for good. Really. Of course one cop, the love interest cop played by Gary Merrill is not going to let a smart, sassy, good-looking woman go under without a fight. So you know in the end that this case will get solved and old Mr. Smoothie will get his just desserts. But doesn't Ms. Standwyck have a case for dereliction of duty or something against those nay-saying cops.",1362096000,,1956,4.598853868194842

2197251,5,B0006Z2NS6,"Classic Film Noir
St. Clair Entertainment Group

In an era when most CD movies are plain silver discs requiring an electron microscope to decipher the movie title, viewers will appreciate the easy legibility of this  well packaged and presented group of films from St. Clair Entertainment Group that come with full credits as to year, running time, and major stars, although curiously, Disc 3 does not list Edmund O'Brien or Pamela Britton as staring in the Rudolph Mat thriller D.O.A.

Disc One
Too Late For Tears
The first of two films featuring perhaps the badest bad girl of noir, Lizabeth Scott.  It takes a lot to survive a relationship with her character, Jane Palmer; even as the movie ends another man is said to meet his demise at her hands.  The script lets you know she was her own industry by the time this film was made in 1949.  A purloined bundle of cash is the real main character; holding onto it brings out Jane's unwavering avarice.  ""Don't change, Tiger.  I don't know if I'd like you with a heart,""  her partner Danny, played convincingly by Dan Duryea, tells her.  When Don Blake, played by Don Defore, thinks he has found some answers, he watches nervously as Jane's fingers move toward her handbag. ""What's in the purse?"" he demands.  ""Lipstick"" she replies.  ""Colt or Smith & Wesson?"" he asks.  Technical glitches and splices gone awry impair this film, although as a vehicle for the femme fatale motif and for its insights into the career of Lizabeth Scott, the picture is still valuable.

The Man Who Cheated Himself is a sardonic title about the corrupting influence of money, with Felix Feist directing Lee J. Cobb in the title role of Detective Ed Cullen, an experienced San Francisco gumshoe who should have known better than sacrifice his career for socialite Lois Frazier, played to perfection by Jane Wyatt.  Cobb is paired with John Dall, as his neophyte brother Andy who is just learning the sleuthing business.  While Ed has fallen into a coziness of routine accompanied by an even laxer morality, Andy is laser focused on solving the murder of Frazier's husband regardless of where the evidence points.  Contains some fine cinematography and a Hitchcockesque scene involving Lois' languidly floating scarf that evokes the vanishing nature of the dream she and Ed shared.

The Stranger
Edgar G. Robinson plays a determined investigator, Mr. Wilson, who works for a UN  War Crimes Tribunal determined to break up a ring of former Nazis and bring them to justice.  The trail leads Wilson to a small Connecticut town where he must convince Mary Longstreet (Loretta Young) that she has married his prime suspect.  Noteworthy for its probe into the predictive power of behavioral psychology and the influence of the subconscious.  Contains many of the features that made an Orson Wells film special:  interplay between light and dark, tight camera angles, understated articulation of deep philosophical principles.  A slip up by the copyright holders allowed this film to fall into public domain.

Disc 2
Strange Love of Martha Ivers doesn't suffer from the abruptness of D.O.A.'s ending, in fact, it has the kind of shocking finale that makes a movie unforgettable.  The film is made even more intriguing by the fact that Van Hefflin, as Sam Masterson - Martha's childhood playmate who returns to town after an 18 year hiatus, survives even though he breaks a cardinal rule of noir cinema: never turn your back on Barbara Stanwyck.  This film is well made from beginning to end, and also features a compelling performance by Lizabeth Scott in a role that has become taboo for contemporary cinema: the female ex-con.

The Hitchhiker is a didactic piece of cinema attempting to warn travelers of the dangers inherent in hitchhiking.  Indeed, the film's marketing campaign asks ""Who Will Be His Next Victim: You?""  The didactic genre was fairly common in the 1940's and 1950's and has its  extension in a film like The Sniper, which is not included in the current package.  There is even a message from the producers as the film begins.  The shortcoming of this movie lies in the unrelenting brutality of its psychotic protagonist, so much so that I found myself fast forwarding through the film to the point of the villain's eventual capture.

Quicksand
Mickey Rooney as auto mechanic Dan Brady can't catch a break and gets shaken down time after time for bigger and bigger stakes in another didactic classic intended to show ""what a tangled web we weave when at first we do deceive.""  Ironicly, his luck changes for the better when he pulls a gun on a motorist who turns out to be a kindly lawyer.  When he ditches femme fatale Vera Novak (Jeanne Cagney) and reunites with his loyal admirer Helen (Barbara Bates), we know there's hope down the road and he'll get the shortest prison sentence possible. Valuable for the display of almost hyperkinetic energy Rooney give the film.

Disc 3
D.O.A. is a film that is flawed by its ending, which is much too abrupt, although that shortcoming is more than offset by the brilliant cinematography which features some of the best hard bop jazz committed to film.  Academy Award winner Edmund O'Brien (The Barefoot Contessa) as victim Frank Bigelow and Pamela Britton as his needy and vulnerable paramour Paula achieve a connection on film that is honest and believable.  It is the performances of the actors, and the camera work, not the script, that raises this film from the level of ordinary it might otherwise have been consigned to.  Director Rudolph Mate uses bus scenes, night life and especially Bigelow's romp through San Francisco streets to achieve a verisimilitude on city life.

The Scar
People earn the fate they deserve in this story of attraction, murder and double identity starring Paul Henreid  as John Muller and Joan Bennett as tough minded but still vulnerable Evelyn Hahn who falls in love with a man having a dubious past.  His ambition to reintegrate himself into society after a lengthy prison term leads him to take unsanctioned shortcuts.  A subsequent detour into netherworlds and Evelyn's accompaniment almost mirror the details of Joan Bennett's real life in which her husband Walter Wanger, shot her film agent, Jennings Lang.

Detour
With its hitchhiking theme, Detour is paired well in this package, yet it too suffers from the same drawback as The Hitchhiker, an unrelenting brutality, this time from a female character, and the effect is the same: a monochromatic performance bordering on unwatchable.  Detour at least, is redeemed by a story line more complex than Hitchhiker but ends abruptly with no real solution to the concepts it introduces.",1299628800,11,6656,4.923835125448028
2197252,5,B0006Z2NS6,"WOW! What great movies. Not a bad one in the entire pack, in my opinion. The Mickey Rooney one almost seems a little out of place, but once you watch the entire thing, it too is a good film. These are excellent examples of 'Film Noir' movies, and are a wonderful treat to watch. As far as I am concerned, all of the films in this 9 pack are more than worth the money....which is a good value to begin with. If you like 'Film Noir', buy it! If you don't know 'Film Noir', buy it! You won't be disappointed.",1242172800,3,505,4.06

2197254,4,B0006Z2NS6,"I have not had time to see all 13 hours, but the 3 or 4 movies that I have seen were as expected.  The quality was not up to the ""restored"" sets with the higher price, but they were the same as you would see on late night TV in the old days.  It was quite fun to watch these as they may have been shown years ago.  I am pleased with the set and think it was well worth the price.",1233619200,4,379,3.597560975609756
2197255,4,B0006Z2NS6,"These 3-disc film noir packs are going for two-three bucks per DVD disc.  Are they worth it?  Remember when you passed up a public domain movie on the local access channel because the print was so dark and blurry?  Or maybe you're old enough to have seen ""It's a Wonderful Life"" or ""Citizen Kane"" in any number of inferior duplicate prints (often duplicates of duplicates)?

Fortunately, both of the latter films have been replaced by new editions struck from the original masters.  But what's inescapable is the proliferating amount of product (film, books, records) and the inability of technology to keep up with its preservation (even digitalized ""texts"" are not exempt--if not from the ravages of time, from constantly changing technologies that can't ""read"" previous technologies).

The films are watchable, the scripts are mostly fail-safe examples of the genre, the actors and acting are more than equal to the task.  It's the cinematography that suffers.  So turn up the brightness (and sharpness) control on your set to maximum and enjoy these now and then (Lizabeth Scott and Dan Duryea make for a terrific opening act--a credible variation on Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck in ""Double Indemnity"").  And perhaps it's good to be reminded that even though ""It's a Wonderful Life"" and ""Citizen Kane"" are now available in crisp, detailed and vivid prints, the general public seems to have little more interest in the fresh prints than the old dark and blurry ones (the former film is once again fading from memory, and I've seen the priceless new edition of ""Kane"" offered for less than ten bucks.)",1231718400,2,1610,5.022556390977444

8043896,3,B0006Z2NS6,"This is a collection of noir films, many of which are seldom seen. Theyre interesting as period pieces for the most part although several of them were struck from really terrible prints with lots of noise and hunks missing. The Strange Love of Martha Ivers is the standout here but you can find it in better shape in other collections.",1424131200,3,335,4.6
