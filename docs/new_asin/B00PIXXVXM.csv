8688184,3,B00PIXXVXM,"Dissappointing by the standards set before. There have been fewer topics which have been given extended time on each episode. The Flight Attendants School was a cheap fill in with no real substance, Hanger Flying another ""what to do next"" bit a waste of viewers time-arguing who owns the best aircraft, and 100 Years of Commercial Flight was just a re-hash of an overdone topic covered by other series. This item appears on the box on the wrong disc. Anthony Nalli has become irritating in his narrations reading from a script while trying to make nearly every word sound exciting! What happened to the other presenters?",1457136000,,620,4.8584905660377355
