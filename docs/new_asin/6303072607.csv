553870,4,6303072607,"Plenty of reviews have already mentioned the racial component to this film.  I was somewhat surprised that Warners gave this film a DVD release because of it.  However, they should be applauded for releasing the film without censoring or burying it, if only to reveal the film as a document of its time.

That said, HAUNTED GOLD is really a fascinating mixture of genres.  If Charles Dickens had written a western it might have looked like this.  Erville Alderson carries himself like Uriah Heep.  The dark house, with its secret passages and secrets in general, looks a lot like the old house in Don Knott's THE GHOST AND MR. CHICKEN.  Throw in an episode of Scooby Doo and you have a pretty good idea of HAUNTED GOLD.

The mix of genres--mystery, western, comedy--makes for an interesting novelty picture, if not an interesting western.

For a couple of dollars more, this film is also available as a Triple Feature DVD with RIDE HIM, COWBOY and THE BIG STAMPEDE.  The Triple Feature DVD, though a double-sided disc with no extras, is certainly the better buy.",1194825600,,1062,4.754098360655738
553871,3,6303072607,"""Haunted Gold"" gets a 3 star rating in my book because it is rather unique among the pre-""Stagecoach"" John Wayne movies.  Most of those early movies do well to warrent a 2 star rating and are worth watching solely because Wayne is generally always worth watching.  When it comes to plots, however, they all tend to follow a predictable sequence; young woman's family encounters trouble from bad guys, John Wayne emerges to help, bad guys temporarily disgrace, discredit or disempower Wayne's character, young lady and family fall victim (often with the loss of grandfather, father, uncle, or older brother), Wayne returns to action and saves the day, the ranch, and the girl (for himself).  All this usually takes about 55 minutes and involves a trusty horse (often Duke), a comical sidekick or two, and the evil nemisis.

In ""Haunted Gold"" you might say that all the elements are there but give the writer credit for adding a strong element of suspense (at least strong for B movie standards).  A group of men are called to an abandoned mine in the Old West.  There is a phantom lurking about, peeping through peep holes, and disappearing into nowhere.  There is also Blue Washington, a Black actor in ""Haunted Gold"" whom I didn't recall from any other movies.  However, I googled his name and the word actor.  Besides being remind by numerous entries about Washington being a politically Blue state, I saw that Blue Washington appeared in a number of movies during the 20's and 30's (including bit parts in ""King Kong"" and GWTW).  I mention this because I thought he was pretty good in his role.  Unfortunately, it was difficult to see him in his role as a sort of underpaid Stepin Fetchit.  Naturally, he gets scared more than any of the others and there's the scene where he gets covered with dirt and dust and turns ""white"".  Otherwise, the mystery, the exciting fight scenes, the scret entrances and exits, all serve to make this early Wayne movie a cut above the others.",1163116800,3,1977,4.762463343108505
553872,2,6303072607,"I found myself bored with this as I do with all of Dukes earlier works.  Fun to watch once but I never feel the need to repeat viewings. Haunted Gold is an average B western with the same substandard script and poor  acting,  but the action is very good.  As for the earlier Duke films, if  you're looking for quality westerns, I HIGHLY recommend the following:  Helltown(Dukes best early performance), The Big Trail(Absolutley a grand  spectacle in early filmmaking and the first widescreen movie)and Angel and  the Badman(good script).",964224000,11,537,4.955056179775281

7836679,3,6303072607,"I viewed this film for only one reason. It may not have been worth it. I wanted to see a film that contained the ""Black Bird"" used in ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941).

Spooky town, sliding panels, mysterious tunnels, spooky eyes, and a phantom all have to be dealt with in this film. More still unrealistic characters, stilted dialog and a suggestion that the phantom had a watermelon accent.

Basic story is different owners and quasi owners of an abandoned gold mine were invites by cryptic letters promising it is worth the trip. One of the owners of the mine is a young John Wayne.

If you are wondering why Duke is a better actor than most the other characters, that is because he had six moves to his acting career and dialog aside has the most visual cliffhanger action. One of the most memorable scenes in this film is when Clarence (Blue Washington) is in a phantom suite and Duke is ready to kill. Clarence asks ""Duke don't you recognize me and Duke shakes his head no. Clarence takes off the phantom hood and asks Duke again this time Duke shakes his head yes.

This has all the feel of a serial. And we are not sure it will wrap up.",1511654400,,1140,4.388625592417061

7836681,5,6303072607,"Beware the glaring eyes in the wall..........especially when they show up later glaring from the inside a clock!  Haunted Gold is a remake of The Phantom City.  Its almost like The Old Dark House goes west.  A spooky character calling himself The Phantom is hard at work trying to discourage a band of crooks hoping to strike it rich with hidden gold.  A special invite is sent to the other shareholders in the mine.  The problem is not everyone wants to share.  Can the villain be outsmarted, allowing John Mason (John Wayne) and Janet Carter (Sheila Terry) to collect the gold they're due?  Or will the villain torture the secret out of the sole surviving miner and take off with the loot requiring an extended chase sequence involving a fistfight in a speeding wagon?  At least it got them out of the spooky ghost town!

Wayne is once again aided and abetted by his miracle-horse Duke, who runs for help like Lassie and stops a bad guy with a well played shove over a cliff.  Love that horse!  As for the rest of the film, it runs its course with a lot of ill-conceived comic relief by Blue Washington (in a stereotypical portrayal that was pretty standard for the time period.  But.  This also included some racist labels that made me cringe).  Otherwise, not bad.  I found it very entertaining.",1491350400,,1299,4.586956521739131

7836686,3,6303072607,"One of John Wayne's earliest starring vehicles, ""Haunted Gold"" (1932) is a lively genre-bending Western produced by Leon Schlesinger in a departure from his Warner Bros. cartoon output. Mixing ""old dark house"" chills with hard-riding thrills, the hour-long programmer utilizes stock footage from Ken Maynard's ""The Phantom City"" (1928). Politically incorrect to the extreme, but good fun as the Duke develops his screen persona. ""B"" Westerns rarely look this sharp in terms of video quality.",1282780800,4,491,5.56
7836687,4,6303072607,"An early John Wayne western that only ran for an hour, this was surprisingly entertaining. Since he was a beginning actor and this was a Grade B-type of production, I didn't except it to be so entertaining, although now that I've watched a lot of early '30s films, I am not surprised. Movies in that era were pretty fast- moving ones.

What makes this fun is the combination of western action, a few spooky things and comedy. The latter is mostly supplied by Blue Washington who plays ""Clarence Washington Brown,"" a Mantan Morleand-like character. Yeah, I know this kind of role is demeaning to blacks and it's almost embarrassing to watch nowadays, but Washington was funny. He is a big contributor in making the film fun. The ""western"" part of the story is just so-so.",1235088000,,770,4.703703703703703
