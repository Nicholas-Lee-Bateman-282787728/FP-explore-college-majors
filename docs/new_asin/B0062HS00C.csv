8491145,4,B0062HS00C,"This 2011 Qubec film seems to start unpromisingly, depicting the ""nicey-nice"" aura of pious Roman Catholic religion practised (but also some stressful family life lived out) in Montral of the late 1950s. The problems of the young girl, Lonie (played as young girl by child actress Ariane Legault), with bladder control, on the physical side, and unhealthy obsession with the church life of her parish, are there from the get-go, but the ""sweet Jesus"" mood of it seems sentimentally cloying. The leading figure among the nuns, Sr. Ccile, also is just too holy-sweetie-pie for her own (or the child's) good.

As it turns out, however, the opening makes a dramatic contrast to the air of simmering, suppressed eroticism that ensues when a young Puerto Rican postulant for the priesthood, on the verge of ordination (which he receives in Montral) in the Dominican order, arrives among these women. Victor Andrs Turgeon-Trelles, a sweetly handsome young Peruvian-Qubcois actor, embodies this smooth-faced young priest with sensuously lanky beauty, a slightly exotic appeal, and exceptionally radiant complexion. Turgeon-Trelles is even more strikingly the elegantly lovely young man, of irresistible physical appeal, when he is out of costume, trimly bearded, as one views him participating in the bonus special feature included.

Lonie develops a school-girl ""crush"" on Fr. Malachy. Of far more serious consequence, Sr. Ccile, a parish school teaching nun (as Madeleine Ploquin, a young actress who herself is of irresistibly great beauty, takes the part) falls in love with Fr. Malachy, who reciprocates her passion. The agonies of conscience and of self-mortification, all hag-ridden with the scrupulosity and sexual up-tightness so endemic, even nowadays and much more so then in those days just preceding the Second Vatican Council, among Catholics. A written indiscretion in Sr. Ccile's hand, and the child's confession to another priest eventually betray their attraction for each other and the two reluctant lovers are parted.

Years later the triangle (i.e. Malachy, Lonie, and Ccile) cross paths in old age. Among those playing the roles of the elderly man and of the two ageing women, Genevive Bujold, as the old Ccile, is the most famous of the three actors depicting these seniors. It would be unadvisable to go into detail about what ensues on their reunion, since the potential viewer should discover that for himself! Their reunion is full of tenderness and gently romantic irony, let it be said, leaving things at that.

Given the modest means available to Micheline Lanctt, whose film this largely is (and who plays the agd Lonie), this film from Mongrel Media stands up well to close visual scrutiny, looking quite professional. The intimate drama of frustrated eroticism and Qubcois religiosity is, indeed, worth one's trouble to acquire the DVD (Mtopole DVD-4708 being the domestic Qubec edition viewed) and to see it. Fortunately, the French-language film includes good English subtitles (although the excellent and rather extensive bonus special feature lacks them).",1420070400,2,3084,5.3525773195876285
