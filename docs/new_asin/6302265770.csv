7823348,5,6302265770,Back in the mid60s I started collecting 8mm slient film comedies from Blackhawk films.. My family's projector had no sound. And none was needed since these films were made as silent films. (The theaters of the time would play background music.)  I played Scott Joplin ragtime in background.  Blackhawk films had a exclusive agreement with Hal Roach Studio's  so Blackhawk had most of Hal's  Little Rascals and Laurel and Hardy films. The Silent films were the cheapest. And I would usually buy that month's 1/2 price special. For around $6. And eventually I purchased almost all of Laurel and Hard's silents shorts.  Most were 20 minutes of pure joy. Laurel and Hardy's big business I think is the best short comedy ever made. I enjoyed showing it to friends who continually laughed their heads off through the last half of the film. Later I got a sound project and could afford to buy the L&H super 8 sound films of the 30s. But in my mind L&H 20s films were the best. Unfortunately no one sells them anymore. This VHS version of the parts in them is all that I can find on Amazon. And happy to have it.,1490832000,,1104,4.527638190954774

It takes you back to their beginning days. Yo must remember in those days there were no ""talkies""The sound was dubbed in later asnd totally unsofiscated,the production was very rudimentary ;but at that time about all these actors had to work with were movements,and facial expressions. However ,when it came to comedy and viewer enjoyment,it set the standard,and it's debatable if it has ever been surpassed. This is a VHs of 1 hour and 30 minutes of snippits from their performances ,all from the time of silent movies. The quality of the video is very good ,particularly when the originals were filmed.
This is one of 3 Videos that was released in a set in 1992 but I can't find here on Amazon. The other 2 Videos are ""The Devil's Brother"" and ""Bonnie Scotland"".",1422316800,,901,4.672955974842767

7823351,5,6302265770,A good video of perhaps one of the greatest comedic duos of the last century. Most of the documentary has a speaker who tells what is going on since all the scenes are from Laurel & Hardy's silent era. Very enjoyable.,1412553600,,217,4.317073170731708
7823352,1,6302265770,"Laurel and Hardy`s Laughing 20s(released in 1965)is Robert Youngson`s look back at the Boys silent efforts. It didn`t have the panache of his first big hit When Comedy was King,but it still had a very wide appeal and audience back in /65.
Televista,by what I can see,has copied the MGM VHS version. You can still see the ``ghost``lines to the right of each figure on screen(a well known quirk of VHS tape).What they have done to make it look different than the MGM version is to soften the picture and darken the contrast...too much so. I have the MGM version and it is quite clear and the contrast is just right.
So why buy this DVD.A good question. DON`T,is my advice;unless you have never seen this film before or just HAVE to have it for your collection no matter what the picture looks like. For others that have seen it at one time or other,keep those good memories and give this ``pirated`` version a wide pass. The films presented here are priceless,but this DVD version does them NO justice what so ever.",1326326400,6,1013,4.571428571428571
7823353,2,6302265770,"I had been looking forward to the release of this film on DVD for years and was excited to hear that it had finally arrived.  it was terribly disappointing to find out that this copy is no better than the VHS version.  it might even be worse!  it looks like it was sloppily transferred from an old beat up print with no improvements made.  the picture is very dark, has little detail, tears, heavy scratches, dirt chunks, dirt flurries and numerous missing frames. shame on the production company to not have digitally cleaned it up.  I guess they'll do it right in another few years so they can try to make more money off those of us who already purchased this turkey!  if this is as good as it's gonna' get, then try to disregard my review and buy it. the material within the film itself is awesome!",1322697600,3,801,4.378378378378378
7823354,4,6302265770,"The first feature-length compilation devoted to Stan and Ollie's silent classics, ""Laurel and Hardy's Laughing 20's"" (1965) is terrific fun. Perusing the Hal Roach studio vaults, producer Robert Youngson has assembled some of the team's finest moments from 1927 to 1929 - with Charley Chase, Edgar Kennedy and Max Davidson thrown in for good measure. A memorable display of silent-film comedy at its glorious peak.",1309564800,3,414,5.384615384615385
7823355,4,6302265770,"Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were gifted comedians (some might say they were too gifted) of the classic Hollywood era, moving from silent short subjects into feature-length sound films. While their faces are still recognizable today, much of their material lays unseen in out-of-print videos or expensive foreign collections. ""Laurel and Hardy's Laughing 20s"" once had a wide release, was easily accessible, and is an ideal introduction for people who are new to the comedy stylings of the perfect comedy duo. It contains clips from several of their silent comedies and the sequences are remarkable. There's Laurel dressed as a highlander, unable to keep his kilt down. There's a hilarious segment involving the serving of soup at a high society dinner. And, perhaps best of all, is an extended sequence in which Laurel and Hardy find themselves atop a skyscraper under construction. I can't stop laughing every time I see these routines, even though I know them by heart.

As for Robert Youngson, in the 1960s Youngson created a successful series of compilation films, piecing together clips from old Mack Sennett and Hal Roach comedies, combining them with new soundtracks and usually tasteful narration, and introducing young people to comedians that might otherwise be obscure. Purists might argue that Youngson would have done a better job if he'd simply re-released the original short subjects, but I disagree. As feature-length films, Youngson's compilations would later be shown on late-night TV and have a potentially wider distribution than a narrower, straighter re-release. ""Laurel and Hardy's Laughing 20s"" is Youngson's finest re-editing job.

I'd love to see this film and other Youngson compilations released on DVD so that they could do what they were intended to do - reintroduce people to the gentle slapsttick talents of people like Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy. Until that day comes, this is a film well worth tracking down on VHS.",1104710400,10,1952,5.213375796178344
