2408485,2,B000B8ISPA,"The famous ballet scene was omitted. They made Margeurite a nun which she never was, and it just doesn't work. Worst of all, they altered the original ending which depicted forgiveness and salvation (visually and in words and music)into a visually ghastly, gruesome scene totally inconsistent with the celestial music. Such changes to a masterpiece, whether it be a famous opera, as here, or to a Rembrandt cannot be justified, whether under a banner of ""creativity"" or any other.",1168732800,37,480,5.0886075949367084
2408486,4,B000B8ISPA,Being a big fan of Ken Russell - the opera's director - I was a little let down it wasn't as outrageous as I had expected. The most contentious idea is Margarite as a nun. I don't think it works for obvious reasons. But what a lot of life Russell breathes into this dusty  corpse. It isn't Eurotrash. It brings ballet into the action itself instead of being relegated to the final act. Indeed I was really surprised Russell didn't include the Walpurgis Night which would have given flight to all his excesses. Oh well. The singing and conducting are up to par. At this time any ordinary production of Faust would be sleep inducing. Hooray for Russell. Hope his film fans find and enjoy this DVD - they may be seduced by him into opera as I was seduced years ago into Tommy and Rock.,1158105600,20,782,4.3561643835616435
2408487,3,B000B8ISPA,"This live performance (1985) from Vienna's famous State Opera House has a solid cast, except for the director. Araiza and Benackova have the appropriate lyric voices for Faust and Marguerite. Araiza performs a very sensitive and worshipful cavatina, ""Salut! Demeure."" Benackova does her best to express an innocent excitement upon viewing herself with a crown of jewels in the famous ""Jewel Song,"" but it seems out of place with her nun's attire. (Yes, in Act II, she is packaged as a nun!) Raimondi has a smooth and strong voice, even though he lacks the devilish and sarcastic coloring of the late Nicolai Ghiaurov. The picture (somewhat grainy), and the sound quality are superior to the current list of Faust DVD's. For the most part, the sets are impressive--but not necessarily appropriate--and rather somber. The opera opens and closes in Faust's spacious study with a symbolic view of the sky and higher realm. The opera often resembles a ballet as dancers appear as apparitions to accompany the vocalists.

In the notes that accompany the DVD, we learn that the director, Ken Russell, wanted to make the seduction of Marguerite, in his words, less ""silly"" and more ""realistic"" and ""vivid."" (It should be noted that Russell's reading, assuming he read Goethe's first part, is at odds with most reviews of Faust.) To add ""realism"" to Faust's conquest and Marguerite's punishment, there are some symbolic sets, costumes, and scenes that will strike many viewers as rather bizarre and sometimes offensive. To prepare the viewer, here are a few examples of why this production was very controversial. Instead of an attractive vision of Marguerite in front of a spinning wheel, we see a rather unalluring image of a woman sending a cryptic message by way of sign language--probably not the kind of image that would have prompted the aging Faust to sign a contract with the devil. In the famous and romantic garden scene, Marguerite appears fully dressed as a nun, and her garden is paved in stone rather than plants. Apparently, her religious habit is not very disconcerting to the arduous Faust because, after their duet, we see them rolling together on the pavement, in one of the strangest seduction scenes in the history of opera. Finally, Russell decides to focus on Marguerite's punishment for murdering her illegitimate child rather than her pardon and redemption. Instead of angels bearing her spirit heavenward, we see and hear the sound of a guillotine. In the closing scene, Faust is back in his study and seated in front of Marguerite's casket. As a morbid reminder of their indiscretions, a headless corpse rises and falls inside the casket.

Symbolic sets, costumes, and scenes serve a very useful purpose when they clarify and enhance the spirit of the story and nature of the characters. Unfortunately, Russell's symbolism distorts what both Goethe and Gounod had in mind, and they probably would have strongly disapproved of Russell's alterations to the theme and depiction of Marguerite. For example, both Goethe and Gounod focused on Marguerite's redemption and not her punishment, and neither one of them would have pictured her as a nun in a bizarre seduction scene. Goethe once claimed that his nature was too conciliatory to compose a true tragedy. The end of the second part reunites the lovers in heaven to the devil's disappointment. Gounod has been criticized, often unfairly, for not following the classic poem more closely. In order to produce a popular and entertaining opera, Gounod did leave out sections of the story, but he remained true to the spirit of Goethe's Faust. In addition to being a composer of operas and religious music, Gounod was a literary scholar who wrote reviews. No doubt there is an audience for Russell's attempt to revise one of the greatest poetic masterpieces in literature--probably the same audience who would like to see Mephistopheles dressed as a priest and conducting the sacraments. However, more knowledgeable fans of the poem and opera are likely to find his revisions disconcerting and inappropriate. This production is probably worth four stars if you are willing to overlook the director's misconceived symbolism. Alas, it appears that Faust lovers will have to continue to wait for an outstanding production of Gounod's great opera on DVD.",1157587200,90,4314,5.09180790960452
2408488,5,B000B8ISPA,"Ken Russell's production is atmospheric with a few ideas thrown in to give the production some spice! The singing is excellent, with Raimondi drawing the biggest applause from the audience.

8083353,1,B000B8ISPA,"For all those who claim that this Russell ""Faust"" is fine if you simply don't look at it, I would remind them that a hand has five fingers....orchestral music; singing;  acting;  sets, makeup, costumes & lighting; ballet; and in the case of recorded productions, camera work and sound mixing.  While orchestral music is a nice thumb, the thumb is a useless part of the hand without fingers.  Opera is the culmination of all the arts.  Art loses its life if you strangle it in pieces, as Russell does.  Russell is a thief who has robbed us all of beauty.  He has stolen the work of others for personal gain.
In Russell's corrupt opera, at the very beginning, we see Faust attempt to bring a dead girl back to life using a Frankenstein-like mechanism.  EVERYBODY knows Faust is a philosopher, not a neurosurgeon.  Like directors of the most-amateurish Gilbert & Sullivan productions, Russell invents new characters - notably the deaf-mute children of Valentin.  These children are so important to Russell's ""vision,"" he has them take a bow before the curtain with  Araiza, Raimondi, Benackova, Sramek, Sima, and Grounroos!  Marguerite's ballade about the King of Thule is told to the children in sign language!  Why list Livret and Carre at all on the program if Russell himself changes the story of the opera?
This production is a mess from beginning to end.  But most damnable in the corruption we experience is Russell's attempt to turn the whole opera into ballet - with swarms of female dancers buzzing in nearly every scene.
The 32-page booklet contains no libretto.  It is divided into English, French, and German sections.  Some black & white photos.  Peter Blaha has written a three-page explanation of how this disaster came to be.  ""The 'Faust' libretto now seems rather silly,"" says Russell.  ""He loves her, she loves him - so why do they need the devil?""  The answer to Russell's question would be obvious to anyone who bothered to read the libretto.  The devil introduced the two; the devil choreographed their courtship as well as Faust's complicity in Marguerite's moral ruin.
Purity, innocence, general-goodness are not enough qualities for Russell's Marguerite.  She must also be a nun in order to better compete with Mephistopheles.
The enormous golden calf's head which spews golden coins was Russell's tribute to himself - reminding us of his film ""Tommy.""  (In America, we already have a ""very stable genius.""  We don't need Russell.)",1521244800,,2454,4.958333333333333
8083354,5,B000B8ISPA,"I haven't seen this video but I was lucky enough to attend this opera in Vienna and I loved it.. The rest of the audience did too. It's been
one of the best memories of my 1985 trip to Europe so I'm surprised to find it here and then learn that so many people don't like it.
If you want to watch it then view it with an open mind and I think you'll enjoy it as I did.",1441584000,,367,3.6582278481012658
8083355,5,B000B8ISPA,"I seriously begin to wonder why Amazon tolerates such bizarre senseless bombasting! So MANY reviews here that are nothing but lashings out of personal agendas: the reviewers did NOT even watch the piece in entirety.
Margeurite was NOT yet a nun - she might be contemplating, as many French girls did before marriage in the era of Gunound. Absolutely NOTHING WRONG for her nun habit in the first Act.
Marguerite went to heaven at the end, just as in ALL OTHER productions. There is absolutely NOTHING that is anti-feminist.
Back to the production - it has its own valid points, however much you prefer or detest it.
The direction sets a gloomy atmosphere that befits this work totally - on the other hand, the 2011 MET production does not have this atmospheric edge.
The main protagonists (Faust, Mephistofeles, Margeurite) are very well performed, but the subordinate cast (Siebel, Valentin) could have been better.
Of the three leads, Gabriela Benackova steals the show as Margeurite with her full-bodied yet utterly agile silvery timbre, and her apt stage presence. She is beautiful and modest, and has an air of utter sincerity that many, if not all, divas performing this role lacked. Her final scene with Raimondi and Araiza is also effective.
In the title role, Francisco Araiza is arguably not the ultimate Faust, but it is only in comparison with great interpretors like Alfredo Kraus. His darker yet lyrical timbre serves this role very well, if only the costume designer could be more imaginative than to require him to dorn an utterly unfit overcoat to pass for an aged Dr. Faust. Araiza's timbre tends to overpower his partners, but his 'tuning down' in the last Act's trio with Margeurite and Mephistofeles is artistically highly commendable.
Ruggero Raimondi is not the most powerful Devil and tends to bend before a plangent Faust, but his acting is very fine.
The choregraphy, which plays such an important part in this work, is at times wonderful and at times bizarre.
Music wise, however, this is a fully valid performance with full credits to the three lead singers.",1352160000,,2085,4.943019943019943
8083356,5,B000B8ISPA,"I have just read all the reviews of this now infamous production of Faust and would like to give my input. I bought it about 2 years ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. I feel that some of the reviews have gone completely into the story, all the switching of scenes, omissions and such which I found very enlightening and don't see the need to enter into that territory. My view is pretty straight forward. I honestly bought it because of Ruggero Raimondi, and when I read the booklet I got even more excited when I saw Ken Russell's name. It's been a long time since I've seen a feature film of Russells, but I loved so many of them because they were not what was considered the 'norm'. Perhaps it was a mood of wanting to see a very traditional, long-beloved opera done differently that made me enjoy it so much. I had never seen Araiza or Benackova before, but had seen Raimondi in both the Losey 'Don Giovanni' and the Rossi 'Carmen' so I knew he could act and of course never questioned the voice. I found Araiza wonderful. Such a graceful, lyric voice that I was very drawn to his performance as I was to Benackova. Yes, she may have needed to be younger and more innocently alluring, but the sweetness of her voice and sincerity worked for me. Even though Faust seems to always want Mephisto to be gone, this devil is always looking out of windows,lurking in doorways, leering in the shadows. Sorry Faust this devil will always be around. I quite liked the scene where Mephisto appears in a glistening dark blue costume, spreads his wings and thunders into the night. Even my brother, whose musical life concentrated around Hendrix, Allman Brothers, Dylan etc., was watching this opera with me, sat bolt upright from the sofa at this sight and said ""Wow'. From then on he was hooked to the point that he grabbed my arm  during the trial sequence when Raimondi appears costumed as a bishop/pope(?) and is miked in such a way that his voice is echoing all around, pulling you, shaking not only Marguerite, but you, the viewer. I found it to be very powerful theatre, the trial(which I loved because it was so dark and sinister), watching the so-called 'good villagers' pointing their finger at the demented Marguerite while above is the glistening silver light of heaven with a disgised devil all-magnificant in blue/white encrusted robes. We watch the crucifix go up and the guillotine come down, the heavenly light turning slowly into blood red. It's fun to enjoy at least vocally and visually all of this happening. I wanted to be jerked around a little bit by Russell and overall he could have gone alot crazier, but I think it was amazing theatre. Loved Raimondi!

Last thought. If you want to really be knocked off the couch then get the dvd of the Berlioz 'Damnation of Faust' done at Salzburg Festival in 1999. I have never seen this opera staged before and it took me several times to realize what the director was saying. It is the most brilliant use of Berlioz' music I have ever seen or heard. This is a visual rendition that has no equal. It will, if you let it, blow you away!
Thanks",1349481600,4,3097,4.548387096774194
8083357,4,B000B8ISPA,"I had great misgivings about this performance dating back to 1985 upon reading the various reviews, so even if I've got hold of this DVD for some years, I did not muster the courage to view it.  Having seen the MET HD production recently (with Kaufmann, Pape and Poplavskaya), I finally took the pains to view this `horrendous' production.
To call this production an `opera of horror' is quite an apt word - the very first scene of Act I evokes horror as the aged Faust tries unsuccessfully to `resuscitate' a dead girl that he wants to get.  As the plot evolves, more horror follows, namely the `seduction' of Marguerite is being presented as the seduction of a chaste nun. All these, I gather, are the director Ken Russell's doing. Throughout the performance, the sets are gloomy, with some choregraphy that are aptly eerie.
I hadn't heard Araiza singing anything else than Mozart, Donizetti and Rossini, and I hadn't heard Gabriela Beakov in this role of Marguerite. Here we have a performance from the Vienna State Opera, with the plot based on Goethe but significantly embellished by the Director.
This performance is unique in one sense - while Raimondi as Mphistophls is as good as you would expect, his voice is not as plangent as most other portrayals, notably that of Ghiaurov, Siepi, or Pape, more recently. In comparison, this `Devil' is not able to over-power Dr. Faustus!
Faust is traditionally a role for lyrical tenors (Kraus, then Beczala, but to name two). Ariaza is marvellous as Faust, having changed over from lyrical tenor to lirico spinto, he rises to the challenges of the title role admirably.  His dark tenor voice is still able to tackle the high tessitura required of Faust's role, and he handles the vocal requirements of the role with greater apparent ease than Jonas Kaufmann, the current spinto tenor by choice, if a spinto tenor is required at all for the role of Faust.
The late Walton Grnroos copes with the role of Marguerite's brother, Valentin. Siebel, described as a student of Faust, is sung by Gabriele Sima, quite well, as is Martha, Marguerite's neighbour, by Gertrude Jahn.

Gabriela Beakov as Marguerite is clearly competent: she can cope with the florid singing in the Jewel Aria, she has the high notes and certain power with them, and everything between. A tour-de-force in the league of the more recent Solie Isokoski, if not as outright distinguished as Marina Poplavskaya in the recent MET HD production.

The conductor Erich Binder generally makes a good job, but the first duet between Faust and Mphistophls is too fast, while the Scene of Marguerite in the Song of the King of Thule is too dragging.
The picture quality is not the same as we have used to with more recent productions, but it's not bad either. The sound is perfectly good. It certainly isn't a top-grade production, but not nearly as bad as most reviewers would have it.",1348444800,4,2890,4.806841046277666
8083358,1,B000B8ISPA,"This visual production joins the growing list of nihilistic efforts to contaminate the soul of opera.  The tactics are familiar by now --- a first rate cast to satisfy the ear, while the stage production does all it can to destroy, for the eye and the judgment, the very  world the music and the lyrics are indicating.  The intention is to replace beauty with ugliness, and replace moral poise with various forms of collapse, and none of this in keeping with the outlook of the music.  Gounod's lovely opera has been skinned alive and salt poured into its wounds by this stage production.

Everybody agrees the singing is first rate here. It's the ugly staging and the jeering at the finer aspects of the story that is so disagreeable and repellent. With the Jewel Song, we see Marguerite (as a black garbed nun!) greedily grabbing jewels with avarice and rejoicing at the gleam added to the front of her habit, spinning around to grab for more, as if seeking a second winning lottery ticket, we lose all sense of her delicacy and quiet joy at being noticed by someone as unattainable as the dashing, young Faust. Compare this traducing of Marguerite's purity with Gounod's and, in the same vein, with Schubert's delicate song of her heart stopping when she catches just a glimpse of his noble form (""sein edler Gestalt""). Ken Russell's kidney punches never let up and the present production will surely resonate with followers of Christopher Hitchens. Unless you're a Hitchens' fan and love to see forests chopped down, be very wary.

If you really are after the music, instead of splashing out $35 for this exercise in visual nihilism, there's the advice of the earlier Amazon reviewer who suggested buying the beautiful Pretre performance on CD, with Domingo, Freni, Ghiaurov and a lively, energetic chorus that makes the rafters ring.  The complete opera is available (but pricey) and I find I'm delighted with the highlights (at a more affordable price).  The quality of the CD content is such that it puts me where I want to be.  Ciao!",1329609600,2,2041,4.7920227920227925
8083359,4,B000B8ISPA,"This production of Gounod's masterpiece was clearly not created with the intention of being perfectly traditional, and I'm sure the director was prepared to offend some viewers with this idea of his.  I purchased this DVD because I really wanted a filmed production, and this was one of the few available.  I read what a lot of other viewers said about this particular production, and I was actually intrigued by what was said.  The production certainly is different, and a few of the ideas are pretty out there.

What most people seem to dislike about this the most is the ending, but I believe they probably misunderstood it.  The booklet inside the DVD case has a synopsis, and it still says that Marguerite goes to heaven at the end.  What happens in this production is that instead of showing Marguerite's ascension to heaven, it cuts back to Faust, old again and suddenly waking up in his study from Act I.  It then shows him standing up and wandering around, as if it had all been just a dream, then he opens the coffin that was laid there at the beginning, and Marguerite's headless corpse sits up and points a finger at him, just like all the other characters had pointed a finger at her in the church scene earlier.  After this, Faust is embraced by what looks like a grim reaper, then sinks into the earth as he is dragged off to hell.  What it seems people want to see at the very end of this opera is Marguerite's ascention into heaven.  My guess is that this director figured that much was told by the music, and so Faust's fate was what should be depicted, which would be damnation.  It is a darker, more grim ending, but I have to admit, if given a chance for what it is, I'd say it's actually a decent production.  It certainly won't please everybody, but it certainly has its moments of being quite interesting.

One thing I doubt anyone will dispute about it is that the singers are wonderful.  Francisco Araiza beautifully performs the title role; I believe he is perfect for it.  He beautifully hits the high C in ""Salut, demeure, chaste et pure"", which is an impressive feat for any tenor, as far as I am concerned.  Ruggero Raimondi is a fantastic Mphistophls, as well.  I, personally, prefer the role when played by a bass-baritone rather than a deep bass, and his voice is a good fit for it, in my opinion.  There is an optional high note that I like, but he doesn't take in the first act, but I believe it is not often taken, anyway.  Gabriela Benyachkova  certainly performs the role as well as she could, and I give her credit for her input.  She certainly has a fine voice, but I personally prefer the role to be portrayed by someone smaller and/or younger.  Marguerite is depicted in the libretto by Jules Barbier and Michel Carr as a sweet, innocent little girl who has never committed sin or impurity until her encounter with Faust.  As fine a singer as she is, I believe Benyachkova is a little too old to portray it the way it was traditionally intended to be done.  When she is made a nun, though, she is more convincing as a character.  I have to admit, however, I do not particularly like to see a little boy like Siebel falling in love with a nun the way he does in this production.  As for the rest of the cast, Walton Grnroos is a very good Valentiin, and hits the high Gs beautifully

The idea of making her purity be due to the fact that she was a nun could potentially be passable, but I it isn't easy to make it work, mostly because of Siebel being in love with her, too.  I acknowledge Ken Russell's attempt, though.  It is could be interesting that Faust would end up falling in love with nun who is older, as he is still just an old doctor in a young lord's body, and perhaps the fact that she is a nun could show how Faust has it buried back in his conscience that he still believes in God and regrets what he has done.  This is could be backed up by the fact that he is rude to Mphistophls throughout the opera (constantly yelling things at him like ""Va t'en!"", which means ""Go away!""), despite the work he does as Faust's servant.

There are some traditional elements of this opera that I hate to see go, including Marguerite's traditional portrayal, but the opera certainly has its moments.  There were, however, a couple of things I admit I did not like, such as the placement of the Church Scene at the end of Act IV (after Valentin's death instead of before).  This is not the point at which it occurs in the libretto, and it is even reinforced that it should not be where it is by the fact that Act IV Scene I (which is often omitted) is included in this production (which, by the way, I found surprising and worth appreciating; a scene included that is usually not is interesting to me)  However, Marguerite says, ""I'm going to the church to pray for my child and for him"" at the end of this scene, which implies that she is going to the church after this.  This suggests that the Church scene is about to happen, and audiences do not get to hear this scene performed often, anyway.  Also, during Valentin's Death, he repeats, ""Marguerite, soit maudite!"", which Mphistophls also sings in the Church Scene on a similar musical motive.  I like it better when Valentin's is said afterward as a reference to what Marguerite heard in the church, rather than Mphistophls' being a reference to Valentin's.  The traditional placement of these scenes works better dramatically than the way done in this production, which is not very good writing.  I also found it annoying that Marguerite is executed by the guillotine.  Maybe historical accuracy was not much of a concern for the director, but it should be well-known enough that such an instrument was only used in public executions during the French Revolution.  It's too big an anachronism for me to be willing to just ignore.

Since Act IV Scene I is included, I would like to have heard Siebel's aria, ""Si Le Bonheur"", and I was disappointed not to.  However, I can forgive it's deletetion, as it usually is, anyway.  Also, in Mphistophls' ""Song of the Golden Calf"" (""Le veau d'or""), Raimondi accidentally sings the second verse twice.  This, however, would only be noticeable to an opera singer or a musician who knows the piece extremely well, and it's still well sung, so I forgive him.

It would also have been nice to see the Walpurgis Night scene, but this is rarely performed in modern productions, anyway.  I really wish the unions would not charge opera companies extra to use the house for longer; if it weren't for this, it would be possible for them to give longer productions, which might allow such scenes to be included.  The Walpurgis Night scene is referenced in the recitative immediately proceeding Mphistophls' serenade, and it is a fine sounding piece of music; I really wish I could see a production in which it would be included.  Perhaps it may seem like a financial risk, but I believe that it would be a good idea to do it if a production is being filmed.  People would much rather have more scenes to watch on a DVD that are not usually performed.

Overall, this production is good enough to get a 4/5 from me.  It's not perfect, and it's certainly not exactly what everyone wants to see when they go to see Gounod's amazing work that was once the most frequently performed opera in all of Europe, but for what it is, it has it's good points, and I can find plenty of things about it that deserve to be appreciated.",1287014400,14,7445,4.485163204747774
8083360,3,B000B8ISPA,"I am trying really hard to like this, and I am sure the actual stage production was utterly mindblowing (I managed to see Russell's ""Madama Butterfly"" in Charleston, SC many moons ago, and it was quite a feast of the senses), but I can't help but think that the video production (directed by Ken Russell, no less) is quite erratic and makes very little sense!  Or, maybe it was that the stage was super-packed with character and action (I do recall alot of movement in the ""Madama Butterfly"" production) and it was darn near impossible for the camera to pick out any discernable detail.  I won't give away any plot details (what little I could discern) except to say that the ending camera shot left me totally bewildered.  Was the audience seeing the same thing?  Did Ken Russell actually miss the ""money"" shot when he was videotaping?  Huh?

[Beginning of original review]
(I'm sometimes quite late with my reviews, perhaps because I wanted to process what I'd viewed.  Also, am correcting typos I made, because of passion when typing the first version of this review.  Furthermore, usually I'd give a classic some four or five stars, but in this case, I must speak, because I never saw such direction like Ken Russell's; he detracts from the work of exquisite performers.)

During spring and summer, I watched this rendition of Gounod's ""Faust"" several times.  Glad that I also bought one of the other versions, and that the other (nicer) version of Gounod's ""Faust"" (Nicolai Ghiaurov as ""Mephisto"" and Renata Scotto as ""Marguerite"") arrived shortly afterward.

This (Ken Russell's direction) was the first one shipped to me.  WHEN I SAW THE ENDING, ESPECIALLY WITH MARGUERITE BEING RE-ANIMATED AS A HEADLESS GHOUL AND DENIED HER ENTRY INTO HEAVEN, -- I -- WAS -- CURSING -- WITH -- ANGER -- !!!!  (I remember at least screaming ""DAMN IT!"" out loud!)  How could the ending be like that?!

It's not the fault of Ruggero Raimondi.  This is the first opera that featured Raimondi (and my first ""Faust"") that I ever bought, and he was awesome.  His interpretation of Mephistopheles was magnificent, and that scene with him gobbling a ""wooden"" cross that turned out to actually be made of chocolate, was a rather cute scene.  There's nothing wrong with Raimondi.

(I also remember one of the soldier-guys doing a really good job.  He's the one with the craggy cheeks, and you can see the passion in his eyes at the end of ""Le Veau D'Or"" / Rondo of the Golden Calf.)

In fact, there's nothing wrong with any of the other singers, musicians, actors, dancers, or performers.  They all did a pretty good job, considering their circumstances (such as being directed by Ken Russell!).

I'm directly blaming Ken Russell -- there seems to be something seriously wrong with Ken Russell.  Why wouldn't you stick to the canon (tradition), Kenny-boy?!

I've written a few fan-fiction short-stories about a couple of movies and some prime-time TV shows -- and enjoyed reading several or many fanfictions written by others.  In fanfiction, we have a word: ""CANON""

If you deliberately disregard the canon of a given fictional or legendary story, then you must label your story as ""AU"" or ""A.U."" -- in other words, Alternate Universe.  If your Alternate-Universe writing be good, then people will like it; if it sucks, then it sucks, and people will know it.

Some ""AU""/Alternative-Universe fanfics are actually quite good; there's something emotionally / intellectually / morally / aesthetically satisfying about them.  In other words, on several levels, they work.

DIRECTING AN OPERA IS IN SOME WAYS LIKE WRITING FANFICTION: WHAT YOU'RE DOING, AS A DIRECTOR, IS DERIVATIVE, AND IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO BE SURE THAT YOUR DIRECTION DOES NOT CAST THE OPERA IN A BAD LIGHT.

(Renata Scotto said as much in an interview that went with the Ghiaurov video disk.)

KEN RUSSELL'S ALTERNATE-UNIVERSE INTERPRETATION OF GOUNOD'S FAUST IS NEEDLESSLY MEAN AND NASTY, AND THE ENDING WITH MARGUERITE IS ESPECIALLY DISAPPOINTING.  WHAT, DOES THIS GUY HATE WOMEN, OR IS HE A GRADE-SCHOOL DROP-OUT WHO HATES CLASSIC STORIES SUCH AS THE ""FAUST"" LEGEND?? (Maybe I should google ""Ken Russell"" again, but I think he probably hates women -- and if the more attractive a woman is, then the more malevolent Russell tends to be towards her; just my honest guess.)

KEN RUSSELL'S VIEW OF THE ""FAUST"" UNIVERSE IS AN ALTERNATE UNIVERSE THAT IS RIDDLED WITH HOPELESS -- AND I MEAN HOPELESS -- EVIL !! THERE'S NO HOPE OF ANY SORT OF REDEMPTION IN HIS VERSION OF THE STORY!  WHAT GIVES?!

Russell had essentially taken an brilliant and exquisite opera and dumbed it down to a mediocre production in which Russell's own evil vision is offset only by the beauty of the performers.  THE PERFORMERS (INCLUDING RAIMONDI AND THE CRAGGY-FACED SOLDIER-GUY) ALL RULE; IT'S KEN RUSSELL WHO SUCKS!

I'm inclined to watch it again for the sake of the performers (especially for the handsome Raimondi and that favorite soldier of mine) -- and NOT for the sake of Ken Russell's direction!

I suspect that the directors of the Weiner Staatsoper, when they allowed Russell to direct ""Faust"" for them, were presenting ""Faust"" in an opera house with a curse upon it: a curse named Ken Russell.

(If you don't mind my imitation ""Erik"" joke.)

Fortunately, the lovely performers did well to offset the ugliness of Ken Russell's curse.  So, ultimately, this version of Gounod's ""Faust"" gets three stars instead of the more typical four or five that it would usually deserve.

Oh, and: why did Russell turn Marguerite into a nun (before eventually turning her into a headless re-animated ghoul)?  Just because she was a very devoutly religious girl, or (for that matter) virginal (before Faust did her), does not mean that she was a nun.  Ken Russell is just full of B.S. in equating both virginity and religious devotion with nunnery (and he was revealing his famous fetish for combining sex and nuns -- as I later on learned by googling the name ""Ken Russell"")!  Dr. Faust might have screwed up Marguerite's life, but Ken Russell screwed up the entire story with his very poorly done Alternate-Universe interpretation of Gounod's opera.  Ken Russell, please don't detract from a great opera or from wonderful performers ever again!

Three stars, instead of four or five, for very obvious reasons (read:an arrogant director named Ken Russell).

Dr. Faust might have screwed up Marguerite's life, but Ken Russell screwed up their story!

And I'd watch this opera only for the sake of the MANY GOOD PERFORMERS who were working with a bad director (the performers were doing what they could).

Thanks to Russell's bad direction, three stars!  [End of original review]

....

EDIT:  On second thought, am going to give this video one (1) star (changing it from the original three stars), thanks to that brat named Ken Russell.  The performers were doing what they could, and they deserve credit -- but KENNY BOY REALLY BLEW THIS OPERA WITH HIS TERRIBLE DIRECTION.  There really is a curse on the opera world, and that curse is bad directors such as Ken Russell!",1253577600,5,6642,4.912028725314183
