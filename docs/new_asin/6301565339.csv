7812495,4,6301565339,"Yet another great animated TV series that's under appreciated by distributors and creators why? I liked it, and I'm sure that a lot of other kids and adults would still enjoy this series if only creators, and distributors would just lighten up and work something out so people can again enjoy great cartoons like this one

I hope that one day very soon that Noozles, and Grimms fairy tale classics will be released on DVD, and given the proper respect that they deserve

It seems strange that an animated series that was once on main stream cable TV and loved by thousands would not get released on DVD all over as it should be

But to those of you who don't care what format the series is in and just want to see Noozles again you might wanna hurry, and get this because who knows how long the VHS will even be available gee! sigh! makes no sense that so many other cartoon classics are on DVD but not this one.",1316390400,2,912,4.321637426900585

Centered around a girl named Sandy and her 2 koala friends it very neat! It's also very original and I remember  many things from it and most of all that the bottom line is......it's good  TV!",964569600,6,304,4.298245614035087
