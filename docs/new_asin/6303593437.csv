7851531,4,6303593437,"The great Max Ophuls made this brilliant, if slightly uncertain, 1934 classic in Italy during his exile from Germany. Part of what makes this passionate study of a failing movie actress (exceptionally performed by Isa Miranda) truly remarkable is the way it prefigures Ophuls' later and more superior work. The flashback sequences that reveal the heroine's sordid past become more elaborate in ""Lola Montes"" and the spoiled, narcissistic stature of the actress paves the way for Danielle Darrieux's spoiled socialite Louise De in the crowning masterwork, ""Madame de""! Fascinatingly, however, ""La Signora di Tutti"", though it has some awesome camera movements, somehow lacks the exquisite, sensuous, free-flowing camera work of ""Letter from an Unknown Woman"", ""La Ronde"" ""Le Plaisir"", ""Madame de"" and ""Lola Montes""! Still, it is a great work and should be an excellent introduction to the films of one of cinema's original masters.",982800000,2,930,5.4206896551724135
