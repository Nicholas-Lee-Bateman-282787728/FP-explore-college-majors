8229023,4,B000XPXTGY,"The filmmaker Dhruvesh Zaveri must have a love of giallo; he certainly has a fascination with the color red. Red is about a young artist who is unable to paint with the color red; the sight of red paint triggers a panic attack that fades into a lingering anxiety that makes it impossible for her to continue her work. She locks herself in her apartment in a frenzy of fear, then throws open the door and gate in a claustrophobic burst of adrenaline. Alone in the night, she finds the remains of an old house. Spirits seem to shriek and slip past her in the dark. A dream-like fugue ensues, using interesting cinematic techniques and primary color, also reminiscent of giallo cinema.

Red is an interesting exploration of the artist and the ways in which the artist may come to know themselves through their work, for better or worse.",1291852800,,833,4.590604026845638
