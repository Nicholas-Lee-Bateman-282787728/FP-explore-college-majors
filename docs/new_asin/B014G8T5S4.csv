8730659,5,B014G8T5S4,Dovid Meyer is an inspirational Jewish film. The movie is a Ba'al Teshuva (Returning to G-d/Religion) movie about loving G-d even when life does not turn out the way we want it to. The film shows how G-d is always there for us in our time of need even if we do not see it at the time. In the darkest of hours G-d is there for us. G-d does not pull away from us- we pull away from G-d. The film shows us sometimes G-d has other plans for us. The movie is sweet and the whole family can watch it.,1497139200,,494,3.8529411764705883

8730661,5,B014G8T5S4,"Had a group of friends over for dinner and a movie Dovid Meyer was incredible.  It had something for everyone. We smiled with joy and tenderness  There were brief moments of tears but even those had a softness to them. We also shared a great deal of laughter.  Everyone wanted to know when it wold be out in theaters.  The young boy who starred in the role of Dovid Meyer enchanted us all.  From the title you would think it would appeal to those of the jewish faith,  but it was a movie that touched us all .  This was very inspiring and in times as these it gave us a very uplifting spirit.  Very highly recommended.",1446249600,6,618,4.222222222222222
