5317311,5,B009D4GV7A,"Familiar with this series from pre-video days when they were first created. The combination of music, exceptional casting of voice actors and the animation made these so enjoyable we wanted to share them with grandchild. When they appeared in DVD we wanted to buy our favorites from the set.",1391126400,,291,4.959183673469388
5317312,4,B009D4GV7A,"I had this on VHS for my kids when they were young and they got this biggest charge out of it.  Maybe I am a little more open than others on this, but I felt it was most appropriate for kids.  It just shows the silliness in people.",1384128000,2,231,3.7916666666666665
5317313,1,B009D4GV7A,"As a child, I loved the old tale of Pecos Bill, and I was super excited to show it to my children. However, I was VERY upset about the nudity (Bill's behind). I had to turn it off because I had other people's children watching it along with me. Shame on me for not watching it beforehand!",1367107200,,288,4.0701754385964914

5317333,5,B009D4GV7A,Bought for my Dad because he had the book and record as a boy when he had typhoid fever.  They'd had a flood in their town and he accidentally got a full dose of the typhoid vaccine and he was just a little boy.  Thought he'd like hearing again even though he heard it over and over as a boy!  They didn't have the entertainment we have today!,1410134400,2,343,4.014705882352941
