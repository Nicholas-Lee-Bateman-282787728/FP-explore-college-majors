4046576,4,B0030U1TUW,"What do you get when you put together an orderly during WWII, a professional eater, and a taxidermist?  Well, I'll tell you.  You get a concoction of grotesque imagery, hilarious situations and a strong need for a shower.  This is a story about a very strange Hungarian family over the course of three generations.  A disturbing film with a lot of dark comedy ""Taxidermia"" also provides an intelligent commentary on the lengths humans take with their obsessions of the body.

""Taxidermia"" is director Gyrgy Plfi second feature film following the highly unique ""Hukkle"".  Plfi takes a more discomforting turn in this outing but keeps the dark humor he showcased in his first feature.  This film has it's ""WTF"" moments, but in the end it is a well made film with some unforgettable scenes and a successfully artsy ending.

""Taxidermia"" is film about three generations of Hungarians.  First, an orderly during WWII who is abused and mistreated.  During a night of insanity he fathers an illegitimate son who ends up being raised by the orderly's Lieutenant.  The son grows to be a champion in the sport of speed eating, a sport that is on the brink of epicness it seems.  Finally the speed eater marries and produces a skinny pale son who grows to be a skilled taxidermist.  We witness the psychosis of the orderly, the gluttony of speed eating and finally the beauty of the taxidermist.  Be prepared to laugh, puke, laugh and puke a little more.

Visually the film is remarkable.  Cinematographer Gergely Pohrnok returns from ""Hukkle"" providing excellent camera transitions and some unique ""crane"" shots.  Veronika Merlin's art direction is also wonderful, the set pieces and costumes were very impressive and lent to the films gloomy yet comedic undertones.  Along with the photography the music was phenomenal.  Scored primarily by electronic artist Amon Tobin, I would say the music was the highlight for me.

Make no mistake about it, ""Taxidermia"" is a difficult watch.  Most probably won't even get through the first sequence.  But with an open mind and an understanding of where this film is coming from it can be a very enjoyable experience.  The mixture of troubling visuals, intelligent inner commentary and family relationship lessons makes this an easy recommendation for me.

I look forward to more from director Gyrgy Plfi.  I've enjoyed his first two films and know that his uniqueness will bring forth even more depraved yet intelligent films in the future.",1300838400,2,2470,4.995098039215686
4046577,3,B0030U1TUW,"After seeing clips of Taxidermia on YouTube, I thought I had found a really powerful (if somewhat tasteless) movie. Unfortunately, it turns out that most of the best parts were those clips. The story of three generations starts out strong enough (think Wozzeck), but quickly deteriorates;  the ending is a unsuccessful attempt to be shocking for the sake of being shocking. Rent, but don't buy.

The soundtrack (by Amon Tobin) is another matter entirely: excellent!",1290556800,,465,5.1866666666666665
4046578,3,B0030U1TUW,"This is a mordant, darkly comic tale of obsession spanning three generations. Captivating in its grossness, this is definitely not one for the squeamish. It's difficult to divine exactly what this movie is supposed to tell us, if it's attempting to tell us anything at all. The characters are uniformly grotesque, the plot is slight, and any possible meaning is distinctly nebulous. Palfi appeals to the viewer's voyeuristic tendencies and, it has to be said, not much else. But as a study of bodily compulsions it's interesting enough.",1258848000,6,536,5.1022727272727275
4046579,4,B0030U1TUW,"Taxidermia (Gyorgy Palfi, 2006)

Much has been made of the weird factor in Gyorgy Palfi's Taxidermia; I'm not sure whether it says more about the film or about me that I didn't see anything terribly out of the ordinary until the last ten minutes or so. There certainly wasn't anything weirder than one might find in an average John Waters movie until then. So why all the hate-on for what is, when it comes right down to it, a clever and well-crafted family drama, what might happen were, say, Dusan Makavejev to team up with Alexander Mackendrick to film a version of Jeffrey Archer's Kane and Abel, except about the lower-rent portions of society? (And yes, those who have been following my review for a very long time will know the accord I give all three of those artists, and yes, I'm placing Palfi in the same stratum.) Given my lack of weirdness-perception, the question then becomes, is it a good movie for someone who doesn't recognize the weird? Go back and reread the sentence before the question, and I think you'll already know where I stand on the issue. But my job is to review things, not just tell you how great they are. So I must keep typing, and you, dear reader, must keep reading.

Taxidermia tells the story of three generations of a dysfunctional Hungarian family. Grandfather, whose name is Vendel Morosgovanyi (Csaba Czene), is a low-ranking soldier during World War II who likes spying on the camp women when they bathe. This leads--though not at all in the natural way--to the birth of a son, Kalman Balatony (Gergely Trocsanyi), who, thanks to his upbringing, becomes a competitive eater in the seventies. He, in turn, marries the female competitive eating champion and the two of them have a son, Oreg (Gabor Mate), a taxidermist in contemporary Hungary. Needless to say I'm skipping over the details; the spoilerific nature of the film has little to do with its plot and everything to do with the details of the lives of these three men and those around them.

Not that there's actually much to spoil here. This isn't a movie whose story lends itself to a great deal of suspense; it is spectacle, in the grand meaning of that term. It shows us what we already know. (For some reason, from here I want to draw a comparison to Cecil B. DeMille's biblical epics. I am resisting the temptation.) It does so in notable, and somewhat extreme ways; while I'm not willing to go as far as weird (and certainly not as far as shocking), these aren't images one sees on film all that often. (And yet there is very little here one didn't see in Bela Tarr's Satantango, which is probably also a telling comparison, at least as to how my head works.) If you're going into it without really knowing much about the imagery, then I should probably caution you that the movie does contain some things, simulated or no, which some folks might find offensive, including animal slaughter, male full frontal nudity, and the consumption of forty-five kilos of red caviar in twenty minutes. I leave it to the prospective viewer to decide which of those is more offensive (and I've left out a choice item or two to prevent this review from being redlined). Still, I recommend the movie unreservedly, given that it manages to combine a slow pace and a gripping narrative, something that very few films are able to do successfully. I believe Palfi has a bright future in the film industry. (Someone in Hungary obviously agrees with me, as Taxidermia was Hungary's entry in the 2008 Best Foreign Film category at the Academy Awards, and deservedly so.) ****",1233964800,14,3559,4.682108626198083

8386014,5,B0030U1TUW,"The truth is, you can't love the human body without at some point embracing the yucky stuff. This movie is all about the yucky stuff. At an early age I observed that Peter Jackson's Dead Alive was a movie that reveled in every available opportunity to expose the human body's function at its ugliest, its most grotesque, its most revolting. Of course, Gyrgi Plfi's Taxidermia goes far beyond that, because while Jackson was telling primarily a zombie story, Plfi is telling a story of human bodies, and their sins. This movie, rooted deeply in Hungarian culture and politics, tells the stories of three bodies, a grandfather, a father, and a son. The grandfather is a soldier in WWII, a hare-lipped pervert who gets killed after sleeping with and impregnating his superior's wife. The baby grows up to be a competitive eater, full of promise but, like Tom Cruise's Maverick, destined to always take second place. And his son is a taxidermist, driven to somehow transcend his family, his country, and his own limited existence. And then one day a doctor comes in with a taxidermy job that is almost unspeakable....",1403395200,,1113,4.863157894736842

8386018,3,B0030U1TUW,"If you enjoy fantasy styles films that depict a world far stranger than your own, leaving you to ask the universe ""WHAT THE F#@& DID I JUST WITNESS"", the you'll certainly find enough entertainment value in this film for it to be worth watching once.  Or perhaps you're simply trying to explore new territory in foreign and/or independent cinema, in which case, you may also find Taxidermia to be worth an hour-and-a-half of your time.

I would NOT recommend this movie to the casual, Sunday-evening film watcher.  If you're even a little squeamish or frequently turn away from disgusting movie scenes; ever walked away from a conversation that suggested something slightly taboo; or simply aren't interested in things you don't fully understand, then this film is probably not for you.

First, understand that I love ""dark, weird and twisted"" for creativity's sake.  This movie takes that to an entirely new level... and beyond.  The visuals are very striking, and--among other things--will grab your attention right from the start.

Taxidermia is about the lives of three [strange] men over the course of three generations.  The story segues from one life to the next without any real substance to tie them together.  It feels more like three short films with disparate story lines, neither of which has a true plot other than to present itself as... strange.

I found the first chapter of the film to be quite thought provoking.  It pulls the viewer into a dark and disgusting world, wandering where the writer will take the story next, and keeps one excited to find out... it's too strange not to be at least a little intrigued.  The problem is, I found that the rest of the movie tends to get more disgusting as it progresses, where the story line quickly tapers off.  Again, I enjoy strange and disgusting in a film, but there needs to be substance behind the idea.  I felt the story played out like several unfinished thoughts, then some how concluded like you just walked in on the wrong part--or end of--what was probably an oddly intriguing conversation.",1328918400,4,2063,4.857142857142857
