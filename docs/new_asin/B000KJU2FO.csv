8157405,5,B000KJU2FO,"If you are studying Kenpo, this will help you to jog your memory when practicing.  It is meant to be used by a student who has an instructor.",1441843200,,141,4.035714285714286
8157406,3,B000KJU2FO,"this was a gift, I haven't seen the recipient in any ppv UFC events yet.. so I am guessing there is a more advanced book required",1369353600,,129,4.0
8157407,5,B000KJU2FO,This is a great dvd but as it says it is for the more advanced practitioner for it does show the more complicated techniches for the kempo karate system this dvd includes Katas pinans demos of the techniches 10 point blocks statue of the crane and combinations for diffrent levels really recommend it especially for the price u have nothing to lose,1340236800,,348,4.629032258064516
8157408,1,B000KJU2FO,"So, I recently ordered this disc, and the Advanced copy as well, and I must say. No.
I cannot even look at these forms, It really upset me overall the way these forms were
being done. I practice two martial arts, Shotokan and Kenpo. Shotokan practices these
particular kata, while my variation of Kenpo does not. But I must say, each form was
done poorly and was not executed in a manner akin to Kenpo. (I was very nice here.)

Next, I'll give you some positives. The Instructor in the disc says to only use the
disc to jog your memory of what you already know, and not to learn from it. He's right,
please don't. Secondly, it's super cheap, and I am sure this is why. You get what you
pay for overall.

For good good Kenpo, especially if your staying away from Ed Parker Kenpo, research
Ultimate Kempo by: Jeff Driscol. I found this to be and excellent resource for me.",1335657600,,870,4.331288343558282
8157409,1,B000KJU2FO,"I studied Kenpo in a dojo (AA Universal) for 2 years and this didn't resemble anything I learned. First, the instructor explained how you don't have to worry if you can't kick someone's face, you'll simply kick them in the groin and he'll bend over, the next kata starts with a kick over his head. Also, he never explains the basics, like the difference between a reverse punch, a straight punch, any kick or even the fact that every strike is a block and every block is a strike. I could spend all day telling you what's wrong with the DVD, let's just say ""save your money"". I also purchased the DVDs by rank, yellow, orange, purple and blue, those were much better. You're much better off with the latter than the former.",1315785600,5,723,4.443609022556391
8157410,2,B000KJU2FO,"They show you a lot of basic forms, but the instructors don't seem that into it, and the recording is super low budget and low quality.",1313452800,3,135,4.230769230769231
8157411,5,B000KJU2FO,"If you are a student of kenpo karate, you will not regret purchasing this DVD.  Your progress will accelerate.  You will be able to review before classes.  Katas and Pinans that seemed complicated will be easy to learn.  Why? Because you can use the pause button on your remote to break the kata or pinan or combination down into easy to learn segments.

When you get this DVD, you will want the second in the series.  If you are a serious student you will appreciate what a find this DVD is.  James Bouchard is a fantastic instructor. You get an advanced student showing the kata or pinan then James Bouchard explains and demonstrates move by move.  When he shows the combinations, he shows it ""in the air"" then mirror view then with a student punching in.

These DVDs are the reason, I am confident that I will earn my black belt someday!!!",1311033600,,842,4.4868421052631575
