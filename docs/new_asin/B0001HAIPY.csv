2002896,1,B0001HAIPY,"I really can't express how much I disliked this movie. It came to me highly recommended, so perhaps I went into it with high expectations, but I was definitely underwhelmed.

The story is about two young Irish men who move to London looking for fame and fortune and instead find themselves hustling older gay men to survive. During the course of their work, they inadvertently stumble over a murdered ""Queen""--the first dead gay guy. They then find themselves caught up in a caper to discover the rumored ""bed of bread"", a bed supposedly stuffed with cash. In the process, they leave a trail of dead gay men in their wake.

The already anemic plot is stretched so thin that at times it practically disappears. The film is populated by a series of grossly stereotyped characters, but at least it's an equal opportunity offender--everyone from Jews, to Arabs, to little people, to blacks, to lesbians, to gay men can be disgusted by their portrayals in this schlock fest.

The movie sells itself as a hilarious British comedy, but I didn't find myself laughing once as I suffered through the full eighty-four minutes. Comparisons to John Waters are only valid if they refer to his more recent (and foul) offerings such as ""A Dirty Shame"".

If you enjoy tasteless jokes and stereotyping, then you may enjoy this movie. If you prefer subtlety, smart humor, good acting, competent direction, or intelligent writing, look elsewhere.",1098230400,9,1426,4.904564315352697

2002898,4,B0001HAIPY,"NINE DEAD GAY GUYS is a hoot!  Director/Writer Ky Mo Lab has concocted a tale of two Irish lads (Byron played by Brendan Mackey and Kenny played by Glenn Mulhern) who have come to London to find the 'streets paved with gold' and instead find that the only way to support their wayward habits of drinking and bumming off others is to play the gay pub route, making money giving sexual favors in the johns.  In this dubious line of work they encounter the subterfuge of London's seamy side and come upon a murder that has to do with 'Queen' (Michael Praed), an Orthodox Jew named Golder's Green (Simon Godley) who is obsessed with 'size'9 (a fact which eventually leads to the path of the man directly and indirectly responsible for the deaths of nine gay guys), and a supporting commedia dell'arte bunch of oddballs.  The cast of highly original and hilarious characters includes a Lesbian pub owner Iron Lady (Karen Sharman), a cab driver Dick-Cheese Deepak (Abdala Keserwani), a dwarf (Raymond Griffith), and others.  The photography is appropriately smarmy, the sets and production design are some of the best color manipulation you'll find anywhere, the musical score fits the plot, and the use of over titles at the right moments punctuates the comic book atmosphere of the piece.  Excellent acting from everyone involved, a spiky and uproariously funny script and a general sense of great British satire make this film about what could be construed to be a shady topic simply an all out good time to watch. And there is even a touch of tenderness at the ending, which makes a major statement about corporal vs. spiritual love.  Excellent!",1092960000,24,1643,4.829181494661921

Yes, some of the humor comes from the gay factor and maybe its ultimate successs is the fact that there could be interchangable 9 Dead ___  Guys, but it still doesn't amount to too much.

2002901,2,B0001HAIPY,"Nine Dead Gay Guys is an interesting little film.  I don't know that I would qualify it as pure farce or pure dark comedy, but it quite well could be a mix of both.  Unfortunately, it never rises above silliness in its attempt at humor, leaving the viewer wondering where the laughter is.
Straight Irish lad Kenny follows his also straight mate Byron to London upon Byron's assurance that he's gotten lucrative employment.  Much to Kenny's chagrin, there is no job, Byron was lying.  Byron lives as a squatter in an abandoned building drinking himself blind and earning money to pay for it by providing sexual services to the men at the local gay pub.
Shortly, Kenny gets sucked into the whole ""gay for pay"" scheme.
The plot revolves around Kenny and Byron trying to hunt down a supposed stash of cash in the bed of a gay man called ""The Queen"".  However, as they move on their merry way to find the money they accidentally leave behind a trail of dead bodies.
All of this could have been much funnier if the script and direction had been tighter.  The lead actors are up to the task and are quite likable and talented.  However, the sum of the parts does not provide a really cohesive storyline.
It's really just a fair film that could have faired better, I think, with a stronger hand directing the action and a more competent hand at editing.
Pleasant, but not really worth bothering.",1087948800,13,1387,4.546184738955823
2002902,4,B0001HAIPY,"Young Irishman Kenny decides to follow in the footsteps of his best mate Byron, who left to make his fortune in the big city -- London.  He finds Byron shacked up in an abandoned building, but worse, he learns that his best mates been earning his money not in some blue-collar trade but as a hustler at the local gay bar.  In spite of this, Kenny decides to stay on with his mate and soon finds himself drawn Byron's life, as his money quickly runs out.
But things take an unusual turn when words spreads that The Queen has been murdered.  Stories abound about a hidden trove of cash tucked away in the gigantic bed she shared with her lover, Golders Green, an Orthodox Jew.  Determined to find the money, they set off around London in search of Golders' house, leaving a trail of accidental deaths, a desparate dwarf, and Kenny discovering the truth about himself.
Writer/Director Ky Mo Lab's first film is irreverant, ballsy, campy and just plain fun.  The dialogue is sharp and funny, and delivered incredibly well by all the actors.  Glen Mulhern and Brendan Mackey are wonderful as the duo of Kenny and Byron.  They come across as genuine friends, willing to help one another out in a pinch.  The featured actors are equally fine, including Vas Blackwood, Steven Berkoff, Michael Praed, and Karen Sharman.  But, Raymond Griffiths almost steals the entire movie as The Desparate Dwarf who only wants someone to have sex with him.
The movie doesn't take itself too seriously, which makes it even more enjoyable.  A great film that will have you laughing out loud.",1086048000,13,1566,4.7032967032967035
2002903,3,B0001HAIPY,"Word of warning: if you are even the slightest bit offendable, this movie is not for you. Everyone is a target here. Gays, Jews, blacks, the elderly, short people, lesbians, not one topic is sacred.
That said, this off the wall sex farce has its moments, but never quite gels into anything memorable. The plot, such as it is, revolves around two London club drinkers (Kenny and Bryon) who are willing to go down on the locals in a gay bar for drink money, all the while insisting that they aren't gay. (Or are they?) Then comes the news that one of the regulars is dead, and the intimations that there is a substantial amount of cash hidden somewhere the property of one of his regular tricks. Naturally, the men who find it first are going to be the collectors. But not before 8 more dead gay guys make their way into the picture for different silly reasons. Problem is, these characters are rushed in and out of the movie so quickly that you may never get a clue as to what their function is other than to become the punch line of a tasteless joke.
Ultimately, ""9 Dead Gay Guys"" is more bark than bite. If there had been a little more attention to developing this into more than a couple of obvious naughty laughs, it could have been so much funnier. Not like tastelessness is a problem with the movie, the whole design is to BE without taste and offend as many folks as quickly as possible. Now if all that sounds appealing to you, you'll probably enjoy the movie and its running gags about sex, gays, death, drinking and the Really Hard Red Bull Test. Of which Kenny may just be the one man who can pass, in more ways than one.",1082764800,5,1631,4.350819672131148

But there's no sense in bashing a movie that warns you ahead of time.  So sit back, relax, and take it for what it is; a humerous comedy of Britain's underbelly.

2002955,2,B0001HAIPY,"Story: 2 Irish straight friends meet in the London slums. One teaches the other how to earn some money by doing sexual favors to old queens until they get involved in a bizarre quest for a supposed mattress full of money that a villainous queen guarded until his death in his London urban castle. Little by little the way to the apparent gold is paved with the bodies of dead gay guys that they accidentally kill or are killed accidentally.

I tried to laugh but every time I was ready to do so I got disappointed with the ever-increasing number of gay stereotypes that this mostly straight casting performed from beginning to end. And by that time I was stranded with a movie that only used gay stereotyped characters as an excuse to try to painfully push the plot further. I gave 2 stars however not because of the kindergarten plot, or the lousy acting but because it was so funny to see so many straight men (some of them are talented actors with a huge background) give in to what they understand would an actual queen behave (you know... without liking it *too much* just like the 2 Irish characters). So the movie is as funny as your straight buddies' dull homophobic jokes.

Noneteheless, the grimaces from Steven Berkoff, the delicate manners of Michael Praed's character, the crazy silent running around of Fish and the ferocious thumping of Karen Shaman's the Iron Lady are some of the unforgettable moments from this movie.

2002963,2,B0001HAIPY,"Nine Dead Gay Guys (Lab Ky Mo, 2002)

Nine Dead Gay Guys is an otherwise amusing film that suffers from the single worst sound transfer I've ever encountered on a DVD, and I've watched a whole lot of low-budget DVDs over the years.

The story concerns Byron (Touching the Void's Brendan Mackey) and his best friend Kenny (character actor Glen Mulhern) traversing their way through a small segment of the London gay underground. Kenny has come over from Ireland to visit Byron, and has no idea of what Byron does in London to earn money. When he finds out, he's initially disgusted, but ends up falling right into it with Jeff (Steven Berkoff of War and Remembrance, Absolute Beginners, The Krays, etc.), one of Byron's favorite tricks. The problem is, everywhere Kenny goes, gay guys turn up, well, dead. Add in a subplot about an orthodox Jew who goes under the alias Golders Green (Simon Godley, a regular minor character on Alias Smith and Jones) with a bedful of money, and you've got a comedy.

Well, okay, you've got a mishmash of stereotypes. But it does contain some genuinely funny moments, some of them possibly unintentional (for example, the Desperate Dwarf, played by Raymond Griffiths, looks way too much like Graham Norton for the casting to be a coincidence). Ultimately, it could have been a mindless, amusing piece of tripe well worth whiling away an evening.

But then comes the sound transfer.

By now, I'm sure we're all well aware that there has yet to be a DVD made, at least in my experience, that has a proper sound transfer. To a one, the music is far too loud, and the voices are far too soft. Nine Dead Gay Guys takes it to extremes, forcing the viewer to turn the sound up almost to the maximum when there's nothing but voice and ambient sound, resulting in deafening blasts of music on regular occasions. It's hideous. I've heard better sound transfer on public-domain flicks from fly-by-night companies. ** (half a point knocked off for horrible sound transfer).",1101686400,6,1993,4.7485549132947975
