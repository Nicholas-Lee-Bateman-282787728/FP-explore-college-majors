Now I will admit this is one of those so bad it's good type of movies BUT it is not a good movie.  Very very poor direction!  Some examples:

1.  It's cool when Mickey Rourke gets strangled early on. What is not cool is when four minutes later he is sitting 'dead' under a table and he takes a noticeable breath(his stomach rises!) Actually I love this screw up but it is poor direction or editing or something.

2.  It's cool when Gina Gershon gets killed.  What is not cool is when she lays there dead and her left eye switches! Ha! She is trying to act dead and couldn't hold it. Apparently the director does not know how to do dead people.

3.  Total frontal nudity at Billy's apartment is cool but has nothing to do with the plot and is a reflection of an unimaginative filmmaker.

4.  Split screens and multiple split screens are used excessively and with no point at times other to look 'cool'. Very amateurish presentation.

5.  Background music is unimaginative, contrived.  B film and less type fodder.

6.  I love Juliet Lewis but she comes off speaking French very unnaturally. It sounds like she just learned how to speak it.  Funny to listen to but it is obvious it is NOT her native tongue.

So, I love this movie because it is so bad!  :)  It fails miserably!",1289174400,2,1469,4.366666666666666
1870808,5,B00008Z45X,"This movie was extremely different, and very well acted! Gina Gershon is the best as she always is, and Juliette Lewis ( who only speaks french in this film) is superb as usual. Very entertaining, and well worth watching!",1213315200,3,221,4.6923076923076925
1870809,5,B00008Z45X,"Far from previous narrative conventionalisms, this movie accents the memory weight around a very wounded and disillusioned woman who had a sudden love affair with an artist of the photography. But love hurts, specially when you give more than you receive. So in this state of things a very well puzzled script will lead us to presence an admirable crossroad, visibly remarked over and over with the poster of that unforgettable Noir titled: ""Criss cross"" that alludes the tensional state of Claire, cheated, haunted and supposedly murder `s suspect.

Juliette Lewis gave a jarring performance as this distorted mind woman without present and not even dreams of future; Gina Gershon as the cold blood woman and Mickey Rourke in a brief appearance of just fifteen minutes on screen make of this work a very recommended option at the moment to consider among the most interesting thrillers made that year. I would like you to notice you the related link with a cult movie from the Eighties: Diva.",1143072000,7,993,4.946107784431137
1870810,5,B00008Z45X,"Twist the night away!

Wanna watch a murder thriller with all the twists and

turns?  ""Picture Claire"" is just for you?  Starring

Juliette Lewis as ""Claire"", this Indy flick has all

the ingredients of a mystery mogul compacted in 90

minutes of fun, mystique, romance and release...in the

form of ""relief"".

Co-stars Gina Gershon and Callum Keith Rennie fill

this movie with solidity and character only they could

cast (and portray).

Juliette has always been tops on my list.  After her

roles in ""Natural Born Killers"", ""Kalifornia"" and

""Strange Days"" (not to mention her childhood role as

Audrey in Christmas Vacation), JL is a quality

actress.

I really don't want to give away any of the plot, but

the title refers to a picture (photograph) of Claire.

Nothing more from me.  It's worth a rental, or a

purchase.  It's also worth a 5 on the murder mystery

genre.",1114300800,9,877,4.77027027027027
1870811,4,B00008Z45X,"Finding this in a $3.99 cut-out section, I picked it up figuring it was worth lunch money to watch Gina Gershon for 91 minutes. What I got was a lot more - a swiftly paced race through the back streets of Toronto (the most beautiful city in North America) and clever acting, fine direction and very interesting editing effects. The director and technical crew really made an effort to create something unique and it shows. It's forgettable and it won't change your life, but it's a great popcorn movie in the dark. Shame it wasn't filmed in black and white, it's a cool little film noire piece, well worth your time. Juliette Lewis is very good as a cornered, not too bright little barfly pickup, and it's a kick to watch her make stupid move after stupider move. Gina Gershon is superb as just the opposite, a street smart, ruthless, no nonsense criminal type. Don't ever let her sit on your lap, as you'll see in the first few minutes of the film. Someday some of these clowns in Hollywood will see that Gershon is a very talented lady, and if she was any more attractive in a dangerous razor blade kind of way the plastic casing of your TV would melt. Very sharp little film. Turn the color off, increase the contrast a bit and hang on.",1110067200,20,1239,4.43859649122807
7988094,1,B00008Z45X,"What a disappointment! 2 actresses I have enjoyed in many performances made mistakes agreeing to make this uninspired turkey of a film. Annoying split-screen effects are intrusive and add nothing except desperate frosting to an undercooked cake. Juliette Lewis time after time looks like a deer in the headlights as the camera dwells on a vacant what-do-I-do-now look, and at least they gave her very few lines to deliver in her utterly unconvincing French Canadian. Give this one a miss. Watch ""Bound"" with Ms. Gershon if you are up for dark thriller with spicy female leads.",1487808000,,576,5.010416666666667

The only saving grace was Mickey Rourke, and he was eliminated in the first 10 minutes.  This is one of those truly awful movies where the producer owes me an hour of my life back for the time I put in- I was wiling to give it chance, but it didn't deserve one.",1306972800,,417,4.085365853658536
