6135913,5,B00H7BJ0WO,"My family was excited to see they were releasing volume 1 and 2 of Rawhide's seventh season so soon after we bought seasons 1-6, but the price was kind of a heart break. UNTIL I stumbled upon the series at my local Wal-Mart. Both Volume 1 and 2 available for $19.98 each.

TL;DR
If you're dying to complete your collection, check Wal-Mart. Otherwise I hope Amazon will get with the program soon and drop the price for y'all.",1394064000,9,424,4.435897435897436
6135914,5,B00H7BJ0WO,What's with the price? None of the other seasons were even close to the prices on seasons 7 & 8.,1393977600,3,96,3.85
6135915,5,B00H7BJ0WO,these prices are insane! I just bought season 7 vol. # 1& 2 tonight at walmarts for $19.96 each! what's going on?,1393977600,16,113,4.181818181818182

6135917,1,B00H7BJ0WO,"This is one of the great series of the Golden Age of TV -- that said I gave it ONE STAR because the price is WAY OUT OF LINE. $90.00 for the complete 7th Season is OBSCENE!! No other complete season cost anywhere near that! Complete Fifth Season is $45.51 and Complete Sixth Season is $51.35. Perhaps the person at Amazon in charge of pricing goofed. If it is not Amazons fault then the producing studio wants to gouge (""screw"" would be more apropos) fans who have consistently bought each season. The price for the complete Season Seven needs to be adjusted SHARPLY DOWNWARD!!",1390262400,21,577,4.5576923076923075

6135931,3,B00H7BJ0WO,"Season 7 seemed to have its troubles with some of the old shows from earlier seasons rearing their head here. By Season 8 Eric Fleming as Favor is gone and Clint Eastwood as Rowdy Yates is finally the trail boss but Season 7 hardly helped with this transition and halfway through Season 8, the show folded. A real pity because Eastwood was more than up for the task.",1424304000,2,366,4.397058823529412

6135942,5,B00H7BJ0WO,"Rawhide continues to hold up. The key group of actors is good and reuinited in this season. Looking ahead, you know it's going to end with the next season, but it's still in top form and there's little sign that the writers have reached the end of their imaginations at this point. Every so often there's a sort of bizarre episode, but for the most part it's great classic dusty cattle-filled, horse-filled entertainment.",1399075200,2,421,4.780821917808219
6135943,5,B00H7BJ0WO,"Rawhide season seven,volume 1, is from the executive producing team of Bernard Kowalski and Bruce Geller, who would be replaced in the latter third of the season by Andre Bohem. The Kowalski/Geller shows, which have the busts of Rowdy, Mr Favor and Wishbone at the opening, are then mixed in with the Bohem shows (which feature Sheb Wooley as Pete Nolan in the opening credits). The last episode of the season, Incident Of The Gray Rock Hotel, guest starring Lola Albright, is a holdover from the K & G team, and wears a 1964 copyright date (the Bohem episodes all say copyright 1965). Season seven is a mixture of quality versus problem shows, which then slide into the poorly produced Ben Brady era episodes of season 8.",1398211200,,722,4.692913385826771
6135944,5,B00H7BJ0WO,I like it will all these characters.  They work well together.  Sometimes when you have a good thing going you should leave it alone and this was a good thing.  Too bad they all left in the last season.  Executives think they know it all.,1397001600,2,238,4.222222222222222

6135947,5,B00H7BJ0WO,Great show great cast Walmart has these both for $19.99 each great price  you cant go wrong with Rawhide yee haw,1394755200,3,112,4.333333333333333
6135948,5,B00H7BJ0WO,"I just bought both of the Season 7 volumes at Walmart tonight for $19.96 each.  That's less than half of the price it is being sold for here on amazon.

Rawhide is a great classic western TV series and long-term fans should be able to buy it at a reasonable price.  If you live within driving distance of a Walmart, call them and ask if your local store has this in stock, and the current price. It could be worth driving a few extra miles vs the current price of $44 here on amazon.

I am really surprised amazon has not discounted this DVD release.

UPDATE - 6/22/14:  Walmart no longer has this set in stock.  Amazon still has the price way too high. If you want to buy this, you probably will be better off waiting until later in the year, or next year, as the history of the prices on the previous sets has been a substantial discount after a year or more.  As far as the content of the DVD itself, the video quality is excellent, and although some of the episodes in Season 7 are unusual for Rawhide and not up to the standards of the prior seasons, overall it's still strong material you will want in your collection.",1394236800,9,1124,4.244131455399061

8630452,2,B00H7BJ0WO,"Loved all other seasons of Rawhide but what happened here?  They do not spend much time on the trail and with the regular cast, but introduce new characters in various towns/locales who are horrible actors!  Gil Favor has changed the way he talks and is downright nasty at times...not the kind hearted trail boss of the previous seasons who always had a ""striving to do good"" message.",1497225600,,384,4.7164179104477615
