It's British all the way, but seems what I might call ""Americanized"" in that sometimes I can't get British dialogue in films, but this one was clear and understandable. For me this is a keeper which I will watch again and again because it feels good to watch it! DVD arrived in perfect condition and fast delivery.",1509667200,,477,4.558139534883721
8515285,5,B007EGW1LY,"What a great little film this is, and the transfer is BEAUTIFUL! Looks to have come from an import DVD that used 35mm elements. Looks great, sounds great and a lot of fun to watch. Don't pass it up!",1338854400,,198,4.102564102564102
