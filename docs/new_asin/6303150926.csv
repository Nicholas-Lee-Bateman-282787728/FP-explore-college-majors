591719,4,6303150926,"This is certainly not a movie for the mind or for the soul. I won't even try to list the logical problems with this one, as my quota of 1000 words would just get me warmed up :-) Suffice it to say that if you are looking for a well-knit storyline that holds itself together, about turn right now.
On the other hand, if you have an hour to fritter away and are not in a particularly picky/discriminating mood, give this one a shot. You might be surprised to find yourself grinning more often than you expected to :-)
My only kudos to Dennis Hopper is his choice of Tom Berenger. This is one heck of a good thespian, and he shines, even when cast in an otherwise silly, non-entity of a movie. Sure, Erika gets her share of attention, but mostly when she's baring it. And McNamara, well, I can't remember any other movie he was in, so I'll just say he has latent talent. A little too cute for this role, maybe.
You've probably read other reviews, so I won't bore you with a detailed storyline. Tom and McNamara are Navy guys sent to escort a prisoner from a Marine detention center. Turns out that the prisoner is a woman (Erika) and a slippery one at that. Several travails follow. Erika and McNamara fall for each other. Tom eventually helps the couple make off to Mexico or somewhere. Like I said, suspend your belief, all ye who enter here :-)
Tom plays his part to perfection, as the gruff, hardboiled, no-nonsense, sardonic military guy. I can't see anyone else better suited to this role. Watch out for a couple of hilarious scenes, when they land up at the marine detention center, and when they take a detour on their way back to base. Pretty funny 'camaraderie' too, with McNamara and a couple of sailor pinheads who want nothing more than to yank his chain.
Summary - with a couple of beers to help, what the heck, I think I actually enjoyed it!",1078876800,6,1853,4.3895348837209305
591720,3,6303150926,"I won't say that this movie was absolutely terrible, it just wasn't that good. First off since when would an E-3 seaman talk down to a E-7 chief petty officer even if it was his last day of service. Erika's scene was far too short and Berenger seemed to be likable character as the chief but he seemed to have grunted through the whole movie. This said I confess that I liked this film despite it's shortcomings but I don't think Dennis Hooper should do anymore comedies.",1049587200,3,471,4.425287356321839
591721,3,6303150926,"I'll admit, when I first saw this film, in 1994, I thought it was sophomoric, with overripe performances, a brain-dead plot, and an extremely gratuitous sex scene tossed in to show off Erika Eleniak's considerable assets.
However, seeing it again, recently, I came to realize this was actually a send-up of the 'good ol' boy' comedies of the seventies, the kind of 'B' movies Roger Corman produced, when he introduced directors like Ron Howard. As such, it's very enjoyable, and certainly worth another look!
The premise is that of an old-fashioned service comedy, with wheeler-dealer William McNamara and put-upon pal Crispen Glover pulling off one last big score before McNamara's discharge. Unfortunately, the scam goes awry as the young con artist is 'recruited' to assist grizzled vet 'Rock Reilly' (Tom Berenger, spitting out dialogue with a whiskey-soaked growl) in a prisoner transfer. The prisoner turns out to be the luscious Erika Eleniak, and as she quickly makes the first of several escape attempts, you get to see: a) exciting new uses for feminine hygiene products; b) the redneck charm of the countryside between Charleston and North Myrtle Beach, South Carolina; c) some great cameos by Dean Stockwell, Seymour Cassel, Gary Busey, Marilu Henner, Fredric Forrest, and director Dennis Hopper, himself (sporting a bulbous nose and a blow-up sex toy!); d) the famous Eleniak nude love scene, followed by McNamara chasing her, naked, after she runs, again (he shows more skin than she does); and e) the obligatory happy ending, as Berenger proves he has a 'heart of gold', and that 'love (or a healthy lust, anyway!) conquers all'.
Is this a classic? Are you kidding? Then again, neither were the Corman films...but as a tribute to the genre, 'Chasers' is fun, and a terrific 'kick off the shoes, pop some popcorn' flick!",1034121600,27,1834,5.076158940397351
591722,2,6303150926,"Why watch this movie?  It's not that good.  The plot is pretty tame.  The acting is nothing to speak of.  Again, why?  Well, if you are a fan a of nude Erika Eleniak then you watch this movie.  Really that's the good part of this flick.",973036800,23,236,4.021739130434782

591802,2,6303150926,"This alleged comedy about two shore patrolmen (Tom Berenger and William McNamara) escorting a sexy ensign (Erika Eleniak) for transport to the brig elicits a collective yawn.  The film is mundane to the extreme in both character development and plotting with the only reason to watch is the obligatory nude scene by Eleniak.  This is surprising because the film was helmed by Dennis Hopper who does offer an amusing cameo as a lingerie salesman.  I can't imagine Hopper's much maligned ""The Last Movie"" (unavailable on DVD) being this dreary and uninteresting.  The type of movie that would put the pharmaceutical company that manufactures Ambien out of business.",1431129600,,663,5.168224299065421

591827,3,6303150926,"When a shady, cocky Navy boy on his last day before discharge gets assigned to a prisoner transfer, he gets more than he ever thought he would. First when he meets his grizzled, tougher than leather partner, who apparently hates him. But both of them get upended when they pick up their prisoner and it turns out to be a beautiful young woman. And she immediately wraps them around her finger, especially the younger of the two, who is obviously infatuated with the prettiest Marine he's ever met. What follows is a comedic adventure that includes repeated escape attempts and a blossoming romance. It's got a bit of cheese, but should keep movie fans entertained. It's not the best movie ever made, mind you, but is decent entertainment. Stars William McNamara, Erika Eleniak, Tom Berenger, Crispin Glover and Gary Busey. Definitely a 'guys night' movie. A bit of swearing and nudity as well as a fight scene.",1421884800,,910,4.802547770700637

The movie itself is fairly light hearted and entertaining similar to many other action/comedy/romance type movies & shows of the 80 & 90s.

She may not be the best actress....she's not bad..but not great...but how have we not seen her in the buff more often? How could any producer see that scene and not want her in ANY ""romance"" scene?

Tom Berenger and William McNamara are pretty weak and unconvincing in their respecting roles.  The latter, especially, has to deal with playing a not very likable character as well.

In short, the music is great, the plot/setting is interesting, while the dialogues and the acting are average and sometimes below average, and then there is Erika Eleniak.  WOW!!!  As others have also pointed out, this film is indeed all about Erika Eleniak.

Tom does his usual great job of being nasty/sweet and Elena Eleniak turned out to be a surprise - in more ways than one.

As far as the movie itself, it wasn't meant to be a believable story but meant to be a showcase for some quirky pleasant personalities interacting in a movie and it does a good job at that.

I've read a few other reviews and they said the movie was filmed in South Carolina. I was in the military for a year in the area and didn't notice that it was in South Carolina, not like that movie in downtown Chicago (The Fugitive) where I lived as a small kid and still recognized it decades later.
