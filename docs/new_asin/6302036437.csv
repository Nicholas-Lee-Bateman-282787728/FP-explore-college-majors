7820873,4,6302036437,"Well, this video is interesting! There are many very young (soon to be stars) students of Bela in this video to showcase skills. A few names are: Erica Stokes, Kim Zmeskal, and Hillary Grivich. At the time of this video these gymnasts were only 8-10 yrs. old. The video was fimled during one of Bela Karolyi's summer training camps in Texas, and takes you through propper warm ups, floor exercise, beam, vault, bars, and conditioning. The video shows skills for beginners, intermediate, and advanced. At the end of every event, one of the elite gymnasts does a competitive olympic style exercise. Keep in mind this is 1988, so the hardest skill you'll see is a Full-in double somersault on floor, but still... Bela Karolyi is in the entire video instructing step, by step, which is really a bonus since he is such a genius. One complaint, though...This video shows about 25 minutes of floor exercise instruction, and only about 5-10 minutes of the other events...and, one warning: If you are freaked out by very skinny gymnasts (and i mean SKINNY), you may not like to watch this. There are a couple gymnats that could use a meal or two.",1038960000,10,1137,4.71859296482412
