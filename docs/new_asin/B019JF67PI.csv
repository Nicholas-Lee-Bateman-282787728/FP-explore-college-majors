Much to my surprise this DVD has me looking forward to the after workout AH feeling. I highly recommend this for beginners, or people (all age groups) looking for natural pain relief. - note horse  not included.",1522972800,,537,6.1466666666666665
8745383,5,B019JF67PI,"This pretty DVD is what I didn't know I needed. I'm not a ""yogi,"" I ride horseback when I'm not busy parenting or working (aka, I don't get to ride much). Kelly takes me on a journey into a beautiful, calm place, where I can stretch, and find some peace. No fuss, as in no props needed. I pop in the DVD, and receive soft, encouraging serenity. Kelly is warm and sweet, the ranch is nostalgic - I love my little time with Kelly and the horses!",1522108800,,443,4.103448275862069

8745385,5,B019JF67PI,"Yoga for the Rider far exceeded my expectations. I typically do yoga in a class setting and having never done a DVD like this, wasn't sure if it would translate to still being a challenge and create the peaceful atmosphere.  This video did both. The setting established the serene environment and Kelly's style of teaching was an ideal blend of a flow that was simple to follow.  Her focus on alignment and form really stood out to me too.  This is perfect for travelling too, so I never have to sacrifice my practice when I'm not able to get into a class.  I would highly recommend this to yogis of all levels that want a unique way of learning new techniques to kick up a basic yoga routine.  I hope she releases more videos!",1472169600,2,727,4.395522388059701
8745386,2,B019JF67PI,"I bought this thinking it would be mostly standing yoga. It is mostly on the mat stuff which kills my knees. If you are already experienced at yoga, it may work for you.  I did love the horse that snuck into the camera shot and had a look on his face that said ""what the heck is she doing"", exactly what my horse would have done, also funny when the crew cut away and he was suddenly removed from the shot.",1459296000,2,406,4.012345679012346
