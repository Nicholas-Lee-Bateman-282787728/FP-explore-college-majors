2857097,1,B000R3439Y,If you can watch it for free then give it a shot but do not pay for this.  Worst film I have ever watched concerning Chernobyl.,1346198400,3,127,3.8846153846153846
2857098,5,B000R3439Y,"This film is reminiscent of Night and Fog, a short documentary about the holocaust. Although its questions are not as directly stated as Night and Fog, the imagery, the poetry, and the sounds of this film combine to make what is the most immersive and emotionally engaging film addressing the disaster of Chernobyl. The indictments of this film are subtle but extremely powerful. What I found to be most impressive about the film is the film makers ability to capture the tranquility and the horror of Chernobyl coexisting. In a way, the film maker illustrates the invisibility of the entire event through the sincerity of his craft.",1286409600,7,633,4.925233644859813
2857099,2,B000R3439Y,"This film is not what you think.  It is not a documentary at all and does not tell a story despite its description.  It is a piece of art,  written mostly for the self-indulgence of the artist.  It is disjointed;  I learned nothing new and much of it was difficult to understand as some background poems and songs were spoken or sung in either Russian or Ukranian without translation.  It is best described as poetry with some corresponding images,  but not story telling.  I was hoping for a second ""Chernobyl Heart""  and this is a far cry.",1229990400,29,541,4.494845360824742
8198481,4,B000R3439Y,A frightening story.  Could happen anywhere in the world.  That land will be uninhabited for 1000 years.  Sad story for the workers and families.,1385683200,,145,4.958333333333333
8198482,2,B000R3439Y,We only watched ten to fifteen minutes of this before giving up and switching to another selection.  The use of a poetic metaphor did not work for us and the pace is similar to watching paint dry.,1379116800,,196,4.297297297297297
8198483,1,B000R3439Y,This is more of an art film than a documentary.  It basically  takes what most everyone has already heard and seen about the disaster and puts it to poetry and music.  I found it boring and at some points it made no sense at all.,1378944000,,229,4.044444444444444
8198484,5,B000R3439Y,"I was looking for a general documentary on the Chernobyl disaster. This was really awesome since it had spoken poetry and photography regarding the disaster, but followed the timeline of what happened providing some educational background. I really enjoyed the artistic side.

Although, if I knew nothing about the disaster, I would have been a little lost. Yet, the title says ""A film FOR Chernobyl"" which to be indicated to me that it was an honorary film, so I kind of knew what I was getting into by the title alone. Overall, I found the documentary inspiring and beautifully directed with it's point of view from people who lived through it, along with accented translations, and native languages.",1370131200,,702,4.9491525423728815
8198485,4,B000R3439Y,"This was a very sobering reality of how bad a nuclear reactor incident can go. Many people died horrible deaths from lethal radiation from this catastrophe. Sadly, many did not even know they were being exposed to it.  Although nuclear provides a clean and efficient form of energy, too few realize the price to be paid in the legacy we leave to future generations. Nuclear waste poses a deadly hazard and must be safely protected for hundreds of thousands of years. That is a big price to pay and an even bigger risk to take in our ever changing world.  It is becoming increasingly difficult to prevent this deadly waste from falling into the wrong hands.
The area around Chernobyl has become a complete ghost town slowly being reclaimed by the earth. Man will not be able to return their for millenia. It is time to focus our resources on other clean energy alternatives",1368144000,,872,4.6558441558441555
8198486,1,B000R3439Y,"I didn't make it fifteen minutes into this video before realizing that it is not a documentary about Chernobyl. It's a film project made by someone who thinks that awkward poetry read to the pace of clips and pictures is some kind of art.

Not useful for knowledge or art.",1365206400,5,272,4.44
8198487,1,B000R3439Y,It was not what I expected. Some parts were interesting but for the most part it didn't give to much info. It was only poetry and pictures of current. I wanted to hear more of what and how it happend.,1362268800,,200,4.025
8198488,4,B000R3439Y,This film was part of two students research for History Fair. They were able to get very good information and see some of the hardships that followed this catastrophe.,1360454400,,167,4.793103448275862
8198489,2,B000R3439Y,"After first watching this documentary I thought that it was a heartfelt and well-crafted film and that it deserved not just a little praise. A humble, but humane and touching work of philosphy and art.

But after watching another film about that awful day, ""Battle of Chernobyl"", I have almost completely changed my mind.

Viewing that film (that was so sagely recommended by another Amazon reviewer), one is struck by more than how awful were the events surrounding the explosion of reactor four. One is also rendered aghast with horror at just how steadfast was the official wall of lies and half-truths manufactured by domestic AND foreign governments and agencies in the wake of the release of immense amounts of radiation due to the exposure of the reactor core. And many of the those lies and misconceptions about the disaster that occurred on April 22, 1986 *still* persist to this day, (and almost without challenge.) Truths and discoveries about the real nature of the utter and Armaggedon-like failure of the reactor complex at Chernobyl continue to be ignored or are being censored outright.

The excuse that this film is not intended as a historical document but rather as a work of art just doesn't hold any water - heavy or not. In exploring an apocalyptic theme like the nuclear catastrophe at Chernobyl, any ""art"" that does not effectively expose the  horrific truths of what it addresses, that does not illuminate the biological, political and societal consequences clearly and that does not put this is some tone, some setting or some design that is communicated with true artistry has failed in part or in whole, not because it is not being confrontational but because it has forgotten that art is fundamentally about exposing truth, whether or not it is palatable or ""artistic"" to do so in the somewhat profane manner that this subject most definitely demands.

Being anthemic or haunting simply isn't enough - the victims that died heroically or not, unknowingly or not - demand more clarity and yes, more art in the telling. Not to mention  those poor souls whom will continue to die for many years to come or to suffer from ailments and deformities for decades and beyond - their sufferings and deaths demand more than what appears to be a delicate traipse through a forgotten and poisoned landscape.

Maybe even more importantly, any work of art attempting to address the philosophical or emotional surrounding such a horrendous occurrence has to resonate more than a film with the artistic hubris which Heavy Water seems to thrive upon - it does not seem to me that this art-house ""tone poem"" approach will stand the test of time, something that is imperative when future generations search back into history when they attempt to make some sense of Chernobyl.

In the end one should not be disappointed in this film because it selected an artistic approach to describing Chernobyl, but that it selected a poor artistic approach to describing Chernobyl. The events of this disaster are still being played out to this very day and will continue to do so for many millenia to come. One would think that great events would require great art to represent them and this film is not up to snuff in describing an event that history will long remember.

Two stars for some well photographed and edited scenes, but the overall impact of ""Heavy Water - A Film for Chernobyl"" sours when one realizes the huge and overarching impact of one of histories most telling human-made disasters and how Heavy Water almost utterly failed in communicating it.",1359072000,2,3561,4.892205638474295
8198490,2,B000R3439Y,"This has a very rough amount of information and is very abstract, only occasionally making any sense at all.  Could have been done much better, turn off the sound and watch probably glean a lot more.  A waste of time as it is.",1358294400,,226,4.232558139534884
