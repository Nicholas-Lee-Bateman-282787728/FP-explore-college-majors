7795731,5,0987968408,For all those ashtanga junkies out there (not many) he breaks down that elusive slow float and gives some valuable pointers on alignment to shave your shoulders etc. I have been at this for 7 years now and learned quite a bit from this video....,1498780800,,245,4.466666666666667

7795733,5,0987968408,"I'm a dedicated yoga practitioner and teacher and even though Ashtanga is not my present path, all Hatha physical movements are strongly influenced by these classic series.  No doubt David Robson and his family (from video interviews) are completely inspiring and I purchased his mp3s and DVD largely to support what they bring to the larger yoga community.  I value this DVD for David's breaking down this seemingly easy transition between all vinyasas into focal points that isolate specifics like being sure to close the shoulder joints.  As a short-torsoed, short-armed person I'm always trying to get every inch of space for floating and was probably over-extending into this mobile socket without realizing it.  I also appreciated the tip about using the head. Lastly, imprinting in one's brain by watching and visualizing how to do a physical action always helps the brain and body learn more quickly and I think just watching with focused attention how this is done well is completely worthwhile. It's not a long DVD and it's aim is very specific so make sure that's for what you are looking when purchasing. I've been to some workshops where people talk about teaching how to float and many of David's instructions were not ones I'd heard before so I did learn things that were new/different on this topic.",1382227200,8,1315,4.963636363636364
7795734,4,0987968408,"There are two for sale by this same teacher - and I couldn't tell from the information given which would be better to start with.  Learn to Float verses Learn to Float: Jump back and Jump through, the titles are too similar.  I figured this one would be simpler.  Ok, now I know - the Other one would be better to start with to build up the necessary strength to do these movements.  This is a follow up video that one.  Apparently you have to learn to float before you learn to float AND jump through. . . .

That said, I this this video has value.  He gives very specific directions, and he articulates them very well.  This is NOT a sequence video with a hour long practice, this is an INSTRUCTIONAL video with very good instructions.  These are better instructions than you are going to get a regular yoga studio even if you go for years.  Or if you live rural, like me, these are better instructions that you can find online for free - here's an actual teacher both demonstrating and explaining.

Don't buy this video until you're pretty strong.  If you're not actually able to do handstands and sun salutes yet having better explanation isn't going to magically make you able.

BUT IF YOU ARE already pretty strong this is the PERFECT video for you. Just what you've been waiting for.",1374710400,4,1290,4.438297872340425
7795735,5,0987968408,"I would highly recommend this to anyone who desire to fly and flow. The instruction is accessible to most people and it's done in a compassionate manner. Remember- Ahimsa! And this is a how to not a full length practice so don't be disappointed, it's really a gem for student and teachers.",1369785600,2,289,4.576923076923077
