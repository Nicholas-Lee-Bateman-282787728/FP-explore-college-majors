3133514,5,B0014L1PSU,"This is a short but powerful documentary on Iranian Christian Martyrs from the 1990's with emphasis on Haik Hovsepian's life.  Employing interviews, hidden-camera footage, first- hand accounts, and film-style reinactments, Haik's life is detailed as he struggles to bring Christainity to a deceptive Iran during the 1990's. Haik, in particular, a master of all trades (he even sings the background music for this film and he's very talented!), brings attention to himself and his church when he tries to free another Christian imprisoned under false pretenses.  One word of caution:  fleeting images of mutulated bodies definitely prevents whole family viewing.  But nevertheless, Haik's story must be told as his story is a template for all Christians and missionaries in Iran.  Suspenseful, emotional and moving!",1261267200,4,814,5.532258064516129
