3700534,1,B001MVWMHK,I am sure my kids would have loved this DVD had it worked... Not worth returning and losing my time... Packaging was cheap looking and DVD was not an original,1357948800,,158,4.3
3700535,5,B001MVWMHK,"I cannot tell a lie: the first time I saw this show I looked at it and said ""huh?"" The second time I got totally hooked on the thing -- and I don't even HAVE children! The humorous things they do, the inside jokes for adults, and good writing and great production values have me searching out Linny, Tuck and Ming-Ming. The DVDs I ordered arrived in great time with no problems. They are great. This calls for some celery!",1306627200,4,422,4.2875

3700537,5,B001MVWMHK,"This is a really nice collection of Wonder Pets episodes.  They're well-crafted, short and sweet adventures with wonderful songs and REAL music.  Our 2 year old son loves watching and singing along.  We don't have cable or satellite at our house so we get our Wonder Pets fix by dvd.  I especially like the number of different episodes for the price.  Our favorite one on this dvd is ""Save the Fiddler Crab on the Roof"" but they're all good.  The ""Join the Circus"" episodes is much longer than the rest. (And good for your toddler to watch while you're trying to get something accomplished - without his help :))",1259020800,8,612,4.568807339449541
3700538,5,B001MVWMHK,"As grandmother to a 2 1/2 year old who loves the Wonder Pets, I had been looking for these three plush characters for awhile.

And now I have a grandson who has to have Lenny, Tuck and Ming Ming too with him as he sings along with the videos.",1245888000,3,319,3.8923076923076922
