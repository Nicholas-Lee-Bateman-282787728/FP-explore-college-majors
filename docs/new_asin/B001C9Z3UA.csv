8286312,5,B001C9Z3UA,"Of course, this was THE Barber before the Rossini.  My father would talk about a trio in the Barber, and I, knowing only the Rossini wondered what he was talking about.  Later I discovered that there were at least four operas called ""The Barber of Seville"" of which two had been great successes.  The prelude to Paisiello's Barber is still a well-known concert piece.  I was anxious to hear the entire opera my father had been so enamored of, but  I could only find recordings of excerpts -- until this.  It's wonderful to be able to hear and see the opera whole, and in its original form.  While the Rossini may have overshadowed it -- it should still be presented today, as a really fine opera, and far more enjoyable than many of the dreary offerings we do get (Suor Angelica, Francesca da Rimini (her story is interesting; none of the operas based on it are), etc.)",1522195200,2,869,4.496815286624204
8286313,4,B001C9Z3UA,"Before Rossini created his more famous barber, there was the one created by Paisiello. This is no less memorable, and it is every bit as entertaining visually and sound-wise. Of name singers, there are none that you will have heard of but they sing and act beautifully. A first-class productuin all the way around.",1277683200,10,314,4.833333333333333
8286314,5,B001C9Z3UA,"I'm surprised no one has left reviews of this DVD.  I think it is great that we can buy DVDs of operas that are not normally played in opera houses.

Paisello's Barbiere was very popular before Rossini's, and when Rossini's opera premiered in 1816, Paisello supporters booed it and made Rossini's opening night a failure, although Rossisni's opera was a hit by the end of the week.

I think Paisello's opera is excellent and neither Paisello nor his opera deserve obscurity although I wouln't say Paisello's Barbiere is better the Rossini's masterpiece.

The music is beautiful.  I'm no expert on opera, but I enjoyed the singing.  The set is a bit minimal for my taste.",1262131200,11,670,4.782608695652174
