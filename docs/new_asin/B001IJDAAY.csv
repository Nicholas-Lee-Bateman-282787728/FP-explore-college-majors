8311001,3,B001IJDAAY,"Let's be charitable and point outthe group was quite past its prime by the time this concerto was recorded, and the addition of an opening act did nothing  improve it.  That said, once in a while the old sparks shines through.  Entertaining, but not what I expected.",1441843200,,266,4.617021276595745
8311002,5,B001IJDAAY,"I bought this to replace an identical, older DVD that didn't work anymore.  Although this new copy was shipped to the U.S. from Argentina, the delivery time wasn't unusually long, and the new DVD plays perfectly.  My South American wife thinks it's hilariously entertaining.",1389225600,,274,5.204545454545454
