2643801,3,B000HWXROC,"It is a little hooky and done by amateurs, but they are very knowledgeable about archery mechanics. I recommend this to anyone that is getting stated in archery and anyone that needs a refresher.",1170720000,2,195,4.764705882352941
2643802,4,B000HWXROC,"While the line of instruction drags at points, the producer/director is thorough regarding the variety of products shown and demonstrated. The discriptions fairly and equally spell out the pros and cons of the equipment and accessories shown and demonstrated. They do not play favorites.

The teaching portion of shooting is as good as any demonstration live or recorded I have ever seen. If you follow the demonstration provided on this DVD, you will have a lifetime sport you will really enjoy!

Watch it in small portions and you will learn a great deal about archery and archery equipment.",1169596800,6,593,5.040816326530612
2643803,5,B000HWXROC,Make sure you buy this DVD and watch it before you spend $100's of dollars on a bow and equipment.  The DVD sets out very clearly how to go about choosing not only a bow but all of the basic equipment you will need & haw to set it up.  There is a really imformative section on shooting for beginners which I found invaluable.  The naration is clear and concise as well as being easy to follow,1169251200,4,392,4.064935064935065
8141637,5,B000HWXROC,Good guide,1449446400,,10,4.5
8141638,3,B000HWXROC,"Not what I was really looking for, but still some useful Information on tuning.",1447372800,,79,4.714285714285714
8141639,4,B000HWXROC,"There is a lot of good overall info. in this dvd. Covers many topics, So they can't get real in depth but they did a pretty good job. Some might say a little boring or goofy but when I order something like this I'm not looking for entertainment but INFORMATION. And if it's a little boring or goofy that's ok if I can learn something. If I saw this before buying I probably would buy it for myself. I would say that it is going to be more beneficial to the novice to intermediate than for the advanced archer. But if you're not proud then you may find something in here that even you don't know.",1433289600,,595,4.137931034482759
8141640,2,B000HWXROC,"I'm a traditional shooter, and this video had absolutely nothing for me except a week of waiting.",1411862400,,97,4.764705882352941
8141641,3,B000HWXROC,"This DVD is an overview of technical gagets available for compound bows.. moves quickly and may be just what you need. It was, however, not a ""basics of archery skills""
that we were after. Not to say it was bad, just not the basics primer we anticipated.",1338336000,,254,4.425531914893617
8141642,2,B000HWXROC,This DVD is just a very quick overview of the mechanics and does not go into the details like I was hoping. It was a complete waste of my time and money.,1297036800,,153,3.8125
8141643,4,B000HWXROC,"This is a very good video as long as you know what you're getting.  It provides more of a review of bows and accessories than actual technical instructions (although there are some accessory installation instruction).  If you want to buy a bow and/or add accessories to your bow, this video will help.  If you're looking to repair and tune your own bow, you will need more than just this video.  The shooting instructions are helpful.",1275868800,,434,4.746666666666667
8141644,1,B000HWXROC,"Warning: This is an archery video directed towards hunting. If that is what you are looking for then you have found the right video. However, I was looking for a video that will teach me what I needed to learn about a beginner's bow, such as a recurve bow and the type of equipment I would need to take up the sport, not for hunting purposes. It seems as if the bows they showcased were too advanced for a beginner's video and in many cases it seemed as if you are already supposed to know what they are talking about. But then again it's a beginner's hunting archery guide. The only thing I did learn was how to measure myself for the right bow, so I guess that's something but it isn't worth the money I paid for it, especially considering the fact that I could have found that info online. Anyway, I was mistaken and believed that the video will at least teach me about the equipment I would need before I spent hundreds of dollars for useless items. I didn't know that this video was one of them.

Anyway, the video itself was cheesy,the audio was bad,the edits were obvious, one guy looked like he didn't even want to be there. So even if you are looking for a hunter's archery video I would probably recommend a more professional video. If you just want to take up the sport don't be fooled by the description of them showing you the equipment because I believe those are hunting bows...if they're not then I guess this proves just how much I've learned from watching the video.",1267142400,,1484,4.3768115942028984
8141645,1,B000HWXROC,"Very little information, very poorly presented. The two gentlemen in this video display good mechanical knowledge re: archery, but little knowlege of archery form, and what was presented was mostly outdated, such as the ""bent arm"" technique. The topic segments were very brief, with little detail, and the terminology used was very poorly defined and did not consider the types of questions consumers may have. Nice job on the graphics, but lttle work shown on the presentations themselves. Chalk this video up to a couple of guys trying to make a buck.",1205107200,3,553,5.021739130434782
8141646,4,B000HWXROC,a good dvd to start out with. the sound could be better but the info and exhibits are outstanding.,1186358400,3,98,4.2105263157894735
