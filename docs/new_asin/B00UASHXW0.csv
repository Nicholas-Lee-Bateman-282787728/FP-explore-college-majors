8705046,2,B00UASHXW0,"""Xtinction: Predator X"" is the original 2010 title. The film is being recirculated as ""Jurassic Predator"" as things with ""Jurassic"" in the title are being bought up. This isn't much of a story. One lone clone experiment predator kills locals. Sheriff (Lochlyn Munro) investigates. There are bad guys. Laura is the ex-wife (Elena Lyons) and Lacey Minchew sits around tied up in a bra having been ""used.""

I didn't see the end coming out of the blue. The film is SyFy made for TV quality. I don't know how they missed this gem.
