1268591,4,B00003CXJ9,"This is the type of animated movies I want to see on the big screen.  Ok, so it's not completly animated, but it sure acts like it.  The plot and  puns might be as rediculess as the show, but that's what makes it funny.  The acting was very good, animation...excellent, and that scean where  Bullwinkle is surfing through cyber-space was priceless!  And surprising  enough, this movie got 1 star, and ""Titan A.E."" (A horrid movie,  I don't recomend it!) got three stars and was terrible!  At least this  movie is making more money than ""Titan A.E."" is(By FAR!)!  Now  the only thing I want to see from this movie now is soundtrack.  Where is  it?  I need a copy.  Go see this, it's a laugh roit the whole time!",962668800,2,710,4.387596899224806
1268592,5,B00003CXJ9,"I walked into this film expecting it to be one of those movies full of corny humor and childish antics. After the movie, however, I had a much  different approach to this film. ""The Adventures of Rocky and  Bullwinkle"" is a great family film and is also an interesting treat  for adults and older kids. In ""The Adventures of Rocky and  Bullwinkle"", Moose and Squirrel's arch enemies Boris (Jason  Alexander), Natasha (Rene Russo) and Fearless Leader (Robert De Niro) come  out of reruns in a hope to take over the world. Then, the FBI sends out  Agent Karen Sympathy to bring Rocky and Bullwinkle into the real world.  This is a delightful family film that I recommend to most anyone.",962582400,6,684,4.641666666666667
1268593,5,B00003CXJ9,"I enjoyed the television cartoon series, so I was excited about seeing The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle on the big screen, and this movie lived  up to its predecessor.  First, the movie's set-up is interesting.  Instead  of going all live-action like other cartoon-to big-screen endeavors such as  George of the Jungle, ""our heroes"" are visitors from the cartoon world into  the real world.  (Each world is aware of the existence of the other.)  Everyone involved in this movie seemed to be having a great time.  The  movie is well cast; Jason Alexander and Renee Russo look just like the  cartoon Boris and Natasha and play them with zest.  It was also a treat to  hear June Foray from the television series reprise her role as the voice of  Rocky.  (Also watch for several cameo appearances.)  Before attending  the movie, I read reviews that said it was too long, but I sat through the  entire movie without checking the time once.  Yes, the plot was silly, and  the movie was filled with bad puns, but this is ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE--  that's what the show was always about.  The mistake would have been if the  movie had attempted to be more serious or ""grown-up"" than the cartoon.  (Although I expect that the movie will go over much better with adults than  with children who will not have had the experience of watching the original  show.)  This film was magical and charming, and I can't wait to see it  again.  I cannot recommend this movie highly enough.",962582400,19,1470,4.654901960784314
1268594,4,B00003CXJ9,"I am 20 years old and I love movies.  I went to see this because of the live-action meets animation feel of the movie (I loved ROGER RABBIT)
I  expected a good KID'S MOVIE, but what I found was some VERY  FUNNY--CLEAN--HUMOR that any adult would find histerical.
EXAMPLE--FBI  AGENT helping R & B steals BORIS AND NATASHA's TRUCK. ROCKY:  Hey,  that's stealing, why'd you do that BULLWINKLE: Yeah, at least you could've  got something with BUCKET SEATS ROCKY: BUllwinkle!
Its funny when  Bullwinkle says it, trust me.  VERY ENTERTAINING AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO  BRING THE KIDS, if you don't want to.",962409600,,597,4.70873786407767
1268595,2,B00003CXJ9,"Being a great fan of the Rocky & Bullwinkle television series, I looked forward to THE ADVENTURES OF ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE with great  anticipation.  The original series was geared toward adults, savvy and  funny, while suitable for children's viewing.  The movie, unfortunately,  fell so flat as to be ONLY suitable for children's viewing, maintaining  none of the cleverness of the original shows.
PLOT:  Boris and Natasha  (Jason Alexander and Rene Russo) are pulled out of the toon world and into  the real world along with Fearless Leader (Robert DeNiro), and decide to  zombify the whole world through use of a clever television statio front  RBTV (""Really Bad Television"").  Special FBI agent Karen Sympathy  (Piper Perabo) is put on the job to stop them, and enlists Rocky and  Bullwinkle (computer animated toons).  The plot really ends there, and this  movie plods along in tedium, interrupted occasionally by the pleasant  cameos of John Goodman, Jonathan Winters, Janeane Garafalo, Billy Crystal,  Whoopi Goldberg and others.
The scriptwriters either completely missed  what the original show was all about, were not capable of being that  clever, or simply wanted to make a movie geared toward the ELMO IN  GROUCHLAND set.  This movie had some major flaws, the most apparent being  the prominence of Karen Sympathy, the pubescent special agent.  Instead of  letting us really get to know Boris and Natasha, who seemed worth focusing  on, we were forced to follow the boring exploits of Karen the wonder-agent,  who looks like she's fresh from Junior High School.  Rocky and Bullwinkle  even took back seats to appearances by Nickelodeon's Kenan and  Kel.
Throughout, the movie looks great -- the costumes, the special  effects, the actors.  However, it just doesn't have any substance.  I can  only recommend this movie to those who liked the DUDLEY DO-RIGHT movie,  die-hard Rocky and Bullwinkle fans (although they'll be embarrassed and  annoyed by this movie), and parents desperate to take their small children  out to a movie suitable for family viewing.  Actually, I would recommend  watching the old cartoons, and skipping this miserable flick.",962409600,3,2163,5.213450292397661
1268596,4,B00003CXJ9,"Ahhh yes. Rocky & Bulwinkle. Two wonderful cartoon characters from my  youth. I took my family to this movie the first day of release. As usual, I  wasn't expecting a whole lot from it, mostly because I figured it wouldn't  stand up well to the original series. Of couse it doesn't compare to the  series, and never could. However, I did end up enjoying the movie. The  reason is because they made a strong effort to stay with the style of the  series. Using a narrator who tended to stray all over the plot, using  immaginatative wordplay between Rocky and Bulwinkle, and of course the  wonderful characterizations of Boris and Natasha (played by Jason Alexander  and Rene Russo) kept me interested in what was happening on the screen.  This made up for a plot that was just a tad too silly, even for R & B  standards. The most fun I had was listening to both my 7 & 9 year olds  giggling throughout the movie.
There are a few weak points though. One is  there is precious little of Jay Ward's wonderful humor that was directed at  the adult. This IS primarily a kids movie. Also, one thing I was extremely  disappointed in was the inclusion of two ""questionable"" words  that had absolutely no reason to be there except to display the actors  command of inappropriate language. The words aren't horrible, but they were  also not necessary either. What a shame!
All-in-all I wouldn't hesitate  to recommend this movie to families looking for some semi-mindless  entertainment. Just remember, if you're a BIG ""Moose &  Squirrel"" fan like I am, please don't expect miracles. Nothing will  compare to the original. As long as you remember that, then you should  enjoy the movie.",962323200,5,1675,4.660958904109589

1268657,4,B00003CXJ9,"This is one of those films that is pretty self-aware that it's not that good, and is intentionally bad at times. It's a style that works sometimes (see Black Dynamite) and fails other times (see Samurai Cop 2). This is a time where I think it actually kinda works. From Bullwinkle's very stupid puns to the constant fourth wall breaks. From John Goodman's cameo that references that it's John Goodman to Jonathan Winters making a cameo THREE times to play THREE different characters. This movie just knows it's not THAT great, and that in return helps it with being entertaining. Robert DeNiro is great as Fearless Leader and the rest of the cast (although mostly cameos, really) are pretty alright as well. This is truly a nice family film that I suggest watching if you were a ""90's kid"" (it's oddly nostalgic for me, even though I've only seen it recently).
I don't understand a lot of the hate this movie gets in reviews. It's fun, and I can excuse the film's stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid puns, because the story makes sense and the film realizes it's not gonna be some masterpiece and just tries to have fun, and sometimes in a film, that's good enough for me.",1505174400,3,1175,4.626794258373206

1268664,3,B00003CXJ9,"Released in 2000 and directed by Des McAnuff, The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle is a live action cartoon based on the early 60s animated show. Rocky and Bullwinkle are CGI (voiced by June Foray and Keith Scott) while Boris, Natasha and Fearless Leader are played by actors (Jason Alexander, Rene Russo and Robert De Niro respectively). Piper Perabo stars as a klutzy, sympathetic FBI agent whos assigned to bring Rocky and Bullwinkle into the real world and bring them across the country in order to stop the diabolic scheme of Fearless leader to hypnotize the American populace through RBTV (Really Bad TV), compelling them to elect him as president. Numerous actors are featured in peripheral roles or cameos, like Randy Quaid, James Rebhorn, Whoopi Goldberg, John Goodman, Jonathan Winters, Kenan Thompson and Kel Mitchell, amongst others.

To enjoy a movie like this you have to be willing to enter into its goofy world and roll with it. If you can do that, it has its amusing moments and is noticeably better than Dudley Do-Right (1999), but its nowhere close the quality of the The Flintstones (1994) or its almost-as-good sequel, The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas, which was released two months before Rocky and Bullwinkle. The original Rocky and Bullwinkle TV show was never as popular as The Flintstones show and this mightve contributed to the movie flopping at the box office, but its main problem is that its overall mediocre despite its undeniable fun energy.

This was Perabos second feature film and her first in a major role. Shes the main protagonist and pretty much carries the movie, which is surprising in light of her lack of experience up to this point. Later the same year she starred in the semi-iconic, but shallow, ""Coyote Ugly.""

The satirization of the lamestream media's power to dupe people into supporting a dubious candidate (or vilify another) is well done and reflects reality. How else could someone like HeyLIARy Rotten Clinton get so many votes?

The film runs 92 minutes and was shot mostly in California, but also Washington DC and New York.

And despite falling into all three of these, this movie not only avoids disaster it captures the spirit of the original show but also blends it into the current setting.

A full-fledged cartoon version would have been far better. The human actors don't fit in with their cartoon counterparts. Robert DeNiro certainly didn't fit the part of Fearless Leader (they should have given that role to Nicholas Cage, who had a more suitable physique). We could have done without ""Nothing But A Dreamer"" by Supertramp either (the cartoon didn't have music, other than the theme and some ""dramatic effect"" chords at times) This effectively spoiled the old cartoon atmosphere, and the story itself was meandering and ultimately boring and pointless. For the running time, they could have done so much more.

1268825,5,B00003CXJ9,"given the success (critically as well as commercially) of the recent Peabody & Sherman film, it's difficult for us fans NOT to reflect on the series from whence it came, to say nothing of the three previous films to spring from the same source. sadly, rumor and juggernaut have kept them from achieving the same accolades, and the uninitiated are bound to get the impression that these worthy companion pieces are, well, unworthy.
the one that's taken the most severe beating is easily the turn-of-the-century showcase for the series' flagship characters. most obviously, there's the less than stellar track record of cinematic revivals of tv series. movies translating cartoons to live action aren't overly renown, either. for another thing, comedy in general gets only token respect. oh yes, and most infamously, Robert DeNiro dared to play as far against type as he could possibly get (in terms of both character and vehicle.) so there was plenty of ammunition for the sourpusses of this world to make the film sound like some sort of medieval torture device.
(well, as per a common them in my reviews, it wouldn't be the first movie ""common knowledge"" basically slandered.)
in point of fact, it's hard to imagine any other way to approach the project. this film fully understands and sincerely appreciates the spirit of it's source material. (which, incidentally, is still the single greatest cartoon series in television history.) the plot is as close to genius as this sort of thing gets: our ""stalwart moose"" and ""plucky squirrel"" heroes bemoan their apparent redundancy in a world that appears to of forgotten them since cancellation decades ago...until summoned to Real Life by a perky but dedicated FBI agent. it seems that Fearless Leader and company have broken free of the Animation Universe, counting on that very attention-span deficit to help them hypnotize the world and get ""F.L."" elected president.
it's true that DeNiro seems a bit too ""star"" to take on a pastiche character Fearless Leader, but he ""gets"" the character and has fun with the part. Jason Alexander and Rene Russo adapt themselves to Boris & Natasha with similar aplomb. nor is any harm done by the myriad of nifty cameos (Jonathan Winters, Billy Crystal, Janine Garofalo, Carl Reiner, etc.). my favorites are Whoopi Goldberg as a valley-girl judge (""celebrities are about the law!!"") and John Goodman as a gung-ho highway patrolman. (""she's really with the FBI."" ""yeah right, an' i'm really John Goodman."")
as for our heroes, they remain cartoons in the transference to our world. the integration work is seamless, and that's how they should be anyway. but doesn't this raise a few questions or leaves a few holes in the plot? the film settles this conundrum in classic Bullwinkle fashion: pressed upon the point, our FBI heroine says, ""i didn't write this movie, i'm only one of the characters!!"" in other words, the classic self-aware perception is alive and well.
if it ever misses the feel of the original, it's only because there's no intermissions filled by Dudley Do-Right or Peabody & Sherman. (and since both got their own movies, it's not exactly a slight.) that's the closest thing to a nit to be picked here. it's only fitting that the greatest cartoon inspired movie of all time should be based upon the greatest cartoon series of all time.
looking back, it seems the film's unsavory reputation was fueled predominantly by Howard Stern. somehow, Stern managed to coerce guest Jason Alexander into apologizing for the film. not only that, but the notoriously obdurate Stern would milk the sound-byte for months to come.
as usual, Stern is full of it. this is a truly delightful film and nothing for Jason Alexander (or anyone else involved) to be ashamed of.

I've never seen the Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons, but this film immediately has me interested in seeing what they're all about.  As for the film itself, it was decent.  It engaged in just about every Hollywood joke imaginable, from celebrities being ""above the law"", as a judge put it, to the many, sometimes random cameos throughout the picture.  I do now understand that joke about ""Robert Deniro's agent"" that was made at the 2014 White House Correspondents Dinner...the man seems to take so many different roles.  Here, where he plays Rocky and Bullwinkle's Russian arch-nemesis Fearless Leader in 3-D form, he does all right and certainly looks the part, but I just can't remember him doing anything really funny.  Again, Piper Perabo was my favorite.  If my timing's right, the Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons were coming out around the same time as many whimsical cartoons like the one about the talking race car (circa 1960ish), so I'd say the humor was spot-on.  Maybe because other cartoons of the time like The Flintstones are always being re-run and are therefore better known, this film just didn't do as well as, like me, others had probably not seen the original cartoons.  Oh well, I'm interested now, so let's see what they're all about.  For now, this was a decent film that only went overboard in corniness every so often.  Enjoy.",1403049600,,1519,4.777777777777778

1268834,5,B00003CXJ9,"I've never heard anything positive about this film, and - by default - I thought that probably meant it was just as awful/cheezy as cartoon-to-live film adaptations nearly always are.

Happily, I was totally mistaken - it is much, much cheesier!!

The film has a great structure, a great screenplay, decent casting, fantastic self-referential- and in-jokes, and is just fun from end-to-end. And cameos!! Rocky and Bullwinkle also look and sound pretty good - the voice of Rocky (but not Natascha, obviously, since Rene Russo plays that character) is by June Foray, who did the original voice of Rocky; but new voices were found for Bullwinkle and the Narrator, whose original voice actors had passed away in 1994 and 1985 respectively. The new voice of Bullwinkle is okay, perhaps a bit higher in pitch than the original; this is unfortunate, given how important that goofy voice is to any Rocky & Bullwinkle story (and how easy it is to imitate Bullwinkle), but that's the only negative point in an otherwise excellent adaptation. The narrator, for example, is tops, and we even get a little bonus feature when we get to see how he's spent the last 35 years!

The opening ironic animated sequence is probably funnier than any of the original animated shows (which I love, so I don't say something like this lightly), summing up 35 years of retirement for our two chums. The screwball plot involves evil dictators who become studio moguls so that they can turn the people of the world into zombies by subjecting them to really bad television (RBTV) through inane shows like ""Three spies and a horse who is also a spy"" (everyone, including the horse, wear shades - there's a Dudley Do-Right reference here as well, given that they're riding the horse backwards). Funny visual pun about a mole in the white house, another about the ""green light"" for the film project (hilarious). Minnie Mogul in a Hollywood studio shredding scripts that are ""too intelligent"". Robert De Niro plays Fearless Leader, and there's a great scene of him boogying with Boris and Natascha to ""Secret Agent Man"" (Mark Mothersbaugh of Devo did the soundtrack, and this is one of the songs the band covered). He also (awkwardly) parodies his own ""are you talking to me?"" speech from Taxi Driver. Later in the film our evil trio sings a great Pottsylvanian national anthem with some pretty funny lyrics (""land of the black and the blue""). Great Roger Rabbit reference, and a funny ""you like me, you really like me"" reference to Sally Field. Love Bullwinkle's inane speech at Watsamatta U, his alma mater in DeBitter Ind. Radio Shed. Thirty cop cars peal out after Agent Sympathy. ""Yeah, right - and I'm John Goodman."" He is! Don Novello playing twins that say ""Mama mia, it's Rocky & Bullwinkle!"" ""Celebrities are above the law!"" ""Gosh, another weird coincidence."" The Statue of Liberty in a scene as Supertramp's ""Dreamer"" plays... and you really don't hear a lot of Supertramp these days The good guys get turned into vegetables, literally, and one of them even becomes a flaming carrot! Bullwinkle surfs the ""information super-highway"" (who uses that term any more?!?!) for some unintentional humor at last, and we look on lovingly as the TV station's name changes from Really Bad TV to Rocky & Bullwinkle TV.

Piper Perabo plays Karen Sympathy, a goofy FBI agent, who's the only real new character in the show other than a few anonymous cameos (Randy Quaid as her boss, for example, John Goodman as a cop, Jonathan Winter in several roles, Whoopi Goldberg as a star-struck judge, and others. Jon Shapiro has a cameo in the film as well, making that two The Big Leboswki alumni to appear n the film (alongside Goodman). Wow!

The DVD comes with a featurette that mostly sets up the plot, and brags about how it will appeal to all demographics (even teenage boys, who'll like Piper Perabo). The film came out in 2000, but they'd been trying to make it since 1992, through series creator Jay Ward's daughter (?) Tiffany Ward. Rene Russo and Jason Alexander talk (ironic, since Alexander disowned the film); Alexander claims he was born to play Boris and praised the silliness of the film, Russo praised Alexander, they replay the brilliant ""little Boris and Natascha"" scene when  Natascha shows her motherly instincts ""saved by the bell."" At the end, Bill Scott demonstrates how he voiced Bullwinkle. Not bad.",1388534400,,4380,4.8646112600536195

I think that the animation is borderline horrendous by fake it looks. But I think that adds to the charm of it, since they are playing cartoon characters in the real world.

1268883,5,B00003CXJ9,"I expected this to be like any other big screen reboot of a classic cartoon comedy--long on high tech as a way to make live action live up to what frame-by-frame animation had accomplished way back when. And the humor itself revealing a generation of gag-writing talent trying to do the job with a completely different definition of what's funny than the original talent.

Let's face it--TV and movie comedy in the old days had some wit to it. There were certain talents who built their comedy entirely on insults--Milton Berle and Don Rickles for example--but the majority of comedy was either built on wit, plays on words or wackiness derived from classic slapstick. Today you turn on the tube and you get entire half-hours of putdowns reminiscent of urban street games like ""the Dozens"". Our closest descendant of slapstick is ""reality TV"", where people make fools of themselves on network TV and don't have to admit that's all they're doing. Not really funny, just dumb.

In this film, we have Boris and Natasha acting on behalf of Fearless Leader (Robert DeNiro) of Pottsylvania (originally an anology of the Soviet Union) to use American TV to brainwash the American people. The FBI (who all dress Brooks Brothers style, including female agents) assigns kid-sister cute agent Karen Sympathy to dig Rocky and Bullwinkle out of retirement to join her on a desperate cross-country run to the iconic 30 Rock to save America. The trip takes on the aspect of ""Gumball Rally"" in some places, with Rocky and Bullwinkle driving an old Chrysler Sebring ragtop given to Bullwinkle by admiring younger fellow alumni from his alma mater Wossamatta U, Karen driving the official ""chick car""--a VW New Beetle convertible, and Boris and Natasha in a chopper they steal. If I'd had my druthers and had been involved in casting, I would have preferred Danny DeVito as Boris and Cher as Natasha (she has the height, the voice and would only need to learn the accent). Maybe this qualifies as a ""spoiler"", but at one point Fearless Leader speaks of Pottsylvanian ""hospitability"" (if that's really a word) and Natasha defines it; ""Ees ability to put you een hospital"". That one has me guessing there must have been an older person among the writers or in a position to toss in suggestions.",1319673600,2,2274,4.858247422680412

The puns are there such as Crimia River,  a joke sure to be lost on today's 10-year-old. The puns aren't enough for this baby boomer to find any redeeming value in the script. The cultural references are there such as DeNiro repeating ""you talkin' to me"" -- that scene actually was painful for me to watch.  Some scenes were such a stretch that they fell horribly flat, for example, Rocky asking what today's students protest--I wanted someone to answer ""this feeble movie.""

1268910,4,B00003CXJ9,"The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle (2000) Hokey smokes! Moose and Squirrel are on video! Jay Ward's beloved cartoon characters become the latest television characters to make the Big Screen transition, having languished in reruns since their prime time series was cancelled in the mid 1960's.
  Through a contrived plot device (we know it's contrived because the familiar voice of the narrator tells us it is) those dastardly villains Boris, Natasha, and Fearless Leader have become live action humans and are plotting to take over America. But thankfully a wise FBI agent (Randy Quaid) sends one of his agents (Piper Perabo) to retrieve Rocket J. Squirrel and Bullwinkle J. Moose from their quiet life in reruns in Frostbite Falls, and the animated stars are soon interacting with the real world like the Toons in Roger Rabbit.
  This is a loving tribute to the television show, with an absolutely silly sense of humor throwing jokes of every kind in every direction. Everything works wonderfully, from the voices of original Rocky June Foray and new Bullwinkle Keith Scott to the visual effects to the performances of the human stars and the celebrity cameos that pop up every few minutes. Special mention must be made of the bad guys. Jason Alexander and Rene Russo are simply terrific as Boris and Natasha, and Robert DeNiro seems to be having the time of his life as Fearless Leader. Also, kudos to Piper Perabo, at the time a screen newcomer who's just too cute for words as FBI Agent Karen Sympathy.

1268912,5,B00003CXJ9,"THE ADVENTURES OF ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE is based on the Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoon series, shown on television at a time when America's ""baby-boomers"" were still kids.

The voices of Rocky and Bullwinkle are indistinguishable from those of the original cartoon characters. In fact, June Foray (the original Rocky) is the voice of the present Rocky. The images are different, of course, since THE ADVENTURES OF ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE shows the two characters as quasi-three dimensional drawings. The voice of the narrator seems exactly as in the original cartoons.

The movie has the following plot. In brief, Robert De Niro takes over a number of television networks, with the goal of putting on hypnotically dull programming, with the eventual goal of hypnotizing the American public into letting him the entire country. The FBI hires a young investigator, Piper Perabo (FBI agent Karen Sympathy), to get Robert De Niro under control. She goes to Hollywood, and uses a special green ray to rouse Rocky and Bullwinkle from retirement, travel from Hollywood to New York City, and bring Robert De Niro under control.

Piper Perabo provides many amusing facial expressions. If you like all the amusing winks, flirts, grimaces, eyeball rollings, and other expressions found in kids' movies, such as the classic FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF then you will love Piper Perabo in THE ADVENTURES OF ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE.

Most of the movie takes the form of a road comedy, for example, in the manner of the road movie, IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD. Please note that Jonathan Winters appears in both THE ADVENTURES OF ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE and in IT'S A MAD, MAD, MAD, MAD WORLD.

The film begins with a cartoon drawn in the old style of the original series. The narrator begins, ""In a little house at the top of the stump forest . . ."" referring to the fact that the forest at Frostbite Falls, MN, has been cut down. Bullwinkle says, ""I'm going for a walk in the forest."" But Rocky corrects him, ""But Bullwinkle, there aren't any woods any more."" To this, Bullwinkle replies, ""You don't have to tell me. I'm chairman of the Frostbite Falls Society for Conversation."" ""You mean conservation,"" says Rocky, providing a correction. ""Well, somebody's got to start talking about it,"" exclaims Bullwinkle, continuing the pun.

In the next scene, we see Minnie Mogul, a young executive in the movie industry, reviewing scripts. Behind her are stacks of at least 1000 scripts. ""Too intelligent,"" she quips. ""Too intelligent,"" she efficiently comments. Eventually, she decides to recommend a film about Rocky and Bullwinkle. She goes to the head of the studio, but he proclaims, ""I DON'T LIKE MOOSE MOVIES.""

The issue of Fearless Leader arises when the President of the United States is being briefed in the Oval Office. ""For the last six months, a cartoon TV villain named Fearless Leader has been buying up every single cable TV network in the country.""

In Fearless Leader's headquarters, we see him testing one of his boring movies on 30 or so subjects. A technician turns the dial on an amazing Star Wars-type machine. The machine jiggles and jumps. A needle on the machine moves from BORED, to APATHETIC, to HYPNOTIZED, and finally to ZOMBIFIED. We see the subjects becoming more and more glassy-eyed and complacent, with goofy smiles.

Fearless Leader receives training for using a machine intended to get rid of Rocky and Bullwinkle. A ten year old girl provides the training: ""The computer degenerating imagery or CDI is totally user friendly. Just enter the binary code and the CDI will dismantle the film stock. Okay?"" The ten year old rattles off the instructions very quickly and with charming arrogance. ""Here's the manual. She's all yours. I assume you're both computer literate,"" she snaps at Boris and Natasha, with arrogant charm. The manual is a huge book, weighing at least 20 pounds. The machine is shown being tested on a cartoon weasel. The CDI dissipates the weasel.

Piper Perabo arrives in Hollywood and, using spy techniques, gains access to the Green Light, located in a lighthouse on the movie lot. Piper Perabo activates the controls of a huge science fiction gadget. She types: ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE. She selects a button reading: ROAD COMEDY. Moments later, Rocky and Bullwinkle spill out of the light, and land on the floor of the lighthouse. ""I think we're on the wrong show,"" exclaims Bullwinkle, taking note of Piper Perabo a few feet away from him. (This is the first time that Rocky and Bullwinkle see a real person.) ""Look how good they drew that girl,"" exclaims Bullwinkle.

To provide more fun examples: Rocky and Bullwinkle are on their way from Hollywood to New York, traveling in a truck they stole from Boris and Natasha. They get arrested and are put on trial. Bullwinkle, never known for being clever, accidently testifies against himself in court. In other words, he believes that he is in control of the situation, as he stands in the courtroom, but he is actually incriminating himself. Later on in the courtroom scene, the judge (Whoopy Goldberg) displays disinterest and impatience with the trial. But when she puts on her glasses, things come into focus, and she realizes who the defendants are. ""Omigawd! Omigawwwd! It's Rocky and Bullwinkle,"" she gushes in admiration. Regaining composure, Whoopy Goldberg becomes stern, bangs her gavel, and proclaims, ""CELEBRITIES ARE ABOVE THE LAW. CASE DISMISSED!""

You'd think an update of an animated series as subversive and clever as the orginal Rocky and Bullwinkle would invariably fail miserably, but I think all of the charm of the original and its wit is recreated here.

R&B were truly a product of their era, references to the cold war were everywhere, but the movie is able to use the same style of humor very well while updating it to today.

There are lots of unexpected movie star cameos, if you're into that sort of thing, but it was a joy to me just to hear June Foray, a wondefully tallented voice actress, just giving voice to Rocky one last time. Unfortunately, Bill Scott, the original Bullwinkle, has passed on but his son plays him here and the difference is close to unnoticable.

It's not a laugh riot.  But then again, neither was the original cartoon.  What it has going for it is a lot of corny humor, a ridiculous plot, and, of course, Robert Deniro's dead on impersonation of Fearless Leader.  Really, it's kind of scary how well he does it.  And the entire movie could've been terrible and it still would've been worth it to watch DeNiro spoof his ""Taxi Driver"" role.

The movie's humor comes from its dialogue, its strange characters, its patently absurd plot twists, and of course, the trademark breaking of the fourth wall.  There's even some intelligence behind this silliness, though most won't get past the puns to notice it.

In fact the creators of this movie had the good sense to not update our dynamic duo or in any way make them politically correct, except perhaps Bullwinkle's repeated concern over Frostbite Falls denuded forests.

If you found the cartoons funny this show will strike you the same way, with the narrator providing some of the best lines.  True, the last third of the show drags a little as the cartoon-turned-flesh trio of Fearless Leader, Boris and Natasha get their comeuppance from squirrel and moose.  Such is the nature of comedy, however: comedic movies that are equally funny from beginning to end are rare birds indeed.

The humans in the movie do pretty well.  I wouldn't have thought of Rene Russo as Natasha but she pulls it off.  So do Jason Alexander (Boris) and Robert De Niro (Fearless Leader)in their roles.  Piper Perabo (Karen Sympathy) is adequate but in her defense she also has the hardest acting job to fulfill.

1268971,3,B00003CXJ9,"On November 19, 1959, the lowly (and still fairly new at the time) ABC network began airing an afternoon black-and-white cartoon show called ""Rocky and His Friends,"" starring Rocky J. Squirrel, Bullwinkle J. Moose, and a host of other funny characters. Little did ABC know that they had the beginning of what would become America's decades long love affair with moose and squirrel.

In 1961, moose and squirrel changed networks (to NBC), changed time slots (to primetime), changed colors (full colorization), and changed titles (to ""The Bullwinkle Show""). Starting on September 24, 1961, ""The Bullwinkle Show"" ran for 20 straight weeks in primetime without missing a week or a repeat. In 1962 (and continuing until 1964), NBC moved moose and squirrel to their Saturday morning lineup, where the last new episode would air on June 28, 1963.

In 1964, ""The Bullwinkle Show"" returned to ABC, where reruns would air until 1973. Since then, moose and squirrel have aired on and off in syndication and on cable networks under various titles, including ""The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show.""

Fast forward to the Summer of 2000. Moose and squirrel are finally released from reruns so that they can star in a live-action / computer generated movie.

According to many reviewers, moose and squirrel probably should have stayed in reruns.

""The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle"" is filled with bad puns, sorry jokes, and a plot line that smells fishy. In other words, it's a really cheesy movie.

Whether or not you like this cheesy movie will probably depend on how big of a fan you are of the original, classic cartoon series.

The movie's thin plot goes something like this: Fearless Leader, Boris Badenov, and Natasha Fatale have left Pottsylvania. By attaching themselves to the movie version of the ""Rocky & Bullwinkle Show,"" (don't ask), the three misfit villains are now live action villains running loose in America.

Their plan? To hypnotize all of America by making them watch really bad television (no, not the FOX channel.... though there probably isn't much difference).

After losing three undercover FBI agents to Fearless Leader, Agent Karen Sympathy (sound the name out: care 'n sympathy... the names only get worse from here folks) is ordered to find a way to get Rocky and Bullwinkle out of reruns so that they can stop the bad guys. Naturally, Boris and Natasha immediately try to stop moose & squirrel, and just as naturally they never even get close. But watching them try is fun.

Jason Alexander (Boris) and Renee Russo (Natasha) do a pretty good job of turning their cartoon counterparts into live action idiots. Not perfect, mind you. But not bad either. For the most part, they are able to convey the cartoonish nature of the characters without ever making you feel like they are trying to do so.

Robert DeNiro, however, did not do as good of a job with his part of Fearless Leader. I found DeNiro's portrayal to be extremely grating on my nerves. Part of the problem is not Mr. DeNiro's fault: the part was written very poorly. But the majority of the blame has to fall on Mr. DeNiro, who portrayed Fearless Leader very two-dimensional (even more two-dimensional the character was drawn back in the cartoon series).

Except for the very beginning and end of the movie, Rocky and Bullwinkle themselves are computer-generated cartoons. This gives them a three-dimensional look while keeping them cartoonish (though I doubt they need any help in that area).

The interaction between the live actors and computer-generated moose and squirrel were, unfortunately, fairly lacking, with most of the blame falling on Piper Perabo (the aforementioned Karen Sympathy). However, it should be noted that this was Piper's first starring movie role, with only two 16-minute shorts and a bit part in another movie to her credit previously. She would redeem herself with critics later the same year in ""Coyote Ugly.""

If you are a fan of the original cartoon series, this movie is probably not for you. The jokes, puns, and overall plot just do not stand up to the original series in any shape, form, or fashion.

If you have never really paid attention to the original series, or if you are able to ignore how good the original series was, then this movie is not too bad. There is plenty to smile at (there are several cameos, including an always good-for-a-laugh Jonathan Winters). And, believe it or not, there are even a few genuine laughs to be had.

Overall, this movie isn't a bad way to spend a couple of hours one day. Just rent it instead of buying it.",1101081600,,4562,4.882276843467012

However, the plot involves making people watch bad television. I wonder if they should add bad movies too. There is really no need to bother with this film if you're a fan of the original cartoons. As Spanky Mc Farland (of Little Rascals/Our Gang fame) said upon the release of the 1990s Little rascals remake, ""Why bother? We got it right the first time!""",1099526400,5,574,4.637254901960785

I cannot fault the performers, who were definitely in character and tried to rise above the material.  The one exception is Piper Perabo, who is completely unable to act whatsoever.  She can't act, she's not attractive, and she has no comedic timing, so what she's doing in the film is unclear at best.

The script is chock full of exposition.  Loads of exposition.  I wonder if the studio was so concerned that no one would know who Rocky and Bullwinkle were that they tacked on the beginning newsreel-esque footing to explain.  That footage is terrible.  And it's on top of the deadening, endless exposition that follows.  Come on, it's moose and squirrel!  If the viewers don't know who they are at first, they can figure it out in context.

The film continues ever so slowly, with no discernible plot (not always a bad thing in comedies) and with very few genuinely funny moments.  The direction hurts, and is suited much more to drama than to comedy.  In the special features section of the DVD, it is brought up more than once that it took years to get this project moving, and that the script had been in development for most of that time.  It's hard to believe that with 8+ years to work they couldn't do any better than this.

Most of my ""laugh out loud episodes"" came when Rocky and Bullwinkle were onscreen and the usual Jay Ward type wordplay was in progress.  I myself (in contrast to other reviews) found those segments to be up to speed with the quality of the original.  Even a lot of the live action stuff was amusing in its own way.  Fans of the show shouldn't be disappointed, I don't think--I wasn't.  The major reason this film is considered a ""failure"" is I think because it failed to live up to mass market expectations despite the presence of some big names.  The one thing I would have changed, which would have made it more of a product specifically for Bullwinkle fans (but a better film) was to let Boris, Natasha and Fearless Leader remain animated also.  Jason Alexander and Rene Russo fare better at looking and sounding like B and N than Dave Thomas and Sally Kellerman in the B & N movie but I never quite stop feeling that it's them doing impressions, not that they are the characters.  If you are a Bullwinkle fan already, odds are are you'll like it a lot anyway.

1269026,4,B00003CXJ9,"This movie has many wonderful pieces in it. First are Rocky and Bullwinkle themselves, resurrected after (now) forty years. No matter what the quality of animation, they're still among my favorite cartoons. Second is Robert DeNiro. Yes, the same DeNiro as in ""Frankenstein"", ""Analyze This"", ""Taxi Driver"" and lots more. After that, and in no particular order, are Karen Sympathy (Piper Pirabo), Rene Russo (Natasha), and the technical magicians who pulled R&B into the real world, a la Roger Rabbit.

Those great pieces sway my judgement. I really like this movie. By all rights, I shouldn't. The main mood is ""campy"" - not a bad thing, necessarily. It's just that, whatever this movie does, it never does quite enough. The animation/reality mix is fun, but has been done better. Fearless Leader, Boris, and Natasha are surprisingly well done, but actors enacting comic figures have also been done better (except maybe Fearless Leader). Goofy, cartoony props have been done for at least seventy years. They've very often been done better, sometimes without meaning to.

I like this anyway. Beat your expectations into unconsciousness, then go ahead and enjoy it. No adult themes, no serious aggression - it may be good for kids, but lots of six year olds will find it unsophisticated. I guess we grownups will be stuck watching it by ourselves. I consider that the kids' problem, not mine.

While I don't like where that trend ended up (today's cynicism is mindless, and taught in highschool), I have to give the show credit for it's gutsy innovativeness.
  As for the movie, it works as a remembrance of the 60's show and of the cold war that inspired it.
  All it lacks is some of the cynicism (counterbalanced brilliantly by Rocky's naive faith), of the original. But that's ok, times have changed, and this is a mostly faithful representation of an important time in American cultural history.

I hardly remember anything from this movie anymore and this is coming from someone who can remember almost every line of several all-time favorites like Robin Hood(Disney version) &  Great Mouse Detective. That's generally how misconcieved the plot of this movie is. Forgettable. All this movie is is just a hodgepodge mess.
There isn't much of anything that this movie offers. Little humor, just plain boredom is what results in wasting 90 minutes watching this movie.

I am glad to say that the movie doesn't.

Granted the movie doesn't have as many witty one-liners and jokes aimed at adults as the series did. Granted that the evil trio slows the film down a bit when they become real-life characters. Granted the plot of the script was kind of lame. But, riddle me this, riddle me that, when was there ever a ""great"" plot on the original series? There wasn't. The show was a poorly animated series made for kids, but aimed at adults. Whereas, the movie is a somewhat poorly animated film made for adults, but aimed at kids. There is a whole generation of people who never heard of Rocky and Bullwinkle and the film does a great job of introducing them to the adventurous duo.

As for the complaints about the poor animation, what did you expect, a SHREK-type animated film? THE ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE show was one of the worst drawn cartoon series of all time. Yet, the show was a success. It was a success because it wasn't about the animation, it was about the witty dialogue and outlandish situations.

When I first heard ""Rocky & Bullwinkle"" were getting the big screen treatment,I was very excited,I was a big fan of the original as a child. I figured at the very least a brilliant ""Roger Rabbit"" type of film,mixing live action with animation. And when I heard about the cast of villians,Rene Russo,Jason Alexander,and Robert De Niro....how could it fail?? Well...here's how....
The film starts off promising,with Rocky and Bullwinkle ably voiced by Keith Scott,and of course the brilliant June Foray,complete with a wise cracking narrator!
The film falls apart the minute the writers decided this was going to be a film dumbed down for kids. Did they ever ""get"" the original television show?? Rocky and Bullwinkle was never written as ""just another kids show"". The writers,big kids themselves,knew that their show was for adults,disguised as a kiddie program. Kids could enjoy,and adults would get the witty ""in jokes"". Watching the shows as a child and an adult,I learned this.
So...when Piper Perabo suddenly appears as a teenager in the CIA,claiming ""Rocky & Bullwinkle! I remember them!"". Most viewers won't buy it for a minute. I have nieces older than her,who have no clue who Rocky and Bullwinkle are. So from that point on,you know you're in for a bumpy ride!
Rene Russo is a very sexy Natasha Fatale,Jason Alexander a perfect Boris Badenov....but the high point is Robert De Niro as Fearless Leader! A wonderful,over the top,self parody,that makes you wish the film was only about him! The villians are perfectly cast! And they start out very funny,until the dialogue runs out.
Randy Quiad...definitely belongs in this picture,as does Jonathan Winters,except due to a bad script,they are wasted.
Then there is the animation...it's fine until our heroes enter the ""real world"". You'd think,some ten years later,the effect would be even more eye popping than ""Roger Rabbit""....when in reality,it's about two steps backward.
I am all for childrens films. ""Inspector Gadget"" is a good example of a childrens show made into a childrens film. BUT,Rocky and Bullwinkle are from the ""baby boomer"" era....so why dumb it down to a childrens film,when there are no children awaiting it? Asking Hollywood to think is dangerous,I know.
This film took over three years to get released.(Enough time for Piper Perabo to go from goofy teenager,to teen temptress in ""Coyote ugly"" ).Even that much editing time,didn't help.

The plot: Fearless Leader and his henchmen, Boris Badenov and Natasha Fatale have broken out of Pottysilvania and plan to take over the world by introducing RBTV (Really Bad Television).  If it wasn't bad enough already.  Their plan: hipnotise everyone into following Fearless Leader through the tv channels.

1269105,4,B00003CXJ9,"Des McAnuff's ""The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle"" is something of a minor miracle--a film so clever, intelligent and hysterical that we should all get down on the floor and kiss Hollywood's feet for letting a movie of this caliber escape from Development Hell.  In an era overflowing with pointless remakes of baby-boomer TV shows, the real surprise is not that ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" works so well--it's the fact that it works *at all*.  While many other live-action adaptations of cartoons are cinematic disasters, ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" succeeds because McAnuff and the cast have treated their source material with the utmost reverence.  This is a film built on love and admiration, and the utter delight with which it has been constructed is nothing short of infectious.
The screenplay, by ""Analyze This"" scribe Kenneth Lonergan, is some kind of masterpiece, melding both the unapologetically bad puns of Jay Ward's original series with an abundance of self-referential modern jokes (there are gags involving rap music, the Internet, and fax machines).  But Lonergan has done his homework: the script has been so finely constructed that it doesn't feel any more peculiar to watch our favorite moose and squirrel come to terms with present day technology than it does to hear their traditional puns and wisecracks.
As our story opens, the ever-excitable Narrator (voiced by Keith Scott) informs us that Rocky (voiced by original actress June Foray) and Bullwinkle (Keith Scott again) have grown disillusioned with life in the animated world of Frostbite Falls, Minnesota.  Since their show's cancellation, the heroes have survived on an ever-dwindling number of royalty checks.  Although the plethora of free time allows Bullwinkle to pursue his new passion--saving his hometown's decimated woodlands--both he and Rocky miss the excitement of their by-gone glory days.  Nor has Frostbite Falls itself fared particularly well: the once-scenic town is now a dilapidated slum, and the local economy is so poor that the Narrator himself has been forced to move back in with his mother, narrating the events of his own life to alleviate the boredom.
But opportunity knocks when that dastardly trio of villains, Boris Badanov (Jason Alexander), Natasha Fatale (Rene Russo) and Fearless Leader (Robert De Niro) escape from Cartoon Land and find themselves in the real world.  Fearless Leader wastes no time in ripping off ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" with his plan to take over America: he'll project horrible television shows around the country, programs so inept that even the most brilliant minds in modern society will be turned into quivering bowls of jelly.  (""How is this different from regular television?"" inquires Bullwinkle upon learning of the scheme.)
Like the original television show, much of the film's humor is subtle enough that it will fly right over the head of younger audience members (one of the buildings of Wossamatta U's campus is proudly labeled J-Ward, an homage to the show's creator, the late Jay Ward).  But again, like the original show, there's enough variety in the presentation to make sure everyone comes out smiling.  I must warn you, though: the puns are brutal (one body of water is named Crymia River, and the nation's highest-ranking military officers are General Foods, General Store, and General Admission).  But as any fan of the series knows, merciless puns are to be expected from this particular duo.  Longtime ""Rocky and Bullwinkle"" admirers such as myself are going to be flabbergasted by how much this film feels like the show they know and love.  Don't be scared off by its live-action elements: ""The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle"" is a cinematic gem that gets absolutely everything right.  Sometimes, it seems, you actually can go home again.
Regrettably, Universal's new DVD edition has not given the film the special edition treatment it so richly deserves. It's a disappointingly barren disc, containing little of note apart from a surprisingly tedious ""behind the scenes"" featurette and a few textual supplements. (It also contains only one of the film's theatrical trailers; at least two are known to exist.) Still, it gets the important stuff right: the anamorphic widescreen (1.85:1) transfer looks stellar, and the audio (Dolby Digital 5.1) couldn't be clearer.  Terrific film, but a disappointingly feature-free DVD presentation.",986860800,,4398,5.2703862660944205
1269106,2,B00003CXJ9,The only good thing I can say is I did not fall asleep while watching it.  Poorly acted and directed with the question 'are the old cartoon worth changing into movies?'  If this answer is movies with little to not plot and extremely poor taste here you have them.,984528000,3,263,4.346938775510204
1269107,1,B00003CXJ9,"Oh how disappointing!!!!!
Rocky and Bullwinkle should have been a natural for those of us who grew up with the cartoon.  The simple, yet endearing, themes of the cartoons could have been produced via the marvels of modern computer animation into a funfest for both kids and adults.  Sadly, this attempt missed every single mark.
The story line had promise, but it was left unfulfilled.  The  implementation appeared to be clearly aimed at 4 year olds, except the adult themes and gimicks wouldn't have been understood.  The characters were petty, lacking in charm, and poorly acted.  How, in the name of heaven, did they miss the opportunity to cast Danny DeVito as Boris????  Would have been a natural.  The female lead came across as selfish and inept (but not in a funny way).
It's hard to imagine how they could have made such a stinker out of such a beloved cartoon.",983836800,3,871,4.7218543046357615
1269148,1,B00003CXJ9,This move made Dudley Do-right look like the Piture of the year. I could not believe that Robert DeNiro even was in this movie. This was a movie of has been who even sunk to their lowest by being in it.,983318400,3,202,3.951219512195122
1269149,5,B00003CXJ9,"Great movie that can be enjoyed by the kids as well as adults-takes you back to when you were a kid.
A real bonus that my 2 kids, as well as myself, are really enjoying is the included ""Screen Friends"" voice-activated software for computers that allows them to communicate/navigate the computer via voice commands thru interactive animated characters.  I would have bought the DVD just for that aspect.  Highly recommended!",982195200,,423,5.0285714285714285

A movie this good deserves' better treatment. Hopefully criterion will issue a version in a couple of year. this is destined to be a cult classic.",982195200,,413,4.376623376623376
1269151,1,B00003CXJ9,"This movie was downright PAINFUL to sit through. I actually fell asleep (in the theater, mind you) somewhere past the middle, and that NEVER happens when I am watching a movie! I can enjoy pun oriented humor with the best of them, but this movie was riddled with really, really bad puns. The overly simple plot could have (should have) been compressed to under an hour. It's a shame, because the majority of the cast was top-notch talent; they just weren't given much to work with. From the kids perspective, my nine year old daughter didn't like it either.",977529600,5,557,4.636363636363637
1269152,5,B00003CXJ9,"I enjoyed this movie VERY much.  Watching it put me in a great mood, and  only the best movies can do that.  It was wonderfully funny.  Many  characters in the movie, upon seeing the title characters, would remark,  ""Oh my gosh, it's Rocky and Bullwinkle!!!""  This is how I felt  when I watched it, too: something I had forgotten about until now (though  I'm only 17, so I didn't watch it in the 1960s, but when it was rerun on  Nickelodeon in the early 90s) that has come back and proved that we were  very silly to forget about it.  As funny as the old TV episodes -- which it  has made me want to watch all over again.  It definitely deserves 5 stars.",965001600,,654,4.169354838709677
