8031475,2,B0002T2QZG,the online description didn't warn me that you'd have to be fairly advanced to get anything out of this. Left me in the dust right out of the gate,1365638400,2,146,4.068965517241379
8031476,1,B0002T2QZG,You do not get the book with this order although the description stated that you do.  The DVD has a few pages of the book but that is it.  Huge disappointment.,1302307200,2,159,4.096774193548387

8031478,4,B0002T2QZG,"I bought this DVD thinking I wouldn't need to buy the book edition, but apparently that's not the case since they each cover a lot of different ground (or more precisely the book is more about the techniques and licks, the DVD is more about showing the examples and the players). I think it would have been better had the book been obviated by this DVD so there would be no need to buy both.

The actual content of the DVD, however, is great. Arlen covers a lot of different styles with tabbed/notated examples. He starts out simply and thankfully with some rhythm stuff, then he gives more advanced ideas and techniques. A lot of styles/sounds/techniques are covered. Rock is covered lightly, but this definitely goes more into the blues, rockabilly, country and redneck jazz style of tele playing. Arlen also gives some history of the telecaster and the history of some of the telecasters more famous (and skilled) players over the years.

The real gems, however, are the clips of the guest artists like James Burton, Danny Gatton, Jerry Donahue and a few other great players. Their performances aren't transcribed, but they are inspiring. My personal favorite is the clip with Jerry Donahue. He really tears it up in the short clip!

If you love the ""masters of the telecaster"" and want an inspiring DVD with a ton of licks to learn on it (and you are an intermediate player), then get this. If you just want as many licks/tips as you can get without any of the frills, get the book.",1122768000,27,1486,4.642585551330798
