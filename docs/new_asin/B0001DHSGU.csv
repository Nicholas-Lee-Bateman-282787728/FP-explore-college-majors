1990303,4,B0001DHSGU,"This documentary brings viewers in to the spirit of the suffrage movement and puts the movement into a culturally, historically, politically, and socially specific context of the U.S. and Britain in the latter half of the 19th Century into the early 20th Century.

Although sometimes it seems cheesy, with purposefully bourgeois voices and old-fashioned sets to set the mood, the documentary is surprisingly fast-paced, revealing how dynamic the movement was, with numerous events and leaders continually making progress. However, this can be confusing to students.

Students may bore if watching this full-length video. I recommend either breaking in the middle of it or choosing only a few chapters to show, while filling in the rest of the time-line with lecture. It's hard to determine which parts are most important, but how some of the 1st Wave feminists were racist is an important piece.

The documentary uses Susan Sarandon as the spokesperson and uses Stanton and Anthony's letter-writing as a woman-centered perspective of woman suffrage.",1202688000,34,1049,5.384146341463414
1990304,4,B0001DHSGU,"PBS already produced a DVD about Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton.  I was worried that this would be a rehash.  However, it looked at the suffrage movement with these leaders, but not only these leaders.

I think it's great that this work showed that more than just two women were responsible for the women's vote.  This gives budding feminists more biographies to find and write.  Because the Amendment had to be ratified by 2/3 of states, there is also room for history graduate students to describe what their states did in this regard.  I liked that Susan Sarandon narrated this.  If male actors (Morgan Freeman, Liam Neeson, Harvey Fierstein, etc.) can be narrators, then so should actresses.

Many modern documentaries have people dressed up in costumes imitating the sequences of events.  This work refrains from doing that.  It shows photos and films (yes, films!) from the times.  Otherwise, it would use objects to represent deceased people.  Thus, eyeglasses on a book stand in for Cady Stanton; the paintings in the Senate stand for the 99 men in office at the time.  This film is filled with jingoes and ditties from the time.  They are poignant, but a bit corny.  But hey, rock'n'roll wasn't invented until 30 years after the fact.

This film reiterates how some men have absurd notions that anti-sexism will turn the world upside down.  In the same way that ERA opponents said a law would lead to unisex bathrooms, this film showed men washing clothes and caring for children (Heavens forfend!) as reasons not to support the vote.  In the same way that Limbaugh rants about ""feminazis,"" this film shows Charlie Chaplin (the supposed Communist) mocking suffragettes.

Very importantly, this film shows how racist First Wave feminism was.  It repeatedly showed rich, white woman selling Black women and immigrant women out to cater to their privileged male counterparts.  This happened even though Black women consistently supported the vote, and so did many Black men.  Further, though Woodrow Wilson was so supposedly progressive, in the same way that he prevented civil rights for Blacks, he only halfheartedly supported women.

Finally, male viewers will be put at ease by this work.  Not only were their supportive men at the Seneca Convention, it was a man who wanted to honor his mother that made the Amendment possible.  The film shows supportive men of the time as well as having a male scholar chime in.",1143158400,96,2437,4.943349753694581
1990316,5,B0001DHSGU,"Oh my goodness, is this a vital and moving story for every woman to see.  What it took to gain the vote and highlight the issue of  women's rights.  This is the story of the beginning--one that even today, is still an ongoing struggle on many fronts.

1990317,5,B0001DHSGU,"A great PBS documentary that is an excellent source for understanding how women were finally able to obtain the vote.
It captures the strength and willingness of women to do what it took to make the final push for women to vote.",1387065600,2,228,4.4523809523809526
1990318,5,B0001DHSGU,"I originally viewed this on loan from the library and thought it so good I just had to have my own copy. If I could require everyone in America to view one video, this might be it. It is a vivid portrayal of the dedication, persistence, organizational skill and political savvy of the women fighting for the vote and, most powerfully, their courage as they challenged entrenched social rules, and the hatred and the violence they had to face. It's hard to imagine now that the idea of women voting could arouse such anger and vehement opposition. But we should know--lest we forget!",1370822400,3,582,4.660194174757281

1990321,5,B0001DHSGU,"I ordered this at the same time I ordered ""Iron Jawed Angels"" with Hilary Swank.
This video is far better and more interesting unless you like hype, soapy drama, out of period music and dialog.
This is more like something Ken Burns would do, and the photos, accuracy, and historical timeline are a lot easier to follow than the ""...Angels"" drama.",1316995200,17,346,4.688524590163935
