My expectation is that it would cover, in depth, the features and functions of the GPS unit that were only given cursory coverage in the users guide that came with the device. The fact is, that the video only reiterates the limited information that was in the users guide.

Not worth very much..",1376611200,2,377,4.385714285714286
