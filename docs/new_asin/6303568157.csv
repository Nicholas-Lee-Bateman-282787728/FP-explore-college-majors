7850207,5,6303568157,"Absolutely well done biography of Hank Williams Jr.
Overbearing Mom but she did help him get started.
Thank god he got a wake up call and survived the excesses of the music/ Hollywood life....
""John Boy""..does a great job as far as I'm concerned, shows the guts of standing up to the old Guard trying to make him a mini-me...... Comes out as his own man... A true American original!

Where's the DVD version?!",1473206400,,409,4.527027027027027

7850209,3,6303568157,"Just how much of this film is true, and how much fiction is probably known only to the actual persons who lived out this story. It's entertaining as most such films are. To those only familiar with Hanks beard and sunglasses look, Richard Thomas may seem an odd choice to play him. But he bears a close resemblance to the young Hank Jr. Although at five eight, he's way off the mark of Hanks six-foot-three. Hank himself was at first disaproving of the choice as he wanted Jeff Bridges to play his part. Thomas carries it off well in this roller coaster ride of Hanks early years as he's caught up in a life of hand me down fame, constant drinking and easy women. Then almost loses his life to the same demons that destoyed his father.",1246060800,,735,4.372262773722627
7850210,5,6303568157,"I had a (very) small role in Living Proof, and I'm so glad it's finally available on video. One of my favorite memories was auditioning for Richard Thomas, whose wife had recently delivered triplets! It was a ""cattle call"" sort of audition here in Nashville, and I played my guitar and sang a couple verses of ""Rollin' in My Sweet Baby's Arms"" for him. The hiring call came a couple days later and I spent three days working on the set and in Nashville's Tennessee Performing Arts Center, filming what turned out to be two scenes spliced into one song at the end of the movie. I played guitar in the ""hip"" band at the very end. Playing other music in between takes to entertain the audience of hired extras (while the balloons were reloaded into the ceiling!) was a blast! I even got to lead a rousing version of ""Turn Your Radio On."" This was a band composed of professional musicians of extremely high quality (myself excepted, of course, though I do pick a little).
Richard Thomas is a gentleman and a talented actor who puts his whole heart into his performance in this film. All in all, it's a fun t.v. movie and great entertainment, especially the song at the end!",975715200,12,1170,4.497652582159624
