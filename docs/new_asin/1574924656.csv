Not only does it do an excellent job of portraying the struggle of a people but enables you to see all prospectives involved, namely those of the white South African community.  My whole family is inspired by the life of Mr. Mandela and all those involved.  And after seeing  this version of the circumstances, I was able to see the sacrifices of Mr. DeKlerk also!  I am inspired to achieve those visions in my own life and not to fear what man or society may do to me!

195279,5,1574924656,"This story should be a part of our world history textbooks. It is a rare glimpse into the lives of these two natural antagonists. It shows how one can be an antagonist, oppose unrighteousness, and still be a gentleman in the process. Even though politics were mean and even brutal, the view of these two men, at the nexus of history in a positive way, is a respite from the extreme feelings that can be generated by apartheid, its victims (black South Africans), and its opposers (the world finally and almost too late). I show this (and other historical documentaries) to my nieces and nephews when they come to visit.",1404086400,,619,4.636363636363637
195280,5,1574924656,I absolutely loved this movie. I first watched it thru Netflix and then loved it so much I ordered it here! I never realized that Nelson Mandela spent almost 20 years IN JAIL FIRST BEFORE BECOMING PRESIDENT ANT THAT HE WAS PUT THER BE THE PEOPLE SO HE WAS OFTEN CALLED THE PEOPLE'S PRESIDENT!

The movie shows that F.W De Klerk ( Unlike Botha ) was willing to compromise with Mandela and despite their differences during De Klerk's Presidency, they worked together to end Apartied. Michael Caine's performance as De Klerk was exceptional!.",1343520000,2,439,5.027397260273973

195285,5,1574924656,"""Mandela and de Klerk"" is a 1997 made-for-TV docudrama that a history buff shouldn't miss.  I didn't even know of this until this month (Could this have been so under the radar or was my rock difficult to climb out of?).  The film chronicles the efforts of then South African President Frederik Willem de Klerk to release anti-apartheid activist Nelson Mandela from prison and pave the way for a new constitution and abolishment of apartheid.  This is, of course, an extremely simplified synopsis of the film.  The film itself is quite complex, primarily because the central characters - Mandela and de Klerk - are complex individuals, as one would expect of history makers.  Their relationship was cagey at best, and both men seem larger than life, skillfully bartering with the powers they held and keeping at bay the forces that would have easily exploded into civil war.  Add to this the magic that is Poitier and Caine, and I assure you, this will be one of the best hour-and-a-half you'll spend.

The negotiations between the two central characters dominate the film.  To fully appreciate these exchanges, I found it helpful to brush up on some basics (e.g., the African National Congress and its raison d'etre, Die Groot Krokodil or P.W. Botha, the staunch defender of apartheid, etc.).  Even without these preparations, the film is so expertly plotted and scripted that the viewer walks away having learned a great deal of Pres. Mandela's intelligence and struggles, and appreciating the equally intelligent and progressive Afrikaner, de Klerk.  As god-like as they would seem, I admired the filmmaker's refusal to deify both men.  They are depicted as the very real people that they are, faults and all.  They resent each other, they attack each other, they abhor each other, and they make grand history together.  What a film!",1212796800,6,1836,4.980327868852459

195287,4,1574924656,"I have not figured out, why someone like Spike Lee ,has not done a film about Nelson Mandela yet. He could have cast Morgan Freeman. He was in the excellent short film ,'Death of a Prophet'(1972),about the remaining days of Malcolm X's life. This film ,'Mandela and deKlerk',is above average. But, would have done better if it had stayed true with his autobiographical story,'The Long Walk to Freedom'.I saw the deKlerk role as a filler and the film focusing less on Mandela's political struggle and search for equal justice. The long walk to freedom is not just Mandela's personal struggle and for his Afrikan people but all just people of the world. Let's hope another film takes a closer look at Nelson Mandela's story and credo. Before history repeats itself.",1166140800,5,763,4.876923076923077
195288,5,1574924656,this Made for TV Movie truly Captures so many Elements within the South African Commnunity. MR.Mandala&Mr. Deklerk were Portrayed Very Strongly respectively by Sidney Poitier&Michael Caine. A Strong Performance.,1046995200,3,211,6.310344827586207

Hot Toasty Rag, November 22, 2017

Sidney Poitier plays Nelson Mandela in this television biopic Mandela and de Klerk. The film focuses on the later years of Mandelas imprisonment, giving only five minutes or so in the beginning to the first twenty years. This story shows his relationship with his wife Winnie, played by Tina Lifford, and the politically changing climate in South Africa. Gerry Maritz and Michael Caine, playing P.W. Botha and F.W. de Klerk respectively, have lots of meetings with their political cohorts to decide how to handle the social situation, as well as debating the political gains and detriments that would coincide with potentially freeing Mandela.

While there is a very small side-plot that references Mandelas friendship with guard James Gregory, played by Ben Kruger, I wouldnt have even noticed that the real-life tidbit was included if I hadnt previously seen The Color of Freedom, a film starring Dennis Haysbert and Joseph Fiennes, that focused solely on that friendship.

All in all, the film feels a little cheap and obviously made for television. But, if you really like Mandela biographies, you can rent this movie to compare performances and help you choose a favorite actor among the many who have played him. While Sidney Poitier and Michael Caine don't look anything like the men they're portraying, they try very hard to do South African accents. Both speak very convincingly for about nine words, and on the tenth word they accidentally revert to their usual voices. But, it is a very difficult accent to master, so you can cut them a little slack if youd like.",1511308800,,1640,4.978102189781022
