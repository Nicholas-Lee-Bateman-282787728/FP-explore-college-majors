8256025,5,B0014LP1FI,"Looked like a homemade movie at first, but you must understand that's the way most movies were made during the mid 90's. The special effects are so-so, adult scenes are more toned down compared to the Anime version, but the only thing that really stood out were the tentacles. Its a lot different from the animated version to also let you know. If you seen the anime,watch this. If not read more about this movie before getting it.",1442534400,,431,4.538461538461538
