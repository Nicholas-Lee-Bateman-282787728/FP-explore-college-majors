The only problem is that I've only seen this movie for sale without English subtitles.  The movie had English subtitles in theaters and don't understand why they haven't come out with a dvd version with the subtitles also.  I would think 2 years going by (released in 2010) that an english subtitled version would be made available.  Good movie, funny, and recommended.  Also, I would highly recommend to anyone who either enjoys overseas films or just a great film in general to watch ""the man from nowhere"".  I would consider it a cross between ""Taken"" and ""the professional."" one of the best movies i've seen of recent.",1338681600,,714,4.672
