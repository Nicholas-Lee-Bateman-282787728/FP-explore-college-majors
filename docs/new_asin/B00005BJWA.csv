1424787,3,B00005BJWA,"I've got every other Cynthia Rothrock movie.  This was ""ok"", however the fight scenes weren't choreographed very well and Ms. Rothrock didn't show very much in the few fight scenes that she did.  The acting was a bit lame, and ""Tiger Claws"" was much better.  This would be a good movie to have if your just a Cynthia Rothrock collector and don't really care too much about the movie quality.",1342396800,,391,4.557142857142857
1424788,3,B00005BJWA,"When the history of low-budget martial arts cinema is written, the ""Tiger Claws"" trilogy isn't going to rank strongly against the likes of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/No-Retreat-No-Surrender/dp/B0002848WQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">No Retreat, No Surrender</a>&nbsp;series or the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kickboxer/dp/0783114885/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kickboxer</a>&nbsp;bunch when considering its thoroughly run-of-the-mill opener, its unaccountably weird finale, and this bridge of a middle act that mixes parts of both. That doesn't mean it ought to be ignored, though, if only for being a solid set of vehicles for Cynthia Rothrock, a fun little excursion for Bolo Yeung (who'd leave the series after this one), and pretty much the only starring films Jalal Merhi can watch and be proud of. That's pretty much what ""Tiger Claws 2"" is, as well as a rounded DTV karate outing...with some faults. Come, fans.

The story: when imprisoned martial arts serial killer Chong (Yeung,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodsport/dp/B00006RCOC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodsport</a>) is rescued en route to his trial by his brother Dai Lo Fu (Ong Soo Han,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodsport-2/dp/B00005MM61/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodsport 2</a>) - a crime lord and occult leader who's also employed a dangerous arms dealer (Evan Lurie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hologram-Man/dp/B000EXDRMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hologram Man</a>) - it's up to Tarek Richards (Jalal Merhi,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Talons-of-the-Eagle/dp/B00020HB46/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Talons of the Eagle</a>) and Linda Masterson (Cynthia Rothrock,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Above-the-Law/dp/B000NVT0RK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Above the Law</a>) to reunite and stop their plan to harness mystic powers...

In addition to the aforementioned names, the cast also boasts Eric Lee (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ring-of-Fire/dp/6305382441/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ring of Fire</a>) as the thought-dead sensei of Chong and Dai Lo and Paul Rapovski (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Extreme-Challenge/dp/B000066755/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Extreme Challenge</a>) as a main henchman, as well as about a dozen unnamed but thoroughly noteworthy fighters; making for a pretty sweet B-movie ensemble. The only problem here is that many of the performers aren't used to their full potential, in one way or another: on one hand, you've got plenty of character interaction between Bolo and Han, but they hardly fight (Han doesn't even have a single one-on-one match), and on the other hand, Cynthia Rothrock supplies some nice brawls but otherwise feels like a bit player in her own movie. Then there's Eric Lee, who not only doesn't get to fight but also has his voice dubbed the entire time. Geez.

When everybody does get to fight, though, it's good - sometimes very good - but you'll have to wait almost an hour into the movie to get beyond split-second encounters and down to the real martial arts fighting. Again, it's disappointing that Han, Lee, and Bolo don't get to show off their considerable talents much, but the remaining stars (and non-stars) really step to the plate to make up for this. The choreography trumps that of the first movie, with faster brawls, less restrictive editing, and a much greater variety of fighting styles represented. The last twenty minutes or so are an almost nonstop fight scene, featuring Cynthia taking on a tae kwon do fellow and a stick-wielding Paul Rapovski with a wooden bench while Jalal Merhi has a one-on-one fight with Evan Lurie that was better than anything I'd imagined Merhi capable of. Anybody with experience in flicks like these will know that ""Beirut's Steven Seagal"" was never Van Damme, but dangit if the showdown he has in here isn't a perfectly respectable one.

The introduction of supernatural elements as a plot point (Dai Lo's trying to take Evan Lurie's weapons back in time to do...something) comes as a really weird twist after the first movie was played as straight as it was, but when considering what&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tiger-Claws-3/dp/B00005JXYL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tiger Claws 3</a>&nbsp;turned out to be, I guess this is the friendly middle ground of the series. Production values are decent and there were enough subtle weirdo moments to make even the boring scenes a little interesting (e.g. to fool policemen, Chong masquerades as a french fry vendor and serves them frozen fries), but nevertheless, I still give my nod to the first installment of the trilogy above the others: its characters were better developed and it did a better job of balancing the story with the butt-kicking. Fans of the first ought to find this one worth the price, though, with Jalal Merhi followers in particular having reason to get excited.",1288828800,,5262,6.5997109826589595
1424789,3,B00005BJWA,"I'll start off by being honest and saying I have not seen part 1 yet.  There were some clips at the beginning of this film from part 1, and they looked somewhat decent...mostly the Bolo Young character in some fight scenes.  At first I was not expecting much from this movie, and really bought it cause it had one of my favorite B-movie martial arts villains, Bolo Young.  I realized that the overall cast list was pretty good, consisting of Bolo, Jalal Merhi, Cynthia Rothrock, Eric Lee, Evan Lurie, and Ong Soo Han.  There are even plenty of other extra guys, with great physicall build and abilities for the martial arts tournament in the film.  I was prepared for some great fights among some great movie martial artists.

Most of the movie has a pretty good feel to it, and I think the music helps a lot - it almost sound like similar music used in Terminator 3.  Pacing was good and I actually never realized that there wasn't too much action taking place.  By the end of the film I longed for the action, and was pleased to see there was a tournament.  The fights were short though, and only a few were decent.  Bolo gets to fight too, but only in a couple of very short fights.  The biggest dissapointment was the use of Ong Soo Han and Eric Lee, yet without little to no fighting from the 2 and both usually have excellent fights in most of their movies.  Ong Soo Han's character's fate was a huge disappointment.  The other big dissapointment was the finale with Bolo - I was hoping for a great fight scene with him and Jalal or Cynthia - didn't happen.  He uses a few seconds of Tiger Claws on some guys, but its pretty stupid when each time he executes, the sound of a roaring tiger follows.

The plus is the final fights between the Cynthia Rothrock charcater and a couple of bad guys, and the Jalal Merhi charcater vs the bad guy character played by Evan Lurie, which ended up being the best fight of the movie - more evenly matched and longer.

Tiger Claws 2 ends up being average overall.  The decent list of characters should have provided an extremely great action movie, but the best guys don't get to fight much.  Hopefully Tiger Claws 3 will have a great fight with Bolo...oh wait he isn't in part 3....major doh!",1161216000,3,2234,4.407317073170732
1424790,4,B00005BJWA,"A good Martial Arts B movie. This is one of my Bolo Yeung Favorites, he is just dirty in this flick. Both 1 & 2 are good, 1 is better. Why is Tiger Claws 1 not on DVD but 2&3 are? I don't know what they are thinking but I like to see my movies in order! Wait for part one on DVD First(on Widscreen) before buying two.
Nuff said!",1013126400,7,328,3.7

7937832,4,B00005BJWA,"I've seen this movie back in the 90s, so I'm a bit biased. As a sequel, it isn't bad. While the first movie has generally more to it, and fits better in the 90s martial arts action movie genre, the second one certainly has its own edge. While the script, action and fight choreography may seem dated and dull by modern standards, I can appreciate its few unique features, and the generally unexpected take on Bolo Young's character alone is worth watching the movie at least once.",1394150400,,480,4.528735632183908

Cynthia Rothrock is the best martial-arts actress I have ever seen, and she is For-Real, and she is a good actress, as well.  I have purchased a lot of her movies.  I hope she will make a few more movies, unless she is getting too old (no disrespect intended), to kick the crap out of the bad guys!  She is my favorite martial-arts actress.",1374537600,,425,4.25
