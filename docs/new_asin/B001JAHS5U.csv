3657534,5,B001JAHS5U,"I have been waiting for 6 months after pre-oredering this, to show up at my door step. What the heck is going on here. No other show takes this long to be released on pre-order. What gives? This is just unacceptable. If someone wants an immoral  show like Simpsons or Filth in the city, they get it in a matter of weeks. But if you want good comedy that the whole family can enjoy, you have to wait years and years. Get season 5 and 6 out to us ASAP! Is that too much to ask!",1335484800,25,475,3.9479166666666665

3657537,5,B001JAHS5U,I love the BNS and have seasons 1-4.  I used to watch it in the 70's with Mom and Dad.  I think it's so dear to my heart because my dad favored Bob Newhart..in both his wit and snappy fashion style. :)  Please release it soon.  Thanks!,1324512000,20,235,3.9361702127659575
3657538,1,B001JAHS5U,The rating is not for the show but for the delay.  Why is it taking so long to get these seasons of one of the best TV shows of all time to DVD?  What do we have to do?  We want to all go about this in a legal way but it seems that we are being pushed to illegal means in order to obtain these shows.  I'm sure I could get them from numerous vendors throughout Thailand.  It would not surprise me if these two seasons are already available for download off the internet.  But some of us want to spend our money legally.  And thanks to Fox it seems like we may never be able to.,1324252800,5,577,3.8389830508474576
3657539,5,B001JAHS5U,"Why the release of seasons five and six are held up is anybody's guess, considering some of the crap that gets put out on DVD. C'mon Fox, get with it!",1313712000,8,150,4.033333333333333
3657540,2,B001JAHS5U,"As someone that bought the first season of The Bob Newhart Show, I must say I was disappointed in the poor quality. I mean that while other series have character pictures and are one sided DVDs this set was two sided. There are still some channels broadcasting the series and even though they are the cut-up syndicated version, it was better than what I bought. Wait for someone responsible like Shout Factory to do it right.
Try Hulu, it may be there.",1313280000,5,452,4.524390243902439
3657541,5,B001JAHS5U,"Thanks for finally putting out seasons five and six of the BNS after so many years of waiting.  I watched this show growing up in the 70's because my parents watched it as part of the infamous Saturday night lineup.  Some of my favorite episodes are
in the last two seasons.  Suzanne Pleshette was my favorite; I liked her so much better than the wife on the Newhart show because she and Bob had so much chemistry together they really seemed to be a couple.  It scares me that there is no actual release date at the time I'm writing this but I'm hoping that's temporary :)",1312848000,7,572,4.317757009345795
3657542,5,B001JAHS5U,"Uggh, just got the news from Amazon, Season 5 and 6 were cancelled.  OK, where do we go from here?  Fortunately I recorded all of them and converted to mpegs and put on CD, so I can watch them, but I was really looking forward to unedited, higher quality prints than what I have.  Who owns the rights to this?  Time to start a campaign to get Shout Factory to do them.  Not giving up, folks!",1312502400,8,391,4.092105263157895

8312710,2,B001JAHS5U,"Not having seen these shows in a while, I'd forgotten how mediocre they were.  Season 5 is OK, but shows decline in the writing.  Howard acts more ridiculous than silly/funny (as in ""too much"") and the show looks tired.  Newhart had wanted to end after 5 seasons, but was talked into a 6th by CBS.  I think he had it right the first time.

Season 6 is, frankly, lousy.  The plots and the scripts are just bad, and Newhart  doesn't even appear (save for a brief cameo in each) in the last  several episodes.  He returns for the finale, which is just so-so.

I've had the DVDs for the first 4 seasons for years and enjoy them.  But, unless you REALLY have to have them, I would say save your money on these last two.",1430870400,,714,4.214814814814815

And don't worry about ""The Bob Newhart Show - The Final Season"" getting a DVD release, because it's coming out the exact same day!""",1415232000,,273,4.591836734693878
8312712,5,B001JAHS5U,"These seasons are truly wonderful and I'm very much looking forward to owning them. Both Amazon.ca and BB are listing the complete series with a release date of 05/27/2014. Amazon.ca says they are being released through Shout Factory. http://www.amazon.ca/Bob-Newhart-Show-Complete-Series/dp/B00HRUQB5O It looks like the retail is $120. I already own S1-4, but I just know I'll bite the bullet and gift the ones I already have.

8312714,5,B001JAHS5U,"So glad to read that other viewers are waiting for the release of Seasons 5 and 6 of Bob Newhart Show.  I've enjoyed the first 4 seasons, but now I want the rest and the wait time has been ridiculous!  What is the hold up?  There are plenty of Bob's fans who are waiting---please, Fox, hurry up!",1383177600,,295,4.140350877192983
8312715,5,B001JAHS5U,"First of all, The Bob Newhart Show is a classic comedy.  Well written, well acted, and always funny.  I have seasons 1 thru 4 and was excited when Amazon offered 5 & 6 as pre-order. That was 18 months ago.  Still waiting!  What's the deal?  Either release these seasons or don't, but why is it taking so long? Ridiculous to have something on pre-order for going on two years!",1368144000,4,375,4.3768115942028984
8312716,5,B001JAHS5U,"I gave it 5 stars because I own Seasons 1-4, which I love. I have been waiting a long time for Seasons 5 and 6 to be released.  I hope the folks at MTM productions release these two seasons soon.",1365033600,3,195,3.875
8312717,5,B001JAHS5U,I love this show! I ordered seasons 5 and 6 in July of 2011. Maybe the DVDs will be out in 2013.,1358726400,2,96,3.409090909090909
8312718,5,B001JAHS5U,"Like others here, I'm wondering if the final seasons of one of the most durable, laugh-out-loud sit-coms of all time
will ever be released. I bought Season 1 for a song when Borders went out of business,
expecting a series I loved at the time to have dated badly. It hadn't.
A great cast, with fine, funny writers and performed (I believe) before a live audience
I quickly caught up and, like the rest of you, have a feeling that I've pre-ordered
a box-set that, inexplicably, will never be released. When already? Ever?",1346025600,6,520,4.602150537634409
8312719,5,B001JAHS5U,"I pre-ordered this DVD on August 3, 2011.

It has been over one year and there is still no word from FOX on when, or if ever, the last two seasons of The Bob Newhart Show will be released.

Shame on FOX for their shabby treatment of Mr. Bob Newhart, a man who has entertained millions of people for over 50 decades.

FOX simply has no respect for the true entertainment legends of our time or today's consumers.

The fact that FOX did not remaster the original films in seasons 1-4 is a disgrace.

The big question is why FOX will not sell the license or allow ShoutFactory! to release the remaining seasons if they believe they will lose money. It must be personal.",1345420800,14,666,4.338709677419355
