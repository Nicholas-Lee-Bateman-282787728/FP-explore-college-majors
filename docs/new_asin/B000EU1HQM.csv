2534162,5,B000EU1HQM,I've watched and rewatched this film and all the special features.  I simply love the whole package.  I has lots of tools for a more fun and intelligent life.,1150588800,2,158,4.413793103448276
2534163,4,B000EU1HQM,"Robert Anton Wilson believed that there is no meaning in life; that meaning is in sentences. As a result, all perceptions are considered gambles: we believe what we see and then we believe our interpretations to be reality, not realizing that our interpretations are just interpretations. So we all perceive the world from the point of view of our individual ""reality tunnels,"" and there is no vantage point from which ""real"" reality can be seen. Once one realizes that everyone else is looking through their own reality tunnel or grid or focus, it is easier to empathize, understand, and even forgive others. And if we are willing and able to tune in and listen, non-judgmentally, to other perceptions, we may learn something interesting about our world.

This DVD is well-produced and well worth watching for the compelling ideas and the humor of a man who challenged traditional Aristolian ""either/or, yes/no"" notions of logic (in favor of the ""maybe logic"" of quantum mechanics) and who refused to let his intellect and emotions be usurped by ideological dogma.

What I found particularly interesting, though, was Douglas Rushkoff's take on the element of danger inherent in R. Wilson's philosophy: ""The biggest thing I got from Bob is that all of our reality constructs are models. All of them are approximations, are metaphors, are allegories for what's going on, and that we live in a world where we are all negotiating on behalf of our stories. We each create a story, a narrative, a picture, an allegory, a model for what's going on here and then we fight, sometimes to the death, to make others, if not believe in that model, we fight to be able to keep believing in it ourselves. So we try to erase contradictory evidence to that model. But it also becomes [to the point] where I end up parting ways philosophically with him, too. I get the feeling that Bob is not just _aspiritual_, but that he's _anti-spiritual_. He doesn't believe in God or Spirit or a special super-reality connecting us all--because it's not there, because it's not evident, because it's not apparent. And I feel in a way like Bob's world view, having passed through The Chapel Perilous of Wonder, that his view now is that, 'Well, there's nothing. This is it. Period.' As far as I'm concerned, the idea that there's nothing is just another, What if? It's the skeptic in _Cosmic Trigger_. It's the skeptic's world view. But it's just a world view. And I don't think it's any intrinsically _safer_.""",1184457600,3,2482,4.83764705882353
2534164,4,B000EU1HQM,"The video was an excellent way to get a glimpse of a genius on his way out.  RAW should be required reading in the schools, except we really wouldn't want a nation full of free thinkers.  More to the point, if you haven't read him, please do so. Especially ""Prometheus Rising"" and the ""Cosmic Trigger"" series.  Sad to see him go, but he did it with dignity.  A great man/mind.",1182988800,2,376,4.328571428571428
2534165,4,B000EU1HQM,"I watched this DVD the other day, and it became my introduction to Bob. It was liberating for me to find that he articulates with great clarity and detail many of the ideas I have been contemplating in the past several months. I agree with virtually every point he brings up. I'll have to watch it a few more times to give a better review, because my mind is still just opening to such a heightened level of awareness. One of the great thinkers of our time.",1176768000,3,457,4.264367816091954
2534166,4,B000EU1HQM,"I don't imagine you're looking at this item not knowing who Robert Anton Wilson is.  If you don't like him or understand him, this video won't change anything.  This video is for those who want to see the man talk about what you've already read in his books.  Some of its verbatim.

Be warned that the video plays like a cheesy amateur school project.  There's constant nagging background music and blocky unnecessary animation distractions.  Personally, I don't mind, I think it's charming.  I enjoy listening to the man talk.",1173657600,4,527,4.853932584269663
2534167,4,B000EU1HQM,"If you've never encountered Robert Anton Wilson, skip this DVD and buy yourself a copy of Illuminatus! (fiction, writen with Robert Shea) or Quantum Psychology (non-fiction).

If you're already a fan of Wilson's work, you're unlikely to learn anything new here; but you'll probably enjoy yourself all the same. If, like me, you never got the chance to met Wilson in person, this is probably as close as we'll get to sitting down for a chat with elderly ""Uncle Bob"". There's also a random assortment of material of varying quality from earlier in his life.

My recommendation in brief: read some of his books first, then leave this video playing on your TV as you go about your daily chores and let Uncle Bob worm his way into your brain.",1171756800,7,737,4.661538461538462
2534168,5,B000EU1HQM,"I'd never heard of Robert Anton Wilson, however it was listed in the recommendations so I checked it out and decided to buy it.

As I have since found out, Mr Wilson does jump around a lot.... and so does this movie.  It shows him at various ages but I believe that keeps the movie from becoming tedious.

Definitely reminds me of Timothy Leary.

So now I'm buying his books.",1170892800,3,375,4.314285714285714
2534169,1,B000EU1HQM,"I had great expectations when I ordered this DVD on strength of these reviews. I was sadly disappointed as the DVD does not do justice to a great mind. Maybe it is the only opportunity to see and hear the real Anton Wilson talk on a variety of subjects. But shoot the film editor! It is poorly put together with the most irritating ""front-ground"" music totally obscuring the narration. If is not fair to present a portrait of a genius so unprofessionally. Rather read his books.",1165881600,15,478,4.569767441860465
2534170,5,B000EU1HQM,"In Maybe Logic BoB Anton Wilson Explains Everything from Quantum Physics to J. Z. Knight aka Ramtha (from ""What the Bleep Do We Know"") and never gets boring.

I've owned this since it's original release in 2003 and I've watched it 8 times, and every time I do I learn something new and deeper then I did before. Robert Anton Wilson is the Mother load and his ideas are both simple and complex. Simple in that a person feels like they get them at first encounter but you can keep going deeper with what RAW teaches and if you truly got it, I feel, you'd be left simply loving.

...and maybe a little pissed off that others, like George Bush, are trying to keep you from being simply that way.

I've also listened to Robert Anton Wilson Explains Everything (or old bob exposes his ignorance) once a year since I first purchased it 5 years ago and recommend it highly. Does he explain everything, Maybe! Like the DVD each time I experience it I understand new things or in a different more beneficial way then I ever did before.

Now that I've seen this again and again I realized WoW BoB explains both Taoism and Yoga and what it means to understand the true meaning of Mystical Enlightenment and now I get it!

Even if you don't get it like I get it but you get it in your own unique individial way RAW will make you more intelligent, more free, and more understanding, and benevolent. He is a brilliant, wise, humble, and very funny man!

Check out RAW, he's life changing!",1162771200,7,1473,4.397058823529412
2534171,4,B000EU1HQM,"Video clips of Wilson over much of his career.  You'll enjoy seeing him move and speak if you're a Wilson fan (I am).  If you're not, don't bother.  The video quality is not first class, but practically every frame has Robert Anton Wilson in it.  What more could you want?  Someday, anthropologists will look at this and know we weren't just a bunch of neanderthal Republicans.",1162684800,4,377,4.651515151515151
2534172,5,B000EU1HQM,"... I can say this unequivocally regarding Robert Anton Wilson. The man's wit and glittering intelligence is utterly phenomenal. His humor and light is infectious. This DVD is essential viewing because it is the only place I know of where one can see and hear the man. Robert Anton Wilson's books have changed my life. He has entertained, dazzled, and enthralled me, helping me to become a more enlightened, intelligent, and compassionate person in the process. It made me incredibly sad to hear that RAW is having major financial difficulties right now in the Twilight of his amazing life. This is a grave injustice. It boggles my mind that this incredible man is not more known. The fact that he has such a brilliant and relevant oeuvre of work, yet is penniless actually makes me want to cry (and nothing ever makes me feel that way).

If you are reading this review, you no doubt are familiar with RAW's amazing books. You need to purchase this DVD immediately. Not only will it help RAW financially, it will also help you. If you have not read any of RAW's books but happened to serendipitously stumble across this DVD, I highly recommend reading one of them first. 'Schrdinger's Cat' is possibly my favorite fiction book of all time. 'Prometheus Rising' is an amazing life-changing operator's manual for the infinitely lovely human brain. Either of these books or 'Cosmic Trigger' would be perfect entry points into the one-of-a-kind body of work put forth by RAW.

I realize I have not talked much about the DVD, and therefore this may not be the most affective review... however, whilst bumbling around Amazon, I happened upon this DVD (which I purchased 3 years ago), and felt instantly and very strongly compelled to give it my glowing endorsement. This is more of an endorsement for the amazing polymath Robert Anton Wilson, than anything else. That being said, if you are a fan of RAW, you MUST purchase this DVD immediately. It is touching, intelligent, fascinating, entertaining, and like nothing else- just like Robert Anton Wilson...",1161907200,24,2049,4.885057471264368

8114222,5,B000EU1HQM,One of my favorite DVDs that I get out twice a year to watch to clear out the mental cobwebs and take a good look at my own reality tunnel.,1409875200,,139,3.6666666666666665
8114223,5,B000EU1HQM,"Love this. RAW was kind of the coolest guy ever... if you're a fan of his books, buy this and check him out.",1366761600,,108,3.739130434782609
8114224,5,B000EU1HQM,"Robert Anton Wilson or RAW (as I have begun using to refer to his quotables on Twitter @KenjiSummers) is one of my favorite sages. This DVD is like a highlight reel of the best lines and clips from over 20 years of RAW. Personally I watch this DVD everyday because it serves as a reminder to stay curious and experiment. The DVD is produced just like all low production value videos you will find of RAW on YouTube. You can find a full version of ""Maybe Logic"" on YouTube, however, I enjoy being able to watch this footage on my TV screen so I decided to purchased the DVD. RAW will make you think, see, and hear things in alternative ways that you may not have considered. Don't let indecisiveness keep you from experiencing the humor, wit, and wisdom of this polymath!

8114225,5,B000EU1HQM,"This documentary will challenge your views on reality in good ways... if you aren't already challenging them yourself and even then probably still would.

It tackles issues of the nature of the mind and the nature of reality and existence.",1328572800,,239,4.975
8114226,5,B000EU1HQM,"This review is only my perception of the documentary, and should not be considered an attempt at objectively rating this since I have subjective views, like a lot of you out there. I will not try and pass it off as a review of the actual thing.

If you're trying to decide if you'd like to buy this DVD, head over to YouTube to watch the entire video before making up your mind. For me, I re-watch this DVD at least every 6 months, noticing new aspects Bob mentions and finding various things he says true, from the point of view of my experiences at those points in my life.

Above his scientific method and his cutting wit, what Bob has illuminated me with most has been the sense of humour he lived his life with, which has spread happiness (to me, and affected those close to me). I still haven't decided if Bob was the best conman or the head of the illuminati himself - he definitely has fired up unused neurons in my brain and I will be thankful to him all my life.

Another beautiful thing he's done is turn me onto other great authors and thinkers. If you search on youtube for 'Robert Anton Wilson explains everything', there are various long interviews, I say watch this documentary (on DVD or for free, Bob wouldn't care) and then head over to get some of his writings and/or interviews to delve deeper.

My advice to you: Watch this documentary, it could be the most important thing you do in your life, I really mean that!",1306627200,,1436,4.367041198501872
8114227,2,B000EU1HQM,"I loved listening to Robert Anton Wilson. However, the quality of the visuals (with badly done transitions) and the extremely irritating constant music (mostly gloop and bleep noises) made me turn it off half way through.

Can somebody who is a professional video editor please re-release this item in better quality?",1249084800,8,317,5.215686274509804
8114228,3,B000EU1HQM,"I thought to type out a review of the documentary but the guy directly below me already wrote almost word for word what I imagine I was going to. So I'll just give my 2 cents on Robert Anton Wilson here. I like Wilson a lot. He's an interesting, sometimes fascinating guy. He's likable, obviously smart, and a very imaginative writer. I consider Wilson above all a fascinating conversationalist, wonderful story teller, and great humanitarian. And he's a humorist and useful social commentator. Now don't be mad reading this --because why should you care what I think anyway?-- but in my 'reality tunnel' RAW is a philosophical lightweight. Sorry. Sorry, but RAW is not a great philosopher like his crazy friend Timothy Leary claimed. Of course Leary had reason to praise Wislon, who was a great promoter of his ideas. No offense to fans intended at all. (Just compare to say...Bertrand Russell, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Martin Heidegger, Robert Brandom, or even John Searle, Richard Rorty, Hillary Putnam, Dan Dennet, etc. etc. There is no real comparison between Wilson and world class philosophers.) But look, Douglas Rushkoff says that Wilson is the only one of his famous heroes that wasn't a disappointment to meet in person (He's met some famous people that were his heroes including Leary). That is saying something, is it not? If you know Rushkoff it is. And that Wilson has influenced a guy as sharp and important a social commentator as Rushkoff demonstrates he has indeed made a positive impact. I think RAW was maybe good at bricolage. Reading RAW reminds me of my experience reading Joseph Campbell in that he provides an introduction to a whole slew of topics and turns you on to them with his interesting, enthusiastic take on it all. RAW is like a powerful, potent gateway drug to even better drugs. Just my thoughts at this moment and they are always subject to change. R.I.P. RAW",1237161600,2,1894,4.86687306501548
8114229,3,B000EU1HQM,"I feel like most of the 5 and 4 star ratings that this documentary has received are primarily given for the man himself and not for the quality of this DVD.  It is interesting to watch once, but doesn't have much replay value.  Most of his earlier talks that are included can be found online now, so it's really only the newer interviews that you'd be purchasing.  And even these are just reaffirmations of his lifelong philosophies, along with some reflections on the pain of post-polio syndrome.  Sprinkle in some vaguely trippy transitions and Boards of Canada to top it off.",1208044800,18,578,4.693069306930693
8114230,5,B000EU1HQM,"If you are new to the writings of Robert Anton Wilson, maybe you have just heard of him or maybe you are a science fiction fan who has read only The Illuminatus Trilogy, then don't bother to get this video. If you are intrigued by this writer and want to hear more of his message, then just read more of his books. Any of his books will do; however, I shall recommend Cosmic Trigger, Schroedinger's Cat, and/or Right Where You Are Sitting Now.

If you have read three or more of his books and you would really like to know more about the man, then definitely get this DVD. I met him at a convention about twenty years ago. I got to hear him talk and even to hang out with him a little bit. This man had an incredible presence and a beautiful spirit. Yes, I meant the past tense since he has since passed away. The video does a great job capturing the life and essence, and final days, of this heroic, visionary writer.",1185926400,3,918,4.215909090909091
