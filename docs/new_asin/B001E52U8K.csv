8598696,5,B001E52U8K,"A stellar expose which cuts to the heart of cultural tension within the banter between the oft referenced cultural patriarchy and the vocally representative feminist drive which, in the west, is characteristically overreaching. The balance between bill and clare in their dialogue is fair and erudite.",1467072000,,301,5.565217391304348
8598697,4,B001E52U8K,"This show was previously advertised as a 1975 episode on feminism (since corrected).  Mr. Buckley introduces the show by saying it's unusual for two reasons: there is no set topic (we get to see what was ""in the air"" in that moment in time), and it is not a debate (since they generally agree),

The conversation takes place at the University of Hawaii, with 3 student panelists on a couch, and several more students seated on the floor Romper Room-style in between the stage and the couch. The most prominent subjects of discussion are Spiro Agnew's war with the press and overpopulation.  Perhaps revealing myself as a youngster having caught only the tail end of the Firing Line run on TV, it's fascinating seeing this free-range survey of the political conversation of another age, especially with one of the participants providing the perspective of a previous age (Mrs. Luce contributes a few anecdotes from the 1920s to illustrate the conversation).

I must say that I applaud the Hoover Institution for making select episodes of this amazing show more available, as it is part of the intellectual patrimony of the whole nation.  I'm hoping to see more!",1225670400,7,1160,4.8979591836734695
