8166856,1,B000M7FRSQ,"As an active duty Coast Guard member was looking for something to show my (young) kids about my job.  Despite all the free footage available of real rescues this film has nothing active.  Sure a walk around of a CG Cutter is mildly interesting, but it is NOT a BIG RESCUE.  The title should be a boring introduction to life on a small government vessel.",1363219200,,353,4.4
8166857,5,B000M7FRSQ,Entertaining and educational for children and adults alike.  Collect the whole series.  My 7-year-old son can watch these over and over.  He first saw one of these at age 4 and still enjoys them.,1294876800,2,195,4.676470588235294
