6602788,4,B00MWECMZS,"What excites me about this is that it's an official 20th Century Fox release.  I am hoping that if the studio will finally release one of its ancient properties completely, like ""Daniel Boone"" here, that maybe, just maybe, 20th Century Fox's much-in-demand ""Lancer"" -- and dare I ask ""Judd for the Defense"" -- will follow.",1413590400,2,322,4.8545454545454545

6602790,5,B00MWECMZS,"I watched these episodes growing up.  The set has not been remaster to anamorphic wide screen, but it has all the episodes and the quality is good.  For some reason each disk contains each episode twice, although on the menu you only see it once.  Not sure why they did that, but for just viewing it is really irrelevant.  I have been very happy with the set.  I have not watched them all yet, of course.  This show was my favorite back when I was 6-12 yrs old.  The show still holds a special place in my heart, and now I get to enjoy them all over again.  All I can say is Daniel Boone was THE man back in the day, and now at my house, he is again.",1412121600,2,650,3.9461538461538463

There are no extras in this set, range from 5 episodes a disc at least. They are on discs that hold 8 gigs each so they are DVD-R but the quality can't get better. Now make some pop Corn and get watching! Thanks Amazon and 20th Century Fox.",1411689600,7,488,4.433333333333334
6602792,4,B00MWECMZS,"I pre-ordered Daniel Boone The Complete Series set directly from 20th Century Fox in early September, after I found out that I could have all the episodes for less than some vendors were charging for the 2006 sixth season alone! It arrived this afternoon, a mere day after its scheduled September 24th release date.

On first inspection, this is a nice looking package. Each season, all six of them, is held in a slim black six disk Amaray case. The cases are kept together in a handsome 7 1/2"" X 5 1/2"" X 3 1/2"" cardboard jacket. Each individual season has its own artwork, which is different from the others, and a nice description of the year at hand is condensed into a single paragraph on the back. However, there is no list of the episode titles, either on the season cases, or even the disks themselves. To find out what episodes are on what disk, you have to pull up the menu on your screen...Very inconvenient. How much extra effort would it have been for Fox to include titles on the disk labels?

I have two DVD players set up side by side, and am able to toggle back and forth between the two with ease. Picking disks randomly from various seasons, I sampled several episodes in a relatively short time. The first player would not load the disk, even after several tries. Only after shutting the player down completely, and trying once more, did it finally load. The second player exhibited no problems.

After first having to sit through Fox blowing its own horn, then the usual anti-piracy warning, the menu comes up. Of the six disks I sampled, all had four or five episodes per, with season one typically having five. Watch episodes individually, or choose the ""Play All"" option. Within seconds of the start of season one, episode one, I could tell though, that the images had not been remastered. Those tell-tale flecks that are sprinkled about, usually at the beginning of each act, give it away every time. And even though these are released by the company that produced the series originally, I seriously doubt that few, if any of the episodes in season one were sourced from anything beyond 16mm prints. In fact, on the first disk in seasons three, four, and six, there is a cryptic message informing us that, ""This disk has been manufactured using the best source material available"".

HUH??? This is the kind of disclaimer I might have expected to see from Timeless Media Group...NOT an official studio release.

Overall though, the images are fairly crisp, the colors for season two and up, bold and bright. And I'm happy to report that, of the first five episodes of season two which I've viewed to date, all appeared to have been sourced from digitally remastered 35mm prints...They're THAT good! At no time, did any image suffer from skips or freeze ups. This was a major problem back when studios attempted to save money by embedding the information on BOTH sides of a single disk.

In Amazon's description, the disks are listed as being Region 1. Yet I see nothing on the case, or anywhere else, to confirm that. All I know is that they play fine on my Region 1 players. There is a very small icon on the disk labels, saying that these are of the DVD-R format. Correct me if I'm wrong, but don't all burned disks have a reddish tint to them? Everything I know about DVDs tells me that the disks in this set are the more desirable pressed ones.

This is an episodes only, bare bones set. There is no closed captioning. There are also no cast interviews, bios, network promos, or anything of the sort. If you feel you need the latter, then keep your 2006 sets. However, if you're in the market to BUY a 2006 set, you can take heart in knowing that prices for them have dropped dramatically since the news first broke of Fox's current release. The picture/sound quality is about the same, no matter which set you pick. The only real advantages to owning the new version are: A) The 165 Daniel Boone episodes will take up way less space on your shelves. B) A check of the menus for the first and last disk in every season showed the episodes to be listed in their original broadcast order. C) At the current list price of around $100 for the complete series, that comes to only $.61 per episode.

Owning Daniel Boone has never been cheaper!",1411603200,47,4265,4.558746736292428
6602793,5,B00MWECMZS,"When Fess Parker first came on the scene in the mid fifties as Walt Disney's DAVY CROCKETT, he became a worldwide sensation, the most popular figure of that time, as popular as Elvis Presley or the Beatles which followed, Everyone wanted a Davy Crockett hat and buckskin jacket. But there were only 5 episodes of Davy Crockett, so naturally the demand for more resulted in the Daniel Boone series, cloning one of the most exciting heroic figures of all time. Season 1 is Black/White, but all the other 5 seasons are in color, unfortunately there are no extra features included in this set, so none of the interviews are available as in the original release.

The lineup of guest stars is fantastic and include Kurt Russell, Jim Davis, Jimmy Dean (regular role), Cesar Romero, Fabian, Jay Silverheels, Burl Ives, James Doohan, Torin Tatcher, Michael Rennie, Forrest Tucker, John Davidson, Roger Miller, Kenneth Tobey, Vincent Price, George Gobel, Ricardo Montalban, Shelley Fabares, Jack Elam, Jack Kelly, George Kennedy, Jodie Foster, Victor Buono, Robert Lansing, John Russell, Ron Howard, Jeff York and many others.

The following is a recap of all 6 seasons.

Daniel Boone Season 1
Hollywood legend Fess Parker stars in this entertaining family series as iconic American frontiersman Daniel Boone. Pulled from the pages of history, the first season of this popular show follows the story of Boone, his family and the other residents of Boonesville, Kentucky, as they set out to create new lives for themselves. Despite challenges the settlers face from the British, and from Natives recruited to fight the Kentuckians, there is much hope for a peaceful coexistence in this beautiful, unspoiled territory.

Daniel Boone Season 2
In the second season of this history-inspired American adventure, Daniel Boone's (Fess Parker) friendship with Mingo (Ed Ames) deepens as the two face more dangers. Boone, his wife Rebecca (Patricia Blair) and their family must also stand their ground when the British attack Boonesborough, and when misunderstandings lead to hostilities between Natives and settlers. From helping an escaped slave to pondering the impact of the Louisiana purchase, the Kentucky homesteader continues to be a trusted friend to all who seek a peaceful life in the budding new nation.

Daniel Boone Season 3
The frontier adventure continues in the series' third exciting season as Daniel Boone (Fess Parker) and his family face attempted land grabs, kidnappings and visits from some very impressive dignitaries who wind up in trouble! When President George Washington shows up in Kentucky, Boone and Mingo (Ed Ames) find themselves in the dangerous position of trying to protect him from assassination. A French prince also needs help from the Boone family, and Rebecca (Patricia Blair) engages in a heroic rescue of her own in this exciting family favorite.

Daniel Boone Season 4
Fess Parker returns as wilderness adventurer Daniel Boone in the fourth exciting season of the classic series set on the American frontier. As the years go by in Boonesborough, Kentucky, Daniel and his wife Rebecca (Patricia Blair) become even more dedicated to their homestead - and to maintaining their freedom from British rule. Their son Israel (Darby Hinton) faces new challenges as he approaches young manhood, and Daniel finds himself learning secret military codes and dealing with artillery that will either protect or harm the settlers.

Daniel Boone Season 5
The pioneer spirit is alive and well as Season 5 of the exciting adventure series based on American history thunders back onto the scene! Daniel Boone (Fess Parker) continues to stand strong in the causes of freedom and safety for his fellow settlers. Always ready to help anyone in need, during this season, Boone finds himself serving as everything from a negotiator between Native and settler to a crime sleuth to a matchmaker in this acclaimed show that the whole family will love!

Daniel Boone Season 6
Fess Parker returns as American history icon Daniel Boone in the popular show that has brought quality family entertainment to enthusiastic viewers across the globe. Boone's talents as a rugged frontier man are often matched by his diplomacy and manners. In Season 6, he forms an alliance with John Chapman (aka Johnny Appleseed), who helps maintain peace with the Natives. Boone also steps in to help Benjamin Franklin preserve free speech and autonomy for the new nation in this exciting final season of one of the world's most beloved series.",1409875200,42,4518,5.162568306010929
6602794,4,B00MWECMZS,"One great fun TV show.. But NO CC Closed Caption.. No SDH for the hard of hearing..
Why not?",1408579200,21,92,3.8947368421052633
6602795,4,B00MWECMZS,"First the bad:  We love this series, which I will talk about below, but the set we received was missing the last two discs from season 2.  Season 2 had 30 episodes, the most of all the seasons, yet the last two discs were missing.  Very, Very disappointing since we are missing about 10 episodes.

As far as the series itself:  My wife and I love this series.  I wish they made shows like this today.  Great writing, great acting, portrayal of a loving family, a strong man who loves his wife and children and isn't a wimpy idiot which is so often shown in shows today.  So far we have only seen some of the first season.  The first season of this series was recorded in black and white.  The recordings do not seem to be the best, but might be the best available to record from for the first season.  It is still well worth the money.  A quality show.",1493078400,6,852,4.191358024691358

6602803,4,B00MWECMZS,"I want to give it 5 stars, but I can't. The picture quality just isn't very sharp compared to other shows from the 1960s. To be fair, I compared it against Gilligan's Island and Get Smart, two shows from the same timeframe. Both are much more clear than Daniel Boone, so I know it's not my TV or DVD player. I've played one disc from season 4 and one disc from season 2 and both had the same slightly blurry quality. It's not a deal breaker, just a disappointment. I would still recommend this to Daniel Boone fans, as I doubt we'll get a blu ray release or an updated complete set release, since this series wasn't as popular as some of the others being re-released.",1472688000,2,667,4.301587301587301

6602805,3,B00MWECMZS,"I am disappointed individual episodes are not mentioned at all either on the individual DVD's or on the cheaply made presentation box which for the over $100 price is sad.  If not for enjoying Mingo episodes, I would return this  offering.",1472169600,,239,4.804878048780488
6602806,4,B00MWECMZS,"My 4 star rating is a composite rating -- several parts have different ratings but the over all rating -- based on the television series itself is 4 stars.

I give the series itself a 5 star rating!  I used to watch this as a child.  I don't think I ever saw the pilot before so I may not have watched it all the time.  I have always loved Fess Parker as Daniel Boone and little Darby Hinton as his son Israel but I think that Ed Ames as Mingo was always my favorite character when I was young.  Re-watching now does not destroy those old time memories.  I still like those three and still like Mingo best!

The conversion to DVD is not perfect as has been noted in other reviews.  I did note quite a bit of sparkles, streaks and gray splotches in the first season.  I didn't notice them with the color seasons but maybe they were just not as noticeable.  Each season had 6 disks and either 4 or 5 episodes per disk.  It was a little odd in Season one for the 2 part episode to split across disks but that's what happens when you try to keep the original broadcast episode order.

So far, I have not had time to completely view all episodes.  165 episodes on 36 disks cannot be done fast enough.  However, I have at least ""quick-checked"" (watched at least a short bit of each ""chapter"" of each episode on each disk.  I've had the set only a few days so I've only had time to fully watch one episode (the pilot) but quick check 159 other episodes.  The last 5 episodes, I don't have (I'll explain that next).

I give the condition of the disk a 3 star rating.  There were minor problems with several disks and one disk is missing.  I received 2 copies of Season 2 Disk 4 but no copy of Season 2 Disk 5!

I read a review where one person had trouble with Season 3, Disk 4 twice so I watched that one extra carefully.  That one gave me no problems but Season 3 Disk 1 did give me some problems.  It kept freezing on me in the first episode.  I found the disk to be dirty and scratched.  After cleaning, it worked fine (for a quick-check) when played on the DVD player.  The first test is with a small 7"" portable DVD player (used just for quick-checks).

Season 2, Disk 6 also had a few freezing but it was right around the credits so I didn't pursue it further at this time.  One disk on Season 1, either 2 or 3 (I can't remember now) was freezing badly and when I looked, it was filthy!  A quick cleaning with a micro-cloth and it worked fine, even in the little portable player.

My main problem is the lack of 5 episodes of the series.  The disks themselves seem to be perfectly usable at this stage.

I give 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment 1 star for customer service!  NEVER call them if you have any problems.  All they will do is send you to the seller for a replacement or refund.  They only support their sellers and don't care about the final customers at all!  It even took a ""bump"" to supervisor to find out that even if they wanted to help me, they couldn't.  This DVD set is ""out of print"".  It is totally unavailable except in these 3rd party sellers.  Since they don't have it themselves, they can't sell it to ""approved sellers"" such as Amazon, Walmart, Best Buy... so they don't care and won't help you at all!

If anybody happens to have an ""extra"" copy of Season 2, Disk 5 and is missing Disk 4 (of 6 disks),  I would love to work out a trade!

Over all: 4 Star Rating
5 star -> Series
3 star -> DVDs themselves
1 Star -> Fox Customer Service",1469577600,2,3464,4.156626506024097

6602862,5,B00MWECMZS,"I had almost the same experience watching this as an adult as when I was just a kid.  It is kind of corny and you will wonder how the time frame bounces all over the place from before the Revolutionary War to during the Revolutionary War from week to week.  You will be curious as to what happened to Daniel Boone's daughter as she is there one episode and gone forever the next.  You will not be able to figure out how the Indians  and Redcoats always get killed and the settlers do not.  You might even start thinking why doesn't Daniel Boone take off the silly coonskin cap!  I didn't recall the opening credit and song changing until I watched the series now.  That said, the show is clean, interesting and fairly entertaining.  Well worth the price.  The DVDs are clear and the show is presented in perfect form.  I will bring back memories of a different world.",1427673600,8,867,4.39622641509434

6602864,4,B00MWECMZS,"We loved watching this series when it first aired.  We were delighted when it became available on DVD so we could watch them all again.  We just started watching them.  I think we're on the third disc now.  It's been great except for one place that looks like they missed something and/or got the pieces mixed up.  I believe the episode was ""My Brother's Keeper"".  After that episode ended, it moved on to the opening credits for the next episode, but then showed about 10 minutes of what looked like missing segments from the previous episode (all jumbled up as far as timeline sequence), then it went to opening credits again and started the next episode on the list.  It was like they lost some pieces from the original episode and just threw them in before the next episode started.  Definitely an ooops moment when transfering it to disc.  I sure hope that doesn't happen again before we reach the end of the series.  Sadly, it was way too many years ago that we saw them on tv to remember exactly how that episode went.  Oh well.  Maybe we just got an ooops set of discs.  We definitely recommend watching the series though.  Hopefully yours won't have that mistake in it.",1426377600,2,1178,4.521327014218009

6602872,3,B00MWECMZS,"This was a favorite of mine as a kid but as with most shows created by Fox, it was shoddily treated! No effort was made in restoration (especially in the first season), and no extras! I dare anybody to look at an early season of Gunsmoke or Bonanza or even Rawhide and notice how good they look even in Black and white! I gave it 3 stars for the quality of the show but Daniel Boone was a great family show and deserved better treatment than this. Season 2 is an incredible improvement over season 1 but that's not saying much!",1423526400,5,527,4.227722772277228

6602896,4,B00MWECMZS,"Starring Fess Parker in the title role, Daniel Boone (1964-70) ran for six seasons on NBC, with 165 one hour episodes being produced.  Expressing certain core values and exploring ethical matters, Daniel Boone was generally classified as ""family"" entertainment, but like many frontier and western programs from this era, the series often dealt with some serious issues, including survival, politics, intrigue, and relations with various native American groups.

While I occasionally watched the series, I was never a big fan, until Daniel Boone was featured on a local cable station in 2006, in connection with the series being released on DVD.  I discovered that this well-written program had more to offer than just frontier tales.  A giant of a man who was already familiar for playing Davy Crockett, Fess Parker was also terrific as Daniel Boone.  Parker was a very down to earth person, and that really comes across in his portrayal of the iconic Boone, a dedicated family man, community leader, and resident of Boonesborough, Kentucky.

Played by singer/actor Ed Ames, the character Mingo, was quite groundbreaking.  Mingo was half Cherokee Indian, and half white, and was educated at Oxford in England.  The friendship between Boone and Mingo was something that was quite ""enlightened"" for the mid-60's, a time when civil rights was a major issue.

Unfortunately I missed buying some of the individual seasons on DVD, and the price of those sets rose to ridiculous levels, when they went out of print.  Although many of the season sets have recently dropped in price, the new complete series release, which is squarely targeted at hardcore fans, might be a more way for many to acquire the series,  at least for right now.

Some may be concerned that this release features DVD-R's.  Having purchased&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tarzan/dp/B007K7IC6K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tarzan</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harry-O/dp/B008JEJV2W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harry-O</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Daktari/dp/B00BWQTTD0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Daktari</a>, which are also on DVD-R and look great, I'm hopeful that image quality won't be an issue with the new Boone release.

What happens may not be historically accurate, and things usually ended well, but Daniel Boone was still a little more sophisticated than the average western, and didn't always rely on violence as a solution.  If you're a little weary of the trashiness that so often permeates today's TV, go back in time and follow the adventures of the man from Kentucky with the coonskin cap.",1416096000,16,2710,5.8951406649616365
