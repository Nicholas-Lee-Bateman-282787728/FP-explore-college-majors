7865757,1,6304203934,"Normally I would never pay 38.88 for a dvd. But this was filmed in my hometown, and I got to watch part of the filming. I was so excited to find it for sale, I thought the price was worth it to relive some memories. Wrong. It is the worst quality dvd I have ever seen. It's so fuzzy I can hardly make out what the peoples faces look like. It looks like a copy of a copy. This sucks. How can I get my money back?",1487462400,,411,3.735632183908046

7865762,5,6304203934,"Its too bad u only could give it 5 stars(grr).  Well first about what this movie is about: its about two brothers who live in a farm.  The bank decides to buy the farm.  RGs caracther is the big brother, and finds out that if the bank are going to buy the house, then he would rather burn the whole farm down, which both him and his brother(Played by the equally talented actor Kevin Anderson) decides together that its good to do.  It al have horrible consequenses as the police are trying to get them.  I cant reveall any more for those of u who haven't seen it.
Now to my opinions about this movie(the fun part of a review):This movie means so much to me, that if I doesnt get at least tears in my eyes I got real bad feeling(I feel then I own Mr. Gere my al time favorite american movie actor an HUGE appology, in fact he is the only american movie actor I truly like)
If u ever have felt discrimination on your body, then this movie is for u(even if u havent, u will learn alot about how it is to be told by anyone that u are less worh then they are for some stupied reason).  RG played this movie in the beginning of his ""Fight for the Freedom in Tibet"" perhaps thats why he plays with so much emotion, in fact even more then in other classics like ""An officer and a gentleman"" and ""Mr. Jones""
Its also a movie for those who DO discriminate others, in fact I think it was made for those, more then anyone else.  I hope this movie can make u think about what u do to others, and what it can leads to, how it can destroy a human beings feelings.
Also the relationships between the two brothers are just amaizing, Richard and Kevin has an incredibly chemistry as brothers.  I also like alot the animal scenes.  Ive always loved animals, so the fact that this movie also has messages about them just means even more to me.
Kevin Anderson is just great as a little brother, u see that he respects R Geres caracther, but on the other hand he always tries to do things in his own way.
It has some funny moments too of course, its not only sad! (its very real, so real that its almost scary to watch)
But the best thing about the movie has to be the end!
Thank u Richard Gere(and to the director for making this movie) for playing in this incredibly deep and meaningfull movie.
Also u don't have to be the biggest Gere or even not the biggest Kevin fan to see this movie.  This movie will make u realize why these 2 actors are so populare with us fans, it was one of the movies that made me a die hard RG fan along with ""Breathless""""Amerian Gigolo"" and of course the incredibly good movie ""An officer and a gentleman""
Also its the most underrated movie ever(I mean 1 review exepth this? come on people review this masterpiece and let the world know what good movies are supposed to be about).  Also this isn't for action fans to say it like that.(its a drama movie)
P.S if u wants to see a new good movie with RG then I recommend u to see ""Chicago"" I haven't seen it, but my guess is that it will more like this 80s stuff, and not the kind of thing RG did in the late 90s(and in the beginning of this decade)",1043798400,5,3106,4.134328358208955
7865763,4,6304203934,This is a great movie all the way - great story line and great performances. It comes very well recommended to all.,962150400,4,115,4.2727272727272725
