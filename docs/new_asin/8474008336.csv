Enjoyable ... but be warned, this product is NOT a DVD ...  our only VCR player is in the basement gym we have in our home ... great encouraging music for the treadmill ... but it is VCR and NOT DVD!!!!  Still, highly enjoyable!!!",1445472000,,393,4.402777777777778

7901115,4,8474008336,"""Marching to Zion"" is filmed and recorded at the Gaither Studio along with ""Rivers of Joy."" This video reminds me of an old time ""Hymn Sing"" featuring familiar and favorite gospel hymns.

I especially enjoyed: Larry Ford singing ""It is Well with My Soul,"" Lulu Roman and ""Failure Isn't Final,"" and Janet Pascal's touching ""Another Soldier Coming Home."" The Hopper Family's number ""I'll Be Like Him"" was very effective and was well received by the other participants. Another great number was ""I've Been to Calvary"" featuring Jeanne Johnson. I always enjoy Anthony Burger at the piano.

Terry McMillan shared a brief testimony and gave a unique rendition of ""This Train is Bound for Glory. Several musical groups were featured including: The Hoppers, The Happy Goodmans, The Daryl Williams Trio, and The Hayes Family. The Galileans added a Spanish flavor to the program with an arrangement of ""There's a Song Within My Heart."" Various ensembles made up of Homecoming Friends were featured in several additional numbers.

Another wonderful program of gospel music, worship, and inspiration.",1304640000,,1088,5.241379310344827
