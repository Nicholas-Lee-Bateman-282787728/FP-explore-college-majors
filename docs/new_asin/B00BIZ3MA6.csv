8569188,4,B00BIZ3MA6,"I have to admit to collecting Disney videos from their animated classic, Disney Parks and select live action films. Most of the Disney Parks videos are more like informercials, but this collection including four individual releases for each park is pretty good as an overview of the park illustrated on the cover. This one The Magic Kingdom runs approx. 30 minutes give or take and has several options to make the experience more enjoyable and gives some replay value.

You can watch the video, or add the Trivia Track which adds fun facts in text at the bottom go the screen. Another option is Disney Details where you can click on the Mickey icon to bring up stills and short video footage of different events and old footage from WDW. There is also so short video footage of first person ride throughs on some of the more popular rides.

The menu is a bit tedious with no play all feature, but it isn't too irritating to navigate. You can probably spend an hour an a half viewing all that is here and it is certainly better than the informercial style DVD's out there. The video quality could be better and is much improved on the newer informercial DVD's , but this collection is entertaining for what it is and if you can find them at a reasonable price it's worth it for Disney collectors. One more note this was released in a 5 disc box set under the title When Dreams Come True. adding the Disney Cruise Line video which has slightly better quality, a few small add on extras and a slightly better menu.",1405728000,,1511,4.490909090909091
