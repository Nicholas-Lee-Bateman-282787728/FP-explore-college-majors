8070227,4,B0009XT8JW,"I've been enjoying ""discovering"" the old black-and-white mysteries from the 30's and 40's.  The ""Bulldog Drummond"" film series was definitely before my time, but these are so much fun to watch.  This particular movie involves world domination by, of course, evil bad guys and a ""Mata-Hari"" type character thrown in - why not? Just be advised the transfer is not always crisp, particularly with the sound, but I believe it's as best as can be and still more than watchable.  Great for a rainy afternoon!",1392508800,2,502,4.882352941176471
8070228,3,B0009XT8JW,This film strays from the formula of the other Bulldog Drummond films with no gain.  They used the Bulldog Drummond brand but then had a completely different tone of the film.  It is like Nick and Nora of the Thin Man series all of a sudden became Nick and Martha.  Quality is adequate.  Story is confused and not developed.  I miss the butler  E. E. Clive (?)  The big advantage of the film is that it shows the values and thinking of the period.  This is pre World War II but the film is preparing the audience for the war to come.  Lots left unexplained in the film.,1364601600,2,569,4.194444444444445

8070230,4,B0009XT8JW,"Pretty good picture quality, though at times a little light.  The Howard and Miland movies were better.  This leading man was a  little bland, but the story was good.",1278892800,4,166,4.655172413793103
8070231,4,B0009XT8JW,We have all the Bulldog Drummond movies that are available.  This recent one does not have the same actors as the other movies.  I liked the movie but I prefer the other actors in the other ones.  This as the other Bulldog Drummond's was very good.,1207785600,9,248,4.3478260869565215
