2077262,5,B0002CX1LG,"Wonderful news to know that the Munsters episodes are gonna be
released on DVD. I have seen some episodes and even have
recorded some on VHS but I haven't seen all. I literally fall
from my bed laughing each time I see an episode. What a great
chemistry the actors made: Fred Gwyne (Herman) and Al Lewis
(granpa) plus the talents of Yvonne De Carlo, Pat Priest and
Butch Patrick. I recall an episode where Herman asks his boss
for a raise and he gets fired and he didn't want Lily to know
he was without a job, then he seretely goes out seeking for a
new job and ends up with various jobs where he surely made a mess
and gave us a chain of funny situations.",1089763200,7,657,4.140625
2077263,5,B0002CX1LG,"i have been a Munsters' fan for as long as i can remember. when i received news about the long-awaited DVD release of the 1st season, you can imagine my excitement. there is only 1 thing that is bothering me about the 1st season release. i wonder if Universal is going to correct the spelling error on the cover of the box - ""THE COMPLETTE FIRST SEASON"". nevertheless, i can overlook something as small as that, as long as i have my Munsters' on DVD that's all that matters!!!!",1086480000,6,477,4.370786516853933
2077264,5,B0002CX1LG,"Hello.  I'm giving the DVD collection a rating of 5 stars even before it is available; I have seen all of the rerun episodes on cable and that show was and is  still something.  I vividly remember watching THE MUNSTERS when I was about 10 yrs old, sitting comfortably on the couch cuddled up on my grand-mother who initiated me to THE MUNSTERS.  I just can't wait to get my hands on that first season collection!  That was television!",1086480000,2,434,4.443037974683544
2077265,5,B0002CX1LG,"I grew up on both the Munsters and the Addams Family, so I've always had much love for both shows. But when it came down to it, the Munsters was always my top pick. Maybe it was the collection of ""monsters"" within the family, or Marilyn, or the  family's crazy hot rods the Munster Koach & the Dragula from legendary customizer George Barris, or just the comfort zone of the corny one-liners and family-oriented atmosphere. In any case, The Munsters is definitely classic in every sense and now it's here on DVD!

The set's package design is somewhat inspired. The outer box opens ""coffin-style"" to reveal the disc-holding ""digipack"" inside, as the flipped-open box top has the table of contents on it with only the episodes plus the unaired pilot listed. The episodes are spread across 3 double-sided discs. Here's a list of the season 1 episodes:

2077321,5,B0002CX1LG,"I had forgotten how brilliant the Munsters were. Loved them as a kid in reruns, but now as an adult I can appreciate it way more. Interesting to watch how Herman evolved over the course of maybe the first 15 episodes or so. Fantastic acting, characters, writing etc. It's basically Leave it to Beaver (family sitcom), but with monsters, and where everything they love is backwards (like when Lilly vacuums, she blows dirt out into the room). And they packed 70 episodes into 2 seasons - now that's a work schedule........",1492819200,,521,4.736263736263736

All Star cast...Fred Gwynn, Al Lewis, and Yvonne Decarlo accompanied by Beverly Owen, Pat Priest, and Butch Patrick made the Munsters unforgettable...and the Icing on the Cake was John Carradine as Mr. Gateman.

2077425,5,B0002CX1LG,"I wish kids of these days would get a chance to watch something like this.  The Munsters were a hoot.  Fred Gwynne was a phenomenal actor with big credits to his name.  Who could forget him playing the judge in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/My-Cousin-Vinny/dp/B000SFOW8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">My Cousin Vinny</a>?  Yvonne De Carlo, Lily Munster, had spent years on both the small and big screen beginning in 1941.  Movies such as Cecil B. DeMille's masterpiece&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ten-Commandments/dp/B00AEBBACM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ten Commandments</a>&nbsp;(1956) have her name attached.  Al Lewis, Grandpa, was both a comedian and psychologist with a Ph D., a Broadway stage actor and could also be a mobster in movies.  Such was the cast of The Munsters.

Gwynne once remarked that wearing the costume and make up of Herman was terribly painful and lead to chronic pain afterwards.  What he never said was he would have turned away from the role had he known.  Fred Gwynne was a fantastic choice for the role.

The Munsters were the odd family on the road.  Living at 1313 Mockingbird Lane, Herman (Frankenstein's Monster), Lily (Bride of Frankenstein), Grandpa (Vampire), Eddie, played by Butch Patrick (Wolfman) and ""oddball"" 'Cousin Marilyn' who was completely normal, made up the family.  The jokes came about Herman's size, Grandpa's inventions and Eddie's happenings at school.  Every now and then someone coming to date Marilyn would meet the family and freak out.

This was good clean fun and we sure loved it.",1466899200,,1641,5.864978902953586

The wife is not Lily, it's some lady named Phoebe and the son is some weird kid, and not the original actor. It's awful. Not sure what happened because the DVD cover portrays the cast, but it's not the same on the disk that I put in.

2077605,5,B0002CX1LG,"I think that most people are buying this classic already knowing all about it and they love it.  If not, there are many reviews on the show itself.  The Munsters season 1 contains all 38 episodes, including the 13-minute un-aired pilot episode.  The un-aired pilot episode is in COLOR, and features different actors in the role of Lily and Eddie Munster.  I feel that the pilot episode is merely an interesting piece of video, knowing that this was the first Munsters act to be filmed.  It is really not enjoyable since it is not a complete episode and does not have Yvonne De' Carlo and Butch Patrick.  (The main actors of Lily and Eddie).  The episode, 'Family Portrait', is also in COLOR, but is still available to watch in black and white.  The rest of the episodes are in original black and white format.  The video quality is not outstanding, but not bad either.  Typical DVD transfer.  As far as I can tell, none of the episodes appear to be edited or cut in any way.  Unlike SOME of the other classic TV shows that were released on DVD.  The case itself is a standard DVD case style, (although just slightly thicker than a DVD case, because of 6 discs obviously.)  Overall, this is a fine set to own, and I would recommend it to any Munsters fan.",1389398400,4,1254,4.442982456140351

DVDs: They are double sided so the box set isn't too big, the episodes are shown in black & white as they originally aired. They may not be HD but they are still good quality.

So when I saw the Munsters season one on sale I just had to get it. I remember when I was a kid back in the day when my mom would wake me up for school the Munsters would always be on.

2077641,5,B0002CX1LG,"I have always been a fan of Universal Monster films, so when Universal decided to make a TV show starring monsters, I knew I was in. The show only survived a two year run from 1964 - 1966, but made a legion of fans with its indelible and unforgettable characters. Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis especially deserve a lot of the credit with their broad interpretations of The Frankenstein Monster and Dracula.

The first season shows the growth of the series going from a dark parody of 'Leave it to Beaver' to a kooky slap stick comedy. There is also a change in one of the family members, niece Marilyn Munster was originally played by beautiful Beverly Owen and left the show after 13 episodes to get married. As I recall she had a problem getting out of the show, but Fred Gwynne stepped in to help her out. I prefer Beverly to her replacement Pat Priest, but she fills the role wonderfully. She is in the majority of the episodes, so most people remember her more and consider her the true Marilyn. There are also make up changes and the tone of the show is different after Beverly left.

I enjoy the first season a little more than the second only because we get to meet some relatives like Lyle who is Lily's brother A.K.A. The Wolf Man and Uncle Gilbert who is The Creature From The Black Lagoon. This is a real treat because Universal produced this show they were able to use the real masks from 'The Creature From The Black Lagoon' and 'The Return of the Vampire'. We also get to see the introduction of ""Woof Woof"" in various forms and those two totally awesome cars 'The Munsters Koach' and 'The Drag-ula'! Two of George Barris's greatest creations.

This first season set includes all 38 season one episodes and an unaired color pilot with different actors in the roles of Lily and Eddie. It's very interesting to see as we get to see The Munsters in color and with the different opening. It is the only bonus feature on this set and that is one of the few flaws I think are worth mentioning.  Two of the episodes have a music cue edit, one of them is the cue in 'The Sleeping Cutie' when Marilyn is kissed by the prince the song 'Someday My Prince Will Come' is changed and the other in Far Out Munster when Eddie played a cut of the Standells on the phonograph. They are not bad enough to ruin this otherwise great set, but it is a thorn in the side of fans that will notice. Fortunately The Standells songs that are performed in the house are intact! Another thorn is that the episodes are on double sided discs, but I have never had a problem with that practice as long as it's done with care and the discs work. I really don't see how there is any more danger of damage than single sided disc as both sides have the protective coating. I mean how many times are you going to play these things. I've just watched this season and I'm sure it will be a year or so before I get around to seeing them again.

On the good side, the episodes look very good with minimal dirt etc. The sound is also good for the most part with one or two episodes suffering from lower volume, but it's not all that bad. I'm also glad they have some chapter breaks so you can skip the opening when watching multiple episodes. It would have been nice to have Beverly Owens picture on the menu screen of the first disc instead of Pat Priest, but it's not a big deal. All and all a great set with some minor annoyances. If you don't own this set and love The Munsters you may want to buy the complete collection which offers single sided discs and also includes both Munster movies and a colorized episode. Unfortunately they did not correct any of the other small problems on the new release. I've never really liked the films so I will probably stick with my season sets.",1269475200,3,3754,4.334281650071124

2077643,5,B0002CX1LG,"Next to ""Bewitched"" the best supernatural sitcom from the 1960's has to be ""The Munsters"". A series about a family of monsters with hearts of gold debut on CBS on September 24, 1964 and immediately became an instant hit. ""The Munsters"" was designed to show the comedic side to a bunch of people who were different living in every day society. It was ""The Munsters"" interactions with ""normal"" people that set the course for the series as week after week the audience would laugh at how Herman and the rest of his clan tried to fit in with the average American. Screen legend Yvonne DeCarlo also starred as Herman's wife Lily. After appearing in only a few episodes as the niece of Herman and Lily, Beverley Owen asked to be left out of her contract because she missed her fiance on the east coast. She was replaced by Pat Priest. In this marvelous boxset all 38 episodes from season 1 are included along with the unaired color 15 minute pilot never seen before. The set itself opens like a coffin and 3 dual layered discs are included. Besides the unaired pilot no other bonus features are included. In ""The Munsters"" first year on the air it finished at #18 ahead of ""Gilligan's Island"" and ""Peyton Place"".

In Season One, the show was still finding its way, but quickly became an American icon. Fred Gwynne, as Frankenstein's monster, still acted lifeless, as did Boris Karloff in the original 1931(?) movie; deadpan, towering, intimidating, but very kind-hearted and upstanding. The extreme silliness would come later. Yvonne DeCarlo, as Lily, stands out as one of the most striking presences in TV history, the image of her standing at the bottom of the stairs when the opening credits roll, is absolutely enthralling. But for some reason, the prominent white streaks in her hair gradually went away, as did what sounded like a New England accent. Al Lewis, as Grampa, aka Dracula had his nose change in size and shape, but is everyone's favorite curmudgeon. It's too bad Beverly Owen didn't want to stay in California, she was so good in the Marilyn character, but Pat Priest filled her shoes nicely. Butch Patrick was about all that didn't change by the time the show found its stride. He was just Eddie.

The humor is often subtle, and very sophisticated, and the show made a point about Middle-Class White America. The Neighbors didn't want ""those people"" in their neighborhood, even though ""those people"" were of a better calibre than the people who surrounded them. I would have loved to have been their neighbors. But I guess I am weird that way.

It is so enjoyable to watch and I particularly enjoyed seeing the (color) Pilot Episode (because I had never seen it). I was so glad Joan Marshall and Happy Derman were re-cast - they weren't quite right for the roles.

The quality of the DVDs is excellent (though, of course, I would have preferred single-sided disks) and I love the packaging (unique).

Be careful where you store the box, because it is quite soft and shiny, there is the tendency there for the box to to pit/scratch - you don't want to store it next to your knives!!!!.

Priceless is the inclusion of the unseen pilot with a different Lilly and a hairier Eddie where they worry about the ""ugliness"" of Marilyn and her inability to get a stable romantic relationship with any man.

The package is MUCH MUCH better than the one for season 2 (why didn't they just kept up with the same format?).

The discs are great, they include some rare footage and subtitles. The image is very polished as well as the audio.

Nice menus with episode synopsis. A nice DVD package. BUT two defective DV-18 double-sided dual-layered discs on my set. Two episodes on different discs (Rock-a-Bye Munster and Come Back Little Googie) either pixelate for 10 seconds or pixelate then stop the player. It's terrible holding your breath wondering if/when the disc will freeze or completely stop playing. This happens too often on Universal DV-18 DVD's. Universal's Quality Control is horrible. The bonding process, poor manufacturing or cheap materials or something else is at fault, not to mention the discs scratch eaiser and are more difficult to handle than DV-9 single sided discs. Universal DV-18's seem to have a failure rate that's unneccssarily high in this day and age. I've had it also happen on Dune Extended Edition. I exchange it twice at Walmart. Both copies had pixelation problems in different scenes. Another copy bought at Best Buy was fine. Buck Rogers Epic Series Disc One had a large scratch on it right out of a new sealed box. Many people I know had pixelation problems on Miami Vice Season One. Thankfuly I did not. Universal's continued choice of using DV-18 discs is a bad one. FWIW I emailed Universal at universalstudios.com. They said they will replace the defective discs. The DVD's will supposedly be tested prior to shipping. They will send a pre-paid envelope in which to return the discs. They want just the discs not the entire set and packaging so that's fine with me if the replacements play fine. But this shouldn't even be a continuing issue with any discs. 5 stars for the Munsters Show and having it available on DVD.

2077681,5,B0002CX1LG,"The Munsters are an ageless classic. Though they only lasted 2 seasons on CBS, The Munsters are still around 41 years later to please their fans!

This complete first season set, features all 38 episodes from The Munsters first season on CBS. Also featured is the color pilot episode, ""My Fair Munster"", which features different people playing the characters of Lily and Eddie.

Some VHS tapes have been released in the past featuring this color pilot, but only the first 5 minutes of it. Well, rest assured, this color pilot episode is fully intact. It is the original first pilot of The Munsters, in all it's colorful glory.

Here's one thing you should look for, as you watch this set, take a look at the make-up change from the first 13 episodes. The Munsters are not as dark, and the sandy look in their faces, disappears. Not to return again, until the very beginning of the second season, because episodes from the early first season re-ran during the summer of 1965, so they had to had some extra darkness to the Munster's faces, until about 10 weeks into the second season.

Another thing to watch for in this Season 1 set, is that the first 13 episodes, were almost filmed in the dark. There is almost no light or contrast in the very early episodes like ""Autumn Croakus,"" ""Munster Masquerade,"" ""My Fair Munster,"" and ""A Walk on the Mild Side."" It is not a DVD problem, it's just how the original early episodes were filmed, as to establish a light tone, and not have children scared away.

Also, take a look at Al lewis' widows-peak. It changes from episode to episode, and eventually is no longer drawn in with a pencil. They finally get him a widows-peak wig to wear in ""Munsters on the Move.""

The last three issues I would like to address, is space of episodes on the discs, B&W film turning sepia, and the picture quality of ""Autumn Croakus,"" and ""Lily Munster~ Girl Model.""

There are 39 half-hour items on this set. If you have 3 double-sided discs, why not use the space appropriately? The episodes should have been spaced in this manner, seven episodes on Disc 1 A, Disc 1 B, and Disc 2 A, then 6 episodes on Disc 2 B, Disc 3 A, and Disc 3 B.

There is also a visible problem with some episodes turning sepia. Not all the episodes have their original rich B&W format. Some episodes have a yellow-brown tint that is visible by turning up the color on your television set. The only episodes with real B&W, are ""Low Cal Munster,""  and ""Love comes to Mockingbird Heights.""

""Autumn Croakus,"" and ""Lily Munster~ Girl Model,"" both seem to have some sort of video problems. In ""Autumn Croakus,""  their is a huge lightning-bolt shaped film crack for one frame. It is big, and makes the whole picture jump. ""Lily Munster~ Girl Midel,""  has a unique video problem. There are about five small black dots that stay in the middle of the screen for about the first 7 minutes. Then, they finally fade away and the picture gets better.

This show has been around since I was a little kid.(40 some Years). I remember coming home from school every day. I couldn't wait for the Munsters to come on,(on our old B&W tv). It was a great show then & It's a great show now! I recently bought the first season & boy does it bring back a lot of memories. The DVD's are great. I haven't had any of the problems that other reviewers have had. If you buy it from Amazon , you will most likely get a good set. So far, all of the box sets I've gotten from them have been great! I've read all of the reviews & a lot of them made me wince. But alas, I forged on & I'm glad I did. This is a great show for the kids of today. Instead of all that junk they seem to be watching these days, It's nice to see some old shows still out there. So, Buy this great dvd box set today before it's gone for good.

The 3 disc set will contain 32 episodes (about 825 mins). The set is to be packaged in a Herman Munster head with an approximate retail cost of $49.98.

And for the best part- Extras!! They'll include:

- America's First Family of Fright

- Fred Gwynne: More Than a Munster

- Yvonne De Carlo: Gilded Lady

- Al Lewis: Forever Grandpa

If the extras sound familiar to you it is because they were going to be released by Image Entertainment last year.

Hopefully all the transfers will be as crisp and clean as the Season 1 release and any playing glitches (which some have experienced with Season 1) will be all ironed out.

2077689,4,B0002CX1LG,"Having been a fan of the Munsters (which I still enjoy over The Addams Family) I was excited to get this DVD set.  I can finally watch the uncut versions of these episodes.  In syndication, most of these episodes were cut - some by several minutes -  over the years.  Rewatching the DVDs I can finally see some of the scenes that were awkwardly edited to accomodate commercials.

These black & white episodes are much crisper and clearer than any old TV broadcast and it really adds to the enjoyment of the series.  Although, some of the magic is lost when you can see how cheezy the sets and props were.

I would have liked more extras.  Some period interviews with the main players, Yvonne DeCarlo, Pat Priest, Fred Gwinne, etc. would have been nice. The 15 minute color ""pilot"" supposedly was used to sell the series to CBS execs.  While it is interesting, it falls remarkably flat.

The pilot doesn't feature all of the core cast - Eddie and Lily are played by different actors, (Lily isn't even the mother's name at this point - it's something like Naomi) and they are poor substitutes for Butch Patrick and Yvonne DeCarlo. Although this is just a ""pilot"" episode, Eddie's character at this point is nothing more than a snarling, whining rat/bat boy with little dialog. Additionally, the sets and the makeup appear very different from what we're used to seeing in the series.  The ghastly look of color makes the ""pilot"" look like a bad sitcom from the late 70's rather than the early 60's.  How the series ever got sold to the CBS executives with the review of this pilot is unimaginable.

Overall this DVD set is a refreshing look back at a fun and lighthearted sitcom from a simpler time.",1122595200,4,1696,4.576158940397351

2077694,5,B0002CX1LG,"I bought this quite a while ago and still am not through the whole set. About halfway. There is A LOT here!! But I think I have successfully watched all the episodes that people say ""freeze"" up etc, and can say my set seems fine. But what continues to shock me is how well written the show is. I've always had a sort of bizzare sense of humor (ever heard of Phil Hendrie?) and I'm surprised how well the Munsters have held up... this show is how old, 40 years? You'd never know it.

So much of the humor is word play and that's right up my alley. I suppose it could be viewed as bad puns but I think of it as witty penmenship. Much of the humor was also successfully used in the Addams Family in which ""good"" is ""bad"" ""dark"" is ""light"", etc, and while it may seem juvenile, the reason this humor works is how convincingly the cast delivers their lines. You get the sense that they BELIEVE what they are saying and that is the key. For instance, today I watching an episode in which Marilynn had a temperature of 98.6! To you and I that would seem about right but to Lilly and Herman she was burning up! It's all in their reactions to situations that MAKES the situations.

I bought this so long ago, I don't remember what I paid but looking at the price now and having bought several sets of various shows since then I can say it is pretty much higher than the average, but the packaging is so beautiful, the transfer is so clear, the menu system is so perfect, and the humor is obviously timeless that you not only owe Universal your dollars, you owe it to yourself to own this. Sure, there are a couple of clunkers along the way and some of the guest stars seem more like 50's throwbacks, but all in all this is as classic as TV will ever get. Now where are the Addams Family?",1114041600,4,1778,4.180758017492711

2077697,4,B0002CX1LG,"Welcome to 1964. And one of the ""in"" things that year for kids was monsters. All sorts and shapes could be seen on the airwaves in reruns but especially those of the old Hollywood variety like Dracula,the Mummy and of course Frankenstein. Monster magazines like ""Famous Monsters"" was in its' heyday and Aurora the model makers issued its' officiially licensed versions of many of them.
Thrown into this mix was TVs' takes on the fad and one of the best was The Munsters.
It had a wonderful cast,was wonderfully scripted and very well acted throughout its' too short run. Family shows were prevelant on TV at this time like Father Knows Best,The Danny Thomas Show,The Dick Van Dyke Show and The Donna Reed Show. The latter of which,if memory serves correctly,was the inspiration for the Munsters opening sequence.
Having viewed the entire three disc first season set I am amazed at how well the humour of the series still stands up today. In fact it's humour and other basic qualities are something that remind me,to my great chagrin,of something that is completely devoid in TV today. Good FAMILY entertainment. Something everyone could watch and enjoy.
Another aspect of The Munsters I must mention is that after viewing this show again for the first time in about 40 years(has it been that long??)I am amazed at how well Fred Gwynne did at his part. With what surely must have been a long and gruelling day from the application of his make up to his performance in front of the hot studio lights,etc he still managed to bring off a wonderful performance and made it look so effortless. A real trouper and a testament to his acting skills.
The entire cast in fact seemed to bond together quite well and quickly as this show seemed to hit the ground running from the start.
I urge all parents out there that are looking for wholesome and family oriented shows that the ENTIRE family can sit and watch together to get this set and the next season that will accompany it in time. And start an NEW old tradition.",1105228800,7,2009,4.661971830985915

As I read some of the reviews posted here, I was concerned whether these DVDs will play properly and was delighted that the set I purchased through amazon.com played perfectly.

Having seen these episodes for the first time now (with my friend) I found the series both entertaining and heartwarming and was happy that the episodes are also geared toward instilling ethics and moral values.  Whatever challenges the heroes of these episodes may be facing, they always act with integrity, and even though the main character - Herman Munster looks like Frankenstein and is rather clumsy, his good nature makes him a very lovable character.  He is a wonderful example of what makes a human being worthy of love and respect, regardless of the physical appearance and whatever quirks one might have.",1104969600,68,938,4.880503144654088

2077701,5,B0002CX1LG,"Beyond the laughs that come with seeing Frankenstein wear a suit of armor to a costume party or record a pop hit and get an inflated ego as a result, The Munsters is a treatise on prejudice; one of the first television shows to do so and therefore an important landmark in American popular culture history.

The Munsters are intended to represent an African-American family. They are misunderstood and feared. Few people visit them, and when visitors realize what The Munsters are, they run away in fear. Eddie has to capture friends to play with because he is scorned, though this doesn't seem to bother him; chalk it up to the innocence of childhood. Marilyn does quite well socially until her beaus meet her family and are frightened and threatened by them becasue of what they are.

There is even racial tension within the household. Grandpa often insults Herman, citing Herman's monster heritage to do so. He is obviously threatened by Herman marrying his vampire daughter and chipping away at his identity-much the way a white man at the time (and, unfortunately, in many cases still to this day) would feel if a black man married his daughter.

I'm guessing that Lily is pure vampire and that Herman has some wearwolf in his family heritage, hence Eddie's vampire-wearwolf appearance. I suppose it is possible that Lily has some wearwolf on her mother's side of the family.

A television show that makes you laugh and think at the same time is rare. For that reason, The Munsters is something to treasure.",1098835200,12,1512,4.803846153846154
2077702,4,B0002CX1LG,"As others have noted, check the ""Rock-A-Bye Munster"" episode to see if it plays for you. I finally got a good copy after three returns.

Other notes: try cleaning the dvd player and dvd disk. There are dvd cleaning products that you can buy that clean the internal works of the dvd player that may get clogged with dust over time. Fingerprints on the actual dvd disk can also cause problems with playback. Again, dvd/cd disk solvents can be purchased to effectively clean the disk.

I gave this boxed set only four stars because of the hassle of returning it to the store for all the exchanges, but it's great to see all the old episodes that many of us grew up with some years ago.

2077705,5,B0002CX1LG,"The video transfer on these DVDs is exceptionally good.  The black and white images are especially rich and deep.

I really like on-screen captioning on DVDs.  I am glad it is included on these dics.  All lot of DVDs have neither on-screen captioning or closed captioning, even on some major label releases.  I never noticed even one minor typo on these captions.  I also like how each caption is nicely positioned underneath whoever is doing the speaking.

It is hard to image how some network prime time TV series prior to the late 1960s, especially the half-hour shows, would have as many as 38 new episodes a year, meaning that a lot of episodes were never repeated until the series went into syndication.  Such is the case with ""The Munsters"".  Indeed, there are 38 episodes here on this DVD set which only includes the series' first year.  The ""Twilight Zone"" is another such series that had over 30 episodes per year.

1965 was the year when practically overnight, network TV made the transition to from black and white to color, especially during the TV Fall season premieres.  Fortunately, ""The Munsters"" was not forced to join in this really big change along with all the other returning TV series that year.

Another DVD label, Image Entertainment, had planned to release on the same date as this DVD set, a two-DVD set containing documentaries and bonus features about ""The Munsters"".  That DVD has been either scrapped or postponed.  I hope the material planned for that DVD release gets used somewhere, sometime, as I was really looking forward to seeing it.

I am sure I will also enjoy the DVD release of the series' second, final year and, with luck, maybe a new, authorized DVD release of the motion picture ""Munster Go Home"".",1096761600,5,1744,4.763333333333334
2077706,4,B0002CX1LG,"The Munsters is hands down simple minded brilliant camp comedy. The show was cast perfectly and Fred Gwynne, in my opinion, is one of the funniest people to ever grace American television.

There are reviewers using words like ""hammy""..don't you get it??...this show was PARODY....like an ""AIRPLANE"" movie, it was all done tongue in cheek, minus the vulgarity.  This is NOT Masterpiece Theatre, and never pretended to be.

Not everyone appreciates this type of humor, and that's okay.. ...but be fair... evaluate something on its own merits. ""The Munsters"" was pure candy for the brain...it made millions laugh...people still love it and legions of new fans are showing up to buy this classic on DVD.

As for the ""Munsters"" and ""Addams Family comparison, there is none. The  shows had different approaches..like comparing apples and oranges . I always preferred ""The Munsters"" because I am a fan of slapstick, vaudeville, and camp...I am a stooge fan, and a ""Car 54, Where Are You"" fan...for me the ""Addams Family"" never felt carefree and fun like Herman and his brood.

I gave this set 4 stars instead of 5 only because I too had playback problems, and had to return to the store for an exchange. Universal must have been half assing it on quality when they produced these discs....but getting the second box set home, and finding it played just fine snapped me out of my bad mood quickly..Thanks Herman, Grandpa, Lilly, Eddie, and Marylin...now bring on season two or I'll change myself into a bat!",1095379200,13,1500,4.8858267716535435

2077713,4,B0002CX1LG,"The resident monsters of 1313 Mockingbird Lane come to DVD in this 3 disc deluxe set that includes all 38 original broadcast black & white episodes of the first season ""The Munsters"". Herman (Fred Gwynne) looks like Frankenstein's Monster while his wife Lily looks like Dracula's daughter. Her father? Well, Grandpa is, for all intents and purposes, Dracula. Herman and Lily's son Eddie looks like he's a budding werewolf. The only normal looking member of the clan Marilyn is blond and beautiful but thinks she's repulsive because of  how her relatives look. The running joke of this harmless and charming series was how normal The Munsters were on the inside. Really an inversion of ""The Addams Family"" (which has yet to come to DVD), the family here looked like monsters but were average folks on the inside whereas the Addams family appears normal on the outside but is far, far from it. ""The Munsters"" only lasted about two seasons (70 episodes) but was spun off into two movies, a new TV series and a couple of TV movies.

Presented in glorious, original black & white and at their original running times, ""The Munsters"" looks pretty good given the age of the negatives. After the show was cancelled it gained a second life in syndication where, over the years, the series was often edited for additional commercial breaks. The limited mono soundtrack comes across a bit black and without much depth but that's to be expected given the crude recording techniques of 1964.

 No notable extras except for the original unaired 15 minute pilot episode. What's interesting is that  Yvonne De Carlo and Butch Patrick were not in the original pilot episode at all. The pilot was shot simply to sell the series to network television. The fifteen minute pilot script was recycled for another episode.  There aren't any other extras. It's unlikely that the gag reels, outtakes or other sequences probably exist given the age of the series. However, Pat Priest, De Carlo, Lewis and Patrick would all probably be available for interviews, commentary tracks if Universal asked. My guess is that the series probably has too little sales potential for them to pursue these types of more expensive extras. Here's hoping that season two might have these types of extras. There aren't any commentary tracks which is pretty sad. Evidently Universal doesn't believe in providing much in the way of extras (or stellar transfers for that matter. We lucked out here. You should see the old masters that were used for ""Night Gallery"". Seems Universal's marketing department needs to take a look at what matters to customers most).

The strangest neighbors this side of the Addams Family finally make their bow on DVD. The transfers look particularly good considering the age of the material. Although lacking any notable extras (with the exception of the 15 minute pilot), the 38 first season episodes will be welcomed with open arms by fans of this quirky mixture of monsters and humor.",1094342400,9,2969,4.937875751503006
2077714,4,B0002CX1LG,"What a great television series.  My family and I sat down to watch this box set the night of the release.  It was wonderful, seeing Herman and Lilly after all these years, with no commercial interuptions.  But it all came to an end halfway through the fourth episode, when the disk began to stutter and break up, and finally freeze completely.  I took out the disk and wiped it with a cleaning cloth, just in case some dust got on it from the tiny distance it travelled from the box to the dvd player.  I took it back to the same scene with scene-access, and TA-DAH!, the same thing happened; stuttering, break up, freezing.  So I tried it on all three dvd players in my house.  Same thing.  Bad disk.  Well, I decided to skip that episode, and let my kids watch the rest.  Only to discover over the course of the next two days two more bad disks with stuttering, breaking up, freezing episodes.  As well as, bad sound quality on a couple of the episodes that did not freeze.  The volume just kept dropping and dropping, and my kids kept turning up the volume higher and higher.  I found this out when I turned on the tv later on the second day, and BOOM, the sound was so high I was afraid for my hearing.  So, as soon as the company I ordered this through sends me my replacement disks, I will write a hopefully nicer, happier, kinder review.

I will say this for Universal, at least they make it nearly impossible to complain to their customer service department.  I searched all over their website, listed on the Munster box set, and finally just sent it to thier general suggestion e-mail.  Of course I'm certain they sent it right on to the appropriate people, I just haven't heard anything from them yet.

To be fair to Universal, I've got a friend who also ordered his box set through the same distributer, and his so far has worked fine.  And I haven't seen any banter yet on-line about a large number of bad disks, so hopefully this is just what Star Trek fans would call an anomoly.  Adios for now.

UPDATE:  I exchanged the box-set and am having no problem with the new set.  So apparently the original box-set problem was a fluke.  As long as you can replace your set when you have a problem, there is really no reason not to buy it.  My kids love the Munsters, and so do I.  This is a nice set.  A couple of complaints; the only extra is the first half only of the original, color pilot, and no explanation why Universal didn't include the entire pilot.  I suspect it is because Image Entertainment had released a dvd with the full episode, as well as (I've heard only, because I don't have the dvd) interviews with surviving cast members and production crew.

2077716,5,B0002CX1LG,"Very few shows that are 40 years old can attract new legions of fans, but the ""Munsters"" continue to do it. The fact that the Munsters aired only 70 episodes during their brief 2 year run proves this set is worth the money, just for my wonderful memories of this great show and its loveable characters.

So many of the previous reviews are done in anticipation of the DVD release, but not much has been said about the set itself. What you get is the Munsters in their original broadcast aspect ratio of 1.33:1 with the unaired pilot in color and the first 38 episodes of the show in glorious Black & White. Other than a few minor problems, the set is well done and Universal Studios should be commended for giving us the Munsters Season One on DVD.

The sound in Dolby Digital 2.0 is very clean and well done, considering that this show is over 40 years old. The picture quality is superior to any of Munsters episodes I have seen in any previous format before. However there are some very minor specks and debris in some episodes, but really nothing to complain about. There are also a number of scenes in various episodes where the picture contrast is on the dark side and it's hard to make out some of the images or fine detail in the scene. Overall these minor problems do not take away from the great quality of this set.

The packaging is well done with nice artwork throughout. One major drawback is that the 38 episodes are on dual sided discs. While I'm not a big fan of this format, it does keep the cost down. In my opinion after seeing the original pilot in color, I think the Studio made the right choice to film the show in Black & White. Overall the Munsters Season One is hilarious and quirky fun for the whole family and the characters are just as loveable today. There's really nothing to think about if you're a fan of the show, grab your set today!!

This three-disc Dual sided DVD set has all 38 first-season episodes with remastered transfers, and includes the 15-minute pilot with different actors as Lily and Eddie, unfortunately there are no extras or commentaries.

I'd been a fan of old horror films (and still am), and I found it fresh, fun and very harmlessly corny (""Eddie, be sure to wash behind your points...""). I'm happy to own this DVD collection. The transfer is exquisite, though the sound could be better. The acting is adequately hammy and appropriate, though I'd like to know what happened to Beverly Owen (who was replaced in Season 2 by Pat Priest). Season 1 features Marilyn as a major character. All the others(Fred Gwynne, Yvonne de Carlo, Al Lewis, Butch Patrick) are endearing, I guess, as I remember from my teenage years. Current TV Comedy cannot compare with some of the original family style humor of the Munsters. Certainly, ""South Park"" and ""Scrubs"" are clever, but hardly what I'd want little kids to watch. Innocent, original, endearing, and often sweet-natured, the Munsters should be an addition to a family film library, proving that you don't need sex & violence to be entertained. Of course, there's the fantasy element; even weirdo families can be pleasant. There are always lessons to be learned from the Munsters, especially regarding their lack of greed, and kindness towards others; even the poor Marilyn, lacking the others' good looks. This is my kind of fare.",1094169600,6,1316,4.827433628318584
2077718,1,B0002CX1LG,"Buyer Beware!  I purchased The Munsters DVD box set about a week ago through Amazon.  When I received the DVD box set, on the second DVD, it must have had a scratch or something like that on it because the DVD stopped and turned itself off everytime it came to that point.  I returned it, got another box set, and I'll be damned if there wasn't the same glitch but it happened during another episode.

I buy a lot of DVDs and this is the first time this has ever happened to me.  Frankly, I think there is a bulk of bad DVDs out there for this Munsters set.  Just beware....buying this DVD could cause you a lot of unnecessary time and trouble.",1093996800,17,644,4.195121951219512
2077719,5,B0002CX1LG,"The Munsters have never looked better.  All 36 episodes of the first season on a 3 disc set.  Slim pickings on the extras, just an awesome unused color pilot.  The picture quality is outstanding, clear with an occassional scratch.

Throw an old school Munster-fest in your own home!  HUH-HUH-HUH-HUHHHHHH!",1093910400,3,305,5.142857142857143
2077720,5,B0002CX1LG,"The pilot episode in color is a real treat. You get to see what the set and actor's makeup looked like in a more true to life way. However i think the show really works better in the black and white format. The pilot has the same cast members except for a sub-par Lily and a very annoying Eddie. I'm glad they recast those roles for the series. I did notice that the sound level is different on some episodes,you may have to adjust the volume. With all the episodes included on the season one it will be fun to watch!",1093564800,7,517,4.128712871287129

2077722,5,B0002CX1LG,"Got my set yesterday. I have to say I never seen the Munsters looking this good. There is a few spots with what looks like to be snow flakes in some of the episodes,but hey this a 40 year old show. The sound is good too,but some episodes sound louder then others,I kept playing with the volume on my RCA Home Theater system,one momment every thing sounds loud and the next ever thing sounds low,very odd. Other then that This is a great set. Its nice to be able to watch The Munsters with out commercials and a TV Logo on the courner of screen. I hope season 2 will be coming out soon. And I also hope theres plans for that other Family of fright The Addams Family,I don't know who owns the rights to that show?But I would love to have there show on DVD as well. Classic stuff!",1093392000,6,777,4.152317880794702
2077723,5,B0002CX1LG,I bought the DVD season One of the Munsters the day it came out. I am a huge fan of the series and it's about time this show was released. The collection has 3 discs with over 16 hours of running time with a total of 38 episodes. The episodes look great and appear to be remastered. The audio is pretty good also. The only draw back to this set is the packagaing and the lack of special features. But overall well worth the $$$. Now where is The Addams Family Season One?,1093392000,3,471,4.075268817204301
2077724,5,B0002CX1LG,"Universal has been getting a lot of heat for releasing problematic DVDs, and rightfully so (their ""Night Gallery"" release, devoid of remastered prints, is a travesty).  But in the case of THE MUNSTERS, they got it right.  Sound and picture quality are excellent.  Menus are fun -- especially the opening menu when you first insert the DVD (has animated Herman, Grandpa and Lily moving through the screen -- really funny.)  Decent packaging, too.  Let's hope Season Two follows soon!",1093392000,5,482,5.050632911392405
2077725,5,B0002CX1LG,"thank god, FINALLY the munsters on DVD. my brain exploded when i found out about it and pre-ordered within minutes of finding out, but it has been in my hands for all of 10 minutes now, and i couldn't have even imagined how amazing this is start to finish. from amazing packaging, 30-some-odd episodes *including the never before seen pilot* and the packaging makes me remember why i got my first ""F"" in school at age 9 for writing about wanting to be a Munster when i grew up. my life is becoming complete.

2077726,5,B0002CX1LG,"""The Munsters"", what can one say about this show that hasn't already been said. I grew up watching this show and it's one of my all time favorites. Oh, yeah it's about freakin time Universal put this classic sixties show out on DVD. I've been waiting for years. I only wish two things. 1. That the producers and creators of this classic hit would of realized that this show was gold and made alot more than 2 seasons worth of episodes. ""Why did they cancel the show after only 2 seasons???"" 2. That they include a lot of extra's on season 2. Interviews with surviving cast members, behind the scenes, outtakes, bloopers etc.",1093219200,7,624,4.530973451327434

Herman Munter always tripped me out but Grandpa Munster was a Stone trip. Dude would crack on you&then get back at you. the Munsters always had some Fine Ladies on there as well. Eddie was a trip as well but didn't get alot of shine early on.this Show was One of a Kind early on.",1092528000,2,388,4.256756756756757
2077728,5,B0002CX1LG,"Just looking at the titles of each show makes me start laughing!

I was just 5 years old when the show ended in 1965 but the reruns have cracked me up since then. I can still remember eating ""Lucky Charms"" with milk while watching this hysterical parody of the American Family.",1092009600,5,277,4.431372549019608
2077729,5,B0002CX1LG,"I am overjoyed at the prospect of owning The Munsters - The Complete First Season. This series has been and probably always will be one of my all-time favorite television shows. I can still remember growing up watching the afternoon reruns on WPIX from New York.

The Munsters was created by Joe Connelly and Bob Mosher, the same team that brought Leave It To Beaver to television. Beaver was the quintessential American family sitcom of the late 50's - early 60's. Connelly and Mosher helped to establish all those nostalgic family sitcom cliches we've all come to love (or hate) in Leave It To Beaver then they went on to totally parody them in The Munsters. The first season opening credit sequence of The Munsters is a great example of the way they parodied the typical family sitcoms of the time. You see Lily Munster, housewife and mother, sending her brood off for the day in the same manner June Cleaver and Donna Reed did. Lily hands each of her loved ones their packed lunches or school books as she pinches their cheeks or gives them a little motherly kiss.

Although The Munsters was considered much less sophisticated than its 60s creepy TV rival, The Addams Family, it is overall a much more entertaining series to me. Although the subversive quality of The Addams Family continues to make it an entertaining series to watch as an adult, I have to admit I didn't enjoy it as a child. The Munsters with its broad comedy and more obvious monster characters was much more fun to watch as a kid. It's worth pointing out that even though Morticia and Gomez Addams had a fiery sexual relationship on screen, Lily and Herman Munster may have been one of the only 60s TV couples to have been seen sharing the same bed (rather than the customary twin beds).

The Munsters - The Complete First Season contains all 38 first season episodes (yes 38 shows in one season!) as well as the original unaired pilot (in color I think). It doesn't appear that there are too many more extras in this set which is a bit disappointing. I would have loved to have seen episode commentaries by surviving cast members, documentaries, behind-the-scenes footage, etc. Hey, maybe we will get some of those extras on the Second Season set?",1091491200,66,2223,4.651399491094147
2077730,5,B0002CX1LG,"THis is one of the best TV shows ever made and it is finally coming to DVD. Several years ago, I bought the book called ""The Munsters"", by author, Stephen Cox. It brought back many fond memories of the TV series. The book is no longer in publication. But with 38 episodes in the first season, this will be a great box set to enjoy watching for many years. I have watched reruns of this show since watching them when they aired in 64 and 65 and have never tired of them since. This is a must for all Munsters fans. The price is high but is worth the money.

 Some of my favorite first season episodes are: Episode 21. ""Don't Bank on Herman"", 24. ""Love Locked Out"", 30. ""Country Club Munster"", and 36. ""Hot Rod Herman"".",1091491200,6,717,4.226277372262774
2077731,5,B0002CX1LG,A Legendary show comes complete to DVD! The Munsters was a well polished show that we will never see the likes of again from TV golden age. The Munsters is one of the two best TV shows ever created And always will be.,1091404800,2,217,4.069767441860465
2077732,4,B0002CX1LG,"Now I'll admit that I was a bit too young to have really watched Munsters in their initial run. My experience is more when they hit afternoon re-runs in the early 70's as well as currently on TV land.

 I always preferred the Munsters over the Addams family as I am a big fan of classic horror and here you had the Frankenstein Monster, Dracula, Dracula's daughter and even a little wolfman. Throught the series other monsters would pop up such as the Mummy, the Creature, and I think the Invisible Man, all as relatives of the Munsters.

 The Munsters was more low-brow than the Addams family, relyinig more on slapstick humor, but I love it. The Munsters was much like any other early 60's family sitcom where the parents tried to teach the kids about life and right and wrong...they just happened to be Monsters!

 The fun is seeing them interract with people they meet and the usual reaction of the people running away in utter fear.

 Amazons description is a bit confusing at it refers to an ""unseen aired pilot"". Well how can it be unseen if it was aired????

 As I understand it, three different pilots were aired. One of which had a completely different marilyn, and Eddie. Anwyay, I won't go through the entire list of season one Eps, but here's my favorites:

 1. Munster Masquerade - Marilyn's boyfriend invites Marilyn and her family to a masquerade party. Marilyn goes as Priscilla her boyfriend as John Alden. Lily is Little Bo Peep, Grandpa is Napoleon, and Herman is King Arthur dressed in armor. At the end of the night Herman with a prize for wearing a Frankenstein costume under his suit of armor. Lily and Grandpa are insulted because that is Herman's real face! Herman doesn't realize that he is being insulted.

 Rock-a-Bye Munster--Herman and Grandpa overhear Lily and Marilyn talking and somehow get the idea that Lily is pregnant. What's really happening is Dr. Dudley's son, Elmer, is coming to stay with the Munsters while Dr. Dudley and his wife are on vacation.

 Tin Can Man--Thanks to a recommendation from an investigator of The Board of Education Eddie is in danger of being expelled from school. The only way he can stay if he makes an excellent project for the school's Science Fair; Grandpa helps he make a robot. Herman walks on stage and is thought to be the robot causing Eddie to win first prize and stay in school.

 Family Portrait--The Munsters have been chosen by Event Magazine as the average American family. Grandpa is insulted by being labeled ""average."" He disappears, jeopardizing the family's photo opportunity and the large amount of prize money that came with it. When a journalist and photographer arrive at the Munster home, Herman and Lily think they are burglars.

 Herman's Rival--Lily thinks that Herman has lost all his savings through a bad investment - when in fact he loaned it to her brother, the Wolf Man. She decides to build-up the family's funds by taking a palm-reading job in a tea room. In a plot twist Grandpa and Herman suspect that Lily is sneaking out of the house to have a love affair.

 All-Star Munster--Herman goes to the dean's office of Marilyn's college to straighten out a tuition matter. When searching for the office, he wanders into the gym and is mistaken for a student basketball star who is expected for a tryout. Herman amazes the coach with his superhuman abilities and is offered a contract to play for the college team.

 Herman the Rookie--Leo Durocher, manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers, needs a power hitter for his team. When he gets conked on the head by one of Herman's line drives from seven blocks away, he believes he has his man. He tracks Herman down and asks him to try out for the team.

 Mummy Munster--Herman arranges to meet Marilyn at the natural history museum. But he accidentally gets himself locked inside an Egyptian sarcophagus, whereupon a sleeping pill he swallowed earlier takes effect. A pair of museum curators open the box the next day and mistake the sleeping Herman for an ancient mummy. When Lily reads about their supposed scientific discovery in the newspaper, she goes to the museum and requests that the curators put Herman in a cab and send him home as soon as he wakes up.

 And wow...can you beleive a season with 38 episodes???? Great stuff...a little light on Extras though",1090800000,7,4310,4.718291054739653
