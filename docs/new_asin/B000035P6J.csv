1258164,2,B000035P6J,"Action flick with some halfway decent MA scenes in it; Speakman was still buff in this one, but I found myself fast forwarding to the fight scenes at times.  Also stars Ron Silver, who is pretty good as a bad guy.",1194998400,,213,4.195121951219512
1258165,2,B000035P6J,I'd have to say that I was very disappointed with this movie.  The fight scenes were hard to follow and the story was pretty weak.  The bad guy played a pretty good nut case and I'm a pretty big Speakman fan but overall  I'd have to say that this wasn't a very good movie.  The one thing that I'd  have to say I liked about the show is the first couple of minutes where you  can see Jeff performing some of his Kenpo techniques.  That is really the  only reason I ever put the tape in the VCR.,961977600,6,493,3.9591836734693877

7916665,2,B000035P6J,"I'm not nearly the first person to write this, but it seems like poor Jeff Speakman will never be able to live up to the high standard set for him with his first solo vehicle,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Perfect-Weapon/dp/B006A8XFUI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Perfect Weapon</a>. Such is the case with ""The Expert"" here, which has a somewhat ambitious story going for it but nowhere near the strength of its action content needed to live up to the aforementioned classic. As a matter of fact, I can't even really hold the story to this one's credit, as its core morality is so removed from mine that I can't get behind it.

The story: when a wayward lawyer (Alex Datcher,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Passenger-57/dp/B002AT8KA6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Passenger 57</a>) repeals the death sentence of a sadistic serial killer (Michael Shaner,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bloodfist/dp/630582469X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bloodfist</a>), the brother of his latest victim (Speakman) swears vengeance, eventually plotting to infiltrate the prison wherein the killer is held.

Let's get the action out of the way, first. At this stage in his career, I don't think it was possible for Speakman to have an outright bad fight scene, based solely on his masterful forms, but these just aren't the best. He lacks any credible opponents and there's nothing particularly notable about any of the setups or the choreography. There is a bit of shooting here and there, but it's forgettable. The characters and the weird things they get up to are more interesting: Michael Shaner is ridiculously wicked as the villain, James Brolin (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marcus-Welby-M-D/dp/B000SMNK16/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marcus Welby, M.D.</a>) is ridiculously cruel as the prison warden, and Alex Datcher is ridiculously wide-eyed and nave about the situations she's in, but their hammy characterizations are just about the best things the film has going for it. There's even the late Jim&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ernest/dp/B000EOOVMA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Ernest""</a>&nbsp;Varney in a small role as a sleazy weapons dealer, if the rest weren't enough for you.

This is a revenge movie, and any revenge movie must justify its retribution, but the way this one does is so single-minded that I think there was an agenda behind this. Basically, the only way the film can justify the payback-killing of a man in prison is to put him into unrealistic circumstances wherein a dangerous criminal is shown a ridiculous amount of leniency (e.g. suggest a mentally unstable serial killer become a speaker for schoolchildren? Why not!), thereby allowing him to take advantage of the situation and continue to be even more villainous - shoot, he's conveniently in the process of escaping from jail as soon as Speakman's character arrives. What bothers me most about this is how black & white it's played: it may not have been so hard to swallow if Jeff's character were at all conflicted about what he was planning to do and/or if the villain were actually psychologically unwell instead of just comic book-style malicious. Not so, and in the end, the movie seems to stand in staunch support of unanimously harsh punishments for criminals and accuses the ""bleeding heart liberal"" of stifling judicial efficiency.

Also, the film's pacing is kind of weird: though the meat of the story is the protagonist's plan to infiltrate the prison and get his revenge, he doesn't even get the idea until an hour in to the movie, and isn't even inside the jail until the last 15-20 minutes. This won't kill the film for you if you already don't like it, like me, but it certainly won't do it any favors, seeing at least half of the action scenes don't take place until then. Plainly, this is one very flawed movie, and I doubt that even many people who don't take offense to the plot would get much of a kick out of it otherwise. Sorry, Jeff, but you've definitely done better.",1379548800,3,4186,5.671451355661882
