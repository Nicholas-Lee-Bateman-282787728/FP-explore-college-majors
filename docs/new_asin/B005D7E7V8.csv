4657400,1,B005D7E7V8,"The best episode ever was ""Nudist Colony"", which still remains unreleased.  You can still find it on YouTube, but that's the only place I've ever found it.",1333411200,4,155,4.7407407407407405
4657401,5,B005D7E7V8,"Got this for my boyfriend, since he likes Beavis and Butt-head. He didn't have the DVD, so what more could he ask for! I thought the cover was messed up because it had some smudges, and it looked like it was ripped! Actually, it was supposed to look like that, so if you see that, there's nothing wrong with it. In general, it was a great DVD and it was hilarious. I didn't like Beavis and Butt-head until recently, so that should tell you something. If you like Beavis and Butt-head, you should definitely get this item.",1322438400,,521,4.381443298969073
4657402,5,B005D7E7V8,I love Beavis and Butthead and this DVD has some of the best!  Nosebleed is always funny. This is definitely something I was happy to add to my collection!,1320105600,,155,4.344827586206897
4657403,3,B005D7E7V8,"Yes, I confess, I love these guys!  So, even though, I already had the 3 volume set, being a collector any chance I can get of Beavis & Butt-Head, I had to have this.  Having all 3 parts of ""Taint Of Greatness"" together for the first time, was a treat.  Seeing key points of ""Holy Cornholio"" was, uh, like awesome or sumthin.'  Uh, huh, huh, huh.",1318636800,2,346,4.196969696969697
4657404,1,B005D7E7V8,"just a heads up, all these episodes are available on the collections mostly vol 2. There is NOTHING new here. I would like to see Tornado, Way Down Mexico Way parts 1 and 2,Stewarts house etc. released on dvd and blu ray. Mike Judge should really smarten up, us fans are the ones that buy the products. Who cares what episodes he thinks are good? We want Every episode uncut.",1318032000,18,375,4.371428571428571
4657405,1,B005D7E7V8,"Anyone who has the 3 box sets knows this one is a waste of time.  All the episodes here are on those other sets.

That being said, where are the episodes that are NOT on those three sets?  Classics such as Way Down Mexico Way (parts I & II) and Stewart's House (the infamous episode that got the show in trouble).  I'd pay good money to see THOSE episodes in a box set.  And more music videos, like the Overkill one with the flying skull.

I guess this is a good set for casuals, though.",1317859200,17,487,4.073684210526316
4657406,1,B005D7E7V8,"All the episodes(& Frog Baseball) contained in this release are ALL previously released in the B&B The Mike Judge Collect. Vol's 1-3! Not 1 episode is unreleased.  Some brief teases of the upcoming new episodes due end of Oct. 2011. If you own none of the former dvd boxed sets, this dvd is cheap enough for a quick fix of Beavis & Butthead to tide you over till the new shows air on MTV.",1317686400,26,388,4.243243243243243

8466372,5,B005D7E7V8,"I gave this gift to my younger brother and he loved it!! couldn't stop laughing, he didn't grow up watching Beavis and Butthead so I wasn't sure if he'd like it.
