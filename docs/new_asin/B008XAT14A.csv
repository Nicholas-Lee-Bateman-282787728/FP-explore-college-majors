8531730,5,B008XAT14A,"I had both the Mill Creek Entertainment Box set in this already.  I bought this mainly because both of these had all the same movies, but the packaging was more compact & it saved space in my DVD/Blu-Ray Shelve(s).  And with my movie collection is quite Large & Extensive (Hoverng around 2100).
  But many of these films are B to Z rate.  And the film transfers on some of these is not that great.  But in many cases, I find that this only adds to the viewing experience when I watch them.  I have almost always had a great experience with Mill Creek Entertainment's products.  While many of the same movies seem to show up in multiple movie packs, this being no exception, they always include other movies that one has either NEVER seen or rarely have seen since their release.  This being no exception.  If you are a Horror Fanatic (and I seem to fit into this catagory), do yourself a favor.  Buy the Midnight Horror Theater-32 Film Collection for yourself, you won't be dsappointed.",1396569600,,986,4.545454545454546
8531731,5,B008XAT14A,"This contains the ""Gorehouse Greats Collection"" box as 12 of the movies.  The quality is as good as any Mill Creek.  I love these old crappy movies, so I'm happy.",1396569600,,162,4.366666666666666

8531733,4,B008XAT14A,"dont expect much from this.
most of them have pops and hiss.
even with all the issues still a collection worth having.",1357257600,2,118,4.409090909090909
8531734,5,B008XAT14A,"As much as a misanthrope despises excursions amongst the untermensch, so there are certain necessities that need to be addressed. So among one of these outings, sometimes something catches the evil eye that may be worth the possession. This collection is one such veritable 'devil send', as it were, containing all of these wonderful films that perhaps may have been missed to grace one's entertainment fare, as well as a couple of stead favorites.

There must have been some diabolical inspiration involved here. Wrapped up in a splendid print {note the Nightmare Before Xmas script} featuring Bela Lugosi, Christopher Lee, & Vincent Price, here we have The Undead: Vampire Collection coupled with the Gorehouse Greats collection. The previous being a vampire's delight, the latter being a veritable Satan fest of horror treats.

The Undead: Vampire Collection is sanguinariously filled with these {favorites and previously possessed features marked with an asterisk}:

Atom Age Vampire, The Bat*, Blood of Dracula's Castle, The Bloody Vampire, Count Dracula & His Vampire Bride, The Devil Bat*, Horrible Sexy Vampire, Horror Express*, Ironbound Vampire, The Last Man On Earth, Nightmare Castle, ""Nosferatru"" [sic] {Nosferatu*}, Prime Evil*, Terror Creatures From The Grave, The Vampire Bat, Vampire Happening, Vampire's Night Orgy, The Werewolf Verses Vampire Women {The Werewolf Vs. The Vampire Woman*}, & The Witches Mountain.

Gorehouse Greats contains these devilish delights:

Blood Of Dracula's Castle, Blood Mania, Brain Twisters, The Devil's Hand*, The Madmen Of Mandoras, Nightmare In Wax, Prime Evil*, Satan's Slave*, Stanley, Terrified, Terror, & Trip With The Teacher.

Besides the obvious titles & descriptions on the jackets, ""The Undead: Vampire Collection"" is fully decorated with a list of the films on the five DVD's themselves, while ""Gorehouse Greats"" are three two-sided discs which should be accompanied with labels, which can be personally added, either printed or hand-written, while both collections' discs are elegantly preserved in black sleeves. There are only a couple of duplicates, but all the better to preserve these for posterity. One or two amusing misspellings, but that's neither here nor there. Also great for 'viewing parties' as a veritable 'marathon' to accompany 'other activities', if so inclined...

These, of course, will be reviewed in due time. In the meantime, it is a decided pleasure to immerse oneself in these worlds of horror. ",1352937600,12,2482,5.496062992125984
