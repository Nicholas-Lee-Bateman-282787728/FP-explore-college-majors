8174476,5,B000N3SU74,"Not a great movie classic BUT as far as Pirate movies go ( I have 40 of this genre)  it is one of the best out there

I like it because it sticks to its pirate theme and is not a pirate rom-com as many of these movies become",1404000000,,224,3.5510204081632653
8174477,3,B000N3SU74,I love to see Bud Spencer and Terence Hill movies! They were an awesome team and fun watching them together! This movie was not their best and the sound was not so good but it is one of theirs so it is in my collection. Is still fun to watch.,1382400000,,242,3.86
8174478,1,B000N3SU74,"I ordered The Black Pirate that was suppose to star Terrance hill and Bud Spencer,but amazon sent me The Black Pirate starring Douglas Fairbanks Jr. which was made in the 1920's. Not interested in this movie,wasn;t what i ordered. Amazon has done good on everything else so far,but this movie.",1315612800,2,293,4.88
8174479,1,B000N3SU74,"This is not a typical Terence Hill - Bud Spencer movie. It is not funny, nor is it anything to talk about. Sadly, it is conpletely ruined by the 4:3 aspect of this release. I hate to say it, but Amazon should be ashamed for releasing such a sad DVD. The movie was filmed in widescreen, this release in 4:3 so badly crops the movie that it is more often than not the viewer cannot follow the flow of the movie. Having bought other movies with Terence Hill and finding them in 4:3, I should know better, but this is is a warning to you other fans. There are widescreen versions out there, you just have to search for them.
My advice is to avoid this film entirely in 4:3 from Amazon. Either source it from somewhere that says it is widescreen, or just don't bother, you really aren't missing anything either way.",1249776000,2,810,4.300653594771242
8174480,1,B000N3SU74,"Loving these guys,Terence Hill and Bud Spencer,movies,I wanted more.
Picked up this one. Big mistake.
There is just nothing going on here at all.
I have the Trinity movies,Watch out we're mad,Crime Busters and I'm for Hippo which are a laugh,that both me and my son loves to watch together.
So if you like those,there is nothing like them in this one,sorry.
Avoid at all cost. Liked the medusa like hair on the lead lady though,hence my on star.",1226361600,4,445,4.6455696202531644
8174481,5,B000N3SU74,"There are two versions, the English and the Italian versions.  The Italian version has much better color and sound, while the English version had faded color, cropped picture size and poor sound.  I'm disappointed in the quality of the English version and wished I had known that before I bought the DVD.",1199059200,5,304,4.826923076923077
8174482,3,B000N3SU74,"This is just a fair movie. The copy fair as well. Not a clear,crisp picture, but not bad. It's watchable. Audio could be better too.
This is not a comedy, but it does have some funny parts. But,I am a fan of Hill/Spencer, so I feel it is worth the money. It is dubbed in English. This is the only copy of this movie available for dvd (I think).",1184198400,4,344,4.0
