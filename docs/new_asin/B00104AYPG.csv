8236859,5,B00104AYPG,"Prodigy was a good term to describe Ronald Sinclair as an actor - just like his contemporaries Freddie Bartholomew, Jackie Cooper and others.
The first time I saw the movie A Christmas Carol (1938) recently, I recognized Ronald Sinclair as young Scrooge.  Then, Dangerous Holiday was available with a penchant to portray a prodigy as a wimp but capable of standing with other youth his age.  In the role of Ronald Kimball a violin prodigy, Sinclair is brilliant to show how he wants time to play and walk about like other youth.  It was a pleasure to view things and people that were part of my youth at the movies and the first television shows with cathedral doors on cars, tires with inner-tubes and a band director who could have passed for a youthful Don Dellouise.  Young boys who swam in rivers - sometimes nude.  Then hitching rides on a highway.  There used to be a time in America, where a youngster could go all over the countryside with no danger as any adult watch out for their well-being.  The real purpose of this movie was to demonstrate the value of a person as a human being not what they owned, demanded to perform, or overburdened to work.  This is a five star performance by a boy star, Ronald Sinclair who died in 1999 - ironically the same year Freddie Bartholomew was deceased.",1470700800,,1302,4.55793991416309
8236860,5,B00104AYPG,"Despite the title, it's actually a sweet, adventurous melodrama.  Ronald Sinclair, the boy, completely carries the film with adorable charm and charisma.  He seems to out-act everyone in the film - including Ms. Hopper.  (What makes the film appealing too, is the classes versus masses subplot.  The only one who seems to blend with both is the boy - since he's genuine and down to earth.)
I'm a classic movie fan, and must confess that this is now a favorite film of mine.
I'd HIGHLY recommend it for anyone who likes adventure, family, drama, or classic films.",1381708800,2,562,4.762886597938144

8236862,3,B00104AYPG,This is a little pastiche from the 1930s. It helps to pass the time. I wish there was more of the violin and less of the melodrama.,1349654400,,131,3.888888888888889
8236863,3,B00104AYPG,"The star of this movie is Ronald Sinclair (Ra Hould), a very attractive boy, often compared to the more famous Freddie Bartholomew and who later starred in his most popular movie, Thoroughbreds Don't Cry (1937), which also starred Mickey Rooney and Judy Garland.  Interestingly, both boys, born in 1924, were popular during the 1930's, when pretty and sophisticated (some would say sissy) boys were the rage in movies, and both died in 1992.  I give the movie only three stars because the story line is so light it almost floats, and the quality of the movie, though clear enough, needs some digital remastering.  However, it is a trip back to a seemingly more innocent time, and Amazon offers it at a quite reasonable price.",1246406400,,725,4.830645161290323
