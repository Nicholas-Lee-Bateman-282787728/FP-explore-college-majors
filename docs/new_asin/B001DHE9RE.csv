3529558,4,B001DHE9RE,"A great completion to the episode collection of ""Are You Afraid of The Dark?"". Contains at least some very awesome episodes, particularly The Tale of The Silver Sight, The Last Dance, and The Many Faces. The only downfall to this product is that in The Night Nurse, the people's voices go out of sync during the last half of the episode. Other than that, this DVD is great and is a must have for any fan of the show!",1230681600,4,416,4.2784810126582276

8293217,5,B001DHE9RE,Are You Afraid of the Dark? was a classic show that ran during the 90s on Nickelodeon. This is the perfect opportunity to get your hands on this great show. I suggest that you buy each season individually because its a better deal.,1423958400,,231,4.395348837209302
