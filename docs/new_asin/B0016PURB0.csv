3162888,4,B0016PURB0,"Well, it's finally here; the fifth and final season of the heroic hit series ""Teen Titans"".  For the first time on two fabulous DVDs you'll witness the final 13 episodes of the series like:

""Homecoming"" - A two-parter where we meet the Doom Patrol, the team Beast Boy used to join, and the Titans help them save the day.

""For Real"" - Control Freak returns, but is surprised to see the Titans East for a change.  Either way, he tests the new team with some very difficult challenges.

""Revved Up"" - The Titans and some of their worst enemies go head to head in a race that's totally freaky.

""Go"" - It's the episode you've been waiting for.  The Titans origin story where the fearless five meet each other and how they became friends by saving the town together.

""Things Change"" - After winning the greatest battle of all time, Beast Boy is shocked to see some differences in the city, and what's more surprising is seeing a girl that totally looks like his old friend Terra.

A special feature in this set is seeing inside specs from the ""Teen Titans Friends and Foes Gallery"".  Believe me, this season has a whole lot more heroes and villains than ever before !

Well, lots of good things must come to an end and this series totally proves it being the finale season and all.  And another thing, the comic book series ""Teen Titans GO!"" has also seen its final days as well.  (However, a similar series called ""Tiny Titans"" is currently running where you'll see younger versions of the Titans and other heroes, too.)

If you have the previous four seasons plus the feature-length movie ""Trouble in Tokyo"", this will be your final volume of the Titans.  If you're looking for more heroes, watch the new ""Ben 10 Alien Force"" and ""Transformers Animated"" episodes currently playing on Cartoon Network.  And coming soon, new shows like ""Secret Saturdays"" will be coming this fall in an all-new lineup on Fridays !  Hope you'll like them.",1218153600,5,1935,4.611111111111111
3162889,5,B0016PURB0,"it's the final season in the series, and they finished off great. i love the titans. BB is my favorite, and this one was pretty much chock-full of him, his origins, Terra's return and his reaction, him kicking Slade's butt alone, and a few other connected episodes where Beast Boy saved the day without the other (original) Titans around to help. of course it shows Starfire's origin, they all meet and the forming of the Titans, how Jinx (formerly of the H.I.V.E. FIVE) becomes an honorary Titan, and other little things...

...and they finished off strong, with virtually every villian any of the Titans have taken on coming after them all at once, taking the Titans (full and honorary) down one or two at a time. once again, BB came to the rescue, calling on the few remaining allies he had to help him launch a final attempt to save the others from their enemies. in the end, over 140 Titans stand against the remaining villians and come out on top. yay!!

so... basically, i was in cartoon heaven. now i'm just waiting to see exactly how they plan to bring the Judas Contract story arc of the Teen Titans to dvd. (Terra & Slade's story was already told, and if i remember correctly, that WAS the original Judas Contract in the comic books.) maybe (now that Terra and Slade are both back) the continuation of that story will pick up in the new movie (if they ever get around to doing it). either way, can't wait to find out.

3162890,5,B0016PURB0,"My daughter and I both love to watch cartoons and do so whenever we have an opportunity when I visit her at the University.  Neither of us had any idea that the Teen Titans program had gone into a 5th season, but when I saw that a DVD was available for that season, I e-mailed her to tell her that I was sending out for it.  Well, after we received the DVD, my daughter and I both thoroughly enjoyed all the episodes on the DVD.  But we both were very disappointed with the ending of the last episode, it was so abrupt. Beast boy just walked into a blinding light to follow a course of action, and that was it!!!  The episode left us hanging and we both asked the question ""What happened?""  This can't be the end of the DVD, but it was.  So-o-o-o, when is season 6 coming out, or is it?  We hope it won't be like Code Lyoko which left everyone hanging wondering if they were going to find Aelita's father and materialise him again.  We understand that there won't be any more new Code Lyoko episodes made because its claimed that there is not enough interest shown by the viewing public.  And that's a real bummer, especially if you've been watching the program each year and it was getting really interesting the last year it was presented.",1217808000,4,1241,4.314655172413793
3162891,5,B0016PURB0,"This video was amazing! A perfect way to end a wonderful and beautiful show. You need to buy it....right now. All of the episodes were very cool, and they had several episodes with new titans, like Jinx, jericho, and Killowatt. They also have old favorites liek Speedy, Wildebeast, and Hot Spot.

Plus, this DVD has classics, like Lightspeed and the heartbreaking ending to the series, Things Change.",1217635200,6,400,4.970149253731344
3162892,4,B0016PURB0,"Teen Titans has always been a strong series.  This fifth and final season is a particular favorite of mine in that it features the Doom Patrol and the Brotherhood of Evil (BoE is in a number of episodes throughout the season).  Now, I was not a Doom Patrol fan prior.  In fact, I've never even read a Doom Patrol comic.  Regardless, I simply love the characterizations of the team in the show, especially Negative Man's deadpan delivery of his lines, as is so befitting his name.

Likewise, Brain having the Hawking'esque voice is beyond perfect.  Here we have a brilliant and evil mind with no body to speak of that commands immeasurable power.  I love the taunting coming from Brain sounding like a late 80's computer attempting to create speech.  It has a menace to it that one wouldn't expect.

With the Brotherhood of Evil, and the Doom Patrol playing such a large roll in this season, the feel of the overall story arc feels a lot more Silver Age, DC Comics than the previous seasons, which for me is a good thing.  While the Slade arcs are excellent, there is something I like about two super teams duking it out, 60's style.  There's a grandness to that just feels, I don't know . . . heroic in that romantic, adventure movie kind of way.

There are some other really great episodes as well.  In particular, I enjoyed ""Go!,"" a prequel episode that details not only how Starfire came to Earth, but also how the Titans originally formed their team.  It's great.

DC/Marvel has had an incredible run of quality animated hero shows, going all the way back to ""Batman: the Animated Series"" and this season of Teen Titans delivers as well.  If your looking at a review for season five, I'm going to presume you've seen the show and like it, so I am probably preaching to the choir.  It's great.  You know it.  What else is there to know?

BTW, why in the world doesn't every DVD box set/series in universe simply list the frickin' episodes in the description?  It always falls to a reviewer to actually tell prospective buyers what the heck they are considering buying.  Does this strike anyone else as a bit stupid?

To that end, here's a list of episodes contained within the series:

1. Homecoming Pt 1 (Intro the Doom Patrol and the Brotherhood of Evil)
2. Homecoming Pt 2
3. Trust
4. For Real
5. Snowblind
6. Kole
7. Hide and Seek
8. Lightspeed
9. Revved Up (This one seemed REALLY odd and jarringly outside the Titans Universe, but whatever)
10. Go!
11. Calling All Titans
12. Titans Together
13. Things Change",1217289600,44,2518,4.544444444444444
3162893,5,B0016PURB0,"This is the final season of the hit ""Teen Titans"" show and it certainly doesn't downgrade in quality, despite what some say. On the contrary, it's one of the best seasons in my opinion. The final season's episodes mostly focus on a single threat, the Brotherhood of Evil and their aim to eliminate all Titans globally. For once episodes not only follow the main Titans but also feature other Titans as well. It's a nice change once in awhile to follow other Titan's adventures besides the main group just for new perspectives offered by other heroes.

If you liked the previous seasons of Teen Titans, then definitely pick this up. You won't be disappointed, as it's on par with the other seasons.",1215475200,18,697,4.713114754098361
3162894,3,B0016PURB0,"After being dominated by awesome villians like Slade, Brother Blood, and Trigon in the previous seasons, the final season of Teen Titans is finally showing its age and looking a bit weary.  The recurring villians here are a passionless robotic skull called The Brain (not to be confused with the much more entertaining megalomaniac lab mouse featured on Animaniacs and Pinky and the Brain) and a talking gorilla named Monsieur Mallah (not to be confused with the much more entertaining Grodd on Justice League).  One of the plusses of Season 5 is that we finally get to see a lot of the lesser known Teen Titans that were featured in the original comics, including Jericho, Argent, and Kole.  We also get treated to the episode ""Go!"" which depicts how the original five Titans came together as a team (Starfire in particular is quite different in the beginning; very aggressive and antisocial which is definitely not how she is later).  However, the influx of hordes of new characters make things rather chaotic, especially in the two part climax where The Brain and Monsieur Mallah meet their end.  Also beware of the very last and downbeat episode ""Things Change,"" which brings back a long lost character who has amnesia and never quite recovers from it.",1212364800,11,1256,4.877934272300469

3162939,3,B0016PURB0,"I love the character development-especially Beast Boy's- and the overall deep maturity of the cartoon was incredible and intriguing. This is something rarely seen in such humorous TV shows, which is why it is so much better than the all new 'Teen Titans Go!' series. I am absolutely positively disappointed with the cliff hanger in the final episode. Way to many unanswered questions and so much more that could have been done. Why did the show have to be canceled?

Robin, Starfire, Cyborg, Beast Boy, and Raven  face Brain, Madam Rouge, Monsieur Mallah, and General Immortus in an all-out battle!

3163187,5,B0016PURB0,I think there should be a new season because the last episode made no sense I think they should show more about what the titans do to the monster they were fighting and if that girl was actually terra or if the Brotherhood of Evil comes back or if someone releases all the Brotherhood of Evil and they start taking down titans  again robin should be with star I really hope u liked all of the series there should really be a new season I hope u think so tooK love this whole show especially the episode go! it shows that star really likes robin I hope there is gonna be more seasons because the last episode was confusing and if they come out with a new season or more than one it should show all about or some of the Brotherhood of Evil coming back and ha've a huge battle but  they bring back ravens dad and all the titans and the honerary titans all fight him and raven should learn some new spells Jerichos power is awesome I'm sorry for blabbing about everything and going on and on about this but I think they should show a few more seasons since I have to go to school I have to tape it every day I hope Warner bros makes a knew season I love this whole show but I still have more to watch I thought the end episode 1 2 and 3 was good I'm really waiting for a few more seasons to come out Warner bros if u are reading this plz come out with a few more seasons.

I'm sorry for talking about seasons so much it might make a few people mad since I keep going on and on about seasons but plz send Warner bros messages and maybe one day there might just be a few more seasons or talk to them about making knew seasons or if they are reading this there might be some hope that one day there will be a commercial about some knew seasons coming.

3163216,5,B0016PURB0,"I think this season ties with the third as the best season of the show! I liked how the Titans were on a global war against The Brotherhood of Evil, very impressive villains! The Titans met a majority of new heroes, went on many great adventures, and learned great lessons as well! I loved seeing Raven babysit little kids, the titan least fit for the job. I liked seeing Jinx change from bad to good, and I especially liked ""Titans Together""! Beast Boy lead the attack, all heroes and most of the recurring villains were in one huge epic battle, it was just awesome! The one major problem I have with this season is the episode ""Things Change"". It was really sad and embarrassing to see Beast Boy go through a difficult change, but I think anyone would have this feeling if they did not like change. Besides, I am glad it was not the real finale of the series. The Tokyo film was and I liked it. So I guess the series managed to redeem itself. Despite ""Things Change"" being a major flaw, the good stuff in the other episodes are just too darn good! I just adore it!",1377993600,3,1066,4.335

3163219,5,B0016PURB0,"If you enjoyed previous episodes or seasons of Teen Titans, you will enjoy this one. Same anime-inspired art style. Same action. Same jokes. Same kids.
This one has one of the better overarching story lines though. Possibly the best. And it was obvious that they knew they were ending because they pulled out all the stops.
They delved into the titans past to give us Beast Boy's former teammates, the Doom Patrol and their enemies, the Brotherhood of Evil. We see Beast Boy really come into his own this year and even see an episode which shows how the Titans first got together and another which holds the arrival of a much demanded founding character from the comics.
The final two episode showdown against the Brotherhood of Evil remains one of my favorite climaxes in TV animation, right up there with the end of season one of Justice League Unlimited, and of Young Justice: Invasion.
My only true complaint lies with the fact that Starfire was never truly given her own storyline. She deserved one.
Also, a caveat. The final episode, after the two episode climax, is bittersweet. A completely different tone than the rest of the season. If you want to end on a triumphant note, that is not the episode to watch. Consider watching it out of order. But if you want to see the goodbye that the creators intended, stick with it. It is a goodbye to innocence and to the Titans. Appropriate, bit like I said, bittersweet.",1373328000,,1421,4.665338645418327

3163256,4,B0016PURB0,"If there were anyway to wrap up this show this would be how I envisioned it. The season starts with the focus on Beast Boy and his former team the Doom Squad (Stupid name I know but I think it is accurate to the source material). Then the whole season is built on the main villian, The Brain, building a army of Supervillians to destroy the Titans and all affiliated members. It all Culminates in a epic throw down between Good Guys (Titans) and Bad Guys (Brain Squad.

The only thing I would change as the last episode and make it that Terra & Kid Flash join the Teen Titans (East) and maybe have Cyborg Graduate to the Justice Leauge but I am getting a little ahead of myself for Justice Leauge: Doom.

All in all excellent season, excellent show and I hope that Young Justice (Which I have yet to check out) is as good as the Teen Titans",1330992000,,840,4.24375
3163257,5,B0016PURB0,"""Teen Titans- The Complete Fifth Season"" offers thirteen crisp episodes of terrific, imaginative superhero adventure, and with a minimum of those cartoony excesses (eyes bugging, exclamation points appearing over characters' heads, etc.) that often got out of control in previous seasons.  There's also a strong continuity between episodes, making the whole season come off as a kind of meaty novel covering a year in the life of Robin, Starfire, Beast Boy, Raven, and Cyborg.

Highlights include multiple confrontations with the Brotherhood of Evil (culminating in a great two-parter near the end of the season), a look at Beast Boy's pre-Titans career with the Doom Patrol (another cool group), and an episode showing how the Teen Titans (at least the cartoon version of them) got together in the first place.  The season (and series, actually) concludes with a strikingly subtle and heartbreaking final episode starring Beast Boy, that demonstrates that not everything works out in the end, not even for colorful, upbeat heroes.

I enjoyed all five seasons of ""Teen Titans"", which I've watched over the past year or two on DVD.  All that's left is the extra-long, movie-style adventure, ""Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo"".  Once I'm done with that, it's going be a challenge finding another animated series at the same quality level to immerse myself in next.",1323302400,,1359,5.2110091743119265

Each season is clean, intelligent fun. Moral choices are shown along with consequences and there is a clear good or evil differentiation. The characters look great and the stories don't lag. I like that the episodes continue the overall storyline as well. And you can't beat the price on Amazon!

I especially loved season four with it's dark main story line mixed with incredibly fun filler episodes.  The fifth, and final, season took the serious tone of season four and amped it up, perhaps a little too much for the shows good.  The worldwide romp the Titans go through and the gathering of all the young super heroes was a good story line, but it left little room for some of the more playful episodes of the previous seasons.  In fact, the entire season seemed to be absorbed in the main story line.  Not saying that it was bad, in fact it was a pretty good story line, but it just didn't feel as fun as the previous seasons.  Especially the last episode of the season, ""Things Change,"" which seemed to end the show on somewhat of a downer.  In short, this season is probably best for those fans who are finally in their teen years, but not for the younger ones.",1220745600,3,1049,4.321428571428571
3163292,5,B0016PURB0,"A couple of years ago, I wrote to Warner Bros asking them to bring back the great quality of incidental music in their cartoons, quoting Batman TAS, Superman TAS as my favourite examples.
I think they listened. The first two episodes of this season ""Homecoming Part 1 & 2"" feature a fantastic score of dramatic music, which complements the guest characters: The Doom Patrol. The story shows Beast Boy's connection to his former team, and his divided loyalty between the Doom Patrol and the Titans.
Doom Patrol's enemies the Brotherhood of Evil (led by M'sieur Mallah & Madam Rouge) become the main focus of the Titans for the rest of the season, which sends them on a global quest to sign up honorary Titans galore.
In ""Lightspeed"", you'll see Kid Flash (voiced by Michael Rosenbaum, who voiced the adult future version of the character in Justice League/Unlimited as The Flash). Lots of other guest characters familiar to DC comics including Red Star (a retooled version of the Russian Starfire from Teen Titans original comic series #18).
This is the best season, and a great way to wrap up the series. Watch out for the surprising final episode, featuring the return of ... I won't spoil it.",1219881600,6,1194,4.800970873786408

3397385,4,B0016PURB0,"Well, it's finally here; the fifth and final season of the heroic hit series ""Teen Titans"".  For the first time on two fabulous DVDs you'll witness the final 13 episodes of the series like:

""Homecoming"" - A two-parter where we meet the Doom Patrol, the team Beast Boy used to join, and the Titans help them save the day.

""For Real"" - Control Freak returns, but is surprised to see the Titans East for a change.  Either way, he tests the new team with some very difficult challenges.

""Revved Up"" - The Titans and some of their worst enemies go head to head in a race that's totally freaky.

""Go"" - It's the episode you've been waiting for.  The Titans origin story where the fearless five meet each other and how they became friends by saving the town together.

""Things Change"" - After winning the greatest battle of all time, Beast Boy is shocked to see some differences in the city, and what's more surprising is seeing a girl that totally looks like his old friend Terra.

A special feature in this set is seeing inside specs from the ""Teen Titans Friends and Foes Gallery"".  Believe me, this season has a whole lot more heroes and villains than ever before !

Well, lots of good things must come to an end and this series totally proves it being the finale season and all.  And another thing, the comic book series ""Teen Titans GO!"" has also seen its final days as well.  (However, a similar series called ""Tiny Titans"" is currently running where you'll see younger versions of the Titans and other heroes, too.)

If you have the previous four seasons plus the feature-length movie ""Trouble in Tokyo"", this will be your final volume of the Titans.  If you're looking for more heroes, watch the new ""Ben 10 Alien Force"" and ""Transformers Animated"" episodes currently playing on Cartoon Network.

3397386,5,B0016PURB0,"it's the final season in the series, and they finished off great. i love the titans. BB is my favorite, and this one was pretty much chock-full of him, his origins, Terra's return and his reaction, him kicking Slade's butt alone, and a few other connected episodes where Beast Boy saved the day without the other (original) Titans around to help. of course it shows Starfire's origin, they all meet and the forming of the Titans, how Jinx (formerly of the H.I.V.E. FIVE) becomes an honorary Titan, and other little things...

...and they finished off strong, with virtually every villian any of the Titans have taken on coming after them all at once, taking the Titans (full and honorary) down one or two at a time. once again, BB came to the rescue, calling on the few remaining allies he had to help him launch a final attempt to save the others from their enemies. in the end, over 140 Titans stand against the remaining villians and come out on top. yay!!

so... basically, i was in cartoon heaven. now i'm just waiting to see exactly how they plan to bring the Judas Contract story arc of the Teen Titans to dvd. (Terra & Slade's story was already told, and if i remember correctly, that WAS the original Judas Contract in the comic books.) maybe (now that Terra and Slade are both back) the continuation of that story will pick up in the new movie (if they ever get around to doing it). either way, can't wait to find out.

3397387,5,B0016PURB0,"My daughter and I both love to watch cartoons and do so whenever we have an opportunity when I visit her at the University.  Neither of us had any idea that the Teen Titans program had gone into a 5th season, but when I saw that a DVD was available for that season, I e-mailed her to tell her that I was sending out for it.  Well, after we received the DVD, my daughter and I both thoroughly enjoyed all the episodes on the DVD.  But we both were very disappointed with the ending of the last episode, it was so abrupt. Beast boy just walked into a blinding light to follow a course of action, and that was it!!!  The episode left us hanging and we both asked the question ""What happened?""  This can't be the end of the DVD, but it was.  So-o-o-o, when is season 6 coming out, or is it?  We hope it won't be like Code Lyoko which left everyone hanging wondering if they were going to find Aelita's father and materialise him again.  We understand that there won't be any more new Code Lyoko episodes made because its claimed that there is not enough interest shown by the viewing public.  And that's a real bummer, especially if you've been watching the program each year and it was getting really interesting the last year it was presented.",1217808000,4,1241,4.314655172413793

3397389,4,B0016PURB0,"Teen Titans has always been a strong series.  This fifth and final season is a particular favorite of mine in that it features the Doom Patrol and the Brotherhood of Evil (BoE is in a number of episodes throughout the season).  Now, I was not a Doom Patrol fan prior.  In fact, I've never even read a Doom Patrol comic.  Regardless, I simply love the characterizations of the team in the show, especially Negative Man's deadpan delivery of his lines, as is so befitting his name.

Likewise, Brain having the Hawking'esque voice is beyond perfect.  Here we have a brilliant and evil mind with no body to speak of that commands immeasurable power.  I love the taunting coming from Brain sounding like a late 80's computer attempting to create speech.  It has a menace to it that one wouldn't expect.

With the Brotherhood of Evil, and the Doom Patrol playing such a large roll in this season, the feel of the overall story arc feels a lot more Silver Age, DC Comics than the previous seasons, which for me is a good thing.  While the Slade arcs are excellent, there is something I like about two super teams duking it out, 60's style.  There's a grandness to that just feels, I don't know . . . heroic in that romantic, adventure movie kind of way.

There are some other really great episodes as well.  In particular, I enjoyed ""Go!,"" a prequel episode that details not only how Starfire came to Earth, but also how the Titans originally formed their team.  It's great.

DC/Marvel has had an incredible run of quality animated hero shows, going all the way back to ""Batman: the Animated Series"" and this season of Teen Titans delivers as well.  If your looking at a review for season five, I'm going to presume you've seen the show and like it, so I am probably preaching to the choir.  It's great.  You know it.  What else is there to know?

BTW, why in the world doesn't every DVD box set/series in universe simply list the frickin' episodes in the description?  It always falls to a reviewer to actually tell prospective buyers what the heck they are considering buying.  Does this strike anyone else as a bit stupid?

To that end, here's a list of episodes contained within the series:

1. Homecoming Pt 1 (Intro the Doom Patrol and the Brotherhood of Evil)
2. Homecoming Pt 2
3. Trust
4. For Real
5. Snowblind
6. Kole
7. Hide and Seek
8. Lightspeed
9. Revved Up (This one seemed REALLY odd and jarringly outside the Titans Universe, but whatever)
10. Go!
11. Calling All Titans
12. Titans Together
13. Things Change",1217289600,44,2518,4.544444444444444
3397390,5,B0016PURB0,"This is the final season of the hit ""Teen Titans"" show and it certainly doesn't downgrade in quality, despite what some say. On the contrary, it's one of the best seasons in my opinion. The final season's episodes mostly focus on a single threat, the Brotherhood of Evil and their aim to eliminate all Titans globally. For once episodes not only follow the main Titans but also feature other Titans as well. It's a nice change once in awhile to follow other Titan's adventures besides the main group just for new perspectives offered by other heroes.

If you liked the previous seasons of Teen Titans, then definitely pick this up. You won't be disappointed, as it's on par with the other seasons.",1215475200,18,697,4.713114754098361
3397391,3,B0016PURB0,"After being dominated by awesome villians like Slade, Brother Blood, and Trigon in the previous seasons, the final season of Teen Titans is finally showing its age and looking a bit weary.  The recurring villians here are a passionless robotic skull called The Brain (not to be confused with the much more entertaining megalomaniac lab mouse featured on Animaniacs and Pinky and the Brain) and a talking gorilla named Monsieur Mallah (not to be confused with the much more entertaining Grodd on Justice League).  One of the plusses of Season 5 is that we finally get to see a lot of the lesser known Teen Titans that were featured in the original comics, including Jericho, Argent, and Kole.  We also get treated to the episode ""Go!"" which depicts how the original five Titans came together as a team (Starfire in particular is quite different in the beginning; very aggressive and antisocial which is definitely not how she is later).  However, the influx of hordes of new characters make things rather chaotic, especially in the two part climax where The Brain and Monsieur Mallah meet their end.  Also beware of the very last and downbeat episode ""Things Change,"" which brings back a long lost character who has amnesia and never quite recovers from it.",1212364800,11,1256,4.877934272300469

This is something rarely seen in such humorous TV shows, which is why it is so much better than the all new 'Teen Titans Go!' series.

Robin, Starfire, Cyborg, Beast Boy, and Raven  face Brain, Madam Rouge, Monsieur Mallah, and General Immortus in an all-out battle!

3397684,5,B0016PURB0,I think there should be a new season because the last episode made no sense I think they should show more about what the titans do to the monster they were fighting and if that girl was actually terra or if the Brotherhood of Evil comes back or if someone releases all the Brotherhood of Evil and they start taking down titans  again robin should be with star I really hope u liked all of the series there should really be a new season I hope u think so tooK love this whole show especially the episode go! it shows that star really likes robin I hope there is gonna be more seasons because the last episode was confusing and if they come out with a new season or more than one it should show all about or some of the Brotherhood of Evil coming back and ha've a huge battle but  they bring back ravens dad and all the titans and the honerary titans all fight him and raven should learn some new spells Jerichos power is awesome I'm sorry for blabbing about everything and going on and on about this but I think they should show a few more seasons since I have to go to school I have to tape it every day I hope Warner bros makes a knew season I love this whole show but I still have more to watch I thought the end episode 1 2 and 3 was good I'm really waiting for a few more seasons to come out Warner bros if u are reading this plz come out with a few more seasons. My teacher always says go above and beyond. a few more wouldn't hurt just talk about what they do after defeating the Brotherhood of Evil and I hope that girl is Terra I have so many ideas of what to show on the new seasons (if they come out) I am addicted  to this series I hope all of u want a few more seasons and at least a few more New heroes and I really really really want a few more seasons. I'm sorry for talking about seasons so much it might make a few people mad since I keep going on and on about seasons but plz send Warner bros messages and maybe one day there might just be a few more seasons or talk to them about making knew seasons or if they are reading this there might be some hope that one day there will be a commercial about some knew seasons coming. I really love teen titans it is a mix of comedy action and a little bit of romance but in a funny way.plz let there be at least a few more seasons.but for now on until there might be a few more seasons I will weather watch 're runs or watch teen titans fools let there be some hope. I hope u liked it and u agree with me if u do agree just click helpful or if u don't agree click not helpful plz agree there should be some more seasons!!!!!,1394409600,,2584,3.946360153256705

3397713,5,B0016PURB0,"I think this season ties with the third as the best season of the show! I liked how the Titans were on a global war against The Brotherhood of Evil, very impressive villains! The Titans met a majority of new heroes, went on many great adventures, and learned great lessons as well! I loved seeing Raven babysit little kids, the titan least fit for the job. I liked seeing Jinx change from bad to good, and I especially liked ""Titans Together""! Beast Boy lead the attack, all heroes and most of the recurring villains were in one huge epic battle, it was just awesome! The one major problem I have with this season is the episode ""Things Change"". It was really sad and embarrassing to see Beast Boy go through a difficult change, but I think anyone would have this feeling if they did not like change. Besides, I am glad it was not the real finale of the series. The Tokyo film was and I liked it. So I guess the series managed to redeem itself. Despite ""Things Change"" being a major flaw, the good stuff in the other episodes are just too darn good! I just adore it!",1377993600,3,1066,4.335

3397716,5,B0016PURB0,"If you enjoyed previous episodes or seasons of Teen Titans, you will enjoy this one. Same anime-inspired art style. Same action. Same jokes. Same kids.
This one has one of the better overarching story lines though. Possibly the best. And it was obvious that they knew they were ending because they pulled out all the stops.
They delved into the titans past to give us Beast Boy's former teammates, the Doom Patrol and their enemies, the Brotherhood of Evil. We see Beast Boy really come into his own this year and even see an episode which shows how the Titans first got together and another which holds the arrival of a much demanded founding character from the comics.
The final two episode showdown against the Brotherhood of Evil remains one of my favorite climaxes in TV animation, right up there with the end of season one of Justice League Unlimited, and of Young Justice: Invasion.
My only true complaint lies with the fact that Starfire was never truly given her own storyline. She deserved one.
Also, a caveat. The final episode, after the two episode climax, is bittersweet. A completely different tone than the rest of the season. If you want to end on a triumphant note, that is not the episode to watch. Consider watching it out of order. But if you want to see the goodbye that the creators intended, stick with it. It is a goodbye to innocence and to the Titans. Appropriate, bit like I said, bittersweet.",1373328000,,1421,4.665338645418327

The episode that features the ever, self-controlled Raven when she comes out of her shell as she has to babysit three toddler superheroes and an invisible, extremely powerful one was a fun and cute show. The final episode, without giving anything away, received mixed reviews in our house...about half liked it, half were disappointed.",1349740800,,618,5.128712871287129

3397753,4,B0016PURB0,"If there were anyway to wrap up this show this would be how I envisioned it. The season starts with the focus on Beast Boy and his former team the Doom Squad (Stupid name I know but I think it is accurate to the source material). Then the whole season is built on the main villian, The Brain, building a army of Supervillians to destroy the Titans and all affiliated members. It all Culminates in a epic throw down between Good Guys (Titans) and Bad Guys (Brain Squad.

The only thing I would change as the last episode and make it that Terra & Kid Flash join the Teen Titans (East) and maybe have Cyborg Graduate to the Justice Leauge but I am getting a little ahead of myself for Justice Leauge: Doom.

All in all excellent season, excellent show and I hope that Young Justice (Which I have yet to check out) is as good as the Teen Titans",1330992000,,840,4.24375
3397754,5,B0016PURB0,"""Teen Titans- The Complete Fifth Season"" offers thirteen crisp episodes of terrific, imaginative superhero adventure, and with a minimum of those cartoony excesses (eyes bugging, exclamation points appearing over characters' heads, etc.) that often got out of control in previous seasons.  There's also a strong continuity between episodes, making the whole season come off as a kind of meaty novel covering a year in the life of Robin, Starfire, Beast Boy, Raven, and Cyborg.

Highlights include multiple confrontations with the Brotherhood of Evil (culminating in a great two-parter near the end of the season), a look at Beast Boy's pre-Titans career with the Doom Patrol (another cool group), and an episode showing how the Teen Titans (at least the cartoon version of them) got together in the first place.  The season (and series, actually) concludes with a strikingly subtle and heartbreaking final episode starring Beast Boy, that demonstrates that not everything works out in the end, not even for colorful, upbeat heroes.

I enjoyed all five seasons of ""Teen Titans"", which I've watched over the past year or two on DVD.  All that's left is the extra-long, movie-style adventure, ""Teen Titans: Trouble in Tokyo"".  Once I'm done with that, it's going be a challenge finding another animated series at the same quality level to immerse myself in next.",1323302400,,1359,5.2110091743119265

With that premise you already hook with the story from beginning to end TEEN TITANS THE COMPLETE 5TH SEASON goes to hyperdrive, and while the saying goes it's good from beginning to end sorry to say it does not apply for me the best series finale is TITANS TOGETHER.

Still enjoy it titans fans and do not miss the extras on the heroes and villains which appeared in the last season.",1292803200,,641,4.517241379310345

3397782,5,B0016PURB0,"I started buying the Teen Titans series on DVD for my kids because they started expressing an interest in comic books. Having been a collector from childhood through college I was eager to pass my love of superheroes on and Teen Titans looked clean enough that I wouldn't have to worry. I was right.

Each season is clean, intelligent fun. Moral choices are shown along with consequences and there is a clear good or evil differentiation. The characters look great and the stories don't lag. I like that the episodes continue the overall storyline as well. And you can't beat the price on Amazon!

If you are looking for a great superhero show for your family Teen Titans is a great place to start.",1267401600,,698,4.620967741935484

3397785,5,B0016PURB0,"The final season of the Teen Titans pays off the first four seasons by looking both back [Beast Boy's first team and how the Titans came together] and forward [will the Titans endure?]all while maintaining a season-long struggle with The Brotherhood of Evil. The interplay between the Titans stays strong. Two dead foes from the past appear to be back in the coda. The staid Raven comes out of her shell when she babysits three toddler superheroes and their invisible [imaginary?] friend. Dozens of heroes and villains duke it out in the final battle. This animated series amply carries on the decade-long quality tradition begun with The Animated Batman series and Superman the Animated series although less grim in tone and incorporating more anime emotive icons. If this is your first encounter with the Teen Titans,you will find the character-driven tales satisfying  - you may even want to get the first four season [if you don't already have them]to enjoy how well the entire series holds together as a cohesive whole.",1226275200,4,1024,4.988304093567251

Great for all ages (maybe a little violent for those 1-4 years old). Better than Justice League in my opinion, but very much the same concept if you enjoyed that series.",1225670400,2,343,4.548387096774194

3397788,4,B0016PURB0,"Even though I'm pretty old to be watching cartoons like Teen Titans (or so I've been told), I have always found them fun and the stories to be rather smart for a ""tweens"" show.  I especially loved season four with it's dark main story line mixed with incredibly fun filler episodes.  The fifth, and final, season took the serious tone of season four and amped it up, perhaps a little too much for the shows good.  The worldwide romp the Titans go through and the gathering of all the young super heroes was a good story line, but it left little room for some of the more playful episodes of the previous seasons.  In fact, the entire season seemed to be absorbed in the main story line.  Not saying that it was bad, in fact it was a pretty good story line, but it just didn't feel as fun as the previous seasons.  Especially the last episode of the season, ""Things Change,"" which seemed to end the show on somewhat of a downer.  In short, this season is probably best for those fans who are finally in their teen years, but not for the younger ones.",1220745600,3,1049,4.321428571428571
3397789,5,B0016PURB0,"A couple of years ago, I wrote to Warner Bros asking them to bring back the great quality of incidental music in their cartoons, quoting Batman TAS, Superman TAS as my favourite examples.
I think they listened. The first two episodes of this season ""Homecoming Part 1 & 2"" feature a fantastic score of dramatic music, which complements the guest characters: The Doom Patrol. The story shows Beast Boy's connection to his former team, and his divided loyalty between the Doom Patrol and the Titans.
Doom Patrol's enemies the Brotherhood of Evil (led by M'sieur Mallah & Madam Rouge) become the main focus of the Titans for the rest of the season, which sends them on a global quest to sign up honorary Titans galore.
In ""Lightspeed"", you'll see Kid Flash (voiced by Michael Rosenbaum, who voiced the adult future version of the character in Justice League/Unlimited as The Flash). Lots of other guest characters familiar to DC comics including Red Star (a retooled version of the Russian Starfire from Teen Titans original comic series #18).
This is the best season, and a great way to wrap up the series. Watch out for the surprising final episode, featuring the return of ... I won't spoil it.",1219881600,6,1194,4.800970873786408
