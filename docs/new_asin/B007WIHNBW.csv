8522618,5,B007WIHNBW,This is a wonderful film that pays homage to the artistry of Anna Magnani.  Wonderful Black and white photography.  This movie is useful for anyone studying Italian language and culture.  In Italian with English subtitles.  One thing I liked about the 2nd vignette is the portrayal of Anna Magnani in the Italian countryside herding goats etc.  It clearly demonstrates on one level the close relationship with the land many rural Italians have in their lives.,1364256000,5,459,5.066666666666666
