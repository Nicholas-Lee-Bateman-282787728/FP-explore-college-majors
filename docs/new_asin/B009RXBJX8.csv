8543985,5,B009RXBJX8,"After running for more than forty years, and with little cross training, my body is not as flexible as when I was younger, my muscles are tight.  I have run sixty-- five plus marathons including Boston twice, so I have some miles on my body.  As you age and start getting slower and it can be a humbling experience. I thought if I could gain some flexibility and improve my balance, I might regain some speed.  I tried stretching and have had success but I wanted something more interesting, more hands on.  So, having participated in a few yoga classes at the fitness center I thought it might help. I started shopping for DVD's focusing on yoga for runners.

Living in Michigan gave me the opportunity to talk to a few runners who attended Hope College in Holland Michigan and had taken yoga classes from Ms. Kuipers at Hope. They said her classes were fun, challenging and rewarding and that Ms. Kuipers can teach yoga at any level. With their recommendation and because she is a runner (Michigan Female Masters Runner of the Year 2006) plus she has a master's degree in exercise physiology; I decided to buy her DVD ""Yoga for Runners and Walkers""
.
 Kuipers addresses the important areas that runners need to focus on to remain flexible.  She is extremely detailed in her explanation of how to perform the pose, getting into the pose and getting out of it, to achieve the greatest benefit.  Throughout the class she addresses possible improper technique that could cause injury and makes sure you realize the correct position for the pose to prevent injury.

Kuipers works with three students who perform at various levels: beginning, intermediate and advanced. The DVD is excellent for any runner or walker who has had experience with yoga or beginners who want to gain the benefit of flexibility and balance.  Kuipers explains, as she introduces a pose, the area of the body being stretched and how that area of the body benefits your running.

Kuipers is an excellent instructor, full of enthusiasm, explaining the poses and coaching you through the difficult ones.  As you watch her led the class, you can appreciate her knowledge and love for yoga.  Since, I started using Kuipers'  ""Yoga for Runners and Walkers""my body is more flexible feeling less sore and I seem to have more energy when I run.  My times are slowly improving but when you are older you can expect only so much improvement.

Kuipers' ""Yoga for Runners and Walker"" will help you improve flexibility and balance. You will feel better mentally, physically and will improve your running.
