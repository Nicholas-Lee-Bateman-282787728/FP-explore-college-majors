8059599,5,B0009E3392,"My 2 1/2 year old son LOVES the Wiggles.  I have had to add more and more Wiggles DVD's to our collection to keep ME from getting bored with the same old one over and over (and over and over!).  Both of these are fun to watch and feature some of our favorite songs (no ""Little Wiggles"" or animated Wiggles which we don't really care for as much).  My husband and I are pretty big Wiggles fans too so we don't mind watching the DVD's along with our son - plus it can be good aerobic exercise too!  :-)",1168300800,,500,4.02020202020202
