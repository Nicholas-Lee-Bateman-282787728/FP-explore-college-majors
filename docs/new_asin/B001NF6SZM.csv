8326669,5,B001NF6SZM,"This episode, and the other two that are available (""Save Water, Save Money"" and ""Watch Your Green Grow"") are quite good. I watched all of Steve's shows when they were originally broadcast. I loved them then and I love these episodes now. My only complaint is that these three are the only ones available now. If the others were available, I'd buy them all.",1515715200,,357,4.59375
