Spoilers

1. RANDY SAVAGE, JAKE ROBERTS, RICKY STEAMBOAT, BRUTUS BEEFCAKE & JIM DUGGAN VS THE HONKY TONK MAN, HERCULES, DANNY DAVIS, RON BASS & HARLEY RACE-this was an excellent opening match with some of the best talent that the WWE has ever had. The match is fast paced and full of back and forth action. The Macho Mans team wins this one with Savage, Roberts and Steamboat remaining.

2. THE FABULOUS MOOLAH, ROCKIN ROBIN,VELVET MCINTYRE & THE JUMPING BOMB ANGELS VS SENSATIONAL SHERRI, THE GLAMOUR GIRLS, DONNA CHRISTIANELLO & DAWN MARIE-we follow that opening match with a womens elimination match and it is just as good. This is a fun match and shows what the women are capable of. Great action that leads to a team Moolah win.

3. THE HART FOUNDATION, THE ISLANDERS, DEMOLITION, THE BOLSHEVIKS & THE DREAM TEAM VS STRIKE FORCE, THE YOUNG STALLIANS, THE FABOLOUS ROUGEAUS, THE KILLER BEES & THE BRITISH BULLDOGS-one of my favorite matches, I love the concept here with the teams of teams. Great match full of great talent. The longest match on the card I believe but it does not feel long. Back and forth action that sees Strike Forces team take home the victory.

4. HULK HOGAN, PAUL ORNDORFF, DON MURACO, KEN PATERA & BAM BAM BIGELOW VS ANDRE THE GIANT, ONE MAN GANG, KING KONG BUNDY, BUTCH REED & RICK RUDE-the main event of the evening and certainly one of the most hyped as Hogan and Andre would face off once again after Wrestlemania 3. This was a great main event and a great way to end the event. All of these competitors did a great job but as you know it was a standout performance for Bam Bam Bigelow. Andres team would go on to win but it was a fun way to end the show.

The first Survivor Series event was and still is one of the best events that the WWE has had. I miss this being the Thanksgiving Day tradition. This event was full of great talent and great action with very competitive matches.",1465171200,,1937,4.488636363636363
7809053,5,6300278646,"This event right here is a rare instance in which every single match was either good, great, or even excellent! The concept of a pay-per-view with nothing but elimination tag matches was definitely something original at the time this event took place but it proved to be one of the most exciting concepts in WWF/E history. The rules for each match was that a team of 5 would take on another team of 5 and wrestlers could be eliminated by either pinfall, submission, countout, or disqualification and the match will continue until all of a team has been eliminated which would result in the victory of the team who still has wrestlers that haven't been eliminated. Before Survivor Series began straying from its original format by filling the cards up with regular 1-on-1 matches, Survivor Series was truly an event that delivered the goods in its first few years. It's a shame that Survivor Series has never been this good again but for all WWF/E fans past or present i STRONGLY reccomend you to purchase a copy of this classic event. Here's my match-by-match review:

5-on-5 Survivor Series Elimination Tag Match
1. Randy Savage [RIP], Ricky Steamboat, Jake Roberts, Brutus Beefcake, and Hacksaw Jim Duggan VS. The Honky Tonk Man, Hercules Hernandez, Ron Bass, Harley Race, and Danny Davis
This was a fantastic opening match!!!! All 10 of these men put on fantastic performances and this match was filled with excitement and action galore! This is everything that a good Survivor Series match is all about. Savage's team wins when The Honky Tonk Man exits the ring and refuses to return which resulted in a countout. ****1/2

5-on-5 Survivor Series Elimination Tag Match
2. Sensational Sherri [RIP], Leilani Kai, Judy Martin, Donna Christanello, and Dawn Marie VS. The Fabolous Moolah [RIP], Rockin Robin, Velvet Mcintyre, and The Jumping Bomb Angels
WHO KNEW THAT A WWF WOMEN'S MATCH HAD THE POTENTIAL TO BE THIS EXCITING?? In what has got to be the greatest WWF women's match that i have ever seen in my life, These girls put on performances that would put all of the WWE ''divas'' [and even most of today's male wrestlers that currently wrestle in WWE] to utter shame. This match was simply astonishing for a women's match and all of the women in this match gave it their all [Especially The Jumping Bomb Angels]. In what i believe was actually the best match of this show, The women certainly stole the show here! Moolah's team won. ***** [Best match of the event]

20 Man Survivor Series Elimination Tag Match
3. The Hart Foundation, Demolition, The Dream Team, The Islanders, and The Bolsheviks VS. The British Bulldogs, The Young Stallions, The Rougeau Brothers, and Strike Force
In what has only been done twice at Survivor Series [The other time being at Survivor Series 88], 2 teams of 10 squared off against each other in a gigantic Survivor Series match. Due to the amount of wrestlers involved, This match is quite lengthy but it's still a very fun match nonetheless that thankfully doesn't get boring. The rules for this match was that if one member of a tag team is eliminated then that would eliminate both members of that wrestler's tag team. If you stick with it until the end, you'll see that this match is pretty good. ****

5-on-5 Survivor Series Elimination Tag Match
4. Hulk Hogan, Paul Orndorff, Don Muraco, Ken Patera, and Bam Bam Bigelow [RIP] VS. Andre The Giant [RIP], Rick Rude [RIP], King Kong Bundy, Butch Reed, and One Man Gang
A great main event and an awesome way to end this event, This match was essentially put together to continue the feud between Hogan and Andre. All throughout this match there was plenty of excitement and there was also an unexpected turn of events when Hulk Hogan was actually eliminated by countout which lead to Bam Bam Bigelow being the last survivor of Hogan's team! Trust me, If you like any of the men in this match you owe it to yourself to see this classic match but if you're a fan of the late Bam Bam Bigelow, Then this match carries a particular significance as it is one of his finest performances that he ever gave in his career. This match right here really showed why Bam Bam was one of the greatest big men to ever grace the ring. Despite the memorable effort by Bam Bam, He was unable to eliminate Andre and it would be the cause of Hogan's team being defeated by Andre's team. *****

This is not only still the greatest Survivor Series event ever assembled this is also the best WWF pay-per-view of the 80's! This event proves that sometimes less is really more as we only got 4 matches in this show but yet this little 4 match card of all elimination tag matches is better than many of the other WWF/E pay-per-views throughout the years that were filled from top to bottom with matches. Even if you're not familiar with this era of wrestling, You should still try to buy this event. NOTE: Avoid the original coliseum video release of this event as every single match is shortened except for the main event. Instead, Go buy volume 1 of the Survivor Series Anthology DVD box set to see this show unedited and uncut.",1315180800,2,5093,4.667037861915367
7809054,5,6300278646,"Before I begin, I must advice those that may be thinking in purchasing this VHS tape. You are better off getting the Survivor Series Anthology Volume I since this Coliseum Video was heavily edited down to the point that the only match that is shown in it's entirety is the main event so this is a review based off the recorded version of the show that I own to this day. Now with that being said, this was a historic night for so many reasons as this was the first ever Survivor Series that aired on Thanksgiving Day along with NWA's Starrcade '87 that aired on the same exact day that caused Starrcade to be removed off several cable companies in favor of this event. Now during this time, the Survivor Series was focused on the traditional Survivor Series Elimination matches with the hype surrounding the card being that this was going to be the first time since WrestleMania III that Hulk Hogan & Andre The Giant will be in the same ring for a match.

Randy Savage, Ricky Steamboat, Jake Roberts, Brutus Beefcake & Hacksaw Jim Duggan vs Honky Tonk Man, Harley Race, Ron Bass, Danny Davis & Hercules. Before I begin, a bit of irony here is that Savage & Steamboat had feuded prior to this while Savage would go on to feud with everyone else on his time in the upcoming years. This match got the show rolling in a big way as this was just fast paced action from bell to bell while pushing current feuds during that time such as Duggan & Race over the title of ""King"" along with Savage's feud with the Honky Tonk Man to the point where ""karma"" played a factor in the end for one of these men.

The Fabulous Moolah, Rockin Robin, Velvet McIntrye & The Jumping Bomb Angels vs Sensational Sherri, The Glamour Girls, Donna Christanello & Dawn Marie. This was during the time that the women's division had a heavy focus on wrestling more than anything else & that is exactly what you got here as this match was also given enough time to tell a story instead of coming off as a non-quality filler but the real highlight of this match was the performances of the Jumping Bomb Angels as they really brought a different style wasn't seen during this time in women wrestling.

Strike Force (Tito Santana & Rick Martel), The Young Stallions (Paul Roma & Jim Powers), The Rougeaus (Jacques & Raymond), The Killer Bees (Jim Brunzell & Brian Blair) & The British Bulldogs (Davey Boy & Dynamite Kid) vs The Hart Foundation (Bret Hart & Jim Neidhart), Demolition (Ax & Smash), The Islanders (Haku & Tama), The Bolsheviks (Nikolai Volkoff & Boriz Zhukov) & The New Dream Team (Greg Valentine & Dino Bravo). First of all, WOW this is a match that will never happen in today's standard of wrestling as there were so many well established teams, each being different than the other. This was perhaps the showstealer as this match went around 40 mins & was just classic tag team quality with certain moments such as Bret Hart getting even with Strike Force, the performances of the Islanders & the creative finish that even had Jesse Ventura (being the heel announcer that he is) shooting on that finish.

Hulk Hogan, Bam Bam Bigelow, Paul Orndorff, Don Muraco & Ken Patera vs Andre The Giant, King Kong Bundy, One Man Gang, Rick Rude & Butch Reed. This was the match that had the most hype of the night as it was centered around the fact that Hogan & Andre at some point would clash in the middle of the ring. Just like the previous matches on the card, this was a classic elimination style match that had tons of action right from the opening with moments such as Rude suffering from the lack of power of the other men, the Hogan/Andre confrontation that had the fans go wild for including a surprise outcome to it but more importantly the awesome performance of Bam Bam Bigelow in the end that just shows why he is still considered to be one of the best ""big men"" wrestlers in the business.

Overall for this being the first ever Survivor Series card, this was classic material as there wasn't a bad match on the card, each match was able to go on for a longer period of time instead of being a filler & pushed various storylines that WWF was pushing at the time (Hogan/Andre, Savage/Honky, Hart Foundation/Strike Force) so this is an event worth going out of your way to check out but once again I warn you, to check this event out in its entirety, I would recommend the Survivor Series Anthology.",1305158400,,4381,4.484962406015038
7809055,5,6300278646,"WWF'S Survivor Series was created to keep the feud of Andre and Hogan. It's probably my favorite concept they created but I do notice alot of cheap count outs on the first ten years of the event (87-97). It's Thanksgiving, so I decided to watch the first one.

Randy Savage, Rick Steamboat, Hacksaw Duggan, Brutus Beefcake, & Jake Roberts VS Honky Tonk, Harley Race, Hercules, Danny Davis, & Ron Bass: Beefcake ( because he is a friend of Hogan), Savage, Steamboat, and Roberts were the top four contenders for the intercontinental title. Steamboat would leave the WWF very soon. I enjoyed this match even those as I first paragraph, the end saw a cheap count out. However, it was Honky's gimmick so I guess it made sense. A fun little match.

The Fabulous Moolah, Velvet McIntyre, Rockin Robin, & Jumping Bomb Angels VS WWF Women's Champion Sensational Sherri, WWF Women's Tag Team Champions Lelani Kai & Judy Martin, Dawn Marie, and Donna Christianello: I heard it was a good match but I skipped over it.

British Bulldogs, Strike Force, Killer Bees, the Rougeaus, & the Young Stallions VS Hart Foundation, Bolsheviks, the Dream Team, the Islanders, & Demolition: I've said it once and i'll always say it- it's amazing how much talent had back in the 80's. The ring looked crowded with so many wrestlers on the outside but it was very enjoyable. Anther very good match.

A Million Dollar Man promo. Very good promo, showcasing what people will do for money. It's a shame WWF never game him a legit world title run.

Honky Tonk Man comes back out saying he was the sole survivor and challenges Hogan to a match. He says no one could beat him. I don't really care too much for Honky but I enjoyed this interview.

King Kong Bundy, Rick Rude, Andre The Giant, One Man Gang, and Butch Reed VS Hulk Hogan, Bam Bam Bigelow, Ken Patera (why?), Paul Orndorff, and the original Rock, Don Muraco: What a main event this looks to be even if Patera is in this one. Bigelow was the mvp of the match, surprising Andre won this one.

Overall, very good PPV and worth checking out.",1290643200,,2067,4.600543478260869
7809056,5,6300278646,"The Team Randy Savage-Team Honky Tonk man bout was a good/solid tag match. The 10 diva tag team elimination match was the showstealer of this event. The Team Strike Force-Team Hart Foundation match was a hard-hitting/solid tag team bout even with the cartoony ending. The Team Andre The Giant-Team Hulk Hogan main event was hard-hitting,nail-biting,heart-stopping & epic bout even though Hogan's team lost. I give this PPV a 9 out of 10.",1279497600,,437,5.083333333333333
7809057,2,6300278646,"Who would have thought that the original Survivor Series concept would end up being on the most anticipated events every year.  However, I would wait until WWE decided to release this event as part of a Anthology because the VHS tape is very lacking.  WWF heavily edited the VHS tape & every single match is edited except the main event and that recently became available on the 2006 Survivor Series DVD.

For those interested...here are the elimination matches on the tape but remember, they all are edited except the main event.

Andre the Giant, ""Ravishing"" Rick Rude, King Kong Bundy, ""The Natural"" Butch Reed, & The One Man Gang defeated WWF Champion Hulk Hogan, ""Mr. Wonderful"" Paul Orndorff, Bam Bam Bigelow, Don ""The Rock"" Muraco, & Ken Patera - The match was teased as the first Hogan/Andre confrontation since WrestleMania III and it did a good job of leaving the people wanting more but not feeling ripped off. This was classic WWF (not WWE, but World Wrestling FEDERATION) and really showcased how Bam Bam Bigelow was one of the best ""big men"" wrestlers in the history of the business.

7809058,5,6300278646,"From Richfield, Ohio, the first edition of this long-running annual event is a blast to watch.  Unfortunately, the choppy editing to trim the running time down to two hours is the one drawback.

1. Randy Savage w/ Miss Elizabeth, Rick Steamboat, Hacksaw Duggan, Brutus Beefcake, & Jake Roberts vs. I-C Champion Honky Tonk Man w/ Jimmy Hart, Harley Race, Hercules, Danny Davis, & Ron Bass:
This is a really fun match! Savage's team routs the Honky Tonk squad.  The match's only drawback is yet another cheap finish to save the cowardly Honky from losing by pin to any top challenger.  A fiery Savage's newfound popularity was also blooming at this time to rival that of Hulk Hogan.
4 1/2 **** (I would give it 5 if not for the ending)

2. Jumping Bomb Angels, Rockin' Robin, Fabulous Moolah, & Velvet McIntyre vs. the WWF Women's Tag Team Champs Glamour Girls w/ Jimmy Hart, WWF Women's Champion Sherri Martel, plus two unknowns:
The agile Bomb Angels and Velvet McIntyre appear far more talented than the others participating in this match.  The Bomb Angels stun the WWF Women's Champs to snare the win.  Jimmy Hart throws in a fun pratfall at the end.
4 1/2 **** (For a sequel, check out the Bomb Angels vs. the Glamour Girls at the 1988 Royal Rumble!)

3. British Bulldogs, WWF Tag Team Champs Strike Force, Killer Bees, the Rougeaus, & the Young Stallions vs. Hart Foundation w/ Jimmy Hart, the Bolsheviks w/ Slick, the Dream Team w/ ""Luscious"" Johnny V, the Islanders w/ Bobby Heenan, & Demolition w/ Mr. Fuji:
A superb match!!!  The only miscue is some poor editing.  For example, the Bulldogs are eliminated midway through the match, but you don't see how, as they are there one moment and then gone the next.  In a surprise ending, the Bees and the Stallions survive, while Bobby Heenan's Islanders team is impressive in the match's final minutes.
5 ***** (The final teams prove a welcome surprise!)

4. WWF World Champ Hulk Hogan, Don Muraco, Paul Orndorff, Ken Patera, & Bam Bam Bigelow vs. Andre, King Kong Bundy, One Man Gang, Rick Rude, & Butch Reed:
A perfect ending is the shocking main event where Hogan and friends initially appear to have the match well in hand, but then they start dropping one at a time.  Only Bigelow is left to face the three largest members of the other team.  Bigelow is the MVP of the match and arguably the event itself.
5 ***** (an added bonus for the unexpected outcome)

Overall, despite all the obvious editing, it's a superb effort from the WWF!  It leaves you wanting more instead of less, as a fifth Survivor elimination match for this event would have been welcome.",1095724800,4,2615,4.6521739130434785
7809059,5,6300278646,"Survivor Series 1987 was the first ever yearly pay-per-view besides WrestleMania which had started two years earlier. Survivor Series only came about due to the huge success of WrestleMania III. The event was advertized solely on the main event which was to be another chapter in the Hogan/Andre feud. Fans at the time were clamoring for more of this feud and Survivor Series made pretty good ratings off of that fact alone. Now, the event may have been advertised on it's main event, but that was almost the least entertaining match of the night. The Randy Savage team vs. Honky Tonk man team was the second best match of the night with the main event and the ladies elimination match tying at number three. By far the best and most entertaining match of not just that Survivor Series, but of any Survivor Series to come, was the 5 tag teams team vs. 5 tag teams team. Yes, that's five tag teams on each team equalling a total of twenty guys grouped in ten tag teams which were split into two teams of five tag teams, it worked like a typical tag match once one member of a tag team was eliminated he and his partner were eliminated, it's like the idea of the normal five on five except instead of five guys on five guys it's five tag teams on five tag teams, but in a sense each team stands alone because once one member of that tag team is eliminated so is his partner which makes it impossibly to see something like 17 guys against 11. This match by far showcased the best in the WWF tag teams of the time and it featured some of the biggest including Strike Force, the Killer Bees, Hart Foundation, Demolition to name a few. This event is really a great one to watch, the only problem I have with the version of this tape I currently own is it is, like many WWF tapes of that time, heavily editied which I frankly can't stand, but still a five star tape in my mind the best Survivor Series I've ever seen.",1073347200,3,1910,4.337988826815643
