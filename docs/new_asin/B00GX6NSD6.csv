8628310,4,B00GX6NSD6,"This concert-cum-reading was filmed in Rome in July 2003, twenty years after Suzanne Vega first signed a recording contract with A&M and corresponding with the release of what would be her final recording with that label.  Perhaps in a retrospective mood, this DVD is a mix of performances of some of her greatest hits interspersed with readings from Vega's ""The Passionate Eye"" (1999), and her simply talking about the origins of a few of those songs.  Italian singer-songwriter Valerio Piccolo, a friend, sits to the side on a stool, translating the readings and Vega's commentary into Italian.  I suppose this could be annoying but it really is much less intrusive than other have suggested.

The ""special features"" include an interview with Suzanne Vega, again by Valerio Piccolo, in which she discusses the process of  songwriting, the purpose and impact of music, and her approach to performance.  She is both thoughtful and articulate.

It's all rather cool, much like Vega's performance style.  The video is shot and edited in a straight-forward fashion, probably taped in NTSC (the image sometimes is a bit soft) but has been released in stereo and so it can be played in multiple television format .  This DVD is probably a must for serious fans and for anyone interested in Vega's ""process"", or those seriously interested in the creative process of songwriting.",1404259200,3,1372,5.062222222222222
8628311,4,B00GX6NSD6,"As I post there are already two reviews of this DVD with differing opinions. I hope I can flesh out some additional info to guide you.

This DVD ( being distributed by Music Video Distributors) features a full 62 minute concert by Vega recorded  probably for Italian TV  in July 2003 in Rome. Vega plays the guitar and is accompanied by her bassist.  In addition to being a singer-songwriter, Vega is a poet (there was a book published in 2001 of her collected works) and the purpose of this concert was to present half of it as her songs and half of her poems. Because (I guess) she felt her songs were more musically universal, she performs them as is. But the short poems she reads in English are then translated by Italian singer-songwriter Valerio Piccolo. All her hits are here and the sound and image are great.

There are two Special Features on the DVD: First is a nine-minute conversation/interview that Vega has (in English) with Piccolo over coffee in a caf. This will appeal to Vega fans. Then comes a three-minute photo gallery slide show which plays to one of Vegas songs.

This can be an intro to those who have never seen her live but be aware that about 1/3 of the running time is for the spoken word section.  For those who are already big Vega fans  and know her writings  this will be something they will want to own.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

8628312,4,B00GX6NSD6,"For those they may have reading comprehension issues, this was a combination poetry reading / concert done in Rome. Since Suzanne speaks in English there are a few points in the video where there are translations for the Italian audience. There are four short ""poetry readings"" during the show with subsequent translations to Italian. The song selection is great. This apparently is not a ""major label"" release and appears to be sourced from a recording made by an Italian company.",1401580800,3,481,5.025
8628313,1,B00GX6NSD6,"If you like hearing Suzanne tell stories and read poetry and then hear her bed mate say the same thing in another language then this is the DVD for YOU.
It is like watching ""Suzanne Entertains at the UN""",1400544000,5,203,4.230769230769231
