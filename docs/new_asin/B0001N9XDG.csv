8015007,5,B0001N9XDG,"This is SUCH a strange film - and that's all the more reason why I would recommend it. It's basically about a couple of spoiled college-aged guys at the beach for summer vacation who meet up with a mysterious, sexy woman (played by American actress Amadee Chabot, who does her only nude scenes in this movie - WOWser), who changes both their lives forever...sound familiar?

There are a lot of differences, too, from ""Y Tu..."", mainly in that there is a mystical/hallucinogenic aspect to Narda (the character Chabot plays), with a weird, kind of/actually/somewhat racist voodoo underpinning. But it's the overall tone of the film that reminded me of Cuaron's film, especially the rather bleak, nihilistic ending.

Also, it's got a really groovy late '60s look to it, with cool fashions, neat architecture and vroomin' cars.",1311638400,,823,5.044117647058823
