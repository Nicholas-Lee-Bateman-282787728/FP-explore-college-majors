8676343,5,B00N59JOBE,"I watched In a Stranger's Hand before Shakma on Christmas eve and enjoyed it.  I remember when I first watched this on Lifetime and Shakma on either Showtime, HBO, or Cinamax after I graduated from highschool.  This was the first movie that I became familiar with Brett Cullen and this was Prehysteria, Apollo 13,  Plus, I like watching Megan Gallagher and others too.",1514332800,,368,4.809523809523809
