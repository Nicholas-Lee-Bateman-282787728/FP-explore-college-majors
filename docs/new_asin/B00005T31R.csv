7953509,1,B00005T31R,"This is a comment about this version of Jet Li's Dr. Wai, issued by ""MEI AH"", and not a review of the movie itself. Because despite more than a dozen tries on two different computers I was unable to get the English subtitles to appear. And as I neither speak Mandarin or Cantonese, I had no idea what the movie was all about. I therefore threw it out.

And here is an additional comment: There is another DVD, also issued by ""MEI AH"", this time of Jet Li's ""Hitman"", which although it plays well, cannot be advanced or backtracked scene by scene, only from chapter to chapter.

Conclusion: As I never had problems like these with DVDs issued by other companies, I will make sure not to buy any DVDs issued by ""MEI AH"" in the future!",1346630400,,732,4.335766423357664

he's a Chinese professor that is looking for a scripture with no words because it predicts future and stuf. and the Japs are looking for it too. the timeline is when China was gettin invaded by Japan or been invaded.
Cousin Yee plays a Japanese Officer trying to lure Jet Li, they fall in love( like other movies) then...",1010620800,2,475,4.471264367816092
