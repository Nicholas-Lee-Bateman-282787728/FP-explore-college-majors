8473485,4,B005HQBOMU,"VCI has released the rare US release version of the film on DVD!!!  As most know, this low-budget Spanish-language Mexican film was acquired for US release by Stigwood/Carr in the 1970's, dubbed into English, edited down, re-scored, narration added, and released to US theaters by Paramount Pictures in 1976 to terrific boxoffice.  United Artists was planning their own big-budget film of the book ""ALIVE"" at that time, but this small Mexican film beat them to the punch and that film was scrapped.

Anyway, the original uncut Spanish-language version of the film - called ""SUPERVIVIENTES DE LOS ANDES"" - became available some years ago on DVD by a company called Urban Vision - and I reviewed that DVD a long time ago here.  It was great to finally get the film in some form on DVD back then, but a lot of us still craved the edited US version with all the different music, English dubbing, narration, etc. - the version we saw in theaters from Paramount back in 1976 - and that was never even released on VHS in the US.  For such a successful boxoffice  release, it seemed odd that Paramount never released the film on homevideo themselves - thus, possibly implying some sort of ""theatrical rights only"" legal issue and that Paramount could never release the US version on video.

Well, whatever is the case, VCI has somehow rescued the US version and released it on DVD!!!  It looks great and is just as you remembered it from US theaters.  I never thought the US cut would be seen again, but it's here on this DVD and that's all that counts.

Complaints have been made, and they are totally valid, that the ""Bonus"" uncut Mexican version of the film on VCI's disc does not include any English subtitles, even though the back of the DVD case says that it does.  Yep, the uncut Mexican version is also included here, but with NO English subtitles.  Oh my.  That's a bad mistake, but if you really want that uncut version with English subtitles, that cheap Urban Vision DVD from 10 years ago is still available for like $5 last time I checked.  So get that one, too, and then you'll have both versions.  :-)  All said, if you really want the US version of ""SURVIVE!"", this VCI disc is what you are after!

And to quote the overly exploitative US 1-sheet poster from Paramount Pictures: ""CAUTION!  The re-creation of the 1972 Andes plane crash and THE SURVIVAL SCENES may be too intense for young teenagers!""  Plus, on the poster there's the image of a naked dead body being dragged through the snow by one of the survivors.  Talk about classy marketing!!! ;)  RATED R.",1391817600,4,2568,4.612334801762114
8473486,4,B005HQBOMU,"I've been looking for this movie on dvd for many years (the American version) and finally found it.  Although less than stellar production values, gripping story, well-told.",1368403200,,173,5.407407407407407
8473487,2,B005HQBOMU,"15 years before the American A-movie hit ""Alive"", low-budget Mexican exploitation extraordinaire Ren Cardona made his own B-movie version of the true story of survival of the rugby team that crashed landed in the Andes that had to resort to cannibalism to survive. I've always been far more of a fan of the B-movie exploitation side of cinema and for years wanted to see this lost 'classic' to see how it compared to it's big budget American counter-part. When news that VCI was going to release the film I became excited, even more so since the DVD release was going to contain both the 86 minute American cut of the film as well as the uncut 112 Mexican Version of the film. I've been burned by VCI before (with their defective DVD release Spaghetti Western Double Feature Vol 2: Bullet for Sandoval / Any Gun Can Play]]) and I'm afraid to say again that we are 'graced' with yet another defective release.

The back of the DVD box artwork states that it also includes the original uncut Mexican version in 'Spanish Language with optional English subtitles.' This my friends is false. Sure it contains the uncut Mexican version... but with NO SUBTITLES! Ironically the shorter English dubbed version does but NOT the uncut Spanish language version. So unless you speak Spanish then you're out of luck with the uncut version.

For me the DVD is worth keeping since it still contains the cut American release but this is a real major flub by VCI. A lot of fans of the film were excited for the uncut version but without English subtitles then it's pointless. Shame on you VCI! I will definitely question ever buying one of your DVDs again with out thoroughly researching before hand.",1323388800,16,1683,4.7016949152542376
