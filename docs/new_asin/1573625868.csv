7798336,4,1573625868,"the movies in this collection are:

1.cyborg 2

2.death machine

3.evolver

4.solar crisis

of the four solar crisis ever made it to the movie house(where the real crisis was how quickly it vanished)and while not the greatest of movies it is fun and the best of this set.the other three movies are also ok(all went to video first)! the movies arn't bad but the set is a little pricey if you ask me.",1146182400,5,398,4.397260273972603
7798337,5,1573625868,"Of all the movies I have to say that Solar Crisis has an all star cast with Charlton Heston and a lot of other name actors for this semi low budget movie.  It's too bad it wasn't more popular. It's one of those sci fi movies that doesn't have a mega budget but is still fun to watch. The rest, Death Machine and the others are all sci fi channel quickie movies that all deserve a look. If I remember one of them has a pre lip enhanced Angelina Joline in one of them.",1138406400,5,466,3.9574468085106385
7798338,3,1573625868,"4 Nice solid classic SciFi movies and at a surprisingly reasonable price!  All without doubt fairly B grade stuff, but good fun nevertheless.  I'd recommend watching these all in one sitting with a good group of friends  and a stack of junk food.  Good fun way to blow an evening and enjoy the  great quotables.
Of the four, my fav would have to be Death Machine - go  those snapping jaws of death!",960595200,6,398,4.383561643835616
