5312232,1,B009B0SUF2,Poor connection and I would like my money back. Wasnt what I I was expecting at all. Ghost hunters isn't what i wanted to watch,1354665600,,127,4.12
5312233,5,B009B0SUF2,I caught a Halloween viewing of the Shining Secrets of the Stanley Hotel and it was riveting.  I am a huge buff of the the paranormal but I also have a rather large skeptic streak so the quality of the investigation is an important key in keeping my interest.  The documentary presented a well rounded investigation that not only detailed the history of the hotel and the background information surrounding the different paranormal phenomena but they also tried to debunk them in a plausible way.  I also enjoyed the fact that the team members all bring different view points and experience to the table.  They have definitely gained a fan and I am looking forward to more documentaries from them.,1352332800,2,697,4.783333333333333
5312234,5,B009B0SUF2,"I really enjoyed this film. I've seen ""The Shining"" many times, and was always in love with this hotel. It was really cool to get a ""behind the scenes"" tour of the property. It's as beautiful as I thought! This group did a great job showing the history of the place with the paranormal elements. I know that stuff doesn't happen as often as it does on tv, but it seems like they caught some pretty cool evidence on film! I'm looking forward to watching their other films and can't wait to see what these folks do next!",1352332800,,518,4.295918367346939
5312235,5,B009B0SUF2,This documentary is the real paranormal and nothing like you see on TV reality. Very well written and directed. It will open your eyes to what paranormal research is all about. Excellent work well done. We need more people to film like this giving a historical and paranormal view.,1352332800,,281,4.755102040816326
5312236,5,B009B0SUF2,"I love the Shining, and have always been curious about the Stanley (where Stephen King stayed when he came up with the idea).  This is an excellent behind the scenes look at the haunted aspects of this hotel that inspired the book and movie.  You will find out who died where - and how.  Then you get to see some very interesting phenomena this group caught on tape while they were hanging out in haunted hotel rooms.  And you can see it all from the comfort of your own unhaunted living room, which is definitely my preference. They don't cram conclusions down your throat or try too hard to make it spooky, like some other ghost shows I have seen.  This video is not hokey at all.  They are serious about it, and they put it out there for you to decide.  I liked that aspect of it.  Good documentary.",1351728000,3,802,4.3
5312237,1,B009B0SUF2,OMG this movie was so boring it made me envy the dead! I felt like I was in high-school all over again!,1351555200,,103,3.727272727272727
5312238,5,B009B0SUF2,"This documentary truely captures the paranormal history of The Stanley Hotel.  This is a real look at the hotel that inspired Stephen King to write ""The Shining"", without any spin from a reality show producer.  I found this documentary to have a perfect blend of history of the hotel, paranormal experiences from guests & staff and unexplainable events captured on film during a true paranormal investigation.  The hour goes by quickly while watching this film.  If you can not make it out to The Stanley Hotel (where this documentary is also sold in their gift shop) for a stay or tour, this documentary is the next best thing!",1348358400,8,628,4.787037037037037
5312239,3,B009B0SUF2,This video was relatively interesting.,1449100800,,38,6.8
5312240,1,B009B0SUF2,You are better off watching the Ghost Hunters episodes of their investigations of the Stanley Hotel.  They are MUCH better.,1448841600,,123,5.15
5312241,4,B009B0SUF2,"As I have stated before, I love documentaries.  I am addicted to watching them.  I love the Stanley Hotel and was excited to see this documentary.  However, it really is not much of a documentary.  There are no secrets to discover.  It is a hockey ghost hunting escapade.  It put me to sleep.",1444521600,,292,4.415094339622642
5312242,1,B009B0SUF2,"If you're looking for a more historical perspective of the Stanley Hotel, DON'T get this video.  It's basically a cheesy ghost hunter video.  Definitely not worth the money.",1439164800,,173,5.142857142857143
5312243,1,B009B0SUF2,Ho hum. A waste of time and money.,1433721600,,34,3.375
5312244,1,B009B0SUF2,If u want to have a tour of the hotel.... This is ok.... Paradumber....like to see Ghost Adventures investigation,1432857600,,113,5.0
5312245,1,B009B0SUF2,"I expected a professional documentary and this was, instead, a very poorly executed ""home movie"". Regret paying my $3.00 to watch this.",1411084800,,135,5.181818181818182
5312246,1,B009B0SUF2,"The history was neat, but the ""ghost hunting"" was so stupid.  Why on earth did I have to pay $3.99 for this?  It was a complete waste of money.",1392595200,,143,3.896551724137931
5312247,2,B009B0SUF2,"A waste of the money spent to watch. Did not even interest me until the last 20 minutes. Looks like it might be good.. But an extremely first 3/4, poorly put together, Might watch for FREE but a NEVER PAY FOR SORT of movie.",1390780800,2,223,4.090909090909091
5312248,1,B009B0SUF2,"I guess I expected more footage would be revealed with the all the ghost hunting/paranormal equipment. But the footage sucked- showed very minimal, if ANYTHING, for paranormal activity. The stories were neat, but thats it. I live 1/2 hour from Estes Park and I would have had a better experience going by myself. Waste of money.",1376870400,3,328,4.875
5312249,1,B009B0SUF2,"The copy I  got must be defective.  Or, at least, I hope so.  The audio quality was so miserable that I gave up on it after a few minutes.  I looked at the Return Policy but decided it wasn't worth the hassle over a $10 or $15 (I forget the amount) purchase.  Maybe you'll be luckier.",1368921600,2,284,4.0
5312250,2,B009B0SUF2,The history of the hotel and the brief footage of the buildings and grounds were quite interesting. However the paranormal events and investigation didn't even reach the level of a bad joke.,1366416000,,190,4.96875
5312251,3,B009B0SUF2,"More than anything, it was cool to see the shots of the hotel. There are some great stories, a few cool experiences, but mainly this is a good doc for Shining/Kubrick fans.",1364428800,,172,4.40625
5312252,1,B009B0SUF2,"I was excited when I found this video and couldn't wait to watch it so when I got 30minutes into in and turned it off due to how boring it was i was sadly disappointed. If you want to watch or hear about the ghosts of the Stanley Hotel apparently you need to watch the episode on Ghost Hunters becasue all this video does, besides walking through poorly decorated hotel rooms, is point out everything that happened on the episode of ghost hunters. Read the books about the history of the Stanley Hotel, much better than this docu.",1364083200,3,530,4.418367346938775
5312253,5,B009B0SUF2,"I love the Standoff Hotel and this video was great.  There was plenty of history of the hotel, with photos.  And best of all well done documenty on the hauntings at the Stanley.",1362441600,,177,4.333333333333333
5312254,1,B009B0SUF2,"I had hoped to see more than just a crew of people standing around waiting for something to happen. There were lots of close-ups of ""ghost hunting equipment"" doing nothing.  People talking to the air with no responses, recounting of being poked while trying to sleep - typical. In the last few seconds, a door slammed.  OK.  The historical facts as told by the hotel staff were interesting, but other than that, nothing new was brought to light by this documentary. It would have been nice if they had included a bit about Stephen King's stay, but  no. It wasn't scary or even fascinating, it was extremely dull and a total waste of money.  The ""Ghosthunters"" TV show version was much better than this.",1361145600,4,702,4.629032258064516
5312255,5,B009B0SUF2,Adventure Myths puts together a truly professional documentary insight into the paranormal activity at The Stanley Hotel.  It was an honor to be included in this project.  The Stanley Hotel has many stories to tell and the crew from Adventure Myths brings those right to your tv.  You won't be disappointed.,1358985600,2,307,4.980392156862745
5312256,4,B009B0SUF2,I found this quite enjoyable & not just because I run a hotel & like ghosts :-) Even seeing how this hotel was built....The mountain it's on is actually inside the hotel. Crazy but very interesting. Not one of the scariest shows I've seen but packed with info from people who seem very genuine as well as a bit of actual footage.,1357689600,,329,4.32258064516129
8539061,1,B009B0SUF2,I want my money back! I'm so disappointed! I really hoped it would make me want to stay in the hotel and I actually hoped it would describe more about the hotel's history. This is just another cheap extraterrestrial show that is a total rip-off! Stay in the Menger Hotel in San Antonio if you want a true historical hotel with REAL extraterrestrial experiences!,1503014400,,361,4.65625
8539062,5,B009B0SUF2,Awesome...as a fan of the shining movie I can see a close resemblance to the movie...and it kinda freaks me out with the similarities,1502755200,,133,4.583333333333333
8539063,5,B009B0SUF2,This is good to watch if you are planning a trip to the STANLEY HOTEL like i am and want to make a list of the rooms NOT to ask to stay in.,1486684800,,139,3.242424242424242
8539064,1,B009B0SUF2,"I wish I could give it less than 1 star.  Do not pay for this.  IF the historical information is correct, that would be the only redeeming quality.  I wish I had read the reviews before actually paying money to see this.",1483228800,,220,4.190476190476191
8539065,1,B009B0SUF2,Poorly produced junk.,1479081600,,21,6.333333333333333
8539066,1,B009B0SUF2,Not very well made. We watched it and all thought it could have been much better and more intresting.,1471824000,,101,4.368421052631579
8539067,3,B009B0SUF2,It was ok....,1466035200,,13,3.6666666666666665

8539069,2,B009B0SUF2,I don't believe in ghost so for me it was sort of like... ok whatever.,1462406400,,70,3.7333333333333334
8539070,1,B009B0SUF2,Thought it would be about the Stanley Hotel but instead it was about stupid ghost hunting.,1462147200,,90,4.6875
