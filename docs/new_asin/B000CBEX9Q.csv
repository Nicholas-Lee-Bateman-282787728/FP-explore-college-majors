8096618,5,B000CBEX9Q,"This DVD contains some great epidoes of the Roy Roger Show, which I grew up watching in reruns in the late 50's and early 60's. He was my hero back then, and as I grew older, came to know that he was a really good human being. Nice when your childhood heroes are also honest, upright, quality people in real life.

DVD has one of two issues were I think there were film problems when they duplicated them, but that's what happens when old film comes to DVD. All in all I am very happy I bought this (and three others) as they bring back some wonderful childhood memories, and the messages in the stories remind me again of how we really all ought to be living together, helping each other!",1380844800,3,689,4.259541984732825
