8268835,5,B00188KUSK,"A must-have for any Back to the Future fan of any age! :-) It is fun to watch and great addition to anyone's viewing collection. Also, family-friendly-- winning!",1484352000,,161,4.785714285714286
8268836,5,B00188KUSK,"I am a big fan of the entire Back To The Future franchise, and I was happy to see this item I remember from my childhood available for purchase! The shipment had arrived one day earlier than expected, which was terrific! The VHS was received in well-wrapped packaging, and came in very good condition. The front cover and one side panel was slightly faded probably due to both light exposure and time. Very little fraying of the cassette sleeve. The VHS tape itself appeared to be in great condition and played very well. As for the content, I very much enjoyed the episodes on this tape since it referenced much from the Back To The Future Trilogy, and the creative writing and science experiments by Bill Nye the Sciene Guy was appreciated as well! Overall, I was very pleased with this vintage product purchase! Thanks again!",1424304000,,828,4.678082191780822
8268837,5,B00188KUSK,How can one celebrate 30 glorious years of Back to the Future? By releasing the very rare animated series. I remember watching this show as a kid and I loved it! This show is great for every generation. Come on Back to the Future fans let us educate this generation by showing not only the trilogy but the show.,1415923200,,311,4.288135593220339
8268838,3,B00188KUSK,"I also hope this series is available soon on DVD. And, not bootlegged.
I've seen four episodes of this animated series on VHS. There're quite good.
It is now available on DVD.",1403827200,,175,4.5
8268839,5,B00188KUSK,"Future day: October 21, 2015. The day that Marty & Doc Brown reaches the future Hill Valley. It's roughly 16 months away. That is plenty of time to get the Animated Series to DVD/Blue Ray. Marketing guys love anniversary dates for re-releases and stuff, and this is a huge one that people have been waiting for 30 years. If Universal is smart, they will use this date as the gimmick to sell the animated series because people will remember at least that 2015 was the year they travelled back to, and most likely get the urge to at least see the movies again when they are reminded about them. So you'll have new and renewed interests from people browsing around for BTTF stuff... This sounds like an opportune time to me!

Let's go and get these episodes released. Anyone have a petition that needs signing?",1403740800,3,807,4.56551724137931
8268840,5,B00188KUSK,This series should have already been released on dvd I know there are many many fans who want this to happen most of all me come on someone please bring this to dvd so we fans can enjoy it all over again.,1300492800,6,204,3.880952380952381
8268841,5,B00188KUSK,"First of all...is this happening or not?! Take this off if there is not going to be a release. I spoke to someone at BTTF.com and they said there are no plans on releasing this on DVD or Blu-Ray because of the popularity. But yet I see alot of other series on DVD and wonder why. I have worked in a retail store that sold them and saw them just sit on the shelf and not sell. So they should give this a chance atleast. With enough people knowing that the Back to the Future Complete Animated Series has been released on DVD/Blu-Ray I know they can't lose.

I am one obviously waiting for this as well and have not been satisfied with buying the ones online from people that have tranferred them from their tv/vhs player to dvd. The quality doesn't even look like VHS. It is very pixelized with volume levels that aren't very clear or even through out the episodes. So again...Please hurry up and release this so people can be satisfied and not waste thier money on the bootlegs.",1299628800,3,978,4.344262295081967
8268842,5,B00188KUSK,Why is this not releasing close to the latest trilogy DVD?? Universal - you always drop the ball on this sort of thing. Stop dropping the ball!,1294358400,3,143,4.333333333333333
8268843,5,B00188KUSK,"Why is there no release date?
i loved the movie trilogy but i've never seen the animated series.
when will it come out?",1293235200,2,119,4.217391304347826
