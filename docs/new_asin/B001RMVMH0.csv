Awesome.",1475107200,,75,3.75
8338295,5,B001RMVMH0,"This is the video to get to learn slap bass. Another reviewer points out that this information can be found for free online- ""Expert Village""? Really? Sorry, I find few ""experts"" there...

There is a lot on youtube, but this is a great course with everything you need in one place. Everything is clearly explained and demonstrated. Moving from all of the free videos available you may miss some very important information- you can't find what you're looking for if you don't know what it is!

Private lessons with someone skilled in this art would be best, BUT if you intend to learn to slap on your own this is a valuable resource. Sure, augment this with youtube stuff and what ever, but don't pass this great video up!",1380412800,,721,4.5813953488372094
8338296,2,B001RMVMH0,"I have played electric bass for years and wanted to try my hand at Rockabilly slap bass. I bought this DVD because it was so highly recommended on upright bass websites.

It may have been great back in the era of VHS but everything taught on the DVD can now be found for free on the internet, youtube, expert village, etc.  It is in dire need of updating.

Instructionally, it is the equivalent of hanging out for 35 minutes with pro slap players with whom you cannot ask any questions. It basically just covers the slaps -single, double, triple  etc. but doesn't give much instruction on how to incorporate them together or moving from note to note or from string to string. Just a quick demonstration of the basic slaps and you are left to figure out the rest for yourself.

There is basically no mention of gear - pickups, amplification, left hand technique, transport, strings, etc.
There is nothing wrong with the information presented on the DVD - it just doesn't go far enough to get one started on the instrument.
They guys, Mark Ruben and Kevin Smith to seem friendly, willing to teach and are good instructors but the material is too thin.",1376438400,,1149,4.585365853658536
