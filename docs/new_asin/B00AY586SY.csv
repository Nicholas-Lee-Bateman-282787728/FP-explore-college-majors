5527279,3,B00AY586SY,"There has been a recent flux of found footage spoofs including this one from comedic actor Kevin Farley.  Although there are some funny bits, they come too far apart to maintain the laughs.  Satire IMO needs to be paced just right to be truly effective.  For instance, the silly seizures of demonic possession are funny the first two times but Farley just overdoes it.  Some of the cameos work well:  eric Roberts, William Katt, Kevin Sorbo, Jake Busey, Robert Hays and  Quintin Aranson.  The Jack Goff character isn't one iota funny--just excessively crude.
I haven't seen A HAUNTED HOUSE yet but I'm hoping the Wayans Brothers do it right!",1365552000,,641,4.825688073394495
5527280,5,B00AY586SY,"I lol'ed too many times to count.  Thought I was sick of the horror spoof films, but this was really, seriously funny.",1365465600,2,118,4.363636363636363
5527281,5,B00AY586SY,"Kevin Farley can be crude and down right dirty... but I love it! It takes a lot to lose a sibling, or any loved one for that matter, but it must be extremely difficult to lose a sibling who was in the public eye.  Imagine what he had to go through and what he had to overcome...?
It may have taken a few years for him to come back from his awesome pretend boy band show ""2gether,"" but I have nothing but faith in him to be great.  This is his first step in that direction and the movie is great! Highly suggest watching it!",1365465600,3,523,3.9714285714285715
5527282,4,B00AY586SY,"I mean it's illegal to design & construct a building without handicap access. This film has the common issue of frequent fluctuations in sound FROM EXTREMELY QUIET DIALOGUE (which expedites with humorous adult oriented one liners to keep the audience entertained) TO LOUD MOANING & MARIACHI MUSIC. I wouldn't mind the broad fluctuations in audio if i could follow along reading subtitles while keeping the sound at a constant level. Obviously my real problem is that i don't have a remote control for my surround system because I'm a BUM, but that's a different issue I believe. The 2nd half of the film has a fairly constant level to be fair. Subtitles Please.

The Movie itself. Seems pretty funny with surprising celebrity cameos from the likes of Jake Busey & Kevin Sorbo, etc. Kevin Farley is not his brother Chris and it's not fair to try and compare this film to what the project could've been had it been helmed by Chris Farley (though honestly i have imagined). I LOVE SPOOF films so I plan on purchasing this film but not at the current $20 equilibrium price. I rented it from the local video store for a few dollars ready for a comedy Thankfully not as serious as ""A HAUNTED HOUSE"" but certainly better than the obscure and mediocre ""SUPERNATURAL ACTIVITY""(I was impressed by the well scripted writing of the relatively unknown Lisa Baget). I've been a fan of the Farley Brothers (of course other than Chris) since I saw them in ""THE BREAKS"" well over a decade ago. I'm glad to see KEVIN FARLEY IS WORKING and DOING WELL! This picture is a worthy entry into the COVETED  ""... MOVIE""  parody franchise haha, which is probably an insult to most claimed self respecting directors. I was surprised not to see this DVD available at my local Walmart. Hopefully this Film receives a broad distribution! 4 stars cause of William Katt's crazyness nostalgiac of that uncle most of know whether through blood or marriage. TOM SIZEMORE... words can't describe.",1365465600,2,1959,4.772861356932153

8559021,1,B00AY586SY,"The late great Chris Farley's brother Kevin directs and stars in this ""Paranormal Activity"" parody. This move here has signified the real life fact that the comedic genius gene was only given to one of the brothers. I wondered if Kevin could do any better after i saw him in a horrid performance in ""F.A.R.T The Movie""? And the answer to that now is.... NOPE! He has not redeemed himself here with this slap stick comedy that has failed to produce more than a small chuckle out of me during the whole film.

The plot is the same thing as ""Paranormal Activity"", and this movie is about as funny as what ""Paranormal Activity"" was scary. It had some humerus ideas, but the delivery and acting of it where just not right. It's a shame, I was looking forward to this one, being that it was not made by those same losers who keep making the ""(insert word here) Movie"" films that have flooded the marked since ""Scary Movie""'s success and completely ruined mock films forever.

I strongly suggest you ignore the other reviews here. 6 reviews so far, 5 over 3 star ratings? They are either lying, part of the crew and making fake reviews, have a real hard on for Kevin Farley, or have just come out of being part of 'The Late Show With David Letterman's' audience and will clap and cheer at anything for some strange reason. There is no way anyone in their right mind would give this movie a perfect or near perfect rating. IMDB shows it so far as a 3 out of 10 rating with over 250 votes. Which one do you think is going to be more accurate here?

I watched this with a glimmer of hope that some body could help resurrect the parody genre in films, but I was only left disappointed. Not even the entourage of guest cameo roles made this movie worthy of being rated more than 1 star. No one seemed to put on an act that they can hold their heads up high and be proud they where part of this stinker.",1390089600,2,1890,4.303370786516854
