489069,3,6302610761,"This is a two edge sword, if you are buying it for the aircraft you won't be disappointed.
Lots of T-33s, F-86s and a wonderful sequence of intercepting a B-36 in an F-94 (something that would have required cooperation of the B-36 in real life)
If you love camp, you will also not be disappointed, but as a movie, it is pretty awful, but if you close your eyes until you hear engine noise, it isn't too bad",1055548800,3,406,4.217948717948718
489070,2,6302610761,"The flying scenes in this movie are wonderful.  The F-86 was an awsome plane and this movie has plenty of F-86 action.  But it barely makes up for the pathetic story line.  It's unbelievable and gets down right stupid, definitely NOT one of John Wayne's better movies.  I would recommend this movie only to those who really like watching '50's era planes, make sure you have your remote handy.",1051056000,3,393,4.6521739130434785
489071,5,6302610761,"I bought this video in late 1999, and it is still played and enjoyed in our home, at least once a week!
""Bob"" is a guy who shadows behind a Northwest Airlines pilot to see firsthand, what life is like in this type of career. I bought this for my daughters almost three years ago, when they were ages one and three, as their daddy is an airline pilot, himself.
I can't think of any other videos out there which explore a career as well as this one has!  In my opinion, ""Bob's Job"" is captivating for young and old, alike.
(Almost a year after buying this video...) I will never forget my two year old in my lap on board a flight, right after we'd settled into our seats...while looking out the window, she squealed with sheer delight, ""MOMMY, MOMMY, look!!!  It's the ""TARMAC, MAC!!!""  She was able to point out the engines, the cockpit, the flaps, and many other things I never realized she'd absorbed!
And ""Bob"" if you're ever reading this...EXCELLENT work!!!
I highly recommend this video!",1031097600,,991,4.4944444444444445
489072,4,6302610761,"This movie refuses to make any sense, but it is a ton of fun to watch. It should be part of any Cold War movie fan's collection (double feature suggestions: The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T, Dr. Strangelove). Hilariously sincere claptrap with wonderful production values.

The DVD itself surprised me: the quality of the one I got was excellent - great color, clear sound, nice widescreen version.",1001635200,4,391,4.835820895522388
489073,5,6302610761,"The F-86, IMHO, is the best looking airplane to ever leave the ground.  The flying scenes in this movie, of which there are many, with F-86s are fantastic.  Knowing that one of them is actually piloted by Chuck Yeager just adds to the enjoyment.  Howard Hughes produced this movie and his love of flying comes though loud and clear.
I never buy full-screen DVDs unless the movie is a must-have, as this one is, and it's specs showed it to be full-screen.  I was pleasantly supprised to find that it is actually widescreen (1.85:1), as clearly marked on the holder and label, so the wingtips of the F-86s don't get clipped off.
This is my kind of show.  I rate it 5 stars (as high as Amazon will allow!).",994982400,7,703,4.4186046511627906
489074,3,6302610761,"I just thought I'd mention that the shots of the F-86 Sabre flying was done at Edwards Air Force Base (then Muroc Air Base).  The Sabre was flown by none other the Chuck Yeager (yes, that Yeager, the one who broke the sound barrier).",990144000,5,233,4.295454545454546
489075,3,6302610761,"This is at times both a wonderful film, and then equally as bad as it is good. John Wayne plays his part to perfection, but this is still a fluke for the Duke (albeit an entertaining one).
First off, the direction is wonderful, as is the footage of old jets, the color, the cinematography, stunt piloting by none other than Chuck Yeager, and of course, John Wayne in his prime.
But there are also glaring errors and bizzare oversights that, if the film were one of the jets it depicts, would be given a direct hit with anti-aircraft fire.
It all starts when a Russian MIG jets in over an American airbase, and is forced down. The pilot turns out to be a woman (GASP!), defecting to the US. The Duke has to debrief her, so to speak. As she takes off her flight suit jets whoosh by to let us know that the Duke and all of the other airmen on the base are...well... for lack of a better term, ready for take-off.
The Pentagon thinks she's a spy, sent to swipe secret info. John Wayne is assigned to escort the pilot around the base and try to get the truth out of her.
The lady Commie is given free run of the airbase, to go where she wants and see what she wants. She even is allowed to pilot American fighters!
This is where the laughabillity comes in. Have you any idea just how much an enemy pilot can tell about a nation's strengths and weaknesses in air defense just by getting a quick LOOK at one of their jet aircraft!  And here this suspected spy gets to sashay her way into FLYING one!  SEVERAL times!  Talk about a lapse in security! Even in Hollywood, it would lead to a firing squad for the brass that okayed it.
I might have been able to buy into it (or at least overlook it), if Janet Leigh could have managed a Russian accent. In fact NONE of the Russians in the movie sound Russian. Not even Hollywood-Russian. The one general who tries comes off sounding like he speaks Italian!
It's no small wonder the film was put in a vault for seven years before being released. I suspect that a Russian-sounding voiceover for Leigh was planned, but became a forgotten detail over the years.
Still, the Duke looks great. The film could have been far worse (nowheres NEAR as bad as ""The Conquerer"", with the Duke as Ghengis Khan), and it is worth a looksee for the ariel photography and the old jets if nothing else. A word to the wise, however. This is not a serious film at all. It seems to be rather tongue-in-cheek, and that may be the best way to take it.",971654400,14,2462,4.278969957081545
489076,3,6302610761,"Jet Pilot is a good John Wayne film, co-starring Janet Leigh (Psycho) You can tell Wayne is comfortable in his role as Col. James Shannon. Leigh is as beautiful as ever as a Russian pilot, she and Wayne fall in love, but  later on General Black reveals shes a spy. Sounds like a good movie...  ...BUT, this DVD is jumpy, and has a pink circle pop up in the left corner  about every 15 seconds. It doenst supprise me though, Goodtimes home video  (who released this DVD) has never released a high quility movie. They are  recorded in LP mode and have a high pitched squeal in them.
I give this  movie 4/5 stars, but the DVD is a 3/5 If you want this movie I sugest you  buy the VHS it is also Goodtimes video, but it doesnt bother you as much.",961891200,12,742,4.146853146853147
489077,3,6302610761,"John Wayne is a tough-talking air force colonel who ends up falling in love with Soviet defector Janet Leigh, who has some secrets of her own.  The film is a nice mixture of action (with wonderful shots of the US Air  Force in action performing various flight maneuvers), romance, and comedy.  The dialogue is a little clunky at times, but still, it's a good, romantic  adventure that has two of America's favorite screen legends:  The Duke  & Ms. Leigh.
In a side note about this film, in her autobio,  ""There Really Was A Hollywood"", Ms. Leigh wrote that this film  was made in 1950. However, eccentric millionaire producer Howard Hughes  kept making changes to the film by tinkering with special effects and  miniatures, even having the actors refilm scenes two years later.  The  picture didn't get released until 1957.",958780800,9,823,4.841726618705036

My humble haiku assessment of John Wayne's ""Jet Pilot"".....

Very good flight scenes. *
Story is somewhat hokey. **
Commies, Yanks THAT dumb?!? ***

-----
* - Not surprising, given Howard Hughes made the flick, with the USAF getting third billing in the opening credits - no CGI in those days.

** - Meh - boy meets girl, boy defects with spy girl, spy girl defects back for steak?

But, if you love good acting and demand the movie has a plot, you can skip this one.

Janet Leigh does an excellent job of displaying her curvaceous wares, a la Howard Hughes. (His signature is all over this one)!",1168560000,4,425,4.435897435897436

489187,5,6302610761,"Other reviewers rightfully acknowledge the superb flying footage, including the launching from a B-29 bomb bay of the X-1 rocket plane destined to break the sound barrier, but I would like to point out that this film highlights a young and beautiful Janet Leigh (only 22 or so at the time the film was made) as no other from her early career -- the sexy energy she projects through her character manages to steal every scene! Though the plot is preposterous, the film is nevertheless most enjoyable. The beauty of the aerial ballet between the two protagonists as they play hide-and-seek among the clouds is cinematic love-making at its most subtle and slyly humorous -- so much so that it seems to have escaped the notice of other reviewers. To see the hero (Wayne) utterly nonplussed by the dynamic and self-assured heroine (Leigh) playing the archetypal socialist egalitarian wonder girl is pure pleasure! The closest thing in film to this cross-cultural romantic situation (at the height of the Cold War no less!) is the one depicted between Fred Astaire and Cyd Charisse in the later comic musical 'Silk Stockings.' Save for the recent forgettable 'thirties futurist serial-inspired flop with that Lara Croft actress, Hollywood has never produced a film with a woman military pilot as the heroine. For this it took Howard Hughes. In 1950 however one must suppose that it was necessary for cultural reasons to ignore the recent phenomenon of unsung American WAC pilots having ferried fighters and bombers from Canada to Great Britain (suffering losses along the way) by depicting the heroine (Leigh) as a passionately anti-capitalist Russion patriot who (naturally) falls for (or appears to fall for) the strong, silent American male archetype (Wayne). After fifty years this aviation romance is still loads of fun!",1105660800,5,1819,5.086956521739131

Dumb plot. Apparently the word ""sex""  hadn't been invented in 1950. It's Howard Hughes week & this is his movie. Great pilot & once again the shots of the F-86's  in the air are excellent. A great movie maker? Not.",1103068800,3,454,4.305882352941176
489189,3,6302610761,"As noted by others, the wonderful aerial scenes, including a sequence with actual flying footage of the Bell X-1, plus all the shots of Korean War-vintage aircraft, make this movie more than worthwhile for aviation buffs (especially knowing that Chuck Yeager participated in the flying). Most of this is original footage shot for 'Jet Pilot' -- with the cooperation of the USAF; no grainy stock shots, minimal fake process shots. If one can overcome the ludicrous story and dramatics, its jaw-dropping badness can become entertaining (consider the 'atomic-powered' fighter jets which can fly all over the northern hemisphere without refueling!).

Of interest to military buffs in this 1950 movie (having a delayed 1957 theatrical release) is the mix of brown and blue uniforms for Air Force personnel, the brown uniforms being a hold-over from AAF days. As an independent service the Air Force probably was less than three years old when 'Jet Pilot' was filmed.

For cinema/home theatre buffs, note that because 'Jet Pilot' was made in 1950, it was NOT filmed NOR framed for widescreen, so for its 1957 release it would have been illegitimately cropped at the top and bottom to achieve a widescreen effect during theatrical projection. The DVD letterbox bands simulate this effect, but the authentic video framing should be 1.33:1, which corresponds to the full 1.37:1 Academy frame used in production.

Paul Frees has an amazingly energetic bit part.
