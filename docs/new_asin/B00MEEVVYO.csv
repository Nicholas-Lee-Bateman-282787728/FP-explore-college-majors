6568335,4,B00MEEVVYO,"Rain was Awesome! I just wish he had more action in this film..He is the only reason why I was interested in seeing The Prince! It was  his first comeback performance since  his enlistment and discharged from his 2 year mandatory Military service in Korea. The fighting scene was all him and during  the rehearsal, Rain accidentally injured and cut the stunt guy's face  for  the Jason Patric's character. He was  quite apologetic and concern for the stunt man.. I will definitely buy the DVD  because of Rain's performance. The director wanted Rain to take part in his movie because he was impressed with his fighting skill and acting in his first  Hollywood starring  movie"" Ninja Assassin' which Rain won at the 2010 MTV  Movie Award for the biggest bad ass Star ! I highly recommended watching him in that role.",1409011200,2,815,4.716312056737588
6568336,5,B00MEEVVYO,"I just watched this On Demand and read some of these other reviews and yes it's true that I think everyone was expecting more Bruce Willis and John Cusack but I think Jason Patric really knocked it out of the park.  I didn't see the twists coming although when I started watching it a second time I now understand the purpose of the opening sequence.  I think it was shot beautifully but the script was the weakest link.  It had some pretty standard plot points, some cliche's, and some paint by numbers scripting but the Director kept the energy and pacing up in a very entertaining and stylized way. It keeps moving from one point to the next, kept my attention, and then when the action starts it just keeps going all the way through the end.

I'm honestly recommending it to everyone.  It's a damn solid piece of film and not at all what I was expecting. Great work!",1408924800,,870,4.4125
6568337,1,B00MEEVVYO,It really isn't worth 1 star. Dreadful!,1408838400,,39,4.714285714285714
6568338,3,B00MEEVVYO,"Not nearly as bad as you probably think. Nothing original about the plot but its actually a pretty entertaining, if a little generic, revenge film. Movie is only about 85 minutes long too so it doesn't run too long or waste too much plot with things that hamper the story.

Minor spoilers included.

Jason Patric is the lead of the film. He plays Paul, a former crime lord, whose primary rival was fellow crime lord Omar (Bruce Willis). They opening credits explain that a war broke out between the two factions and lots of blood was spilled on both sides. Finally Paul decided to end things by assassinating Omar. Instead Omar's family was killed while he survived and swore revenge on Paul. Paul's guilt over the killing Omar's family drove him into retiring from the criminal lifestyle and leaving the state. He has a daughter who is in college and one day she goes missing and he, along with help from one of her friends, tracks her down to his old turf in New Orleans. Omar finds out that Paul aka ""The Prince"" is back and begins his own search for Paul's daughter knowing that if he finds Paul's daughter first that he'll have no choice but to come to him. Which kicks off a lot of back and forth action between the two with plenty of gunfights and throw downs between Paul and Omar's goons.

Patric and Willis both deliver with Patric doing more than enough to carry the movie as the lead. Willis is also entertaining in a rare bad guy role. Biggest problem in the acting department is John Cusack, who plays an old friend who Paul's. Cusack looks like he is barely conscious while delivering his lines. Like he couldn't care less. Thankfully Cusack's role is a extended cameo and he isn't an important part of the movie. Neither is 50 Cent, who also pops up for maybe a minute as a drug dealer called The Pharmacy (yes, he's actually called The Pharmacy). Cusack and 50 Cent are both stunt casting whose appearances serve more as distractions than bolstering the story but like I said neither is in the film for long. The friend of Patric's daughter probably should only have a small role in the film, but she tags along with Patric for the story and while it doesn't make sense it doesn't really affect things too much.

Gunfights and fist fights are entertaining in the movie, though hardly on the quality of a big theatrical movie. Movie could've used some better editing. A fight scene between Patric and one of Willis' thugs is so poorly edited that I could easily tell that it was a stuntman fighting during different parts of the scene instead of Patric. Minor complaint though.

For a 30 day rental for $7, you can't really beat it. Its not an Oscar movie, but it an entertaining action thriller film. Probably the most entertaining movie I've seen from Willis in about 5-6 years.",1408752000,,2796,4.561752988047809
6568339,3,B00MEEVVYO,"Expected better because of the actors (Bruce Willis, John Cusack, 50 cent)
Wait till you can watch it for free on netflix or amazon prime.",1408752000,3,138,4.56
6568340,2,B00MEEVVYO,"This is another daddy goes vigilante to rescue his daughter film. In this case Beth (Gia Mantegna) the daughter is strung out on drugs in New Orleans. Paul (Jason Patric) her father, we later discover is the title character. He was a bad guy hitman 20 years ago and skipped town after a hit went bad. Now he is back and must face old enemies in a script so formulaic, you don't need to watch the film.

Jason Patric is no Charles Bronson, Jason Statham,, or Liam Neeson, but he was more convincing than say Neil Patrick Harris or Lou Diamond Phillips. Jessica Lowndes played his tag-a-long in an unrealistic role but is part of the formula. John Cusack had a cameo appearance as did 50 Cent. Willis managed to get some more screen time than ""The Cold Light of Day"" but it wasn't impressive as he phoned it in.

Mediocre action flick rental at best. 2 1/2 stars

I enjoyed the villain/hero , wrung dry from a life of killing . It was fast moving but the story was clear.

6568342,2,B00MEEVVYO,"Looks like most of the budget went to the cameo appearances! The story line was good but the director's presentation was terrible. Scenes were shot completely wrong most of the time. The acting left a lot to be desired. So much more could have been done with this script if it were in the right hands. Sorry Bruce and John, this had to hurt!",1408665600,3,341,4.34375
6568343,2,B00MEEVVYO,"Bad writing, worst movie I have ever seen Cusack or Bruce Willis in. These guys are getting old and desperate with the scripts they are choosing. Poor character development.

The story overall could have been a good production with the right screen play.",1408665600,,397,4.852941176470588

6568610,4,B00MEEVVYO,"Great movie! Man was I surprised to see Jason Patric! One of my most watched movies back in the day was Speed 2, mainly because I was looking a Bullock lol, but he was great in that, and great in this! Why do I detract a star you ask? Well, 1/2 star for typical shooting movie. Protagonists shoots everyone while their bullets magically miss, over and over again. Another 1/2 star for making Bruce the antagonist. Sure he did it because he can do any role, but after watching him in every movie as the hero, its really hard to see the reverse role, just making a note that I didn't care for Bruce being the bad guy. So, I'll basically take off 1 star for being like every other movie in this genre. I mean, how many times can we play the ""bad guy gets pissed off sleeper agent's daughter and he goes on rampage to get his daughter back."" ... yes it is a fantastic plot for the movie, but I saw the Taken movies and once something is done, its done... So, the positive. I haven't really seen a good action movie like this in a while, since you know, taken 3... so it was really great for me.",1476748800,,1090,4.14622641509434

6569502,5,B00MEEVVYO,"The action-filled shoot 'em up features heavyweights Bruce Gillis and veteran Jason Patric. Without giving too much away, the story is of a retired hitman who comes back for one last time to save his daughter. Patric, who plays a legendary hitman, has been living quietly in a Mississippi backwater for two decades while raising his now-college-aged daughter. She becomes ensared in the New Orleans drug culture from which her dad must extract her.

That's pretty much the storyline. The bullets fly fast and thick and, of course, the requisite number of bodies fall, as well. If it weren't for the talents of the leads, this movie could have just been another body-dropping shoot em up that left piles of cadavers all over the place. However, Patric is surprisingly effective as the dad drying to protect his daughter. Gillis is very effective as the crime lord who was wronged and who has a two-decade vendetta to fulfill. Overall, it is a surprisingly effective story.

John Cusack plays a secondary role as the hitman's friend. It is nice to see him back in a quality feature. Jessica Lowndes plays her part quite effectively as friend of Beth, the hitman's daughter. Lowndes is also strong as Patric's foil for the first half of the film. Gia Mantenga, Beth, is also strong in her role. Rapper 50 Cent did a surprisingly strong turn as The Pharmacy, a minor drug lord, while Rain was effective as Gillis' key advisor.

Altogether, the ensemble worked quite well together in creating an entertaining, action-packed film. If you have access to it, say on Prime or another service, take the time to watch it.",1469577600,,1610,4.826086956521739

6569758,4,B00MEEVVYO,"It was really ok.  I liked it contrary to other reviews.  Also contrary to other reviews, Bruce Willis is NOT a cameo appearance, nor is John Cusack or Rain.....you know, the rockstar??? They all play pretty substantial roles in this movie. 50 cent was a cameo. At first I wasn't sure if I was going to believe Jason Patric could play the gun wielding daddy but it kinda worked for him.  I think people may have been expecting Bruce Willis to be the focus of the movie and that HE would be the gun wielding daddy and when that didn't happen, they dislike the movie. It works because Jason Patric is not an emotional character and very rarely to you see him in anything that elicits any type of emotion out of him. So for this movie, it really worked out for him.  Overall, I'd never heard of this movie so it obviously wasn't a blockbuster but for being offered on Amazon prime, its not a bad watch, really. Decent story, grabs your attention, keeps you entertained throughout, lots of shooting and people getting busted up.",1468195200,,1024,4.489247311827957

6569861,3,B00MEEVVYO,"Rain, Jong Ji Hoon, is the most believable actor here. All the others just delivered their lines. Acting is more than saying lines. Movement, attitude, persona. Rain portrayed his badass, suave henchman role very well. His name should have been on the cover, since he was pretty much the main bad guy. Action is subpar compared to other action movies. Rain's fight sequence is the best action this movie offered. Music was unmoving. Cinematography, again, not very moving. Lots of Hollywood big shot names with nothing to offer. Over all, two stars. Only Rain pulls it up to three stars. I mean, look at the picture provided. Bruce Willis is wondering if he's getting paid for his three hours of filming. John Cusack is photo bombing.

6570018,3,B00MEEVVYO,An OK movie. John Cusack and Bruce Willis was hardly in the movie at all so if you expect the action packed films they usually star in you won't get it here.,1466380800,,157,3.9375
6570019,2,B00MEEVVYO,The plot was not developed.  The supporting actress's character seemed to have little significance. John Cusack and Bruce Willis have roles that are little more than cameos.  Plenty of shooting!,1466380800,,194,5.433333333333334
6570020,1,B00MEEVVYO,"Horrible storyline.  Like 100 people died just because the guy wanted to get his daughter out of a heroin house.  None of the bad guys seemed to either have a brain or know how to shoot.  Just a downright stupid movie, something to watch if you're trying to go to sleep and there isn't anything boring enough to watch on T.V.",1466294400,,325,4.295081967213115

Jason Patric is a good actor, but I don't think he did that role any justice. and Bruce Willis, he seemed so tame for the kind of character he was supposed to be playing. I also think that Rain 's part should've been larger. He was clearly the surprise win in the whole movie, however, his English needs a lot of work.",1465948800,,404,4.1923076923076925

6570162,2,B00MEEVVYO,"Formulaic modern times western where bad guy gun for hire has gone straight and now fixes cars while raising his daughter alone after savior wife expires from illness. Daughter drifts into wrong crowd at college and disappears and mechanic /former psychopathic killer must reclaim his notorious past to find her and eliminate a couple hundred underworld denizens along the way.
Patric actually does the only decent job in the movie semi - acting and looks very much like a former tough guy whose eaten too many cheeseburgers while replacing carburetors. He sports a massive birdish tattoo on his back and an illegible scripted name on his chest and is authentically very hairy with his shirt off.
Willis and a sort of bloated looking John Cusack must have had bills to pay and signed on to deliver mailed- in performances as rival underworld bosses in New Orleans. 50 Cent makes cameo appearance as a drug king pin and is dispatched too quickly to grade his performance. Gia Montegna (Joey Zasa's daughter!!) and Jessica Lowndes do the best they can all things considered.

There are no new plots, only better or different ways to present them.

It turned out to be one of my favorite movies, and I have watched it at least 5 times. The story has a good twist, and the actors play characters that are engrossing, and believable. There's alot of action, and some of it a little over the top, but it add's to the movie quite well. I recommend owning it, or just watching it when it comes on a pay

Willis and Cusack at their worst are better than just about any other actors at their best, and Jason Patrick is still great eye candy.

It's all been said from other reviewers so what I choose to add to this discussion is that after looking into his other work, I have discovered that it's all bad. So how does he continue to get big name draws to act/appear in his films? This guy must have some powerful friends in Hollywood, or he is personally wealthy, because he is utterly without directorial talent, experience or competence. I don't get it, his first credits are as an Executive Producer, then a director/screenwriter and then actor.

If you assemble a name cast, the tickets will sell and the film will work, must be the logic driving these investments. The logic fails and this is clearly a film done to ""pay the rent"" with no one aboard ever expecting the film to recoup or earn royalties.  What is amazing in a film like this is that it could have been so much better with a little effort. Clearly they had the goods to do it better.  They didn't.

The question I raise in this review:  Why is it that films such as this one seem increasingly likely to have dialogue that is barely above the level of a whisper?  I have good hearing and yet I find it necessary to turn the volume on my TV screen nearly up to the maximum to follow the speech sounds in this movie--the other sounds are more or less normal.  It seems that the director [or someone who made the decision] thought that the barely intelligible stuff would add some sort of dramatic effect.  It did not.  In the future, when it seems that this sort of ""whisper drama"" is prevalent in a film, I will just dump it.",1457308800,,828,4.296774193548387

I like that of the many big names in this movie the 'glory' was shared by several and not hogged by the One. I enjoyed Jason Patric in this role and will look for other things he has done. Willis & Cusack were classic but the character played by Jung Jihoon, a.k.a. Rain, was a bit shallow probably due to the actor being typecast (in my head) by his Speed Racer role. Major downer was excessive language 'bombs'. I realize that with this cast it's what you get, but it cost the rating 1 star.",1454630400,,613,4.385964912280702

The only reason I watched it was because I like the leads, and I didn't believe they could act in something so magnificently awful. Trust me on this one--run for your lives.

However, the bad guys always seem to carry some dialogue rather than shooting, then they plainly run out into the open, or their first shots seem to miss, or basically the bad guy's body guards have no business carrying a gun as they have zero skills with a weapon. Lastly, this highly skilled assassin takes so long to load his weapon.  I've seen Special Operational Forces guys slap in a new mag in a split second and without looking at their weapon.  I would figure this guy would at least emulate some assassin skills of sort rather than blind luck.  Lastly with the plot, his daughter suddenly becomes a junkie story seemed weak.  Why would he let his daughter go to college so close to an area where he could be recognized?

6571234,3,B00MEEVVYO,"No, this wasn't a great action movie, but it wasn't nearly as ridiculous or unpleasant or poorly acted as many reviewers have made it out to be.
It's a solid OKAY.  Jason Patric was perfectly fine.  Willis, Rain and especially Cusack had small parts that were probably filmed within a few days.
I was confused by a 20 year flashback with Bruce Willis looking exactly the same as he does in the present time parts of the movie.  It took me about 1/2 the movie to realize this was a flashback and didn't just happen.
And, there was a hostage scene that dragged on and on and on which was annoying.
All else was an acceptable action movie.
Overall:  Entertaining.  Not challenging.  3 stars.

6571235,1,B00MEEVVYO,"This movie was almost a reasonable movie but there were a lot of highly predictable action movie cliches like:

The good guy who secretly used to be the baddest bad guy on earth and is still feared and respected - but is a mild mannered person now.
The exploding car that kills loved ones when it's least expected.
The ridiculous rapper that cant act making a cameo that requires acting.
The bad guys shoot but perpetually missing the good guy.
The ridiculous shootout finale where the good guy kills 50 guys
The bad guy boss has an Asian number 2 who is ruthless and knows karate - but still isn't awesome enough to beat the good guy.
The many shootouts in very public places that don't garner any attention from the police or even passersby.
The only wound the good guy receives is from the bad guy boss at the end when they intensely exchange a few last shots.

Besides all of that, this was terribly cast. The main actor should never do action again. just.... no.... stop. Bruce Willis is not good at playing a bad guy. He just isn't. When you watch Bruce Willis it's because you like Bruce Willis. In this movie, he tries to be a bad version of Bruce Willis but that doesn't work. John Cusack was flat and uninteresting - -that's part of Cusack's appeal (for some reason) but in this it doesn't work. Everyone else was completely forgettable.

I don't think any ""my kid's in trouble, got to go save them"" movie has to have all of the car scenes that Liam Neeson (nothing against Taken series) has.  This movie was great.  I loved it all.  I do however agree with the phoning in of performances by John Cusack.  He had that coat on the entire time.  Doesn't he know you can't warm up inside with a coat on from outside (or whatever).  And then he blames Jason Patrick's character for the gun fight that Bruce Willis' character starts.  Didn't understand that part.

Could they not afford another actor and what about his hair they painted it and rolled it up couldn't anybody fix his hair during the movie had his hands in his coat pocket on every scene his portrayal was poor if it wasn't for Jason Patric I would have given this movie one star",1449014400,,612,4.473214285714286

The acting throughout is awful, presumably due to awful directing decisions, since we know at least some of this cast can deliver.  The casting seemed wrong for every character as well.

6571308,1,B00MEEVVYO,"Wow!!

I decided to pick my toe jam rather than watch anymore of this turd of a movie.
How it could have had Bruce Willis or John Cusack is beyond comprehension.
Apparently they took the money for one days work.
Half way through without seeing Cusack I turned it off.
I kept waiting for SOMETHING to make me watch more.
ANYTHING.
Seriously a turd of a movie.
In fact, I've actually had turds I've liked more.
As in gee, does that turd look like Klinger from Mash?
I feel like taking a picture of my morning dump to show you how much better my crap looks than this movie.
Seriously.
I'm going to write Bruce and John and show them the pic and then let them know how much I appreciate their work here in this ""Movie"".

Since I can't write another review I'll add a P.S.
Thank God we didn't see Jason in the shower nude because his fat gut and large man-boobs was enough.
The chick playing the ""girl"" was horrendous.  And I'm being nice.
I would really like my money back.
Oh, it was free?
Can you pay me my hourly rate to get my time back?",1448841600,,1037,4.175

The ending was a little too predictable and the last scenes of him wanting to kill the daughter of the man who killed his daughter was too drawn out...I started to believe he really didn't want revenge that bad but since the basic part of the movie was about ""getting even"" and Bruce waiting all those years to do so, my feeling is that he would have done that at the very first opportunity -- rather or not the father was suppose to see it happen.  And I was kind of left to believe that Bruce was feeling that it was really his fault his family was killed by letting his wife drive their daughter to school in his car, that was intended to blow Bruce up, instead of telling her to use her own car as he may be going somewhere sometime soon and would need his car.

I figure that the 2 people in this move worth a damn were drugged and forced to act against their own will in this movie - because Cusack and Willis were forced, and terrible.  Is this a student movie?  The guy in the lead?  Delivering lines twice - and both times, badly.  The only person who portrayed a character well was the brief time the character Angela acted like a slutty self absorbed bitchy teenager... clearly just being herself.  Once she tried acting, her skill became apparent.  I am SO disappointed in Bruce Willis.

6571769,4,B00MEEVVYO,"This film gets four stars from me only for the performances of Jason Patric (whom I admire as an actor), John Cusack and Jessica Lowndes.  The story of bad guy turned good, turned bad again is a sad and often predictable plot line, but Jason Patric (in the title role) is compelling as that guy.  Jessica Lowndes is an unknown treasure.  She is completely believable and humorous in what could easily be played as a corny character.  John Cusack's intense, soft-spoken friend of the principle makes him, once again, a bad guy you hate to hate.  The filming appears to have been done as cheaply as possible, but the director did well to cast such accomplished actors (including Bruce Willis) who, at the end, channels his portrayal as The Jackal years ago.",1444176000,,755,4.6893939393939394

6571823,3,B00MEEVVYO,This seems to be a paycheck movie.  The movie itself is a B-movie but I was thrown off my the A-list casting and because the A-list casting delivered less than B-movie performances.  I assume the three headliners did the movie for the paycheck.  It also shows the director's ineffectiveness.  You have three stars who consistently deliver their acting style for other films and directors but in this movie even the A-listers deliver less than good and consistent performances.  I think if this movie had been cast with B-movie actors it would have been better because your expectations would have been lowered.  I will say Rain who plays Mark was the most interesting character of the film.  It made me wonder if this film was made for markets outside the US.  It's not the worse movie ever but after you see it you'll shake your head at all that was lacking.  I'd give this movie a 2.5 stars.,1444176000,9,893,4.6369426751592355

The confrontation between 2 mercenaries could have been more ironic, but then this movie would have become darker (see Blood Ties, 2014, director G.Canet if you want something with a real ironic twist - and action).",1443225600,,501,4.5777777777777775

6571944,4,B00MEEVVYO,"This is ""One of those 'Film School' films""  Someone wrote something and during the editing phase of the filming it looks like the editor made a different film out of the stuff he had.

1)  This should be half of a ""Compare & Contrast"" with ""Taken"" assignment in Film School.  Why did ""Taken"" work and this did not?  For that matter, why did ""Taken 2"" & ""Taken 3"" more resemble this film than ""Taken""?  Did the same flaws make those films as bad as this one?

2)  Who is responsible for taking the obvious twisted ending out of this film and putting such a mediocre one in its place?  Was it the Editor, or the Director?  (Obviously the daughter was actually Bruce Willis's daughter that The Prince saved from the too big explosion...)  Was it the fault of the guy making too big an explosion?  Clearly someone who wanted to kill the driver didn't need to blow up the entire car, including secondary explosions in the back seat.

You would think with Bruce Willis and John Cusack it would be at least tolerable but no.  Because neither of them are on screen for more than 10 minutes total.  And they do a really bad job of explaining what the heck is going on.  You can figure it out but its annoying.  The plot was silly and not written well.  I am still not sure what happened.  Okay maybe not that extreme but I feel I should warn you that it isn't worth your time.  I am usually very east y on movies and this one was so blah I'm angry.

1. Why would Bruce Willis' character shoot someone, and have them fall into his swimming pool?  Doesn't he realize how much it will cost to clean that up?

2. I can't believe how badly both sides aim.  During the shootout, at the hotel, both sides should be quite dead.  It's way to obvious that they're shooting blanks at each other.

6572166,2,B00MEEVVYO,"with the cast, I thought, wow, this is going to be great.well its not. The acting is sub-par and maybe from Jason Patric that could be tolerated, since he is not as well known as Bruce Willis and John Cusack. There are two forgetful performances by young women.. um whats their names? Anyway, the writing is ok, the story is weak, and everything about this movie is not polished. the main character has scars from his past, the scars look like a halloween application without any real attempt at blending them to match the actors skin. John Cusack seemed to be walking through his scenes without a minuscule at acting. Bruce is Bruce, he was ok in his scenes but even he was lack luster and bland.
The movie revolves around a missing college girl, the daughter of Jasons character, and after a few days of no contact and a stranger answering her phone he goes off to find her. He checks with her college and then her dorm room there he finds a photo of his daughter and her friend (a girl) in front of a bar. He finds the girl and pays her to take him to the drug dealers that his daughter was hanging with (happens to be in a town where he was from originally). I won't go into anymore details because there is not much left but fighting, shooting, and killing until he meets his nemesis Bruce (with an agenda and vendetta).",1441324800,4,1325,4.368421052631579

6572218,3,B00MEEVVYO,Jason Patrick's character is very much cause for concern. His brooding manner is unattractively acted in a way that reveals his limits as an actor. There are obvious problems with the screen writing pitting one group of morally corrupt characters against another equally ccurrupt group and then inexplicably giving high ground to one in the end. Movie was ver slow in the beginning. I'm shocked that Cussack and Bruce Willis would be a party to this debacle. Must have been paying off a gambling debt.,1441065600,,501,4.905882352941177

typical shoot um up flick. One reformed bad guy reverting to his bad ways for a good cause. The message? Its ok and even good to do horrible acts of thoughtless violence if your daughter is in trouble, even if she caused the trouble herself.

6572353,1,B00MEEVVYO,"This movie wanted to be John Wick or the Executioner. It REALLY did. But... nope.

1) Huge inconsistencies between the legend of the Prince and the actual dude. The action scenes didn't live up the the hype that the director so eloquently wove throughout the film. Some fantastic lore. I just wish the director followed through with the strength of the buildup. The dialog built him up instead of the action. That's not entirely a bad thing in most cases but these actors couldn't pull it off. This is one time where the ""use your words"" mantra should have taken a back seat.

2) As aluded to in the previous point, the monologing is so thick, and written so porely, that Bruse Willis couldn't salvage the script.

2) Acting was hit or miss. Bruce was horrible (not on his own. He has proven his worth. I lay blame on the writer and director. ) 50 cent wasn't to shabby, which is odd. Cusack was a bit melodramatic. The two girls weren't horrible either. The main actor was a stinkfest. Again, I attribute the bad acting to the director. If you mess up a movie with a hard hitting cast such as this, you should second guess your job choice.

Overall, I felt the potential without the followthrough. Save your money.",1440547200,,1215,4.509090909090909

6572743,4,B00MEEVVYO,"Paul (Jason Patric) is a mafia hit-man in New Orleans, and with a baby on the way, he wants out. Paul thinks the only way to do that is to kill his boss (Bruce Willis). With a car bomb in place, Paul waits for his boss to leave for the day, but is shocked to see the bosses wife and daughter get into the car instead. After the tragedy, Paul and his family flea and for 18 years, live in peace, but that all changes when his daughter goes down to New Orleans for a weekend getaway and disappears. The dry, emotionless, Jason Patric stars in this film and as it turns out, he's perfect for the role. As The Prince, the heir apparent, Patric has to play both a loving father and a ruthless criminal and does so admirably. While he's listed in the background, he really is the star of the movie, with the other big names making sporadic appearances. It's a shame, because Bruce Willis's boss character seemed to be a really interesting guy, who I'd have loved to see more of and learn more about. The Prince isn't very unique and you can't help but draw parallels to A History of Violence. While not as good, the film still features some intense action and a great story. The one draw back is that the Prince is so focused on this man Paul, and his goals, that they ignore some very compelling side stories. Had I been the writer, I would have utilized flashbacks through out, to show more of the prince and the bosses story, but sadly they didn't. Aside from that I really enjoyed the film, it was a chase, a mystery, and a mafia film rolled into one, with some great cameos, and an unexpected ending. This is the kind of action film I'd love to see more of. It isn't simply about the special effects and the guns, there is a purpose behind all of it, and that makes all the difference.",1438473600,,1784,4.265486725663717
6572744,4,B00MEEVVYO,"Well, despite all the negative reviews here, I watched this and enjoyed it. It's action packed and moves along at a good pace. The central character is likeable even though  despicable. All an all, an enjoyable hour and a half. Bruce Willis and John Cusack obviously had only supporting roles in this, so I wouldn't be too hard on them, folks. If you like a lot of shoot 'em up action, you'll enjoy this one, even if it won't go down in history as one of the all time classics.",1438473600,,477,4.3

I don't think this movie did him justice. Bruce Willis is a little over-the-top, but that's expected and John Cusack was perfect in his role. I've watched The Prince several times and truly do enjoy it.

The dialogue included mumbling which I had to go back over to catch for several scenes.  That's why they get four stars instead of five.  It was a really good movie though.

I read a few of the bad reviews and the one thing they seemed to have in common is they watched it because of one of the actors in the movie that was not the main character.  I think their disappointment in the lack of airtime for their actor tainted their experience.  I do love Bruce Willis but was ok that he wasn't the main guy.

Once you realize that this movie revolves around Patric's character, it changes your expectations significantly. Patric actually does a great job playing the typical bad-ass stone faced stone cold killing machine. Is this a bit like Taken? Yes. But it is still worth watching, still full of testosterone and adrenaline pumping action, and still very satisfying.

The only thing I can think to say for this review is that either Bruce Willis, and John Cusack both lost a bet, and were forced to be in this movie, or they have some relative in common that they owed a favor to.  This must have been a ""straight to DVD"" release, and even that was a waste of money.  I can only wonder how much Amazon is being paid to put this on Prime? First time I feel like I did not get my money's worth on something that was ""Free"".  This is more like someone's High School drama project than a legit film - I think every tired clich from the ""retired assassin"" genre was included.

He let's some bimbo teenager yell at him ""you own me an explanation of your past life and why you are able to kill people with your bare hands"".  Ugh!  Don't bother unless you are desperate.

It seem like that part might of made it to the cutting room floor and your watching the movie from that point forward. The relationship and tie in of the characters are sort of far fetched. Violence wise and guns and fights in the movie were ehhhh......Thus you end up with a sort of made for TV movie or one of those double feature Bargain bin DVDs.

I read those reviews and some of the people didn't finish the film.  I finished it.  I wasn't sure how it would end till the end.  Yes, the father / assassin is under played and the story line has been used in quite a few film and Willis and Cusack don't appear till near the end of the film and don't have big parts, and true, Willis plays the villain; but there a lot of twists and turns in the movie and the acting is pretty good as well as the screen play and dialog.  Choreography of the fight scenes was pretty good; though it was like a spaghetti western where the bad guys always miss and the good guys almost always hit their target. This has a much higher body count than most of the other daughter rescue films.  It starts slow but goes up very fast at the end.  The music was appropriate for the film.  Some of the locations were really nice looking.  Lots of violence.  Lots of killing.  Drug use - showing the negative effects and a parent who seems to be able to deal with it enough to get the job done.  Unconditional parental love.  Not a good family movie.  I'd watch it again.",1436400000,2,1218,4.189655172413793

The main story line is rather straight forward and continues to stick to it very well.

6573410,2,B00MEEVVYO,"The dialogue was extremely lacking in this movie. I'm surprised that three such renown actors would have made this movie as written. Another thing: a former assassin, Jason Patric's character, is hanging around with one of his college-age daughter's friends? That's where this movie was losing me. She kept whining that she wanted to stay around him to find out what happened to his daughter - but she did not act like she was such a great friend to his daughter in the beginning of the movie. I was totally seeing a Megan Fox wannabe in the character - but of course, this actress didn't pull it off at all - and Jason Patric's character NEVER would have let this bird-brained youngster hang around with him while he was battling drug lords via his fists and GUNS. They were shot at regularly - and this professional assassin would allow this young girl to be exposed to that? At one point she was screaming at him to tell her what was going on - she said she had "" a right to know!"" Um - why was that, exactly, honey? You had NO place in this movie.  And the dialogue between this character and Jason Patric's character was so totally lame. Even poor Bruce Willis labored under the silly script. I didn't stick around long enough to meet the John Cusack character and that's too bad because I adore him. You may notice the picture advertising this movie has Jason Patric's name over John Cusack, and vice versa - so they didn't even get that right!!",1436400000,11,1451,4.475471698113208

It attempts to be a serious drama (the bad guy turned good and bad again) and at the same time be a loud shoot-them-all movie where the main character can't ever get hit by a bullet. The drama part is weak, the shooting part does not work at all. Schwarzenegger's Commando had enough silliness to make the arcade-style shooting watchable. To make the mix even worse, they sprinkled a bit of the Chinese tough guy who shots everybody with cold blood, until he meets the main character and then drops the gun and starts showing off his kung fu (and fails, of course).The Prince tried to be a bit of everything, failed to get the right balance, and turned into a big time waster.

It's not actually 4 stars, more like 3.3 due to the amount of beating a dead horse dialogue the daughter's friend gets in the beginning.

6573640,2,B00MEEVVYO,Average but should have been better. The premise was sort of far fetched and some of the action sequences beyond belief - fighting off more men than Uma Thurman did in Kill Bill without the benefit of any sort of weapon - nor did the challengers think to bring a weapon to the fight either.

I mean, it was fine for a pure action flick, but that's all it wanted to be. Plot was boring, the characters barely likeable. The college girl that was with him the entire movie was frivolous and a poor plot generator.
It's hard to judge the acting with such a bland script. I'd say Patric and Willis were fine, but nothing to write home about. Willis probably had the most interesting character, although they were all pretty much written two-dimensional. Cusack seemed uncomfortable and a bit wooden (I'm not talking about the character who should be at least a bit uncomfortable). It seemed off.

If you're looking for a bunch of action with one guy who can kick the behinds of a bunch of bad guys, then you'll enjoy this. I probably would have enjoyed it more if I hadn't gone into it expecting something more.",1435276800,,872,4.589743589743589

6573794,4,B00MEEVVYO,"I will start off with my short review. Watch it if you enjoy action movies where no brain strain is required, and you can watch at least one car chase and a whole lot of guns and blood.  It is pretty much along the lines of any of the Taken movies with less budget.

Now that I have that out of the way I am going to address a few issues I see with other reviews.

First of all, those of you complaining that B.Willis and J. Cusack only had bit parts in the movie seem to have forgotten that J. Patric is a very good actor in his own right.  Of course the movie preview is going to hype up the biggest ""action"" action star that is in it. If you are watching a movie simply because you want to watch B. Willis do the same thing he does when HE is the main star then you have absolutely no right to complain that this movie has a plot that has been done so many times before.
Secondly, B.Willis & J. Cusack have such short scenes that I think those of you complaining about ""bad acting"" are actually just peeved that you were mislead about the main character. Which I should point out if you take the time to read the cast or characters it is pretty obvious who is the main protagonist.
Now 50 Cent CAN""T ACT and he has nearly half the amount of lines of the other two and I don't see anybody complaining about him or the actress who played the friend of the daughter. THAT is poor acting.

The story was a rehash of many other similar movies, yes. What I liked about this one was that at least this guy knew he was a scumbag and held no illusions about redemption. In addition, they made no attempt to make the daughter out to be some angel in need of saving and in fact she was well on the way to killing herself.

What I found to be a little stupid in the story was how the first few non-scumbag characters the father encountered had no interest in helping him find his daughter and acted put out that he was asking. Even the friend wasn't interested until later in the game when she refused to leave, which was implausible considering her initial behaviour.  Most people will offer help to find someone so I am always annoyed when movie plots make it seem otherwise.  The Prince is certainly not the only movie script to use that device to  show how badass the main character is.  It is pretty much required plot filler in action movies.

Lastly, J. Cusacks hair. ouch. Who decided that was the look they needed for an aging rich criminal?",1434844800,,2441,4.194444444444445
6573795,2,B00MEEVVYO,Bruce and John are only in this movie for a few minutes. There is nothing new to see here. Same old rehashed plot line. Don't waste your time.,1434844800,,142,4.107142857142857
6573796,4,B00MEEVVYO,"I'll give it four stars on the premise that it is free with Prime, otherwise I'd tune that down to a 3. So if you're thinking of paying for it I'd say move along unless you're an action flick junkie. I didn't watch this for the character development or the plot or anything intellectually stimulating. I wanted a shooter movie and it fit the bill. It is comparable to the stuff that Arnold Schwarzenegger has been putting out lately like Sabotage and Escape Plan.

The things I didn't like were the cliches like all the ""bad guys"" wearing the stereotypical 90s bad guy uniform ( ball caps and sun glasses indoors ), guns shooting past slide lock, and so on. The other big thing for me was some guy that's supposedly former military bringing a pistol to a rifle fight and skipping around like no one else can aim... when he does get his hands on a rifle he uses it for all of 2 magazines which were fired continuously and from the hip... and then tosses the rifle and goes back to pistol. I feel like if some of those parameters were tweaked you'd see this thing in theaters, or more theaters at least.

Cusack and Willis gave good/small performances.  The characters were unsympathetic and not well defined.  The ""Prince"" never seemed as tough, or as good at action scenes, as they probably hoped he would be.  And he wasn't in sufficient shape to be a leading man in this type of movie.

The Prince must now venture into the one place where everyone wants him dead in order to save his daughter.
The movie is very low budget with functional script but not much else.  Bruce Willis and John Cusack have roles that don't amount to much more than glorified cameo's and when they are on the screen they're not doing anything special.  I you're desperate for something to watch or love shoot-em up action flicks than you probably won't mind investing the 90 mins it takes to watch this movie.

Meanwhile, a local mobster Omar (played by Bruce Willis) learns that Paul is back in town, and having scores to settle with Paul, starts looking for the man. Rain and John Cusack also appear.

Dont expect something like Taken here. In spite of this decent cast, The Prince fails to deliver on just about every level. The story is dull and slow-moving, and the action is generic and amateurish, something that would make you sleep.

Very exciting and very fun movie. If you drag the ""hose-bag"" along she will probably punish you by making you go see one of those ""my Mother is slowly dying of Leukemia"" melodrama movies the next trip to the flix...........but you can always plead ""the trots"" and spend most of your time either in the restroom reading something or hopefully your cinema will have some video games so you can escape the decrepitude of some starlets slowly croaking Mother.........or get a buddy to give you a call and tell the little lady it was some emergency at work that had you tied up on the phone for an hour and a half...........anyway, its worth the payback, this is one action packed, fun movies to watch with GREAT ACTING ALL AROUND!!",1434067200,,984,4.564971751412429

Patric's character is wholly unbelievable, mainly because the actions sequences are poorly choreographed.  Lowndes' performance yields one of the most annoying characters I have seen on film in recent memory.  If this was done intentionally (I doubt it), then kudos to you Miss Lowndes, you deserve an award from those folks at at Harvard.  Sadly, the talents of Willis and Cusack are wasted.  This is probably due to the hackneyed writing that is both unoriginal, and trite.

Good guys always have a shady past and use pistols.  Against overwhelming odds, the good guy with the shady past wins.  Bruce Willis has taken to appearing in anything that comes along.

6574672,2,B00MEEVVYO,"(More of a ramble than a review because I gave up on giving a plain bad movie serious effort)
Oh man, I went in knowing that this film was going to be bad, but I didn't expect it to be so boring. The Prince is another Taken-rip off, with main lead Jason Patric playing a father whose daughter has up and gone missing on him. He decides to go looking for her and in the course of doing so, the bodies begin to pile up as is usual with these aged ""badasses"" that are in these types of films. Tagging along with him is his daughter's friend Angela, played by Jessica Lowndes, who just may have given the best performance in the film because all the big names sleepwalk and all the no-names are bad. Bruce Willis and John Cusack are given prominent placement on the box art for this film and they're kind of in it, I guess, Cusack shows up as a former friend for our hero and whisper talks a lot his lines, whilst Willis plays a crime boss whose family was killed years ago (by guess who) and seems to give a full afternoon's worth of effort into his role. Korean pop star and actor Rain (Speed Racer, Ninja Assassin) plays an assistant to Willis and and I just plain feel bad that he's in this movie, he's not an amazing actor by any means but I like the guy and I'd be lying if I said the reason why I decided to slog through this film in the first place was because he's in it.
As for the contents of the film itself, it's full of uninteresting gunplay and hand to hand fighting, save for a scene with Rain that ended all too quickly and cheaply and locations so clean and empty you'd think they spent most of the budget on refurnishing the places they shot at. Even the supposed drug den where 50 Cent holds court, oh right, 50 Cent is in this movie as well, he does a good job for the five minutes he's on screen, nothing against his acting either, doesn't look all that shabby of a place to hang about. Beyond that you can probably guess how the gist of how it all plays out. I only have one last thing of note to say and it is spoilery, so know that before reading on.
The Prince is the moniker that Patric's character got when he was a mafia hitman twenty years prior to this film and he finally got out of the game after the hit on Bruce Willis's character went wrong and the car bomb killed his wife and young daughter instead of him. Hey, these things happen, right? That's actually kind of how the film treats that whole thing actually, these things happen, you were a hitman  that killed dozens of people? That was twenty years ago, it's all good now, you're a loving father trying to get his daughter, it's totally fine. Sure, you might say, he was just killing other criminals most of the time, presumably, so what? That's not a bad point but he killed criminals because they were against the criminal interests of the criminals who employed him. PLUS he blew up a mother and her daughter who was on her way to her first day of 3rd grade based on how old she looked. He suffers no repercussions for that, Willis isn't even the one who originally stole his daughter, it was all happenstance. But he gets her back, kills Bruce Willis and drives off with his daughter and her hot friend with a nice happy ending. That's actually where the title for this review comes from, he's not a good guy because he stopped being a hitman to go play mechanic some place and raise his daughter. He's still a bad guy, he just hasn't done anything bad for awhile, except be a bad dad because his daughter decided to drop out of college and do heroin, but that's neither here nor there, I guess. Point is, he got a happy, consequence free ending and he didn't deserve one and that annoyed me enough to not be generous with this film and knock off a star.",1433203200,,3746,4.2391608391608395
6574673,1,B00MEEVVYO,"This movie is purely written for dads of daughters. There are no conflicts with the main character (Which isn't Bruce Willis despite what the cover looks like), he is basically invincible. He walks straight into gunfire, and trained assassins can't hit him. Movies don't have to be super realistic but come on. The guy only gets shot once, and after a needle and thread, some alcohol and 20 minutes, he is completely unfazed.

It's a movie made for dad's that think they are invincible if they are protecting their daughters. Cute concept, but there's no drama.

Plus there's a super awkward relationship with the main guy and a girl who's at least 25 years younger. It's just weird, and wish i didn't watch it. Just watch Taken, it's the same movie.",1433203200,2,750,4.717557251908397

6574767,1,B00MEEVVYO,"Spoilers within.

I typically enjoy a good action movie, but I found this one painful. Characters are not fun or interesting. Our setup is terrible, the hero kills the wife and kindergartner of the villain on the first day of school, then disappear s because he felt bad. Come on, I want to root for the bad guy already. 20 years later, the hero's daughter makes poor decisions and decides to became a crack whore. So our hero reemerges to kill everyone in his way to rescue his daughter. I don't mind suspending reality, I enjoyed Taken, and I loved John Wick, but this was sheer stupidity. Bruce Willis character has the daughter at the end in a magic skyscraper that has no locks or security guards with any kind of reflexes or aim, capable of only running into our kindergarten killer hero's bullets. Then Bruce willis taunts him with a gun to his daughters head. Here's an idea. Since you're in a tall building, just drop the crackhead out the window when his car pulls up, lock the door, and drop some grenades or better yet, go die hard 1 and shoot a missile at him while you guards actually aim bullets down.  Nope, just nonsense and no fun. How can you feel triumphant about the kindergartner killer walking away? Terrible movie. Bryce Willis deserved a better screenplay, as did John Cusack. stay away from this one, if you want a gritty revenge flick try the horseman. If you want an enjoyable suspend reality revenge flick try John wick. This isn't worth watching for free.",1432944000,,1485,4.578947368421052

They might as well have called this a spaghetti Western in modern times. Even the guy with the high ground and the expensive rifle gets taken out with (Beretta). Why is it in action movies with gunplay the guy from the hi ground always dies yet he is better equipped than even the hero.
No muzzle awareness at any time in this movie. No safe weapons handling done by professionals at any time. Seriously Hollywood  Don't sell me on Billy badass when you can't even take the time to paint him as a professional. What professional goes to work without sighting in his stuff let alone let others fill his magazines for him.
All his old weapons would have been mothballed correctly by his (friend) Who ran the gun store. If not he himself.
 He would have taken the time to run optics on all of his stuff if he could have. (Taken was a better movie)
The biggest issue I had with this movie was how many times he (patched himself up) Seriously your either smarter or harder seldom both.

I was left un attached to anyone in this movie and was hoping that Bruce Willis or John Cusack were going to poof out of no were shoot everyone.
They could have had a spin at the end.
 All of the good people in this movie were horrible actors at least in this film and all of the bad no name actors were better than the bigger name actors. The Hero left me apathetic to even his own demise.",1432944000,,1488,4.225352112676056

6574797,4,B00MEEVVYO,"This was a surprise to me. I actually thought the formula of the movie and possible the combination of actors was going to make for a lame formulaic movie where I knew how it would end before it started. :-) Instead - the movie has me really guessing (and wrong, I might add). It starts off with a scenario - that is not explained, and one ingredient is missing. Then the story moves into a whole different ballpark. At this point you start to wonder what the first part had to do with the second part - and I don't know about others but I was way off the mark. But I loved that. I like being wrong and not really knowing how it's going to end. That's where good suspense comes in and all movies should have that! I don't want to talk too much about the actual scenes and plot for fear of giving a spoiler out. But I can say that I really enjoyed it. It takes a very long time for the reason why the movie is called the Prince - but once it comes out - it's very interesting explanation and helps with identifying with the ""hero"" of the story.[Possible spoiler alert]  And having a hero in this story is hard - they are all bad guys - just different degrees! :-)
For a movie to make 5 stars from me - I have to want to watch it over again, or I find myself wishing for a sequel. This movie was great - but I probably won't watch it again because now I know the suspenseful parts.

So if you are going to watch this movie because you like these actors then you are going to hate this movie.  No watch this movie for Jason Patric's performance.  There is no flash, no blustering, just an understated performance of a father/killer.  Never once did I not believe that Patric wasn't a father looking for his daughter. I believed he cared and that he was hurting and I truly believed that he was the biggest B.A. in the movie. He was always in control and when said he was going to kill someone it was done such of a matter of fact way that it felt real.  The action scenes were not the usual over the top stuff that we get today.  No it is realistic and like the acting understated too.  The shoot out in the drug den reminded me of the old film Rolling Thunder[an excellent film].  This leads me to say this about Jason Patric.  He is not the model action hero and that is my point of this review.  He isn't cool looking, cool talking, and he doesn't crack one joke in the whole film.  This all makes him seem like a ""normal"" killer and a breath of fresh air.

6574845,2,B00MEEVVYO,"The Prince (2014)

 We put The Prince very much into the shoot'um up category in filmdom.  A retired hit man comes out of retirement in order to rescue his heroin addict daughter from some very bad people.  Ok, this is kind of a classic theme in shoot'um up movies, so nothing much new there.  Throw in a tragic hit gone wrong 20 years in the past.  The victims of the wrongful hit were the wife and little daughter of a New Orleans gangster.  New Orleans is just where the addict daughter has gone to find a swift and certain death.  We can live with the story line.
 But........Andre Fabrizio and Jeremy Passmore give us a script that does not build the story, increasing the tension until the ultimate battle, which they should have. Instead, we have our characters meandering around in a totally disconnected way.  Events seem to happen in a random way, when ever the story needs something, it just pops up from nowhere.  The writing does not meet professional standards.
 Nor does the direction by Brian A. Miller.  The main job of the director is to elicit the best possible efforts from his cast.  In The Prince we have a band of terrific actors, Bruce Willis as Oman, the gang lord in New Orleans, Jason Patric as the distraught hit man and John Cusack as the old pal and helper of the hit man.  All three of these guys look like they over dosed on Prozac while filming the movie.  It takes a substantial lack of directorial skill to ruin three fine actors.
 Rapper 50 Cent turns in an acceptable if small role as a drug king pin.  The real star in terms of a good performance is Jessica Lowndes.  She plays the screwed up friend of the addict daughter who helps dad find his little girl.  She takes the slender role and makes it into the only memorable bit of acting in the whole film.
 Even a shoot'um up has to have more than dead bad guys to make it worth watching.  Not this one.
 The public awarded this film a teeny weeny $1.4 million at the box office.  I hope the producers learned their lesson.",1428537600,8,2012,4.390243902439025

Jason Patric plays the daddy of some college bimbo who drops out and gets into the bad news drug scene with ""The Pharmacy"" (Jackson).  Patric had a bit of history with Willis and Cusack.  The former being foe, the latter a friend.  Patric has to call in a few favors along the way of the eventual rescue.

There's nothing new or different in this movie.  The acting is pretty sad, the script mediocre and formula old and worn.  Even the brand name of Willis couldn't make this any better than a 3* film.

6574862,1,B00MEEVVYO,"Damn what a waste of some pretty good talent with a cast that includes Jason Patric, John Cusack, Rain, Bruce Willis, and to a much lesser extent rapper 50 Cent. Jason Patric stars as the titled ""The Prince"" or Paul. Paul isn't a likable character or even a likable anti-hero, and has the personality of a door stop in that he has none. I like John Cusack is a talented actor, but here in the Prince his talent is wasted in a throw away role as Sam an old associate of Paul's. Rain is a multi-talented actor, musician, and producer who starred in a decent film in Ninja Assassin, but compared to The Prince, Ninja Assassin is the best action film ever, and again Rain's talents are wasted as Omar's right hand man. Yes Curtis Jackson is a rapper, and will never be a great actor, but Jackson is capable of giving some decent and entertaining roles if not good acting performances as Jackson did in Twelve and Streets of Blood, but here in The Prince, Jackson has like two lines as a richly developed character named The Pharmacy before Paul shoots him in the chest. Oh yes I forgot about Jessica Lowndes as Angela who is only around for eye candy and nothing more.

What has happened to Bruce Willis's career? I mean the actor was once one of if not the biggest stars in Hollywood staring in the Die Hard films, 12 Monkeys, The Fifth Element, Armageddon, and Pulp Fiction, who could basically do no wrong. Now sure he has the occasional hit or critically well received films like Looper and Moonrise Kingdom, but those films are few and far between the endless mediocrity, and downright crap the actor as given us in Surrogates, Catch .44, The Cold Light of Day, A Good Day to Die Hard, and The Expendables franchise. Willis continues to give us crap here in The Prince playing the villain Omar who wants revenge on Paul for murdering his wife and child. There are many problems with his role, and the character, but I'll get to that in a minute. I hope things turn around for Willis career, but with the likes of Vice and Rock the Kasbah I doubt it.

All right I'm sure everyone wants to know what the terrible action film is about, well it's about a group of unlikable characters killing each other. We have Paul as the retired Prince, who has been retired for twenty years now works as a mechanic in a quiet life until his daughter disappears. Paul returns to New Orleans in search of his daughter where he meets up with Angela and they go on search for his daughter. Somehow two men who work for Omar who look like they're in their late twenties or early thirties recognize Paul as The Prince even though it has been twenty years since anyone has seen Paul, and the two men would have barely been born. Yeah its best not contemplate the obvious great writers that were hired to come up with the superbly written script the script for The Prince. Anyway let's go back to the great plot. Omar finds out about the return of Paul who was the man who murdered his wife and child twenty years earlier, and wants him dead. This leads to showdown at a hotel and the death of Omar the end.

Obviously the writing was terrible. The dialog was robotic at best, the characters were unlikable or uninteresting, and the supposed bad guy Omar ended up being the good guy in the film. Omar was supposed to be the villain, but he didn't get enough screen time, and by the end of the film he ends up looking like a saint compared to Paul. The action was absolutely forgettable, and I mean that I finished watching The Prince four hours ago, and I can't remember any of the scenes outside of the terrible climax, which takes place at a hotel that's supposed to look like Omar's base of operations. Paul in a not even remotely exciting or riveting action sequence storms the building to rescue his druggie daughter and is video game like in that Paul just hides behind pillars waiting for the stupid guards to stupidly for no reason come out into the open to get shot.

What the hell is Brian A. Miller directing an action film. I have heard of the man before as he was a producer at Cartoon Network bring shows like Cow and Chicken, Samurai Jack, Johnny Bravo, and Dexter's Laboratory to us, but what the hell does Miller know about directing a life action, action film, which is obviously nothing because of how poorly directed The Prince was put together. The editing was bad, the camera angles were horrible, and the cinematography sucked. Really how the hell was this film managed to get made. I know of course its Hollywood, and there are many bad films made every year, but I mean The Prince is terrible, so how the hell was the film able to get made with Bruce Willis and a decent cast. One would think the once Hollywood king would have stopped for a second and looked at the script and then looked at his director stopped The Prince from getting made or at very least backed out from the project, but I guess that show us how far Willis's career has fallen in that he needs the money so bad he has to do a film like The Prince.

Do I really need to say any more about this terrible film? Let me just leave my review with this parting thought The Prince is the worst film I have seen this year and one of the worst action films I have ever seen, and I would give anything to get back that ninety minutes of my life.",1423008000,8,5308,4.379310344827586

This is his first English speaking movie since 2009's 'Ninja Assassin'. This movie is coming right out of his discharge from compulsory military service (and he hasn't been active in American promotions since that time) so I am cutting him some slack but his accent is SOOOO thick its kind of hard to understand what he's saying without subtitles. He looks so good, that he looks kind of out of place among the scruff and gruff co-stars.

Sadly, the writing and storyline is SO BAD that it takes away from the few scenes that Jihoon oppa is in. The fight scene is alright but is terribly predictable.

6574893,3,B00MEEVVYO,"It seems like its been far too long since Jason Patric offered us a performance to watch. A major part of the reason for that was his legal battles for custody of his son (congratulations to him on that final victory). His movies have been sporadic for a while now and only recently has he been attached to a number of films. So with his return you had to wonder if hed be up to turning in a good performance. With THE PRINCE the answer is yes.

Patric plays Paul, a mechanic who dotes on his daughter away now at college. When he discovers she has dropped out and not told him, he tries to contact her. Unable to reach her he starts his search for her by contacting a friend he sees in a picture with her. When he contacts her and offers to pay her for her help, she agrees, making fun of him when any opportunity arrives.

He discovers that the life his daughter has been leading was not what she portrayed and rather than a good student shes become an addict. Information leads him to New Orleans where he learns shes been taken by a dealer. A quick trip to a bar and meeting with an old friend leaves you realizing that Paul is not who he claims to be either. Instead the story unfolds about him being the most feared hit man the locals had heard of, a boogey man of sorts that all feared.

As Pauls search for his daughter moves forward the body count starts to rise and the friend begins to realize that this is someone no one would mess with. Moving from clue to clue to find his daughter another problem arises. It seems that his reason for leaving the business behind revolved around the biggest crime boss of New Orleans, a man named Omar (Bruce Willis). With a personal grudge against Paul his chances of leaving the city alive with or without his daughter begin to diminish. He might get help from his old friend Sam (John Cusack) but will that be enough to get him through a final confrontation with Omar?

The movie has a TAKEN feel to it with a father equipped with deadly skills taking on all comers as he tries to rescue his daughter from impending doom. The fact that shes far from innocent changes things as well as the profession he once left. Patric handles the role perfectly with enough emotion that you believe him as the concerned father but with that cold atmosphere surrounding him that says don't get in his way. Willis turns in another minor role here as the heavy with little screen time but enough to let him show his acting skills. Wasted here is Cusack who offers what amounts to a cameo role. I would have loved to see more of him here, especially when you recall his own performance as a hit man in GROSSE POINT BLANK.

All in all the movie offers a solid story and plenty of action to hold your interest from start to finish. Its enjoyable enough that I can see myself watching it again down the road, something that few movies seem to do for me these days. While definitely not for kids, the movie is a good example of this sort of action flick. At the end you start to wonder if it wouldnt be a sure fire hit to team up Patrics Paul with Liam Neesons Bryan Mills against a ton of bad guys. One can always hope.",1417564800,,3148,4.275167785234899

6574897,4,B00MEEVVYO,"How far will a father go to rescue his daughter from a drug dealer?
Jason Patric stars in this ultra-violent tale of a former mob enforcer who, after inadvertently killing a mother and child, flees New Orleans and winds up in a small Mississippi town where he goes to work as a mechanic. Twenty years pass and his daughter is away attending college where she is, apparently, doing well. One day, however, he gets a letter saying she's apparently dropped out even though she had given him no indication that she has left school.
That sets in motion a chain of events that leads the mechanic back to New Orleans where he goes in search of his lost daughter accompanied by one of her friends from school who knows where she was last seen. It doesn't take him long to discover that  his daughter is hooked on heroin and he sets out to rescue her. Doing so means he will eventually run up against Bruce Willis, a longtime enemy, and John Cusack, a former friend and partner.
The plot is nothing to boast about and the dialogue is pretty standard but Patric, Willis, Cusack and Jessica Lowndes give fine performances in a movie that has the feel of an updated spaghetti western complete with a mysterious anti-hero ala Clint Eastwood's ""Man With No Name."" It is their performances - especially those of Patric and Lowndes - that make this movie worth seeing.
Patric, who is a very fine and very versatile actor, is coldly efficient as the former killer turned concerned father and Lowndes is suitably annoying in the early part of the film as a young woman with no specific aim in life except to party. She brings a subtle maturity to her role as the movie progresses and - thankfully - isn't asked to suddenly transform into a ninja to help Patric rescue his daughter.
This is a good film, though very violent and somewhat stereotypical, but if you're a fan of action movies it's one that I think you'll enjoy.",1416441600,,1905,4.553935860058309

6574916,4,B00MEEVVYO,"Hey, it's not amazing, but it certainly is damn good.  Let's address the flaws first:

1) Our favorite bald-headed crime boss has a right hand man who cannot speak English well and looks like a stylish transvestite.  But, I have to give it to him-her: he-she can FIGHT!

2) A few gun battles get a bit unrealistic.  Our brave father figure runs out into fire as if he had a few Mario power ups in his pocket.

3) He doesn't miss much either.  I own guns.  In tense situations, you miss.

4) Cusack is sorely under-utilized.  His acting is perfect.  But nothing much about him is explained.  Missed opportunity.

5) And SURPRISE guest star Johnathon Schaech plays a cool-as-hell Southern gun range owner who is under-used as well.  I'd LOVE to have seen this guy get into the action somehow.  Missed opportunity.

6) The writing does not delve deep enough, but it is passable fair.  *** SPOILER ALERT ***  Why is his daughter a junkie?  No idea.  Why is she lying to him?  No idea.  Why does she prefer to sleep at 50 Cent's slumlord house instead of her pretty apartment?  No idea.  We have no reason to care about this girl like Patrick's character does.  But because he portrays such a troubled, genuine father figure, you keep watching.

7) The ending action is CLICHE to the MAX.  The very last part of the very last standoff with Willis.  You'll see.  You've seen this move in movies from 1985 onward.

8) Why in HELL would you let your daughter go to college anywhere NEAR the place where MAJOR CRIMINALS want you dead!?!  That is not an in-character choice and ruins a lot of the movie for those who think.  Because Patrick plays a pretty solid, cautious, quiet ex-criminal.

Still, this movie is entertaining.  The main character is interesting.  His hot-as-hell sidekick is a great actress, a pain in the butt for him, and helps keep the tension up.  There are a few really great encounters that SHOW instead of TELL who this protagonist was before he became a loner mechanic in Mississippi.  The action is brutal and fun.  The acting is perfect--even by the minor characters, so that is much appreciated.

But when an action film is released to VOD, it does raise a red flag. After all, VOD is slowly becoming the new direct to DVD in the sense that, yeah, a film was completed, but the companies involved, you are given the impression, don't have faith in its box office success. Leading to the question: Is The Prince part of Bruce Willis becoming like Steven Segal and releasing a bunch of action movies barely worth mentioning, or perhaps is this film something which deserves to be put alongside his Die Hard work?

Characters & Story
Off the bat, lets note Omar (Bruce Willis) is not the main character. He is this villain who has long waited for Paul (Jason Patric) to show up in New Orleans for him to get revenge. But revenge, and Omar, isn't really on Pauls mind. His focus is his daughter Beth (Gia Mantegna) who has gone missing and outside of Beths friend Angela (Jessica Lowndes), who provides some direction, he has a hard time trying to find his kid. But with Beth being the only thing Paul has left to make life worth living, he becomes willing to go back to his old ways just to find his daughter.

Praise

It has a beginning, middle and end; the fight scenes were okay; and thats about it for praise.

Criticism

Being someone who isn't a huge action movie fan, this film just covering the basics when it comes to story made it a very dull picture to watch. Add on that Patric isn't the most interesting, charismatic, nor inspiring, type of hero, and you get a dull movie. Also, add in that Angela, for a good part of the movie, is annoying as all hell for mostly she just flirts with Paul and get high. Then, in terms of Willis and Rain, neither make for compelling villains for Rain never rises above being a lackey, and Willis doesnt seem like a bad ass at all.

Though the real big issues come from two things: A story which avoids becoming complex, and the difficulty of trying to see Paul as the hero. You see, to me this film is geared more toward Omar seeming like he should be the protagonist and Paul the villain. Then, to make things interesting, the film could have mixed in Omar looking for Paul, building an empire and army to take on a man like Paul, and him biding his time vs. Paul who has long since retired from his past life and simply wants to find his daughter. However, instead what we are given is Paul as the hero whose sole means of redemption was raising a daughter and retiring from his past life. Something which doesnt feel like it is enough to root for him being successful. Which, I admit, is mean to say when it comes to Beths fate, but with Paul coming off as some sort of Rambo storming New Orleans and never becoming likable, it makes you almost hope that the film would end with Omar getting his revenge, and Beth being alive but fatherless. But with the cast this film has, even with the complexity I would have liked to see, I doubt they would have been able to give such character the performances required and deserved.

Overall: Skip It

Honestly this could be labeled TV Viewing, but Im labelling it as Skip It since it offers nothing to really make it worth checking out. There are no plot twists, no really good performances, and the action is all basic shoot em ups and a few kicks and punches here and there. Something which I don't think can really cut it anymore in a world where there are so many fighting styles, so many talented writers out there, and such a diverse mix of options which seemingly this film ignored.",1410566400,20,3698,4.3648255813953485

Jason Patric walks into a bar to talk to this guy who his daughter was dating, then things get heated and the second before Jason Patric was about to pull a Chuck Norris on everyone at the bar, a man comes out of nowhere and breaks up the fight, he starts telling this story about how he witnessed Jason Patric roundhouse kick about 30 guys 20 years ago and feels he is so fortunate to have survived that incident so he can live to tell this story now and prevent Jason Patric ""The Prince"" from destroying everyone at the club...

With ""The Prince"" I'm making an exception, because I felt that I should provide a warning to those on a budget and who don't want to risk spending their hard earned cash on something they probably won't enjoy.

Normally, I like Bruce Willis.  And I like movies that fit the description provided for this film.  Sadly, however, this is one of the very rare films that bored me to the extent that I was able to endure only part of it before I decided that I didn't want to waste any more of my evening - even though I had actually paid to watch it.

For one thing, Bruce must have worked an entire afternoon to film his total amount of screen time. He finally showed up on screen well into the movie.  By then, I hadn't managed to work up any sort of connection to any of the other characters, realized that I really didn't care what the Hell eventually happened to them - and wasn't finding the ""hero"" to be at all believable.  I think that Jason Patric was an inappropriate fit for the role - but then again, I don't believe that *anybody* could have done much with it.

The entire concept has been overdone already. And done *much* better.  Daughter of retired bad ass kidnapped and bad ass has to rescue her, taking out several men at a time all by himself along the route, etc. etc. etc.

In short, this isn't a good movie - for multiple reasons.  And I highly recommend that you spend your rental money on something that you're reasonably certain you'd enjoy.

6574945,3,B00MEEVVYO,"I want to preface this review by stating: I am not a fanboy of Director Brian A. Miller.

It just seems that way. <g>

Honestly had no idea who did this flick and was genuinely shocked to see his name in the credits.

It wasn't that long ago when I first encountered Miller by way of a random B-Flick selection titled ""The Outsider"". Thought then that he had the makings of a really good director (reminding me of a young David Twohy) but that he needed a larger budget and a grander stage.

That hasn't changed. Another solid B-production only re-validates that position.

Opens as a rural Mississippi car mechanic's beloved daughter is lost to drugs and a scumbag pimp.

He's not going to let that happen.

But that means a return to his old stomping grounds - The Big Easy. And back then, the man wasn't working on cars.

Paul was a contract murderer. Possibly the best assassin that has ever come out of New Orleans - and given the city's infamous reputation - that's saying a lot.

Two decades ago he gave it all up.

Having been a soldier in a crime war, his job was to take out the leader of the opposition. But in a completely unexpected and unforeseeable moment - his car bomb killed the man's wife and young daughter. Horrified, he decided that that was that. No more money, no more booze, no more death. His penance was to live the rest of his life in humble obscurity.

The only way to get his little girl - he has to go back and travel into the dark places. And he knows that once he's recognized - old enemies will be alerted. You can't kill another man's family and not expect retribution.

Enjoyed this action boilerplate. And I can't say enough about Jason Patric - he's been an underused and undervalued actor for so long; the man really deserves more prominent roles equal to his abilities. If you have a chance, check him out as a bad guy in ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Losers/dp/B003RUX2VE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Losers</a>"" - an exceptional action flick that showcases the handsome actor's hilarious cold-blooded side.

And props to Bruce Willis, whom I've noted over several different films, is obviously taking on smaller roles to fund his retirement. His performances in these low-budget grinders metronome from tragically worthless to pretty dang good. In this flick - ringing 'good' on the Acting O'Meter. The role as gangland boss clearly wasn't meant to stretch his skill set, but I've seen him do forgettable walkthroughs in other similar productions, so I'm grateful.

My criticisms are minor.

First is that Miller replicated his work on ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Outsider/dp/B00IXE1W2A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Outsider</a>"".

Second, John Cusack was way underutilized. To me, he would've served the project better having played the role of the gun shop/armorer guy. Done by way of his trademarked hyper-wacky tick-filled portrayals, would've added a nice comedic side note to the film. Additionally, he should bring his own hair stylist onto these kinds of budget conscious get-togethers. Yikes.

Finally, I resent the sacred cow mentality of these screenplays. It would make these flicks so much more interesting if one or two of the good guys didn't make it home.

Overall, a very watchable action flick that I hope puts a brighter spotlight onto Miller and Patric.",1409616000,,3411,5.082437275985663
