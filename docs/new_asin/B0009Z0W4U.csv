i hope he does more work like this.... there is one small bad element, where he keeps asking the same question over and over again.... other than that. excellent...",1128729600,3,419,4.109756097560975
8201142,3,B0009Z0W4U,"...no, he doesn't know much about the history. Yes, he did do some homework on the subject, but this was more about its entertainment value and is home-movie quality at best. There are some awkward moments as he tries to ""interview"" some of the locals. And some of the things he says about what he is observing is just plain incorrect. But if you're in the mood to watch Brian be funny for about a half hour, then by all means pick this up...",1127520000,2,442,4.273809523809524
8201143,5,B0009Z0W4U,"AC/DC'S BRIAN JOHNSON RULES!!Didn't know what to expect. This was so hot! It is a really funny transition from the PBS type TV program to the out takes.  He can out cuss a sailor,out drink the locals and still maintain! The scenery is awsome and his knowledge of history is amazing.

Totally different side of the AC/DC mouth man. Hope this isn't the last acting he does. Love it!",1127260800,2,380,4.492753623188406
