6866138,1,B00Q8OAGRY,"I loved the scenery in the movie, and the portrayal of the Cuban people. Makes me want to go see Cuba for myself. The acting and the storyline, however, were terrible! All it needed was Elvira narrating from the side, to spruce it up!",1434758400,5,234,4.340909090909091
6866139,3,B00Q8OAGRY,Had a little bit of an unexpected twist. I only watched it because it starred Greg Wise whom I haven't seen anything new of in sometime.,1433721600,,136,4.269230769230769

6866142,4,B00Q8OAGRY,"Started slow and appeared to be predictable and cliche. However, I am happy I stayed the course. I realized that I liked and cared about the protagonist enough to compel me to continue watching. I'm glad I remained engaged in the film. It has some piquant moments that resonated with me and left an impression; a rare thing in my experience. I watched this film on impulse based upon its cover art, without reading the synopsis and without any expectations. I was entertained. Well done!",1433203200,2,487,4.741176470588235

6866155,2,B00Q8OAGRY,"Bad storyline, bad acting, bad writing, bad character development, and just plain bad describe this low budget B movie.  The scenery is great but you are better off searching images of Havana on the web.",1446422400,,203,4.8
6866156,3,B00Q8OAGRY,It was ok. Nothing great.,1445644800,,25,4.2
6866157,5,B00Q8OAGRY,"A touch of Noir, Coen Bros, and Hitchcock.  Yes a Canadian production on modest budget but thank god no special effects to distract from a solid story telling.",1442620800,,159,4.678571428571429

6866159,4,B00Q8OAGRY,"A strange movie, from the very beginning has a lot of holes in it. You are wanting more information about the main character, it seems like either the writer or director wasn't sure what they were doing. But it is a movie with a surprise--one of those I never would have expected that--and you are left realizing they put one over on you.",1440374400,,338,4.380952380952381

6866161,5,B00Q8OAGRY,It was hilarious. Not my wife's cup of tea but my two daughters and I thought it was excellent.,1439769600,,95,4.052631578947368
6866162,4,B00Q8OAGRY,What a charming contract killer!  But all is not as it seems.  Watch out for the surprise twist at the end.,1439596800,,107,4.0476190476190474
6866163,1,B00Q8OAGRY,One of the dumbest movies I've wasted my time on.,1439596800,,49,4.0
6866164,4,B00Q8OAGRY,"Good movie. Surprise ending was nice and unexpected.  Having just been to Cuba, it was nice to see all the Cuban landscapes, etc.",1438819200,,129,4.608695652173913
6866165,1,B00Q8OAGRY,"One of the wqorst movies I have ever seen. Worst written script ever. The author keeps tryng to deliver plot surprises to you - but none of them are believable. From a writer's perspective, this is a truly dishonest film. None of the plot works.",1437868800,,245,4.466666666666667
6866166,4,B00Q8OAGRY,I liked it very much. Dry humor. The scenes of Cuba are great.,1435622400,,62,3.8461538461538463

8690897,3,B00Q8OAGRY,"Good Story line tarnished by amatuer acting (excluding Gil Bellows) in some scenes gives this film 3 stars. While not a horrible flick it is beautifully shot on scene in Cuba & Gil Bellows delivers a solid performance followed by a plot twist in the mix. While definitely not worth the purchase price of $10 bucks for the HD version, if it ever makes Amazon's $4.99 sale list...Cop That!",1512777600,,387,4.6231884057971016
8690898,4,B00Q8OAGRY,An ending I did not expect. What a welcome change from modern films that are all too predictable.,1485388800,,97,4.444444444444445

8690903,1,B00Q8OAGRY,Terrible movie. Do not waste your time. Not even the limited panoramic views of Havana cannot save this production. Whoever contributed financially to this movie deserves to spend the rest of his life in the Cuban countryside.,1470787200,,226,5.135135135135135
