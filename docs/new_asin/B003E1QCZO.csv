4112691,5,B003E1QCZO,"I was fortunate to attend a private screening in NJ on 3/20/2010, hosted by none other than Tim Sullivan himself! Forget seeing the ""director's cut""...see a movie WITH the director to get first-hand behind-the-scenes dope on the movie and his thoughts and views! Now that's a treat!

There was blood everywhere...and laughs, too! From the opening scene, you knew you were in for a treat. Table saws, electric chairs, gallons and gallons of blood; it had it all, including a healthy dose of breasts! Tim is an equal-opportunity offender in this, and I mean that in a good way! Nothing was sacred: Dumb blondes, bimbos, stereotypical rednecks, a crucified chicken, etc. It was a HOOT!

It wasn't your typical ""No...don't open that door!"" horror film. You knew everyone was going to die; it was just a matter of how and when, and how much fun Mayor Buckman and his gang was going to have killing them all. And boy, did they have fun! The movie ends with them advertising for folks to visit them. Did I hear someone say ""2001 Maniacs: Granny's Revenge""?

Bill Moseley (as Mayor Buckman) was an excellent replacement for Robert Englund. He shed a different light on the Buckman character than did Englund and it was refreshing. He was one crazy ""illegitimate child""!

Lin Shaye (as Granny Boone) was fantastic! Reprising her role from the 1st ""Maniacs"" movie, Lin did Granny proud. Her ""Flashdance - She's a Maniac'"" spoof scene was outrageous! If you're going to ask Lin to cut up a chicken for you, stand back about 50 ft!

Go see this film! Buy the DVD when it comes out in the US in late July 2010!",1270684800,7,1597,4.648936170212766
4112692,5,B003E1QCZO,"Tim Sullivan has made a film that will offend ninety percent of the people on earth. The other ten percent should see 2001 Maniacs: Field of Screams! .... Heck! ...Even if you are easily offended, you should see the film and you will laugh at the jokes that don't anger you.

This film should be seen with an audience of people who enjoy seeing splatter films. See it with as many friends as you can. This film would be perfect for midnight showings and could easily reach a cult status. When you buy the video, invite friends over and have a ""Maniacs"" party!

For the people who are disappointed that several of the original cast had been replaced or left out....don't be. Not once during the film did I think that ""this would be better if Robert Englund was playing Mayor Buckman"". Bill Moseley played the character so well, that in one scene, I could see no one else other than Mr. Moseley doing the part. Tim's muse, Lin Shaye takes her character to another level and is excellent as always.

I've seen many splatter films, and there are not many deaths on film that can shock me. When Nivek Ogre prepares to eliminate one of the victims, I thought, ""No! ....Mr. Sullivan is NOT going to show this!!! ""....but he did. I felt a little guilty of laughing at the violence I saw, but if you enjoy the cartoon violence of an Itchy & Scratchy short, you will enjoy this.

Watching ""2001 Maniacs: Field of Screams"" is like being on a roller coaster to hell.... and loving it!",1270684800,4,1472,4.4609665427509295

4112716,1,B003E1QCZO,"2001 MANIACS: FIELD OF SCREAMS (2010) - This film was shot in 12 days for $400,000, but it has the look and feel as if it was filmed in one night on a drunken dare for $1.99. This sequel to director Tim Sullivan's 2001 MANIACS (2004), which was also directed and co-written by Sullivan, doesn't have one redeeming quality or an ounce of originality. Even Robert Englund refused to return as deadly Mayor George W. Buckman; this time replaced by Bill Moseley, who is beginning to appear on a lot of bad films lately. The story is simple: When the Southern sheriff of Pleasant Valley refuses to cooperate with Buckman and his Confederate Civil War era cannibalistic group (Which includes an Asian woman and a black man. What the?), taking down the detour sign (spelled ""Detore"", which I guess is supposed to be funny because Southerners can't spell) to lure Northerners to their deaths, Buckman has the sheriff killed (the old nails in the rolling barrel gag, which was missing from the first remake) and decides if the North won't come to Pleasant Valley, they will come to the North. They all hop on a bus and end up in Iowa (Is that even the North?) where a reality show called ""Road Rascals"", about two spoiled and dumb Paris Hilton/Nicole Ritchie-wannabe sisters, is traveling in an RV, when it hits the ""Detore"" sign, giving them two flat tires. Only having one spare tire and no cell phone service (No cell phone service in Iowa? C'mon now!), this aggravating group, which includes the two snotty rich girls (one of them walks around holding the taxidermied remains of her small dog), their boyfriends (one of them is a closeted gay man), a lesbian European producer, a Jewish director, an Hispanic driver and his black girlfriend (How's that for diversity?), are met by Mayor Buckman, Granny Boone (Lin Shaye, one of the few returning cast members from the first film) and their clan. They hold their annual ""Guts 'N' Glory Jamboree"", where they slowly (and I mean slowly) beging murdering and eating the cast and crew of the reality show. One girl is strapped to a table and has a buzzsaw rip her in half from her nether regions to her head. The lesbian producer has her face ripped off by a contraption in the Milk Maiden's (Christa Campbell, another returning cast member) chastity belt. The black girl is hanged by the old throwing tomatoes (instead of baseballs) at a bullseye gag, which releases a trap door under her feet (Hey, hasn't this been done before, but more effectively in director H.G. Lewis' original TWO THOUSAND MANIACS - 1964?). The Hispanic guy is impaled on a pitchfork, only to survive (he acts like it is only a minor flesh wound) and end up decapitated when Buckman slams the bus' hood on his head. Another guy is electrocuted until his eyes explode out of his skull. And so one and so one. Truth be told, there is not one original death in the film that we haven't seen done better a hundred times before, but we have to put up with some of the worst cases of humor (a lot of it setting Civil Rights back 200 years) ever committed to film, including a cringeworthy bit where Granny Boone leads her cannibal ladies in a song and dance routine based on the film FLASHDANCE (1983), substituting the song ""Maniac"" with one called ""Cannibals"", which leads to the question: How would cannibalistic Civil War Southerners, who rise only one day a year, know anything about FLASHDANCE? Everything about this film is below par, from the photography, editing, music, performances (Bill Moseley is horrible [he sings a song of his own composition over the end credits] and Lin Shaye looks embarrassed, which she should be. The rest of the cast, including returning actor Ryan Fleming as the gay Hucklebilly, who likes to #*%! his stuffed sheep, are annoying as heck and there is not one victim that has any redeeming quality, so we don't care if they live or die.) and especially the sound. The dialogue sounds like it was entirely looped later in a studio, as it really doesn't match the acoustics of the settings. The finale, where a pregnant Granny Boone delivers a black baby (Clearly, they used a young black boy about two years-old for the baby!), is about as funny as watching people jump to their deaths from a burning building. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this, but if your must watch it for masochistic reasons, stay away from the R-Rated version and rent the Unrated Version, as it doesn't cut away from the gory deaths, adds an entire cannibal dinner scene not seen in the R-Rated version, extends other scenes and offers more copious nudity (the only reason I stayed watching till the end), adding over three minutes to the running time. Unlike director Tim Sullivan's (DRIFTWOOD - 2006) first remake, Eli Roth and Scott Spiegel are not listed as one of the 14 producers here, although the late David F. Friedman (who passed away in 2011) and the still-living Hershell Gordon Lewis are listed as Executive Producers. I bet they were both wincing in pain when they saw how badly this film turned out. At least the first remake had a professional sheen to it. This sequel offers none of that. Also starring Nivek Ogre, Morgan Phan, Andrea Leon, Ahmed Best, Asa Hope, Katy Marie Johnson, Alex Luria, Larayia Gaston, Trevor Wright, Miles Dougal, Alana Curry, Jordan Yale Levine and Earl Roesel.

I Loved this movie, didn't care for the first, and I'm pretty sure most of you don't realize this comes from a movie called Two Thousand Maniacs that was made back in 1964 by Something Weird.

4112733,1,B003E1QCZO,"Many of the reviewers either talk about the rocker of a film Field Of Screams purports to be, or the POS it is instead, but no reasons are given.  Be specific, people!  Let's see if we can dissect this POS (oops, gave that one away, didn't I?) a little bit.  What!-a politically correct horror movie?  Believe it.  Sure there are some superficial racial slurs to add some verisimilitude, but the sheen is not unlike the united nations of rascals that made the Pirates of the Caribbean movies so sickening to watch.  If you're going to do a movie about angry, bitter southern cannibals who have no inhibitions about offending anyone, then do it right!  I mean, come on, these are supposedly Civil War era southerners and the N-word isn't used once?  To top it off, it isn't even a particularly violent movie!  The gore is before and after implied.  You don't actually see anyone get buzz-sawed, or anyone's face get ripped off.  Whoa, one of the victims is pitchforked.  To use the southern parlance this film crew should be familiar with, it's the coward's way out.  There were some potential spots for  interesting gags, like the idea of two completely moronic blondes outwitting a whole community of bloodthirsty cannibals by mistake.  Too bad the well-thought out ending ruins that.  The lead actors, however, are actually almost good.  Bill Mosley adequately fills Englund's shoes from the first film (the remake, that is).  Why hasn't anyone commented about how his eye patch changed eyes??  Lin Shaye is also good, though a bit over the top in this one.  Her best moment was in that bizarre video clip.  Everything in this is over the top.  The remake proved itself to be an interesting balance between yucks and an underlying menace, not to mention an interesting dig at southern manners.  This film just tries to pile on the yucks.  The victims are easy and obviously in need of their respective comeuppances:  Paris Hilton clones, overachieving British producers, non-colored blacks, gays, erudite Hispanics and stuffed animals.  In other words, the kinds of people who wouldn't be missed by anyone, safe targets.  Again, the cowardly way to ""offend"".",1312070400,,2160,4.895027624309392
4112734,1,B003E1QCZO,"I honestly don't know what to say about this movie. I will say I really enjoyed the original one alot. This one left me speechless it was so bad. There isn't any comparison between the two. The first one is good, this one is not. I do not blame First Look Pictures, and I like some of their films. It is the script. Wow, it was so so bad. Alot of the original actors returned for this sequel, except Robert Englund (SMART MOVE ROBERT. YOU SAW THE SCRIPT AND RAN.lol), but the script was so bad, it made their acting terrible. It is so bad, you really don't want to watch it, making it boring, and you really don't care what happens. I was just wishing it would finish. I have no problems if they come out with a third one, but make it more like the original. Another thing is, alot of the returning character's personalities have changed. The whole film dosen't feel right at all. It dosen't look like they used a big budget for this film either. Low budget would be fine tho, if it were a good movie. This movie is 100 times worse than Cabin Fever 2. I wish people would stop releasing bad sequels to movies. It so unfair for them to make a quick buck thaty way and trick people. This movie isn't even worth $4.00, and I paid $8.70 shipped. I truly feel sorrier tho for the people at Wal-mart and Best Buy that paid $19.99 for this DVD when it first came out.

This is awful...and I agree...there are some shills out there pawning this off as a real movie...about as real as they are!

4112736,1,B003E1QCZO,"I was a big fan of the movie ""2001 Maniacs"" with Robert Englund, I found it to be an amusing mix of gore, comedy, and horror. While based on an older movie, I think the supernatural elements of the story made it far better than the stereotypical ""Deliverance"" inspired killer redneck horror movie.

 The problem with this movie is not just the incredibly low production values, but that they turned this movie into a complete farce rather than trying to make any pretensions of it having any horror in it at all, even in a tertiary manner.

 While a sequel to ""2001 Maniacs"" it doesn't even keep the mythology intact. We go from a group of ghosts haunting a cemetery full of people slaughtered during ""The Civil War"", who can manifest around the time of their deaths each year to claim victims, with each death bringing them closer to being able to pass on, to the ridiculous concept of these same ghosts somehow manifesting permanantly and driving around, pitching tents, and looking for victims.

 Add to this ridiculous sequences like faux-music videos being performed (complete with song and record text in the corner), and it's just not all that entertaining. If you liked the original ""2001 Maniacs"" this is not ""more of the same"" this is just plain out silly... and in a bad way.

 In short, I recommend avoiding this movie like the plague. ""2001 Maniacs"" had some potential to be turned into a decent genere-hybrid franchise, one that could have obtained a decent cult following. This atrocity has pretty much murdered any hopes of that happening.",1288742400,3,1555,4.776119402985074

While it may not have been the breakthrough hit it could have been, 2001 MANIACS has grown a steady cult following in select Horror crowds. Fans of the original will be sorely disappointed with this poor follow-up, however, as the script lacks what little substance the first film may have had in place of an absurd amount of nudity and even cheaper gags. FIELD OF SCREAMS brings back many familiar characters, although several of the leading actors have been replaced (including the role of Mayor Buckman, with Bill Moseley standing in for Robert Englund). These returning characters are only shells of their former selves, written and acted from the gutter with very little humor left to be found in any of the performances. The entire production wreaks of inadequacy, with weak attempts at covering up the film's shortcomings with bloody deaths and nude teens. A sequel this disastrous will likely mean the end for what could have been a fun new splatter series.

Dealing with a studio is simply too much red tape, which he felt lessened the previous film.  I disagree.  I enjoyed the heck out of ""2001 Maniacs."" Sure, it was low-budget, but it had style, gore and a sense of humor.

""Field of Screams"" lacks the necessary budget, writing and direction to even come close to the first effort.  Yet, my biggest problem wasn't the uneven performances, the lackluster picture quality or haphazard writing.  It was the audio.  This has to be the worst film I've had to listen to in over a decade!

As for the plot, it probably helped to take the Southern folks on a field trip since recreating the town might have cost more money than they had.  The problem is that the soon-to-be-victims couldn't act, we couldn't give a crap about them and what they were given to do was so awful that I literally started multi-tasking on other things that needed attention around the living room.

4112759,4,B003E1QCZO,"""Revenge is sweet when you're munching on the meat of a Yankee""

Hard to match the ground-breaking Herschell Gordon Lewis gem from '64 or Tim Sullivan's fun blood-soaked remake from 2005.  Although Sullivan's latest entry is a step back in comparison, it still has enough offensive and fabulously gory good times to make this a worthy addition to the video blood bank.  Let the flesh chomping commence!

Cult horror stud Bill Moseley stars as George W. Buckman.  He steps in for Robert Englund as the mayor of Pleasant Valley, a small Southern town with a violent past.  Buckman actually leads a pack of Confederate ghosts seeking revenge on any and all Northern tourists.  Hungry for blood, this crazed group takes their Traveling Jambouree on the road in search of some fresh Yankee flesh.

They soon meat up in Iowa with a stranded bus full of Road Rascals, a reality show crew from California.  This is an obvious spoof of The Simple Life, and is pretty darn funny.  This group of pretty boys and ditsy models plan to film their show under the fake pretense that they are down in the South.  They obviously get more than they bargained for when they kick it with Buckman and his insane hillbilly squad.

2001 Maniacs Field of Screams has some fairly awesome blood splatter, highlighted by some vicious table saw action.  Good times.  Throw in some nice shots of nudity with a hefty serving of raw unbridled humor, and you've pretty much summed up this low budget affair.  Nothing ground-breaking, but this film is much better than most of the recent, larger budget Hollywood flicks polluting the theaters.  Ignore these bad reviews, grab this instead of the new Halloween 2, Last House on the Left, Friday the 13th, The Amityville Horror, My Bloody Valentine, Nightmare on Elm Street, or The Wolfman.",1280707200,,1804,4.808441558441558
4112760,1,B003E1QCZO,"I cannot believe this film was made by the same people who made 2001 Maniacs.  The first film (the remake, starring Robert Englund), was clever, funny, bloody and ultimately, a lot of fun.  It was a B-movie horror comedy which knew exactly what it was and made for an excellent film for any horror / splatter fan.

This film, 2001 Maniacs: Field of Screams, is, quite frankly, a piece of garbage.  The camera work and direction make it seem like it was made by a high schooler taking his first shot at film making.  The writing is absolutely atrocious.  It isn't funny, it isn't clever, it isn't witty.  It's lame.  The special effects are basically non-existent.  The few scenes which do involve special effects are primitive at best.  The acting is the worst part of this pathetic film.  I understand that this is a B-movie, and it knows it is a B-movie and the acting is supposed to be cheesy, but for acting this terrible, there is no excuse.  The acting in the first one wasn't going to win any academy awards, but it didn't leave you cringing with each horribly performed line of dialogue.

Even Bill Moseley couldn't save this train wreck.  If you enjoyed the first one (as I did), steer clear of this one; you will be severely disappointed.

If you absolutely MUST see this film, I recommend downloading it for free.  That way you won't feel ripped off, and if Tim Sullivan decides to make a third installment, maybe he'll actually put a little bit of effort into it and create something clever and inspired like the first one.",1280275200,,1535,4.5677655677655675
4112761,1,B003E1QCZO,"It's not often at all that I say that a film ""is one of the worst films I've ever seen."" That said, this film is one of the worst films I've ever seen. Everything about it -- and I do mean everything -- is awful. It's not even so ""bad"" it's fun. There isn't an element of the film that I can think of that didn't in some way offend me greatly as a filmgoer, as someone who actually paid good money to see the it.

The film is cheap, and I don't just mean budget-wise. The writing is cheap. Heck, the writing is below cheap. To say it's sophomoric is an insult to sophomoric writers everywhere. The directing is cheap, dreadful and uncreative. The acting is... It was so bad there's no point in even describing it. On the whole, it was like Tim Sullivan and his friends had an extra $58.60 around and decided to make a film. They gathered a lot of ninth-rate fetish show performers and wanna-be actors who were turned down for roles in YouTube fan films, and they were able to blackmail Bill Moseley with something to get him on-board. They collected set pieces from the trash dump after the circus left town, and then they wrote a script on the back of a Waffle House receipt. Yes, it was that offendingly awful and retched.

After watching this contemptible farce of a movie I developed a new appreciation for Uwe Boll and all those Sci Fi Original Motion pictures I used to think were crap.",1280275200,,1392,4.329501915708812
4112762,2,B003E1QCZO,"2001 Maniacs was one of the best horror remakes of all time. Robert Englund as the mayor was priceless and the supporting cast was good. A good mix of cool gore and humor really made it a treat. Then I waited two years or more for them to make a sequel. Boy, I could have waited anther two!

The movie sucks beyond belief, a big let down. The humor is alright but the people they go out and slaughter are really annoying. Bill Mosley is a respected actor among horror movie fans and he did good but the script was poorly written. Granny is back and she did a good job as well but like Mosley, something was off. I didn't care for the rest of the maniacs. In the first movie, they are against blacks and asians but they are in this movie. The gore was cool but there wasn't often in my opinion. Then ending was pretty stupid as well.

Overall, if you enjoyed the first one then you may enjoy this movie. I didn't laugh too much.",1280102400,,927,4.144444444444445

4112774,2,B003E1QCZO,"It's really rare that I turn off a movie before it's finished. It's even more rare that I decide to donate a film right after I buy it. This film has met both criteria on my rare scale. It's really not hard to tell where this film went wrong-everywhere. It's been years since the first film in this series came out and I have to say-that was a humdinger. Inventive kills, over the top humor, just enough offensiveness to be a rocking good time. When I heard that a sequal was in the works I was as happy as a gorehound could be. YOU CRUSHED MY HAPPINESS. While I understand that this was filmed on a limited budget, does it have to so thouroughly look like it? Second of all-what's with the sound? The entire movie seems to be overdubbed(WAY overdubbed) after the fact. I understand a little sweetening here and there but all major dialogue? It's especially jarring when the ""Greek chorus"" (who for some strange reason is not overdubbed) can barely be heard and Granny Boone or the Mayor yells at them to shut up. The offensive, un-pc humor of the first was on a more subtle did-they-really-just-do/say-that vein. No luck here. The maniacs (actually, nearly all the characters) seem to exist merely to spout the most racist put down they can think of. The subtle yet in your face humor of the first is also destroyed completely in this film. It's so heavy handed that I'm sure it was just an afterthought that a pie fight wasn't included. Honestly-what was with Lester toting around a stuffed animal sheep? Did anyone think that was funny? The less said about the acting the better(I'm looking at you Li...no wait-I'm looking at all of you). The gore was good enough but nothing special. That's really all the time I can give this mess. If anyone wants to tell me how it ended-go right ahead (although I 'm not sure I care-just as long as it ended).",1279843200,3,1849,4.505952380952381
4112775,1,B003E1QCZO,"This film is a pathetic excuse for film making. It is boorish, trite and a regurgitation of the same theme over and over ad nauseum. No suspense, no scares etc.. Everything is telegraphed in advance. The film is infantile at best.  The acting is atrocious and amateurish, but what you expect in a low quality film like this. Their attempts at humor in the film border on the childish and moronic. The only humorous thing about this film is that the people involved are so deluded that they think they produced a good piece of work. It is hilarious to think that a film company wasted valuable money in today's economy on a joke of a film.  This dvd isn't worth 11 cents much less 10.99..If you want to get value for your money, buy the original 2000 maniacs film and not these cheap cardborad regurgitations and reimaginings.

4112779,5,B003E1QCZO,"I was fortunate enough to enjo the first American Screening of Tim Sulivan's ""2001 Maniacs: Field of Screams"" at the Dallas Frightmare Weekend in Dallas Texas.

I loved the first film. But this one absolutely exceeded any expectations that I may have had.

The recasting of Bill Moseley immediately brings a whole new level of intensity to the Maniacs. Returning to the Maniacs are Christa Campell, who gets the screen time that she deserved in the first installment (and she gets a couple of scantily clad partners in crime!)along with horror legend Lin Shaye as Granny Boone. The boys from the first installment mostly return, though ladies man Harper Alexander is given whole new heat by the well loved Ogre (Skinny Puppy)

But this is no REPO...(though I did love REPO)

Instead, the kills are much more aggressive-and start almost immediately. But the new adventures on the Maniacs take them on the raod...where they make friends with some reality show types.

What I really want to know is where the hell Katy Marie Johnson came from. She and Asa Hope play off the debutante party girls like they were born for the roles. Katy has a completely freaky resemblence to Paris Hilton. Sometimes to the degree that you think it actually may be Hilton, but then you realzie that Paris Hilton would never be cool enough to appear in this film. Oh, irony.

Even the man candy in this film is hotter. Christopher McDaniel brings some pretty boy back to the Maniacs with his ""brothers""-returning Lester and Hucklebilly.

All in all, this movie was unapolagetically offensive, gratuitiously gorey, and very very well done. Tim Sullivan is a horror genius, and he is not afraid to take chances. He obviously revels in pushing the envelope, and with Field Of Screams, he makes his point. And then some...

Gore, nudity, and hilarity abound in just about every scene, often all at once!  Having been shot in less than two weeks with no budget, this film is clearly no blockbuster-- and it doesn't try to be!  It reminds me of the horror classics, the ones that didn't rely on computer effects or the same plot over and over again.  This film has an amazingly talented cast, a unique and interesting premise, and enough parodies to make you want to count them.  It's a comedy, but still has elements of a social commentary film.  It pokes fun at ALL groups, minorities and majorities, subcultures and the mainstream.  Who could ask for more?  I saw this film at the Texas Frightmare Weekend and loved every minute of it.

8395198,5,B003E1QCZO,"I genuinely don't know who I could ever recommend this movie to because objectively it's horrible in almost every regard. Aside from being horribly offensive to basically anyone, it looks like it was made with a budget of about 5 dollars and the effects are so bad I still can't tell how much of it is actually supposed to be serious. The editing is jarring, the quality of the audio is horrendous and randomly fluctuates between completely fine and incomprehensible, the dialogue is incoherent and makes no sense, and I feel like there are some really basic questions that this movie decides isn't even worth addressing let alone trying to answer, like how a ghost can give birth. But it's okay. I really love Nivek Ogre (Skinny Puppy lead, Repo! the Genetic Opera, Scream Park, etc) and Bill Moseley (Texas Chainsaw 2, House of 1000 Corpses/Devil's Rejects, Repo!, etc) and they're indisputably fantastic in this film and watching their scenes is great. Ogre plays confederate ghost doctor Harper Alexander as a gay dandy who's hanging off of Buckman's (Moseley) every word when he isn't giggling maniacally in a pig mask and murdering innocent yankees and it's a blast to watch, and he's so animated and lively that he alone gives the movie plenty of rewatch value. And just in general, there's some level of bizarre absurdity to this film that makes it so fun to watch over and over. As someone who adores cheap horror and Nivek Ogre and Bill Moseley this is the perfect movie to watch when I'm sad because as ""bad"" as it is it's fun and wild and goofy and there's some genuine.... spirit here, of some sort. It doesn't feel like there was absolutely no effort put forth, it just feels utterly bizarre and wacky. And if you have friends who can stomach it, watching it with them is loads of fun too, because there's plenty to point out and laugh over, whether you're laughing with it or at it. Five stars I genuinely am so glad I own it.",1492387200,,1941,4.628985507246377
8395199,3,B003E1QCZO,"2001 Maniacs was an original, classic film. It had an interesting, well done story, the characters were good, the acting made you feel a little creep out because they did a great job and overall the film was terrifying.

So because the first film was done very well, what else can you do except make a sequel! But as truth be told, the sequel is never as good as the original film (only in some cases the sequel is just as good). 2001 Maniacs: Fields of Screams has the maniacs travel across country because they are forced from their original setting, Pleasant Valley. On the other side of things, a group of people making a reality show is also traveling across country to make their next season (which the main stars are suppose to represent Nicole Richie and Paris Hilton, since this film was released around the time they had their TV show, ""The Simple Life""). When both parties meet, it's turned into a bloody good time!

What separates the original film from it's sequel, is that the original characters missing, there is an absent of actors/actress, the story and plot fall short and it just not enough gruesome deaths like the original.

Some of the characters from the original are not in this film, such as the two guys who played the musical instruments. Instead they give us two totally different characters, that are not as funny as them. There is also the two brothers, which their characters were changed completely, into sub-characters (but don't worry, you still see the one brother's girlfriend, the sheep). They also removed Miss Peaches and the two cousins. But they do give us a few new characters, like a different milk woman, an Asian woman and a different southern bell woman.

They also changed the actors. Frankly, I loved Robert Englund in the original, but when they changed him out for Bill Moseley, it didn't feel like Bill could compare to Robert. Bill Moseley did a good job, don't get me wrong, but the character just didn't feel right and it felt as if the part was only made for Robert Englund. Some of the other maniacs have also changed (like the two brothers and the guy that was the gentleman who took the the girl from the first film on a date). They did manage to keep a few of the same actors like Granny and the little guy who chases kitty (he just grew up more in this film). The Maniacs just felt off in this film with all of the changes.

The story is somewhat interesting, but it's nothing new and original. Frankly, I think if it was kept in Pleasant Valley, it might have been better. Just the factor from the first film and why they stay in Pleasant Valley, doesn't make sense for them to travel across country in this film. Even the factor of the people doing a reality show, is kind of a boring idea, but I get it. Because what else can you do, besides not repeating the original which was college kids on a road trip to Flordia. The whole reality concept though, gets dropped halfway through the film and it becomes they want to shoot a documentary on how the maniacs live. It just gets stale after awhile.

The deaths scenes of the victims in the original was so very well done, that you didn't even care too much that you could tell it looked a little fake. This film, you can tell it's very much fake, but also they aren't that good. We got a bunch of different deaths in the first one, but this second one, some of them you feel like you have seen them in other horror movies. They were also kind of boring.

Despite all these things that I pointed out (without trying to give away too much to either film), 2001 Maniacs: Fields of Screams isn't a terrible film and can still be enjoyable. You just have to look past some of these things. I wouldn't give it a 1 or 2 stars, because it's not that terrible of a film but it will never be the original 2001 Maniacs.",1474934400,,3820,4.425320056899004
