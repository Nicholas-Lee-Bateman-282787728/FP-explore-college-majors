8144268,5,B000I6L712,"I.m on here looking for the next part, my husband and I watched this whole thing in 2 days. We loved it, it is so funny at times and we laughed and laughed. The stories are so good and get better and better. They have such feeling, Hoss is hilarious, the guy who plays him is great. Shelby and Frenchie, you will grow to love with each episode. I just love this series and I'm a Bonanza fan.",1354492800,3,391,4.0256410256410255

8144270,5,B000I6L712,This may have disappointed some dyehard Bonanza fans but I found this to be an endearing story of a good and honorable father trying to raise three boys into good men though the charactors may not be as many imagined they might if you stuck with the series they became believable I only wish the remainder of the episodes would be released this set contains only the first ten hope all of these fine actors are doing well in their new endeavors.,1347580800,7,445,4.439024390243903
