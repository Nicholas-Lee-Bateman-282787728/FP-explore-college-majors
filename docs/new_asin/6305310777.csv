1011806,5,6305310777,"Hwang, one of the premiere leg men in the history of the martial arts genre, is at his best in Hit Man in the Hand of Buddha. This film includes the usual fantastic leg work from Hwang, but also some of the better stick-fighting scenes I have ever seen. True fans of the genre should sit back and enjoy the work of one of the true greats to ever grace the martial arts screen. Well worth the watch, although I would recommend finding a copy with subtitles rather than the dubbed English.",1055116800,,487,4.304347826086956
1011807,5,6305310777,"Hwang plays the hero in this movie and displays his awesome kicking abilities. This movies' got allot of fight sequences and should be a part of your Martial Arts movie library, but the DVD should be better. The Martial Arts Theater Collection are all in full screen format. The movie is clear and watch able with some dirt, specks, and lines through the film, but not enough to bother you. The DVD should be in Wide screen and it is not, no extra futures are available and it is only in the annoying English sound track, if you like that it's ok I guess. I brought the movie already, so if a better version is released, I guess I'll get rid of this one. The English dubbed version just drives me crazy because of the way it sounds and the little Ocean Shores logo that pops out during the first chapter of the movie along with a copyright message in the middle of the ... movie ... me off. My opinion is if you collect DVDs for their fullest potential like Extra fetures, origianale and multiple sound tracks, and Original Widescreen format skip the MARTIAL ARTS THEATER COLLECTION. Trust my reviews I have 60 Martial arts DVDs and some of the companies I buy from make these old school and new school Kung Fu flicks look Excellent.",1020902400,,1233,4.436123348017621

7887968,3,6305310777,"Dubbed in English. The kung-fu choreography is good, but the story is mediocre.  A guy comes into town in search of his sister and brother-in-law.  The brother-in-law is a gambler and doesn't bother working, so this new guy in town takes up the job.  This new guy is demonstrated as a morally good guy and befriends a hobo who has a gang of children trained to pick-pocket people.  He learns from the hobo who the bad guys are who were trying to assassinate his family because the brother-in-law owes them money.  Not able to fight off the bad guys, the hobo recommends the guy to learn kung-fu at a Shaolin Buddhist Temple.  When he returns, he receives devastating news of his family and he seeks revenge.",1491436800,,707,4.571428571428571

7887972,5,6305310777,Hwang Jang Lee is the hero in this film. He has plenty of sreen time unlike in other movies he is in. I haven't seen all of his movies but this is the first one I have seen where his foes are evenly matched with his skills. In other movies it's plain to see that he is far better than his opponent and when he looses it's hard to believe. A really great film. A must have for any kung fu fan.,1337212800,,392,3.792682926829268
7887973,1,6305310777,"I don't see how this movie got good reviews. This was one of the corniest kung fu films I've ever seen. The fighting is corny, the plot is corny, the editing is just terrible. Everything stinks about this movie. I didn't even watch it twice. Omg its terrible. Not even worth a watch.",1219017600,,283,4.3584905660377355
7887974,5,6305310777,"An absolute must for fans of the great Hwang Jang Lee(and how can you not be?), Hit Man In The Hand Of Buddha is possibly the ""king of the superkickers"" finest moment... oddly enough though, it's due more in part to the amount of his screen time rather then the actual movie itself.  The film features plenty of the usual trappings of martial arts cinema from the era(most notably the protagonist being beaten and nearly killed before heading to the Shaolin temple for training before the inevitable rematch), but what really makes this film such a joy is seeing Hwang in the role of hero for once.  Up until this point(and ever since I believe?) he had only played the part of villian(most notably in The Drunken Master, Secret Rivals 1 and 2, and Snake In The Eagles Shadow) to which the opposing lead could always expect a near battle to the death from.  So all it took for Hwang to finally get the role as a good guy... write, direct, and produce his own film of course(?!).  The fact that he's a tad unconvincing in the role(although he does lose his trademark mustache... oh, you didn't know facial hair was evil?  LOL!) isn't the important thing, the important thig is that it's a complete movie revolving aroung Hwang Jang Lee with every fight featuring him doing what he does best... booting goons in the head!  An excellent cast(including Eddy Ko, Tino Wong, and Mei Sheng Fan), great musical score, plenty of old school intricate choreography, and Hwang as a hero make this a true gem of any self-respecting Kung Fu fans collection.  The DVD from Tai Seng is typical... full-screen and featuring no special features or original language/subtitle options, though the picture is actually pretty clean and the vocal dub track is solid as well.",1207958400,3,1751,4.7026143790849675
7887975,3,6305310777,"This was an okay flick - surely not included in my top 5%.  The Martial Arts Theater copy had very poor sound quality - far too low and very crappy for a DVD.  Maybe I got a bad copy - who knows.

Pretty okay fighting scenes - I've seen much better.  The plot was simple to follow and also very predictable.  Overall, this is a decent flick to add to your old school Kung Fu collection.",1125100800,,386,4.026315789473684
7887976,4,6305310777,"This was a good movie, because it wasn't boring at all. Even with it slow beginning. But the end gets it's props. I like this movie as well, because it had meaning to. This was an ok movie. I'm buying more as we speak.",1058400000,,218,3.977272727272727
