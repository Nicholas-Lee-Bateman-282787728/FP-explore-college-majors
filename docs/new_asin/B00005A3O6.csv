But as I put it into my xbox, it told me that I couldn't watch it on there, so I put it on my laptop and it told me I need to be in region 4 or region 2 to be able to watch it. I do not understand what it meant by that, I am very disappointed, it should have said that in the description.",1406419200,,383,3.413793103448276

1411309,2,B00005A3O6,"The first movie was better... this one... has some good visuals, but the story feels a bit made up on how they save the world and... I guess I won't say too much to spoil the movie. But this movie... I keep on checking when the movie will end...",1482278400,,245,4.020408163265306

1411328,3,B00005A3O6,The movie is a fine movie. I rented this one for my 5 year old but he really couldn't get into it. He loved mew two strikes back and understood the emotion a lot more and could appreciate the movie. This one is more talk of legends and things that aren't really addressed too much in the tv show its more aimed for older kids or adults that know more about Pokmon and the legendary birds. Worth the rent if your a Pokmon fan I don't think I would actually buy this one though.,1474848000,2,476,4.074468085106383

I took a star off because I'm a little annoyed the kids didn't ask me if they could watch this movie.  My wife may have let them order it but, still I get the email from Amazon in my inbox.  Not her.
