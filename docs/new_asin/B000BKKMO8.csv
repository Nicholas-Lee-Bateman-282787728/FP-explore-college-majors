8087990,4,B000BKKMO8,"Really got into the PGA championship in the late 1990's.  This was one of the less memorable tournaments during that time period, but the video was a good summary of the weekend in the Pacific northwest.",1468454400,,203,4.638888888888889
8087991,5,B000BKKMO8,"It was the last major championship of the 1900s...played on the longest course ever to host a Grand Slam event.  It attracted the strongest international field of the year...and what it produced was the kind of nail-biting, down-to-the-wire drama that has made the PGA Championship golf's annual cliffhanger classic.

When 150 of the world's best professional golfers assembled at Chicago's Medinah #3 course for the 81st PGA Championship, the man to beat was Tiger Woods, ranked No. 1 in the world with three victories in his previous four starts.  And when the final putt hit the hole on Sunday, the man who stroked it was Woods, winning, at age 23, the second major professional championship of his career.

His first title - the 1997 Masters - had come by a whopping 12 strokes - but this victory was not as easy.  Tiger Tames Medinah is the story of how he triumphed over the course, the elements, and Sergio Garcia, the brilliant young challenger who came at him in the eleventh hour.

Tiger finished round one with birdies on both 17 and 18, but still found himself four strokes off the pace set by Garcia, the 19-year-old Spanish prodigy, playing in his first PGA Championship.  Then, when Garcia faded on day two, Tiger came on, firing a 67 despite heavy rain throughout his final holes.  He followed that with a 68 on Saturday to share the top spot with Canada's best player Mike Weir.  Then on Sunday, just when Tiger seemed to have blitzed the field with a five-stroke lead, young Garcia rose again to challenge him in an unforgettable battle, to the wire.

Tiger Tames Medinah captures every significant drive, approach, pitch and putt in this, the grand finale of the Grand Slam for 1999.",1145404800,,1702,4.738983050847458
