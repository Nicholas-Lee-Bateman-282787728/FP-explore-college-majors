Pero si quieren ver un CONCIERTAZO, compren Ana Gabriel en la Plaza de Toros Mxico (woooooow) ! En estos conciertos no canta muchas originales. :-/",1410912000,,243,4.4222222222222225

5528680,5,B00AYJBSVW,Excellent concert -  I Love Ana Gabriel!  She is a Magnificat singer.  With this DVD you get 2 concerts for the price of one.,1381536000,4,125,4.125
5528681,3,B00AYJBSVW,"The concert itself was quite good. My main complaint was that Ms. Gabriel spends too much time signing autographs while onstage slowing the show and making it boring for the viewer.  Also, i'm surprised the artist and her team did not attempt to correct the video flaws (as in the Alas atadas song) before putting this Blue Ray out on the market.  In this day and age these video flaws are totally inexcusable!!",1375747200,,411,4.616438356164384

5528683,5,B00AYJBSVW,I am defintely biased when it comes to Ana Gabriel. I have been totally infatuated with her voice for years. And it was great to hear and see that she is still the great Mexican diva.,1366156800,3,183,4.111111111111111
5528684,4,B00AYJBSVW,"Four stars only for the reasons behind this concert, and for all the extra effort and professionalism that Ana invested in this event, which is demonstrated every time she in front of her audience and this was no exception.  However, the audience here is disengaged; only -one way communication-.  When Ana tries to engage and communicate this or that information about certain songs or the emotions that she is feeling on that night the audience just ignores her attempts, and doesn't allow this to happen.  Either, they love her a lot (as they just continue screaming), or they just don't care of what Ana has to say.  Looks like the audience just expect her to do one thing - to sing non-stop.
The entire show unfolds without major highlights.  This event was free of charge for those who attended, Ana and her team went out of their way to make this happen, and it was well prepared and with plenty of anticipation from what I heard.  So I kind of expected this to be a ""very"" memorable and unique event.  However, I found it a little monotonous.  This DVD is split in two sections: The first half Ana sings the usual pop stuff, and the other half is supposed to be dedicated to the Mariachi genre.  The selection of the Mariachi songs was not the best in my opinion. Ana's Rancheras repertorie is way richer and with better choices for this type of celebration.  Other than the mandatory big hit ""es demasiado tarde"", and ""guitarra mia"" no other big or more interesting songs are included.  Also, I noticed the mariachi group very seldom plays by itself to stand out and show off that Mexican flavor or for one to identify the unique Mariachi sound.  They compounded native rythms and drums in the begining of the Mariachi half, then added Banda instruments for sounds typical of Sinaloa, and yes there are the mariachi elements that play on and off in the background.  Either they play partially or are overshadowed with the addition of other instruments or synthetizers on most of the songs, and so the Mariachi half is not entirely Mariachi just to clarify as I bought this DVD based on that belief.  The package is still a good treat for the price and the time of recorded material in it from this magnificent artist; at almost three hours; way more generous than what other artists are used to give to their fans on released DVD's.",1365724800,10,2341,4.609638554216867

8559269,5,B00AYJBSVW,"Ana Gabriel is just perfect in this double concert. Honestly, I don't understand why some people say this concert is boring!, I can't believe it. Were they expecting something like a Katy Perry concert???? Ana Gabriel looks so happy and comfortable the whole show, interacting with her fans, signing autographs even taking selfies with them. Her performance itself is awesome in both concerts, Don't hesitate to buy this double concert DVD, if you like Ana Gabriel you will be happy to have it,. trust me, and I'm not her biggest fan, but I like her songs. Do yourself a favor and buy this DVD",1447200000,,593,4.711538461538462
