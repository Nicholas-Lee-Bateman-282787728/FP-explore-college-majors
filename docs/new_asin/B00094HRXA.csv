8057184,4,B00094HRXA,"This well photographed episode of Nature shows the life history of the salmon told mostly from the perspective of the fish.  It is about as close to wildlife as a documentary can get.  Although it is not currently available on DVD, the VHS tape is of good quality, and it is quite inexpensive.  The older episodes of  Nature are hard to find, but here some of the best episodes are available and well worth getting for the content. Since it began its broadcast on PBS over twenty-five years ago, Nature has been one of the most artful of all of the wildlife documentaries.  Perhaps someday these beautiful programs from the beginning of the series will be restored and released on DVD.",1219536000,,685,4.628099173553719
