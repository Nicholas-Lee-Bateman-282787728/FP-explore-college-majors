8741944,5,B018AXRNM6,"On the borderline between child and adult, crossing from reality to the world of beyond the real, this is a story that makes sense within the story, and has solid, real emotions and avoids the common boys and girls theme in favor of a theme where all are real people.

One character is not a ""real people,"" and that is what drives the story, a tale dealing with having a wish come true and the ramifications of that when reality intrudes.  Easily safe for even the youngest of likely viewers, it plays with a level of story that is aimed at the adults watching it, and that teases the younger viewers with a story behind the story they watch, and one that will withstand repeated viewings.

Even so, it really does not make sense.  Even so, it is a top notch story.",1535932800,,765,4.366197183098592
8741945,5,B018AXRNM6,I really got to liking the characters. A very good story and a nice balance of humor and drama. I'd like to see more of this story but it really is complete pretty much as is. I'd still enjoy more:),1504656000,,198,3.975
8741946,5,B018AXRNM6,"Celestial Method (Sora no Method) is a great anime. For those who do not know it was released late 2014 as Sora No Method and for some reason kind of slipped away from popularity and went unnoticed in the West. Voice actors really hit their mark on this one too, Characters really come to life, especially our star girls Nonaka and Noel.
Art in Celestial Method is beautiful and songs are catchy and fit very well.
Plot is interesting and unique. Setting is ""Kiriya Lake""; which in real life is, Lake Tya, a huge Crater Lake in Hokkaido Japan. Known Worldwide for the ""2008 G8 Summit"" and in the anime shows them leaving a building with ""Hokkaido G8 Summit"" written on it.
Ending is great as well and full of wonderful characters. 9/10

Total sleeper hit here :)",1493424000,2,762,4.521739130434782
