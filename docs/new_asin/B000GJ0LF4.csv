2614511,4,B000GJ0LF4,This series of cartoon from the UK were terrific for the first 3 or 4 seasons. This last two seasons are not indicative of the excellent story lines and animation of the earlier series. But they are a must for the collector. Please watch them in small doses of 3 or 4 episodes.,1167782400,2,277,4.245283018867925
2614512,4,B000GJ0LF4,"I watched Danger Mouse when it was on TV (20 years ago).  I bought this set to get some of my old favorite episode.

It is a ""British Humor"" cartoon, Monty Python era (not Wallace and Gromit). You either get it or you don't.  My kids (4 and 6) love it, but my wife thinks it is silly.",1167782400,,284,3.8620689655172415
2614513,5,B000GJ0LF4,Well this is the final DVD in the series.  All 21 episodes from series 9 and 10.  The episodes go for about 25 minutes and disk 2 is in Dolby Surround Sound.  Thats if your or DVD is hooked up to a Hi-Fi unit.  Since the episodes were made in the 1990's the picture is very clear and good too watch.  I won't tell about the last episode you have to find out for yourself.  There was rumours of Dangermouse comming back but I haven't heard anything else.  If your get it.  Enjoy the last 21 episodes of the BEST cartoon series ever.,1162771200,3,531,4.087378640776699

8133054,5,B000GJ0LF4,"Here we are at the end of the road.  My other favorite of the Danger Mouse sets.  For these seasons, they introduced a new format, single 20 minute stories.  Of the 21 episodes here, only 2 are 11 minute episodes, but most of the time these episodes are every bit as good as the season 6 ones.  Here's a review of each, with synopsizes from the box.

69.  Danger Mouse on the Orient Express:  All aboard!  Penfold & Danger Mouse ride the Orient Express.  A great start to the set.  A+

70.  The Ultra Secret Secret:  Danger Mouse and Greenback team up to rid the Earth of unwanted pests.  But is it just a ruse?  Not the best, but not bad.  B

71.  Duckula Meets Frankenstoat:  Duckula and Frankenstoat breed robot vampoids.  Duckula's final episode is also his finest.  A+

72.  Where There's a Well There's a Way:  Merlin's magic ink well holds the power to grant wishes.  Some really funny moments here.  A-

73.  All Fall Down:  Watch out for world-shattering devices.  This episode has 2 of the best one-shot villains in the whole show.  A

74.  Turn Of the Tide:  A scrap yard on the moon causes massive floods.  A good end to the seventh season.  A

75.  Gremlin Alert:  A gremlin blocks out the sun.  The first episode of season 8 returns to the 11 minute format, & it is great.  A

76.  Cor!  What a Picture!:  Greenback invents a machine that can control people when it possesses a photograph of them.  The last episode of season 8 (short season, wasn't it?) is also the last 11 minute episode, & it's one of the better ones.  A

77.  I Spy With My Little Eye...: That the polar ice is melting!  Despite reusing a plot this is a great episode to start off season 9.  A

78.  Bigfoot Falls:  Danger Mouse and Penfold investigate carnage caused by a monster with huge feet.  Another great episode.  A

79.  The Statue of Liberty Caper:  How do buildings disappear?  Again, despite a recycled plot, but this time the story is even better than the original, thank in some part to Penfold's aunt, one of the funniest characters on the show.  A+

80.  Penfold Transformed:  The new villain Professor Crumhorn creates a robot doppleganger of Penfold.  Crumhorn may just be my favorite villain on the show; 3 of his 4 episodes are hilarious.  A+

81.  A Dune With a View:  Never run out of gas in the Sahara Desert.  Not the best but it's still pretty good.  It's worth it just to hear Danger Mouse's single greatest pun in the series.  B+

82.  Don Coyote and Sancho Penfold:  A crazy coyote kidnaps Penfold.  This is one of the funniest episodes, even the ending which I thought would be a lame cop-out turned out to be just as hilarious as what came before it.  A+

83.  Crumhorn Strikes Back!:  A little girl + Danger Mouse + Fort Knox spell trouble.  This is the worst episode of the series, and a terrible start to the tenth and final season.  There are some funny moments, but seeing Crumhorn turn into a little girl is just so disturbing, and it's even worse when- well, I better not spoil it for you.  D

84.  Ants, Trees and... Whoops-A-Daisy:  What is Penfold's aunt doing in the amazon jungle?  To make up for that last one, we get one of my all-time favorite episodes, as well as the better of the 2 with Penfold's aunt.  A+

85.  There's a Penfold In My Suit:  Penfold tries on Danger Mouse's suit - and can't get it off!  This is the greatest body swapping episode I have ever seen, apart from the one in The Tick.  A+

86.  Rhyme And Punishment: Ka-zonk go Danger Mouse and Penfold into a dimension where nothing makes sense.  These kinds of episodes are always hilarious, but Crumhorn's presence makes this my favorite one.  A+

87.  Pillow Fright!:  Remote-control, allergy inducing pillows are coming to smother England!  Some funny moments, but not my favorite.  C+

88.  Heavy Duty:  Land sharks invade London.  Crumhorn's in this one, what else can I say?  A+

89.  The Intergalactic 147:  Earth is the next target in a massive snooker game.  One of my least favorite episodes.  There are some funny moments, but the atmosphere is a bit too serious, and the cliffhanger at the end ruins it for me, since it will never be solved.  C-

So there you have it.  A mostly great end to a great show.  If you have the other sets, this is a must buy.  My family likes this show (or parts of it at least) & they all agree that this & the set before this have their most of favorite episodes on them.",1368835200,,4413,4.377972465581977
8133055,4,B000GJ0LF4,"I loved this series growing up! Huge fan of the British humor. It's good ole DM, but not quite as good as earlier seasons.",1301356800,,122,4.125
8133056,2,B000GJ0LF4,"I watched DM on Nickelodeon growing up, but I had forgotten that they ""new and improved"" it in the final seasons. The format is longer, the witty, dry narrator is all but gone, and DM and Penfold spend WAY too much time yakking. If you want the true essence of DM, stick with the earlier seasons. But, if you're a die-hard fan, or if you have small children, it's a must-have I suppose.",1204070400,4,386,4.301369863013699

8133059,5,B000GJ0LF4,"If you love to laugh and can interpret the British humor, this is a must own. A cross between James Bond and Secret Squirrel. All ages in our family sit and enjoy episode after episode and laugh themselves into tears with the missions of Danger Mouse.

If you would like good, clean fun and enjoyment, Danger Mouse has to be high on your list.",1167868800,5,343,4.359375
