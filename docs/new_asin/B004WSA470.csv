8445652,3,B004WSA470,"This film takes place in the same time period as the first one but has a different Ninja hero. If you are like me, you got ""attached"" to our blue eyed short skirt Ninja only to find she was been replaced by Kaede. The Lord who was attempting to unite Japan has been killed and an evil lord has taken over killing those loyal to the old Lord. Kaede is to gather information using her womanly charms and ability to quickly heal after a bamboo caning. There is a quest for the incantation to use the magical Zanshuken sword from India.

8445655,5,B004WSA470,"Memoirs of a Lady Ninja 2 is not a sequel but is an original film with a new title character and actress. Kaede is kunoichi, female ninja, and is tasked to help find Lord Tokugawa and protect him from the agents of Akechi. This warlord fought against Nobunaga's forces and is now hunting down the generals. The villain is one of Akechi's men, a lord Bayek, who wants a sword in Tokugawa's possession. Kaede does battle a couple times with these men and is aided by a traveling musician named Kagetomo. This guy is secretly the son of a warrior priest that both Tokugawa and Bayek want to find as the priest is the only one that knows the words of power to activate the enchanted blade. The film is low budget and some scenes can be overlong but the story is surprisingly good as well as the acting of the principals. A few scenes that border on nc-17 and low violence as no blood is ever seen even during the sword battles. The ending is entertaining as Kaede wields the enchanted sword against both bands of bad guys. Yes, there are two groups of baddies that our heroine must contend with. All told this is an enjoyable film for Japanese film lovers and clocks in at 82 minutes. A third film with both lady ninjas from both films would be great.",1383609600,2,1247,4.379310344827586
8445656,4,B004WSA470,"I liked Memoirs of a Lady Ninja 2. Unlike some other female ninja movies from Japan I've seen, this movie has some pretty decent fight scenes. It's not on the level of Hong Kong fight scenes, but it's still pretty good. Plus this flick has sex and nudity in it which is always good.",1373846400,3,282,4.2407407407407405
