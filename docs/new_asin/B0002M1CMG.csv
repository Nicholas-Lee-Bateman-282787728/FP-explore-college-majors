8028986,1,B0002M1CMG,I have watched this numerous times & it's ridiculously STOOPID! The camera work is a joke & could have been recorded on a cell phone at the time for better quality. Also the cameos by Carrot Top & former UFC light Heavyweight Champion Rashad Evans adds to the goofiness of the movie. I can't believe the director was allowed to do sequels after this. The only good thing on the movie is the speech by Tony Tomahawk which turns out being in the deleted scenes. In the scene Tony teaches Toro about the streets in a weird but sense making analogy about lions & sebras....,1355270400,,569,4.428571428571429
8028987,1,B0002M1CMG,"You know, I saw ""Mi Vida Loca"" and I enjoyed it. So when I went to rent some DVDs I saw ""Locas 4 Life"" and thought it would be similiar. Well, let me tell you, I was tricked. This movie is about a gang of  3 floozies and a lesbian who want to walk around NYC like they're hard or something. They're supposed to be hard core gangstas but all they do is steal incense, rob convenience stories, and rob the men that they screw. The lesbian, Toro, doesn't screw any guys at all and she's too infatuated with some chick who isn't part of the gang. Toro's crew doesn't even like her lover.  In fact that's what the movie is mainly about: a lesbian romance. There was no mention of that on the back of the DVD case. What makes it worse was that I was watching this with my family and they asked me, ""Why did you get this? What's up with you?"" How was I supposed to know?!  Anyway, Toro  thought she was gangsta and could whip out a gun on the ex-boyfriend of the girl she was in love with. Toro got what she deserved at the end of the movie; you want to step into a man's world, you'll go out like one. I didn't like how the movie was shot and the only unforgettable character is Toro. If you want to learn more about female gangs, this is not the movie to watch.",1119830400,3,1256,4.032128514056225

Shot on Video somewhere in The Bronx i was shocked at how at first i was very distracted by the ""video look"" and the really low-budget style of shooting, but I really got hooked afetr a bit and thought it was very cool.",1089763200,5,301,4.033333333333333
