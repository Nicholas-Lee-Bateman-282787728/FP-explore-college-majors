5463671,4,B00AP2DAX2,"Refugio para el Amor (Shelter for Love - 925 minutes)

This one toys with incestuous situations: Father/daughter; brother/sister, but it's a good Catholic telenovela, so it only threatens them.

Our sweet virginal heroine Luciana (Zuria Vega) meets a couple of wealthy brothers on the dirt road near her father's field. Papa's tractor has broken down and they promise to send help, but they forget.

She is threatened by a wealthy, much older man in her village, so after her father dies, she kisses her mother goodbye and goes to the city to seek her fortune. She stays with her cousin, who has pretended to be a nurse to her family back in the village, but is actually a waitress at a sleazy club called ""Inferno."" She gets our sweet young thing a job there, too.

When a nasty patron tries to abuse her, Rodrigo (Gabriel Soto), one of those wealthy brothers, springs to her aid. The other brother Patricio (Brandon Peniche) is a paraplegic from a recent mountain-climbing accident. Rodrigo doesn't recognize her but when she gets a job as a maid in his parents' house, she knows him instantly.

Both brothers fall in love with her but their mother Roselena (Laura Flores) sees her resemblance to a woman whose baby she gave away when the woman died 18 years ago. Mom takes an instant dislike to her and makes her life miserable.

Evil plotting, religious fervor, a kidnapped newborn baby, brain tumors, money laundering, mental illness and a sunny heroine all add to the fun. In addition, the evil women who have made life miserable come to equally miserable ends! Very satisfying. Amazon has this with English captions (which I need).",1378684800,6,1638,4.790780141843972

5463675,4,B00AP2DAX2,I love this novela and purchased it because there were some episodes I missed when it ran on TV.

5463678,4,B00AP2DAX2,"Ordene esta Telenovela En DVD. Tengo muchisimas ganas de verla, espero que el Resumen valga la pena y este bien editado. La Historia se me hizo muy interesante y ademas cuenta con un buen Elenco.
La Duracin del DVD esta exelente, al parecer Contiene Ms de 15 Horas, al menos en la Portada expecifica eso.
De momento la que tengo ms ansias de tener es Amor Bravio, la espero hace meses, espero que sea la proxima que salga a la venta. Me muero de ganas de tenerla ya. Me Encanta esa Telenovela.
Review/Comentario: Me Gusto Mucho el DVD, excepto algunos detalles/escenas que faltan como por ejemplo el Final de Lastra/Claudio Baez, algunas partes de Gala y de Brigida en contra de Luciana pero bueno, asi y todo vale la pena tenerla.",1364688000,3,731,4.587786259541985
5463679,5,B00AP2DAX2,"Ever since I was a child, I've had best friends who were South American or European. They all told me they learned English by watching T.V. Later, as a teacher, all my foreign students told me the same thing. I learned French along with English, but I never practiced my Spanish, which I began hearing at age 3, when I moved to California. I eventually got a PhD in French and a Master's in Spanish, but, again, I didn't practice the Spanish. Now, 40 years later, I found myself with a job teaching Spanish I to College students. I was desperate, so I took it, but I really couldn't speak. Now, 5 months later, in Spanish II, I find that whole blocks of the language are falling together in my head. I dream in fluent Spanish, and I am getting quite fluent in class. The reason? I have been listening to telenovelas 3 hours a night, while I bicycle. I find that if I listen to the words, I don't understand them. Subtitles completely thow me, but, if I just relax and bicycle, I understand every word and pick up expressions, vocabulary and whole sentences each time I listen. The grammar book I'm teaching makes me recognize new phrases every day. It's really exciting! Refugio del Amor is one of the better telenovelas. I've also enjoyed Amor Bravio, cuando mando el amor, and Amores verdaderos, neither of which is yet available of DVD. I am looking forward to that, because I like to listen over and over again.",1364688000,10,1415,4.488372093023256

8555625,5,B00AP2DAX2,"With good writing, solid acting (which gets better as the series progresses), and good production values, this weeper will keep you distracted from the elections, health care woes, and life generally. It's just what you needed. The knowing play with soap opera conventions provides occasional comic relief. The baddies are especially fun to watch and seem to be having a blast playing their parts. It's a good Catholic novela--but with a twist. And someone needs to explain the short last scene.

It's a little slow to start but will not let you go after disco 1.",1459382400,,563,4.864583333333333
