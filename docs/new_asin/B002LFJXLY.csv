3945916,2,B002LFJXLY,"This was sooooooooooooooooo boring. First off, it only shows 1 book signing-all you see is Michael sitting in a music store in N.Y. for over an hour signing and signing and its soooooooooooo boring. You can tell he's not into it. And it's November of 2001 so 9/11 just happened. When the camera pans outside to fans, you can see the busted out windows of nearby buildings. I didn't like this DVD and wish I hadn't have ordered it. I would have much rather have seen Michael Jackson on tour somewhere other than what he was doing in N.Y. Not a good timing for him.",1261699200,,563,4.371428571428571
3945917,5,B002LFJXLY,"i really liked this dvd - i got it as a part of the mega-box set i received the other day!

my favorite part was seeing mj at his store signing at virgin records for his invincible album -  the reporter was constantly interviewing fans and asking them how they felt after just meeting mj for the first time - most of them had spent the night outside the night before to go in and meet him the next day - some of them did dance moves, some of them were crying and some were speechless. mj gave out handshakes and hugs and signatures. there was a child dressed up as mj in a shiny top and sunglasses who had a glove on, too -mj got pictures with him and picked him up to stand him on the table next to him - that was really cool. i really wish i could have met him myself - i would have definitely been one of the people asking for a hug! he seems like he had such a cool sense of humor and was so gentle.

i also liked when he was answering the questions of some of the fans in by the computers.

all of it was really good - there was a christmas speech made and also a statement about the allegations made by mj. that was very good.

i recommend this dvd - but i'm glad i got it in my mega-box set since it was cheaper that way.",1259020800,16,1228,3.8764940239043826
3945918,4,B002LFJXLY,"Since my first comment on these DVDs, I have purchased them and enjoyed them. In the booklet that came with it there is a page about the seance, this time I cut it out at another reviewer's suggestion. That way I was able to enjoy the rest of the disc. And, I like it very much. So I recommend it for these reasons. There is no occult content on the disc itself.

This what I first wrote:
""Be warned this unauthorized CD says it has a seance on it and is using a Ouija board to ask MJ questions. After reading these notes on the cover, I sent it back unopened. If I had known this, I would not have ordered it.

MJ was against this kind of thing based on his religious convictions. Jehovah's Witnesses believe people cease to exist when they die, but will be raised later and that is what the Bible really says also. I am exceedingly sad that Michael Jackson has died and I wish every day it was not so, but this is no comfort. One day we will see MJ again, but not now.""",1258416000,11,971,4.0785340314136125

Since there were no reviews on here yet I thought I'd give some brief information on the DVD. The back of the case says:

""Press Conferences and Store Signings is a 2 hour DVD programme showing Michael Jackson, the world's biggest superstar at store signings, press conferences and much, much more!

Presented together here for the first time, adored by millions of fans worldwide this is a must for any true fan, contains a 32 page, 12,000 word booklet - The King of Pop, a tribute biography/discography which includes the Staples Center memorial in Los Angeles AND a seance transcript where Michael is asked questions that were responded to using a Ouija board, a fasinating connection that will bring peace of mind to many of Michael's fans.""

It's really nice in this to see people telling Michael what he meant to them and his reactions to this! I really wish I'd got to meet him myself, he seems like such a great, loving person.",1257811200,45,1760,7.607843137254902
8372679,5,B002LFJXLY,Wish there was more footage but overall I am pleased. Anything that has Michael in it makes me happy.,1502323200,,101,4.368421052631579
8372680,3,B002LFJXLY,It was interesting /intriguing/ disturbing ... you'll see Michael in a good and not so good light. There is extended footage of MJ engaging with his fans at a cd signing that many will find enjoyable.,1486598400,,200,4.583333333333333
8372681,2,B002LFJXLY,This was more documentary than entertaining.  I didn't like it and gave it away.,1471651200,,80,4.714285714285714
8372682,5,B002LFJXLY,I like anything that shows a happy MJ. That's the MJ I want to remember.,1408406400,,72,3.8666666666666667
8372683,4,B002LFJXLY,"I felt I was well informed prior to my purchase thanks to the other reviewers.  Among the many footages in this DVD, I enjoyed the Invincible cd signings the most because it was neat seeing MJ interacting with his fans.  I would have preferred no interuptions in that footage (like the reporter interviewing some fans or fan comments outside), but I guess it was televised that way.  If there was something I would add to this DVD it would be subtitles.  I loved the two postcards included, the booklet had nice photos, and the inner cover jumped out at me, in a good way:)",1313452800,3,573,4.480769230769231
8372684,3,B002LFJXLY,"Overall, I enjoyed the video but was surprised that it did not offer more film of MJ's interactions with the press. I enjoyed seeing MJ interact with fans. However, it gets confusing to understand what is going on due to the lack of information at the start of each segment to detail the date, place and relevance to MJ's career.  Sequencing the segments in chronological order could have made it a more compelling presentation.

The following offers a description and summary of some scenes:

The first hour (and a bit more) shows his ""Invincible"" CD signing and promotion at the Virgen Megastore in NYC. The breif interviews with individual fans were sometimes interesting, but also distracting. I found myself wanting them to cut back to MJ at times.

I enjoyed most of his direct encounters with the fans. In one interaction, MJ is seen hugging a blond girl with long hair. He asks her, ""Did you write it down?"" and then, ""The number,"" in response to someone off camera. His companion (one of the Cascios?) was hiding his face behind a magazine; it was difficult to determine if MJ himself wanted the young woman's number, or was getting it for the companion seated next to him.

During another moment, a young woman with long, dark hair wearing a flirty midriff bearing shirt responded to MJ's question, 'What's that?"" by coyly raising her shirt more. He then leaned in closer to her looking at what appeared to be a Playboy bunny sparkling decoration pierced to her belly button.

Next, there's a press conference on the History Tour. Lots of high-pierced screaming that goes on for most of it in the background. MJ looks very nice in his jacket with a jeweled star-patch and crown above it on his left jacket sleeve. Then, a Tower Records appearance for about 5 minutes. MJ makes a quick speech: ""Thank you for having me, "" and goes through a giggling episode! LOL! The fans sing a chorus of 'You Are Not Alone"". He allows the officials to take an imprint of his hand for a plaque of some kind.

Next, we see the front of the Hotel George V, London. We watch fans out front behind rope barriers holding banners. One strange message on a banner: 'Welcome Home Doo-Doo"".

They engage in sing-a-longs, starting with the song, 'Scream"", then ""Earth Song"". Some fans held up images of Charlie Chaplin, which was sweet. The police on site start really pushing these people back. Soon, they all chant, 'MICHAEL! MICHAEL!"" and MJ shows up in a van, with a black mask, tuxedo pants and a very casual jacket. It looks almost like he did not expect to have so many people waiting to see him. He runs inside quickly. Soon, he is up on the hotel roof, holding up each of the flags: the American then the Union Jack. Then, he points to something out towards the crowd and leaves the rooftop. Time passes; MJ appears again, gets closer to the fans and touches some hands. It gets so chaotic and the screaming is eardrum splitting. I had to mute the sound!! The next scene, he seems to be in a store. Maybe Disney?  He goes out and moves through the crowd. It's evening; he is now wearing a nice, red shirt. MJ shakes some hands, children approach; a girl hugs him. Kids step forward and take photos. There's too much frenzied screaming again. (Muted it again for about 5 minutes.)

He then appears at another press conference in a red coat with white arm band, posing with a man who sings his praises. MJ stands, quiet and dignified, hands crossed in front of him.

Cut to MJ sitting at a laptop, answering fans' questions online. He speaks the questions aloud, and mentions his wife during one response. It's unclear if he's referring to LMP or Debbie Rowe. He says, ""I'm a visionary"" at one point during a thoughtful response about media attention, balancing his priorities and coping with rumors.

Next, circa 2000 at a Heal the Kids benefit. MJ is standing at a podium, apparently speaking to an audience. He mentions, 'Let's not even talk about finding a date!"" Later, ""Rabbi Shmuley keeps telling me he will find me the perfect woman."" Cuts to fan and then Johnnie Cochrane is on camera, commenting about MJ's innocence and putting the troubling allegations behind him.

The next segment is MJ's Christmas message to children, possibly while in Germany. It lasts about 1 minute.

The video ends with MJ's statement on CNN about the first allegations of sexual misconduct made against him. It is subtitled in German. I am not sure that it's his full statement; may be only a part of it.",1295049600,4,4483,4.629722921914357
8372685,5,B002LFJXLY,MJ was really himself at the event.  He was a great person with sincerely love to people he knew or don't knew.,1282867200,,111,4.045454545454546
8372686,5,B002LFJXLY,"It was nice to see Michael Jackson interact with his fans. He truly was loved. I didn't go to New York when he was at Virgin Records. I understand many fans from around the world were there. One of his so call girlfriends, Joanna Thomae was there. That was funny to watch. The little girl dressed like him was so cute. Michael was really down to earth. I wished I had met him.  REST IN PEACE! You are and always will be in my heart forever.

8372687,3,B002LFJXLY,"I kinda liked this DVD as it shows Michael on a one-on-one basis with his fans. answering questions, giving hugs, touching hands, I found it to be very personal the way he treated his fans. It was interesting to watch him interact with the public. If you personally asked him for something, like a hug, or shaking his hand or asking a question, he was eager to respond to everyboyd's request.",1267056000,11,392,4.535211267605634
8372688,4,B002LFJXLY,"I'm really glad I bought this DVD. I've already seen most of the Press Conferences and Store Signings on YouTube, but it is so nice to have them on one DVD to watch and not have to search. I am planning to pass down to my children all these things regarding Michael Jackson. One hundred plus years from now the public around the world will still be talking about the great Michael Jackson, his music and his career, and I want my grandchildren to know all about him. He was the Greatest Entertainer of All Time.",1264809600,2,511,4.333333333333333
