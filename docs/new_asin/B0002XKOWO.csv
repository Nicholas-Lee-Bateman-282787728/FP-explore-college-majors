2136553,5,B0002XKOWO,"I keep checking to see if they have put this movie on DVD yet...what's the holdup?  This is my favorite Christmas movie!  It reminds us that we all need to slow down and watch the snow!  The way Georgetown was decorated reminds me of how my old hometown used to be decorated.  It's wonderful to see all of their lives in Georgetown intermingled...they cared about each other and about their town!  Of course, Johnny Denver is one of my favorite singers and his acting in this movie is outstanding.  The other actors and actresses were perfect for this move as well!  My VHS is wearing out...please put on DVD!",1177286400,27,609,4.532110091743119
2136554,5,B0002XKOWO,"I am a Christmas movie addict, but if forced to choose only one Christmas movie, this would be my pick!  I love everything about this movie from the stars (John Denver, Jane Kacmarek, Gennie James) to the setting (Georgetown, Colorado) to the story (big-city father and daughter help save small, folksy town and learn the real meaning of Christmas).  This is a classic that I have enjoyed for years.  I wish it would come out on DVD -- my VHS is wearing out and I dread the day that it wears out.  I will be devastated.  At any rate, I highly recommend this movie.  It is a beautiful Christmas classic.  I feel like I am stepping back in time and into a better place every time I watch it.",1165881600,65,689,4.294573643410852
2136555,5,B0002XKOWO,"Love, love, love this movie!!! This is one of my VERY favorite Christmas movies...I look forward to watching it every Christmas. It has such a warm, hometown feel about it, where neighbors care about each other, and the true spirit of Christmas is shared amongst each other. I cannot recommend this movie highly enough...it is definitely a keeper!!!",1164672000,50,349,5.0344827586206895
2136556,4,B0002XKOWO,"This movie has been a holiday favorite of mine since I first saw it. I've always been a huge fan of John Denver, his music, and have loved him as an actor as well. I think he really shines in this movie. It's warm, meaningful, and fun as well. It always brings a smile to my face and tears to my eyes, especially as the main character John Denver plays, George Billings, sings a song to his movie daughter about finding love again.

Here is a man not looking forward to the Chrismas holiday season, as he lost his wife a year before at Christmas. He wants to throw himself into his work, get away from his New York apartment and everything that reminds him of his wife and his loss.

He takes his daughter to Georgetown, Colorado(oh how I would love and give just about anything to live in a town like this!) on a ""supposed"" vacation, which is actually a mission from his slave-driver, money-grubbing boss to search out the ""pickings""...i.e., find out if this quaint, beautiful town can be turned into a money-making resort.

What George doesn't expect is to fall in love with this town and it's wonderful residents who all amazingly, from child to oldest adult, have a deep belief in Santa Claus.

I love all the quirky fun characters in this movie. I love seeing the antagonist, George Billing's boss, Mr. Renfield, get taken down a peg or two by the town standing together to keep him from buying out their town. I love Aunt Hennie, her jolly brother Bud Sawyer of Busy Bee cab company, Susan, George's new surprising(to him) love interest, Jake Richards, Scruff, and the wonderful Alex, George's daughter, excellently played by Gennie James. (I wonder what happened to her?).

This movie will always be a favorite of mine, moreso now since I have experienced the same thing as George Billings. 5 years ago, at Christmas time, I lost my husband. Christmas had always been a favorite holiday of ours, along with our son, and losing him at that time was so hard. I lost interest in the holiday for a long time.

Happily now, I have a wonderful new husband of one year and am ecstatically looking forward to the holidays. Yes you can find love again! I am proof of that! And he is awesome! Now if I can just find us a place to live in the beautiful tress with seasons and snow at Christmas, I will truly be in heaven. (big smile)

I encourage everyone to buy this movie and make it a family holiday tradition as I have. It will warm your hearts. Oh yes, I absolutely believe in Santa Claus! =D

Now if only I could find a copy of this move on DVD....",1164585600,123,2550,4.422174840085288

2136683,5,B0002XKOWO,"As far as movies about Santa representing the spirit of goodwill in our hearts, this is one of the most thoughtful and meaningful out there.  And what a treat to see John Denver act, a skill in which he's just as good as he is at singing.  He has a natural authenticity in his acting and reminds me a little of Henry Fonda's acting style.  The story was obviously very personal to him and seems to have been written specifically for him, as his character in this TV special is an architect, which John Denver studied in college in Texas, and intentionally chooses a closer connection with nature, abandoning the city, and one of John Denver's biggest values was connecting with nature.  There are some really interesting and memorable characters in the quirky town, the real Georgetown, Colorado, which to this day is still a small town (because it didn't get taken over by the greedy real estate developer of this story).  There are also a few opportunities for him to sing, and a genuine rapport between him and the woman whom he falls in love with in Georgetown, and his relationship with his daughter (he is a widower) is very genuine.  John Denver's character in this reminds me of the predicaments Dean Jones would get in on Disney movies, where he is trying to do his job for his employer by taking a short trip to Georgetown to investigate the potential of making it a ski resort town, but by the time he has decided to resist his employer, everyone else feels betrayed, and he feels powerless to win back their trust.

I like how the plot developments and enjoyable relationships are balanced really evenly, and it is also really nice that it balances the faith element with the action element--believing that goodness/God/love can win but also doing your part to make that happen.  It also seems likely to be just as genuine an experience to people of the future because everything was done with such authenticity in it.  I doubt this will feel dated any more than It's a Wonderful Life--you know it was made in the past, but it still feels personally relevant to you in the present.  There's a line about whether Georgetown will exist in 100 years if it doesn't modernize to be a big ski attraction, and I think it'd be funny if people familiar with Georgetown saw it in the year 2086 and it still is a small town.  I'm really happy with the experience of watching it, and having seen it twice, I think each time I'd return to it, it would still retain freshness and interest to me, because it's just that good of a TV special, and now is available as a professionally released DVD.",1451347200,5,2593,4.554838709677419

2136687,4,B0002XKOWO,"I've so many dang Christmas movies I watch each year like clockwork, it's a wonder I've time for an off-the-couch life during the holidays. The Christmas Gift is one such movie I have on annual rotation, a 1986 made-for-TV joint redolent of unabashed sentiment and that old chestnut about the tiny town fending off the evil big-city corporation. It stars John Denver, a professional singer who occasionally moonlighted as an actor.

Denver plays George Billings, a widower and architect from New York City who the week before Christmas is dispatched to survey, on the sly, the remote town of Georgetown, tucked away up in the Rocky Mountains, Colorado. See, Georgetown rests on unspoiled landscape that seems like ripe pickings for a resort development. As cover, George brings along his little girl, Alex (Gennie James), the both of them still mourning her mom, his wife, what passed away a year ago during Christmastime. It's as good a time as any to get away for a while.

Still a Nebraskan boy at heart, George is moved by what he glimpses in Georgetown. See, it's one of those places where neighbors still looked out for each other, where the legend of Santa Claus is alive and well, where there's a day reserved for Letter Day. On Letter Day, the postmaster takes in nothing but letters writ to Santa. This rubs George the wrong way as he aims to mail a progress report to his boss. Except the postmistress, Susan McMillan (Jane Kaczmarek), is adamant about honoring the spirit of Letter Day. So, there's George and Susan starting off on the wrong foot. In Christmas movies, you know what that means.

Where was I? Oh, yes. Still a Nebraskan boy at heart, George is moved by what he glimpses in Georgetown. George takes in the affable community, sees his daughter happily settling in. Shouldn't startle you then that George ends up siding with the townsfolk against his predatory and unctuous land developer boss (Edward Winter). Man, it doesn't even bug me that our guy comes across a bit too worked up in his boss-bashing in front of the townsfolk. Never mind, it's a minor botheration.

I did very much like George's impassioned speech in the townhall meeting near the end. And I love his very moving impromptu bedtime serenading of his daughter. I don't know the name of the song he sings (""Love Again""?), but John Denver sings it so beautifully, so honestly. Denver and Gennie James, the young actress who plays his daughter, have incredible chemistry. And, really, it's their relationship that drives the narrative. And I love it that Kurtwood Smith is here in a non-menacing role. To me, the real Christmas miracle is that Kurtwood Smith didn't end up being the heel. Merry Christmas, Kurtwood Smith.",1448841600,,2713,4.827956989247312

2136718,5,B0002XKOWO,A classic made for TV movie from the mid 1980's. John Denver stars as a single dad and a widowed architect sent to scout a small Colorado town for future development. What he finds instead is the opportunity to start life anew and find a little of the Christmas magic he has long lost. The setting and colorful cast of characters allows this movie to step up above many average holiday films of it's type. John Denver also lends his musical talents for a couple of tunes in the film without being to hokey for the moment.,1447113600,3,521,4.381443298969073

My Producer was sitting at his desk when the guy walked in and asked if he would listen to his music~songs. The Major asked his name and he said it was, John Deutschendorf. His Dad was stationed at Carswell Air Force Base,in Ft. Worth,Tx. Can you believe it, my Producer,Major Bill Smith, turned John Denver down !!!  What was he thinking!!! The Major lost out big on that boy.
John, you are sorely missed.
Love You,

2137012,4,B0002XKOWO,"This movie is now running in rotatation on Hallmark, Hallmark Movie Channel, and even UP I think.  It's so good to see it out on TV.  Maybe it will kindle enough interest to put it out in DVD.  We have the VHS version but are careful in how much we play it.  It's a sweet story about a man finding love again and the spirit of Christmas after his wife died the previous Christmas.

John Denver was never much of an actor, but his blankness serves him well here.  After he switched to contacts, he had the peering expression of someone who still couldn't see very well.  In Jane Kazmareck (""Mom"" in ""Malcolm in the Middle""), who played the girl he met and fell in love with, he was in with the champ as she always looks slightly cross-eyed.  For the heavier acting, Kazmareck and Gennie James, as Denver's daughter Alex (she was THE child actress of the '80's and then dropped out in 1988; I understnd she is happily living in Texas - good for her), pretty much carry the movie.  The setting is a character in and of itself.  The great thing about this movie is the stellar cast of supporting actors.  Mary Wickes is Aunt Hennie, the hotel owner; Pat Crowley (""Murphy Brown"") is her brother Bud who owns the Busy Bee Cab Company, an old late-30's car that is itself a character. Everywhere there are character actors of the ""I remember him on any number of shows from the '60's through the '80's"" variety.  Kurtwood Smith, who played the father in ""That '70's Show,"" is the rancher whose ranch is the object of Denver's character's money-grubbing boss' (Ed Flanagan who excelled at such parts) desire.

A good movie that deserves a DVD release maybe with cast interviews (would be nice to see how James has grown up) or something.",1416960000,9,1729,4.485623003194888

I wish now John had sung a few more songs in the movie, but the movie is worth watching and is worth being a Christmas Classic because there is nothing wrong with believing in Santa Claus!",1416787200,4,368,4.027397260273973

It never made it big and has remained somewhat obscure, but I loved it and its message.  I hope to find one of better quality one of these days. My vhs tape is very, very  old and will probably give out one of these days, but it is still better quality than the dvd I received from your source.

2137061,5,B0002XKOWO,This is a sheer enjoyable film starring the late great John Denver.  But the true warmth of the film is that it is a holiday gem that you can watch with the whole family.  Filmed in a small town in Colorado it represents what the Christmas spirit is all about.  I have this on VHS and now on DVD and plan on watching it every year from now on!,1387238400,2,343,3.9420289855072466

It is just a heartwarming movie about a time gone by in this age of ""me, me, me"" and Ipads and Ipods. I'm so glad to finally have it on DVD!!! John Denver is fabulous, as are all the cast of characters, and I do mean ""Characters"". Georgetown CO is a place I would love to live...where family matters, friends matter, and neighbors look out for and care for each other.

I love the relationship between George and his daughter as well as the budding romance between George and Susan.  The story is very touching and the town and it's people are just charming.

2137079,5,B0002XKOWO,"This movie shows what can happen when greed and money mean absolutely nothing andthe lives of peoples beliefs are thrown away.  Stand up for what you believe in and special things CAN happen as long as ""one"" stands up. GREAT family movie",1357171200,2,237,4.642857142857143

2137081,1,B0002XKOWO,Originally recorded this movie on a VHS when it aired over 20 years ago. Family watched it every year and loved it. Was excited to find that it was available on disc. I was NOT EXCITED to find out that whoever sold it I'm sure recorded a tape to disc. The sound was scratchy and the picture quality was grainy.............neither problem would you expect to find on an original DVD.,1356652800,,382,4.4714285714285715

After research, this movie is not, nor never has been, available on DVD.  If you can catch it it the Hallmark Channel during the holidays, record it on your DVR, quality will be better than this junk copy...  Very disappointed.  I actually had a friend make me a copy from my VHS original copy, and it is better quality than this.  Very misleading....  But,  that being said, a GREAT HOLIDAY MOVIE!!  God Bless John Denver.  God forgive these junk sheisters bootlegging his work.  5 stars for the movie.  0 stars for the dirtbags selling copies on Amazon.",1356393600,4,665,4.533898305084746

2137098,1,B0002XKOWO,"Really? This was listed as NEW- but it's just a very poor quality copy, probably made from a VHS tape. We already had one of those that we made years ago and copied to DVD. I don't know how anyone can list this as NEW, which led us to believe this great little John Denver movie had been released on DVD. This might be worth a few dollars as is, but it's way overpriced. ""Brand new, still in plastic"" is very misleading and we got suckered in. Wish I'd read the reviews, but fell for the ""new"" bit.
I would not have a problem with any of this if they had just told the truth, that it's a low quality overpriced copy of a good movie. Maybe it's better than not having a copy at all, but not by much!  I think the people that gave 4 or 5 stars were rating the movie/story itself, not the product. Tell up front that it is a knock off copy and price it accordingly.",1356134400,,862,4.011627906976744

2137106,5,B0002XKOWO,"I first saw this film years ago, but remembered it!  John Denver plays George, a New York city architect.  His wife died a year ago, and he is alone with his seven year old daughter.  Throwing himself into work, he sometimes has to let his daughter down.

His boss sends him to Colorado to a small town, to do a secret survey, with the objective of buying land for a real estate development.  George does his job well, informing his boss that this would be a great place to re-develop.

As George gets to know the townspeople, he realises that absolutely everyone believes in Santa Claus, and that 'miracles' happen each Christmas.

His boss makes a move on the town - George has a change of heart and ends up losing his job in the process - and maybe, just maybe Santa Claus can make miracles happen again.",1326240000,3,807,4.412162162162162

2137111,5,B0002XKOWO,DVD arrived fast and in great packaging.  I don't know why so many DVD sellers ship in those flimsy paper envelopes.  Are bubble mailers that expensive?  This is a great film and truly captures what Christmas is all about.  No John Denver fan should be without this family holiday classic.  I am looking forward to watching it again with my 4 year old on Christmas morning!,1323820800,3,373,4.590909090909091

2137113,5,B0002XKOWO,"I watched this film on TV for the first time in the 80s and it is mandatory holiday viewing so I was excited to finally find a version of it on DVD (my old VHS had tracking lines all over the picture from years of wear & tear).  It has some nice menus as well and some John Denver trivia lol. Quality was good, much better than my wrecked VHS tape.  Living in the small market town in Colorado, picturesque and with its own traditions,of reenactments,and traditions we are also a cozy tight community. We are now also faced with large housing developments which threaten to destroy the Community and you can see why I love this film First of all-and most important, there are LASHINGS of snow!!!! Then there is the lovely legend of the Christmas Tree and also the Christian denouement as all the community cough up the money to help the destitute farmer save his farm and stay in the community. The evil developers-only after the money are sent packing as the whole town pledge their money to help protect what they have , which is very special. I love the way the whole community send their message to Santa via the post office which is misunderstood by the hero . He and his daughter have a long journey to make after the death of the wife and mother of the family. (There is a likely candidate for this)-even a sleigh ride and most heartwarming of all is that the taxi driver, whose engine is broken is mysteriously given a new one on Christmas morning and no-one had engineered it! There is a lovely moment where Denver sings a lullaby and an exciting search. Great gentle film for everything Christmas is really about, highly recommend!

2137119,5,B0002XKOWO,"I absolutely love this movie!  I first watched it on the Disney Channel before they started using commercials (back in early 90's) and taped it at the time.  I would watch my tape numerous times every year at Christmas.  The setting in Colorado reminds me so much of my beloved Snow Village collection of lighted houses which added even more to my enjoyment.  Several years later, my movie was taped over in error by my daughter, and I spent several years trying to find it with no success.  I tried taping it again, but by then it had so many commercial interruptions that it just wasn't the same.  I finally found it on ebay about 4 years ago and even purchased 2 copies should anything happen to one. It is such a sweet loving story and makes you appreciate the simpler things in life.  I think it is a wonderful Christmas classic and would so love for it to become available on DVD.",1290124800,11,886,4.398773006134969

2137122,5,B0002XKOWO,"This movie owes a lot to the Jimmy Stewart classic, ""It's A Wonderful Life."" George Billings is really a George Bailey sort of character, even the initials are the same. George Bailey had dreams of being an engineer. George Billings is an architect. Both are likeable guys trying to deal with life's heartaches. Yet, this movie works for many of the same reasons IAWL worked: likeable leading men we can identify with, a decent romance, a reaffirmation of life and the goodness of people, and Christmas. Certainly John Denver is no Jimmy Stewart when it comes to acting, but both can deliver an honest decency to their character. I just wish this were on DVD.",1257379200,18,659,4.739130434782608
