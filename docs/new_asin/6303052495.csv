550819,5,6303052495,"After seeing excerpts on Youtube, I was intrigued. The video is worth every penny. What an amazing story of a lion cub raised by two men, who then introduce the young adult to the wild. I loved everything about this story!",1244160000,,222,4.439024390243903
550820,5,6303052495,Christian the Lion is a wonderful story.  I watched the movie after reading the book and really enjoyed it. I recommend this video to all people who love animals.,1241740800,2,162,4.586206896551724
550821,5,6303052495,"After seeing the YouTube sensation, I just had to get this video, which shows the whole documentary about Christian.  Would have liked to have the DVD, but too expensive.  The VHS will do for now.  I think the Adamson's work in Africa was amazing, so impressed!!",1241222400,,262,4.6521739130434785
550822,5,6303052495,"This is an utterly heart-warming story that has a strong nostalgic feel to it, since it just couldn't happen in this world today.

Alternative: buy the dvd from the Bornfree website and help with the on-going conservation efforts.",1240185600,,230,5.052631578947368
550823,5,6303052495,"Finally finding an audience on You-tube, there is a reason this is a number one bestseller. There are DVD versions out there, just google search and you can find one. Great heartfelt story.",1217376000,7,189,4.757575757575758
550824,5,6303052495,"I have only just ordered this tape for my own, but I have watched the whole thing on you-tube. It's a beautiful story. Touching and heartfelt. I highly recommend seeing this.",1217030400,11,174,4.645161290322581
550825,5,6303052495,"In the same mold as 'Born Free', this documentary style film, to me, is much better. It's about a 3rd generation London Zoo lion named 'Christian', that acts like a human...and his eventual introduction into a life with wild lions in Africa. Much of the film centers around George Adamson, and how he forms a pride of lions out of rehabilitated, orphan cubs. Which is just amazing.

 Never have i seen such love displayed by ""ferocious beasts"". 'Christian' is a cat like no other. He will surely touch your heart.

 We found it on a $1 DVD, at Family Dollar. It's a double feature disc with another family film ('Lil'Scratch'), on the opposite side, about an orphaned bear cub. The transfer quality isn't that good, but the story makes up for it.

 It has some sad scenes and shows carcasses of large mammals, so viewer discretion is advised.

A very powerful and moving experience.

***** 5 Stars. Highly recommended!",1138924800,63,918,4.729559748427673
550826,3,6303052495,"I am reviewing the DVD by HSV (Hollywood Select Video). It is a decent enough attempt to put out a public domain copy of a 16mm film, but therein lies the problem. The PD version of this film is missing a few minutes. (The&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/official-DVD-titled-Christian-The-Lion-at-World-s-End/dp/B001EBI3GW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">official DVD titled Christian: The Lion at World's End</a>&nbsp;is complete.) Even the credits are not all there on the HSV DVD.

Because of its source, the picture is a bit soft compared to the official DVD, as well.

Heck, even the picture on the cover is just a generic lion picture; it's not Christian.

Good enough to get by, but I don't really know why this DVD is around when the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/official-DVD/dp/B001EBI3GW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">official DVD</a>&nbsp;is available.",1067472000,4,944,6.721311475409836
550975,5,6303052495,"The first time I saw the you tube clip about this lion being reconnected to the two guys who raised him and let him go to live as a free animal in the wild, I knew I would want to learn more about his life.  It was amazing how he was nurtured and cared for until he got too big to live in an enclosed area.  Ace and John did the right thing by letting Christian live in the wild, but the wonderful, touching and awesome part of their lives was when Christian remembered them a year after being set free.  Great book. True story.",1388534400,,528,4.0095238095238095
550976,1,6303052495,The story was great.  This VHS tape was a cheap made at home copy.  Very poor quality. Tape rattles and skips.,1386374400,,110,4.190476190476191
550977,5,6303052495,"This is the story of Christian the Lion, so as the song tells us (!), from a London zoo, and furniture store, and finally to the African wild, and to an encounter with a wonderful elderly man named George Adamson.  There are a number of different cuts and encasements of this story: but this is the original right footage right here.  It does not, contain, evidently, *all* the old footage, but it does contain the essential footage - that is, at least from what I know, and I have seen three versions...  Additionally, this DVD is the 'vintage presentation', which I rather enjoy, with the 'song of Christian' running merrily through it.  Yes, this film does tend to be somewhat grainer; but it is not a nuisance, and is still wonderfully enchanting.  But really all versions of this remarkable story must prove a gripping experience!  Most recommended.",1337817600,,854,4.775510204081633
550978,2,6303052495,"I saw the Christian the Lion trailer.
It had tragedy and if you are an animal
lover, don't burn this into your heart and brain.
If you don't mind crying your eyes out then
watxch it.  Would NOT recommend to have children see
it or they'll cry, too.  You get very attached to
some of the other lions and there's alot of tragedy.",1305590400,2,327,4.174603174603175
550979,5,6303052495,"I agree wholeheartedly that this is a great DVD.  The entire thing, particularly of course ""the Reunion,"" is very moving.  What makes it so moving is the love, not only the love from the men toward Christian, but especially that of the much deeper, much more intense love that Christian felt for them.  We humans have always considered ourselves as having a monopoly on pretty much everything, including emotions, in relation to the rest of the planet's inhabitants, but if you've ever had a relationship with an animal involving complete trust and communication (yes, communication, one that can be much better than even with fellow human beings), and you were willing to be open-minded and honest with yourself, you would have to conclude, I feel, that we don't begin to understand the almost infinite depth of love that animals are capable of feeling.  This recognition would be especially acute if you've at some point lost the relationship, the animal.

In any event, as rewarding as Christian's story is, it is but one small aspect in the overall treasure of the lives, both human and animal, as covered by Joy Adamson and George Adamson, in their respective books.  Years before I saw this movie, I had read all of their books, beginning with Joy's Born Free, and subsequently through Elsa's ""children,"" then about Pippa and Penny, followed by George's books and his almost selfless dedication to his lions.  Both Joy and George are exceptional writers, although the style of each is rather quite unique from that of the other.  Both are as well exceptional in their understanding of animals, in their observations and interpretations of those observations, in their intuition, in their empathy for fellow creatures without crossing the thin line into anthropomorphism.  While their work has received criticism through the years as lacking scientific empiricism and detachment (which they have never claimed to possess), if ""legitimate scientists"" had a tenth of the insight of the Adamsons, I daresay that we, well, the entire planet really, would be considerably better off than where we are now, on the precipice of the wholesale extinction of vast numbers of species, including our own.",1300752000,,2197,5.080555555555556
550980,5,6303052495,"I wanted to to see ""Christian the Lion,"" having read the book by John Rendall and Ace Bourke years ago. Christian was purchased in Harrods Department Store in London in 1969 by Rendall and Bourke, who raised him in a boutique in the city until he became too big to keep in captivity any longer. Not wishing to put him in a zoo, they made contact with noted lion expert George Adamson of ""Born Free"" fame through actors Bill Travers and Virginia McKenna. Ultimately Christian was flown to Africa where he was acclimated to the wild for the first time in his life (his parents were in a zoo) by Adamson.

The film documents Christian's life up through Rendall and Bourke's now-famous reunion with a very grown up Christian, film footage of which is ubiquitous on the Internet. The film is genuinely touching and speaks to the power of the human-animal bond, even in animals like giant predatory cats. I have always loved big cats, and greatly admire the work Adamson did until he was murdered by Somali bandits on August 20, 1989 at the age of 83. He was trying to help a tourist. Adamson was buried on his preserve in Kenya next to his beloved lion ""Boy,"" who is heavily featured in this film and became Christian's mentor and friend as much as was Adamson himself.

I think the world owes a debt of gratitude to Rendell and Bourke for trying to do the right thing for Christian, even though they knew it would mean a shorter and more strife-filled life than if he lived his days out in a zoo. They understood that lions need to be free, and although I cannot imagine letting an animal I loved as much as they loved Christian move halfway across the world and enter such a savage life, they understood the importance of big cats in their natural habitat and I salute them. I couldn't stop thinking about the selflessness of their decision and the lifetime devotion of Adamson to the lions when I watched this film, and while the movie is sometimes painful, it is a wonderful tribute to these men and all the others who helped Christian realize his full potential.",1282694400,2,2062,4.525469168900805

550983,5,6303052495,"When I saw this dvd on Amazon.com I was very exited because I was having a hard time finding it.  I knew it would be a great video, it really does show you the bond that can exist between animals and people.  I would recommend this for anyone.

7836401,5,6303052495,"Received DVD. It played fine, as advertised.

This is the fascinating and bittersweet story of Christian, the internet's most famous lion, who was a lion cub kept as a pet in London, from the time he leaves England for Africa at one year old, through his ""apprenticeship"" under George Adamson and Boy, the lion, until, at age three, he strikes out on his own, never to be heard from by his human friends again, to live free, as a wild lion in Kenya.

A wonderful true-life story. Anyone who loves animals will enjoy this. This is the film from which a short clip (when his London owners go back to Africa to visit their lion after a year) that went viral a few years ago with over 100,000,000 hits.",1461369600,,698,4.403100775193798

This is lovely and teaches us that they need to remain there and not be subject to fairs, parades, commercial ventures, exploitations, entertainment attractions and mascots at sporting events.  We are free and we should allow them to be free in the habitat that they were born.  But we must intervene to help them if needed.  I'm not for these people who say don't interfere to save an animals life.  That is not love or conviction in life.
