If you are a fan of SFW already and have listened to their music, you will most likely recognize some of the songs as the DVD is an compilation of their other albumsif you are new to SFW, I can honestlytell you they are the BEST kids music around because it teaches word for word scripture without the annoying ""kids"" music feel. My husband and I both actually enjoy listening to them. No annoying kids choirs or super high pitched singing- songs that you can sing WITH your kids to memorize Bible verses. It is cool having the instrumental versions so kids can sing these in their own- I have been wanting seeds tracks for a while, so that's mostly why I bought the DVD. The only downside is that the menus are not very clear and difficult to navigate to find the instrumental version of the songs.",1466726400,,815,4.403973509933775
