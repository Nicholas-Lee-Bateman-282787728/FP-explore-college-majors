8279347,5,B001AS5XOO,"Very interesting discussion of current paleontology and evo-devo science. Unlike most Discovery shows, this one does not create false controversies or investigate pseudo-science, but actually presents some very real and ongoing research. Jack Horner and other researchers discuss their attempts to reverse-engineer a dinosaur through genetically manipulating a bird, such as an emu.

This show goes really well with Horner's new book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-to-Build-a-Dinosaur-Extinction-Doesn-t-Have-to-Be-Forever/dp/0525951040/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How to Build a Dinosaur: Extinction Doesn't Have to Be Forever</a>. This show covers some of the same research, including interviews wit the scientists featured in the book. The book goes into the science in more detail, but the show helps give it (and the scientists) more life.",1241568000,2,891,6.955357142857143
8279348,4,B001AS5XOO,"This was a good stand alone documentary with several interesting points and a lot of great information on evolution and the relationship between dinosaurs and birds. The program itself is not bad at all, and is highly enjoyable but it has been put together in such a way that it seems a little ""over hyped"".",1233619200,,307,4.6
