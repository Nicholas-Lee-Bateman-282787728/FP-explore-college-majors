2682443,5,B000K2V7F0,"It's sad Fabin Bielinsky died (young) after making this film because El Aura demonstrates clearly that its director has mastered his domain. There are a few puzzling moments in the script and its characters, but this isn't one of those ""Don't go in that room!"" thrillers, it's old-school/neo-noir; quietly intense and full of suspense.

Ricardo Darn's peculiarly charactered performance is executed with such subtlety and nuance that it's hard to believe he's acting. The sound design and original score are beautiful, and so perfect for the film, they seem to be growing out of it rather than being imposed upon it. There are times when the lack of any soundtrack is deafening. The droning tensions and lilting piano ennui disappear, punctuating the moments of action with a moribund silence.

Sometimes I complain when a film ends with such ambiguity it appears to be a cop-out. But not here. The ending will make you rethink the journey you were just on but it won't devalue its magnificence. This is one of those rare films where the ride is so engaging that its hard to imagine anything but disappointment merely because it does end.

""Aura"" is what doctors use to describe the moment before falling into epileptic seizure. Ricardo Darn's character describes it as a moment of pure freedom. The inevitable is so clear that decisions are impossible, hence ... Freedom. Clarity.",1215820800,3,1381,4.995652173913044
2682444,5,B000K2V7F0,"I wish we could have had a dozen films or more from director Fabian Bielinsky, but because he died of a heart attack in 2006 at only 46, we have only Nine Queens and The Aura.  Ricardo Darin, a veteran Argentine actor, worked in both (so did several others in the cast, I think) and he is superb here as Espinosa, a reclusive, fairly unlikeable taxidermist who has long plotted in his mind the perfect heist.  Circumstances give him the chance to make his plots real in the forests and open spaces of Patagonia.  He is both drawn to and repelled by the opportunity.  He also finds himself less perfect in the execution than in the fantasy.  What results is a character study -- as my wife commented, you don't ever really like Espinosa, but you always want him to succeed -- and intricately paced and plotted heist movie.  The sometimes beautiful and sometimes desolate setting, the camera work, the acting -- almost every character is trapped in some desperate personal situation -- and Bielinsky's command come together for a unnerving and riveting movie that feels much shorter than its running time of over two hours.  Don't miss it.",1211328000,7,1137,4.683417085427136
2682445,2,B000K2V7F0,"After Nine Queens, a good but perhaps somewhat overrated thriller involving con games related to some rare stamps, director Fabian Bielinski followed up with The Aura. The film involves an epileptic taxidermist (?), played by Ricardo Darin (a famous Argentine actor, who also starred in Nine Queens) who, by some improbable chances and coincidences, gets involved with a gang in a casino heist in the picturesque Patagonian Andes of Southern Argentina. The plot is not very believable: Bielinski's sources for his films are not real life, but genre films filtered through some heavy and dubious philosophizing. This is not bad in itself; directors like Fuller, Melville and John Woo made some fine films out of pulp material, but Bielinski, who died of a heart attack soon after Aura was released in Argentina, was unfortunately not on their league. His two films show him as a competent genre filmmaker, but neither of those rise up to what can be considered a great film, in my opinion.",1201046400,3,988,4.993939393939394
2682446,5,B000K2V7F0,"This is just flat out one of the smartest contemporary heist films I've seen -- Darin is completely believable and the editing is sublime. Really, how many times do you hear someone talk about a film's skillful editing? Don't get me wrong, it's subtle and takes meticiulous care in building, so don't expect anything like The French Connection, but if you're patient enough to watch the fuse burn then the fireworks will ignite in your head.

2682447,1,B000K2V7F0,"I won't repeat what others have written about the movie or what you can read on imdb. I just wanted to warn people that the US dvd of this is terible. The movie is a widescreen movie presented in full frame format such that more than half your tv screen will be taken up by windowboxing. The image is so small that you can't read the credits & if you're hard of seeing you might want binoculars to read the subtitles, half of which cover the image and half in the windowboxing (with so much windowboxing, the least they could have done was to put all the subtitles in the black border.) This is inexcusable for a 2007 release & a good reason why you should own a multi-region player...to buy an import version that is anamorphic.",1189296000,15,729,4.328467153284672
2682448,4,B000K2V7F0,"For an epileptic, robbing banks, casinos, and armored cars poses some unique challenges.
Esteban is a mild mannered taxidermist, prone to grand mal seizures. Right before a seizure he experiences auras, which he eloquently describes as a moment in time when he knows something [a seizure] is going to happen, and has absolutely no control over it.

Esteban spends his days fantasizing about committing the perfect heist, while quietly selecting glass eyes for his customer's recent trophy kills. He has the perfect job for daydreaming about an elegant crime where everything goes as planned, and no one gets hurt. Clearly it's been a while since Esteban rented `Reservoir Dogs'.

Set in the woods outside Buenos Aires, `The Aura' is a well-timed, crime thriller. It has all the elements of an urban genre: a down-on-his-luck protagonist, a mysterious woman, and some really, really, bad guys.

Although he is not a hunter, Esteban begrudgingly agrees to take a hunting trip with his buddy. An overbooked hotel manager recommends a nearby rustic hunting lodge run by a husband and wife. Deep in the woods, and angered by his friend's chiding, he decides to shoot a deer. This single action brings reality to Esteban's dream, as he fits himself into the planning and execution of an armored car robbery.

Much like a seizure, once his plan is set in motion, it roars out of control, with violent and unique consequences. Starring Ricardo Darin as Esteban. Darin also played the arrogant con man in  `Nine Queens', which was later remade in the US as `The Criminal' starring John C. Riley.
 `The Aura' is in Spanish with English subtitles.",1189209600,4,1636,4.9743589743589745
2682449,5,B000K2V7F0,"Don't be put off by the violence of the image on the DVD cover for this film by Argentine director Fabi&aacute;n Bielinsky. It represents one brief moment in an off-beat heist movie that is full of twists and turns that defy expectations. Focused as it is on the mental and emotional state of the lead character, played by Ricardo Dar&iacute;n, it takes a while to even come together around a heist. Withdrawn and hyper vigilant, he's a detail obsessed taxidermist who goes hunting with an acquaintance in the woods and while in pursuit of a deer shoots a man instead. And thus begins an escapade full of deceit, danger, and increasingly high stakes, all complicated by the main character's epileptic condition that produces seizures at inopportune moments.

Dar&iacute;n is just fine as the taxidermist hero, rarely giving us more than a single intense expression registering puzzlement, concentration, confusion, fear, or fascination with whatever he is observing. A robbery, which he watches from across the street, has the creepy verisimilitude of amateur news media footage, random gunshots fired by unseen shooters and figures running for cover. Meanwhile, scenes set in deep woods alternate with barren and desolate expanses crossed by hard-top roads leading to distant towns. As with Bielinsky's previous feature ""Nine Queens,"" this film mixes genres that lead to interesting ambiguities and unexpected results. Recommended for fans of crime films with some psychological depth.",1188172800,58,1486,5.35042735042735
2682450,4,B000K2V7F0,"""El aura"" is an excellent albeit extremely unusual thriller directed by Fabin Bielinsky. Bielinsky is a recently deceased Argentinian director who was also responsible for other great movies, for example the critically acclaimed ""Nueve reinas"" (""Nine queens""). ""El aura"" is very different from ""Nueve reinas"", but both movies share some common traits, like their originality and the ability to easily enthrall the spectator.

The main character of ""El aura"" is Esteban Espinosa (Ricardo Darn), an epileptict taxidermist whose favorite pastime is to plan crimes he never carries out. The title of this film makes reference to the specific moments when Esteban knows he is going to suffer an epileptic seizure, something that in his case is triggered by stressful situations. However, and due to the fact that Esteban leads a rather boring life, that doesn't happen a lot.

One day, though, something changes. Esteban's wife leaves him, and, without knowing what to do or what to think, he decides to go hunting to the Patagonian forest.with an acquaintance. That is a strange decision, but things get even weirder when he ends up killing an unlikely prey. The result is a very strange situation that presents him with the unique opportunity of making use of his ability to plan, if he is daring enough to seize the chance.

On the whole, I think that ""El aura"" is the kind of movie you are likely to enjoy, specially if you are fond of thrillers that don't lack originality. Highly recommended!

2682486,4,B000K2V7F0,"The Aura is a flawless modern-day crime thriller brought out in 2005. It's an Argentine psychological thriller, neo-noir film directed and written by Fabin Bielinsky. And boy does he do a wonderful job creating a thick story and filming a beautiful and haunting suspense crime story.

This is how you create a thriller. This is how you create a crime, this is what psychological filmmaking is all about. This brings out the emotions and most of all it grabs a hold of the tension inside the viewer and brings them full force into the story.

Pure thick suspense, truly an awesome tale. I love a good thriller and specifically when it contains shadowy moments of mystery to unravel.

Brilliantly, brilliantly acted by some fantastic amazing one-of-a-kind, award worthy actors.

I really loved this film. Truly a remarkable movie that mixes drama with suspense and mystery and gives it a whodunit feel.

The viewer is left wondering what happened with the money, the girl, and the dog. Were those bags he is seen carrying in the end full of money?  The last scene makes the viewer think for a moment that the dog was sacrificed to become a stuffed animal but killing an animal would have been unlike him.

The plot was interesting and the acting and dialogue believable.  It was a pleasure to watch Ricardo Darin's character develop as the plot unfolded.  Some other reviewers complained the movie's pace was slow.  I thought the pace was just right - pensive, suspenseful.  And the wilderness in which most of the movie was shot was fitting for the protagonist's lonely situation.  I really enjoyed this movie, it was very well done.",1362873600,3,562,4.673469387755102

2682531,4,B000K2V7F0,This film is unique in its approach.  Who would ever expect an epileptic introverted taxidermist of participating in a huge heist?  The acting is solid and the film draws you in wondering what possesses the protagonist to get in way over his head criminally.  It also shows how southern Argentina has forests much like North America and Europe; not something you often see in films.  Good solid film.,1357689600,,400,4.838235294117647

2682533,4,B000K2V7F0,"This long slow movie managed to keep my interest altho at times it was almost against my will. The lead actor did a great job portraying a difficult character.  Yes the character is intelligent and possesses a photographic memory.  At times however he is timid and naive and stupid (when you are pointing a loaded gun at an armed man who has tried to kill you you don't need an NRA class to tell you it's a good idea to pull the trigger promptly. And when you've accidentally killed a man in a hunting accident, and you don't plan on telling anyone about it, then it's not wise to leave your fingerprints all around the area etc.)  So while the plot, main character and direction are all above average there were times when I wanted to shout, ""Don't just stand there!  Do something!""",1356739200,,783,4.454545454545454
2682534,4,B000K2V7F0,"I love foreign films.  When you come right down to it, the vast majority of American movies are pretty formulaic.  There are not too many surprises and the endings are hardly difficult to figure out.  This is a fine example of a movie that doesn't follow ""the formula"", yet it isn't different just to be different.  I've watched three movies starring the lead actor of ""The Aura"", and they all were phenomenal.  Don't delay; watch it today!",1346889600,,440,4.662337662337662
2682535,5,B000K2V7F0,"It's a true disgrace for the Latin American cinema that Fabian Bielinsky (47) has departed. His unlimited talent as filmmaker was a trademark into the filmic universe.

A taxidermist (Ricardo Darin) accepts an invitation of a friend, and as product of a fatal hunting accident, he will find in the middle of a crucial intersection ; but even so his phographic memory and his untamed passion for danger will impulse him to say yes for this risky move.

Superb photography, febrile tension and unbearable suspense will capture your whole attention from start to finish.

2682537,5,B000K2V7F0,"I second the guidance I see expressed here in one of the spotlight reviews: don't be put off by the cover image, which represents a very quick passage in the film.  Though the fear in 'The Aura' is palpable and threat of death becomes more of a possibility as writer/director Fabin Bielinsky expertly ratchets up the tension, the take of this intelligent movie is for the viewer to imagine the possible consequences.

If you enjoyed Bielinsky teaming with the great Ricardo Darn (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/El-Secreto-De-Sus-Ojos-The-Secret-in-Their-Eyes/dp/B003C0VFZ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">El Secreto De Sus Ojos (The Secret in Their Eyes)</a>) in the spectacular&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nine-Queens/dp/B00006G8G3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nine Queens</a>&nbsp;(a movie David Mamet might wish he wrote), then you're a slam dunk lock to dig 'The Aura.'  This was Bielinksy's last film before he died suddenly of a heart attack in 2006.  For fans, he left a filmography that is all too short.  'The Aura' serves as a bittersweet reminder of what might have been.

Another reason to watch: sultry Argentinian actress Dolores Fonzi (as Diana Dietrich).  Readers of the Journal of Popular Studies (a.k.a., People magazine) will recognize the name: she's the (erstwhile?) girlfriend of Gael Garca Bernal and mother (though some are disputing that) of his son, Lzaro.",1279324800,4,1461,6.202970297029703
2682538,5,B000K2V7F0,"Esteban is a taxidermist from Argentina. He's a shy, dreamer and lonely man suffering from epilepsy  refractory to the drug he takes, so, he has sometimes,  seizures preceded by an ""aura"". He has a friend, Sontag, another taxidermist, but Sontag is a stronger man less cerebral than Esteban. Both men dreams with planning a perfect robbery mostly as a distraction of his lonely lives.
  So, they decide as a defy to go to hunting deer to a far forest near Patagonia, as they are familiar with the shape of wild animals owing his work.  In the village near the forest, there's a casino next to close, and the normal hotels are plenty, so, they are counseled to go to a modest cabin  without comfort in the deep of the wood. That's the property of a man named Dietrich, who seems to rule his cabin with hand of iron and has a servant, a mysterious young girl for the service, meals and rooms, treated as a slave. But when Esteban and Sontag arrive, Dietrich is out.
At morning, the hunting party begins, but  Esteban proves to be unable to shoot and kill to the deer, scaring them with noise, so, Sontag, angry with Esteban, gets out of the hunting.
Once alone, Esteban attempts to prove himself to be capable to shoot the rifle, and he hits a shadow between the trees, but then he has an aura and an epileptic attack. When the attack passes, he discovers he has killed a man by error. The victim is Dietrich.  Esteban is totally alone with the corpse in the forest. A black, wild dog, property of Dietrich, follows from that accident to Esteban strange and ominously obedient as if he was his master from ever.
Terrorized, Esteban takes the documentation of Dietrich and returns to the cabin. There, the girl doesn't make any question, as Dietrich was a hard man and a true criminal. Effectively, Esteban goes to the casino to get some order in his mind, but there, an employee suspects of Esteban as he drives the small truck of Dietrich, and says to him Dietrich owes him 67000 dollars from betting in the roulette. To close this debt, Dietrich, the employee and two another criminals are planning a violent robbery to the armored car that transports the money of the casino.
The two another criminals appear. They are hard gangsters and killers. Esteban has to simulate he doesn't know where is Dietrich. He says he's also in the plot, introduced by Dietrich, but the two gangsters are experienced and they soon are aware that Esteban isn't by far a professional thief. The confrontations  begins and the mature employee of the casino is killed by the gangsters. Esteban, with the black dog, has to follow the facts.
The attack to the armoured car is done, but there are not two guards, but three, owing the next closing of the casino, a fact the gangsters didn't  knew. This is a bad surprise and the first two guards are shot and killed in a terrible  bloody confrontation, but the third refuges in the steel compartment of the security case with the money. At last he's killed also, but he wounds the chief of the gangsters. The three men gets away, but the chief dies from his wounds and Esteban, a wise man, finally kills the other. Then he suffers another aura and another attack.
For me, the intention of the director is to do a comparison with the real, quiet quotidian life and the hallucinating facts dreamed by Esteban, so, the robbery is a specie of aura or a nightmare compared with daily, ordinary life.
Or you can think, as at the end we see Esteban seated in his routine work room of taxidermy, all these adventures have been only an ""aura"". For me this is unbelievable, but the director has an indubitable talent for the mystery surrounding the magic.",1264377600,,3670,4.579268292682927

I think this is a highly underrated film.  Yes it may not be a very fast paced film, but the subtleties found and achieved by Ricardo Darin's performance are magnificent.  To me, he's the Al Pacino of Latin America when Pacino was PACINO, if you catch my drift.

A man realizing this fantasy, one that I could relate to because on more than one occasion I have thought the same thoughts, was just outstanding to watch.  How different real life is from fantasy, how easily things can go differently than planned... all shown in this wonderful film.

If you liked 9 Queens, Fabin Bielinsky's previous film, and like Darin's performances, then I can almost guarantee you'll like this film.",1234396800,,799,4.795620437956204

At 2 hours its long  but the slow build up pays dividends in a way it is extremely unusual to see from movies made in the USA . From the Director who made his reputation with NIne Queens, a Movie about a  confidence trick . (That movie was an International hit and highly recommendedit .) ""Aura"" has all the polish and surprises you would like to see in a crime thriller.
