1366338,5,B00004WLTP,I really enjoyed this movie. I wasn't expecting much because I  knew of no one who had seen the movie prior to myself. Now though I recommend this movie to any one who enjoy's intellectual black humor. I really appreciate Jamie Fox taking comedy to another level. For those who enjoy more than your modern day black exploitation films you'll be pleasantly surprised.,1090886400,7,366,4.809523809523809
1366339,4,B00004WLTP,"To tell the truth, I enjoyed ""Breakin' All the Rules."" It is one of those romantic comedy where nobody knows who anybody else is, and you know that everything is going to be alright at the end. But sometimes that could be alright in the plot is good. That is exactly why this is a good movie. It has a good story, and it has alot of witty dialouge. It isn't a masterpiece, and it's not going to be on my Top 25 of 2004 list at the end of the year, but it is pretty good. Jamie Foxx is the star of the movie, and I never really saw him act before. I never saw his television show, or any of the movies that he made. He was good in this, and that could be a good sign for his next movie ""Collateral"" starring Tom Cruise.
Jamie Foxx plays Quincy Watson. He works with his cousin Evan at spoil magazine. Quincy gets a new job from his boss Philip, where he has to fire people. He gets dumped by his girlfriend on that night that he was going to propose to her, and that causes him to quit his job, because he realizes that getting dumped and firing people are one of the same. He insteads writes a book. A break-up handbook on how to do it, when to do it, where to do it, why to do it, etc. It is a bestseller, number one of the list, and soon he is being asked by Philip on how to break up with his girlfriend Rita, who married people for their money. Even then gets the idea that his girlfriend Nicky is about to break up with him, so he decides to have Quincy go to a specific place, and talk to her about him. He has never met her, and she got a haircut from the last time Even saw her, making her look like Halle Berry. Quincy talks to her, thinking she's somebody else, and the two start a relationship of some sort. Rita then finds out that Quincy is helping Philip break up with her, and she goes to his house, but finds Even there. She sleeps with Even thinking he's Quincy, in order to have him stop helping Philip, and the case of mistaken identies grows deeper.
There are so many movies that have the case of mistaken identity, but some how ""Breakin' All the Rules"" pulls it off. In the beginning, once Quincy writes his book, you get to hear lines from it, and advice from him. It is interesting to hear things like this, and the movie is filled with witty dialouge like this from start to end. ""Breakin' All the Rules"" was not a big hit at the box office, and it is just about out of theatres, but it is a sure fire hit on DVD. It was better seeing it in a movie theatre in front of an audience, but I wish  that more formula comedies that come out are half as good as this was. This is the perfect kick off to the summer comedies after the terrible ""New York Minute"" and it is a remedy for those who aren't fans of action movies like ""Van Helsing"" ""Troy"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow.""
ENJOY!
Rated PG-13 for sexual material/humor and language.",1088035200,3,2854,4.07829181494662
1366340,4,B00004WLTP,"This was a cute romantic flick with some laughs here and there. Overall I'd recommend it to those who are not ultra critical of their movie choices... just go, relax, and enjoy the light-heartedness of the movie.",1084752000,6,212,4.756756756756757
1366341,2,B00004WLTP,I was greatly disappointed by this movie. It waste the talent of it's brightest stars such as Gabrielle Union and Morris Chestnut. The plot of this movie started great when the character Quincy played by Jamie Foxx is dumped by his girlfriend on the night he plans to announce their engagement. But from there The plot turns into a convulted mess. Gabrielle Union was the save of this movie. Which is sad really! She is such a amazing actress but Hollywood has yet to utilized her potential. Morris Chestnut plays Quincy cousin a player Who uses women for own selfish reasons. But here again an actor who was funny and wonderful in such movies as the Brothers and Two Can Play at This Game. Just was hanging by a slender thread. Jamie Foxx was very funny and clever but not enough to save this movie.,1084579200,3,800,4.524137931034483

And the pug did a great job also!! It's always great to see a good love story - especially one involving African American main characters.

I'll give it an ""A"" for effort. Though not flawless, this movie is not disappointing and should be given a try.",1193443200,,418,4.546666666666667
1366402,3,B00004WLTP,"Well, first ya gotta look at what type of movie it is. By no means was it planned out to be an Oscar Winner, or a Blockbusting Special Effects Movie...It's just plain Funny. You have about 3 or 4 misdirections in the fact that Quincy (Foxx)is sent his friend Evan(Chestnut) To break-up with E.'s Girl Niki. Who has a feeling that is what is happeneing so she lies and says her name is Mary. So all Chaos insues. But in the end everyone gets the girl; it's a Funny comedy of Errors. As usual Jamie Foxx is funny as ever, and aside from the main plot there are little side things that make you laugh.

  I only gave this movie a 3 because I'm comparing it to ALL the other movies...but as far as a comedy Date movies this bad boy is a 4.5+. So I Hope you find this review useful. And Yes the tips in the movie actually are useful. I only gave them a ""Field Test"" Once...but they worked like a charm. This isn't the same type of movie as Brown Sugar, or any of the other movies that are billing like this one. It is truely in a class of its own. Got a lil' something for the guys to laugh at, and the girls to get a little something out of too.

  One thing is for sure...she'll definately understand after watching the movie why the words ""Baby we need to Talk"" Scare a dude to death. Enjoy Guys!",1149552000,,1294,4.094861660079052

1366404,3,B00004WLTP,"this film in some ways was a Pre-cursor to Will Smith's ""Hitch"".Jamie Foxx is a writer who gives out advice. Morris Chestnut always got a role in the Soul Buppie flicks. Gabrelle Union is cool as always. this film works because it doesn't get to predictable though it does lose some points because not enough laughs or predictable runs in spots.still worth given a looking at.",1109462400,,376,4.712121212121212
1366405,4,B00004WLTP,"Jamie Foxx & Gabrielle Union are magnetic.

Breaking up with someone is always a difficult thing; especially when the person being dumped isn't ready for the relationship to be over.

But this film gives some great tips on how to do it and get out of the person's house in one piece. I just hope my woman doesn't use them on me! I would be seriously hurt! LOL!

Fun film! One tip though, park your ride in your garage at all times!",1108944000,3,431,4.2317073170731705
1366406,4,B00004WLTP,"Breakin' All The Rules is a mediocre-to-fun movie made more than serviceable by its awesome cast, which include Jamie Foxx, Gabrielle Union, and the gorgeous Morris Chestnut.  Jamie Foxx stars as Quincy, who has been unceremoniously dumped by his girlfriend at their engagement party.  When layoffs loom at his job, his boss asks him to research the science of firing employees--and Quincy discovers that the manner in which he was ""fired"" by his girlfriend was all wrong.  Research leads to Quincy penning a runaway bestseller on how to break-up with your lover--chock full of theories tested out by cousin and best friend, Evan (Morris Chestnut).  When Evan suspects that his current girlfriend Nicky (Gabrielle Union)is about to break up with him, he sends his cousin Quincy to plead his case.  Mistaken identity ensues.....and the two become romantically involved.  What follows is a hilarious tale of romance gone awry.....great fun!!

1366407,4,B00004WLTP,"I love this movie because one I like chick flicks and two it is a smart and sassy flick.  Jamie Fox is great and so is Gabrielle Union.

The movie is about a man (Jamie) who is dumped by his girlfriend and writes her a letter which in turn becomes a novel.  Everyone loves his book and wants his advise even his cousin and boss.  When trying to help his boss his cousin gets in on the plan yet Quincy (Foxx) doesn't know that his cousin is pretending to be him and that everyone is getting further into the game.  Quincy is falling in love with his cousin's girlfriend which also adds to the mix of things.  This movie is a good comedy and is all about breaking the rules of romance.

1366408,4,B00004WLTP,"With this movie along with Ray in the same year, Jamie Foxx is proving himself to be an actor with a solid degree of range and has proven he can handle comedy, romantic comedy, action and drama.  He's really come a long way since the days of ""In Living Color"".

When he is dumped by his girlfriend, Helen (Bianca Lawson), magazine editor Quincy Watson (Jamie Foxx) becomes a down and out depressed shell of a man.  He works for a magazine and soon Quincy comes up with a self-help book for men detailing easy steps to take when breaking up with women. The book becomes a best-seller, but trouble soon finds its way to Quincy's door when a case of mistaken identity leads his best friend's girlfriend Nicky(Gabrielle Union, `Bad Boys 2`) into his arms.

The movie is not without some flaws...there are many of the usual sterotypical angles about blacks that we see so often and a lot of the humor is forced.  But the cast does a pretty solid job throughout and Foxx plays his role very intelligently.  Not the greatest movie but good for a few laughs.",1107216000,2,1050,4.5

This light bit of fluff is easily ignored as a movie with one great exception: here is a veritable feast of African American talent such as Foxx, the very beautiful Gabrielle Union and Bianca Lawson, Morris Chestnut whose talents are minimally utilized.  The cast is rounded out by Jennifer Esposito and Peter MacNicol (remember him as Stingo in 'Sophie's Choice'?).  The story is slight but at least it doesn't dumb down the audience.  Viewing this film makes us pleased that Jamie Foxx has left the comedy mike and is committing to films that deserve his superb talents.  Grady Harp, November 2004",1099353600,3,884,4.827814569536423
