Because there is no time or distance in the spirit, we can pick up the anointing that comes off of this dvd as if we were really there in that room experiencing the glory.  God is real! And He has been allowing me to experience the real Him as I watch dvd's like this one. He has been showing His glory and coming into my house as I soak in Him using the dvd! Praise God! I absolutely love this dvd! What an awesome tool to use to worship the Lord with! Thank You!",1231286400,,485,3.9489795918367347
