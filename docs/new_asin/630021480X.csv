To ignore this film, is to forget that this mindset continues to hold sway in the mind of many Americans of ALL racial and ethnic groups. It's not easy to watch, but that's what makes it all the more important to see.",1410566400,,454,4.82051282051282
7806543,5,630021480X,The movie is a rare insight into an American National Socialist organization in California. The producers were very objective and let the NSWPP members speak their own mind. I give this a 5 thumbs up because it isn't saddled with bias commentary in it. Judge for yourself.,1230508800,4,272,4.808510638297872
7806544,4,630021480X,"I have to take issue with L. Chalfant's review of this item, claiming the makers of this fine documentary exhibit bias - which is true to some degree, as all filmmakers do to some greater or lesser extent, whether consciously or not. However, in the case of ""The California Reich"" it's hardly necessary for the documentarians involved to do anything other than let the cameras roll and allow their subjects to condemn themselves with their rabid, loathsome racist doggerel. These pathetic goons are so lame it's often laughable - until you hear their children spouting hateful garbage (these are the ""loving"" families Chalfant refers to in his review, I guess); one little boy in particular declares his ambition to become a policeman so that he can ""kill n---ers."" One does have to wonder about the political affiliations of anyone who goes by the nickname of 'CSA fan,' as does the reviewer L. Chalfant. Yeah, hmm...",1221436800,3,918,4.929032258064516

directed by Keith Critchlow & Walter F. Parkes
approx. 55 minutes

This was one of the first documentaries to show footage of neo-nazis playing dress-up.  These aren't the tattooed skinhead thugs that we occasionally see on television these days, they're grown men with uniforms whose wives bake them swastika-shaped birthday cakes.  They have a blasphemous worship of Adolf Hitler and rework the American pledge to match hateful neo-Nazi ideals.  They play ""show and tell"" with their kids, having them say racist things for the camera.  The editing and titles are clearly supposed to make us worried that groups like this are a growing threat but the footage itself looks like what happens when racists grow up without access to ""Dungeons & Dragons"".  The interviewees don't really discuss their philosophy that much- most of them just point to a general dissatisfaction with the direction of the country and unusurprisingly place the blame on blacks and jews.

When chapter leader Allen Vincent is asked about his criminal past, he gives what would normally be considered a ""liberal"" answer: that he's a victim and that society is to blame for his loneliness.  Perhaps its telling in some way that the only people that seem to take the group seriously are the far left.  We see footage of leftists attempting to prevent the ""National Socialists"" from speaking at a local college, which may be useful for starting discussions about ""freedom of speech"" (a similar controversy happened in late October 2006 at Columbia University).

This film was nominated for the Best Documentary Oscar in 1975 and one of the directors (Parkes) went on to produce huge Hollywood hits such as Twister, Men in Black and Minority Report.",1174867200,6,1742,5.080701754385965
7806546,1,630021480X,"This film starts out by saying that it presents its subjects ""in their own words"", then goes out of its way to show these patriots- National Socialists in 1979 California- as oddballs, betraying an obvious prejudice at every step. But the filmmaker fails at several junctures: the families portrayed are obviously very loving and close; at the protests shown, the anti-National Socialists are screaming savage animals; and despite the efforts of the filmmaker, the organizational skills and leadership abilities of Allen Vincent shine through. All in all, though, a very one-sided waste of time.",1106956800,11,595,5.340425531914893
