8546890,4,B00A6F1Q8Y,"The designation ""Romance"" on a film collection generally ensures that I'll skip right over it, but the films included here are such an eclectic assortment of interesting vintage titles, that I'm glad I added it to our library.

You get ""The Astonished Heart"", Noel Coward's drama of stiff-upper-lip infidelity. Not as highly regarded as his work with director David Lean, but still containing Coward's polished dialogue and it's co-directed by Terence Fisher, who would soon bring his touch of class to the earliest and best Hammer horrors.

Then there's ""Always a Bride"", a charming comedy of fraud on the Riviera, with likable young leads Peggy Cummins and Terence Morgan, directed and co-written by Ralph Smart, who would go on to TV's excellent Danger Man.

""The Young Lovers"", which won a BAFTA for its screenplay, is an effective, well-filmed drama that shows a specific human cost to the paranoia of the Cold War. The often stylish direction by Anthony Asquith made me mourn the loss of an era when sexual intercourse could still be depicted by cutting to ocean waves crashing.

Oddly, the title that I was most anticipating, ""Quest For Love"", proved the least satisfying. Adapted from a story by John Wyndham, creator of Village of the Damned and Day of the Triffids, it has an intriguing ""alternate reality"" premise but what's done with it seems a bit half-baked. But looking online, there seem to be many fans of this film, and it is worth seeing.

I've enjoyed several of these ""Great British Movies"" boxsets from Strawberry Media. They typically package together films that I might never have purchased separately, but I've been glad to own. Unfortunately, the individual discs are never housed in slimcases, so they take up a full DVD case width per title on the shelf. Also, they never have any extra features, not even a trailer. But these are minor quibbles. I'd be happy to look for a Romance - Volume Two.",1457481600,,1923,4.886503067484663
