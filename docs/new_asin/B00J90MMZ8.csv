6339391,5,B00J90MMZ8,When Hollywood lets you down with endless sequels and remakes its great to see independent films with heart tell a great story! The Shop is definitely worthy of a view.,1434326400,,168,4.633333333333334

6339394,4,B00J90MMZ8,The program on Judge Mathis today (11/2/14) did  jthe movie justice. It is obvious that there is a market for this DVD. I would like to purchase the DVD's to give as Christmas gifts.,1417478400,,182,4.352941176470588
6339395,3,B00J90MMZ8,"Saw this item on Judge Mathis and was going to buy it for support, but it's unavailable.  Thus, I gave it a mediocre score presuming it was at least okay going by the trailer on Judge Mathis.",1417478400,4,191,4.162162162162162

6339397,4,B00J90MMZ8,"Movie was Fun yet thought provoking at times.  DVD Quality was EXCELLENT, Sound quality was EXCELLENT...
I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars because it could have been  more bloopers provided....

My favorite characters were Jae, and his crew Sharon & Mike....(I dunno why) LOL

Great movie,
Congrats to Michael Shawn Cunningham and his entire cast & crew!!
This movie is proof that you don't have to have a lot of money in order to create an independent film that has Great quality!",1399075200,5,479,4.6
6339398,5,B00J90MMZ8,Very entertaining and uplifting at the same time. This movie keeps you intrigued with its cast of diverse personalities enthralled in mischief. The humor was unexpected much like the ending.  The injection of religion through out was refreshing approach that was welcomed and appreciated.  Well done,1398729600,5,299,5.478260869565218
8648816,1,B00J90MMZ8,"According to insiders... one of the producers.. Tony.. is a lying manipulator who finances his B movies by scamming investors and then dissappears.  He pays the actors with the investors money then ditches the investors. Not a good look for a wanna be producer.... with fake credentials. The cast and crew deserve better and are potentially ruining their reputation by dealing with someone with such a lack of morals, qualifications and character. Hollywood beware... investors beware... distributors beware... actors beware.",1492992000,,525,5.5625

8648820,1,B00J90MMZ8,What a poorly written poorly directed and poorly acted film.,1439596800,,60,5.1
8648821,5,B00J90MMZ8,Great movie!  Watched it twice and gonna watch again.  My favorite funny parts are when they went in to rob the store and also at the house.  Also it's a mystery to know that the cop was in on the diamonds!,1439337600,,206,3.975609756097561
8648822,4,B00J90MMZ8,Really enjoyed the movie,1438732800,,24,5.25
8648823,3,B00J90MMZ8,"Shawn (Jonathan Andre) inherits a Mustang for his uncle. It contains stolen diamonds. He makes the mistake of allowing a mouthy homeless Blaxplotation character see them. Now everyone including the owner is after them and they all have guns.

The film starts out a bit disjointed with missing scenes and an odd religious scene that never tied back into anything. The acting and dialogue were fair, and the sound quality (especially in the echoing shop) could have been better. Good funny scene of robbers trying to escape while pulling up their trousers.

Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity.",1438560000,,588,4.989795918367347
8648824,4,B00J90MMZ8,Storyline was great and a lot of action,1436486400,,39,4.0
8648825,4,B00J90MMZ8,"Good movie. Became interested after watching the case on Judge Mathis. Having ""New York"" in it from flavor of love should not be the selling point.  I could tell that it was low budget but I still think it was well done. What took away from the movie for me was that it had too many story lines. Kudos, the director pulled them all together at the end but too many storylines distract your audience, causes confusion. Tell one story develop it well..my thoughts. P.s. Chauncey was soo handsome in that pink! Mr. Cunningham You've got talent!",1436400000,,541,4.577319587628866
