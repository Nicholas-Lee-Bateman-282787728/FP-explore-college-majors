5927150,2,B00ELE8DYG,Was not what i thought.like the new one's better. This one was hard to follow and understand at times  and silly.,1392163200,,113,4.380952380952381
5927151,5,B00ELE8DYG,"It was great to be able to finally see these episodes. I'm a big fan of Last of the Summer Wine, and really enjoyed this. It puts the well known characters into a specific time and place. Episodes are fun to watch, the acting is first rate. Has a different feel than Last of the Summer Wine -
Only once criticism: This set DOES NOT have captions. The British accents are not always easy for me to understand. With Last of the Summer Wine it took a few viewings to be able to really listen to the dialogue. The BBC releases of Last of the Summer Wine also have captions, which made it easier to follow. This is not a BBC Video release and does not have captions.",1391558400,14,661,4.171875
5927152,2,B00ELE8DYG,"My wife and I are avid fans of the British Comedy 'Last of the Summer Wine' written by Roy Clark.  We thought this prequel to the long standing comedy would be funny also.  The background of the comedy is Norman Clegg (Peter Sallis) playing the part of his father who was very dull.  Clegg,Compo, and Foggy are shown in their teen years and the comedy tries to show them being funny as teens and where their friendships came from.  I am sorry to say it is not funny but the cd is good if you want a full collection of the series.",1391040000,4,529,4.1568627450980395
5927153,5,B00ELE8DYG,the series is a big joy to me and many others.  we talk about it and realize it fits in our lives even now.,1390521600,8,107,3.4583333333333335
5927154,4,B00ELE8DYG,"Didn't love it like the original series. If more is made, maybe it will get better. I miss the simple joy of the, 'Last,' series.",1389225600,6,129,4.2
5927155,4,B00ELE8DYG,This movie gives us another direction to explore in the series.  It is good clean fun and enjoyable for the family.,1387324800,10,115,4.476190476190476
5927156,1,B00ELE8DYG,It is nothing like the first series. It is not until the 3rd  dvd does it just start to get funny(barely).,1385856000,2,106,4.0476190476190474
5927157,5,B00ELE8DYG,i love watching this series because now i can understand some of the character from Last of the Summer Wine and it is fun to see them in their younger days especially Compo,1385683200,11,172,4.242424242424242
5927158,5,B00ELE8DYG,A really well-done prequel.  We get to see our LOSW friends as they grow up.  I would have liked to see them at war . .  but maybe not.  Watch this and know how they got to be the wackos that they are.,1384732800,13,201,3.604651162790698
5927159,5,B00ELE8DYG,"This was apparently a very short lived series lasting only two seasons, which is a real pity.
The seven episodes in the first season are interesting in a variety of ways in that they are set in May of 1939 and do, I suspect, make a very good stab at capturing at least some of the essence of the period.

There isn't quite the same flavor of Last of the Summer Wine in these episodes, but they were looking at the possibility of war, after all.
And had a pretty good notion of what it would mean.

That said, the humor is certainly there. And it gets somewhat madcap at times.

A really fascinating thing about it is that most of the characters from LOSW are shown as late teens/early twenties and are every bit as engaging in this aspect.

About the only caveat I have is that in some cases it is a bit of a stretch to imagine some of the individuals developing physically into their LOSW sucessors, But that is a very minor quibble.",1384560000,34,934,4.259887005649717
5927160,3,B00ELE8DYG,Not as good as the Last of the Summer Wine.,1454976000,,43,3.4

5927162,5,B00ELE8DYG,"An an intro to the Summer Wine series it was good.  I like the rest of the series better.  They are relaxing and just fun and you get
to know the characters and enjoy the settings and the adventures.",1447027200,,199,4.076923076923077
5927163,4,B00ELE8DYG,"When it went from ""First..Wine"" to ""Last...Wine"", the writing and characters improved.  Enjoyed watching this just so I would have a better understanding of how the characters developed from those Young guys to the old codgers.",1441929600,,227,5.305555555555555
5927164,4,B00ELE8DYG,Just what I wanted!,1440028800,,19,4.0
5927165,5,B00ELE8DYG,"Ok, here goes. First of all, I love, love love Last of the Summer Wine. It is my most favorite television programs anywhere. So I had to have this one, too. It has proven to be a good program as well. It was fun and it was enjoyable. I got a few chuckles and laughs from this one, too. It is very nice to have it in my Wine collection. This is good stuff and I do recommend it for British comedy lovers. I am quite happy with First of the Summer Wine.",1439769600,5,451,3.860215053763441

5927168,5,B00ELE8DYG,Love it,1431475200,,7,3.0
5927169,3,B00ELE8DYG,"This was not exactly what we expected.  There should have been more episodes and it would have probably fleshed out the series better.
The First of the Summer Wine was not bad, just was not up to the standard of The Last of the Summer Wine.",1428796800,,240,4.217391304347826
5927170,4,B00ELE8DYG,This series explains the Last Of the Summer Wine series. This was the gang in Last of the Summer Wine when they were young. You can see the personality in each character and how it carried over to the later series. .,1421712000,4,216,4.166666666666667
5927171,4,B00ELE8DYG,"I love the characters of the Last of the Summer Wine - even though these are not them, it's still great humor.",1419638400,,110,4.045454545454546
5927172,5,B00ELE8DYG,Take of prequel of Last of the Summer wine and it does have Peter Sallis and other great British stars.,1419292800,,103,4.2
5927173,4,B00ELE8DYG,"my husband and I have been enjoying watching it. it is funny to watch the portrayal of some of the old delinquents when they were young. I especially enjoy the early Wally Batty and the Foggy character. The situations are amusing, and there is some funny character development. I did wish that they would have used Peter Sallis a little more, but it was fun to see him. While it may not be as good as The last of the summer wine, it has some humorous tie ins with the program. When the second season becomes available in America I will purchase that also.",1416355200,5,555,4.346153846153846

5927176,5,B00ELE8DYG,have seen all the Last of the Summer Wine series.  these actors have done their best to channel the original characters.,1406764800,,120,4.714285714285714

5927179,1,B00ELE8DYG,"I love LAST OF THE SUMMER WINE, and thought FIRST of the Summer Wine, which depicts the main characters of ""LAST"" in their youth, was a great idea. However, the actualization of this clever idea was tedious and dull. The youthful actors over played every scene, and the entire series was filmed predominantly on a sound stage. The plots were often over-the-top and never very funny. I can see why this program only lasted one Season. I would not recommend purchase.  Again, this was a clever idea not executed with any finesse or cleverness.",1400716800,3,541,4.75531914893617
5927180,3,B00ELE8DYG,"Not as good as the original series I love, Last of the summer wine. Don't waste your time on this one.",1400198400,,102,3.9047619047619047
5927181,3,B00ELE8DYG,"This tries to build the lives of Compo, Clegg and the crew when they were all youngsters. It is not nearly as good as the original LSW. Compo just seem to be a delinquent with very bad teeth. Clegg doesn't seem to have a plan for life to follow. Clegg's father (played be the LSW Clegg) seems to be a man lost in his own world. If season two isn't any better, it will be a waste of money.",1398988800,3,388,3.9240506329113924
5927182,5,B00ELE8DYG,Enjoyed the prequel to the last of the summer wine.  Loved the fact Peter Sallis played his dad in the prequel.  It helps one to understand the personality of Norman Clegg.,1398211200,,172,4.516129032258065
5927183,5,B00ELE8DYG,Watched as the characters could be brought forward into the Last of the Summer wine. Waiting to watch the second season.,1397952000,,120,4.761904761904762
5927184,5,B00ELE8DYG,fabulous movie. goes well with the Last of the Summer Wine series to provide background to how this group of retirees originally pal'd up,1397260800,,137,4.75
5927185,1,B00ELE8DYG,it stunk not seller's fault. mine for choosing this slap stick yach yach yach yach yach yach yach yach yach/ this is the last review that I will waste my time on.,1395532800,2,162,4.09375
5927186,5,B00ELE8DYG,"I have long been a fan of the Last of the Summer Wine. I found this 'First of the Summer Wine' to be of high quality visually. My only wish is that there would have been some introductory pictures with character names so it would be easier to follow the antics of the individual characters; e.g., Nora Batty appears in this series but I find it difficult to identify her. All-in-all I'm pleased with the purchase.",1395446400,,413,4.447368421052632
5927187,5,B00ELE8DYG,"I ordered this because Last of the Summer Wine is one of my favorite all-time shows. At first it was difficult to visualize some of the characters as the characters on LOTSW, but after getting used to it, I have developed an appreciation for this series even outside of the context of LOTSW. I liked it so much that I ordered Season 2 and an external DVD drive so I can watch it on my computer. (Season 1 is available in region 1 format but season 2 is only available in region 2 format at the time of this review). I love what they did with the sets. It is fun to see the newer favorites, likes Sid's cafe, before it was Sid's Cafe, as Hygienic Fisheries and so much of the decor is in a style more like art deco. Also, Maggie Ollerenshaw who played Ethel in the LOTSW episode with the love mobile  (one of my favorite LOTSW characters) plays Mrs. Clegg, Norman's mother and she is absolutely delightful!",1394496000,,905,4.292397660818714
5927188,5,B00ELE8DYG,The only thing I would wish for would be more episodes and/or more season.  A fun set of shows that give a little background to the other series.,1393977600,,145,4.178571428571429
5927189,4,B00ELE8DYG,the only problem was the quality of the recording. It would have been great had it been remastered if possible. Being a great fan of the show this series really set the basis for what came later so it is easy to over look the quality.,1392854400,,234,4.108695652173913

8606643,5,B00ELE8DYG,The crusty characters so loved in BBC's Last of the Summer Wine are shown here in the bloom of youth.  A fine addition to the collection.,1469145600,,137,4.269230769230769
