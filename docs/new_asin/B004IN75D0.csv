4387087,4,B004IN75D0,this was actually a pretty good movie. it was inspiring and down to earth. Bjron Lomborg. Knew what he was talking about. It's true people just don't care. well we ought to start. this was a good movie. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do,1309305600,,258,4.18
4387088,4,B004IN75D0,"Global warming is a controversy in which tempers flare as much as the temperatures.  ""Cool It!"" brings a calmer, better reasoned assessment of the situation, and offers a number of more effective, and less wasteful means to make the world a better place - certainly among the worthiest of goals.

Perhaps the most significant assertions made in this movie are:
1.) Global warming is real, and human activity contributes to the problem
2.) The alarmist claims of an imminent global melt down are not supported by the real science of the climate.
3.) The proposed system of carbon trading (cap and trade) of the Kyoto Protocols and similar agreements, is essentially a money laundering boondoggle which will cost hundreds of billions of dollars, and provide minuscule benefits in return.

It is this last item which is the crux of the movie.  The star of the movie, Bjrn Lomborg, is author of the book ""The Skeptical Environmentalist"", and was persecuted for his work to take a more objective look at the issue of global warming.  The heat on Lomborg came from political pressure, which has a tendency to come from corporations and people with fat wallets, who stand to lose a great deal of money (potential profits) if their agenda is thwarted.  By disclosing the profit motive behind Cap and Trade, Lomborg incurred the wrath of these powerful interests, and has been demonized by much of the environmentalist community.

This is not to say that Lomborg is entirely right, and that all of his proposed actions are worthwhile.  But it does mean that concerned citizens should undertake a more objective evaluation of all the evidence, all of the proposals, all of the projected outcomes, and all of the motives behind them, before rushing into foolish, costly, and ineffective solutions in this matter.

So why only four stars?  Because I believe we need a huge change of lifestyle across the world.  With America burning as much fossil fuel as quickly as possible, we are unnecessarily shortening the lifetime of our oil-dependent civilization.  And since much of the fuel is wasted in transportation, we should greatly reduce our travel, and instead work, shop, school and play much closer to home.  Lomborg calls for some very desirable actions, such as health care, education and sanitation in Africa.  But without curbing the wasteful use of petroleum in the U.S. and developing countries (China and India) we only exacerbate the main problems, while putting band-aids on the minor.",1309132800,3,2486,5.002427184466019
4387089,5,B004IN75D0,"This is one of the most important documentaries about Global Warming (or as it is more politically correct known as ""Climate Change"") since the topic surfaced a couple of decades ago. Instead of a polemic about catastrophes and devastation, this is a commonsense view of the issue and some potential remedies. How reassuring to see how many intelligent people are addressing the issue with ingenious ideas that avoid overwhelming social costs. Get the DVD from Amazon because you may be sure your local multiplex won't feature it!",1303516800,4,530,5.103448275862069
4387090,2,B004IN75D0,"I will preface my review with some background. When I watched Al Gore's film An Inconvenient Truth, and being an Environmental Studies student, I believed every bit of it at the time. At least until some questions started coming up a few years later. For one thing, I wondered, why were politicians and the media now asking the everyday ""Joe"" to cut down on his or her ""carbon footprint"" instead of actually addressing the root of the problem, such as, getting us onto cleaner and more efficient sources of energy such as solar or wind instead of oil? Upon further research it became apparent (and an obvious ""duh!"" moment) that plants need CO2 to breath so why is CO2 now considered such a deadly toxin? And how did the issue change from CFC's destroying the ozone layer as being the primary reason for global warming to the current emphasis on CO2 emission causing a greenhouse effect that leads to global warming? There were just too many questions, not enough answers, and that, along with the media blitz that includes ridiculous scare tactics and name calling caused me to second guess the Gore film (for examples on this see the commercial with the classroom children who were not conforming to current global warming belief norms so they got blown up with blood spattered everywhere, also if you don't follow the new norm of global warming belief you are now considered a ""global warming denier"" - a obviously insulting and very inappropriate holocaust reference).

Fast forward to this film Cool It. My initial impression is that for the most part I liked the film. It seemed to be a good counter balance to Gore's film, with some insight into the questions I've been pondering. It reaffirmed some of the doubts I was already having and provide some possibly more legitimate solutions to the problem. So far so good. Why 2 stars then? Because there is a big problem with the fact that this film heavy promotes geo-engineering as a likely solution. Right now we are having enough problems with geo-engineering as it is with low altitude spraying that is coming under huge opposition by the general public (the LBAM - Light Brown Apple Moth spraying in California and possibly elsewhere) as well as the higher altitude spraying known as persistent contrails or ""Chemtrails"". If you are not familiar with Chemtrails let me assure you this is not a conspiracy theory - just watch the films Don't Talk About The Weather or What In The World Are They Spraying? that you can watch for free on Google Video or YouTube and you will see all you need to know about why the government should not be conducting any additional geo-engineering projects.

In sum, Cool It provided a bit more of a fair and balanced response to what has become Gore's propaganda piece An Inconvenient Truth. More level-headed coverage, insight, and possibly more realistic solutions to our energy problems are included here, but the emphasis on geo-engineering as one of these solutions was the turd in the punchbowl for this film - it ruined the message.",1303084800,12,3030,4.802681992337165
4387091,5,B004IN75D0,"Found this to be a very persuasive argument that we need to at least re-evaluate the world's ills and our actions and try to make decisions at the level of doing the most good.  Right now we do basically react to everything as if it was a single, lone issue.",1302652800,3,258,4.16
4387092,5,B004IN75D0,"Fantastic!  Lomborg believes in global warming but believes money should be spent where it does the most good.  He shows that the usual solutions proposed for global warming (like cap and trade) are extremely expensive (about $250B/yr) but produce virtually no results.  He discusses things that can be done to actually help reduce global warming which are MUCH cheaper than the usual solutions.  He also discusses many other problems (like malnutrition) that could be solved for far less than we would spend on global warming, but produce a huge result and leave the world a better place.  To me the most interesting part was the promising technologies that are in the research & development phase, like fuel from algae.  This is a reasonable approach to global warming; its fact-based, sound science.  Watch this and you'll come away with a positive outlook for the future.  Excellent DVD.",1302480000,27,891,5.054794520547945
4387093,5,B004IN75D0,"This is a fascinating documentary about Bjorn Lomborg, who wrote The Skeptical Environmentalist, and other books discussing Global Warming (or what is now often referred to as ""Climate Change""). Bjorn Lomborg has become something of a Boogyman for the environmental left, which perplexes me. Here are the broad strokes of what he believes, as outline in this documentary:

A.) Global Warming is happening

B.) It is contributed to by man's activity (he doesn't specify how much or how little he thinks man's contribution is).

C.) It is a problem that needs to be addressed.

For this he is routinely pilloried by those that...believe in global warming? Doesn't make sense, right? Well, that is because here are a couple of other things he believes:

D.) While Global Warming is a problem it is not going to lead to the end of the world.

E.) There is too much fear mongering and bad science involved in the current debate.

F.) The most commonly proposed solutions (in large part reducing carbon emissions) have enormous costs and provide almost no benefits (for example, about a 0.1 degree reduction in the projected temperature over a CENTURY, at a cost of 180+ TRILLION of today's dollars).

For this he is attacked and insulted. People try to discredit him and ruin his career.

I have watched An Inconvenient Truth, and now I have watched this. While this movie does indeed easily debunk a number of claims made by Al Gore's movie, I wouldn't consider it the Anti-Inconvenient Truth, but it certainly provides a good counterpoint to that film. I would recommend everyone watch both and decide for themselves where they come down on the issues.

I should also add that this is not completely devoted to global warming. There is an underlying theme that advances the proposition that if we want to generally benefit the planet let's be honest about what we can and cannot do, and what things can be done that have a greater impact and/or a lesser cost per ""unit"" of impact, as opposed to things which are less effective. For example, see the example of the cost and benefit of attempting to attack global warming above, versus attacking, say malaria, which would objectively save millions of lives over the course of a few short years, and it would only cost a fraction of a penny of every dollar being advocated for combating global warming (and with a return on investment of almost ZERO).

What are the most logical items that we can influence to improve the human condition planet wide? What is the biggest bang for the buck? Global warming ranks second to dead last.

You will see a lot of bad reviews from a lot of people with an axe to grind against the subject of this documentary, and most of them will not have watched the movie. I say if you believe in science and open inquiry then why would anyone object to more voices being present in a debate? Watching this film put me in mind of a few quotes by Burke:

* We must all obey the great law of change. It is the most powerful law of nature, and the means perhaps of its conservation.

* Whoever undertakes to set himself up as a judge of Truth and Knowledge is shipwrecked by the laughter of the gods.

* It is a general popular error to suppose the loudest complainers for the publick (sic) to be the most anxious for its welfare.

* The people never give up their liberties but under some delusion.

This is a well made and informative film, and the intellectually honest reviewer should credit that, even if s/he disagrees with the subject of this film. See it and decide for yourself.",1299715200,88,3555,4.644338118022328

4387118,5,B004IN75D0,"Science is shown to be closer to religion than is usually believed. Lomborg was attacked in the media as 'heretic', not a scientific term. Gore's movie is 'propaganda' a term started by the Catholic Church in the Middle Ages. This movie shows school children drawing the future death of the planet, like the mideveal obsession with hellfire.

The teaching that unless the new priesthood of environmental science is believed and obeyed, the earth will end in a fiery destruction, seems a secular version of the teaching of mideveal hellfire for those rejecting the priesthood of that time. Another reminder of religious belief is the idea that God will burn up the earth to punish sinners.

Julian Simon is credited with the ideas that challenged Lomborg's beliefs. He attempted to disprove Simon and failed. Interesting that the only idea of Simon's covered was that economic life is improving. This one thought was enough to start Lomborg in a new direction. Simon's picture is shown with devil's horns added.

Fear is shown to be the goal of the environmental community, not truth, and is needed due to the danger to the human race. Remember the inquisition justified suffering with the idea that the more suffering here and now on earth would remove or prevent suffering in fire in the future next world.

4387121,3,B004IN75D0,"I show my students the last 45 minutes of this movie.  It is an excellent contrast to other films that only paint a dismal, negative picture with only one climate change solution: stop burning fossil fuels.  I can't give a movie I can only use partially 5 stars.  In fact, if I based my star giving on the movie as a whole, I'd take one more away.  There is a full 45 minutes of Mr. Lomborg working hard to convince us that he's not the monster other scientists accuse him of being.  It goes so far as to include a touching visit with his mother that has no connection to climate change whatsoever.  It's never appropriate to pimp mom out.  If I were teaching a unit on self-promotion and propaganda, I'd use the first half to show my students bad examples.

The last 45 minutes show innovative ideas to possibly mitigate our carbon problem.  Mr. Lomborg did an excellent job of seeking out these inventors and engineers and showcasing their solutions.  Ideas that were in the early stages were properly presented as only possibilities- but they are exciting.  I do have to admit that I end my climate change unit with this film because it is my goal to incite innovation.  And I must also admit that I agree with Mr. Lomborg:  we won't get enough nations on-board the climate change train until we can figure out how to make changes that are less costly, more efficient, and consumer friendly.  We need to spend what little money congress allows on research and innovation.

This could be a 5 star movie if it were re-edited.  No one remembers his fall from grace.  In the film he says he was exonerated (and it sounds like that word was patched in) but that's not really true.  A panel of Danish scientist found that he was not guilty of malice when he used improper research data in his book, but that he was too inexperienced in interpreting his data.  He was young and foolishly bragged that he knew better than every other established climate-change scientist and it came back to bite him.  I'm glad it didn't stop him from making this movie, but it does seem clear that the purpose of this movie is to promote himself as still relevant.  That purpose backfires because I feel compelled to explain his fall from grace to new students every year.  No one cares about that now.

Not an unreasonable position - nominally - and one widely and rigorously pursued through the climate policy community.  It's not the call for reasonable analysis by Lomborg that attracts criticism, but rather that his own analysis is so trivial and superficial, structured in a way that can only lead to the sophomoric conclusion that policy is better directed at the false choice of curing malaria rather than reducing climate change.

It's the thin disingenuous patina of ""reasonableness"" that makes this the darling of the zealous climate deniers and the scorn of serious students of climate change - whether in the scientific or policy domains.",1419638400,8,961,5.180645161290323

I suggest that people stop trying to play God and wake up to the fact that the more they try to solve big problems like this through science and money and technology the more problems they create then they solve. science has just scratched the surface to how this planet works how climate works and how it's systems work,  they cannot predict the weather very accurately past a few days how can they really say with certainty that in 50 years climate will be 3 degrees warmer? okay lets say they cool the planet by a degree or two, how will that benefit us the planet the animals and plant life? what is exactly so bad about the earth being warmer? longer growing seasons? warmer more comfortable winters? higher plant growth? more animal/plant diversity? (notice the warmer the zone the more animals and plants the colder the zone the less diversity in animals and plants.) when the earth was cooler as they say winters lasted longer storms were severe too and hurricanes were very bad, starvation was rampant, and animal species died off.  droughts were bad too. What evidence do they really have that the planet is experiencing a severe warm up? temperature gages in airports? gages next to pavement and apartment buildings? temperature gages in space? what? I read their evidence and I find it unconvincing. I am more worried about all this scaremongering and forced acceptance of this ""theory"" if you have the truth there is no need for force through brow beating, increased taxes and constant push on the media newspapers and commiting fraud as well? Man will not solve these big problems, whether global warming is true or not, only devine intervention will do so, after all the creator knows how this universe and planet work. he knows exactly what the optimum temp is. matt 6:9-10 remember like anything science technology can be a double edged sword, used for both bad and good. people in positions of authority can either use it for selfish pursuits or for the benefit of others. corruption has shown to be a serious problem in all spheres of life.and most likely this global warming hype is just hot air.",1411257600,,2164,4.783422459893048
4387127,4,B004IN75D0,"I do like the different perspective of how to tackle global warming. The beginning begins with Bjorn being scrutinize for his book and I recall the scene when someone threw a drink at him. This reminds me of Edward O. Wilson, when he introduce social-biology idea.

I am from the South Bronx and some of the major issues are asthma (from air pollution), lack of jobs, loss of social identity, and lack of understanding of the science or seeing it as not important. I am not a person that likes to just talk, I usually want to know solutions. So, I try to look at issues from different perspectives. I have noticed in the movie that he mentions noble laureates in economics and usually brings out the $250 billion per year number. I wonder where the materials and energy come from to create this technologies. I will like to see how biophysical economics plays in understanding what those $250 billion means in the biophysical sense or thermodynamic sense. One of the concepts I am aware off is the Energy Return on Investment. Currently, most of the technologies mentioned do not come close to 30 to 1 ratio of energy that you get from oil. However, this may be do to the lack of investment on this technology to increase the Energy Return on Investment.

He made a point about population growth and how this is going to place most humans in vulnerable situations. This is true and has occurred long before Global Warming was an issue. I believe that Global Warming is Real. It is happening, but I do not like the approach people are taking to solving the problem.
Also, one nation cannot decide what happens to others. Some problems requires the collaboration of all who live in this planet. Nature does not discriminate, it does not have national boundaries.

One concern is the belief that technology can solve all the problems. Sometimes low technology can have a greater benefit. Some ideas around is to design passive houses (that uses most of the suns energy), thermally active surfaces (to stop using HVAC systems that don't conform to our body heats and cools). On my mind are the social implications of ideas. We may not be able to live in our current state because society changes, our norms, our ways of design change. We cannot plan to keep what he have now, All we can do is adapt. I once told a person that in a hundred years, there may no be such a thing as a nation. All, we can do is to find solutions that are sometimes simple and we do not that they are. I always fall in a grey area, believing somewhat in technology and not betting everything on them and being hopeful enough to stop throwing drinks at someone because they are thinking differently. I do not agree with some of the content here; but I do agree that is helps environmentalist like me to think of the problem from a different perspective.

Some people in my community do not believe in such a thing as global warming, but some do know how it feels when they cannot breathe when they are having an asthma attack. Also, with more people in cities, new philosophies of what normality will spring up and it will ask questions at what level do humans should try to control the earth. We may come close, but we cannot be naive to state that what has been in the works for billions of years, we can do better in our species lifetime.",1409529600,,3313,4.507487520798669

4387141,3,B004IN75D0,"In this documentary one is given a well-spoken and calm presentation about how societies face different national and global problems.  Similarly, in one's personal life there is frequent prioritization, so it is understandable that Lomborg can make a persuasive argument that society also needs to prioritize goals.  The question, one which has vexed philosophers and lawmakers for hundreds of years is:  how does society balance one goal against another?  What list of priorities is best, and in what order?  Lomborg argues that making CO2 reduction as the prime goal can detract from funds for vaccines or clean water.  Yet these goals are probably not incommensurable.  That's my view.  The idea that the goals are commensurable (comparable, not exclusive) and reinforcing is also the position of the Nobel Prize winning scientist Richard Smalley, as presented in his article ""The Terawatt Challenge"" and the YouTube presentation ""Our Energy Challenge.""  In those materials, Prof. Smalley has a set of goals - the ""Top Ten Challenges of the 21st Century"" - that are closely similar to Bjorn Lomborg's human development goals.",1400457600,,1128,5.327683615819209

The vital message Lomborg has, is that we seem to be unable to think critically when confronting the issue of climate change.  He  ABSOLUTELY BELIEVES humans have accelerated the climate cycle our planet goes through repeatedly. He, however presents the critical argument that we aren't doing the things that can actually achieve what we claim we want: more people on the planet living better lives, achieving a higher standard of living for 3rd world countries, and creating a cleaner planet.
He's a Macro-Economist (think ""Freakenomics""), and he's charismatic.  This combines for an enthusiastic ride of pie charts, figures, and reflective questioning about what our real goals are and how our actions, when looking at the data and results, may not be the best way to achieve the most good...that some of what we throw billions of dollars at, just makes us feel good while the actual results be damned!

4387163,3,B004IN75D0,"The key idea that Lomborg and this film raise is *cost benefit analysis*. But that unsexy angle doesn't cut much ice, and so it is largely buried in the first half by Lomborg's personal story & argument-from-conversion, and in the film's second half by a review of global geo-thermal-engineering concepts. It's frustrating to watch this with a middle school kid who is interested in the subject, but gets confused by the apparently contradictory changes-of-direction in Lomborg's case: at first he presents a very compelling argument that *the anticipated global sea level rise in the next century will be similar to that since 1870, and that centenarians would rate this rise as a very minor explanation for the problems of the 20th century*; but later he contradicts the implications of that by arguing that it is vital to slow global warming & that it is might be worth investing in scary Doomsday machines to do so.

It's a pity that the film covers the subject at such a superficial and high level. By doing this, and containing elements that implicitly contradict one another Timoner has made a film that will confuse more minds than it changes. On the other hand, there's a lot here that is interesting, and some viewers new to the subject will learn about areas to consider that they might then be interested in investigating further.

The impression one gets from the film is that it it a part of Lomborg's advocacy to move the debate beyond the binary (""AGW is it real?"" to the question of: ""AGW, what to do?""). This is another very unfortunate aspect of the way it has been put together. I would have thought that there were two good approaches to making this film:
(1) Give Lomborg direct editorial control to make his case or
(2) Give equal time to quantative arguments made by those (like Lomborg) who believe that direct carbon trading has a terrible payoff and those who think it is worthwhile
The first approach would work as a counterblast to An Inconvenient Truth, and the second approach might work as a scientific debate, but what has actually been produced is neither. The edit very obviously takes Lomborg's side, but throws in some weak and non-quantative arguments by his opponents, presumably to give the illusion of balance (or maybe to show what he's up against - but that's yet another documentary entirely).

I don't think that this film knows exactly what it wants to be or what it is trying to do. This topic arouses passions, and it's understandable that the film-makers hedge as much as possible, but that's no excuse for raising & then immediately dropping so many different points or for confusingly lurching from analysis to travalogue to biography and then petering out.",1361836800,,2708,4.831896551724138

This documentary illustrates the very real problem of global warming and discusses how best to solve this for the benefit of both present and future generations. And he relates to a cost/benefit way of thinking and takes us through the bureaucratic machine and alternative solutions.

The documentary itself is a little self promotional and the first 30 minutes especially seems like a mushy infomercial. But, as the documentary progress it all fits together and end up forcing you to think sceptically on how to solve problems, not only global warming but many other global problems as well.  So don't let the first 30 minutes discard you.

The documentary is as much about global warming and possible solutions as it is about how the bureaucracy on this level of decision making (and obviously a major critic point in this Documentary).

""We should not just solve a problem if the cost of solving that problem will be even greater than the problem itself.""

The above comes from this documentary featuring Bjorn Lomborg.  According to this film, Lomborg is the author of the best-seller ""The Skeptical Environmentalist"" (2001) and the organizer of the ""Copenhagen Consensus"" (a project that seeks to establish monetary priorities for advancing global welfare using methodologies based on the theory of welfare economics).  The problem mentioned in the above quotation is climate change or, as the media likes to call it, ""global warming.""  (Lomborg admits that global warming is real, a serious problem, and that it's caused by humans.)

Viewing this film, one might get the impression that this film is based on the best-seller mentioned above.  NO.  The DVD case also doesn't mention any actual titled book.

This documentary is actually based on Lomborg's book ""Cool it"" (2007).  I found it interesting that this book is not mentioned anywhere in this documentary.  In Amazon's ""editorial review"" for this film (shown above), it seems that Amazon's editors think it's based on Lomborg's best-seller.)

This entire film gives a one-sided presentation based on Lomborg's personal point of view.

In the first third of the film, a few of the topics discussed are:

Scenes from Lomborg's life, the Copenhagen Consensus, the Danish Committee for Scientific Dishonesty case, Lomborg and his mother, and Lomborg's travels.

For this part of the film, I found it quite interesting that we're not told who Lomborg is.  Perhaps he's an economist?  NO.  Perhaps he's a scientist?  NO.  In Amazon's ""editorial review"" for this film (shown above), Lomborg is cited as a ""Danish scientist.""  In fact, Lomborg's main credential is that he has a Ph. D. in political ""science.""  I also found it quite interesting that we're not told anything about Lomborg's lifestyle.

In the second third, some of the topics covered include:

Cap and trade invites corruption, poor people in developing countries, children in a rich country, fear, predicting the future, alarmist propaganda (especially from Al Gore and friends) regarding sea level rise, hurricanes, malaria, polar bears, and light bulbs.  Cap and trade, also called emissions trading, is a market-based approach used to control pollution by providing economic incentives for achieving reductions in the emissions of pollutants.)

I found for this part that Lomborg's explanations were either to simplified, overly optimistic, not true, not based on science, a distortion of the facts, or exaggerated.

In this part of the film Lomborg brings in what he considers to be experts on global warming.  One of these experts who he brings in several times is octogenarian Freeman Dyson.  You would think Dyson is a respected, top-rated climatologist.  NO.  Dyson is a British-born American theoretical physicist and mathematician, famous for work in quantum field theory, solid-state physics, and nuclear engineering.

Some of the topics covered in the last third of this documentary include:

Solar energy, wind power, more on the Copenhagen Consensus, energy storage, nuclear power, wind energy, adaptation, and geo-engineering (or, more accurately, climate engineering).

In my opinion, it's worth seeing this part of the documentary but you still have to be wary of what Lomborg says.

Finally, there are many claims throughout this film about costs and benefits.  Lomborg states them as if he knows for certain what the costs will be many decades in the future.  But nobody can predict these with precision.  Lomborg tries to tell the viewer that he knows the exact answers, and avoids telling us that there's a wide range of estimates.

In conclusion, this documentary presented by political scientist Bjorn Lomborg is only really interesting in its last third.

4387178,5,B004IN75D0,"In this later version of Cool It, Bjrn Lomborg has altered his stance from one skeptical of the value of attempts to fight human caused global warming at this time to one that addresses it as a more immediate concern.  This is an argument he is much more likely to win.  In the process, he has also simplified the economic arguments, which I had already found to be very simple (I have a BA in economics).  I would not have believed this was necessary.  However, an earlier reviewer of Cool It was unable to understand the difference between relative expansion of the monetary supply (inflation) and relative economic growth (increase in standard of living).  A friend of mine made this same mistake.  I had forgotten how difficult economics can be.  This film makes such mistakes much less likely.  To put a number on his growth argument (something he doesn't do because it is largely a big guess), if we had begun fighting global warming in 1900 in the way mainstream environmentalists suggest, we would now have the standard of living equal to that of the late 1950's.

Bjrn Lomborg's willingness to put a price tag on what he advocates and compare benefits is what make him unique. As always, he asks hard questions, admits they're hard questions, and presents a real answer.  The bottom line is that even if human caused global warming is a myth, following his prescriptions will not cause significant economic harm to the world.  If humans are to blame for global warming, his solutions are likely to work, something not true of his competitor's solutions.

I have serious disagreements with Bjrn Lomborg.  Still, his willingness to admit to limited resources when attempting to save the world is something so obvious and so rare that his value as a humanitarian cannot be overestimated.

The piece also contains links to a site that documents numerous factual errors and instances of plagiarism in Lomborg's film and books.",1312761600,12,431,4.837837837837838
4387181,4,B004IN75D0,"Just like An Inconvenient Truth, the personality gets in the way of an otherwise fine production. It would be nice to see the biographical and political content kept to a minimum. It is needed but not to the point where it bores not only the high schoolers I enjoy sharing this stuff with, but eventually me as well.

In regards to informing the public about global climate change, I liked, in order: 1) the scientific facts, 2) the politics that hinder addressing this topic, and 3) the feasible solutions.

Now with the feasible solutions to global climate change, I think that there were a few ideas missing. Leo Caprio's 11th Hour does a good job of pointing some out, so does Gore; and I wished to see some of their spirit incorporated into Cool It. I think that there would have been some benefit in investigating the good points of any number of documentaries on this topic (while avoiding their negative aspects) would have made for a better presentation. I guess it's up to the viewer to do so.

This is definitely my favorite documentary of global climate change to date, yet I still have hope that an even more comprehensive one will follow.",1311897600,4,1152,4.637254901960785
4387182,5,B004IN75D0,"Like arguing politics and religion, I've found it very difficult to convince others that this subject is more complicated than just ""saving the world"" by drastically reducing everyone else's lifestyle.  While deftly dodging the global warming denier = bad human label, Lomberg calls the bluff and concedes all the hot button scientific issues.  With this out of the way, it is hard for people to ignore the cost benefit analysis of the common solutions compared to remarkably cheaper and more effective options.  The example where hundreds of billions of dollars on CO2 mitigation efforts will save only one polar bear, while taking away permits to shoot hundreds of the same bears, will (you do the math...) save hundreds of them ... shows how far the priorities have gone off the rails.

Don't forget to watch the deleted scenes; these more ""inflammatory"" segments were cleverly left in the dust bin for all to find.  They highlight the prevalent silencing of opposing scientific opinion and the financial and political motivations behind some of the very expensive solutions.

If only we could get this film to be required viewing in my local schools like Al Gore's ""An Inconvenient Truth"" was.  Cool It clearly demonstrates that everyone should do their own research and be skeptical of the motives of those who say they know all the answers and use fear to force immediate action before additional time can prove them wrong.  The late Michael Crichton said it best in State of Fear, ""I am certain there is too much certainty in the world.""

Cool It provides a great source of balance that is sorely needed.  Sadly, those who need to see this film the most will avoid it like any other information that does not affirm their heartfelt beliefs.  When fear and blind faith rule, all of society suffers.",1311379200,5,1804,4.881967213114754
4387183,5,B004IN75D0,"Cool It is a documentary about Bjrn Lomborg. He founded the Copenhagen Consensus think tank which looks at the world's problems and decides where money would be best spent to tackle them.

He is most known for his views on global warming. Many people think he is a global warming skeptic, but this is not the case, rather, his argument is that the current approach to solving the problem is hugely expensive and will achieve very little. Instead he suggests spending the money on initiatives that will have a clear benefit to mankind, and on research into new, carbon neutral energy sources that appear to have great potential.

It makes a great deal of sense, and you are left wondering why politicians are not paying more attention to the Copenhagen Consensus's ideas.",1311206400,5,770,4.825757575757576

It is a great, middle of the road approach to global warming, with a wider lens on investigating the economics behind both global warming, as well as other governmental spending proposals that have been explored the past few years.
