8155597,1,B000KC8MJY,Horrible photography - says it was made in 2006 but it looked like a 1975 movie.  Just HORRIBLE could not get passed the first 5 minutes.,1448236800,,137,4.269230769230769
8155598,2,B000KC8MJY,"I liked Millennium and I wanted to know what happened to Jordan, which is why this gets two stars instead of one, but this is a pretty low quality production with a confusing storyline and bad acting. Renting it for $2 and watching it online was about as much as I was willing to spend on it.",1310342400,,292,4.140350877192983
8155599,1,B000KC8MJY,"After buying and watching Millennium: The Complete Series I was up for some more Millennium.

I stumbled across Millennium Apocalypse and ordered it up. Unfortunately, my excitement wore off after watching 20 minutes of this movie. It was at that point that my wife and I had to turn it off. The acting is very poor, and other than the character being named ""Jordan"", there is no real connection to the original series.

I did end up watching the entire movie, though at 2x speed to get through this travesty.

To quote Don Knotts in The Ghost and Mr. Chicken, ""The horribleness and the awfulness of it will never actually be forgotten.""",1238457600,,637,4.669642857142857
8155600,4,B000KC8MJY,"""Millennium; Apocalypse"" is an independent production, building off the success of Chris Carter's (creator of the X-Files) series ""Millennium"".

Frank Black's daughter, Jordan (wonderfully portrayed by Shoni Alysse Cook), is now a young woman, who gets caught up in the fervor of the surviving factions of the Millennium Group which had plagued her father's existence. Frank himself has been missing for the past 12 years, and is presumed dead.

After the death of her grandparents, by the same virus which killed her mother, Jordan is approached by a member of the Millennium Group, Christian Fields (Joe Amos), who offers her the chance to discover what truly happened to her father, as well as the imminent apocalypse, which the surviving factions of the Millennium Group are convinced is at hand. Jordan becomes swept away in a web of lies, Group propaganda, and government conspiracies (a nice, albeit loose tie to The X-Files, IMHO), to a confrontation with the man behind the power, in a supernatural setting which melds very nicely with the styles of ""Millennium"" and ""The X-Files"".

Millennium: Apocalypse was originally released in segments on the net, by Digital Shadow Films, an independent film company in California, but is now available for sale, which has me very excited! The only negative I can see is that due to copyright laws, a brief segment of ""Millennium"" footage that was used as a flashback on the internet release, probably won't be included in the story, though it really connected this production to the series. This is why I rate it at 4 stars, though if the original ""Millennium"" footage were still in there, I'd give it five.

But don't be fooled, ""Millennium: Apocalypse"" was an outstanding production, each segment leaving me hanging until the 'net release of the next, leading up to the climactic finale. It's a good movie, and I hope that you'll check it out!",1163548800,3,1895,5.006349206349206
