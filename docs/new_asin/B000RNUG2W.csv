8325682,4,B000RNUG2W,"A bit pretentious, a bit obvious, overlong, even at 74 minutes (this would have been
a brilliant 40 minute short), but still full of arresting images and surprisingly emotional moments.

Influenced heavily by Kubrick, Antonioni and most of the great 60s and 70s visualists, this
is a wordless film about two robots who want to become human.  The action is minimal.
The opening drive through the desert alone takes a good 15 minutes.

But it's wonderfully shot, and the use of eclectic source music as score (Brian Eno,
Curtis Mayfield, etc) is interesting, if sometimes a little too self-conscious or intrusive.

I doubt there are more layers to be found on repeated viewings, I think it is what
it is: an experimental film more full of image than story or ideas.  A 74 minute, interesting rock video.

But every time I'd head toward terminally bored, an image or feeling would reel me back in...",1317254400,,896,4.785714285714286
8325683,1,B000RNUG2W,"I watched this on pitchfork.tv expecting something truly awesome.  There's no Daft Punk music.  Throughout most of the movie, there's this awful ticking noise.  Yes, I get it.  Robots want to be human.

I want my 74 minutes back.",1229126400,,229,4.769230769230769
8325684,4,B000RNUG2W,"When Daft Punk first hit in the 1990's, they (re)set the standard for cool. Their music was both insanely grating and euphoric, completely mechanical but also funky. They had an amazing flair for visuals, and had the sense to mask their identities, making themselves more than just two French guys with an 808. Over time they took on their robot personalities, a move that's culminated with their current live show. See it once, and all you'll be able to think about for weeks is ""the robots"" and their magical, wonderful rave pyramid.  If that sounds goofy, you haven't seen the show. It's truly one of the more spectacular things I've seen (and heard) in my life.

A central theme of the show (and of their recent music) is the robots' desire to be human. This theme gets blown out into movie form with Electroma. Slow, silent (but for occasional non-Daft Punk music), and weird, the movie has been trashed by reviewers around the world.  Most boring movie ever, pointless and retarded, an excuse to learn how to film; etc.

But while I was prepped to hate it, I have to say the movie has stuck with me, and I find myself thinking about it all the time. I don't know if its just a holdover from my obsession with the live show, but I don't think it is. The movie is an enigma, a visually striking extended metaphor about being an outsider, filmed in a style that can only be described as ""70's."" In fact, if you had to best describe it in a sentence, Electroma is simply ""a 70's movie about two robots who want to be human.""

There are endless shots of the robots driving through the desert, walking through the desert, visiting a Stanley Kubric-inspired labratory, looking at other robots. None of it is particularly interesting in the moment (I'd recommend you read a magazine or something while the movie's on), but in retrospect, the slight plot and strong visuals of the movie somehow condense in your memory to become an intriguing, melancholy little video. In my mind, the movie is about 5 minutes long but contains an hour of sentiment and thematic possibility.

I've often said that if an artist is intentionally vague or beguiling (think ""Sound and the Fury""), people will fill up the empty space with their own ideas and call the author a genius.  I don't know that the robots were genius when they devised this movie, but I have definitely filled up the empty space they left behind with my own ideas. Somewhere between their rumbling dancefloor funk and their pulsating rave pyramid, the robots are in the desert, truly bummed about not being humans. I'm bummed for them, and wonder about them often.",1186012800,5,2615,4.647186147186147
8325685,5,B000RNUG2W,"Where to begin...  I've been a Daft Punk fan since 1997 when ""Da Funk"" and ""Around the World"" took the Earth by storm and got everybody shaking their booties.  It wasn't until I was front and center at their famous 2006 Coachella performance (their first public concert in 8 years) that I became obsessed with them.
  They've gone through many changes since they started as an indie-rave pop duo in there ""Homework"" era.  They became robots.  They made a Japanese anime film (Interstella 5555) to coincide with their bubble-gum dance album, ""Discovery"".  Then they started getting a bit macabre when ""Human After All"" came out.  It was obvious Daft Punk wanted to experiment more with video.  From the creepy robot animatronics in the ""Technologic"" video to the shocking girl that skins herself alive in the ""Prime Time of Your Life"" video...  ...we knew that the robot kings of French house music were trying to tell us something.  They want to be human.
  I do not recommend this film to anyone that doesn't appreciate arthouse or French cinema.  Of course it's a bit obscure.  It's French!  It was made for the 2006 Cannes festival.  I doubt it will ever be released in the U.S.  It's barely over an hour long.  There is no dialogue.  It is mostly silent with some sound effects and a few melancholy folk tunes to set the mood.  DISCLAMER: No Daft Punk music was used in the making of this film.  There are a lot of long takes and landscape shots.  The cinematography is incredible, though.  And it is very obvious that the production is Kubrick influenced.
  The basic premise is Daft Punk, as robots, drive through the California Desert (Death Valley?) and enter an ordinary suburban town where everyone is robots, just like them.  But they want to be human and have a procedure done to look human.  It fails.  They realize they cannot hide who they really are.  The rest of the film consists of what they decide to do with themselves while walking through the desert.  I won't ruin the ending.
  Daft Punk's Electroma is great for those who love low budget indie movies.  It's especially great for those who understand the media circus around Daft Punk and can separate this film from their musical abilities.  If all of this sounds appealing, go try to see it (if you can find it).",1183248000,6,2288,4.663316582914573
