8641336,1,B00IDRQ44I,"The ""Remastered"" discs cut parts out! Some are subtle and barely noticeable even if you know the show fairly well. But some are just obvious that something is missing. For example- in the episode Stacy Petrie part 1 on the 3rd disc, Rob goes into the office and tells Sally he has a favor to ask. She says yes without knowing what it is. He says don't you want to know? She says you want me to go out with a fella. Then she immediately says, Rob you come running up here to tell me you have a fellow that's not for me?
Now in the original episode, Rob actually does tell her he has someone that's not for her. But they skip right over his lines in this version.
I have no idea why they decided to shorten the episodes by cutting sections out but they did. I would buy an older version because those have the full episodes. I checked, after sending this one back.",1522972800,,862,4.167664670658683

8641338,1,B00IDRQ44I,"I bought this in December of 2016 for a Christmas present. It came in the usual sealed packaging that movies come in. Unfortunately we just now opened the package and disc 1 and disc 2 are missing. Disc 3 has several spots that freeze and take you back to the beginning. We have not watched disc 4 or 5 yet, but it won't change my review even if they are in perfect condition. This is a huge disappointment since it was given as a gift to my son. In the future we will be opening all movies we buy to make sure the entire set of discs are there that should be included. The Dick Van Dyke show is a great family show----even better when you get everything you paid for.",1504742400,,668,4.106870229007634

8641342,4,B00IDRQ44I,"Unnoticed by the producers of this set (both DVD and Blu-Ray versions), they have omitted the 4th season episode: ""My Two Show-Offs and Me,"" broadcast on December 16, 1964. This episode IS included if you buy the Complete Series set. Why it has been left off here is a mystery to me, but this is NOT the Complete Fourth Season, so it gets knocked down one star.

What is here, of course, is priceless comedy from a team of master actors and writers. By the fourth season, the series had found its footing and was cranking out one classic episode after another,

And these sets also include bonus features that are plentiful and well thought out.",1437696000,4,645,4.551724137931035
