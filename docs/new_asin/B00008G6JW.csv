7982716,4,B00008G6JW,"As far as I know, this is the first of only two docus on KV (the other being episode 6 of the BBC's excellent series ""Secrets of Egypt"").  Some nice interior views of 3 or 4 tombs (I think the filming permits cost more with the more tombs you want to film so most docus only show a few).  Some great Egyptologists are interviewed and it has a great score.  The only trouble I have with it is that their boast of using ""ground breaking computer graphics"" while visually impressive is completely inaccurate in what they show.  Not a single tomb depicted is accurately rendered.  Most of the network of tombs (seen in 'underground flyby' style) are just copies of KV 17 (Seti I) seen from different angles.  They don't actually show all or even most of the tombs.  And al the tombs they did try to render aren't right.  KV5 is missing chambers that were mapped well before this show was made, KVq7 is missing pillars in two chamber and the tunnel under the burial chamber, KV62 (Tut) has him the wrong way round in his sarcophagus, and so on.  The BBC series does a better job with this but it also has similar problem.  That being said, I still watch this show form time to time as it is pretty fun and engaging.  Definately worth getting if you're not looking for something to accurately depict the Valley's tombs in computer graphics.",1267920000,8,1334,4.448559670781893
7982717,5,B00008G6JW,"Journey Through the Valley of the Kings is an excellent documentary which brings to the screen the final resting place of Egypt's Pharaohs: The Valley of the Kings.
The amount of effort and research put into this project is evident and as a result the documentary helps transport the viewer to another time allowing one to lay eyes on architectural marvels that have been hidden from view for thousands of years.
Shot on location, Kent Weeks does a great job of presenting the actual setting for these magnificent monuments and structures.
Journey Through the Valley of the Kings is strongly recommended to all those with a soft spot for all things Egyptian. 5 Stars",1217808000,4,666,4.850877192982456
