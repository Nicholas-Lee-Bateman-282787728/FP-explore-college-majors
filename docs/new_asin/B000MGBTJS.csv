8168758,2,B000MGBTJS,"Watching this disk is like reading a really dull high-school level history book or watching a *really* bad stage production.  The narrator is as exciting as a mashed-potato sandwich and his script has had all controversy removed from it.  The acting/reenactments are between not good and laughable.  (As another reviewer commented, Saladin's dialog is so bad you will be rushing for the mute button.)  Another down side is that the sound mastering is so bad that it is very difficult to hear the narrator over the fake sounds of battle in many places.  On the plus side there are lots of facts and neither the Christians nor the Muslims are portrayed as the ""hero.""  If you want a very ""safe"" introduction to the first couple crusades, where the atrocities committed by both sides are mentioned but sterilized, this may be an alright disk for you but there is a LOT to dislike here.",1276387200,2,882,4.73202614379085

I know that one doesn't turn to documentaries to witness high level acting and production values, but both were very weak here.  On a positive note, it's so bad that you might find it amusing.  Actors portray various participants in the Crusades, such as a knight, Saladin, and Richard the Third.  The monologues were very poor, with the award for weakest going to the actor portraying Saladin.  In addition to a noncredible reading, this actor attempted an accent that was all over the map, even lapsing into one that was almost a brogue.  Makeup was poor. The battle scenes could hardly have been worse.

I did give this DVD two stars because it does have some informational value.  Yet even that is incomplete and sketchy.  For instance, the narrator tells us that we can only ""speculate"" as to why citizens signed up for the First Crusade, almost as if this act is a complete mystery.  While we can never know why each individual participant joined the mission, we do know that Pope Urban II promised remission of sins to all participants. This would have been a heady incentive in 1096.  Add to that the real chance of material gain by plunder, and you have two pretty good motivators.  Another example is in the discussion of the Third Crusade, when we are told that Saladin and Richard the Third negotiated an ""uneasy"" truce, without discussion as to why this truce was ""uneasy"".  The reason it was ""uneasy"" is the most interesting part.  Richard the Third and Saladin were both exceptional leaders.  They came to believe that Christians and Muslims could live together in Jerusalem in peace, but that position was met with resistance from the citizens.  Who knows where we would be today had the citizens gone along and given peace a chance?

The producers of this DVD also chose to end the discussion with the Third Crusade.  Their reasoning, I assume from the narrative, is that this was the last crusade of Christians against Muslims.  Yet the rest of the Crusades have extreme historical importance.  The Fourth Crusade, for example, saw the Christians of the West lay siege to Constantinople, and slaughter fellow Christians. This event created a division between Latin and Greek churches that still exists today.  The remainder of the Crusades were Christian against Christian, with the mainstream Catholic church putting down heretical movements, such as in the Albigensian Crusades.

If you are looking for a quick thumbnail sketch of the first three crusades, and aren't bothered by poor dramatization, you might like this DVD.  Otherwise, I suggest that you steer clear.",1181692800,8,2796,4.93576017130621
