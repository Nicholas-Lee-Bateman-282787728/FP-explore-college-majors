3978536,4,B002SAJ6EQ,"As an aspiring mystery author, Val McDermid is on my short list of literary heroes.  The author best known for the gritty contemporary series ""Wire in the Blood"" tried her hand at a throwback to the 'English village cosy' structure with ""A Place of Execution"".  Enough time had elapsed since reading the novel that I could enjoy this screen adaptation on its own merits.  Changes have been made from McDermid's original story, but the whole still feels familiar and has her stamp on it.  Juliet Stevenson is the biggest name in this cast, and she is very good as Catherine Heathcote, a documentary filmmaker investigating a 45-year-old case of a missing teenage girl in rural northern England.  The whole cast is a well-oiled ensemble.  But the standout for me was Lee Ingleby as young George Bennett, who perfectly captures the Bennett of McDermid's novel--the raw, somewhat awkward new police inspector whose knowledge is still largely theoretical, catching in his very first case as lead detective, the doozy to end all doozies.  Ingleby was best-known to me as the tragic young naval officer who commits suicide in ""Master & Commander"", and is well-nigh unrecognizable in this part from the earlier one.  In some angles, he looks fleetingly rather like Tom Cruise.  I look forward to seeing more from this versatile young actor.

Another standout efffort from the BBC's partnership with Masterpiece Theatre.  The new imprint ""Masterpiece Contemporary"" is proving to be as much a success as its ""Classic"" and ""Mystery"" predecessors.  Host David Tennant (Doctor Who) brings great verve and sinister fun to his introductory segments.  I highly recommend any productions in this series.",1298937600,4,1686,5.131868131868132
3978537,5,B002SAJ6EQ,"This is another in a long line of wonderful productions from the BBC.  The story is captivating and slowly draws you in and before you know it, you are anxiously waiting for the next step down the path to the conclusion.  As with most British mysteries, there are unexpected twists along the way.  The acting is superb on all levels.  The attention to minor details in the scenery makes for a rich and rewarding viewing experience.  In the end you are left with much to think  about and a feeling a warm satisfaction.",1298419200,44,517,4.505376344086022

Pay attention to that clue because it will tell you something important about the mind-blowing conclusion of superb BBC mystery.

Shifting in time between the present and 1963 when a horrendous crime in a small village transfixed Britain, a television journalist (Juliet Stevenson) confronts the investigating detective whose dogged pursuit of the girl's stepfather propelled him into the national spotlight. Suddenly the detective clams up, after years of celebrity. Sensing a bigger story the reporter plows on. In doing so, she inadvertently stumbles on a powerful and personal truth.

Great acting, intelligent direction, and deft editing make this tale riveting.",1293408000,3,966,6.53125
3978539,3,B002SAJ6EQ,"Val McDermid is a top notch UK mystery writer. Creating Tony HIll and Carol Jordan in the WIRE IN THE BLOOD series is just one laurel for her to rest upon as she has just as many single title winners. The novel upon which this series is based, same title, is considered by most to be her crowning achievement.  Thus, it is to most viewers' horror to discover that someone had the gall to rewrite it for television!  To rewrite Val McDermid borders on the sacrilegious for mystery genre fans.

There is a missing girl in a small, small town out on the moors.  It is the late 1960s and a new detective is assigned the case.  He begins to find evidence pointing at the girl's stepfather as a possible murderer and rapist. However, the show jumps into the present day, alternately, and shows that questions remain, including doubts about the detective.  At the time, it was alleged that he had doctored incriminating photos and this aspect revives the case for a television reporter played by the wonderful Juliet Stevenson.

Stevenson is, of course, a dream cast member as are so many in this production.  There is so much going for this production which spared no effort to faithfully recreate everything from the book.  If someone had not rewritten it, this could have been an A+ effort.  As it is, it is probably a 3.5 and maybe a 4 if you never read the novel. The deviations from the novel take place in the second half of the production so, ironically, the first half is an A production.

3978540,4,B002SAJ6EQ,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

While watching Place of Execution (2009), I kept thinking that the best mysteries/psychological thrillers/police procedurals I've read or watched adapted to the screen, are British. Starting with Sir Conan Doyle and Dame Agatha Christi, the tradition of excellent mystery writers continued, just to name a few, with Dorothy Sayers, Ngaio Marsh, Ruth Rendell, Peter Robinson, and the new name for me, Val McDermid. I did not have pleasure of reading any novel by McDermid before watching the 150 minutes PBS production of her novel Place of Execution but I believe, the film is a success. The story that takes place in the past, 1963 and present, never loosens its grip. In the center of the film and the novel, there is a story of the disappearance of 13 years old girl named Alison Carter who one day left her house in the English village of Scarsdale to walk her dog in the nearby moors and never was seen again. It happened in November of 1963. In the present days, a documentary film maker, Catherine Heathcote (Juliet Stevenson) is finishing up the film about the case that shook the nation and the man who was in the center of investigation, highly respected and decorated Police Inspector, George Bennett. It was a very first case for young Bennett and the more he learned about the circumstances of the case, the more he got obsessed with the desire to find what happened to Alice and to bring her murderer to justice. Bennett with the help of a local policeman DS Tommy Clough, was able to find a suspect and to gather the evidence that had led to trial and death sentence. In the beginning, Bennett supported the production of Catherine's film but just as the film was about to be aired, something happened that made Bennett call Catherine and inform her that he wanted to withdrew because the film would make more harm than good and that ""mistakes were made"". Catherine drives to Scarsdale accompanied by her teenage 13 years old daughter Sasha to try to find out what happened and why George changed his mind so suddenly. While in Scarsdale, she tries to make the locals talk to her and to find out what secrets have been hidden behind the wall of silence.

I was riveted to the screen all the time. I was impressed by acting, the pace of film, the dark atmosphere of the horrific sordid secrets from the past that still cast the shadows on small seemingly peaceful village, by the flashbacks and by the authentic details of the time long passed.

I can't talk much about the plot without giving away the obvious similarity with one of the most famous novel written by the Queen of Mystery, Agatha Christie. Like many viewers, I figured out the guilty party very soon and it was obvious that he was guilty of the terrible crimes but was he guilty of Alison's death? If yes, why was not her body ever found? You will have to stay with this wonderful film to the end to find out along with Catherine Heathcote the truly shocking revelations. The only problem I have with the adaptation, the film shifted the focus from the original story of the Allison' disappearance investigation and the controversy of George Bennet's obsession with the case to Catherine's own problems and demons of her past. As much as I admire Juliet Stevenson's performance and her acting talent, I believe the film should have stayed faithful to the excellent book which I read after watching the film.",1283990400,20,3429,4.692691029900332
3978541,2,B002SAJ6EQ,"Loved the book...hated the television adaptation. But what else is new, I usually hate a movie or television adaptation of a novel.  When will I learn to stop watching them is a better question.  This one really sucked.  The characters and the whole tone of this production were completely unlike that of the novel.  Such a disappointment.  The producers of this trash decided to place more emphasis on a character that played a much smaller role in the second part of the novel, and decided to build the entire story around her pathetic and uninteresting life.  Then they inserted additional characters that did not appear in the book and drastically changed the plot.  The main character is now an unsympathetic twit of a woman who cares only about her career to the detriment of all else.  The wonderful story has been butchered...like a pretty woman who has a botched cosmetic surgical procedure and is now an ugly hag.",1263340800,5,923,4.7974683544303796
3978542,3,B002SAJ6EQ,"I watched A Place of Execution on Masterpiece because I had read and loved the book. For the most part, the movie version was well done. There was good casting and great performances throughout. Unfortunately, the script changed too many key elements from the book -- and these changes detracted rather than added to the story. I don't want to go into specific detail about these changes because I'd have to put in too many spoilers in order to describe them. You'll have to read the book and watch the movie for yourself to decide what you think. I suspect if I hadn't read the book first, I might have like the movie more. If you'd like to read my review of the book, it's under the Kindle version of the book (no spoilers).",1257897600,18,726,4.425373134328358
3978543,3,B002SAJ6EQ,"""A Place of Execution,"" (2009), a new television series, is based upon the outstanding, award-winning book of the same name, by Val McDermid,  a multiple prize-winning novelist who specializes in British mysteries/psychological thrillers/police procedurals, and is perhaps best-known today for her ""Wire in the Blood,"" series, currently being filmed in the United Kingdom under that title.  That series stars Robson Green, who has had a part in producing the TV series at hand, presumably for his employers at Britain's Independent Television stations (ITV).  McDermid is considered a leading light in the writing school that has come to be known as tartan noir: and what's that when it's at home, you say?  Penned by a Scot, (duh!), unusually dark, violent and bloody; and always lit - a bit--by that droll Scots sense of humor: its exemplars are McDermid, Ian Rankin, and Denise Mina.  There is nothing in the least cosy about the village of Scardale, where McDermid has set her story; but some viewers may find themselves reminded of the plot of<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Agatha-Christie-s-Murder-on-the-Orient-Express/dp/B0002I832C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Agatha Christie's Murder on the Orient Express</a>, by that other even more internationally famed mystery-writing Scotswoman, Agatha Christie, who more or less invented the British crime novel,particularly the village cosy.

The series comes to us directly from its American debut on Public Broadcasting System (PBS), and is released directly by PBS.  It is one disk, approximately 150 minutes long,with subtitles.  It stars the acclaimed Juliet Stevenson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bend-It-Like-Beckham-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JM2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bend It Like Beckham (Widescreen Edition)</a>) as Catherine Heathcote, TV journalist, looking into a famous 45-year old case: the case that McDermid's source novel centers upon.  That novel did also use a flashback and frame structure; and Heathcote, the female journo trying to explicate the case, though she was a print journalist in the book.

The case at the book's core opened in December, 1963, a freezing day in Scardale, isolated rural village in the White Peak, a place of forbidding limestone cliffs in the county Derbyshire, in the greater Manchester area, where the book's author previously worked as a journo, and now lives.  Alison Carter, 13-year old extraordinarily beautiful daughter of recently rewed Ruth Hawkin, stepdaughter of Philip Hawkin, the village's new all-powerful squire, has gone out to walk the dog and disappeared.  Detective Inspector George Bennett, just promoted and moved to the area, unluckily catches the case.  Mind you, the mystery's wrap-up felt clumsy and tacked on, and perhaps showed the relative inexperience of author McDermid then.

In the new TV treatment, Heathcote, as in the earlier book, is making a true crime treatment of the old case, for TV this time.  She gets the cooperation of the never-wed, now-retired George.  However, he suddenly learns something that shocks him, withdraws from the program, and has a severe heart attack that may leave him brain-damaged.

So we've got Heathcote frantically driving all over the country, trying to figure out what's going on.  And location photography is fine, particularly the shots standing in for Scardale.  Acting is fine.  But the filmmakers seemed to distrust the present-day pulling power of the old case, and so beefed up the contemporary material, so that the old case becomes mere backstory.  The film has also eliminated several elements that I considered important to the underlying case; understandably, they must be given some creative leeway.  But, in addition, Stevenson is known for her ability to play intense, and the script sure gives her intense.  She is a ""crap mother,"" with a difficult relationship with her daughter Sasha, played by Elizabeth Day; and her own novelist mother, played by Liz Moscrop.  As the story she's working on disintegrates, she worries about her ability to make the segment, is harassed by her boss Keith (Danny Sapani), while her assistant Nicola (Zoe Telford) tries to steal the show.  Meanwhile, she's getting good support from Greg Wise (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Moonstone/dp/B000AYELC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Moonstone</a>),playing the easily disliked Philip Hawkin; Lee Ingleby (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Last-Legion/dp/B000VKL6ZM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Last Legion</a>;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/George-Gently-Series-1/dp/B001B43IUS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">George Gently: Series 1</a>) as the young George Bennett, and the inimitable Philip Jackson (Chief Inspector Japp in ""Agatha Christie's Poirot"" series) as the older policeman.  Tony Maudsley does well as the young Tommy Clough, cop on the beat; familiar-faced supporting player Dave Hill gives us an older Tommy, still full of beans.  But did I care about Heathcote's relations with her mother and daughter, or her ability to get the segment on TV? No.  I cared about the story that had been reduced to backstory, the original case.  However,for those not familiar with the underlying novel, I imagine this TV treatment is suspenseful enough.",1257811200,10,5425,6.0549019607843135
3978544,4,B002SAJ6EQ,"""Place of Execution"" is based on the crime novel by Val McDermid about long-buried secrets in the English village of Scarsdale that come to light when a documentary filmmaker looks into the 40-year-old murder case that launched the career of a highly respected police officer. Catherine Heathcote (Juliet Stevenson) is nearly finished her documentary about the disappearance of 13-year-old Alison Carter in 1963, when the hero of the story, George Bennett (Philip Jackson), the Detective Inspector on the case, pulls out of the film, saying that it will ""do more harm than good -mistakes were made."" Wondering what could have prompted George's change of heart and in need of more information to complete her film, Catherine sets out to find out what went on in Scarsdale all those years ago.

The action shifts between 1963, as DI Bennett (Lee Ingleby) and DS Tommy Clough (Tony Maudsley) search for Alison, and the present day, as Catherine tries to get surviving members of the community to speak to her, while she copes with her producer and overwrought teenaged daughter. The period details add interest to the original investigation, and Lee Ingleby perfectly conveys the geekiness and determination of the detective while leaving the nuances of his motives mysterious. Greg Wise is terrifically arrogant and seductive as the accused, Alison's stepfather Philip Hawkin. Back in the present, in a supporting role, Zoe Telford makes Catherine's ambitious and unethical research assistant attractive yet detestable. The mystery itself is sensational and sordid, but attention to detail, shifting suspicions, and strong, nuanced performances make it enjoyable.",1257811200,2,1661,5.388461538461539
3978545,5,B002SAJ6EQ,"If you missed this on PBS' contemporary mystery series, it is well worth seeing.  Based on the Val MacDermid standalone novel, the story is told in past and present time.  A girl goes missing in the 1960's in a remote Derbyshire village; her case is investigated by a young inspector.  Her stepfather is found guilty, on circumstantial evidence, and is executed, though the girl's body is never found.  In present time a TV reporter, played by Juliet Stevenson, investigates the case, interviewing the original inspector, his detective sergeant and several of the townspeople.  The narrative cuts between past and present; the direction is strong, the production values high.  There is a loose end or two in the resolution.  While not quite a muddle certain things remain unexplained, though the general points are clear.  The acting is superb, the pacing far more breathless than that of the original novel (which is still strongly recommended).  Mystery buffs will note that while the story feels like 'true crime' its ending is one that Agatha Christie might have written.",1257724800,5,1075,5.097142857142857

In much of the show, it is hard to see things.  I believe that is an artistic choice in that the director doesn't want us to see clearly and wants us to be as much in the dark as the protagonist.

Things are going along quite nicely until the very end when the story and the newscaster take a 90 degree turn for a somewhat surprising end to the plot. Masterpiece movies are generally well produced, well acted, and well written, and this one is no exception. One nice thing about most Masterpiece movies is they typically end shortly after the final plot twist rather than drag on and on with a final update on all of the characters, towns, and world events shown during the movie.",1464566400,5,539,4.556701030927835

3979028,4,B002SAJ6EQ,"In the winter of 1963, a thirteen year old girl, Alison Carter, out for a walk with her dog, suddenly vanishes from her sleepy, insular English hamlet. Although there is no corpse, an unexpected discovery in a local cave brings George Bennett, the young inspector assigned to the case, to an inevitable conclusion, leading to an arrest. Despite its resolution, this case will continue to haunt Inspector Bennett for years to come.

When journalist Catherine Heathcote decides to film a documentary about that murder case, the now retired George Bennett fully cooperates initially, then suddenly has a change of heart for reasons that he refuses to share with Ms. Heathcote. Suddenly, our intrepid journalist senses that there is more to this story than meets the eye, and she sets out to unravel the secret of what really happened to Alison Carter in the winter of 1963. It is a journey of discovery that will keep the viewer riveted to the screen.

This two part Masterpiece film is based upon on the best-selling  book of the same name by Val McDermid. This book was an Edgar Award finalist and  New York Times Notable Book of the year with good reason, as it is a beautifully crafted, intriguing mystery. The film follows the book in large part but makes some rather unnecessary changes and additions that do not particularly enhance the story.

Notwithstanding this, the film is still compelling from beginning to its final denouement. There are past and present sequences that slowly unvail story. The cast is simply terrific, with Julia Stevenson the standout with her beautifully nuanced portrayal of the  conflicted journalist, Catherine Heathcote. Those who love mysteries will surely enjoy this British Masterpiece production. Moreover, if you have not yet done so, read the book, as well.",1464307200,2,1799,5.02013422818792

I didn't find the present time part of the plot line to be all that convincing and I thought the acting for this part of the plot line was forced.

I almost felt like the Julia Stevenson character was going to break out laughing as they explained it to her or maybe the producers ran out of time so just threw something together....

Although we guessed some of the things that are revealed near the end a bit sooner that the authors might have expected, there were still elements of the story that were surprises right up to the end!

A ""Place of Execution"" is not a cheerful piece, but it is well-worth watching --and the dark content is totally believable. It is the sort of story that makes one wonder--did this really happen? The entire cast makes the story almost TOO real!!",1457308800,,612,4.828571428571428

It may just be the way Amazon edited it, but the story appears to end unexpectedly and then the full credits follow.  Circumstantial evidence that the film is over.  Do not be deceived.  Move to the end of these credits and the second half of the film continues.  My guess is that it was shown in two parts by BBC and then spliced together (leaving the first credits in).  The description of the film should have noted this.

A truly excellent film of crime, psychology, the nature of circumstantial evidence, truth versus justice.",1456012800,,761,4.712121212121212

Place of Execution reminded me of the show Person of Interest.  Computers and cameras that can follow our every move.  ID cards that have to be shown everywhere you go.

What  happened at the end was completely unexpected and very emotional. I suspect this sort of thing happens all too often.

This movie is well done, typical Masterpiece Theater quality. If you like a good whodunit that keeps you guessing, then this is for you. The subject matter is NOT appropriate for children and may be disturbing for those who have suffered abuse.",1455321600,,672,4.7844827586206895

""Place of Execution"" provided me with all of the features I have grown to expect and love from their brand of storytelling; suspense, believable characters, interesting plots, dialogue, and wonderful scenery.  It's a far cry from all the ""reality"" fare that permeates American television.  Juliet Stevenson plays a TV journalist investigating the disappearance of a young girl from a country village more than 40 years ago.  Steven's character befriends a retired detective who saw the investigation through to the apprehension of the person responsible.  Or, did she?  The answer to that question stays elusive until the end.  This show gave me a chance to escape ""reality"" by being drawn into the suspense and drama that my brain craves. Great stuff!",1454976000,,809,5.2734375

The case is shown using flashbacks to the original investigation and present day interviews between the lead detective, George, and video documentarian, Catherine. The nationally known case made George's career. Catherine met him while covering war crimes trials and was inspired to tell his story.

Just before the final filming, George suddenly pulls out of the project, and Catherine is under pressure to finish immediately. She convinces her boss to let her have a few more days to finish up and uses that time to track down George, his old partner, and the original crime scene to find out why.

3980556,3,B002SAJ6EQ,"This two-part show is based on a novel by Val McDermid with the same title. The show departs from the novel in certain ways, shifting the focus from one character to another, dropping some characters all together, and changing some key plot elements. But the general plot outline is the same. The book engaged me more than the show did. But the show is good. A nice thing about the changes to the plot is that they allow people who read the book to have some uncertainty about how things will unfold.
If you see the show and sort of like it, I encourage you to read the novel. There is enough variation so that you will find some surprises. Also, the book gives a much deeper window into one of the main characters and the impact of the case on his life.
Better yet: read the book first. It's better, and it will be fresher for you if you haven't already seen the show!",1453420800,,869,4.2727272727272725

I will have to say that I was rather unimpressed with the ending of the film.  Many mysteries leave one with questions but this story's end, to me, seemed very abrupt.  I knew, from the description that it was a mystery unsolved but there just needed to be another chapter that didn't leave so many questions.  I, personally, would have seen this as a pilot to an interesting series, however, in its defense, it was very well done.",1452643200,,573,4.578431372549019

3980603,5,B002SAJ6EQ,"A Great one.  Truth and justice are not the same.  I never expected the story is that complicated and twisted.  Every time I thought that's it, I knew it, the movie went on and showed me that I was wrong.  One shocking story after another.  When I found that C.D. was one of the victim, I couldn't breathe.  Just like life itself, the right and wrong, truth and lies are blurred.

Highly recommended, definitely worth the time.",1451865600,,427,4.467532467532467

3980622,5,B002SAJ6EQ,This is an excellent adaptation as a screen presentation of a fine book by Val McDermid. I remember reading the book and seeing the Masterpiece presentation years ago but had forgotten much about the plot. The casting of Lee Ingleby as the young DI on his first potential murder case and Philip Jackson as the DI 45 years later is inspired. The acting throughout is marvelous and the character study is as interesting as the tortuous plot. The study of the seclusion on a small village where life depends on the support of the landowner is a slice of British history in itself. This is to me worth more than one viewing.,1446422400,3,620,4.544642857142857

Along the process she gets heat from her employer about deadlines and interference from a younger reporter. She then loses permission to use the most compelling interview of the pivotal investigator. Going back to see him and persuade him she makes some discoveries about missing pieces of the story which changes the entire outcome of the case. She also has to find out whether she just wants to be a reporter or a mother as well to her daughter who is rebelling because her mother was never there for her growing up. In the end there is a real twist to this story that you do not anticipate. This is a fast paced, well acted drama that keeps you wondering who the real villain is.",1436572800,,859,4.548387096774194

As always the English countryside adds a special flavour to the story. Watching the video makes me want to read the book.
The four stars instead of five is because the death sentence would not have been given for this crime in 1964 as the crime does not conform, I believe, to the homicide act in place at that time.",1436313600,,473,4.266666666666667

Spotted POE many times before while perusing Acorn media.  Decided to view it..

That was hard going down... But, other than that, my opinion is that , you will enjoy viewing Place of Execution..Will keep your interest without insulting your intelligence, except, for me, that one iota of ""tying things up neatly"" in an unbelievable package.

3980710,4,B002SAJ6EQ,"I saw part of this during a trip and was very struck by it.  Then I inadvertently started reading the book, not knowing that it was the same story until I got started. After finishing the book, I re-watched the series in the entirety.  The acting was very good- Greg Wise was fantastic as Phillip Hawkin, in particular.  Juliet Stevenson was great, as she always is.  I would say that my main complaint is the addition of huge plot points that were not in the book, and in my opinion either added nothing good to the story or were irritating because they tended to make the story dated in a weird way.

SPOILERS: I was vastly annoyed by the addition of Sasha and the conflict between her and Catherine.  Sasha was completely annoying, then seemed to turn around and be a very different kid for no particular reason.  It was, as some reviewers have said, annoying to have the much more interesting story framed in the much less interesting story in this way, as the book did not do this and was thus much more engaging.  My main annoyance, however, is reserved for the sudden discovery at the end that the reporter had been molested by Phillip Hawkin and had repressed the memory of it.  This ridiculous coincidence is not believable at all, even considering the much larger coincidence it replaces at the end of the novel.  More than that, though, it ties the story to the 'repressed memory' era, which makes it seem dated in a way that the story from the 60s didn't!  I understand the need to edit books for film adaptations, but added huge bits of plot seems very unnecessary- as if the story wasn't interesting enough!",1389139200,8,1621,4.536082474226804

Time and a tenacious woman who refuses to ""just give up"" finds out the truth to the amazement of her boss and in solving the mystery shows her daughter just who she really is behind her camera.",1367625600,,572,4.229357798165138
3980721,4,B002SAJ6EQ,"Some of the negative or less-than-glowing reviews of this film appear to be evidence of the oft-heard view that ""the movie is never as good as the book."" There are reasons why that is often the perception (Google the phrase in quotes). But if you haven't read the book and seek only a review of the film, then comparing the film to the book is not particularly informative.

The story is that of a teenage girl from a rural village who went missing while walking her dog on the moors. Her body was never found but evidence that she had been kidnapped and murdered was, as was evidence that her stepfather was responsible. Based on that evidence, and despite the absence of the girl's body, her stepfather was convicted and hanged. Fast-forward forty years to the present, when filmmaker Catherine Heathcote is reexamining the crime in a documentary for TV.  As the deadline for wrapping up her film nears, a key figure in the documentary, George Bennett, the then-young lead detective in the original investigation, whose career was launched by the case, reverses his decision to discuss the case on camera. Bennett is clearly troubled by the case, and he tells Heathcote vaguely ""mistakes were made."" Heathcote's request of her boss for more time, so she can pin down the truth, is rewarded by his pulling her from the film and replacing her with an ambitious assistant whose orders are to meet the deadline. Something was clearly amiss with the original investigation, but what? Heathcote presses ahead on her own to find out.

While I had a sense of what was troubling George Bennett, and the direction the story was heading, the film was effective in keeping me guessing at the details until nearly the end. It did so, however, in large part because of the improbability of its resolution. Now, I don't wish to exaggerate this point: I have encountered stories and resolutions that I found equally, or more, improbable in any number of episodes of highly-regarded British mystery series. (Pushing the improbability envelope seems to be the norm in mysteries and police procedurals these days.)

In summary, the quality of the production is high, and the story will hold your interest. The acting is first-rate: Juliet Stevenson is always good, and the actors who play Bennett and his partner as young men are well matched physically to the two who play them as old men (I found this to be more effective than aging the young actors with makeup). The journey to the story's resolution is satisfying even if the resolution itself is not completely so.",1367366400,,2553,4.821917808219178

3980727,5,B002SAJ6EQ,"Superb acting by the gifted Juliet Stevenson who has appeared in titles too numerous to mention. Other have summarized the plot and its twists so well that there is no need for a retelling.

I will only add that (personally) this subject hits very close to home; those who complain about the ending do so bc they are forgetting that this was an era where children were to be seen but not heard. By way of example: look at all the instances of pedophilia perpetrated by Catholic priests.

Similar to the instant lord of the manor, the parish priest had a lot of sway in the community. Going to the authorities did little to protect kids because there were few child protection statutes with teeth.(There were no mandatory reporting statutes, either).

The question to ask is not whether or not this was REALLY their only option, but rather: is it conceivable they would perceive it their only option? I think the answer is yes. Thankfully, many things have changed and sexual abuse/exploitation of children is no longer a dirty little secret to hide behind closed doors.

This film brings up a lot of troubling questions, about vigilante justice, about capital punishment and innocence, about truth vs. justice (because they are often at odds).

3980731,2,B002SAJ6EQ,"***Spoiler alert***
This film was just replayed on our local PBS station.

As several reviewers have said, the scenery is beautiful and one does feel transported back to the time period when the crime occurred.
That part of the film is well done.

It's the rest of it, filmed in the present that falls apart both in story and quality of writing, but most of all in the ending.  It just doesn't make sense.

All of the relationships in the present are fractured and the constant overwrought reactivity just gets tiresome. There's plenty of suspense in the story; this emotional overlay detracts. The bad writing is reflected in this, but even more so when people are talking or being interviewed and the next obvious question to what is being discussed is not asked or not followed up on, and this happens repeatedly.

And finally there's the coming together at the end which just doesn't seem to make sense and here is the ***spoiler***.  The solution to the problem as devised by the townspeople is bizarre to say the least....the quality of the story will live and die by whether or not this decision is in general a good one, or if not, in the explanation of why it was chosen, so that we are made to see through their eyes why they thought this was what they had to do.

But, all we get is a one line explanation, that if the townspeople tell, the authorities will come in and take their children away, and so they devised the plan they did.

Really???  Why??? I can't believe that wholesale removing of children would have been the societal norm in these circumstances.  What there a basis for this belief or were they paranoid and acted irrationally?
We aren't told.

So, for me, it was an interesting story that just made no sense at the end.....and that's what sets the good mysteries apart from the bad.",1311984000,6,1812,4.561728395061729
3980732,5,B002SAJ6EQ,"The English know how to make a beautiful, artistic film, and this one has great elements of intrigue, suspense, realism, and story surprise. The camera shots, dual time-period parallel stories, aesthetic, and acting are all excellent. You can freeze the frame at just about any point and enjoy a masterful image composition and great lighting...but I look for this, and it's never a distraction. All elements of the movie are so woven together that they create an interesting, transparent medium to paint the characters and reveal the plot, and to struggle with the main characters as they discover the secrets of the past and present.",1303862400,16,635,5.057142857142857
