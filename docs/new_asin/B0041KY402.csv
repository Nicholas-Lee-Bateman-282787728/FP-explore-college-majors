Now to the movie itself. I was rather disappointed. Jack Hawkins is one of my favorite actors, but the John Ford had everybody talking so fast you miss a lot of the dialogue. The plot doesn't help in that it jumps from one un-related crime to another in seconds. In fact all the crimes appear to be solved in super record time. I think it took about 2 minutes for the child murderer to go from identified to in-custody.

Overall, other than as a Jack Hawkins artifact it's hard to recommend this movie. Maybe it will return to TV someday, in the meantime spend $17 at your own risk!",1406246400,,815,4.285714285714286

Originally in Technicolor, the colors are not as bright as would be expected, but worth the purchase price. Wished it were a better transfer.  Even tho this version is from Italy the soundtrack is in English. Interesting to note that this film was released by MGM in black and white in the US.",1374883200,2,381,4.414285714285715
