3824320,2,B001W8FWXE,"""Il divo"" (2008) starring Toni Servillo, educates the newer
generations on the powerful Italian politician of the 1960's and
1970's that was Mr. Giulio Andreotti (""GA""). It  transcends what he
was about during those years, who he truly was as a man and leader,
how he operated, and how he fell into disfavor.

This film is in Italian, with excellent subtitles in English, is
wide-screen and professionally filmed and edited, with excellent
DVD clarity.

The  soundtrack is a mixed bag, with as many hits as misses. The
better audio numbers accompanies the classy footage of ornamented
rooms, luxurious decorations, opulent palaces, gold plated pieces
and sculptures, tiles, handcrafted furniture, high-end chandeliers
etc. Some generic, modest pop songs are played as well so the
public doesn't take all of the hot air or political oneupmanship
too seriously.

The treatment of GA is  superficial, judging a book by its cover.
The actor never fails to portray GA as an introverted intellectual
and geek, whose mind is racing 24/7 on events past and present,
never leaving his home with the exception of parties and events
related to his work. During those, he fails to enjoy himself
(dance, drink, chat, eat, gamble, flirt, etc). The story fails to
reveal GA as the brilliant leader he was over a long time, in a
hyper-competitive political field, made up of Machevellian rivals.
Instead, viewers are treated to the disease of ""condescension"" that
is the mantra of political analysis and mass media, reminiscent of
the dismissive treatment of Mussolini by critics.

Predictably, innuendo reinforces rumors of GA mob involvement -
recreating  the ""Man of Honor"" induction ceremony, spilling drops
of blood on a saint, setting fire to it and juggling it.  Those
accusations were not proven. We hear that elections in South Italy
and Sicily are won with mob influence on the public for given
candidates.  It says GA was complicit with P2 or Propaganda Due, in
between the Red Brigades violence, on no facts.

The microcosm of GA's life is shown, a world in itself, made up of
businessmen, religious leaders, political friends and foes,
colleagues summed as a closed universe,  yet everyone sharing a
unique set of values, education,  breed from not only embracing
Italian civilization, but belonging to a power elite.

GA is shown attending church, confession, insisting in having  the
Pope's rep in his power clique during private meetings,. His piety
and generosity, responsibility, natural sense of scruples  are
shown. The story indicates GA's success hinged on self-control, a
skill to mentally calculate how far he can go to favor people he
imagines as friendly to his ideology and vision, and to block
others that his intuition tells him are against - from afar and
nuanced.

In Europe, with its high concentration of people, numerous mass
media,  combined with limited education in the general public,
every rubout, hit, economic failure, anarchy, kidnapping, crime and
more is attributed to the prime minister. The story perpetuates
this fallacy, by posting a litany of rubout victims and those who
ended their own lives, over his tenure and blaming GA.

A valid point is made that the Italian justice system is more
transparent than what goes on in the streets.",1271030400,3,3268,5.097560975609756

Wow.
Wow!!

What am I doing watching so many pieces of Hollywood tripe when there are movies like this out there?

Il Divo is easily one of the most perfectly shot films I've ever had the joy of seeing. Every single frame of this beauty is a gorgeous composition, bringing to mind so many of film's greats, but adding its director's own unique eye for symmetry, depth, and phenomenal lighting effects.

Add to that an engrossing true story about the incredibly corrupt world of Italian government and its intersections with the Mafia and the Vatican, and you've got a film that rises above most every movie I've seen in the last few years, and that numbers in the hundreds. I was literally transported by many scenes in Il Divo; it reminded me again and again what a film should and can be.

The camera is almost constantly panning and zooming and moving, but always organically; it highlights the meaning of the scenes as opposed to drawing attention to itself: look at me, I'm the director! No, this is absolute mastery, every shot set up to complete gem-like flawlessness. I have seen very few films this visually impressive.

But boy I wish I spoke Italian! The subtitles take your eyes off the amazing cinematography and that's tough, especially as there is a huge amount of talking here; this topic and tale deserves it. But I will see this film many times, no doubt. Next time I'll turn the subtitles off and glory in the visual mastery here. Il Divo demands much of the viewer, but the rewards are well worth the attention paid.

Writer/director Sorrentino is a genius, and moved me in so many ways with this film. He dared tell a story few directors would touch; you could get whacked pretty fast for some of the stuff in here, but he fearlessly lays out the truth of so many ""conspiracy theories"" that have been proven complete fact over the past 30 years. He also got a splendidly crisp performance of Andreotti from Servillo, and every other actor as well.

This is the film of a man with a grand vision, and he realizes that vision to the nth degree, with so much polish and elan; nothing less than a truly brilliant mind could have put this impeccable package together. Great works of art make me feel ennobled, smarter and more aware, and I had that feeling in spades throughout Il Divo. I can't ask much more than that from a movie.

Can you tell I liked this film?

My only qualms were the few newer songs on the soundtrack, which seemed out of place with the story, especially in light of the subtle score. And the scene with the flying skateboard seemed suddenly Felliniesque and very out of place. But then again, Sorrentino's skills are so far beyond my perspective that maybe on subsequent viewings it'll all make sense.

You can talk about Tarantino and friends all you want, but for my money Paolo Sorrentino has made a film in Il Divo that blows away every other director I can think of who's working today. I kept thinking of The Godfather, Kurosawa, and Hitchcock's best during this, which happens to me almost never. That's the highest company a director can keep.

But then, I love film as much for artistry as I do for story.
Put the two together at this level and it's no less than a true masterpiece.",1263340800,,3243,4.553264604810996
3824322,4,B001W8FWXE,"Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti (Toni Servillo) had been elected to Parliament seven times since it's inception in 1946. Having served in multiple roles in the government including President of the Council of Ministers, Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, and Defense Minister, Andreotti was known by many names including ""The God Giulio,"" ""The Fox,"" ""Beelzebub,"" ""The Black Pope,"" ""The Prince of Darkness,"" ""The Hunchback,"" and others. After losing a bid for President of the Republic, Andreotti is confronted for allegedly having dealings with the mafia which, among others, led to the death of his friend Aldo Moro. Blamed for many of the ills that have befallen Italy during his times in office, Andreotti is sent to trial for his supposed mafia ties.

Il Divo won the Jury Prize at Cannes Film Festival and was released in January of 2009 to US audiences. Directed by Paolo Sorrentino, Il Divo is a look into the moral ambiguity of a man who doesn't prize relationships, only politics. Rarely does Giulio Andreotti crack a smile or show any emotion at all, but in Sorrentino's look at the man you see the effects of the emotions that eat away at him from the inside. Surrounding himself with men, good and bad, Andreotti feels that he's doing what's best for the country, even if he gets there by the improper means sometimes. While this works great for a simple character study, is this enough to get audiences beyond those that would normally watch foreign films into it?

Absolutely! Sorrentino gives the film a very stylish flare worthy of Martin Scorsese. Utilizing quick cuts, pop/ rock music, intersting titles, etc. Showing various scenes of graphic violence intercut with more mundane moments in Andreottie's life shows the difference between the calm exterior of Andreotti and the violence that possibly bubbles below leaving you to wonder if Andreotti was behind the violence as was purposed, or did he have nothing to do with it. This is one of the keys to Sorrentino's great film, while we see Andreotti as something of a soulless person for most of the film, we're never really given the filmmaker's opinion of whether Andreotti is guilty or not. Removing himself from the film, Sorrentino accomplishes something most filmmakers are unable to accomplish.

What really makes this movie though, is Toni Servillo's portrayal of Giulio Andreotti. The real trick of this performance is appearing unemotional on the surface, but also showing the current bubbling beneath the surface from past decisions that are eating away at him. In one brilliant moment in the movie, Andreotti appears to be either talking to his wife, or practicing a conversation he's going to have with her, and in essence speaks to the audience talking about things that he's done in the past that have caused people to die, and the speech is brilliant and could easily be compared to Jack Nicholson's ""You can't handle the truth..."" speech from A Few Good Men.

On the downside of the film though, it's impenetrable in the terms of politics. Il Divo doesn't really try to explain Italian politics, and while that's good to a certain extent, those of us who aren't familiar with Italian politics will get lost at times. Also the film seems more interested in being consciously stylish that it doesn't really feel like it is the political commentary that it tries to be.

But, in terms of entertainment, this movie definitely delivers. If you like political dramas, Scorsese style movies, or foreign films I highly recommend this film. It is thoroughly entertaining giving you a mix of political drama, action, and a character study of a man who would do anything for the politics of a nation.

3824324,3,B001W8FWXE,"""Il Divo,"" (2008), is an Italian-language film, written and directed by Paolo Sorrentino.  It is a biographical drama about the life of Italian Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, who had been elected to the Italian Parliament seven times since its establishment in 1946, and was ultimately declared a senator for life.  It stars Toni Servillo in the title role.  ""Il divo"" means the maestro, or master, in Italian, and is generally used in a musical sense, but this is apparently what people call the uber-powerful Andreotti, who was rumored to have connections with the Mafia, and to the murder, by the Red Brigades, of former Italian Prime Minister Aldo Moro.  Many people believe Andreotti, who is thought to be a member of P2, the powerful, illegal Italian Masonic lodge, also had a hand in the possible 1978 murder of Pope John Paul I, and the murders of Cardinal Paul Marcinkus, of Chicago, and banker Roberto Calvi, all to do with the Vatican's corrupt Banco  Ambrosiano that apparently lost Mafia money.

Servillo does an excellent job of giving us a thoroughly unattractive, evil politician; the character actors who play the supporting parts around him are excellent, as well; and the film does, of course, have subtitles, though I suspect most English speakers will have trouble, even so, with all those Italian names.  The settings, whether interiors, or around Rome, are well-done, and there's been no stinting on cars, extras, etc.  The script is witty, and wise.  However, director Sorrentino perhaps mistrusted his material, as he has chosen to fool around with flashbacks and flash-forwards; to me, this just made the movie even more difficult to follow.  And be warned, the film features a lot of blood and death, if that upsets you.  Yet, it's also got some marvelously surrealistic scenes, as those of a cat with two different colored eyes wandering the Quirino, the historic Senate building.  Undoubtedly, though, it will be a more satisfying experience for those with some familiarity with the language and history of Italy.",1260230400,9,2044,5.050595238095238

3824326,3,B001W8FWXE,"I bring perhaps a different perspective to this film since I was closely involved in Italian affairs while at the U.S. State Department in the 1970's and 1980's.  Many of the characters' names were familiar to me and I met a few of them personally including Andreotti himself as Foreign Minister and Prime Ministers Fanfani, Craxi and Spadolini.

That said, I found this film more allegorical than illuminating. I did enjoy it especially visually, and the portrayals of the physical Andreotti and his laconic philosophical above-the-fray long-range perspectives and utterances and his quietly sardonic style were exquisite.  And those ears!  A great make-up job.  Plus I enjoyed the refresher course in the Italian language.  I could follow much of the film without the captions.

Beyond those aspects though, the film was too allegorical and hard to follow.  And if it was so for me, I would imagine it would be even more so for the general American audience and even for many younger Italians.  Still, the rich visual imagery and cinematography brought back to me many memories of Italy itself from my service in her and about her at the State Department.",1257292800,9,1157,4.984375
3824327,5,B001W8FWXE,"""Il Divo"" is unusual breed of biopic, a mixture of fact and fiction, whose power is in its visual and auditory style rather than in narrative. The subject is Italy's seven-time Prime Minister Giulio Andreotti, who was associated with every major political scandal in Italy for 50 years, frequently accused of murder and mayhem, and rumored to be the true master of the P2 Masonic Lodge. Some believe him responsible for many of the 236 political murders that occurred in Italy between 1969 and 1984. Writer/director Paolo Sorrentino focuses on the early 1990s, from the beginning of Andreotti's seventh government in 1991 until his trial in 1996, during which time he lost a bid to become President and was undermined by Mafia turncoats who testified against him.

Roger Ebert described ""Il Divo"" as ""like a black comedy version of The Godfather"". I can't think of a more apt description. This is satire, though many of the events of the film actually happened. Andreotti (Toni Servillo) is almost a comically absurd character, in spite of the violence, and speaks about himself with an ironic tone. This is all the more amazing because Giulio Andreotti is still living. The Italian political system is portrayed as farce. Andreotti is a laconic man, enigmatic and apparently self-consciously so. He is known for his lack of emotion, so Paul Sorrentino felt the need to introduce some into a character that might seem wooden otherwise. Andreotti's preoccupation with the 1978 death of Aldo Moro, which troubles him in the film, is fictional as far as anyone knows.

Being unfamiliar with Italian politics, I don't know what else has been fictionalized. What captivated me about ""Il Divo"" is that it is unusually cinematic. There is not a lot of dialogue, though Andreotti's meetings with the members of his faction, the fast-talking Paolo Pomicino (Carlo Buccirosso), slow Vittorio Shardella (Massimo Popolizio), and foolish Franco Evangelisti (Flavio Bucci), are darkly hilarious. The film lacks a strong narrative thread but is visually engrossing. Luca Bigazzi's camera creeps around. The eclectic score is perfect. I was never sure what Giulio Andreotti wanted, unless it is ""perpetuating evil to guarantee good"", as he says, and ""Il Divo"" takes patience. But this is a stunning and thoughtful film, even if it doesn't try to go anywhere. In Italian with optional English subtitles.

The DVD (MPI 2009): Bonus features include 11 deleted scenes (12 min) and 3 featurettes. ""Making of Il Divo"" (30 min) interviews writer/director Sorrentino about his approach, members of the cast, producers, cinematographer Luca Bigazzi, and composer Teho Teardo. ""Special Effects Featurette"" (7 min) interviews visual effects supervisor Nicola Sganga and shows some examples of effects used to change the weather, time of day, or in the many death scenes. In ""Interview with Director Paolo Sorrentino"" (12 min), the director talks about the character of Andreotti and making a film that is both fictional and factual.

3824334,4,B001W8FWXE,"As at least one other reviewer has previously said, this is a highly impressive cinematic achievement from a technical point of view.

And yet one could say that there is a curious lack of substance to the film without being critical of it. Because the surface brilliance devoid of a centre of gravity somehow appropriately mirrors the personality and/or political philosophy  or perhaps the lack thereof  of its subject, Giulio Andreotti.

Firstly, as this is a film about a politician qua politician there is a need to say something about politics. Andreotti and his political cronies as they are portrayed in the film remind me of TS Eliots poem The Hollow Men:

We are the hollow men
We are the stuffed men
Leaning together
Headpiece filled with straw. Alas!
Our dried voices, when
We whisper together
Are quiet and meaningless
As wind in dry grass
Or rats feet over broken glass
In our dry cellar

Shape without form, shade without colour,
Paralysed force, gesture without motion 

The phrase Shape without form in Eliots poem could refer to the kind of politics that Andreotti and his Christian Democratic party represent. That is to say it could refer to the false democracy we have today not only in Italy but throughout most of the developed world.

The main reason for the existence of Andreottis Christian Democratic party was to defend capitalism against communism. However, it could be argued that to defend capitalism is to betray democracy: since exploitation, inequality and (distributive) injustice are intrinsic to capitalism, capitalism is incompatible with the principle of equality upon which democracy is based.

The film avoids any reference to this fundamental question regarding Andreottis politics and how this might militate against his moral credibility. The film instead focuses on Andreottis alleged Mafia connections and complicity in political assassinations but of course, no more than the official investigations into these matters, it can provide no answers.

Therefore, this film lacks a bit of weight for me. One reviewer above compared it favourably to the Baadar Meinhof Complex but I wouldnt agree with that assessment. I found the Baadar Meinhof film both riveting and more thought provoking from a political point of view.

On the other hand, as a character study of an individual in a powerful political position I thought The Queen with Helen Mirren, for example, was a much more compelling film in the manner in which it conveyed the isolation and loneliness of the central character. It is hard to say if this is due to Helen Mirrens outstanding acting, the fact that Andreotti is shown in the film as having a supportive wife or to his lack of substance as a human being apart from his proficiency in power politics. I think it may be a case of what Gertrude Stein said about Oakland California, Theres no there there.

However, while I preferred the other Paulo Sorrentino film that Ive seen, The Consequences of Love, I still enjoyed Il Divo with all its cinematic pyrotechnics and I would recommend it.",1431561600,,3052,5.007905138339921

Power as a game played at the highest spheres of Italian politics that after all only concerns the political caste.

Great screenplay, exceptional cinematography,interesting mixture of documentary style and highly stylized, almost Greek drama makes this political film totally contemporary and universal.
Tony Servillo - possibly the best actor in Italy and one of the best in the world makes his character - the Prime Minister of Italy Giulio Andreotti - mysterious, dangerous and in the same time a tragic figure.",1468886400,,572,5.228260869565218

8347206,5,B001W8FWXE,"In life Guilio Andreotti was an enigma. More precisely, a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma. Outwardly the most unassuming of persons, diminutive, quiet and complacent. In his obituary the Economist called him The Keeper of Secrets and a Sphinx. What did he know? According to this movie, quite a lot, maybe too much. He was apparently the puppet-master behind every major scandal or political killing in late 20th Century Italy, including the assassination of Aldo Moro.

A movie treatment of such a character could have easily failed due to the extreme blandness of the main protagonist. This movie does not. Il Divo (the divine) is the best political drama to come out in many years. It convincingly and dramatically portrays not only the sinister, secretive psyche of Andreotti, but engagingly shows the Byzantine, labyrinthine, raucous, rough and tumble nature of Italian politics, where alliances and allegiances are made and broken by the minute, and shows the complex relationships Andreotti carried out in his personal and political cohorts life. It also successfully shows how amid the chaos and uproar, Andreotti always emerged unscathed, even when he was tried for murder. The Teflon Prime Minister.

It is also a portrait of a tortured soul. Andreotti in life suffered from migraines all his professional political career. His placid external, calm demeanor and whispering voice was due no doubt that if he were to spoke too loud he would fall apart. That persona betrayed the horrorshow that lurked below. The film implies, but does not actually posit, that these migraines were the result of the tremendous conflict and pressure of being a part of so many sordid political adventures.

There is a definite surrealistic feel to this movie, a fitting complement to the character it portrays. (A possible spoiler): Andreotti apparently resorted to acupuncture treatments to treat his migraines. In the very beginning of the film the camera freezes on the face of Andreotti, his face full of needles.

This very first scene sets the tone of the entire movie. The soundtrack vacillates between pop songs and eerie tonal ambient pieces, which is entirely consistent with Andreottis creepy visage.

The movie succeeds so well because director Sorrentino has skillfully chosen to employ both documentary-like features and dramatic portrayal to the story of Guilio Andreotti. The docu-drama features of this movie feeding the audience with intermittent banners telling the story of those associated with Andreotti is absolutely necessary.  Of all of the political leaders of Western Europe, Andreotti was perhaps the most unfamiliar. He attended along with the other leaders whenever a G7 Conference was convened. But he was also the most unnoticeable among the politicians, and almost always the most diminutive figure. President Clinton and ValeryGistard DEstaing, both of whom are tall people, towered over him.

Most do not know of him, and don't know of him still, and this is the way he would have wanted it. Youll get the complete picture when seeing this movie.",1450656000,3,3086,5.209677419354839
