Bought this second volume from Amazon but received it in damage. I couldn't watch because the cd was cracked. Amazon sent it in a very simple packaging. Just in a envelope. I believe it was damage during the shipment. Ask Amazon for replacement but got refund. Stupid Amazon! So I moved to ebay. Got today. Even it much more expensive because of the International shipping cost, it doesn't bother me. Beautiful anime and thanks ebay'.",1209686400,2,571,4.5
8186257,5,B000OQF6NG,"This is a pretty good series. Dolls set to fight each other to become real choose a different path to take, at least most of them do. A lot of character development in this compared to magical girl stuff. A favotie characterisitc of mine in anime. This series is brought here thru Geonen so you may be able to get the first series but there is a second but with Geonen with draw from productions only the First volume of the Traumand series is available, you have to get imports for the rest.",1201046400,2,492,4.301075268817204

this volume of Rozen Maiden is going to rock!

the first episode that will be on this disc is the infamous ""stair wars"" episode, which is undoubtedly the funniest part of the series. Hina Ichigo and Suiseiseki declare war on each other over some dodgy dealings involving a strawberry on Hina's cake; quite a trivial thing to start a war over i'm sure you would agree, but the resulting antics as Jun and Hina baracade the 2nd floor of the house, and the highly suspect tactics used on either side, are some of the cutest and most hilarious things to be seen in anime today...

episode 6 goes back to being serious, when suigintou really starts to show her hostilities towards shinku and her crew... the fight scenes involved still aren't what i would call breathtaking, and this episode seems to be over all too quickly... but as a lead up to the final fight in volume 3, and as added plot development into Jun and what he's capable of, it works a treat...

episode 7 is continuation of the events of episode 6... it's hard to comment with out spoiling the plot for episode 6 so i won't bother... it's still pretty decent tho...

episode 8 sees the introduction of the final member of the cast in series 1, Souseiseki, who is the twin sister to Suiseiseki, and also the wielder of the gardener's shears... she's the polar opposite to her devious older sister, in that she is quiet, reserved and totally devoted to her medium.

these 4 episodes are setting the stage for the final confrontation in volume 3, where all hell is going to break loose... if you liked what you saw in volume 1, then get this, because you haven't seen nothing yet...",1182988800,5,1775,4.496894409937888
