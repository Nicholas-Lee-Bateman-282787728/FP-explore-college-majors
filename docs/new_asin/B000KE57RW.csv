8155818,3,B000KE57RW,"I have two little girls who love Christmas movies and will watch almost anything to do with Christmas. It kept my 4 year olds attention, but not my 2 year old.

8155819,5,B000KE57RW,"I purchased this for a toddler, but it is a movie for the whole family, no matter what age.  It even teaches the mice about the First Christmas and the Holy Family.  Make it a part of your holiday collection.",1296864000,7,208,4.175
