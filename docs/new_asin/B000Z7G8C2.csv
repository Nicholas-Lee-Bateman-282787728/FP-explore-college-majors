8234936,4,B000Z7G8C2,"This DVD offers you a mental mini vacation. It has a good mix of stunning scenery, historical facts about well known people who once lived there and often about the local customs of each area profiled. Yes, as the other reviewer noted the footage is all older. I'd say its from about the mid 80's judging from how the film looks and the styles of dress people are wearing, but to an Angelophile t like me,that doesn't matter. Its's just a thrill to see these places if only on a tv screen. I think it's wonderful that dvd's likes these are made and put on sale. It gives people who would love to visit but can't because of finances or life circumstances a good glimpses of the beautiful places. The only thing I'd have liked to seen differently was more updated footage but that's a small quibble.",1397865600,4,797,4.428571428571429
8234937,3,B000Z7G8C2,"Although presented as a newer video, this show is actually quite old.  I would think most of the photography was shot in the late 80s or early 90s.  My wife and I are planning a trip there so we are completely oblivious to the country and found it fun to watch the history of Scotland and see all the sights -- many which I assume has not changed in 20 or 30 years.

Detracting is how people dress, which is a clue that video is relatively old.

Still a decent little show in my opinion, but know that its dated.",1363651200,5,512,4.09
