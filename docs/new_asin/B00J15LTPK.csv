Particularly enjoyed Laura LaPlante and Montague Love, who normally played villains in silent films and later character parts through the early forties.  Definitely a great addition to any silent film fans collection.",1516147200,,368,5.421052631578948

8647242,5,B00J15LTPK,"EBay and other third-markets have bounced around copies of Paul Leni's 1929 ""The Last Warning"" for years. There is still no restored version, but this is the public domain Dandylion Records Classic Film DVD-R release. A murder is committed onstage during a performance of a play called ""The Snare"". The guilty party is never caught. The theater has been closed for five years, and now it suddenly re-opens, and the play to be presented is ""The Snare"" again! And all of the surviving original cast members are back. What's up? A clever ruse by the police to catch the killer? Why are trap doors and falling lamps putting the cast in danger? An early, classic,gothic production, ""The Last Warning"" was produced by Universal just as silent films were ending, and ""talkies"" came in. The opening credits and intro play over a muted sound track; psychedelic effects begin. The first character opens his mouth and title cards popup. Paul Leni's ""The Last Warning"" uses some dissolves and camera angles with interesting results. A newspaper headline announcing the murder transforms into a street dripping with ink. Cobwebs. Flashing lights. A dark window transforms into a learing face. Some scenes are color-tinted. The experimental sound sequences that survive are muted, and occasionally human voices in the crowd can be heard in the background. The sets are impressive, including the old Paris Opera House, built in 1925 for Universal's ""Phantom of the Opera"". This famous Stage 28 set still exists today at Universal Studios; sadly only a few wall-mounted box seats remain. The cast is headed by Laura La Plante(from Leni's ""Cat and the Canary""). And there is John Boles, who would go on to ""Frankenstein"" in 1931. Montague Love is the detective. In 1926, Love battled John Barrymore in the famous sword duel in ""Don Juan"", and he famously harrassed Ronald Coleman in 1929's ""Bulldog Drummond"". Roy D'Arcy plays Harvey Carleton. D'Arcy was chosen by Erich von Stroheim to play the nasty villain in Stroheim's 1925 ""The Merry Widow"" at MGM. Originally, von Stroheim wanted the part for himself. Perhaps an inside joke, Leni also cast three former silent-movie comics: Bert Roach, Slim Summerville, and Mack Swain. ""The Last Warning"" was directed by German-born Paul Leni, an Expressionist director and art director, who filmed ""Waxworks(1924)"", ""The Cat and the Canary(1927)"", and ""The Man Who Laughs(1928)"".  A master of Gothic horror, Leni used stylized sets, and the delicate balance between light and shade. Paul Leni died on September 2, 1929, of blood poisoning caused by an untreated ulcerated tooth. ""The Last Warning"" was his final film. The original movie ran for 89 minutes, but today's version is just over 77 minutes. The difference is a talking prologue and a few talking sequences, none of which still exist.",1415232000,12,2820,5.090712742980561
