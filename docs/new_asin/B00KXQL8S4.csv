8662531,5,B00KXQL8S4,"Great B film with wonderful character actors in supporting roles.  The usual vintage 40's fight scenes.  Pat O'Brien is terrific, projecting humanity while managing a bunch of untamed men in the oil field.  A fairly accurate peek into the world of oil wildcatting.  Rare opportunity to see Frances Farmer near the end of her brief film career.",1511654400,,343,4.964912280701754

8662533,5,B00KXQL8S4,Everytime I find some work of Frances Farmer I am full of joy. She was a complete actress and gorgeous as well.,1459209600,2,111,4.090909090909091
