6880087,4,B00QTKCP58,"Due to the massive success of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Broadchurch/dp/B00HGE90Z4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Broadchurch</a>'s first season, it was only a matter of time before a second was commissioned.

In the aftermath of twelve-year-old Daniel Lattimer's death, the close-knit community of Broadchurch is thrown into further turmoil when his killer pleads not guilty on the stand. Now faced with the indignity of a trial, the Lattimer family struggle to hold together through fresh adversity, while detectives Alec Hardy (David Tennant) and Ellie Miller (Olivia Colman) are forced to defend several blunders made during their investigation into the boy's death.

The first season of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Broadchurch/dp/B00HGE90Z4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Broadchurch</a>&nbsp;was not just a murder mystery but also a portrait of a small town rocked by tragedy and attempting to cope with all the secrets the subsequent investigation raked up. In comparison, season two is evenly divided into two distinct plotlines: one is the courtroom drama, the other is the reopening of the Sandbrook case.

Sandbrook is the investigation that saw DI Hardy disgraced after a crucial piece of evidence was stolen from his wife's car. He shouldered the blame for it, but now an opportunity has emerged that might shed new light on the death/disappearance of two young girls that has haunted him for years.

There is less emphasis on the townsfolk this time around: a few of the first season's characters are missing completely while others have significantly reduced roles, though several new actors bring in fresh blood. Charlotte Rampling and Marianne Jean-Baptiste are the prosecutor and the defendant in the Daniel Lattimer case, each with their own strengths and foibles, whilst James D'Arcy, Eve Myles and Shaun Dooley play key figures in the Sandbrook investigation. We also get to meet Hardy's ex-wife and teenage daughter; two characters who were often mentioned but never seen in the first season.

This season is not quite as riveting as the first. Events in the courtroom can get rather ludicrous at times (the defendant throws about all sorts of wild conjecture which could easily be disproved if the prosecutor bothered to try) and the Sandbrook case is so convoluted it becomes difficult to keep track of it all.

But the real appeal of the show remains intact: the incredible performances of David Tennant and Olivia Colman as Alec Hardy and Ellie Miller. Their abrasive friendship but effective teamwork is as rewarding as ever, and in this season we see a role reversal of sorts: Ellie slowly regaining her strength while Hardy's health deteriorates. Despite their ongoing irritation with each other, they've come to trust and rely on each other completely as they tackle the unsolved Sandbrook case. If there was ever a perfect example of ""fire-forged friends"", it would be these two.

And of course, all of Broadchurch's trademark features are present and accounted for: plenty of negative space, ominous figures standing against the skyline, and David Tennant striding purposefully in slow motion through the Dorset countryside.",1425513600,134,3243,5.674226804123712
6880088,2,B00QTKCP58,"The first season of ""Broadchurch"" was mystery TV at its most sublime --  the story followed both the effect of a murder on a small town, and the police investigation unfolding over several weeks.

And I admit, I expected ""Broadchurch Season 2"" to be similar in theme. Instead, the sophomore season dives into a complicated court case to determine whether the person we know is guilty IS guilty, along with the the case that originally disgraced Hardy. It's a fragmented, often overwrought season that swings wildly between things we already know (the trial) and the ridiculously convoluted, inept Sandbrook subplot.

During Joe Miller's (Matthew Gravelle) trial, he shocks everyone by pleading not guilty to the murder of Danny Latimer -- meaning that a full trial, with evidence and testimony and possible acquittal, is going to happen. This not only devastates the Latimer family -- who are expecting a baby any day now -- but Joe's soon-to-be-ex-wife Ellie (Olivia Colman), who has gone into personal and professional exile.

Beth (Jodie Whittaker) and Mark Lattimer (Andrew Buchan) desperately want to hire the brilliant former barrister Jocelyn Knight QC (Charlotte Rampling), and she agrees only because Joe has hired her vicious protege, Sharon Bishop (Marianne Jean-Baptiste). But as the weeks drag on, the residents of Broadchurch are hit by a new wave of devastating accusations from the lawyers -- of betrayal, abuse, infidelity and murder.

In the meantime, Ellie discovers that Detective Inspector Hardy (David Tennant) has been secretly hiding a woman in Broadchurch -- Claire Ripley (Eve Myles), wife of the main suspect of the disastrous Sandbrook double-murder case. Even worse, Claire's husband Lee Ashworth (James D'Arcy) is now in Broadchurch, and he's searching for his wife. This reunion inspires the ailing Hardy to focus all his energy on reopening the Sandbrook case.

One of the fascinating parts of ""Broadchurch"" was that it followed two intertwined stories -- the police investigation, and the repercussions on the townsfolk. Not only was the crime-solving very realistic, in its painstaking gathering of details and testimonies, but it felt like it happened in a real place, with realistic people. Sadly, that feeling is gone in the second season. It also has two stories... but there is absolutely no connection between them. They might as well be two different TV shows.

Since we already know who the murderer was and all the details of the case... the only suspense is whether he'll get off or not. The writers try to present the facts in a suspenseful manner, as though some new evidence will arise or a new suspect will be found... but it never does. It's effectively the first season being slowly recapped in a courtroom, only with more accusations that we already know are false (such as the claim that Ellie is having an affair with Alec).

Only a few residents of Broadchurch are involved, and they appear barely as cameos. The newspaper people, Nigel and Susan, Lucy, Tom -- all these have a small part in the court proceedings, but are otherwise absent. The new personal subplots -- Jocelyn's emnity with Sharon, her late-in-life same-sex romance with Maggie, Susan's illness -- are handled in such a rushed, halfhearted way that nothing really comes of them.

Only the Reverend Coates gets any real screentime, mostly to ineffectually urge Joe to reverse his plea, and then just sort of hang around looking sad. The only townsfolk who get any attention are the Lattimers, and that is mainly so Beth can vent her rage on Ellie and Mark, and Mark can sit around being repressed.

The whole court case might not have been so bad had we been presented with a good murder case... but we're not. It's hard to care about thee Sandbrook case, since there is no emotional stake. The victims aren't introduced as human beings until the final episode (when we see a flashback of them alive), and the parents are barely introduced, let alone developed. It's a big seething mess of lies, obvious lies, more lies, convoluted plot twists, and a crime so ridiculous that it borders on farce.

The one saving grace of this series is the acting: Tennant and Colman still have excellent chemistry, and Tennant gets to show more fire and intensity (and brogue!) as he throws himself into a case he's actually passionate about. Rampling has a quiet dignity as an aging barrister who, frankly, does a pretty awful job in court. D'Arcy is excellent as a menacing, muscular man overshadowed by a murder, and Myles is similarly great as a devious liar who may be using Alec for her own ends.

After the perfection of the first season, ""Broadchurch Season Two"" is a flop -- two disconnected stories, neither of which work. It would have been better to just have a new crime to solve, rather than a torturous recap and a halfhearted cold case.",1424736000,26,4858,4.939950980392157

6880106,4,B00QTKCP58,"Broadchurch season 2 Is not a series worth watching. Season 2 with the trial of Joe Miller was so horrendously painstakingly saw that it drove me nuts.

David Tennants D.I. Alec Hardy and Olivia Colmans D.S. Ellie Miller are working together again, in this season. Olivia is trying to get through life without her lowlife husband, Joe. Her father is babysitting which is a big help to her. Alec is trying to find his place, and is looked at wearily by the town. His daughter Is not aching to get to know him. So. On the home front, not much is going well. Now, onward to The trial.

 Miller and Hardy are trying to be very careful with their deliberate, detective work. They are trying to be mindful of the trauma suffered by all. Very deliberately they are sorting everything out to lead them to the conclusion of the trial.

The other members of the town known to us all have their own troubles, and we are sensitive to them all. Nothing is settled as much as seen to. The season ends with some questions, but big answers.

6880138,5,B00QTKCP58,"At the end of Season 1, the crime had been solved, the killer had confessed, and the lives of Detectives Hardy (David Tennant) and Miller (Olivia Colman) have been turned upside down professionally and personally.  Season 2, I thought, would require a whole new story -- but no!  Brilliantly, the writers set up a cunning double-plot.  In the first, the the killer of Season 1 pleads not guilty, his confession notwithstanding, and to the great consternation of all the folks in Broadchurch whose lives were harrowed in Season 1.  These characters, Hardy and Miller included, are bit-players in this plot, which is a courtroom drama that features the formidable presences of Charlotte Rampling (for the prosecution) and Marianne Jean-Baptiste (for the defense).  It's worth buying the set just to see them in action. Adding to the tension, Jean-Baptiste is a former pupil of Rampling's, and there's a history between them to be dealt with, along with some significant health problems.  The trial story is stretched out through all eight episodes, and you won't be bored.

The second story brings us back to Hardy and Miller, neither professionally secure any more, and Hardy with his own health problems.  But he's given a chance to revisit the case that (you'll remember his telling us in Season 1) he badly mishandled, although with altruistic motives, and that led to his being pushed out to Broadchurch.  So another set of characters enters the story, and the writers set up a very complicated, but clearly set-out, story of Hardy's effort to do the right thing this time.  Miller, shattered by the trial, distracts herself with helping Hardy on the old case (in which she had no part whatsoever) and does a very good job.  As in the Season 1, we see again just how flawed everybody is -- how they have things to hide, even if these aren't always criminal, but hiding them leads to questions of trust and in legal actions, trust is crucial.  Anyway -- giving nothing away -- some people I know thought Season 2 was a comedown after its predecessor.  I didn't feel that -- this was every bit as engaging.",1481241600,,2107,4.819444444444445

It holds the same thrills and twists as the first season, albeit being not as huge as the season 1 reveal.

6880172,5,B00QTKCP58,"I loved both seasons... definitely on my list of essentials. Couldn't stop watching... and can't stop reflecting on it, months after.  The story is terrific and everyone in it gives stellar performances, from the leads to the smaller characters.  David Tennant is great, yes, but I have to say that Olivia Coleman's performance absolutely blew me away. She captures so much with the tiniest facial movements, eyes, jaw, mouth... The same woman who has you in stitches in all those Bruiser and Mitchell & Webb sketch comedies is an exceptionally powerful full-range actor in this very serious role. Despite David Mitchell's hysterically funny revelation (in his biography) about her urinary mishap on stage, with her unstoppable talent, I'm looking for Olivia Coleman's name on the Queen's birthday honours list before long.",1461369600,2,823,5.2748091603053435
6880173,4,B00QTKCP58,"Still an intelligent and suspenseful character study/mystery piece, but this second season lacks the complexity and the ring of truth of the first.  Incidents feel a bit more convenient or manufactured, a few of the twists are disappointingly obvious and theres less of an organic sense about the whole thing.  It's almost like you can feel the creators struggling to think up a direction to go after the 1st season and pieced one together pretty well, but it doesnt have that thrilling sense of springing out of deep inspiration.  The acting is still on a very high level, and the 5th and 6th episodes get back to the kind of amazing film-craft that the first season overflowed with.

6880220,3,B00QTKCP58,"I found the first series of Broadchurch slow, but was hooked by the mystery. With that solved, Series 2 needed to adjust to make itself even as compelling for me. I could have done with less of the narcissistic, ignorant, cruel Latimer family the first time around, but the writers, along with the fictional media in the story, seemed to think we wanted more of Beth Latimer majorly losing it all the time, becoming hysterical and lashing out at everyone in the most inappropriate times and places, with added bonus belly rubbing, plus a whole episode of her popping out a baby.  It says something about the way her character is written and/or played that Beth basically acts like a big blubbery birthing mess even when she's not in labor. Ellie Miller, at top billing with David Tennant and his neck beard, is a bit of annoying mess, too, and even gets majorly duffed up by a puddling Beth simply for Ellie being in her own house! Arrest her, Ellie, do it, she's had it coming for months!

But second fiddle Ellie plays mainly the part she was given in the first series, mainly being an average detective being an outrageously emotional mess, to Hardy, when for the most part he's doing his job and just trying to do his job without spending all his time walking on eggshells afraid he's being accidentally patronizing. The best scenes between them are when Ellie is walking Hardy home and can't hide her delight that a carnival has been set up behind the dour detective's house, and when Ellie decides she's ready to solve Sandbrook and announces she's borrowing his wall, his files, his couch, and all his milk and tea and bread. That Ellie (the one even 15-year-old Chloe Latimer described as a ""badass"" in the previous season) is the Ellie that could deal with the betrayal of her husband, keep up with with a psychically unfit wreck of a cop on a foot chase, and talk sense back into her son, who in his brooding, contrary way took his guilty dad's side.

Speaking of messy women simply taking emotional space, Eve Myles' Claire Ripley is panicky, not too bright, a liar, a crook, a sex addict with no self-control, and yet another terrible female character. David Tennant is blandly good at DI Hardy (mostly in the attractively lopsided haircut department, I'll admit), and Arthur Darvill continues to do well as Paul, the funny vicar with poor taste in women. (I must say, Darvill makes me like his character even though he does things that I don't like, such as being a vicar and sleeping with the town homewrecker, which I think is a mark of a good actor.) I wish the plot was tighter and more compelling, and that the female characters weren't so just plain awful. The pace never picks up from the first series (if anything slows down, since no new elements are added) and the slo-mo direction and extremely intrusive music are overwrought. Bright spots include soothing scenery and the psychology of everyone knowing everyone, and the one major improvement this season is  Charlotte Rampling  as as the lead proseutor who, of course, is more than she seems.",1449273600,2,3069,4.675925925925926

6880224,4,B00QTKCP58,Bit of a letdown after season one. Still great acting but juggling three story lines seemed to take away from the dramatic impact that a more focused plot could have provided.  The fact that season one was so amazing made it a hard act to follow.  Definitely worth watching though.,1449014400,,281,4.6
6880225,5,B00QTKCP58,Broadchurch was a great watch.  I loved the characters and the actors who played them.  Was glad to watch in a few days.  I think the suspense might have killed me if I had to watch week to week.  Cannot wait for season 3!,1449014400,,222,3.977272727272727
6880226,4,B00QTKCP58,"Season 2 is definitely better than Season 1.

The first thing I noticed was that someone made David Tennant take a bath and put on some clean looking clothes. His appearance is Season 1 was disgusting.

The second big improvement is the reduction of melodramatic implausible scenes and characters. The show is much more grounded and realistic this season. However, some overacting and far-fetched characterizations remain but it is TV. Honestly, a big improvement.

I find the show much easier to watch. It flows well without distractions. Overall acting and storyline have improved. Instead of watching the show with a sarcastic eye, I am more engrossed and forget I am watching.

Marianne Jean-Baptiste and James D'Arcy are good additions to the show. Charlotte Rampling's character isn't very believable and in my opinion, the worst part of the show.

4 stars for the improvements.",1449014400,,884,5.153846153846154

As a procedural alone, this is a great show, but that is not where the beauty of Broadchurch lies. The character development that made the first season so addictive continues in Season 2. David Tennant and Olivia Coleman are wonderful in pretty much everything they are in, but the two of them together drive the story. It is the show's take on how each person involved in the crime and the investigation is impacted - emotionally and physically - that sets it apart from so many other crime dramas.

Season 2 abandoned so much of what made its predecessor great. In fact the only two things carried over are the stunning location and the great acting. When Season 2 was announced I read many critics who said it was a mistake--well, maybe it was, but what certainly was a mistake was revisiting Season 1 instead of finding another heart wrenching case for this town to cope with. Two episodes in and I don't really like any of these people any more--they feel contrived, as does the premise and the plot.",1446681600,,689,4.52

6880372,5,B00QTKCP58,"I've said it before but the Brits do Crime Dramas better than anyone and BROADCHURCH sails past the best to levels spectacularly high that it is one of my favorite shows of all time. Everything about BROADHCHURCH hits the mark from the writing to the mesmerizing scenery to the wonderful actors and cast of characters. Here is your normal assortment of ""pretty"" actors along with your everyday looking character actors who are often the meat of the show. Everything is stellar about BROADCHURCH.
In season one, a local boy  11-year-old boy Danny Latimer  is found murder. The small village of BROADCHURCH is in grief and chaos and everyone becomes  a suspect. In the end, the killer is the only one in town who is not a suspect--the police detective's husband.
Here is what makes BROADCHURCH so outstanding. Fans of Season 1 will think the first season was wrapped up tight and the murder solved. In most crime series, there's a new case in the new season and it's true with BROADCHURCH, but wait, we're not finished with Season One's murder.  The past is never buried in Broadchurch and the inhabitants are going to relive their trauma over and over. The Latimer's much relieve their private drama in front of the town once again.
Season 2 brings us new characters such as Jocelyn Knight, prosecution attorney played by one of my favorite actresses Charlotte Rampling. Her former protege Sharon Bishop (talented Marianne Jean-Baptist) is now her nemesis as the brutal defense attorney, will  use any means to free her client..even if he is guilty. It does not get better than BROADCHURCH with its secrets and twists revealed. Watch and you will be addicted to this amazing drama.
Detective Ellie Miller (Olivia Colman) must deal with her shattered family knowing her loving husband was a pedophile and murderer.  Detective Alec Hardy (David Tennant) must relive a previous failed murder investigation, The Sandbrook Case. Two girls, presumed murdered, and the likely suspect was acquitted. This case introduces us to two sexy  actors James D'Arcy as Lee Ashworth and  Eve Myles as his wife Clair. Hardy is hiding Claire from her supposed murderous husband Lee, yet the two reunite and their passion and sex is hot and steamy. Here is another story where nothing and no one are as they seem. The writers know how to weave a story of suspense and mystery. Maybe the missing girls are still alive. Maybe Lee is not the killer or maybe he is. We wonder as Claire continually changes her story about the night the girls disappeared.
BROADCHURCH has it all--crime, murder, mystery, and suspense in a gorgeous setting. The photography alone will make you want more. It is all stunning. This show is by far one of the best crime dramas ever created. The haunting music, the haunting scenery and the haunting actors will send chills down your spin. Don't miss this show.",1441152000,,2862,4.862422997946612

I ordered this series through Amazon Prime and a couple of the seasons I could not get subtitles, which I really needed with the Scottish accent. After watching the last episode I had to go online to see what happened.  Altogether disappointing, and,very doubtful that I will watch,third season.",1439856000,,467,4.961538461538462

6880407,4,B00QTKCP58,"BROADCHURCH Season 1 is an outstanding series offered by NETFLIX (5 out of 5 Stars, in my opinion). I immediately wanted to see Season 2, then learned that it is available on Amazon. I needed to watch Season 2 now. BROADCHURCH is that good, especially if you like British detective stories, having some depth in character and a mood that David Tennant gives in the the role of DI Hardy. So far, after two (2) episodes, I found it not as good as Season 1, but still very interesting to watch (perhaps 4 out 5 Stars). There is a plus in Season 2 having TORCHWOOD star Eve Myles join the cast, playing a pivotal role. I will post a rating after finishing the series.",1439683200,,663,4.354838709677419

6880413,5,B00QTKCP58,"I was happy to see my old friend's from Torchwood!  As usual the acting is outstanding from the entire cast - I love Charlotte Rampling!  Seeing David Tennent's character as ""weak as a kitten"" was very believable & bizarre to see him so convincingly sickly(some actors are either so over the top or too inconsistent in their ""weakness"".  (I hate when actor's cough when they're sick/dying/injured with something that would NEVER cause anyone to cough!  I'm an RN, it's just a pet peeve!)
However, I thought the first season was a bit more crisp.  The 2nd had a few too many ""leaps of faith"", where I thought I must of missed an episode somewhere along the way, so I watched a couple of them twice!  It's still a fantastic show & I highly recommend it!",1439596800,,751,4.525925925925926

6880444,5,B00QTKCP58,"I thought the original season of Broadchurch was absolutely incredible.  I loved the actors, love the location and thought that the story was very compelling.  Season 2 starts right where Season 1 ended. In my opinion, Season 1 was better, but I still loved this Season too, and feel that my money was well spent.  The show follows the continuing breakdown following Danny Latimer's murder, and is based in a fictional town of Broadchurch in Dorset, England.  The scenery is spectacular, just like in Season 1.  David Tennant is again brilliant (as always) and Olivia Coleman is also incredibly talented. Season 2 includes new actors that were equally brilliant: Charlotte Rampling, and Marianne Jean-Baptiste as opposing barristers, both equally talented and fierce.  Well written, tense, fascinating to watch. If you liked the first season, this is definitely a must see for you. Season 3 has been approved, and I am looking forward to it.",1438473600,2,941,5.077922077922078

Joe Miller decides to plead not guilty to the shock and horror of his now-estranged wife, the Latimer family, and the town. The season is complicated through a series of flashbacks to the crime that destroyed Alec Hardy's reputation. Both of these plot lines are fantastically engaging through their twists and turns.

The ending is rather unexpected, but not as stirring as in the first mini-series.  In ways it is a throwback--a great thing!--to those mysteries of the past, before the labs and gadgets took over.  It is character driven and many of the characters are not that likable, which is life itself.  I did detect a scent of political correctness creep in, but just a scent, not a downright smell.

While the story line for each of the two seasons is pretty simple,  character development is quite good and the photography is excellent.  Exploring human nature and the impact of a situation upon unique individuals seems the strength of the series here.  Each season is tidily concluded without cutting off the possibility for another season.  For those who enjoy looking for those things in movies, there are a few scenes that don't follow well--i.e.  the character in prior scene could not really be in the next scene unless teletransported.  An occasional prop out of place or different from one scene to the next.  Not many, but enough to add amusement to the mix.

Great admiration for Olivia Coleman and, of course, David Tennant and it was nice to again see Charlotte Rampling (Georgy Girl, The Night Porter).

6880553,4,B00QTKCP58,"After the harrowing investigation of the death of a eleven-year old Daniel Latimer in the English coastal town of Broadchurch in the first series, the second series focuses on the trial of the guy who confessed to the crime. In the first episode, he enters his plea: not guilty. Everyone (including his defense attorney) is surprised. New legal teams are brought in for both sides. The defense has a win-at-all-costs young lawyer who is rather cynical about the justice system (with many reasons revealed through subsequent episodes). The prosecution has an older female barrister from Broadchurch come out of retirement to win one last case for the hometown. Sparks fly and more secrets are revealed as they spar over the truth and the possibilities of what happened the night of Daniel Latimer's death.

Meanwhile, new developments are happening in Alec Hardy's (well played by David Tennant) previous case, the one where things fell apart and it drove him to Broadchurch as a refuge. The prime suspect is back in the country and is trying to find his wife, who's been hiding in a cottage provided by Hardy. The old case starts to blow wide open, giving Hardy a chance to redeem himself for the botched case. Like the Broadchurch case, Hardy's case is much more complicated than it seems.

The acting and writing are excellent again, as is the cinematography. Viewers will have an easy time getting sucked into watching multiple episodes in one evening. The show does have one surprise relationship come up at the end that felt like shoe-horning in some politically correct content rather than actually contributing to the story or the theme. Otherwise this is a great show and a worthy successor to the first series.",1435449600,,1719,4.924137931034482

There are two parallel stories going on, one was slightly developed in the first season (Sambrook) and comes to full development in the second season.

But suffice it to say, the entire town of Broadchurch is involved in a difficult trial, while Alec and Miller become involved in solving another case.  The two cases become entwined and introduce the audience to several new outside characters.  The actor who plays a London barrister is sensational!!!

6880587,4,B00QTKCP58,"More scenes of an adult nature in it than I remember in the first season which didn't seem necessary (this show is not for kids), but overall... the acting was still amazing, the characters so well developed, and the plot grabbed hold of you like a vice grip until you made it to the finale. Love David Tennant in this one (with his natural Scottish accent!). Loved Olivia Colman and Jodie Whittaker and the way they showed their characters fighting back against the overwhelming tragedies in their life. Really grew to love Andrew Buchan as he grew into his role as a father. Can't wait to see what they do for Season 3.",1434585600,,621,4.504424778761062

6880590,4,B00QTKCP58,"Incredibly suspenseful. I'll try not to give too much away for anyone who hasn't yet seen Season 1.
Although last seasons suspect pleaded guilty, he now reverses his plea in court making for a tense and suspenseful case. Did he do it or did he confess under duress, or, as I thought,  is he protecting someone, perhaps his young son, who might have something to do with the murder? The tension builds as the court case unfolds, as does the personal drama between the two opposing attorneys, once mentor and mentee. Charlotte Rampling plays the former, a brilliant prosecutor, now a recluse who comes out of hiding on behalf of  the dead boy's family. Here she is a model of decorum and restraint, but under her steely exterior there lurks a loving heart, though it is not extended to her adversary, a single mother whose son is in prison.

The second storyline brings back the double child murders that have haunted DI Hardy and almost ruined his career. When his prime suspect returns from France, Hardy decides to resolve the case once and for all with the help of his former partner Ellie Miller. But here too, things are not as they seem. Is the prime suspect guilty, is he dangerous to his wife, a woman who Hardy has been sheltering, or is he a dupe caught in her machinations? Again, here the writers, and particularly, the composer build an enormous amount of tension as the story unfolds.

To me the pleasure of this series was not so much in its resolution, one satisfying , the other somewhat of a let down, but in the joy of speculation, of wondering what really happened and who done it. Still, as in season 1 the characters were well drawn and fully fleshed out by the actors, particularly the long suffering Ellie Miller, played by Olivia Coleman who is so incredibly expressive and understated in her role as a woman whose life ha been shattered, and the prosecutor, played by Charlotte Rampling.",1434585600,6,1912,4.631268436578171

6880612,5,B00QTKCP58,"I am completely biased about this series. So take what I say with a grain of salt.  I have 10 minutes left to watch of the final episode and I can't bear it to end. (So, I am saving it)  It has everything I love. I adore the cinematography, I adore the soundtrack. I would watch David Tennant and Olivia Colman read the dictionary to each other...wouldn't that be exciting? If, they don't make a series 3 (and I mean SOON) I will have to re watch 1 and 2 again!!! I think maybe 2 was a little far fetched plot wise...but I am completely addicted and my life is just a dim shadow now. I hope there is a Broadchurch Season 25 some day...

6880616,5,B00QTKCP58,"David Tennant's accent is to die for and they should have let him keep it for Doctor Who. Also, this series is just *pretty*. It's visually arresting because of where it's shot, of course, but the cinematography is fantastic. And the story is simple but deep enough to keep you watching. Actually, if you really think about it, the two seasons of this show could really have been smooshed down into no more than two episodes of CSI in the United States, with a couple good ""lab investigation montage"" scenes and if you cut out all of the character development. That's how we roll in the US, but I'm very glad it isn't what happened here.",1433980800,4,637,4.5

6880628,4,B00QTKCP58,"Anyone who watched the first season of Broadchurch would have to agree that it was a compelling, surprising and well-done series.  It was by far one of our favorites.  When we learned that it was available for rental/purchase on Amazon we rushed to get it and went on a week-long binge of the second season.  In the second season they begin to tell two stories at the same time which makes it less focused and, at times, confusing. The introduction of new characters was necessary but one must ask why was there no mention of them in the first season.  They seemed an important element.  Nonetheless, it was again a powerful and riveting story and has a great ending with a positive outcome.  So many movies leave one hanging.  A strong recommendation to rent/purchase. One note of caution... the dialect sometimes made it necessary for one to turn on the closed captioning feature to clearly understand what was being said. Enjoy!",1433721600,3,931,4.745341614906832

Gone are the scenes where people stare into space for ridiculous amounts of time! There is a LOT going on this season and I won't spoil anything but it was great to get the story of the Sandbrook case and see Hardy get closure from that. The cast is great but once again David Tennant and Olivia  Colman overshadow the rest and give performances worthy of any award given to them. I'm not sure where series three will go but I look forward to it. A side note- if you haven't watched Gracepoint I wouldn't go out of my way do so.

It's like a JK Rowling novel: all of the characters are so well-developed, and their lives so intertwined, the plot and character arcs are composed like a symphony.

So many of this crew and cast are carry overs from Doctor Who which makes it even more fun to watch.  Enjoy Arthur Darvil.  Anything Chris writes is excellent.  Also like Euros Lyn direction.  Yes, I am a whovian, but it does not diminish the fact that his was excellent and looking forward to Season 3.",1432944000,,449,4.55

6880713,5,B00QTKCP58,"Everything about this series is brilliant, especially the writing. The second season is even better than the first in that regard. The writer was especially clever in having the defense attorney use plot elements from the first year to create reasonable doubt for the jury.

I do have a question that arises from a possible difference between the British and American judicial systems. Would the prosecutor really have made the cornerstone of her opening statement a suggestion that the defendant's decision not to testify was an indication of guilt? Would that be considered ethical or even permissible? Even though the judge gave a jury instruction contradicting it, I hope it wouldn't be allowed and I especially think the attorney in this case would have more class than to use it.",1432771200,3,785,5.038461538461538

6880716,5,B00QTKCP58,"I've watched David Tennant in everything I've been able to; from Hamlet (with Tennant starring opposite Patrick Stewart) to The Decoy Bride to Doctor Who.  I am an appreciator of his craft and this was my main reason for watching this series.  Tennant isn't the only (reason to watch and) gifted actor in this series as it is filled with a solid supporting cast.  In addition to excellent acting, the story has been solidly written and executed.  I wouldn't call this series ""gripping,"" but it is definitely dramatic, suspenseful, emotional, and highly charged.  I found the first season to be a bit slow and unsteady on its feet, but by the second season this series definitely has found itself.  The characters are brilliantly faced with struggles and moral choices that have no clear, black-white answers; often only the grey areas being the better choice but always leaving a bitter taste in their mouths.  It's much like they're lose-lose scenarios for all involved; yet the characters do persevere (though too miraculously and conveniently in one episode in season two.)  I do feel that season two fell short in that they attempted to force too much story into too short of a season; the story line wraps up quickly, messily, and bluntly.  All-in-all, this series is, in my opinion, superior to any crime drama broadcast currently by the American networks.  There is lots of ""R-rated"" language and situations in this series, but is otherwise ""PG""; parents pre-screen before your under-13s watch it.",1432598400,,1504,4.98

6880718,3,B00QTKCP58,"First season was quite good, despite the fact that they only got the bad guy because he got tired of hiding his crime and despite the fact that it verged on melodrama.  In the first season, there were many characters you could like.  In the second season, you lose all respect for Hardy and Beth.  No one questions the fact that Beth holds Miller responsible when she herself did not know where her 11 year old son was.  Mark cruelly drops Tom completely, who is looking for a father figure. Not enough evidence is presented for the audience to accept that the judge, who says she trusts the jury, would throw out the confession.  Courtroom scenes are very unsatisfactory.  When Miller is accused of having an affair with Hardy, we don't get to see the prosecution question her and debunk the idea. Miller and Hardy stupidly share a hotel room together.  Everybody has a tragic and melodramatic back story that beggars belief.  I finished 4 episodes and I can't stop talking back to the TV; that's how annoying it is.  I want to find out whodunnit, so I will finish it, but I am mad at the writer for doing this to characters that I loved.  Thank God Ellie is basically herself in season 2.",1432425600,5,1190,4.493023255813953

The content of the murder investigations and trial may be dark, but all the physical light and beauty, the raw power of the ocean, the drama of cliffs, sandy beaches, and green, rolling fields, seem to balance the ugliness of human failings and violence with a message of nature's sense of hope, adaptability, interconnectedness, and restorative abilities.

6880838,5,B00QTKCP58,"Season 2 is really a continuation of season one stories, which may be disappointing to some but is actually quite satisfying since it helps us really understand what happened in both of the cases involved.  The acting is terrific all around, with all characters having well-developed personalities - and flaws that make them seem suspect in various ways at various times.  The suspense was, while sometimes a bit confusing because so much was going on, also terrific and kept me guessing to the very end.  I thought that the final conclusion of the Danny Latimer case was not only a surprise but also a realistic outcome that we can all imagine turning out that way - once you know!

6880856,4,B00QTKCP58,"SPOILER ALERT:  If you have NOT seen Season One, do not read this as I give away the identity of the killer.

This series builds on Season One and follows the trial of Joe Miller, the seemingly decent family man who, shockingly, confesses to the murder of a young boy in the finale of Season One.  As Season Two opens, the confessed killer decides he cannot face jail time and, at the last minute, unexpectedly changes his plea to ""Not Guilty.""  Hence the trial.

Season Two shares most of the strengths that make Season One so gripping and memorable. The seaside setting is just as hauntingly beautiful, the acting just as powerful, and the scenes depicted alternately horrifying and heart-breaking. Once again, the makers of the series refuse to glamorize the characters, who are presented as deeply human and deeply flawed, each struggling within the unique predicament of his/her life situation. The trial takes a number of twists and turns, the characters' secret wounds are revealed in brief, tantalizing glimpses, and it all makes for very satisfying viewing.

My only reservation comes from the fact that the Sandbrook Case, DI Hardy's last case before the Broadchurch killing, moves from the shadowy background to the foreground, presumably to provide added plot material.  I found that the details of this second case, while moving, were not always clearly presented, and the solution seemed overly complex, not entirely convincing.  Additionally, scenes involving elderly lesbians kissing passionately struck me as gratuitous, possibly included for unnecessary shock value.

Nonetheless, Broadchurch II remains several cuts above what passes for crime drama on contemporary television, and is well worth watching.",1431216000,2,1724,5.285714285714286

The great advantage of that was that Netflix allows you to opt for subtitles -- extremely helpful in sorting out the various accents and dialects of the actors (David Tennant's Scottish accent is a killer).  On Netflix I can even watch Ken Burns ""Baseball"" with subtitles if I want to.  Amazon Instant Video doesn't offer that option.

6880986,1,B00QTKCP58,"The problems of abuse and extreme violence against children are one of the great shames of our 'enlightened' modern times and they should be addressed in appropriate ways whenever possible. I think the first season of Broadchurch was extremely well down and absolutely first rate acting was delivered by all involved, no matter how small the acting role. I feel all the necessary points were touched upon; a tragedy like this slams into a community and causes all the collateral damage that necessarily follows. The events as they unfolded in the second season were,unfortunately more, of the same type of tragedy and we have just reached our saturation point and found it too painful to watch anymore. All the same points could have been made without so much more additional violence to children. The troubled characters with their unfolding wickedness strain our credulity and as the show has now slid into the sensational, the characters are no longer believable, no matter how fine the acting.

The ending was conveniently written to accommodate the possible funding of another season or to constitute a finish if the money doesn't show up.
Unfortunately, this phenomenon can be observed in a number of dramas these days and seems to add a note of schizophrenia to the last episode of many series in this state of uncertainty.
 I guess there is indication that the cash is there, and I am assuming ( a dangerous thing to do.. but what the hell)that the joe miller character will be written to be  really  innocent and the true killer of danny will turn out to to be ........as we knew all along.

6881143,4,B00QTKCP58,"I enjoyed this season of Broadchurch, though not nearly as much as the first. I loved that the mistakes made by some of the characters in season one came back to rear their ugly heads, but my overall impression was that the writers tried too hard to make the show edgier and shocking, and in doing so the show lost some of its... well, for lack of a better word, some of its charm. The first season was anything but charming (at least in the traditional sense of the word), but there was some restraint displayed in some of the storylines that I found both relieving and unexpected. Season 2 gravitates towards pure shock value and features several purely unlikable characters, and the result felt cheap.

It's still certainly worth watching, but it's not the stellar followup that I was hoping for.",1430265600,,799,4.626760563380282

6881147,5,B00QTKCP58,"This story resumes almost immediately where the first left-off, with the shattered community of Broadchurch; we binged on Season One prior to watching, just for a refresher. It's quite an experience to watch both seasons consecutively! The hugely talented writer Chris Chibnall originally conceived ""Broadchurch"" as a trilogy - Season 3 is in the works! Set on the U.K.'s wind-buffeted Dorset coast, ""Broadchurch"" is a mystery series that deeply engages the audience. The narrative follows the loss and trauma following the murder of a young boy, the search for his killer, and the aftermath of the trial. DI Alec Hardy (David Tennant is superb) continues to work on the Sandbrook case, protecting a witness (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Torchwood/dp/B0050UEVJ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Torchwood</a>'s Eve Myles) who is being stalked by the enigmatic Lee Ashworth (James D'Arcy). Hardy desperately collaborates with his former partner DS Ellie Miller (Olivia Colman, whose remarkable performance in Season 1 won her the BAFTA TV Award for Best Actress). Charlotte Rampling also makes a welcome cast addition as a barrister for the prosecution.

Series One began on a hazy summer morning along the lovely Dorset coastline, during the tourist season. An 11 year old boy, Danny Latimer (Oskar McNamara), goes missing. His mother desperately searches for her son. The mystery involves an entire community, exploring bonds of trust that are tested and broken. A remarkable cast makes both seasons of ""Broadchurch"" standout. David Tennant is one of the best actors out there, all intensity and nuance. DI Hardy, buffeted by life, took the case after barely surviving the ensuing scandal in Sandbrook, where the case was bungled; the victim's parents continue to blame him for the failure. Viewers learn that there is more to his past and their's. Tragedy drives Hardy on, despite the effect on his frail health.

Olivia Colman, as DS Ellie Miller, lost out on a promotion to DI Hardy. She is also a victim, with her husband Joe having been accused of Danny's murder. She has lost her marriage and her friendship with Danny's mother, Beth Latimer (Jodie Whittaker). Her son Tom (Adam Wilson) is torn between loyalties. Wrestling with grief, Beth Latimer copes with her pregnancy and strained marriage, tumultuous since her husband Mark's (Andrew Buchan) affair with Becca Fisher (Simone McAullay). Alcoholic vicar, the Reverend Paul Coates (Arthur Darvill; glad to see he survived a thankless role in ""Doctor Who""), is quite an interesting character... Beth's frail faith is shaken to the core by the loss of her son, his absence is palpable and the trial strains everyone. Throughout, it appears Danny may have been blackmailing people; there is an undertow of darkness in Broadchurch. Miller's husband Joe (Matthew Gravelle) is oblivious to what is plea is costing the community.

The editor of the local paper, Maggie Radcliffe (Carolyn Pickles), still can't control junior reporter Olly Stevens (Jonathan Bailey); he is Ellie's nephew. It turns out she and Jocelyn Knight, Prosecution Barrister, know each other well. Susan Wright (Pauline Quirke is perfect) returns to torment plumber Nigel Carter (Joe Sims).

No matter how surrounded he is by people, DI Alec Hardy is dreadfully alone. As Broadchurch's cliffs drop dramatically to the sea, where water meets land and sky in sharp delineation, his soul seems on the cusp of a precipitous fall. He must find a way to survive. David Tennant as DI Hardy inhabits the character, a soul tormented by immense pressure, a storm within and without. Olivia Colman is superb as DS Ellie Miller, summoning a world of pain that is harrowing and remarkable to behold. You will be in suspense the entire, satisfying series. What a tightly and tautly written masterpiece. Past and present, Sandbrook and Broadchurch, are woven together; the continuity is breathtaking. This is quite the meditation on commitment, morality, and being careful of one's choices. Enjoy!",1430092800,3,4043,5.352201257861635

Somewhat like Ellie, I felt like I'd often look at Hardy during season 2 and think, ""Why should I be caring about this other case that seems to be bothering only you..??""  I was still more interested in the trial of Joe Miller and effects of the murder and trial on the characters from season 1. The finale was disappointing to me in that the shocker of Joe being found not guilty by the jury, and that aftermath of his banishing, seems almost secondary to wrapping up the Sandbrook murders.",1429747200,,597,4.427272727272728

I personally like the whole ""solve one crime over the entire season"" format, like this show, and also The Killing, and Secrets and Lies (the australian version is the best). It allows the writers to get more in-depth with the characters, I think.
  --on a side note though, I did not watch the american version of this show, (except for the end, because they said it would end different than the British version), because I thought it was just really, really weird that they cast the same actor (Tennant) in the same part, but as an american.

6881217,4,B00QTKCP58,"Not nearly as good as season one, part of the reason is unlike last season, the suspects in the 2 girls who were killed, which is thrown into season 2, but mentioned in parts of season 1, is explored but it is very, very hard to keep up with the fast talking detectives trying to shed light on the who done it while the trial, which began as the close for last season takes up all of season 2 to get through.

IMO season 2 is a more convoluted story line than last one.  It is difficult to follow the suspects actions and evidence is quickly viewed and passed over so you find yourself rewinding to pick up what was raced by you.  I realize BroadChurch only has 8 episodes a season to finish a plot, but I think if they had made you care more for Season 2's new characters instead of dodging new suspects, new murder theories, such many lies, you can't trust even the cops, it makes it less of a detective story and more of just an action adventure.

Would still recommend watching it, for the acting is of course very good and David Tennant is awesome and I think you can still find yourself interested enough to want to keep watching for what occurs every week.",1429401600,3,1163,4.248868778280543

The writers did wonderful job reintroducing the earlier unsolved missing and possibly murdered girls mystery; and the Season 1 murder trial and all the ramifications of prosecution and defense strategies and trial testimony were very engrossing!  This is very well written, well cast and well acted!  Can't wait for Season 3, and I hope they can keep the momentum up for a few more years!",1429401600,,521,4.831460674157303

And I'm doing the same thing with this season. After it ends, I'll probably watch both seasons in a row to pick up details I've missed.

We revisit events before s01's story line and the court case following last season's conclusion.  Olivia Colman is still the stand-out for me, but she is less invested here.  In all, the show's pacing is still great, with the story secondary to developing the characters.

But as Miller and Hardy said to each other in the between-seasons promo ""So what are we still doing here in Broadchurch?"" Now we know: the trial of the accused murderer begins, interspersed with Hardy's continuing investigation of the Sandbrook case that he was unable to solve before coming to Broadchurch. The defense and prosecuting attorneys (my American term for whatever they're called in the UK) are very strong characters as well, with their own real-life troubles outside the courtroom. And of course there's Hardy's health issues looming over everything. I hold my breath when he has to chase someone!

Seeing a second season feels like going back to visit a small town again, seeing some familiar faces, some new ones, and reconnecting with a few friends.",1428624000,22,873,5.020689655172414

6881309,5,B00QTKCP58,"I have THOROUGHLY enjoyed the second series of Broadchurch so far! I'm less impressed with the courtroom drama parts and a little tired of the murderer's guilt or innocence being dragged out, but I really enjoy the mystery of DI Hardy's last case and how it affected him. Plus I love seeing more Dr. Who/Torchwood stars involved, so I love the casting! And who knew Jarvis from Agent Carter could be so sexy, hunky, and dangerous! I'm really loving his character and that story line. And of course the central characters of David Tennant's Alec Hardy and Olivia Colman's Ellie Miller are core to my enjoyment of the show, especially the repercussions of last season and this in Ellie's life--Olivia is a champ and I love her portrayal and I love that she is so normal-looking!

Broadchurch is not always an easy show to watch, but it is thought-provoking, deeply interesting, and beautifully shot (just compare it to American-version Gracepoint--terrible!) Definitely up there with the likes of Mad Men, Breaking Bad, House of Cards, and other good current television.",1428364800,4,1068,4.966480446927374

So I did and it was worth every penny even tho the irony was that it dropped into my DVR queue the very next day!

This is a more complex story than Season 1 with the first episode of Season 2 getting off to an exciting start.  Everyone from the first season has returned but new characters have fit into the story seamlessly. I strongly recommend that you watch the first season before beginning this one or you will be thoroughly lost.,1428278400,,490,4.556818181818182

6881329,5,B00QTKCP58,Love the British stuff.  There is a uniqueness to their acting.  The men  are not all pretty boys and the women are not necessarily blondes but they can act effortlessly.  But then I am partial as I lived in the UK before coming to the US and grew up in one of the colonies.,1428105600,,274,4.018518518518518

Despite a town full of interesting characters, two uninteresting new female barrister characters are introduced and the season revolves around their case in court.  Two characters from D.I.

But it was still wonderful to watch the incredibly well written characers. By the 4th episode I was hooked on the storylines as well. Yes, storylines. It is not just a continutation of Danny's
murder, but is equally involved in DI Hardy's last case that destroyed his marriage and career. Every bit as enjoyable and addictive as the first season.",1428019200,,463,4.658536585365853

Were they hoping that by having people shout and sneer all the time that we wouldn't notice the daft script?

Before the release of the series Broadchurch, I  watched movies and plays with Tennant, and I have always found his unique artistic talent. He is able to prosper in any way and it is not repeated in any of the roles he played. In drama series Broadchurch, he played a world-weary inspector. There were moments when his character was standing on the edge of the grave, but he tirelessly tried to unravel the murder of a local boy. In the end, the ending was spectacular and emotional.

6881529,4,B00QTKCP58,"Broadchurch Season Two makes some odd choices for its subject matter. I expected it to get into wholly new material but instead the writers decided to go back into two cases our detectives had already handled. First, there is the case of Daniel Latimer, the child killed by the policewoman's husband. That case takes a whole new twist and turn as her husband decides to plead not guilty. There is thus an entire trial for season two raking over the entire case again to see if there is enough to convict him.

The other case from the past is the one that made our male detective ill and which he now tries to solve anew with his female partner. There is the neighbor he always thought was the killer and his wife, who now our detective thinks he has converted to his side. There is also the husband and wife of the murdered girl. The two detectives try tearing these adults apart to see if they can finally solve that case.

In every episode we jump between the two cases. The Danny Latimer case is entirely conducted in the courtroom whereas the other case is still with persons of interest free in the outside world. There is no particular problem jumping from one to the other but it is structurally and dramatically not very cohesive. One clear cut new case which had a well developed story arc would have been preferable.

I found the solution to the murdered girl's case almost too fantastic for belief but perhaps others will not come to that conclusion.

Charlotte Rampling plays the barrister prosecuting the defendant for the Latimer boy's murder and she is excellent throughout.

6881534,5,B00QTKCP58,"When I first saw that they were shooting a second series of Broadchurch, I wondered. I was curious about the plot. Would there be another mysterious murder in such a small town? But what they do here, with this excellent cast is take a close look at the effects of the trial on the family and the community. Our legal system is based on the UK's they're very similar. They also have highly skilled defense attorneys who are notorious for getting the seemingly guilty off by using reasonable doubt as a tool. Again the whole cast shines in this, it's chock full of some of Britain's best. The two who really sell it however are David Tennant and Olivia Colman! Seeing any of their work you're almost guaranteed high quality acting and production and this piece is no exception. There is an interesting sub plot dealing with Tennant's last, unresolved case in which an obviously guilty man went free as well. Will it happen again?",1426118400,,928,4.63030303030303

6881542,4,B00QTKCP58,Was totally enthralled with the first season and have been anxiously awaiting the second... too soon to tell yet how it will all unfold as the first episode was like taking a ride in a pinball machine...,1426032000,7,203,4.513513513513513
6881543,4,B00QTKCP58,Gritty British drama.  Great twists and turns and subplots.  No neatly tied up happy endings here.  True to life gut wrenching agony.,1425945600,,133,4.954545454545454
6881544,1,B00QTKCP58,"Like the original series, the program itself is superb. However the closed captioning, upon which my wife depends, was totally out of sync, creating an annoying distraction. We'll give it another try, but if this problem isn't corrected, we'll have to look elsewhere.",1425945600,3,267,5.232558139534884
6881545,4,B00QTKCP58,"I loved Season 1 and the first episode of Season 2 is very good too.  It's a good, believable storyline; great acting and beautiful photography.  I look forward to the remaining episodes.  It is intense for sure!",1425945600,,212,4.675675675675675

6881547,4,B00QTKCP58,Adored season one.  This looks like it could be interesting with some great actors.  I do have to say I'm shocked at storyline so far.,1425945600,,134,4.32
6881548,5,B00QTKCP58,Amazing!,1425945600,,8,8.0
6881549,3,B00QTKCP58,"For some reason I am finding it hard to ""get into"" this second season. I think I was expecting a new case and the continuation of one that was supposedly settled is bugging me. Chalk that up to being trained by routine procedurals. That said, the performances are still top notch and it still outweighs the American version. I see promise and plan to stick with it!",1425945600,9,365,4.462686567164179

6881554,5,B00QTKCP58,"Season 2 of Broadchurch is starting out better than Season 1.  Hopefully, it will continue to be as good.",1425945600,,105,4.526315789473684
6881555,5,B00QTKCP58,Wonderful pick up of the story. Immediately engrossing.,1425772800,,55,6.0
6881556,5,B00QTKCP58,Season 2 is even better than Season 1 so far. Love the inclusion of Hardy's previous murder investigation. Olivia Colman is superb. Love seeing Marianne Jean-Baptiste from Without A Trace. Looking forward to a wild ride.,1425772800,,220,5.138888888888889
6881557,3,B00QTKCP58,"Season 2 manages, somehow, to move even more slowly than Season 1, and I didn't think that was possible. Writers and directors: what were you thinking? The series has the pacing of a daytime soap opera, in which frequent pregnant pauses, rare emotional outbursts, and slow-burning social discord inch the episode along until ""Join us next time to find out if Abigail is really Jerry's long-lost daughter..."" The only thing keeping this series afloat, in my opinion, is the star-quality of its cast. Even they must find it tough going, given, as they are, material that runs the emotional gamut from A to B. Unless something surprising pops up to relieve the monotony, I think I'll save my $1.99 per episode on amazon.com and watch re-runs of Downton Abbey instead.",1425600000,7,764,4.884615384615385
6881558,5,B00QTKCP58,"I can't say enough about Broadchurch. The writing, the acting, the story and oh my the drama. It has everything I want in a show.

David Tennant (MY doctor) is an absolute favorite of mine. He makes Hardy both someone you root for and someone you scoff at. The Latimer family, while feeling great sympathy for them, have demons that can make it quite the challenge. The town, while flawed and broken, reminds me of the small, seemingly perfect places many of us like to call home that are ready to explode from the weight of scandals. Did I mention the drama?

This season adds another favorite of mine Eve Myles (Gwen Cooper on Torchwood). I was pleasantly surprised when I saw her pop up in the USA premiere Wednesday night. When pieces of her story came to light I was even more excited because I cannot wait to see what she brings to this role. Another surprise was James D'Arcy. I watched him on two shows recently, Those Who Kill and Agent Carter and was impressed. This character looks to continue that trend.

This season flies out of the gate with the pedal pressed down. One thing the American version, Gracepont, lacked was heart. I didn't care about the American family (Solanos) or Miller or even Hardy. There was no pulse, nothing that made me care. On Broadchurch, every character evokes an emotional response.

I'm biased though. I far prefer foreign television to American television. The quality, writing and acting just blows me away. If you like mystery, drama, suspense, wry humor and conflict, don't hesitate and watch Broadchurch...it will not disappoint.",1425600000,85,1578,4.769230769230769
6881559,5,B00QTKCP58,Some of the most heartwrenching drama that rings true to the human condition.  The acting is beyond powerful and often leaves me breathless watching an episode.,1425513600,7,160,5.153846153846154
6881560,5,B00QTKCP58,"Nearly perfect series!
The acting and writing are spot on. The music isn't overdone and serves to emphasize the seriousness, weariness and impending troubles to come of the characters.  And oh what gorgeous filming!! The town size and beauty of the area make the plot and subplots compelling.",1425513600,36,292,5.083333333333333
6881561,5,B00QTKCP58,"Everything about this show is perfect. The actors, the scenery, the story, the character development, just everything. The second season picks up where the first season ended with the trial of the killer. I also read that there will be a third season! Well worth your time. Highly recommended.",1425513600,4,293,5.0

8692902,2,B00QTKCP58,"This whole series is verbatim of the American one that David Tennant also did. I hated the slow reveal of how horrible everyone was was.
