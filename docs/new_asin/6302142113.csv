429479,5,6302142113,I have been watching Captin Planet and the Planeteers ever since the show came on television. I was in elementary school when the show come out. Now I am in high school and still love the show. I own almost all of the Captin  Planet figures. I own all of the vechiles. This show teaches kids and  adults about saveing the planet from pollution.,938304000,7,344,4.359375

7821680,1,6302142113,"This show and the episode stinks. The Villains are very repetitive with sterotypical names. The Wheeler guy is annoying and the rest have little to no personality. The show itself is preachy and hammers the same message over & over again like a broken record. B.T.W: how can you start a fire just by lifting your ring and saying ""fire"" and what's the deal with Ma-Ti's ring of Heart? Do they ever explain how it works and why it works on humans & animals? I give this tape a 1 out of 10.",1284422400,,487,4.247311827956989

7821683,4,6302142113,"Calling all Planeteers!!!

This is the beginning of how it all happened with Captain Planet. This movie tells of how the planeteers: Kwami, Wheeler, Linka, Gi, and Mati all got their powers.

There was only one thing that took a star off of the review I am giving: Captain Planet does not have his red feet. His feet are white. What is up with that?

So, all planeteers, remember: the Power is yours!

A fellow planeteer",1099785600,6,429,4.51948051948052
7821684,5,6302142113,"Captain Planet wasmy favorite show as a kid. It is a cool program, and I still enjoy it.it'sagreat way to teach a kid how to ""Save The World"". It's a pitty that they didn't gather all the episodes on a DVD, because buying so many video tapes is uncomfortable. When they do it, I'll be one of the firsts to buy it.",1051315200,7,313,4.064516129032258

DO NOT EVER BUY THIS OR ANYTHING ELSE OF CAPTAIN PLANET... AND WHAT THE HECK IS A PLANETEER... FIRE, EARTH, WIND, WATER, HEART, AND CHEAP...",1029283200,2,274,4.288461538461538
7821686,5,6302142113,"I have loved Captain Planet since the show first aired on TBS/Cartoon Nework. Captain Planet is so cool. The episodes are more exciting than you would think. Since the show is based on saving the planet from pollution you would think that the show would be dull and stupid. But it is a really good show.
If you haven't seen Captain Planet I suggest watching on Cartoon Network.",1028332800,9,377,4.5588235294117645
