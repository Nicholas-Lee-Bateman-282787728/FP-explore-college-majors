8351497,2,B0025ZB6H4,"A&E Biography - Mussolini, Italy's Nightmare (1987) will draw those
with a passion for history and real wartime images and news reels.

Over 50 minutes, a biographical expose of Mussolini is told,
showing his rural origins, being the son of an intelligent school
teacher mother and a maverick, outspoken and agitator or rebellious
father.

The documentary is controversial, not for it's short playing time,
but rather for a totally condescending and dismissive attitude
towards the Italian leader, almost as a clown, a poseur, an
opportunistic demagogue who by accident and disbelief became leader
of perhaps the most prestigious and sophisticated country in the
history of world.

At no time over the entire work, do the narrators refrain from
discounting Mussolini's talents, hard work, love for his country,
and belief (that he felt he was doing what was right). Indeed, the
film suggests anyone among Italy's 60 million people could have
replicated Mussolini's achievements... a big assumption.

Granted, the authors convincingly state their case that the leader
had a definite theatrical element in him, mastering from an early
age a passion for getting involved with current events in the
community, vocalizing what too many people left unsaid publicly for
fear of repercussions.  He expressed the challenges faced by people
either in person or through blistering editorials first in the
leftist ideological papers, and then to the right. He had a
populist approach, adhering to whatever direction the winds were
blowing at any particular time, to score instant high approval
numbers.

It is said that Mussolini was expelled from school, was a yard
bully, draft-dodger in WW1, carried and used a knife, was a
delinquent, often being found in local brothels. At one time, he
also had tough words for the monarchy, the government and church.
In sum, the film presents him as an agitator, stirring the pot to
become the center of attention or the main attraction.

They say that Mussolini was totally clueless and lost when called
to prepare and weigh various military options one against another,
and disparages the Italian army as ineffective, disorganized,
unequipped and demotivated.

A journalistic micro-manager, he abolished rival political parties,
personally corresponded with newspapers in critiquing positively or
negatively various news items and commentary about his government
and policies, exerting pressure in one way or another on reporters.

It suggests Hitler was a fan of Mussolini a lot before the latter
completed his 10 year term in power, and later adopted Italian
theatrical displays of power, image manipulation and nationalism in
Germany.

An open question is set in the minds of viewers, that Mussolini
never intended  to conquer or subjugate Europe with his troops, but
merely went along for the ride with Hitler, for friendship and
ideological likemindedness on the one hand, while hesitant,
reluctant and repulsed by what he saw in the German dictator on the
other. He could bring himself to rupturing the relation for fear of
retaliation by a much more lethal nation - Germany -  backed by a
superb, modern, professionally managed and equipped Wehrmacht
military institution and SS.",1261267200,,3217,5.298624754420432
