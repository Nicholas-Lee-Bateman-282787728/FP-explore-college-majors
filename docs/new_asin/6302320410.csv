452034,5,6302320410,How many people know that Goldie Hawn is an excellent dramatic actress?  This is a real suspense thriller with surprises at every turn.  John Heard makes an excellent villain.  Will keep you watching until the dramatic ending.,1502323200,3,226,5.054054054054054

452111,3,6302320410,"Well, this film could have been so much better. It held my attention until 30 minutes before the end. I truly wanted this not to disappoint me, but it did. Spoiler alert ***Come on, why didn't Goldie call the police when Heard had their daughter at the school playground? It's almost as if the director gave up right before the end. Then the movie became much too long and I fast forwarded to see if there were any surprises. No.,just silly. Back in those days, it seems cosmetic dentistry wasn't important. The ex girlfriend and Heard had awful yellowing teeth. I usually don't notice such things, but it was so obvious I became nauseous. Perhaps, boredom set in. Perhaps, I felt stupid wasting my time of 2 hours, and...",1493769600,,722,4.604651162790698

452180,4,6302320410,"SPOILER ALERT!
I saw this in the theater in 1991, while on vacation in Monterey, California.

It was a packed house, and in just nick of time to spoil it for most of the audience, I.figured out the surprise ending, and somehow it came out of my mouth......loudly. I guess watching Alfred Hitchcock every Monday night as an 8 year old, taught me a lot.  I was really drawn into the movie, and just watched it again. Of course I didn't yell that time, in the privacy of my home.  My boyfriend and I were both embarrassed, and got out of that theater fast!",1489881600,,553,4.298076923076923

452186,1,6302320410,"This is a dark movie.
Too long and dragged out.
I guessed each scene just before it happened.... I guessed the ending very early on.
It was all too obvious.
There is no comedy relief at all, not one light or happy scene.

452238,5,6302320410,"It scared me silly!  This movie was made in 1991 and Goldie was young and very beautiful!  The story moves quickly and surprises you.  The little girl must be around 16 now and she was wonderful!  John Heard ""Home Alone"" was really smooth and so very young.  It was strange following John Heard as a ""Creep"" when in ""Home Alone"" he was such a sweet fatherly type.  I loved it.  Think you will too.",1485907200,5,397,4.283783783783784

452247,5,6302320410,Goldie Hawn should have won an Oscar for this role.  John Heard was excellent as well and played a perfectly loathsome sociopath.

Ms. Hawn is her unusually superb serious self which she does naturally well. Mr. Heard is in the process of mastering his bad guy character which he will perfect in a few years and he is off to a good start here - nothing more terrifying than a killer with velvet smooth charisma.

It was well acted, a good story line and had some very good twists and turns. Although I remembered who did it,that did not stop me from enjoying it and jumping at several ""surprising""scenes.

I also agree that this was a skillfully delivered performance by Goldie Hawn, and that if you haven't ever seen this film, it's worth seeing... and even if you have already seen it -- and perhaps years ago -- it's worth revisiting.

Aspects of the plot have been conveyed in other reviews. I simply wanted to add that as of late 2013, I am among the many who consider this 1991 film still worth viewing, more than 2 decades after its release.

It's also a nice change of pace to see Goldie Hawn in a serious role, in this gradually 'unwinding', plot twist -laden thriller (the story starts out slowly, as they establish the 'base' from which an increasingly more rapid 'ride' takes place, as Goldie Hawn's character begins to 'unravel' a web of lies, while a 'creepy' factor emerges, and danger looms).",1385510400,2,1028,4.516129032258065

452802,3,6302320410,"I remember when my wife and I were dating she brought this movie to my house to watch.  At the time I was far from a Goldie Hawn fan (I didn't find her interesting, attractive or talented, but I was also sixteen so what did I know).  I had no desire to watch it but I did, for her.  I didn't really like it, but one cannot deny that parts of this film really `work'.  Even at that young age, walking in with a begrudging intolerance, I had to admit that the film has certain strengths.

Basically, the film is predictable and improbable and overly long.  But it is saved by some top notch direction and solid performances.  I really commend Damian Harris for grasping how to mold this thriller in the same vein as classic Hitchcock.  The way that the scenes are framed and captured help create a true sense of dread and tension that permeates the film, even when situations seem completely farfetched.  Hawn is also extremely good in the lead role.  As unsuspecting wife, Adrienne, she conveys so much with her eyes and body language, capturing the frightening understanding of just who she is married to.

The sad thing about `Deceived' is that it is marred by the unoriginality of its plot.  Now sure, it came out in the 90's and that marring may have more to do with the increasingly banal unoriginal recent films, but the fact still remains that we have seen this film a dozen or couple dozen or five-hundred times before and so seeing this one doesn't really do much for the average movie goer.  Still, it maintains the thrills well and even holds up, to a degree, today (I just watched this recently) so one can certainly justify giving it a watch.",1339113600,,1654,4.473333333333334

452816,3,6302320410,"I purchased this movie based on the overall excellent reviews and was a little disappointed. It's not an awful movie, but to me it was just Ok. The performances are fine and it does have its scary moments (I admit, I about jumped out of my seat a few times).  But there are so many little holes in the plot that eventually it becomes impossible to ignore them. Still, I tried, hoping that the ending would make me forget the improbable moments. But, as with the rest of the movie, the ending didn't ring true to me either (though obviously I can't explain why). I can't help thinking that a few tweaks to the screenplay could have produced a far more believable story.

This movie was recommended to me by Amazon after ordering 1991's ""Shattered"" with Tom Berenger. While both are rather obscure movies of the suspense genre, I enjoyed Shattered far more than this.",1320364800,7,865,4.574193548387097

I have been a fan from the Laugh-In days, falling in love with that ditsy blonde that just literally cracked me up!  Then came ""Private Benjamin"" and the love affair continued.  The critics were not kind with ""Protocol"", but it was a gem again showcasing that incredible comic-timing perfectionism.  But when I saw ""Deceived"", the love affair grew into respect for the talent this woman possessed, and I was possessed by the movie, loving the hell out of the twists and turns the movie provided.

The camera creeps around with the stealth of a snake at times, or like a hawk, sometimes gliding overhead, sometimes swooping in for the kill.

Nice mood-perfect lighting and sets, and my dvd had a crystal clear wide-screen transfer (specifications: widescreen 1.85:1).  Besides an optional French language track and French and Spanish subtitles though, there were no bonus features.  Unless you count Goldie Hawn's performance.  She's usually fun to watch, but I can't remember the last time I saw her shine like this.  Usually in comedic roles, she still carries her certain charm in this movie which greatly helps the overall entertainment factor.  She was fantastic, though in fact there were great performances all around from the women in this movie (her husband's friend's sister, her husband's mother, even the maid!).

The problem is finding out what really happened to him before the accident and who is killing her friends. When she finds out about it and the valuable stolen Egyptian necklace, the twists and turns into all that is hidden may have you flabbergasted, but you should be at least entertained. Fans of movies like ""Along Came A Spider"", ""Cellular"", and ""Disturbia"" should enjoy it. I recommend it for adults.",1189987200,3,657,4.672413793103448
452883,5,6302320410,"This was a great film and Goldie was wonderful in her more 'serious' role. This is actually one of my favorite Goldie films alongside Death Becomes Her. To me Deceived classifies as being in Hitchcock territory, and I think he would have definitely appreciated this. If you enjoy thrillers, this one should be in your collection because it doesn't get much better. The performances are top-notch, the writing was up to par and the suspense and mystery builds through the entire film. The musical score and the settings used were all very effective. You can watch the Siskel & Ebert review of this online. They give credit to Goldie for doing something different other than comedies. But Ebert says there was too much chasing around at the end so some may view it as being in the sub-genre of horror. I loved the ending as it was very entertaining and exciting. Had they gone more subtle, Ebert probably would have then called it anti-climatic. They also poke fun at some of the writing recalling a scene where Goldie tells someone to ""Watch out!"" Good for her. I loved that scene. One noticeable cliche' here I will mention is the cat jumping out unexpectedly, and I won't say when. But if the cat jumping out is all you're looking at, you will be missing out on an awesome thriller.

John Heard plays the psycho role very well! An original character here, not typical of other similar films.

The story starts slowly, but picks up speed nicely. Tension mounts and lies begin to be uncovered. The creepiest, skin-crawling scene I have ever seen, is when Goldie is sleeping and someone is trying to make love to her! When she wakes up, the look on her face is truly frightening!

One of the things I liked about it is that Adrienne is NOT weak or bubble-headed; that she begins to doubt when she should; that she is angry when she should be angry.  She does her detective work; she fights for herself at the end and saves herself at the end (although I don't see how she could have, in her position, shut the elevator cage behind her).

Doing less than 30 million in box office, this was not a big hit; but it is a film that holds up remarkably well 12 years after release.  Goldie Hawn does an excellent job as Adrienne Saunders, a woman who seems to have it all with a beautiful child and happy marriage.  Her husband Jack seems like the All-American father.  Then when a colleague of her husband's gets murdered, clue upon clue seems to fly up in her face until Adrienne has to confront her husband.  Then he mysteriously dies in a car accident.  Director Damian Harris who seems to thrive on thrillers such as last year's ""Mercy,"" does an amazing job of having event build upon event.  The supporting cast of characters do a great job from Jack Saunders' sister to Paul Sullivan's mother.  While this may not be a perfect film, it is a thriller that packs a wallop.  Goldie Hawn delivers an understated and believable performance as the terrorized and deceived wife.  This is a film worth discovering or revisiting a little over a decade after its release.

I don't want to give away too much of the story; suffice to say, this is a great suspenseful drama. It also has some neat eerie background music. I highly suggest buying this title on DVD and curling up in the dark. Enjoy that first screening!",1058140800,26,623,4.621621621621622

For those used to Goldie Hawn playing comedic parts, this will be quite a change, but she's excellent in the role of a wife who finds out that her husband isn't quite who she thought he was. The ending of the movie was phenomenal (I won't give it away!).

If you enjoyed the movies The Sixth Sense with Bruce Willis, Primal Fear with Richard Gere and Ed Norton, or Malice with Alec Baldwin, I think you will like this movie because it's suspensful and has a surprising ending as those movies do.

Not only she knew that not only her husband was living a lie by using a dead man's identity, but was still alive after the accident which killed a hitchiker to cover up his tracks and that he was married to another woman at the same time. On top of that, he was a serial killer who killed the curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art on the same night  he and his wife were at a cultural gala. As his wife was looking for a restroom, she came upon the dead body in his workroom.
