2681605,4,B000K144OM,"I've read threee Autobiographies on George Muller. This movie is a very short and inspirational docudrama  of his life. The narrator takes us to the historical sites where many of the pivotal changes occurred in Mr. Muller's ministry. I enjoyed the way the enactments were interspersed throughout the film which gave it a personal touch. The film  emphasized his consistent ability to believe God and trust him for all of his needs even when it seemed impossible.
He believed God for millions of dollars in his lifetime without ever asking for financial help from anyone or letting them know he was in need. Quite different from the television evangelist of the 21st century! The film informs us that his work is still actively going on today. There is a scene of previous orphans from his orphange visting his grave in 2006. One wonders what kind of life they would have had without George Muller's faith and no place to go. I enjoyed and highly recommend this film.",1287532800,14,967,4.7844311377245505
2681606,5,B000K144OM,"It seems that few of the people who have reviewed this film (on various sites) make note of the incredible contrast between what this man, George Muller, lived and witnessed the evidence of compared to what is preached and practiced in today's churches and Christian ministries.  Muller believed that anything which God has blessed and called into existence, He will also provide for - especially financially!  Muller never asked for money, never requested donations, never sent out mailers/newsletters identifying a need, never started a fund-raising campaign, never manipulated anyone to give money by sharing his own circumstances!  He chose, along with his wife, to trust only God and make their needs known only to Him.  As a result, every single one of their needs were met... often with abundance!

Over the course of his life, Muller gave away over $400,000 of his own money and supported thousands of orphans (feeding them, housing them, educating them, teaching them the Gospel, and equipping them with a trade so they could achieve in life) and he traveled to city after city (over 200,000 miles throughout the course of his ministry) sharing the Gospel, giving away tens of thousands of Bibles, sharing his life and working for the good of others - all without asking for a cent!  Muller proved with his life, year after year, that God is well able to support His work.  What an amazing testimony!  This movie does a great job of introducing us to the man in a well organized documentary with dramatic sequences throughout.  It will make you want to read up and discover more about his life and the love for God that inspired him in everything!  Religious organizations (i.e. their leadership) sometimes found it hard to align themselves with his concept of faith, because it left them without tangible controls.  It required absolute faith in God and full sincerity of heart.  Muller stuck to his convictions and didn't get dragged down by potential conflicts.  He just happily went along trusting God.  Many people were drawn to him, no doubt because the light of God's love that shone so brightly through him.

And what does this mean for many so-called ministries today?  Muller's life gives all of us something fantastic to consider.  Many believe themselves called to ""ministry"" yet they also often tangle themselves up with finances and get caught in the rut of begging for money to keep their so-called God-inspired organizations running...  They approach ""ministry"" as though it were some ""thing"" rather than what it truly is (biblically); loving and sacrificial service!  True ministry requires no money at all - only faith working through love in willing individuals who have been touched by God!  Where is the genuineness of faith in God who will supply all our needs according to His riches in glory and who is well able to support any work He calls into existence?  Perhaps it's no wonder we see so few miracles in our day...  for no one (or at least few) seems to trust God anymore;  If there is not money to finance a work, then we think such work is impossible - rather than stopping to even ask God for His blessing and trusting Him to provide if indeed He is the one who called it to be.  What if there was more of this kind of reliance upon God?  I'll just bet you we would see the same kind of incredible miracles that Muller (and others like him) experienced in his own life, not to mention the joy this man carried in his heart his entire life, even though he had his seasons of suffering.  He always had a smile on his face and to this day his work is a testimony to the faithfulness and love of God.

Great movie/documentary/drama!  Highly recommended!",1273276800,24,3689,4.766929133858268

2681608,5,B000K144OM,"The movie is quite short, and really only touches on the life of George Muller. I was inspired to learn more after watching this movie.",1220832000,4,135,4.44
2681609,5,B000K144OM,"This powerful program chronicles the inspiring life of Christian evangelist George Muller who was born in Germany in 1805 and as a young man lived a life of sin and debauchery. Hoping to turn his life around, his father sent him to the university to study divinity. At a prayer meeting, he found fulfillment in God. Muller believed that his mission was to rescue orphans from the streets of Bristol, England, by providing free housing and education. The costs were enormous for such a great work, in terms of today's money, over one hundred million pounds. But the most amazing thing about his life is that he trusted God for everything, and God always provided. Pastors wonder if they will have enough money to complete their church's building projects or finance their programs. George Muller didn't. Without pleas for public support and with no government funding, he eventually provided accommodations for thousands of orphaned children. The program alternates between dramatizations and documentary footage with a male narrator visiting various historic sites.

The film provides an accurate portrayal of the life of this man of God and impresses upon viewers the power of prayer and the trials and tribulations of a life of faith. It presents a powerful testimony of what God can do through a person who lets God have His Way, challenging believers to walk by simply putting trust in God each day for their spiritual and material needs. Featuring beautiful on-location cinematography and lovely background music, this is an absorbing and inspirational biographical profile. The DVD extras include a bonus half-hour program on the life and legacy of Muller. This docu-drama won 2007 Crown Awards for Best Picture (Silver), Best Curriculum (Bronze) and Best Documentary over $50,000 (Silver). A worthy purchase for Christians, Churches, Schools and libraries the world over.",1213315200,40,1878,5.218543046357616
2681610,5,B000K144OM,"An excellent documentary of the life and times of George Muller, a Prussian-born, English man of faith and prayer who established orphanages in Bristol, England in the 19th century. Weaving together video of on-site locations, historical pictures, narration and drama, this well-done and interesting presentation is both challenging and inspiring as one sees how God answers prayer and provides for the needs of His children who trust Him. Two extra special features: one on Muller (28 min.) and the other with interesting testimonies of some of those influenced by his work (18 min.) are also well-done and an added bonus.",1182038400,47,623,5.24

Mr. George Muller was a giant in the Faith in his time, just as King David was in his time and Noah was in his time and Avraham was in his time, the list can continue on throughout the ages. If you want to be a Godly man of Faith, be in prayer and His Word and trust Him to provide and you will see God's hand in action. You will be without need and you will find Joy in your life. You can do mighty things for God's glory if you will just trust Him. William Goldberg",1480118400,7,759,4.0

2681739,3,B000K144OM,"It was hard to know how to rate this.  I liked it but didn't think it warranted a 4 star but I can't give it a 3.5 stars so this was more accurate.  I bought this based on the other ratings that I saw posted.  It is difficult to do a docudrama.  I do appreciate the folks here giving it a shot as I think Christian history is important.

George Muller is probably not as well known as others and it could be because his legacy did not endure.  The orphanages he started are now private flats & part of the college, no longer are they orphanages.  But hearing his name in certain circles, I was curious about this movie.

WHAT I LIKED:
- Good costumes
- Decent acting
- An uplifting story

WHAT I DIDN""T LIKE:
- A bit long drawn at times
- Brief history, no real details
- Extra footage didn't really focus on Muller

I think what tips me more in to the 3 star rather than the 4 star is that the movie almost felt like a message which today can be dangerous.  If you dream it, it will happen.  I understand the importance of prayer and reliance on God.  But this movie made it seem as if you pray hard enough, have enough faith that anything can happen which isn't true.  God answers our prayers in 3 ways:  Yes, No, Later.  And we don't always get what we pray for and it isn't a indication of faith or our love for God.

In the end I wasn't won over by the story, storyline or the history of George Muller.  I don't think I will be watching this one again.",1418083200,3,1457,4.052631578947368

2681761,5,B000K144OM,"You might say that the running theme of this biographical narrative is, 'God did the impossible through George Muller.'  Admittedly, Muller was a very unlikely hero, but God was determined to get the orphans of Victorian England off the streets and cared for. This is really an amazing account of a man with a call and a mission, who raised hundreds of millions of dollars for the ministry without ever soliciting a dime. When he needed something, he just simply asked and God supplied it. There is something so liberating about simple faith and trust. This movie is very inspiring. Close, but not an exact replica of his autobiography.",1371686400,7,636,4.834862385321101

2681763,5,B000K144OM,"I first learned of George Muller when our pastor spoke about him during a recent sermon.  Being someone who doesn't have as much faith as she'd like, I was very intrigued.  I came across this DVD on Amazon, so I ordered it.  It is a great documentary about Muller's life.  It was so interesting to me how this rebellious young man turned his life completely around after attending a bible meeting with a friend.  Muller was so moved; he felt the Lord calling upon him.  Once Muller answered God's calling, God answered each and every one of Muller's prayers with unbelievable timing.  It was truly amazing to see how time and time again, God answered his prayers, whether it be food for the orphanage children or lifting the fog so Muller could stay on schedule.

It was interesting for me to note that Muller suffered great losses throughout his life, yet his faith never waivered.  He lost his son, his wife, his second wife, and his daughter, all at early ages.  In addition, he had serious health problems himself.  I do not know if Muller prayed for their individual heelings or not.  The prayers discussed in the DVD all dealt with Muller's mission for God, all of which were answered.

In addition to the 1-hour documentary, two special features are included on this DVD.  ""Muller:  A Second Look"" (28 min.) gives a further look at the man himself and ""Muller's Children"" (18 min.) features former orphans, now adults, speaking of their time at the orphanage.

I found Muller's faith to be truly inspirational and recommend this DVD.",1367798400,8,1540,4.711610486891386

I would recommend it to anyone interested in missions.,1364947200,2,343,4.483870967741935
2681766,5,B000K144OM,This was an excellent documentary. This man exhibited true faith in God that we are lacking in these days. We must learn to trust wholly upon the Lord and all his promises! This film was very encouraging and a picture of a true godly man!,1364947200,,238,4.311111111111111

2681770,5,B000K144OM,"A true ""Hero of the faith"" and I highly recommend this DVD to all people, to raise your standard of faith and understand that the Faith this man had, was not based on second-hand information or sermons--but he had a real ""relationship"" with his Savior and trusted Him explicitly with his life, and the lives of the children he was sent to be a covering for.

The history of his life, and how he started out and the change that occurred was nothing short of a miracle.

You cannot watch this DVD and not be moved to step back and examine your life and view your relationship with Jesus and your Father and be left longing for the relationship/faith journey that he embarked on, at the young age of 24. He will be considered with Biblical hero's, the likes of Job, Noah & Daniel ~ I am sure in the future that lies ahead.

An honor to watch and a wonderful example of faith.",1346976000,9,872,4.304878048780488
