190096,4,1572525525,"This DVD was an excellent biography but nearly every song Paul Robeson sang was curtailed.  This was extremely disappointing.  While it was necessary to tell his story, I already knew all of it.  Snippets do not satisfy.  Perhaps if I had watched this DVD before I bought it I should not have done so.  Yet, having said that, It is now a prized possession.  It is true that most of the scenes involving Robeson's persecution served well to draw attention to the contemptible American practice of denigrating its most world-renowned Afro-American citizens, but because the subject is Paul Robeson, That is reason enough to buy this DVD.",1375660800,2,635,4.88785046728972
190097,5,1572525525,"This is an incredible documentary about the life and career of the legendary Paul Robeson, and covers the good along with the bad.  Less than positive aspects of his life, such as how he cheated on his wife, are dealt with openly and honestly instead of being excused or glossed over.  His life really typified all that is both good and bad about America.  He was a poor African-American boy whose father urged him to make a better life for himself, and he became an all-star football player at college and did exceptionally well in school.  He could have gone on to be a very successful lawyer after graduation, but was forced to find another occupation because of the institutionalised racism of the time, even up in the North.  Robeson found success in everything he did after this stinging rejection, whether he were singing, acting onstage, acting onscreen, fundraising, or giving public speeches.  He truly went from strength to strength, and because he was so devoted and committed to standing by his beliefs and principles, his career was temporarily halted and his reputation (in America at least) tarnished during the McCarthyist witch hunts of the late Forties and most of the Fifties.  People who had not long ago been huge fans and supporters of his suddenly turned on him because of his Leftist beliefs and how he refused to back down from what he stood for.  However, not everyone let the terrifying political climate of the time deter them from continuing to support him and attend his concerts and lectures, and he was able to find great continued success in Europe.  And even while he was being persecuted in his country, he made it clear that he did not intend to permanently settle in Europe, because he'd been born in America and was committed to working to reform and change it.  After the climate of fear and persecution lifted, he was able to continue his career as a singer and speaker in America.

Watching this documentary really made Robeson one of my new heroes.  Not only was he a great actor and a fantastic singer, he was also a tireless champion of civil rights and civil liberties, an activist against the Vietnam War, all other wars, and the bomb, a proponent of peace, and a great believer that we are all one, that people of all races and nationalities are brothers and sisters.  When many others were scared into hiding their Leftist beliefs, Robeson stayed strong and spoke out against the gross violations of civil liberties and the First Amendment during the McCarthyist witch hunts, stating loud and clear that it was against the law to persecute people for belonging to a certain political party and for trying to deny them their freedom of association and expression.  Scarily enough, we're heading back towards that same climate today.  He really practised what he preached, and wasn't afraid to speak out politically even when he was in the Soviet Union during the last years of Stalin's reign.  At a concert he gave, he said he had recently spoken with a man who was supposed to have officially disappeared (and who soon was killed, one of the victims of the so-called ""Doctors' Plot""), and to express his solidarity with the Jewish community, he sang ""Zog Nit Keyn Mol,"" the song sung by the ghetto fighters and partisans during the Shoah.  He really went above and beyond the call of duty in reaching out to all groups of oppressed people and feeling that regardless of differing races, religions, and nationalities, all oppressed peoples' struggles for freedom, equality, and civil rights were one and the same and that all people, whomever they might be, were indeed one big family.  Anyone can do the easy thing, but it takes a person of morals, character, and conviction to do the right thing, even though it might be the harder thing to do and one might be persecuted on account of it.  Staying true to himself meant more to him than denying his beliefs for the sake of an easier life.",1143763200,8,3939,4.740849194729136
190098,5,1572525525,"The content of this film has already been discussed, but fans will be pleased that most of the major issues dealing with Robeson, his career, and the controversy are all handled well in the allotted time. It also does not shy from some of the less flattering aspects of his career (such as his actual knowledge of Stalin's crimes, but his refusal to openly speak on this because he felt his bigger enemies were at home), but this is handled well and you come away with a good idea of what the man was about in his outspokenness on issues of oppressed people. Only monor complaint is the lack of special features on this DVD, but overall, it's worth the money.",1073347200,9,659,4.454545454545454
190099,4,1572525525,"This ""American Masters"" volume directed by St. Clair Bourne is an excellent centennial introduction to the life and times of Paul Robeson, one of the greatest Americans of the twentieth century.  The video's content has already been discussed by other reviewers and I have nothing to add on that score, other than to recommend three other fine books that people interested in finding out more might enjoy.
First is Martin Bauml Duberman's biography of Robeson, published in 1989.  This is the best single source.
Second is Philip Foner's excellent ""Paul Robeson Speaks"" which contains a collection of Robeson's writings and speeches, as well as an excellent chronology.  Particularly noteworthy is the transcript of Robeson's testimony before the House Unamerican Activities Committtee.
Third is Robeson's own book ""Here I Stand,"" a small but very valuable volume with enduring insights about America and the world.
O.K., there's also a fourth.  Paul Robeson Jr. has written an excellent new book about his father that is worth checking out.
You should be able to find these books (Foner's book may be out of print) on Amazon.",1070928000,20,1126,5.170329670329671

190101,5,1572525525,"This documentary is probably one of the best biopics I've seen in a long time--it's incredibly moving, it told a compelling story I wanted to keep listening to, and it devoted enough time and attention to its subject so that by the end you really felt you knew something about the man.
The reviewer on this page did an excellent job of summarizing the content of the documentary, though I disagree with her about the Robeson films shown.  That section of the movie dragged for me.  It's true that in role after role, Robeson was forced to play characters unworthy of him, allowed only the narrow, stereotyped range that moviegoers expected to see African-Americans portray, and undermined by directors and editors even when he attempts to give his work a deeper significance and a more challenging political message.  But the filmmakers seemed determined to show extended footage of each and every one of these movies, and it's painful to watch such a talented man being objectified in film after film.  I finally had to fast-forward.
In the ample footage of Robeson performing on his own, on the other hand, whether singing, speaking to crowds, or describing his life in television appearances, Robeson isn't forced to compromise with someone else's vision.  Here, he can say what he really thinks.  I was astonished at how unrelentingly outspoken Robeson was at such an early date--at least from the Second World War if not earlier.  In fact, when Robeson returns from an extended trip abroad in the early 1960s, he's greeted at the airport by a gaggle of interviewers, one of whom wants to know whether he'll be particating in the Civil Rights Movement.  Given everything we've seen thus far, it's an astonishing question and I was torn between outrage and laughter, but Robeson just gives the guy a mildly condescending stare and says, ""I consider myself to have been doing so my entire life.""  Likewise, a segment that shows how, over the years, Robeson transformed the song 'Ol' Man River' from a testament to racism to an ode to struggle and endurance is powerful.  I was also entranced by Robeson's television appearances.  In these, you can see something that doesn't come through in his singing speaking, or acting: that he was a natural storyteller, with a gift for timing and humor, and an actual physical involvement in each anecdote that seems to reflect his youthful training as an athlete.
All in all, I found this movie one of the most informative I've seen, one that educated without sacrificing its ability to entertain and entrance.  Much of the credit must go to Robeson himself, committed both to teaching America about the truth of its behavior toward its most disadvantaged citizens, and to the extraordinary quality of his artistic work, which has a beauty and power that remains to this day.",1061683200,33,2817,4.894957983193278
190102,5,1572525525,"I'll never understand why more people do not know who Paul Robeson was.  His steadfast adherence to the principles that make the promise of America so great made him one of the great unsung american heroes of the 20th century.  This DVD has interviews, pictures, film clips, and audio excerpts that bring the memory of this great man alive.  It's a must for anyone who understands or wants to understand the principles behind equality of justice and opportunity, and how one person really can make a difference in the pursuit of these lofty goals.",1060992000,7,547,4.797872340425532
190103,5,1572525525,"Actor, singer, athlete, lawyer and activist are just a few of the titles  bestowed on one of the greatest artistic geniuses of the 20th century.  Regaled by many and reviled by some Paul Robeson, the son of a slave,  stands out as an artist who intergrated his art as a form of activism  against the injustices perpetrated on those who are powereless.
  Here  I Stand is a cinematic chronicle of Paul Robeson's life as seen through the  eyes of himself, his colleagues, children, film critics and historians. The  chronicle of his life begins in New Jersey where is is raised by his father  a minister in the Presbyterian Church and later the African Methodist  Episcopal Zion church. From him, young Paul is taught to be fearless and  strive for excellence in whatever he does. Those values laid the foundation  of what he was to become. When he leaves New Jersey and goes to New York  for law school, Paul finds himself hitting the glass ceiling of a white law  firm and eventually is encouraged by his wife to seek an acting career.
  It is in singing and acting that Paul finds his true calling. One of the  great strengths of this video is its analysis of his acting career on stage  and in the movies. Paul failed in the movies not because of lack of talent  but because of the refusal of the industry to give him roles that weren't  stereotypical of Black people. His singing increases his popularity abroad  and soon he becomes politicized to the problems of the disinfranchised. It  is from this experience that the activist Paul Robeson emerges.
  All  through the film we see his growth as an activist and his firm refusal to  back down. Even more thrilling is his defiance against government authority  determined to keep him in his place but like old man river, he keeps  rolling along. He keeps going inspite of his passport taken away, the  constant hounding by the FBI, his concert career broken for close to ten  years and the deterioration of his health. Through it all, he maintains his  dignity and refuses to bow. He is an inspiration as to what Black men and  women should be. There are critical assessments of him concerning his  marriage and refusal to denounce Stalin but even those merely tell us he  was a man of his times flawed like any other. Yet he remains for us a giant  of his time.",969148800,42,2316,4.5634146341463415

7797895,4,1572525525,Very few of the younger generation knew who Paul Robeson was. What he was was a great humanitarian who was prosecuted for his political beliefs.

7797896,5,1572525525,"I support the reviews by the prior reviewers that this is a beautifully done documentary about a towering figure in entertainment and politics.  The images are clear, the sound is fine.  There are extended excerpts of his singing.  There is a considerable amount of archival video material.  His fight for justice and what was done to him by the United States Government has relevance today.",1433548800,,391,4.969230769230769
7797897,4,1572525525,"Robeson was an amazing renaissance man who left his indelible mark on not only on American (and world) film, theater and music (his singing voice is one of the most powerful and resonant I have ever heard), but also on U.S. politics and the African-American struggle in the middle of the 20th century. (Not to mention he was also a lawyer and world class athlete!)

The film doesn't shy away from Robeson's personal dark sides, and career miss-steps (for example, choices of film roles that surprisingly sometimes fed into black stereotypes) -- but in the end tells the story of a true tragic hero. A great artist who tried to lift his race onto his shoulders, and ended up blacklisted and hardly able to work in his own country, while being blocked from traveling abroad.

After scaling the heights as no other American artist of color did in the 1930s, Robeson's career was doomed in the post WWII communist paranoia of the 40s and 50s when he expressed admiration for the way the Soviet Union treated him as a visiting black man, and advocated rapprochement nuclear disarmament and world peace instead of confrontation with the Soviets. One can argue whether he was correct about the Russians, but his miss-trust of the U.S. certainly can be understood in the light of rampant Jim Crow racism oppressing his people, and the way Robeson himself was turned on when he dared speak out. His passport stripped, the government wouldn't even let this international star leave to earn a living elsewhere even as it stopped him from working at home.

The only thing lacking for me was a some of the emotion behind this great and sad life. By the end I found myself choked up (it would be almost impossible not to be moved by some of what Robeson went through, and his own growth through it all) but the film can feel a bit academic at moments. However, that's a small flaw measured against its many accomplishments.

This would be a good film for young people, who likely sadly know little if anything about Robeson -- one of the most important and influential U.S, artists of the 20th century.",1430006400,,2088,4.6811989100817435

7797899,5,1572525525,"The most incredible person in history - IGNORED. Robeson spoke over 12 languages fluently and was conversant in at least 20. Historians leave that out. He also got into a shouting match with President Truman in the White House for not passing the anti-lynching law and using his executive powers.

Paul Robeson is my favorite history biography to study. I have read every book on him I could find, and have all the documentaries.

There are SOOOO many interesting stories about him, I could share. He was close friends with everyone from the King of Sweden, to Bumpy Johnson to the Politburo of the Kremlin. His son, Paul Jr. went to school in Russia with Stalin's kid. He was also the first black person in the world allowed to play Othello.

He also played PRO FOOTBALL while attending Columbia University Law School. He was the 2nd pro black football player, after Fritz Pollard - Not to mention, at Rutgers he lettered 14 times in 4 Varsity sports.",1413244800,2,952,4.688622754491018
