8231053,4,B000Y7WGS8,"Our favorite storyline takes an unusual twist as Urd's mother Hild, the ruler of demonkind is called in to undo Mara's mess. Unfortunately, she decides to hang around and give Mara some motivation, ultimately creating a situation where Belldandy's love for Keiichi works against her. This gets Bell in trouble, and suspended. Will Keiichi have to be the one who pulls off the miracles now?
This particular installment of the series gets a bit strange at times, but the essentials are still there. It's still a wonderful story, and the characters still have that irresistible magic. The story is taking quite a turn, but it's still a worthwhile ride.",1223164800,2,649,4.963302752293578

8231056,4,B000Y7WGS8,"The four episodes on this DVD are a mixed bag for me.  Two super episodes followed by two which are, to me in my humble personal opinion, just filler.  The DVD starts off with the excellent conclusion to the story arc where urd is split between her good and evil halves.  The scene where they sing her back into shape makes me feel moved and my skin tingle every time I see it.  The next episode is basically one of my favorite AMG episodes.  Is Mara really all that evil?  To me, she's a civil servant intent on doing her job.  Notice how she freaks out when Hild is about to boil her henchmen.  A trully evil deamon would have just said ""boil them then"" because she really can just get more henchmen.  You notice lots of little things like that through the whole show.  Yes, Mara is a demon and she likes it, she takes great pride in her work, but she definatley has her limits.

Now we get to the two ""filler"" episodes that really bring the DVD down for me.  I'm sure that there are folks reading this that those two episodes are your all time favorite episodes.  That's cool, but they just don't flip my switch.  First is the wierd Ninja episode which apparently has great meaning in AMG lore, at least how its portrayed in the Manga I guess.  The message is that Belldandy will take any measure to protect Keichi, even defying death itself.  Too bad they had to portray this in such a cheesy episode.  I still like it though because the cheese has to do with Mara and a cheesy Mara basing her strategies off of movies she's seen is never a bad thing.

But I'm sorry, the last is just cringeworthy.  Keichi and Belldandy get lost in an endless void.  It just strikes of one of those episodes where the producers have run out of money and time and just have thrown something slapdash together to get the required number of episodes they need.  One of my all time favorite programs, ""Doctor Who"", did the same thing all the time!  It seems silly though, in an anime where they can portray anything, they make the main characters wander around an endless white void with a simple wood floor.  However, It seems I miss the message of the episode because I'm a guy.  My girlfriend tells me that this was a very touching episode because Keichi and Belldandy got to spend so much time together (even dancing together) before they got rescued.  I guess I just have no soul.  :-)  If you have a soul, give this DVD five stars.

All in all though, too much Belldandy is never enough and you MUST own this DVD if you like the show.  :-D",1203638400,,2529,4.321276595744681
8231057,5,B000Y7WGS8,"This disk starts off with the aftermath of Marla's use of the 'heretical pot'.....Urd seems to be of two minds about everything and demon part of her is slowly slipping away.  While Bell, Kei, Skuld and Marla is trying to come up with ways to help her, she comes to the decision that she wants to remain as she is.  The problem is only two beings can help her, The Almighty One and the Chair of Demonkind.  While the Almighty One could help her, he might change her into a full goddess, so the decision is made to call the Lord of Demons, Hild (who is much more sultry the Urd is, but then she is her mother after all).  Hild comes in a flash of lightning (you know with all the explosions and things that happen around that temple, you think the neighbors would have complained by now) and offers her help in exchange for a wish.  The next episode starts with Marla at her part time job at the local convenience store (Bell got her the job)as she makes end meet while trying to beat the goddesses (she is doing so well she is up for promotion to shift manager).  When she returns home she tries to come up with a plan to attack the temple when an incarnation of Hild appears (one at 1/1000 of her true strength, which is scary as is) and offers her help.  Marla tries all sorts of things to attack, which of course fails.  The reason is that Hild was testing Belldandy's powers and heart.  The third episode has Marla cloning little ninja masters off of her favorite tv show to spy on and create havoc for Belldandy and Keii.  The third master that appears seems to have the upper hand, until Bell casts a very powerful banishment spell which not only saves them, but also gets her licence suspended.  The last episode has Bell working to become a normal person, hoever all their friends have a slight storage problem so they drop everything off at the temple.  Skuld comes up with a great device that expands the rooms size in the area that it is in, but llike most devices this one goes 'slightly' haywire and Keiichi and Bell are trapped in a near infinite space.

This disk is as good as the rest.  The actors are really getting into the stories and the dubbing is spot on.  Let's hope when season 3 comes around they are all still there.  See you next disk.........",1200355200,,2271,4.333333333333333
