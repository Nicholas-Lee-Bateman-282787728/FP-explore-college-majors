3119502,5,B0013TT58K,"Golf Made Simple is an excellent school program and I have been several times in the last few years.  Consequently I was not at all surprised with the easy, concise drills and concepts in the DVD.  I would highly recommend it and am excited to play next season after keeping my swing and game fresh over the winter.",1204243200,10,315,4.413793103448276
3119503,5,B0013TT58K,"These drills live up to the name of the school...Golf Made Simple. These drills help with turning throught he ball, weight shift, and squaring the clubface without thinking about it. The drills make it automatic when out on the course. The exercises help with flexibility and increase distance. If you have been to one of the schools (which I recommend) the DVD is a great review and reminder of the concepts learned over the 3 day school. It is done in a fun easy to understand manner. Spending just 10-15 minutes per day for a couple weeks in the comfort of your own home will do wonders for your ball striking. Better than beating balls on the range for an hour.",1204156800,7,665,4.5041322314049586
3119504,5,B0013TT58K,"This is a great product.  For those of us who have benefited from attending the Golf Made Simple Golf Schools (I attended twice), this is a great way to stay fresh during the dark cold days of no golf in many parts of the country, and practice indoors the drills which have made so many of us devotees of the GMS system.  The DVD provides drills which can be done in 20-30 minutes a day indoors to stay fresh and ready for the spring.

In addition, there are excellent ""golf fitness"" exercises easy to do at home and in the gym.

I give the GMS program and this DVD the highest recommendation.",1204070400,10,593,4.267857142857143

8252978,1,B0013TT58K,"This video is a joke, has noting to do with his teaching.  I have been to the clinic (which was great).  Very simple exercise video.

I had hoped this would compliment the clinic, no such luck",1497830400,,192,4.277777777777778
8252979,5,B0013TT58K,Excellent simple advice.  Very helpful.,1436572800,,39,6.8
8252980,4,B0013TT58K,"Having attended GMS twice this was a great refresher video.  Reinforced some of the concepts learned and was an excellent reminder of the key drills like parallel hands, symmetry and the belly swing.  Living in the Canada this will be good to develop muscle memory for the spring season.  Looking forward to continuing the drills and the exercises...Marc may want to take some acting lessons, but that is not what this is about...simplicity is the key.",1320451200,,452,4.921052631578948
8252981,1,B0013TT58K,"This is a big waste of money for me. The instructor does not look like a pro or fluent in what he is teaching, rather like a big talk person. This depressed me very much. There is no helpful tips or techniques that i can adapt.",1244851200,,227,3.9565217391304346
8252982,5,B0013TT58K,"I just picked this up to use over the fall and winter and have not had it that long so could not fully see how it will go, though I am getting better at the drills which I am sure will help.  With these tips, drills and exercises I'm already looking forward to next spring.  Very clear and getting me to refocus on my game",1223683200,2,322,3.9384615384615387
8252983,5,B0013TT58K,The GMS video is clear and to the point. The Drills works well to help you develop feel for the golf swing. The exercises are really good for the golfer to begin a golf workout regime. I have done the drills and added the workout to my golf fitness routine and althought I have had a chance to play yet here in the north I am sure this video will help. I liked the video so much that I decided to attend one of the schools in march. Buy the video do the drills and the exercises and watch your golf game and life get better.,1204502400,7,524,3.952830188679245
8252984,5,B0013TT58K,"I watched this video, and it already improved my game quite a bit!!  It is sunny here, but the putting drill alone is worth the price of the DVD.  The video work is simple and direct, no flashy distractions, just clear instructions.  Using simple techniques, and systems I am sure this will help any golf nut that you know, and the price is quite nice!
A bonus is the features on how to use an exercise ball to create what Marc calls ""core strength"", which is very helpful for the non-athletic golfer.",1204243200,7,501,4.423913043478261
8252985,5,B0013TT58K,"I treat non surgical back pain for a living and have done so for 25 years. If you are a golfer with recurrent back pain and follow the exercise routine in this DVD you may have  less back pain after 4 to 6 weeks due to improved spinal ""core stability"".  If you do the drills you will also hit the ball more solid and straighter more frequently.  Following the DVD program over this past winter, I was recently able to escape the snow and play some golf in Maui.  My second round in 4 months - I shot my handicap (10) at Kapalua, a PGA tour course I had never played before.  Obviously, your milage will vary and simply ""owning"" the DVD will certainly not result in this kind of  improvement.  However, if you spend 1/2 hour 3 times per week  you will notice an improvement in your core and extremity strength. Forget the gym membership, buy a physio ball and this DVD.  This is probably the cheapest golf exercise/improvement DVD available  and yet may be the best one you can buy at any price.",1204243200,16,994,4.324324324324325
8252986,5,B0013TT58K,"Just bought your Video ""How to improve your golf game Indoors"".By far this is the best improvement drills and exercises DVD that I have bought. I started doing the drills and exercises right after the holidays ( had to get in all the good meals before I started )and I have already seen tremendous results. I had a bad habit of pulling, topping and not getting any distance or accuracy on my hits. After doing your drills and exercises for only two and half weeks,I'm hitting all my shots straighter, and further. My accuracy has improved 100%.Thank you for putting out an exercise program that works and drills that show immediate results. I hope to get to one of your schools some time this year. Again thank you for putting out this outstanding DVD.I'm excited about my progress and looking forward to a reduced handicap and lower scores.
put this on amazon!",1204243200,6,861,4.671052631578948
