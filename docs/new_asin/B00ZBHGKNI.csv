I do like it but if given the choice of watching this or Georgy Girl I will always go with Lynn Redgrave.
A Taste Of Honey for me is about the rebellious struggle of a young woman to have a life of her own.
Her Mother seems indifferent and regards her daughter as something of an annoyance, especially when her new lover wants her out of the way.
The daughter, Jo, gets a job and finds a place of her own after Mum abandons her.
She meets a young black man and they casually fall in love.
After he ships out to sea she learns she is pregnant, unfortunately.
And I say that because she is so young and impoverished.
I'm impressed Jo decides to keep the baby, despite the difficulties of her situation.
She soon meets a young gay man who is a customer of the store she works in and they quickly become friends and flatmates.
They seem almost close for a time but Jo's estranged mother comes back to help her with the coming baby as a pretense.
Her new relationship has gone sour after voicing concern for her daughter, so she is capable of admirable maternal instinct after all.
Jo's gay flatmate is now out of place and ultimately decides to step aside for the new mother-daughter relationship.
This is their time, he has to move on.

This is an interesting story about realistic people but it just seems like a stylish soap opera set in 1961 England to me.
I think the gay character is a cliche stereotype but then again there weren't many obvious gays in early 60's cinema.
Production design for this film is excellent, wonderful cinematography.
I think I like it most for the visuals.

If you are a serious fan of this film go with the Criterion Bluray release, it's probably the best available.",1507420800,,2017,4.46070460704607
