8584188,5,B000EPMATA,"Great for local food enthusiasts, foodies, or anyone just looking for a quality, relaxing tv program that can be viewed in front of children. It's educational, well put together and visually stimulating. Many of the recipes presented at the end of each segment are inspiring and instructive. I would recommend this to anyone interested in a closer relationship to real food, or anyone who enjoys food and it's story.",1363305600,,416,5.043478260869565
