4669439,3,B005EXA8Q4,"Having spent a number of visits to Holland, MI in the past and liking all the main stars, I was looking forward to this one.  The best part of this movie is seeing early Kathryn Grayson sing.  She does a number of songs exhibiting her great voice.  The story idea is good, but the problem lies more with the way it is carried out.  Sakall, normally a favorite of mine is his usual quirky self but spends more time ignoring his daughters' issues and less time selling Van Heflin on the Dutch village.  Unlike a Brigadoon with Gene Kelly or Luck of the Irish with Tyrone Power, the travelling gentlemen does not buy into the local charm.  This makes Van Heflin's character more of a cad than a romantic lead.  All the sisters are lovely, including Marsha Hunt as the vain oldest sister, a young Frances Rafferty of later TV fame, and even Grayson's own real life sister in one of her rare roles.  The happy ending is tagged on that you expect but maybe a slightly different script would have done more with the premise.",1356566400,8,1017,4.43010752688172
4669440,5,B005EXA8Q4,"There's a look on your face, as if you've got a yen for some background material on SEVEN SWEETHEARTS. So, here, get some. You can pretty much thank Deanna Durbin for Kathryn Grayson's big break. MGM had allowed Durbin's contract to elapse and she went on to sign with Universal and to a string of huge box office successes. MGM rued the day and was left scrambling to find someone to fill in that Durbin-sized hole. An MGM talent scout saw Kathryn Grayson performing at a music festival. While SEVEN SWEETHEARTS, which came out in 1942, is Grayson's fourth film, it's the one that really got heads turning. It happens to be my second favorite film featuring Kathryn Grayson, after KISS ME KATE.

There's a timeless feel to this delightful musical comedy, and an almost, almost fairy tale vibe. Worldly New York newspaper reporter Henry Taggart (Van Heflin) arrives in the picturesque Dutch hamlet of Little Delft, Michigan to do a piece on the town's annual tulip festival, except he ends up deeply smitten with the youngest of the local innkeeper's seven beautiful sisters. There's a hitch, naturally. The fussy father, Papa Van Maaster (S.Z. Sakall), abides by a long-held family tradition: The oldest daughter must be married first. But while just about all the younger sisters are secretly engaged, the oldest sister, the theatrical Regina (Marsha Hunt), doesn't have a beau in her life. When Regina quotes Shakespeare, Taggart ventures a remark: ""Oh, you're an actress!"" Regina's response: ""I am much more than that. I'm a personality."" We sort of get a hint why she doesn't have a boyfriend. Anyway, Taggart's interest quickly shifts to Billie Van Maaster (Grayson) after an earnest conversation by the lift. Billie comes across as refreshing and sensible and dutiful, and she does this cute thing where she tugs her ear whenever she starts to get mad. And, oh lord, can she sing.

One of the neater conceits of this film is that Papa Van Maaster had quirkily given his daughters boy names before they were born because he had been hoping for boys. This allows us to witness Heflin's fun reaction as he checks into the inn and is greeted, one by one, by the sisters, who all look like pin-up models. This, by the way, includes Grayson's real-life sister, Frances Raeburn, who plays Cornelius.

Van Heflin is just fine as the male lead, and he and that puffy-cheeked, lovely character actor of a man, S.Z. Sakall, provide good moments. And I'm more than obliged to ogle the actresses who play Billie's sisters. But, for this film, the sun rises and sets on Kathryn Grayson. Producer Joseph Pasternak, who had already molded Deanna Durbin into a big star in Universal, managed to get Kathryn Grayson cast in SEVEN SWEETHEARTS and, later, in THOUSANDS CHEER and ANCHORS AWEIGH. The camera adores the fresh-faced Kathryn Grayson, and you sort of shake your head in amazement whenever she soars high with that operatic soprano of hers. She does justice to all the songs she belts out, but, for me, ""You and a Waltz and I"" and ""Little Tingle Tangle Toes"" are the stand-out tracks.

SEVEN SWEETHEARTS offers up lots of laughs and a great energy and appealing classical music and some wooden shoes dancing. It's one of those films that, as they say, they don't make anymore, and you won't be doing yourself any favors by missing out. Maybe one thing I take away from this film - other than the splendidness of Kathryn Grayson - is that should I ever fall for a soprano singer and want to make sure my heart isn't being trifled with, I'll be sure to pay particular attention to her tremolo. This apparently is a dead giveaway.",1327190400,10,3624,4.77511961722488
4669441,5,B005EXA8Q4,"Seven Sweethearts is one of Kathryn Grayson's earliest films, it being only the second year she was in film.  Like most films of the era, Seven Sweethearts is in black-and-white.  But don't let that bother you: the music created by Grayson is glorious, the equal of any one of her more popular films of the late 40s (eg. Anchors Aweigh, The Kissing Bandit, Show Boat, The Toast of New Orleans).  Grayson is stunning and absolutely captivating as the devoted daughter of an inn-keeper who is willing to give up marriage to remain with her father (cast by the well-known character actor S. Z. Sakall, whose best-known role is probably Karl in the film Casablanca).

Anyone who loves Kathryn Grayson will want this film.  As for the rest of you (is there anyone out there who doesn't love Kathryn Grayson?), you don't know what you're missing.",1318204800,8,840,4.76551724137931

During several visits to the US in the 70's, 80's and 90's my partner and I got to visit and spend time with each of the seven sweethearts, except of course for Kathryn's real life sister Frances Raeburn, who had passed at a very early age.  All ladies were an absolute delight and both Kathryn and Marsha Hunt became very dear friends.  Although I have not been back since 1994 I am in regular contact with dear Marsha by telephone and correspondence - her birthday is coming up in October when she reaches the age of either 99 or 100.  My late partner and more recently myself have written many, many articles for several US film journals eg Classic Images and Films of the Golden Age.

8469188,4,B005EXA8Q4,"Seven Sweethearts would have gotten five stars from me if the producers hadn't saddled themselves with grumpy old Van Heflin playing the lead, a veteran reporter.  I guess he's young Van Heflin, certainly younger than I've seen him before, but his youth does not help him out in this role, if anything it makes him even more unlikeable, for if a boy so young can already be such a wiseass to everyone in the first half of the picture, is there any hope for America?  He is decidedly a cad who sneers at the little Dutch town built into a flat plain of Michigan landscape, and sneers at the crazy hotel he's booked into, and sneers at Cuddles who runs the place, and the seven sisters all with boys' names.  We see everything through Van Heflin's eyes, and there are many improbabilities to swallow, and yet under the master hand of the great Frank Borzage, all of this goes down smooth as silk--the romance, the music, the sexy Marsha Hunt as the oldest sister, directed to impersonate a great camp object like Mae West.  Borzage knows what to do in every frame of film, though the set designers don't make things easy for him.  I can just picture the commotion in the art department when Joe Pasternak sent down this script and they realized they were charged with making a miniature Holland with tultips and wooden shoes and milkmaid outfits and yodeling, and still manage to make it ""American"" as well.  Not a single inch of the old Arts and Crafts style hotel goes unmarked by Netherland hideousness, baroque to the extreme, and fresh tulips everywhere, inside, outside, on the balconies, on the breakfast table, and in case you don't notice, there are songs about them.  Little humpbacked bridges, ice skating, Dutch meals with unpronounceable consonants, and those horrid beanie caps placed flat onto Kathryn Grayson's long curly hair.  Grayson as ""Billie"" is directed to constantly snicker or sniffle in close  up after she delivers a comeback to Van Heflin, and the camera lingers on her itchy nose and fidgety fingers so many times that I realized, this wasn't some Tourettes blooper left in the movie by mistake, but it is supposed to be an adorable twitch and we see Van Heflin melting for her a little harder every time this sniffle comes into play.

The plot is rather like Kiss Me Kate, isn't it--I wonder if when Grayson landed the role in Kiss Me Kate is she thought to herself, I played this part years ago, except in Kate she is playing the Marsha Hunt part, the oldest, crabby, disagreeable, vain sister who must be married off before her younger sister can get married.  It's the oldest story in the world, so the writers must have said, ""Let's have six of these suffering sisters, and let's make SZ Sakall the father!""  Usually I like Sakall but here, he is a monster, and the back story that's supposed to help his understand him (that Marsha Hunt is supposed to be the spitting image of her late mother, and that's why Cuddles can't bear to see her go or deny her anything, only makes him seem even more sexually perverse than he usually is.  My God, he is such a strange actor!  Bunuel must have longed to cast him in a movie, but MGM and then Warners had him wrapped up for decades, always officious, always self-centered, always the malaprop, and usually lusting secretly after Doris Day or Jane Wyman or some other comically sexy babe.

There is basically nothing wrong with Seven Sweethearts, and I loved every minute of it, perhaps for its overstuffed dcor and its strange political allegory (they are supposed to be in a simulacrum of Holland, at a moment when Holland had been swallowed up by Nazi invasion, and yet MGM did not yet allow the screenwriters to allude to the Nazi party directly).  If only Van Heflin had even a soupcon of charm!  For really, there hasn't been a picture to match it in seventy years.",1433289600,,3845,4.622613803230544
