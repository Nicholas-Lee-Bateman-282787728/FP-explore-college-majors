Wish the publishers would xfer to DVD - even if the content didn't get updated  a DVD version would make the video more user friendly.",1225497600,,298,4.5
8188963,4,B000053ZXT,"This video is 10 years old and it's hard to believe no one has reviewed it 'til now. The 2-tape series is hosted by Eddie Kramer (rock producer most noted for his production for Jimi Hendrix), who, along with other studio professionals take you through the recording process in a project studio, from sound acoustics, to microphone choices & proper miking techniques, the various pieces of studio gear and their functions, basic tracking, and mixdown, all demonstrated with a rock band in the studio recording a track. There's a lot of good information to gather from these videos as taught by a long-time veteran of the business. However, with all the info that's now widely available via the net on this subject, the value of this collection is somewhat questionable. But if you can find a used copy cheap and need a reference video that does a great job of the basics, go for it.  4 stars for content, 3 for value, ten years after it's production.",1097625600,,950,4.688622754491018
