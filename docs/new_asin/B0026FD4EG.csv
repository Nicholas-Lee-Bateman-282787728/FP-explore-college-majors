I have been contemplating whether or not to hike some of the trails that were presented in this video, not only am I going to go on as many of them that I can but the DVD helped me see the beauty in all of these places! Thank you so much for the inspiration.",1268697600,,359,3.9722222222222223
8352524,1,B0026FD4EG,"The pictures are beautiful, but there is no dialogue or written comments.  It is just pictures and a short (3 or 4 word) description.  While the photography is great -- from one of my favorite places on earth -- I wish there had been some dialogue giving interesting facts and information about the sites.  With only pictures, I found it over prices.",1265414400,,350,4.612903225806452
