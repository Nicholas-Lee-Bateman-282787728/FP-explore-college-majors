8387597,3,B0032MYY50,"I was very excited to see this video. I am training for some triathlons and wanted to improve my swim time. A coach recommended this video, so I'm sure it has some good content. However, I can barely get myself to sit through the lecture portion (45min!). There is a ton of static noise during the lecture... I guess they didn't use a good mic. It's very annoying to try to sit through. I got through 15 min and had to shut it off! I'm hoping the technique portions are not as poor quality. I feel like, for $30, they should have made a better quality video. :0( It also makes you question the technique a little... the poor quality of the video makes you feel like you are listening to a cut-rate scam. lol",1359590400,,707,4.2444444444444445

8387599,5,B0032MYY50,"I purchased PowerStroke by One Step Beyond to help me in my swim training for triathlons.  The video identifies the different types of strokes, which are most effective, and finally how to make corrections to your stroke.  I am an average swimmer and have problems with my pull.  After watching the video, which analyzes stroke frame by frame, I improved my overall swim workouts by minutes.  Marty Gaal covers everyone from beginners to experts.  I strongly recommend this video for anyone who is into triathlons or any swimmming distance, this will lead to efficiency and speed in the water.",1272499200,3,593,4.94949494949495
