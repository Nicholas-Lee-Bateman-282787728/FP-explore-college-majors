Alfred Hitchcock could scare an audience but they knew it would turn out alright. This is the third repackaging of these movies (The Legend Begins, A Legacy of Suspense); the six discs imply higher quality. All are in monochrome. The movies made before 1929 are silent, the newer ones have higher quality. The two 25 minute movies are from his 1950's TV show Alfred Hitchcock Presents. Sabotage came from the novel The Secret Agent by Joseph Conrad. Europe then was threatened by terrorist bombs, much like today. The movie The Secret Agent is taken from the novel Ashenden by Somerset Maugham. The 39 Steps came from a famous novel by John Buchan (who had an interesting career). It pointed out that Britain was no longer isolated from the Continent. The plot was used a number of times (innocent man pursued by both the police and the criminals). The Man Who Knew Too Much was reproduced in 1956. The last version (not by Hitchcock) was called Foul Play. The Lodger came from a novel by Marie Belloc-Lowndes. Here are the titles for each DVD.
