2869961,5,B000RO6JZE,I like that Shatner has reinvented himself again and he is 77 years old!! But why does the BL team wait so long to put out its seasons on DVD ... Someone is not watching trends over there and should be fired. release the DVD's after the season ends! Great show great cast to bad it always slams you over the head with the left wing message ... a little smoother would be better. Buy it when it comes out...September ..so silly.,1184112000,14,427,4.219512195121951

2870052,5,B000RO6JZE,"I Loved this series when it was on. I actually liked any legal series by David Kelly. He did Ally McBeal, Boston Legal, The practice, and several others. He puts weirdness and humor into his shows. He also adds a lot of humanity. I love to hear the closing arguments during these tv shows. They are so passionate and many times they almost make you want to tear up. The show definitely shows you the power of words. But at the same time, so enjoyable to watch. This is James Spader before The Blacklist. It shows he knows how to act.because these two characters are totally different.",1485820800,,584,4.4672897196261685

Season 4 seemed to lose that magic and just felt off in several key ways. 5, a half season makes up for it, though. A little too late, though. But at least the first three seasons are golden, at least!",1474243200,,428,4.487179487179487

The writing is top-flight. If you haven't seen it yet, shame on you. Tragically, the show is not available on streaming services (at least not at this time), so the DVDs are the only way to go. I bought Season Three in the U.S. because I live in Japan, and whoever owns the license for it here, criminally I would say, only provides the first two seasons with Japanese subtitles. My Japanese wife adores this show as much as I do, which says a lotcomedy does not usually translate well.",1448755200,,661,4.471074380165289

The big surprise was the "" Like new"" listing with the discs having obvious scratches and scuffs and the box looks like someone sat on it. So far they have been playable. If not I will have them resurfaced at my local disc exchange. But like new is far from it. More like "" play with caution"".

Both Season Two and Season Three arrived in damaged packaging with discs loose and scuffed. I am extremely displeased, as these are gifts that I fortunately opened to inspect.

Great fun with all the cast and predicaments they get themselves into. Actually, no one really seems to care of the trouble they get in. Life just kind of slides off their shoulders as they smile for the cameras and put up with the difficulties knowing they will win the day.

Occasionally the series has unintentional humor, such as when they have Alan Shore (James Spader) or Candice Bergen (Shirley Schmidt) lecture the audience on Guantanamo Bay, domestic wiretapping, and enemy combatants not permitted trials in civilian court. Surprise, liberals! President Obama continued every Bush policy he campaigned against, it was just to get the votes of the uninformed (which he did and they are). Watching Alan Shore rail against the injustice of a Bush world is very humorous when watched in 2011, and we see every hyper-partisan complaint continues onwards with Obama running things. As Hands would say, 'eep!'

You need to fill in the blanks on why Clarence is now Shore's secretary and not Claire's, and more.  Other than missing shows, it is wonderful!",1263081600,,443,4.1647058823529415

Also, Bowen's expanded role let her actress skills shine, and she was a joy to watch.  Also, Jerry (""Hands"") comes back to the show in an expanded role, and he is a wonderful character.  Alan and Denny never stop getting more and more interesting, and you will love their exchanges.  This is definitely a season worth watching.

All of this said, I expected the show to be a lot of fun, as I have enjoyed other David E Kelley productions such as Ally McBeal and The Practice.  And Boston Legal does not disappoint.  The writing reminds me a great deal of the legal drama and character-driven antics found in Ally.  Shatner's would-be romance with a petit attorney could go toe-to-toe with the escapades of McBeal's fetish-obsessed Richard Fish('bygones').

Certainly, if you enjoy legal shows or are an attorney, you will like Boston Legal - but those of you who aren't particularly drawn to such shows will also love this show.

Boston Legal showcases typically 2 cases, as well as some inter-office drama, but the heart of this series is more about the friendship between William Shatner and James Spader.  I never knew what great actors these two men were!  James Spader had always been a ""pretty boy"" so that you couldn't really see past his looks, but he won an Emmy for this show. Likewise, Shatner absolutely SHINES in this drama.

One of the unique shows of Season 3 is Episode 18 where there are ""flashbacks"" of Shatner as a young man.  To show this, they use a movie that he starred in with Ralph Bellamy almost 50 years ago. It was astounding!

I am not a person who gets amused by many shows. But Boston Legal is so laugh out loud funny at times. What is even more unique is that it also tackles so many social issues of our times.

I am certainly taken with the talent of James Spader, who in my estimation is most talented, and I look forward to his closing arguments each week.

2870441,4,B000RO6JZE,"The Seattle Intelligencer called this show ""poetically demented"", and it's easy to see why! Each episode is an exciting collection of deliciously absurd adventures and eloquent closing speeches that would have made Daniel Webster proud. The outrageous situations that the staff of Crane Schmidt & Poole get into sometimes make you wonder how they have any time to do their work. You sometimes get the impression that, in the quest for a few laughs, some stories get a bit over the top by being outrageous simply for its own sake. You have to wonder whether, as Denny Crane, you're seeing the real William Shatner or just a character he's playing, and his outrageous egomania can be quite amusing, but after a while you start to wonder what it would be like if he actually did, just once, have a tiny speck of humility! I wonder if the producers might consider trying that idea just once, as a change of pace?
Denny and Alan's neverending parade of affairs with one woman after another may be a sort of male fantasy come to life (although the women do occasionally have a few flings also to make things fair), and indeed it sometimes seems to me that this show might be us guys' revenge on women for watching shows like ""Grey's Anatomy"" where they swoon over hunky types like that - urp - ""Dr. McDreamy"" character!
 Sorry ladies, I'm just jealous because I know I'll never look like him!  :-)

EPILOGUE:
Ladies and gentlemen, as of this writing, it appears that this show, which once held great promise by going where no prime time program of its type had gone before, has finally been cancelled; I believe the reason is that it just got WAY too ridiculous for its own good!!!

2870442,5,B000RO6JZE,"Boston Legal is my dream come true - Comedy / Crime /Legal Courtroom Drama which is a perfect combination of all genres and is as funny as it is clever and gripping. The idea of ""Boston Legal"" had came to its creator, David E. Kelley during the last season of once very popular but sadly quietly dying legal drama ""Practice"". I was a big fan of the show and I stayed with it to the end. Bringing to ""Young, Berluti, & Frutt"" of ""Practice"" an ethically-challenged, arrogant, morally ambiguous but brilliant and somehow likable attorney Alan Shore (James Spader) was Kelley's great idea. The last season of Practice became one of best thanks to Spader who resurrected it by simply being there. When I heard that Spader would have a spin-off ""Boston Legal"", I could hardly wait for it and it has never disappointed me. Boston Legal is ""Crane, Poole, and Schmidt"", a famous and wealthy firm that specializes on civil cases. In the center of the show are Alan Shore and his older friend and mentor Denny Crane (William Shattner). To bring them together in one show and let them have a wonderful relationship that is based on their differences (comparing to Denny who is in love with the sound of his own name, Alan seems highly moral and stable model citizen) and is at the same time hilarious, sincere, and moving was a pure genius. Each episode would end with both Alan and Denny sitting on the balcony, smoking cigars, drinking scotch and having a friendly conversation and those are the best moments of the show.

Alan and Denny are the central characters in ""Boston Legal"" but every attorney in the ""Crane, Poole, and Schmidt"" is a unique individual. There is a former marine Brad, the veteran of Operation Desert Storm with the strong principles - the complete opposite to Alan. There is Clarence, a man with several personalities and Claire, the girl who loves him. Candice Bergen has joined the cast at Crane, Poole, and Schmidt, as Shirley Schmidt, sharp like a razor senior partner as brilliant, manipulative, and arrogant as both Denny and Alan are. There is also a dwarf Bethany ""who comes and goes"" with whom Denny has an on- and off- relationship. Jerry ""Hands"" Espenson with his Asperger syndrome has re-joined the firm and his return will certainly add to the practice (and the show) success. You may like them or not but they all have one thing in common - they are fantastic attorneys, always on the top of their game. All actors, the series regulars and the guests constantly give first-class performances, Writing is superb in every episode and ""Boston Legal"" has become one of if not the best comedy-drama on TV today.

In the conclusion, I'd like to share one of my favorite scenes in the show. Denny and Allan are on the balcony talking about Shirley. Denny and Shirley used to have a passionate affair way back and she is still the love of his life. Alan's lust for Shirley is so overwhelming that he showed up in the office party dressed up like her (and he managed to look better than she did) explaining that everyone had to dress up like a person he/she admires the most.

Denny (thoughtfully, remembering something very special to him) -""Shirley...One night while making love, she recited Proust.""

Alan: ""Did you understand it?""

Denny: ""Not a single word. I thought she was possessed",1209513600,6,3309,4.70811744386874

Season three is filled with the interesting characters that we are used to in a David E. Kelly show and it is also jammed packed with smart and searing wit with some wisdom as well.  I so enjoy Alan Shore's soap boxing and his balcony scenes with Shatner, which has become one of the best parts of the show.  With the writers strike of 2008 I am unsure what the 4 season will look like but I will buy it anyway.  I guess I don't hate this television.",1203033600,,737,4.154929577464789

Although I enjoy the humor throughout each episode, I do look forward to the messages given to us by our beloved character Allan Shore during his defense cases in the courtroom setting.

It is a fabulous example of a place where everyone there has some degree of differentness that probably wouldn't be acceptable in the ""regular world."" It is a small world of ""misfits"" who are straight with each other - confront each other - demonstrate their talents to the best of their ability - deal with current world issues in a thought-provoking way - entertain with great humor - have classy offices and clothing - skirt on the edge at times about getting fixated on a life-size doll as a substitute lover...and more.  It has everything including the sadness that is felt by one who gets older and isn't what he or she once was and does everything possible to cover that up and still be a contributing member of the work world. It has the most diversity of any program I've ever seen.",1202515200,,944,4.585798816568047

2870448,5,B000RO6JZE,"Boston Legal is without doubt the best television writing I have ever seen.  It is the story of every day shenanigans in a law firm in Boston and is absolutely hilarious.

 It makes you laugh, it makes you think, it is enlightening on a wide variety of issues and backs them all up with hard facts.  All the characters, even the minor ones are well developed and highly entertaining.  Their strengths and weaknesses are dealt with incredible warmth and humour without becoming in any way melodramatic.  It is also surreal and quirky at the same time, and all of that in 40 short minutes!  Each episode is perfectly spaced and complete.  It has the best one-liners I have ever come across.  The closing arguments are clear, concise and so very eloquently delivered; you can discuss each one for days.  The acting is of a very high standard and brings that wonderful writing to life and does it total justice.

I was hooked after 2-3 episodes and ended up watching all of them.  Season 3 certainly doesn't disappoint, but I also highly recommend seasons 1 and 2.  It is now in its 4th season and I find it incredible that with each new episode they still manage to hold our interest as if it was the first.  It is like watching a never-ending comedy feature film, and you just don't want it to ever end!  You can watch it over and over again and still laugh out loud.

His ""closings"" are equal or better, to those given by seasoned attorneys. Kudos to the writers and to Spader for giving us a sense of realism. Spader's ability to deliver believable legal rhetoric tainted with humor and sarcasm is both entertaining and effective.

This all star cast is a pleasure to watch.  Unfortunately, the roles for Michael J. Fox, Betty White and Jayne Brooke were temporary; they were excellent additions to a stellar cast.  My only constructive criticism is directed at the role of William Chatner.  He is a multi-faceted actor with an incredible ability to reach viewers.  Each time I see a glimpse Chatner's real talent, I am sorely disappointed when the character reverts to campy dialogue.  On occasion, Chatner's lines are entertaining, but a little goes a long way.

There are great stories that take place within the office itself including the strange 'hands off' policy Denny Crane places on Shirley Schmidt. This season is a real treat to be seen making the show bigger and better with every episode and great special apperiences, by Katey Segal, Bernidette Peters, Armin Shimmerman (Another Star Trek cast member) Just to name a few.

Always entertaining.  If you enjoy legal dramas, eat this one up.

David E Kelly's writing is still great but I feel he is trying to place to much comedy into situations and this has IMO dumbed down Boston Legal from witty intellegence to just plain pointlessness.

Main Characters are being subject to sillyness and as a BL fan I can say some boundries should never have been crossed, i.e. Allen's behaviour towards Denice.  Further more, the Allen and Denny banter is becoming tired, Shirley has become one-dimentional, while the likes of Paul, Brad and Geoffrey were made to become side characters as the predictable cleanout as season four approached. Naturally Denice slowed down as actor Julie Bowden entered motherhood.

Newbees Clarance, Claire and now regular Jerry, pick up some airtime but Claire pretty much dissapears from view untill the end.

David E Kelly's policy of revolving doors for his actors have and will see major changes...Season Four attests to this already.

I would have really like to see Edwin Poole return for the Deep End Of The Poole ""Little Jimmys"" addiction case that showed so much promise with Shirley getting some action.  Also a visit from Donny Crane would have kept the continuation of the surrogate son relationship with Denny alive.

The loss of Brad is a serious blunder but the three protagonists William Shatner, James Spader and Candice Bergen can still hold it together. After recovering from the weak word salad gag from the first season, Alan Shore gives a speech to Denny on the balcony about losing his virginity. It is a masterful piece of acting. Shatners reactions are priceless.

The magic that these two have is a wonder to behold.

I don't mind Saffron Burrows. Not at all as good as Tara but still hot.

There are lots of new characters this season. There has been a good cleanout. I love the introduction of the Brit, Tara Summers. She is a very good actor. Her delivery of `the `dog's bollocks' was spot on. The Fat Black transvestite is gone and I for one am glad. I felt his performance was unconvincing in either character. The introduction of John Larroquette is iffy because Cadice Bergun has better taste. Denny would be crushed at how low she has gone. Christian Clemenson is a very good actor. I do hope `Hands' doesn't turn into a lolly pop boy.

The Season has started strongly for a change and ""Do Tell"" is a finely worked play but for that stupid word salad number. James Spader is too good an actor for those unconvincing gags.

Brad Chase played by Mark Valley has left to be a district Attorney, which is a bit of a shock considering the pay cut. What a talent is missing from the threesome. I don't mind the black girl with the wig. Taraji P. Henson. (Is she related to the Muppets? ) It must be hard to enter into a great show with such presence. I think she pulled it off but is it a wig designed by a Henson?

I still miss Tara but I have heard from inside sources that she is shooting people in Hollywood, so beware. Brad, I know I will miss. All hail the threesome.

BOSTON LEGAL: SEASON 3

The first four episodes of Boston Legal Season three are very weak and provide a shaky start to this Classic American television series. Thankfully the following episodes soar in quality and the series returns to its confident and often brilliant best. The standout episodes are ""Lincoln"" and ""On the Ledge"".

The problems with series three are simple. Poor casting is solely responsible for the weaker points in the show. The casting of Craig Bierko and Gary Anthony Williams are serious own goals. Craig Bierko is a comedy actor of sorts and it shows. His scenes have a lack of authenticity about them, as if he knows he is being funny. This actor does not have enough charm or talent to pull off the part of an intelligent and wisecracking lawyer. His underwritten part is not sure whether to be another Alan Shore or Brad Chase when really we need neither. Luckily he is conspicuously absent from all the latter episodes.

Gary Anthony Williams is also a poor piece of casting. The actor is completely unconvincing and overplays his part ridiculously. He never listens to the other actors and continues to mug or make stupid facial expressions, which are distracting especially when he is not the focus of the scene. I think the theatrical term is ""upstaging"". The love interest he has with the Constance Zimmer is completely unconvincing because there is no chemistry between the two actors.

That said the confirmed magic between Shatner and Spader is ever present. It is simply a joy to watch these brilliant actors at work. Candice Bergen is as riveting as ever. She is a wonderful Actor. Mark Valley is constantly underused but when he is lucky enough appear in an episode and show us how good he can be as an actor it often proves to be a highlight of the series.

Constance Zimmer is very good addition to the cast but her part is woefully underwritten. I would like to see her become an honorary man in the eyes of Danny and Shore.

Christian Clemenson delivers a perfectly pitched performance. Julie Bowen as always is perfect. Anthony Heald and the superb Henry Gibson need to be mentioned for their hugely enjoyable performances. All the other cast members are excellent but I would like to see the return of Christopher Rich.

I feel the loss of Parker Posey from the cast roster was a shame as she portrayed a very compelling character that could have caused greater conflict within the Law Firm. I still feel the show misses Tara significantly.

As a whole Season 3 keeps getting better and better because the writers realise that concentrating on the main relationships of the series makes for better episodes.

BOSTON SEASON: One & Two

""Boston Legal"" is that rare American show that is both intelligent and original. The result is a completely compelling and engrossing ""tele-visual feast"".

The almost magical chemistry between Shatner and Spader is remarkable to behold. This is a casting coup if there ever was one. Their relationship is beautifully played and completely life affirming. It is so good to see William Shatner being given the chance to perform in a part that demands of his talent. He has always been an extraordinary showman and it is a crime that it has taken so long to acknowledge just how good he is.
Spader has a charm and perverseness as an actor that is hard to quantify. He has such allure and grace. His delivery of such very complicated and complex speeches is a master class for all in his profession. His performance, as is Shatner's, is simply brilliant!

The actors are of course served with perceptive and enlightened scripts, that cry out for change in modern America. The scripts are never preachy and yet always funny. These scripts are excellent examples of great American screen writing, which more often that not is becoming harder to find.

The casting is generally excellent. The loss of Rhona Mitra in the second series is a terrible blow. She is a very good actor and sorely missed. Mark Valley is also a hidden gem. Some of the best episodes involve his ""Mannix"" aspirations and his bouts of rapid verbal dexterity. The inclusion of Cadice Bergen to the heady mix of Shatner and Spader is a masterstroke. She is such a superb actor with an extraordinary depth. Her ability to deliver speeches with such brilliant clarity and simple emotion is a wonder to behold. Julie Bowen is another great addition to the second series. She is simply excellent. Her range of facial expressions seems limitless! Another casting coup is the inclusion of the talented Parker Posey towards the end of the second series. This is simply an inspired piece of casting. I hope her character will be developed further, as Parker Posey is an actor with a rare talent that includes precise comic timing. Anthony Heald and the superb Henry Gibson need to be mentioned for their perfectly pitched and hugely enjoyable performances. One actor in particular almost steals the show from Spader in the episode called ""Legal Deficits"". His name is Christopher Rich and he plays to perfection a creepy, ingratiating Texas Attorney. The scene between Rich and Spader is one of the most electrifying and satisfying in the whole series.

The only criticism I have of ""Boston Legal"" is the development of the only completely unbelievable character in the series. Catherine Piper played unsympathetically by Betty White. Her performance is completely at odds with the rest of the show and cast. Her performance tries to be funny but is far from it. At one point she tells Alan Shore before his closing ""I hope you're good!"" The line falls completely flat. She then comments after his closing ""I thought you would be better!"" Again the line rings hollow as if it is played knowingly for laughs. This kind of unsubtle acting is simply out of style with the rest of the cast. I keep hoping her character will be written out, as she is the only negative in an almost perfect show, but no! She now quite unconvincingly evicts a young associate from his office and is pushing a tea trolley around!

That said ""Boston Legal"" is an addictive show. One episode is never quite enough! Everyone involved in the show should feel blessed to be working on something truly special and original. This series will soon be regarded as the classic it most certainly is.",1191628800,,8104,4.687543983110485
2870543,4,B000RO6JZE,"While this is a very strong show. Excellent acting with great scripts, this season is somewhat weaker than season 2 which was extraordinary. Indeed, the show has lost some of its more interesting characters, but has also gained a few new ones that do compensate. The cases they take on are slightly weirder maybe than in the past adn there is maybe less light comedy in the cases themselves but this is not only a drawback. Overall it is a pleasure to watch but it is simply not as magical as during the last season. Anyway this is one of the shows to watch at the moment. If you like these law series this is clearly simply the besyt there is around but it could have been better.",1191369600,,681,4.328125
2870544,5,B000RO6JZE,I don't think anything is better that not having to wait through commercials and be disappointed when there is a Barbra Walters special on instead of our show.  Great show with Great characters,1191024000,,193,4.848484848484849

2870569,5,B000RO6JZE,"I have watched this show from day one. I lucked out finding it on t.v one night and have never missed an episode. I tell everyone I know about the show to let them know what they are missing.
The show tackles serious issues and is racy and has lots of innuendo, but it's not a kids show it's for adults.
Shatner and Spader are a wonderful duo. The whole cast male and female is eye candy, but that only adds to my delight watching the show. If only female attorneys looked that great in real life.
Seriously though, I have grown to love not only the long term cast but the guest stars and the characters they play. The character of Jerry Espinson is amazing. I love the whole ensemble. The new additions of Craig Bierko (Jeff Coho) and the characters of Claire and Clarence/Clarice were wonderful too.
I hope the show continues and I'm enjoying this 3rd season all over again preparing for the 4th season next week.
Congrats to James Spader and another Emmy win from the show.
To the writers, directors, and actors all keep up the good work. I can't get enough of this show. It is truly my most guilty pleasure.
I am adding a bit to my original review after watching the first half dozen episodes or so. The 3rd season is darker than I remembered it, and has the usual sexual innuendo but is still great nonetheless. The show brings up relavant social isues and even if you may not agree with the shows views, it does give you something to think/talk about.
Like one of the characters on the show said, ""you have a lawyer here who salutes you while doing pushups (Brad). The woman (Claire) who dates a fellow co-worker  transvestite (Clarice/Clarence). Denny has mad cow disease and dates a midget who comes and goes (Bethany). There's Alan who just can't be explained."" Along with Jerry who purrs and hops and squeals. Also don't forget Shirley Schmidt-ho and Patty.
How could a person not love this show??? Start with season 1 and enjoy all the episodes.",1190160000,19,1956,4.49438202247191

2870571,5,B000RO6JZE,"Boston Legal is one of my favourite television shows (after CSI).  It has brilliant, clever and funny writing and I really enjoy it.  Each season seems to get better and better and the 3rd season is no exception.  Here are the way the episodes go.

10. The Nutcrackers.
Clarice applies for a job as Claire's new assistant, but she'll only hire him as Clarence. Alan's new case is involved in a friendly wager with Shirley.

24. Trial Of The Century.
Alan and Denny resort to a dangerous strategy to create reasonable doubt and get two teenage brothers acquitted of murdering their father. And Shirley gets angry with Jerry and Clarence when they sue a casino.

Each episode is fantastic and while there are some silly senarios in some parts (Jerry Espenson's condition that makes him make animal noises and strange other problems), they do tackle interesting issues in their various trials and cases.  It's so much fun this whole show and I've watched every episode since season 1.  I really love this and hope you do too.",1189641600,9,6968,4.737623762376238

2870573,5,B000RO6JZE,"I just truly LOVE this TV Show, I never ever miss it and if I am ever not home to see it live both my VCR and my DVR are programed to record it.  I currently have Seasons 1 and 2 on DVD and I just cannot wait to receive Season 3 on DVD which is currently on back order with Amazon.com.

I agree with a previous Reviewer; Why do we have to wait so long for it to be released on DVD?  Not good.  Truly one of the very best shows on regular TV.  I thought ""LA Law"" was good but this is much, much, much better by far.

To the entire cast especially to Candice Bergen whom I have always loved, to William Shatner whom I have always admired and followed from the days of Star Trek, and to James Spader whose ""Closings"" in court I have found to be the very best in any Law Show to date, to the directors, producers, writers, remaining cast and to the entire crew keep up the very excellent work.

But season 3 brings us the incomparable Jeffrey Coho (Craig Bierko).  He only stayed for part of the season, but I would love to see his character expanded on into his own series!  Maybe ""Jeffrey coho: Private Eye""?!  Hahaha!  He's a great character and Craig Bierko milked him for all he was worth.  We miss you Jeffrey Coho.",1185580800,7,499,4.53932584269663

I personally relish the political and social statements that are threaded through the show.  Of course the writers are liberal, but since I happen to agree with their views, it's particularly pleasant for me to watch.  There are some very poignant moments in most of the episodes and a subtle undercurrent that's noticeable if you're alert.  This is perhaps the only program that's truly worth viewing reruns.
