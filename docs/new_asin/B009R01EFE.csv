8543821,5,B009R01EFE,"This is a great biography of Criss Angel. He, himself, narrates most of this dvd. It contains a wonderful compilation of his humble beginnings up through his huge successes. It leaves off just after he moves out of the Luxor, and into his lovely mansion.
There are some amazing stunts and magic within this dvd, that clearly shows just why Criss Angel is ""The Best Magician of the Century"".
This is a great dvd for all fans, and also makes for a wonderful gift to someone you'd want to introduce to Criss Angel.
