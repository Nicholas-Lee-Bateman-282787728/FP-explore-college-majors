8114191,5,B000ETQKP6,"My 4 year old loves this DVD!  He finds the color lessons fun and interesting. After he learns a new color combination he tells me all about it. This DVD is good for kids just starting to learn colors and kids ready to learn about color combinations.

The lessons are taught by Bear Bear and Messer, who are totally adorable. My son loves to watch this show with his Bear Bear and Messer plush toys. In addition to the cute characters, the songs are catchy. The other day, my son just started the theme song while we were driving in the car.

My only complaint is that there should be more in this series. When the show was done, my son was asking for more shows!",1307145600,,663,4.246031746031746

8114194,5,B000ETQKP6,"My 4 year old daughter loves Bear Bear and Messer's catchy songs. She likes guessing which color is made by mixing two colors together.  The color identification, visual perception, and matching skills are great for younger children. I would definately recommend this video to parents!!!

8114197,5,B000ETQKP6,"I heard about the Bear Bear and Messer DVD through my weekly get together with some mothers in our neighborhood. They were telling me how their kids were captivated by the music, songs, and cute characters. Based on their recommendation I bought this DVD and I am now a believerhow good this DVD is for my daughter.

My 4 year old daughter is very picky on what she watches. When I played this DVD I didn't know what to expect. The moment the music started she sat down and watched the ENTIRE show. AMAZING!!!!! She was repeating words, learning her colors and more importantly she was fully engaged in the show. She wanted to watch it again after it ended. The characters are so adorable and the music is so catchy that I caught myself singing along too.

Thanks to this show my daughter is learning new words and colors; while I have some time on my hands to take care of other things. :)",1142899200,,890,4.387878787878788

This DVD shows kids what makes up purple, pink, brown, etc.  This was the only DVD that showed the mixture of colors.  My nephews were singing and shouting the colors as they watched the DVD.  A+  I recommend it. Thanks.",1141689600,,286,4.423076923076923
