7801392,5,193034502X,"Sells is a first-rate martial artist, and this video is an excellent production.  It shows not only the three kata from several different angles and different speeds, but shows the bunkai for every move, something all too rare in martial arts videos.  Moreover, his bunkai are realistic, devastating, and not contrived, unlike many ""bunkai"" on martial arts videos.  Bravo to Sells, who also has written one of the best and most complete books on Okinawan karate, ""Unante.""",1281744000,,472,5.103896103896104
