8673765,4,B00MP2FZUQ,"The product itself was great, 5 stars for quality and being what it was supposed to be.  If I'm rating the movies, they are a couple of cultish films one of which is what I bought it for, but not cinematic excellence.  For the movies I'll average 3 stars, giving a balanced 4 star review.  But if you want any one of these movies, for the price it is a great set.",1433721600,,363,4.013888888888889
