5800709,5,B00DHDDE32,"Shutter Island is a great movie that will keep
Most people guessing until the end. It's a psychological thriller better then most that I have seen. When I was in nursing school, I was able to use it for a paper in mental health nursing. I know that I have watched it several times with different people, and some did not understand the ending. Every detail matters.",1469059200,2,365,4.462686567164179

5800712,5,B00DHDDE32,"These are two great Leonardo DiCaprio movies. Shutter Island is a great thriller, but The Aviator is a modern day classic. DiCaprio simply becomes Howard Hughes and should have won the Oscar for his performance. In The Aviator, DiCaprio proves that he is the best actor of his generation.",1454630400,,288,4.8979591836734695

8593149,5,B00DHDDE32,Forgetting the incredible value of this blue package the films are quite obviously evidence of genius. In my opinion nobody ever has or ever will make films like Scorsese. His style is so unique far beyond the Hitchcock esque style of Spielberg or any of his contemporaries Scorsese will go done as the greatest director.,1523491200,,321,4.8545454545454545

8593156,5,B00DHDDE32,Very well done and acted movies. I still am trying to figure Shutter Island out!! Aviator is a well done period type piece. Blanchett and DiCaprio excel,1479168000,,152,4.666666666666667
