3867865,5,B0027M80RE,"My whole family loves this series of greening-your-home episodes. There are 6 episodes included on this DVD, each featuring a different area of the home (i.e. the garage, the backyard, the bedroom etc.) We use it as part of our homeschool curriculum, and have even incorporated some of Bill Nye's earth-friendly recommendations in our household. Bonuses: it's funny and it's even packaged in a container made of recycled materials.",1325894400,5,431,5.260869565217392
3867866,5,B0027M80RE,"This Green Planet Stuff Happens DVD is divided into several shorter sections as it goes through a home looking at energy wasters and energy savers in each room of the house and the back yard.  This makes you take a second look at the things you do everyday.  As always, Bill Nye interjects his style of science humor and lots of fascinating facts.  It is even packaged in recycled material.

This would be good to have in homes, school libraries and public libraries.  I would recommend this for upper elementary and middle school students through adults.  Bill Nye the Science Guy has a quick moving, entertaining, enjoyably nerdy, informative style.",1320969600,4,651,4.872727272727273
3867867,5,B0027M80RE,"I recall watching Stuff Happens on Planet Green when it debuted in 2008, and became fascinated with the effects of the things we do have on the environment. Now while it's disturbing watching the negative effects us humans have on the environment, whether intentional or unintentional, it provides hope by giving us suggestions on small changes we can do to make a difference.

It's a shame they removed this show from the iTunes Store because I had previously bought a couple of the episodes two years ago. I ended up purchasing this DVD, but only 6 out of the 12 episodes made in this series is on the DVD. I would hope that some time in the future the other half of the episodes not on this DVD will be released, so I can purchase it.

I would recommend this DVD, heck in fact, this series to anyone who has a desire to make a difference. Talking about being green is one thing, but actually being green is another. What's great about this show is that you don't necessarily have to be ""green"" to make a difference. In the words of Jessica Simpson, ""a little bit goes a long way.""",1312588800,2,1083,4.41

3867869,5,B0027M80RE,"STUFF HAPPENS is a television series about the environment, set in the context of our everyday world, which was first shown on the Green Channel. I'd thought I was well informed about environmental issues, but I was completely boggled by the important information this DVD series presents concerning ""stuff"" we are doing to our planet and its ecosystems--stuff about which I didn't have a clue. Yikes!

This show could be disheartening and depressing, but, believe it or not, it is actually the opposite; it is uplifting and entertaining. This is because it is the brainchild of Bill Nye, the Science Guy, who presents the segments. He has a wonderfully friendly, nerdy, enthusiastic, completely likable style of delivery that makes one believe maybe we CAN do something to reverse the massive harm we are doing to ourselves and our fellow life forms.

I intend to purchase a copy to donate to my local library. Please re-read the title. Every sentient human being above the age of eleven should have the opportunity of watching this DVD!",1248480000,31,1038,4.959770114942529

8354963,5,B0027M80RE,"This show is amazingly thought provoking. I found it on sale at a Borders several years back and not knowing what to expect, bought it. I'm so glad that I did! This show really got me to think about how to become more green. He doesn't just point out problems, he helps provide solutions. The only negative comment I have is that it only includes half of season one and it's impossible to find the other episodes. I don't have cable so I wasn't able to watch this as it aired on television. I would love it if they released the other episodes on a dvd just like this one. Or at least made it available to download, or pay for on YouTube. I would just like it to become available for us non-cable watchers.",1457049600,,705,4.229629629629629
