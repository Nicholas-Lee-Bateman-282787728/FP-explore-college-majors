8200767,4,B000RHRG62,"The film is about what it takes to get to the top in a sport - the hours, the training and the drive in the pursuit of excellence. And it is also an interesting look at  two swim clubs with distinct value propositions - for one club, its about winning and for the other club, its about the journey.",1393372800,,298,4.0508474576271185
8200768,5,B000RHRG62,"What a joy to watch after seeing all the synchronized swimming events o the Net (few were televised). Although not as impressive as the top international teams, the two American teams of synchronized swimmers profiled here (the Santa Clara Aquamaids and the St. Paul Stars) are talented and unbelievably hard-working. This dvd not only shows excerpts from some of their performances but also takes us behind the scenes to watch the trainings and personal struggles of these swimmers. Now if only we could have some dvds with full performances of all the Olympics champions!",1227744000,6,573,5.1063829787234045
