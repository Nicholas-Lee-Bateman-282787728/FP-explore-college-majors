8173513,4,B000MXWUXU,"Bill Nye takes science subjects and makes them fun by breaking a topic down and showing lots of little aspects in different ways. He's often corny, but able to laugh at himself, and moves from item to item rapidly enough it would be hard to get bored.

In Archetecture he emphasises plans, foundations, form and function, infrastructure, and weight bearing.

My kids, 3, 6, 10 and 13 all love Bill Nye, and the older ones have an excellent grasp of many different science concepts (and a real love of science) thanks to him. You can often take these out in VHS or DVD from your local library, but when they come up for sale at a reasonable price we buy them, as my kids watch them over and over again.",1261958400,2,701,4.384615384615385
