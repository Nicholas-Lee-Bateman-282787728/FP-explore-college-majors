3923200,3,B002FOFX88,I had recorded this from a movie channel and didn't realize I had only recorded the first part....so I bought this because I was too impatient to wait for it to come on again. It's kinda cheesy but I LOVE these cheesy sci-fi flicks and I loved seeing James Van Der Beek and Luke Perry in the same movie.,1360972800,,303,4.1525423728813555
3923201,5,B002FOFX88,This movie was wonderful.  I like James Van Der Beek's acting and he was good in this movie.  The DVD was received earlier than exected.,1356307200,,136,4.4
3923202,5,B002FOFX88,"the storm is non stop action. you never know who will be spying on you next, it could be the CIA, KGB, FBI, YOUR ONE FRIENDS, you can't trust any one, not even the police, your wife. so get ready for a SUPER-GREAT MOVIE. THANKS. dennis.",1337990400,,236,4.1521739130434785
3923203,5,B002FOFX88,"Very interesting movie, as usual David James Elliott did an excellent job with his character. The movie keeps you glued to the TV to see what will happen next.",1320451200,,159,4.517241379310345
3923204,3,B002FOFX88,"This made for TV miniseries is pretty mediocre.  The script has every cliche imaginable in all its subplots; the acting is lethargic; the effects are pretty shoddy.  But it moves fairly quickly and it maintains interest in sopite of its faults.  Unusual bad guy roles for Treat Williams, Luke Perry and David James Elliott.  Jonathan Snipes' musical score is one of the worst I've heard in a while.  Certainly far from a classic, but a guilty pleasure.",1260835200,,452,4.818181818181818
3923205,2,B002FOFX88,"I watched this when it was on NBC and it was pretty bad.  With the exception of Treat Williams and David James Elliott, I was wondering who those others were advertised as stars.  Being I'm not a teenager is probably why I didn't know them.  The split screen scenes are over done.  There are not just 2 scenes at one time but 3 or 4.  Add to that the advertisements for NBC's fall shows along the bottom and it was a confusing mess to watch.  I know those ads will not be on the DVD. Van Der Beek is stone faced thoughout the movie and in my personal opinion a terrible actor.  I am not sure who Teri Polo was but a friend told me they thought she was the news woman killed in the first hour in a cheap rip off of the shower scene in Psycho.  Treat Williams is good in the movie but he does ham it up at times.  If you like this type of movie you might like this one.  I must confess that I only watched it as I am a JAG fan and watched to see David James Elliott who had a small role as the Army General.  NBC heavily advertised that he was in the movie so it was disappointing to see his role so small.  If you are a fan of his just watch the trailer and you will see about half of his scenes. The plot has been done before in other movies made for TV.  This one is overall not very original.",1253664000,3,1294,3.8745247148288975
3923206,5,B002FOFX88,"An academy-award winning film, no, but an enjoyable action flick that never leaves you bored, YES! I only got to see the first half of the film, so I'm looking forward to seeing the whole thing on DVD, with some (hopefully) great special bonus features.",1252800000,2,253,4.644444444444445
3923207,5,B002FOFX88,"The Storm is a amazing movie defeintly one that i thought i wouldn't like until it was on, the cast was incredible from James Van Der Beek to Marisol Nichols it was defeintly a movie that kept you guessing what next even though the plot was more of something from CSI it was a movie that deserves more praise then what it got and for a made for tv movie i give it two thumbs up and will get the movie when it comes to dvd and you will too if you like action and suspense and a story line that will keep you guessing until the end.",1250380800,3,530,3.9166666666666665
3923208,1,B002FOFX88,"There are some key elements to identifying a poorly made film be it television or large screen: Over use of very close up shots, jerky camera activity, silly post production effects, third rate actors, amature CGI, childish script, obvious amature production quality (lighting, fake rain machines, etc), poor acting, action sequences that bore the viewer, incorherent story lines, rediculous computer input sceens with people typing 300 words per minute while talking. There are more I am sure. Most movies contain some of these elements but in general large screen movies contain fewer then small screen do just as a function of budget differences. I tend to give small screen productions a little slack due to these budget challenges.

That said, The Storm is a rare production. It embraces, with reckless abandon, all of the elements of a substandard movie. Bordering on parody, The Storm is almost unwatchable. Treat Williams, the poor man's Harrison Ford, leads a pedestrian cast of hacks sleep walking through this long, very long, two hour (with ads) movie. Needless to say you sould skip this one. If you do rent or, dare I say, buy this POS, I can promise you will want to keep the remote handy for fast forwarding whole segments.",1250294400,7,1239,4.9855072463768115

3923258,1,B002FOFX88,"Aside from the fact it is comically locked into humans as the ultimate force for evil against a helpless planet earth, it's just an ugly storyline.",1390608000,,147,4.6923076923076925
3923259,3,B002FOFX88,Has some of the worst acting I have seen in years.  The background music was annoying....overly dramatic.  I was disappointed with this movie.  Could have been a good story but fell short in my opinion.,1390089600,,202,4.714285714285714
3923260,4,B002FOFX88,"While I like the premis of the movie and I always like disaster movies, this one was really long (done in 2 parts).  They tended to dwell on some scenes like they were trying to drag it out to fill time.  They also kept flashing superimposed still scene shots throughout the entire movie that are beyond annoying and serves no beneficial purpose.  They also didn't merge parts 1 and 2 very well.  They ended part 1 in the middle of a crisis (I'm sure for a cliffhanger effect) and started part 2 after the conclusion/end result of the crisis (which the end result was only shown as news report clips during the opening credits on the second part, and left everything in between out). Other things happening at the end of part 1 didn't pick up where they left off in part 2.  I did like the plot.  As a disaster movie, I liked it.  As a secret government conspiracy/cover-up type movie, I liked it.  I'll undoubtedly watch it again.  I would probably recommend it, but I'd warn everyone about the length of the movie and also the overkill on those still scene shots first.",1385424000,3,1071,4.4512820512820515
3923261,5,B002FOFX88,"The is the best movie I have seen in a long time.  No snoozing in this one.  Keeps you on the edge of your seat with the plots within the plots with in the plots.  For those who think of creating weather control, this is wakeup call beyond all belief.  Loved it.",1376179200,,262,3.980769230769231

3923263,4,B002FOFX88,"I sometimes believe that private businesses tries to tamper with nature.  As this movie showed, they wanted to use the weather as a weapon and it backfired.  It is action pack about the storms. This one guy wants to save the day, and they ended up needing him to do just that.",1369267200,,276,4.288461538461538
