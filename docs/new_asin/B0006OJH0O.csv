2190618,4,B0006OJH0O,"I had always heard about this concert over the years, but most reviews panned it. Well, this reviewer gives it 4 stars. Considering the circumstances under which this show was performed (I direct those interested to read Stanley Booth's excellent book The True Adventures Of The Rolling Stones for all the gory details) it is not bad at all! Obviously under-rehearsed, the band struggle but manage some fireworks on some tunes, but do stink up the place on others. Some will complain about the out-of-tune guitars (see the Woodstock movie; everybody's guitars are out of tune. Same at Monterey Pop)but they hadn't played a concert in a long time. It's fascinating to watch them feel their way back and judging from the results less than 6 months later( The Ya-Ya's LP) their return to the top of the rock heap. Highly recommended!!!

2190619,5,B0006OJH0O,"This is a documentary of a concert which happens to include much of the music, but also much of the atmosphere of the day and the performers. I have watched this several times, and enjoy the energy of the music as well as the other parts of the documentary. I must admit that I do not care that the music quality is not always the best. The power of the concert comes through anyway.",1384819200,,383,4.1891891891891895
2190620,5,B0006OJH0O,some of the reviews led me to think that this item was a waste of money. You can't always believe what you read. The band put on an excellent show considering Brian Jones had just passed away days earlier. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who enjoys the earlier Rolling Stones performances.,1368748800,,301,4.69811320754717
2190621,4,B0006OJH0O,"This disc is afine time capsle for any rolling stones fan energeticly paced, filmed on a warm summers day two days after Brian Jones had died. Funnilly enough the band wasn't playing in tune except for a very nervous Mick Taylor. Roumor is that Mick Jagger and Keith Richard were on a cocaine binge. All things consitered I woud rate video a8-10 and music 5-10 best of all it is worth a look.",1361491200,,392,4.383561643835616
2190622,4,B0006OJH0O,A good DVD for Rolling Stones fans. Good interview footage after the death of Brian Jones. Could be a few more songs in the concert footage section that we haven't seen/heard. Most of it has been released before.,1350172800,,212,4.605263157894737
2190623,4,B0006OJH0O,"My friend and I spent the summer of 1969 in England.  We were heartbroken when we read that Brian Jones had died and knew we had to be at the free concert the Stones were giving in Hyde Park.  We had previously lived in a flat only two block from Hyde Park, but had since moved south of London to Margate to live with another friend.  The three of us ended up sleeping in the park that night to secure a place near the front of the stage.  I have not ever seen any footage until my friend sent me a ""you tube"" of one song.  I was excited to see this DVD and I wasn't disappointed, the day came flooding back to me with each song, and it was great to see it even more up close. The video cut out the part where Mick told the crowd that they were releasing 10,000 white butterflies in memory of Brian.  It was quite spectacular to see this and be a part of it, yet it doesn't really come across that way in the video, so that was a bit disappointing... but probably only to someone who was there.  If you're a Stones fan, and either lived during the 60's or love early footage of the Stones, you'll love this DVD.",1346630400,,1111,4.0227272727272725
2190624,4,B0006OJH0O,"That's all! If you want an improved sound mix, and a 1080p picture. The Blu-ray is now available, and has bonus footage of a kick ass version of Mercy Mercy, Stray Cat Blues, and a partial bit of No Expectations, Mick Taylor doing Brian's slide part. I don't think that's ever been seen before. It's LPCM 2.0 Mono(48kHz/16-bit)but punched up a bit from my Standard Definition version.",1323734400,,384,4.746268656716418
2190625,4,B0006OJH0O,"A must view show for  any stones fans. It is the free show the Stones put on about 2 days after the death of the bands founder Brian Jones. With 500k people scattered about the park the Stones debuted new guitarist Mick Taylor.  The sound isn't great, Mixing is rather poor, and it is clear Mick Taylor has yet to completely gel with the band. But the band play an excellent mix of songs including great versions of Sympathy for the Devil and Midnight Rambler. The ramp of Satisfaction with and even play Loving Cup and Honky Tonk Women two songs that would not be released for another 2 years... Again not the greatest quality DVD but in terms of capturing a moment in time it is a must have.",1318809600,,693,4.323076923076923
2190626,1,B0006OJH0O,"I was also very disappointed in this video. I wanted to see the Stones play but what I got to see was 250,000 skinny,ugly english hippies. You see members of the audenice wearing swastikas I think I saw Hitler sitting in the crowd. I love anything with the Stones and I will add this to my collection but who ever edited this should be kicked sguare in the nuts!",1310169600,2,362,4.260869565217392
2190627,3,B0006OJH0O,"Here it is, on DVD:  The legendary Stones concert at Hyde Park, 1969.  Only days after original member Brian Jones was found dead in his swimming pool.  This was supposed to introduce Mick Taylor to the world but instead became a tribute to Jones.  I had actually found this concert on video many, many years before and it was awful then.  Truth be told, the concert itself is awful.  And I love the Stones!  It's incredible that only a few short months later, they began their '69 US tour and were fantastic.  It's fun to watch this and realize that this was 40yrs ago.  If you're a Stones fan, you simply have to have this DVD, for your collection.  You may watch it only once, but you've got to have it!",1282780800,,706,4.320610687022901
2190628,1,B0006OJH0O,"What a revelation and a disappointment at the same time.

Revelation: Mick Taylor slide guitar featured on Midnight Rambler.

By Sept 1969, the best known and well loved version of ""Midnight Rambler"" no longer features that superb slide guitar presence. Sadly the whole first half is missing on this DVD. Also, the jacket lists 8 songs, but there was actually only five on the movie.

Music movie editors in 1969 had no idea, hence the tright and pathetic interviews and lead in commentary. Including some over the top of the music. It is just as annoying as motor racing videos made at the same time, on which the editor drowns out the sounds of the cars with a crappy music sound track and dinky false racing commentary. Just record the concert and play it complete, please.

I was alive in the 60s. I know what it was like, I don't need to see all the side play in this movie.

This was bought out by Time/Life. My advice is PLEASE go back and find the original film, and re-release just the concert without all the auxiluary nonsense so that we can enjoy the whole concert!",1263859200,5,1077,4.5025641025641026
2190629,4,B0006OJH0O,"Having seen the Stones on their 1972 tour, I believe I have seen them at close if not the height of their performing career.  Anything the Stones did live from 1969-1972 is of interest.  So when I saw the availability of this concert I was immediately intrigued, especially that it was Mick Taylor's first concert with the band two days after Brian Jones' death.  If you are looking for Gimme Shelter or Woodstock caliber recording - don't waste your money on this item.  The editing is often frustrating - like watching faces in the crowd, tree branches or Mick Jagger dancing around the stage when Mick Taylor is throwing down some great slide guitar on Love In Vain.  There's plenty of creative zoom lens crap and other frustrations.  And yes, there are horribly out of tune guitars on Satisfaction.  Despite all of the drawbacks, there is plenty to like.  The seven plus minute rendition of Sympathy For The Devil has a great energy and shows the band transforming before your eyes into the great live act they became a year later.  This show offers plenty of raw energy and authentic rock and roll, even though sometimes it's a little loose around the edges.  There's not a lot of film footage of the Stones from the 1969-1972 era.  This one is well worth the price of admission and will please any true Stones fan.",1261526400,8,1320,4.622317596566524
2190630,5,B0006OJH0O,"Even if not a Stones fan, but a guitar fan, should cause you to watch/listen to this dvd. This was just the beginning of Keith Richards' and Mick Taylors' heavy style of riffing which carried them through the 1970's. A little ragged around the edges, but thats how we like the Stones. Too bad the whole show is not presented here, but what is here, should be savored and enjoyed like nothing else. Very good presentation of a very metallic sounding Stones in front of 200,000 plus people, on their home turf in England. Make sure to watch/listen on good quality home theater system at loud volume(just a suggestion).",1184112000,4,616,4.660550458715596
2190631,5,B0006OJH0O,"As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book ""Take Me To A Circus Tent"" and a former radio disc-jockey, I am often asked to write and or discuss various recordings from the 60's and 70's.

July 5, 1969 is one of the most historic days in rock and roll. The Stones concert in London's Hyde Park would pay homage to the late Brian Jones and usher in the new and extraordinary era of Mick Taylor (1969-74).

For those that have looked to fault every possible second of the event and judge the release on only the musical portion and not include ""The Event"" it is only right equal time is given to counter the unneccesary critisism the gig received.

The typical complaint about any music DVD not recorded with a 34 billion dollar budget to the sound snob is the fidelity doesn't meet the quality standard. In 1969 you were not dealing with digital technology and preserving the moment is worth more stars than how the mix is.

It has been discussed that newcomer Mick Taylor looks nervous. That is earth shattering news. He had less than 48 hours notice the permits were in place and they could perform. If your first show was in front of over 100,000 people and your bandmates lost somebody that they had often spent more time with than their own families, if there weren't butterflies he wouldn't have a heart or soul.

Keith's guitar is out of tune during ""Satisfaction."" There is a first. No musician has ever had this before. It is amazing that any of the Stones could get through the day knowing Brian's departure is now in a permanent sense.

The band isn't inspired. Then why did they play the longest version of ""Sympathy For The Devil"" (19:00) ever performed? If you look at the complete list of songs regardless if they are included or not, they could have easily made the show a hit factory. There are a myriad of tunes that only a hardcore Stones aficionado would be able to name correctly.

There one knock that is justifiable. Surprisingly it is the one thing the Skeptic's hadn't been thrilled to inform every Amazon review reader) the playing time of the DVD does not encompass the entire set. I have listed the songs and next to the ones that aren't found on the DVD will be the letters NF (Not Found).

To Brian Jones thank you for your incredible contribution to the Stones and to Mick Taylor there wasn't a better man for the job.

2190633,5,B0006OJH0O,"If you've read my other reviews, you won't be surprised by this one.

This is a great concert DVD. It has most of my favorite old Stones songs, played with the instruments and musicians of the day. And that is important. You get to hear it as it was. The sound that made them famous, the sound that made them grow into the artists that they are today. Don't get me wrong, I love Darell Jones, Ron Wood and the lovely Lisa Fischer. They weren't there back then though. I only wish we could have heard Brian play his melotron.

The draw back is that it was filmed in 1969 technology also. The picture is a little fuzzy, just like our memories of 1969. The sound isn't 21st century quality either. But hey-- ITS THE STONES MAN!

They devoted this concert to Brian Jones who had just died two days earlier, even though they planned to do it without him previous to his death anyway. There was a rift in the band, largely because Brian Jones was spending more and more time shagging and drugging and almost never showing up for practice with the rest of the band. Real artists practice. Band members practice together. So the founding member got the boot.

Had he come out of his drug induced ""funk"" and not been murdered by the tradesman working around the house, I believe that Brian would have gone on to start another band that would be just as memorable as The Rolling Stones. Also he died, Mick, Keith and Charlie lived and the rest is history.

If you are a Stones fan, this is required viewing. BUY IT. I bought the Korean Import version, but it wasn't a big savings. What are you waiting for... Just buy a copy and watch it!",1169942400,19,1628,4.35973597359736
2190634,5,B0006OJH0O,"The concert in the park was one of two free concerts the Rolling Stones ever performed. With two days since Brian Jones' death to perform, it was well conceived. We were near a small grove of trees toward the left uppper knoll which had a fantastic view. The sound was good and the kindness including a eulogy by Marinanne Faithfull was a blessing. Years later (1997) we had an admission of his being killed by the mason (on his deathbed) and drowned by him in Brain's swimming pool. At the time we just knew this was a good man (founder of the Stones) who had drug and drinking patterns that hindered his talents as a player (won't we all). He was inspired by the great American bluesmen which was the basis of the group. The Hell's Angel's were the security which became unruly, but not like American Angel's. They were soft but did light bonfires near the stage. The moths were incredible set free. We then went on to Isle of Wight to see Pentangle, Bob Dylan & The Band, Family

The Who and more....",1156032000,9,1003,4.421621621621622
2190635,4,B0006OJH0O,"I received my copy of the Stones in the Park Friday night and it was great. I played it four times in a row and I was delighted by both the picture quality and the audio. My copy is Korean( I am Told ) and Iv'e been waiting 40 years for this one. The Stones are out of tune on ""Satisfaction"" and I didn't mind a bit, especially, after two or six Highballs.",1145145600,23,356,3.8904109589041096
2190636,3,B0006OJH0O,"For historical purposes this film rates as a classic. Typical of a late 60s rock show, though, we have Keith's guitar terribly out of tunes at times; especially on ""Satisfaction."" These documents stand as more than just a record of a concert, they give us a small glimpse back at the culture of the late 60s. Very nice dress Mick!",1137110400,8,330,4.516666666666667

2190638,4,B0006OJH0O,"Well.......having seen this (I won't say exactly...""where""), I'm glad to see it's finally being released - legitimately.  Why, certainly the Stones' performance was...uh...but, in all honesty, NO WORSE WHATSOEVER than that recent ""Toronto"" thing - and this has Mick Taylor and Bill Wyman! OK, all histrionics aside, founding member Brian Jones (what an APT last name!) died just two scant days before the Stones performed in Hyde Park, and albatross-around-the-neck though he CERTAINLY was - still - I mean, YOU try to do a gig, knowing a good friend died two days before!  And though Mick Taylor's tenure with the Stones was absolutely the Stones' pinnacle, here, he's nervous - hey, how would YOU have followed Brian Jones? - and it shows.  But still, despite the sloppy performance (and, OMG, PLEASE don't dredge up that dress Mick J's wearing!), ""Hyde Park"" is kind of like being a midwife for a particularly difficult childbirth.  Just compare this to the movie, filmed a scant 6 months later, of the Stones at their very apothesis, ""Gimme Shelter.""  Now the question that ALL Stones fans want to know: Where is it? Just exactly WHO is it that owns ""Ladies And Gentlemen, The Rolling Stones?"" I thought they were finished with Allen Klien by this point, but I may be straying from the point...OK, dig, ""Hyde Park"" is certainly the price of admission!  Buy it, and you'll think Nixon's still in the White House, Vietnam's still going on, no ""live"" band is using a damn synthesizer, you'll worry about what's bugging the Beatles so badly, and you-know-what is readily available at much less than it costs today!",1107475200,10,1614,4.915441176470588

Not only are most songs missing, but the songs that are present are incomplete, having been edited.  Elliot's Complete Recordings suggests that there is a version of this DVD with more songs on it.
