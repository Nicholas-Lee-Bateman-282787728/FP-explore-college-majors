8386399,3,B0030ZOYFO,"While considering whether to buy this DVD, I went to IMDB.com to research the titles.  SOME of the titles are not clearly defined well enough to indicate with certainty if this is the movie on this DVD or not (and I did NOT buy the DVD, as a result of what I found).  That's why I posted a neutral 3-Star rating (neither approve nor disapprove).

Therefore here is my DISCLAIMER:  some of the movies I listed MIGHT NOT be the same ones on the DVD.  In some instances, IMDB.com shows exact TITLE matches for different movies (different actors & different years).  So if you see that I made any mistakes, please feel free to correct my list.  If my list is mostly error, then I'll delete it.  I merely posted this for your benefit and convenience, because I already did the research as far as I could take it, using the scant information provided in the item description and the READER COMMENTS as of the date of my post.
