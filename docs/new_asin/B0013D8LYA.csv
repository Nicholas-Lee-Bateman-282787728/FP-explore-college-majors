8250090,2,B0013D8LYA,"All Creatures Great and Small balances the business of being a vet with the business of living in a roughly equal relationship as memory serves. But this tripe of a series is a little does of animals, the endearing part of the story and a whole lot of drama, poorly acted, and making it not endearing at all.

Thank goodness that there is no US version of season two. Casting wise, what were they thinking of having two such diverse and accent challenged actresses. The lead and elder daughter has such a heavy accent she could never be related to her younger sister nor have grown up in The Chase where everyone else in that part of York sounds totally different. And I write this in America. The Brits didn't notice?

Oy, who slept with who twenty years before, and then repeated the cycle now? Does it matter. The only ones we cared about were the Doctor Partner and Indian Nurse. They were the only ones who we were meant to like. The rest, get rid of them. I can't recommend this to any one. But a reminder, get All Creatures for good story, good acting, and good location shots of great scenery.",1316649600,,1101,4.41871921182266
8250091,5,B0013D8LYA,"I am not going to give away any spoilers, but this series is just swell.  It's way better than a soap opera, but it has situations in it that would fit in a soap opera--in other words, never a dull moment!  This family that runs this veterinary practice is full of rich characters and the writing is quite good.  Watch two episodes and you'll be hooked, and it's likely you'll ""waste"" the day watching the rest of the episodes back to back.

I'm waiting anxiously for the next season!",1255478400,7,484,4.404494382022472
