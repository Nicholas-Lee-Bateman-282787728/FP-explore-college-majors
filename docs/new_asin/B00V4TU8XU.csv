8709227,2,B00V4TU8XU,"The information in the video is good.  The problem with the video is production.
This is a series of Jason Martel's lectures that he is just doing a recorded presentation of.  He has a picture in picture of himself talking to you in the lower part of the screen.  The slide presentation has not been optimized for this and his video covers up much of the data (charts, imagery...) he is trying to describe.
More often than not he is staring/talking at his computer screen highlighting parts of the imagery with his mouse instead of the audience.  This could have just had him narrating without the video of him.  I would assume the rest of the DVD series is more of the same.
The audio is recorded over the computer mic and has that very hollow speakerphone-ish sound.  You can understand what is being said, but sound is annoying.
Overall, lots of potential, but a complete fail on delivery.",1439251200,6,892,4.578616352201258
