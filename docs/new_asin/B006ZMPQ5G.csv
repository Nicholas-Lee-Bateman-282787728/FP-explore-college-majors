This DVD is actually a re-release of a program from several years ago.  In her introduction, instructor Megan McCracken states that ""Box, Balance, & Lift"" is Volume 1 in her Super Seniors series (according to her web site, she also offers a walking program).  The Main Menu of this DVD lists options for Instructional or Main Workout.  The Instructional segment (19 minutes) provides the opportunity to learn the moves at a slower pace.

The Main routine is just under 50 minutes.  Here McCracken leads a class of eight seniors, a few of whom introduce themselves and provide their ages.  Prior to starting the routine, McCracken recommends having a chair, light weights (3-5 lbs.), and water on hand.  One of the participants remains seated in her chair throughout.  McCracken begins the workout with a 5-minute standing warm-up.  She cues simple moves similar to what she previewed in the Instructional portion such as neck and shoulder rolls, tap outs, side pivots, and overhead reaches.  The actual workout starts with marches and includes some of the same moves (e.g., reaches, toe taps, and pivots) performed and a bit quicker pace.  McCracken continues to add exercises such as gentle twists, high knees, and hamstring curls.  She then brings in the ""box"" portion of the routine by incorporating easy jabs forward; she alternates these with marches and speed bags, all performed at a very moderate, easy pace.  Finally, McCracken mixes in additional punches, including the hook and the uppercut.  She concludes this standing cardio segment (20 minutes) by suggesting either repeating this portion for 40-minutes of cardio or coming to seated in the chair.'

Once seated, McCracken alternates a forward crawl move for the arms with flutter kicks for the legs, varying this with a breast stroke for the arms as well.  The next move is standing up and sitting back down in the chair, with the option to hold onto the weights.  (Note:  the one class participant continues to remain seated for this entire segment.)  Following this, McCracken stands next to the chair for several exercises, including step-overs (front-back and side-to-side), toe point-flex, step out-out in-in, and leg circles.  Returning to seated in the chair, the class picks up their weights for bicep curls and alternating front raises.  McCracken then stands again (using the chair for support) for rows and triceps kick-backs.  At the 35-minute mark, there is an onscreen cue to place the weights around the ankles for a series which includes seated leg extensions and standing side abductions, rear leg lifts, calf raises, and hamstring curls.  Finally, McCracken leads a 4-minute stretch to conclude the workout; this is performed entirely in the chair and targets both the upper and the lower body.

In general, this is nice routine for its intended audience of older participants.  Although it will probably be too easy for seniors who have remained active, it should meet the needs of seniors with more limited mobility issues.  One concern I have is that McCracken frequently goes from sitting in the chair to standing and back down again--moving up and down in this manner can be a concern for many older people.  It is nice that she included the option of doing the entire routine seated, but the participant who is performing the workout this way is unfortunately not shown very often on screen.  In the end, this workout definitely should have some appeal to particular groups.

UPDATE, 7/12/15:  I wanted to add that I wound up giving this DVD to my father-in-law, who is over 70.  He uses it regularly!  He is not sedentary--he plays both tennis and golf on a regular basis--but he enjoys using this routine at home as well.  From that perspective, this workout may in fact meet the needs of healthy seniors...just not so much healthy middle-aged people like myself.",1410393600,2,4019,4.992481203007519
8507126,1,B006ZMPQ5G,"I was very disappointed in this DVD. It is appropriate for someone with disabilities or an assisted living program. The brief snippet that is shown is the most vigorous (?) part. This was referred to on the back cover as the ""cardio"" segment, but was not active enough to raise my heart rate into its target zone. This was titled Super Seniors Vol. 1, inferring that there will be more to come. I would be skeptical about future purchases.
The quality of this DVD was poor (lots of skipping). This was a brand new product and there were no visible scratches on the disc.
Ordinarily, I am not concerned about the set where the DVD is made, but this one was bad enough to comment on. There were 8-10 people in the group, and with set design and camera work, they appear to be right on top of each other. They could not have actually been that close or they would have been hitting and kicking each other during the movements. Most of the program was focused on the instructor, rather than the group, but even she appeared compressed in her space. In the end, this was very distracting.
The instructor was very personable, and sincere, and this is the only positive comment I can make.",1375315200,,1182,4.476851851851852
