8164077,4,B000LSBX70,"This was a dvd that I longed to have.  It seems a little disjointed, as it covers the three different competitions at the same time.  I have a few of the season reviews from later seasons, and they seem to be more carefully put together from a production standpoint.  There is a spot where the picture and sound freeze up, which I have noticed on the other dvds from this source.  I suppose that it must be some technical glitch in their recording equipment.  But, overall it is an acceptable recording of their finest season, one where they won three major trophies, all in one whirlwind season.",1359158400,2,596,4.5327102803738315
8164078,5,B000LSBX70,"Every Manchester United fan should buy this DVD.
It is commentated well and has great history of the famous treble winning year. They have highlights of every game.",1353801600,3,164,4.892857142857143
