4708024,4,B005I4HO2U,"I have good news for you, and bad news.  The bad news is these episodes of Dean's variety series are once again significantly cut.  And, more bad news -- you won't find Dean's opening songs here, either, nor his ""Music Room"" songs.  But there is some good news.  The way these were cut is, in my view, better than the first set that Time-Life put out, and despite missing Dean singing, you get a better sense here of how the shows went.

I just don't get what Time-Life doesn't get.  We buy Dean's variety shows to see Dean!  So, for example, on disc 6, we get to see Robert Goulet's number, but not Dean's.  It's nice seeing some of the great stars of that era, but I'd rather see Dean's numbers than a lame monologue by Stanley Myron Handleman. And I don't want to hear that crap that they couldn't get clearance from ASCAP or BMI for the music.  Poppycock.  In the past two years, two of Bing Crosby's DVDs of specials were released -- 9 programs in all...intact.  And in 2001, Capitol released the DVD ""That's Amore"" with 25 of Dean's musical performances.  Bear Records released every Dean Martin audio recording in their comprehensive set of discs.  No problem getting those clearances.  In other words, Time-Life is simply to cheap to pay for the clearances.

But, having said that, there's still a lot of Dean on these discs to enjoy.  We get to see him interacting in his own special way with so many of the great stars of the era.  We see his humor.  Though not what most of us would like, there's still a lot here to enjoy.  And most of us will take Dean any way we can get him!",1321315200,45,1589,4.343537414965986
4708025,5,B005I4HO2U,"UPDATE (11/18/12):

The ""King Of Cool"" 6-DVD set has now been included in Time-Life's newly-released 17-DVD compilation entitled ""Dean's Ultimate Collection"", with the addition of a BONUS DISC previously available only through Costco. For a complete review of ALL of this material, replete with exclusive info, insights, program rundowns and pictures galore, just type into any search engine the title of The Golddiggers Super Site's article: Bundle Up With Dean.

ORIGINAL PREVIEW (10/24/11):

The eagerly-awaited follow-up to the first collection of material from The Dean Martin Show mined from the vaults of its originating network, NBC, and released by Time-Life last spring, this brand new 6-disc set contains 18 episodes culled from the 8 years that the program delighted audiences in the final hour of prime-time on Thursday nights (the series' final season, retitled The Dean Martin Comedy Hour, was moved to Fridays, with a modified format largely remembered for its introduction of the Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts).

But it's the episodes comprising this new ""King of Cool"" collection that offer a representative sampling of the series' heyday, spanning the last show of its fledgling season (1965-66) to the final episode of its 8th season, telecast in the spring of 1973.

What's not known as of this writing (10/24/11) is how much of the programs' original musical content has been able to be retained in the transfer to DVD. Last spring's first outing reminded us of some of the harsh cuts that can result from the high costs and myriad complications of licensing copyrighted musical works, and we may need to brace ourselves for some similar edits in this second edition. Even so, the promised inclusion of 128 musical performances, as well as the rarity and diversity of many of the episodes chosen, make ""King of Cool"" a hands-down must for true fans of both Dean and his series.

For an exclusive rundown of the original air dates and guest stars of all 18 episodes featured in this new 6-DVD set, simply copy and paste (or type) into any search engine the words: Updates/The Golddiggers Super Site.",1319414400,14,2119,5.0922190201729105

Highlights are, respectively: Tim Conway, Duke Ellington and an impressive set of celebrity impersonations by the Riddler, Frank Gorshin; Bob Newhart (in his 'button-down' days), Tony Bennett and a touching appearance by Dean's son Dino; Paul Lynde and Marty Feldman; and, the funniest of the lot, Peter Sellers (as every character imaginable), Rodney Dangerfield, Dom Deluise and Nipsey Russel.  There are also lots of song-and-dance bits and plenty of Mr. Martin's trademark 'affably tight' persona.  I'm a little too young to have caught any of this the first time around, and I was never inclined to order the whole shebang from late-night TV, so it was a real pleasure to find this mini-time capsule, particuarly for Sellers, Newhart and Dangerfield.  Somewhat choppily edited, but for a few bucks much better than a kick in the head.  3 1/2 stars.",1333929600,7,1204,5.0606060606060606

After the voice over introduction of the acts in the beginning, and the closing credits showed so much heavy editing of the lost acts. I have always enjoyed watching the supporting acts of magicians, jugglers and variety acts. What happened to them?? A gross injustice to the name of Dean Martin Variety Show.

""King Of Cool: The Best Of The Dean Martin Variety Show""
(Time-Life, 2011)
-----------------------------------------------------
Like the similarly titled ""Best Of The Dean Martin Variety Show"" collection from last year, the 6-disc ""King Of Cool"" box set will prove both a blessing and a vexation for Dean Martin fans.  The good part is that a bunch more classic material from his old TV variety show is available on DVD, and that these discs also gather individual shows (May 5, 1966, April 12, 1973, etc.) but the bad news is that these shows are heavily edited, due to difficulties getting the rights to all the performances.  Sometimes, as the end credits roll on a show, you get glimpses of the skits and artists you didn't see on the disc. Alas, that's just how it is... Might be different in some future edition, but for the time being, we'll have to take what we can get.

As with the other volumes, this is a fascinating pop culture time-capsule. Launched in 1965 and lasting for nine years, NBC's ""Dean Martin Show"" was a major fixture on the television landscape during the peak years of the hippie era and a signpost of the Generation Gap. Although it was a prerecorded production, the premise of the Dean Martin show -- a loosey-goosey variety show hosted by a permanently sozzled sot -- often gave the show a live feel. A big part of the fun was laughing along while Martin flubbed his lines or lost his place while reading cues cards, all with an air of intentional, good-natured self-deprecation. Martin's high spirits, informality and unpredictability made his guests have to think on their toes - while some musical numbers and comedy bits were tightly directed, the show's real sizzle came when Martin interacted with his guests, goofing around and cracking them up, maintaining the back-slapping frat-house feel of the ""celebrity roast"" shows he often hosted. It's a chance to see a bunch of old-school film and music stars letting their hair down, sort of like one long continuous blooper reel, and a backstage window into the showbiz culture of yesteryear.

This particular volume has some A-list talent, including Louis Armstrong, a young Bill Cosby, Ella Fitzgerald (on two shows, in 1966 and '67), Johnny Mathis, Frank Sinatra (and on different episode, his daughter Nancy) and a wide array of now-obscure club performers and Hollywood old-timers, as well as a few surprisingly strong musical guests, such as Herb Alpert, Herman's Hermits, The First Edition, and the Supremes. Dom Deluise makes several appearances, as does Ruth Buzzi, and of course the show's scantily-clad girlie chorus, the Dingalings (aka the Goldiggers.)  There's also a noteworthy 1966 appearance by the Sid & Marty Krofft Puppets (several years before their dominance of Saturday morning kids TV in the '70s)

There was also lots of on-air improv, unscripted chaos that was the closest Americans could get to the wild-and-wooly days of early live TV a decade earlier. Fans of David Letterman in particular might appreciate Martin's deconstructionist approach to the medium, underscored here with an appearance by TV pioneer Sid Caesar. Several comedians who were staples of late-'60s/early-'70s TV are present: Bob Newhart, Flip Wilson, Nipsey Russell, Rowan & Martin and Jonathan Winters, as well as less-well remembered folks like the brassy, sassy Dorothy Loudon.

As with earlier releases, this collection this will bring back memories and laughs for old-timers and give future generations a glimpse back into an antique pop culture during a time of major social transition. It be a bit jarring for our generations to see the casual sexism, homophobia and bizarre racism of Dino's scene (as in a skit where Art Carney, playing Thomas Jefferson, says he was only buying slaves because he wanted to give Philadelphia a winning basketball team... ouch.) It's a very different time and a very different culture than today, yet part of the same American heritage. And certainly a good opportunity to see many of the stars of yesteryear performing in a relaxed, informal setting.  (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1327104000,15,4170,5.140117994100295
