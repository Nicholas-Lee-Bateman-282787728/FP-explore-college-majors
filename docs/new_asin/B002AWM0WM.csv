8360477,5,B002AWM0WM,"Watched last night,and not a bad show in the set. My favorite was Dream Job with a very charming Vincent Price doing a performance that recalls his pal George Macready's earlier performance as Ralph Hughes in the excellent MY NAME IS JULIA ROSS.an Duryea features in 2 presentations,one a comedy with Jack Benny,the other a drama with Beverly Garland.",1492473600,,351,4.966101694915254
8360478,5,B002AWM0WM,"Great DVD of classic TV, with episodes of Four Star Playhouse, The Star and the Story, Suspense, Hollywood Half-Hour, and even the Jack Benny Program representing TV noir of the fifties and early sixties. The transfers of these old shows are of very good quality and I had no problem with any of the soundtracks. Some were kinescopes, so bear that in mind, but this is a fun DVD if you like older TV shows.",1462924800,,406,4.426666666666667
8360479,1,B002AWM0WM,"I have Golden Age Noir via interlibrary loan in wisconsin, from which I made a copy.  My version had Merle Oberon as the first episode.  These all appear to be tv shows and not legitimate Noir, no matter how many shadows there are. TV shows may have Noir qualities.  Strictly speaking though, they're not Noir.  Someone above wrote what episodes there are in Golden Age Noir 2.  Mine has Merle Oberon in the first episode.  I suspect the episode list contributed above is from Golden Age Noir  2.  My copy says Golden Age Noir and there are 7 episodes from 1952-1953. Mine is likely the first volume of the same set.",1450051200,,616,4.486486486486487
