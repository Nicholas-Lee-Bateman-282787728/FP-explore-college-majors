8007072,4,B000161052,Great rtrospective viewing for the Kiwis out there. Shaun harris gets the rewards after 10 years of dedication. Triump comeback with Anstey winning. Also McGuiness is starting out on his record winning run of trophies - Good as quality that could be expected for the 03 tech. Transponder timing heli cam all help to improve the viewing,1390089600,,335,4.894736842105263

8007074,5,B000161052,"Nothing like it! A 37 mile course through mountains and public streets at mind-boggling speeds.  View it from the air, standing on the side of the course and of course from on the bikes.  Be on the edge of your seat while on the bike overtaking a slower rider at 150 mph then switch to the bike being overtaken.  You know that excitement/scarry feeling in your stomach when you are riding too fast?  You get a bit of that feeling watching this DVD!  Want to be on a bike at racing speed for the whole course?  You've got it! Big bikes, small bikes, sidecars... it's got it all!",1074470400,7,577,4.296296296296297
