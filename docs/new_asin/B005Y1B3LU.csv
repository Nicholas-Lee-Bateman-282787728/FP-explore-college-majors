4904094,4,B005Y1B3LU,"Having been a very longtime fan of the original DAY OF THE DEAD, I'm one who naturally gets excited when I hear the word REMAKE! I know the filmmakers best intent is to honor the original as best they can and to make it there vision as well i.e. DAWN OF THE DEAD, THE THING, THE FOG, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, HALLOWEEN, TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, FRIDAY THE 13TH etc. I could go on. well, same here. director Steve miner is an old pro at this firmly establishing himself as a horror filmmaker icon making FRIDAY THE 13TH PARTS 1 and 2,HOUSE,HALLOWEEN H2O, and doing genreless fare like FOREVER YOUNG and SOUL MAN and others. And when i found out he was remaking this I got super excited because I'm a fan of Steve miners work. well he did not let me down with his reboot of this classic. of course this version did not get a theatrical release but, like the original, has found its audience with 'ZOMBIE GORE FREAKS"" like me on dvd. I LOVED IT!!! Mena suvari is great as the new SARAH. The zombie action is intense and there is no shortage of zombie gore although not as intense as Romero's film gore hounds will be pleased. The plot has, of course, changed. Instead of an underground bunker survivors are trapped in a small town. And there is some silly humor in it as well but it is what it is. Millennium films did a good enough job with at least providing a commentary with Steve and the cast and the sound is 5.1 digital and DTS for those of you wanting to crank it up a bit, DO IT! Obviously the dvd and blu rays did well enough for the big wigs that be had to make a 3D version recently, Whatever. I basing my review based on the 2D version of DOTD I have not seen the 3D version and don't plan to cuz I do think it would be weak. I do agree AND IN MY OPINION it would suffer being in 3D. some people who have responded to my review has said so and i believe you. But people please some of you who made comments obviously did not read my whole review. And no I do not work in the business! hahaha that was funny. In any event, if you love zombies then by all means make this a part of your DEAD collection. Stay scared!",1328400000,,2125,4.12289156626506

I am more interested in the 3D than I am in reviewing the movie so I don't recommend it in 3D.

The 3D version has the absolute WORST 3D graphics I have ever seen.  The movie is pretty much blurry the entire way through.  It's not the glasses or TV (I checked, switched glass and even put in another 3D movie).  It's the actual movie itself.  I don't recommend wasting the money on the 3D version since you can't enjoy it as the quality is horrendous!",1329436800,,530,4.357142857142857
4904099,1,B005Y1B3LU,"POST-PRODUCTION 3D (converted from 2D to 3D)

My ratings are based mainly on the QUALITY OF THE 3D, not the video content.

OOS EFFECTS:
There are 4 out of screen effects that extend about 10% of the way, from the screen to the viewer. 3 effects made it to 25%, 4 at 30%, 1 at 45% and 1 around 50%. The effects consist of glass breaking 3 times, flakes floating once and the remaining 9 are blood spattering. THE EFFECTS ARE VERY CHEESY! Not because they are OOS, but because they are poorly done graphics. The blood splattering is many times, just flat (simplistic or no shading) red blobs flying out.

IN SCREEN / OBSERVATIONS:
Personally, I get a kick out of most of the 2D ""Dead"" movies so I knew I would be purchasing this even though it's a conversion. I placed my order and hoped for the best BUT this (fake 3D) conversion can only be classified as JUNK.

I consider this movie to be a consumer rip-off and will be very cautious of buying a 3D by ""WORLDWIDE FX"" ever again. These are the people who also did the 3D work on ""Drive Angry"", another film with some nasty crosstalk.

The quality of the in screen depth cannot be judged fairly on a (my) active system. Passive system users may find this movie watchable but still very cheesy.

Save your money for something better and skip this one.

ACTIVE GLASSES USERS:
The 3D in this film is horrid to watch with its continuous stream of crosstalk. If you feel you MUST own this 3D OR if you are reading this review after your purchase; don't start using this disc for a coaster just yet. THERE IS SOME HOPE. If you use your TV menu to turn the 3D setting all the way down (called `view point' on a Samsung); the crosstalk can be reduced by over 75%. On the downside, you will also decrease the depth by doing this and even with the maximum reduction there still is a lot of crosstalk. If you try this, make sure you return your TV to the original setting or all your 3Ds will suffer.
Best case scenario; use a 2D version and let your TV convert it. The OOS effects are not worth putting up with all the ghosting.
(crosstalk varies from system to system)

MY 3D RATING = POOR  (poor, fair, good, very good, excellent)

Note: As far as the percentages go, everyone's eyes are different. What I see at 25% you may see at 15% or 35%. To fully realize how far something is out of the screen for you, pause on an effect and direct a partner with an extended finger to the tip of what you are seeing. You may be surprised.

4904100,4,B005Y1B3LU,"Follow-up 2/17/2012: To set the record straight it seems important to add that I viewed this 3D Blu-ray movie on an LG Cinema Series (Passive) 3D TV. This 3D model HDTV appearantly does not have the ""crosstalk"" or ""ghosting"" problem that Active 3D shutter TV's can have (which also bothers my wife's eyes).
The 15+ 3D Blu-ray movies we watched have been bright, sharp, and detailed. The 3D dimension is also better than the few we viewed in 3D at the Movie Theater. My personal score of Day of the Dead 3D: Movie **** 3D Quality ***  End of Follow-up.

There are alot of negative reviews which are not justified in my opinion. I suspect this is because Day of the Dead is not a serious Zombie Horror like 28 Days. It is more of a horror movie in a style like Tremors. A scary good time movie.

I own just about every Zombie movie made and this is one my favorites.

The main actors, Mena Survari, Ving Rhames, Annalynn McCord and Nick Cannon do a good job in keeping the story interesting and exciting from beginning to the end. The Zombie makeup and CGI scenes are very realistic. There are some gory scenes but they are not repulsvive. There are several quick splattered blood scenes that provides one of the best ""In Your Face"" 3D effects I have seen.
Warning: Whenever this happens you will be ducking in your seat to avoid getting splattered with blood.

This is not a serious Zombie story nor is it only a comedy. Day of the Dead has just the right mixture of scares and comic relief to make it a funny scary Zombie movie that I enjoy everytime I watch it.

The new 3D version is worth adding to your 3D Collection just for the cool blood splattering 3D scenes alone.

I gave it 4 stars for entertainment value. It is definately not a 1 star ""worse"" movie unless someone bought the movie expecting a zombie story that is gritty and terrifying.",1329004800,5,1849,4.420588235294118
4904101,1,B005Y1B3LU,"OK as for the Movie itself,  I had bought it before and thought that it was not the worst remake one could have done.  But the attempt at making this movie 3D is a joke, I only saw about 3-4 shots that were added for 3D effect.  Some shots had added 3D Blood coming at you,  and then when the windows in the hospital broke as zombie hoards jumped out the broken glass was digitally added like the blood to look 3D.  I can personally take the 2D version and convert it to 3D using Corel WinDVD 11 and get a much better 3D movie than what this movie company attempted to do....  HEY MOVIE MAKERS  if you wanna convert anymore movies from 2D - 3D  then please call me,  I can do it for you in about 10min 99th of the budget and it would be much better than this attempt at getting us sheep to re-buy these sad attempts at 3D conversion.

4904104,1,B005Y1B3LU,"Let me start off by saying I didn't mind the movie (I liked it enough to buy it on DVD, Blu-Ray and Blu-Ray 3D!) - However, many were not fans of this remake, and I can definitely see why (a somewhat poor remake, starring a less-than-stellar cast). With that said though, it is a zombie movie and you can't expect too much out of it -- it's a ""turn your brain off and watch the zombies do what they do"" movie. For more information, read the reviews at:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Day-of-the-Dead-Blu-ray/dp/B001DM3Q3C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Day of the Dead [Blu-ray</a>].

I'm here to focus on the Blu-Ray 3D.

Right off the bat, I was skeptical of how this would turn out - this isn't Sony, Warner Bros, Universal or Disney releasing this.. it's ""Millenium Entertainment""  (and from what I can tell, their first 3D title). Still, I wanted to give it a chance (and went in with expectations that it wouldn't be as good as those other studio releases, to avoid disappointment)
Next problem - this was a 2D title - it was filmed in 2D and converted to 3D. Even the big studios can't perfect this, but they at least make it somewhat watchable (most of the time...), so again I went in expecting that.

[NOTE: While the cover shows a red and blue ""3D"" logo - this is a Blu-Ray 3D, which requires a 3DTV and 3D Blu-Ray player. It will not play in 3D using the red/blue glasses.]

I really wanted to like this, but from the moment the logos appeared before the film, I knew I was in for trouble. Ghosting galore [Note: 'ghosting' (or double-images) are due to the TV - with that said, I'm using a Panasonic DT30 which is one of the better 3DTV displays out there in terms of ghosting - of the other 46 Blu-Ray 3D titles I own, this is the only one I'd consider ""unwatchable"" - ghosting is slightly visible once in a while on other titles.. on this one, it's a CONSTANT thing present throughout the film].

The next problem is the 3D. You figure with all that ghosting, there has to be a lot of 3D going on.. right? ....right?

Now here's the complete dealbreaker. From what I can tell, there really wasn't any 3D. I shouldn't say that.. there wasn't any ""depth"" or ""popout"" like you expect during 3D movies. Everything seemed flat, but instead of being flat at the front of your TV, it seems they made it flat and pushed it into the ""background"" of the TV about 1 foot.

Now, with this being converted, I wasn't expecting to see clear depth/detail in the open mountain landscapes.. but I expected some depth! Everything was completely flat, just pushed back into the TV. Even switching to 2D mode only showed difference in that the image appeared at ""front of the TV"" depth. I really couldn't believe this, and kept waiting, knowing that ""the 3D has to be coming soon!"".. but it never did.

I waited and waited, but it just never came! After 15 minutes, I decided to chapter-skip around to some of the more action'y scenes but there was no change.

The only 3D was on the main menu (which surprisingly looked very good and ghost-free!).

Audio is in Dolby 5.1 TrueHD. No extras on the disc (the original 2D release did have a commentary and alternate ending). Single disc that has both a 2D+3D version (according to the box) - I didn't notice an option to switch to 2D (which would at least make the disc watchable!) on a 3DTV.

No slipcover with this release.

My honest guess is that they tried to mass-convert the title from 2D to 3D by just using the same image for the left and right eye, but spread apart. A lot of people (on ""that popular video sharing website"") seem to think the same, and the result is terrible. To make 3D work, you need to do more than use the exact same frame for the left and right eye - different parts need different separation, otherwise everything looks completely flat and pushed back into the back of the TV.

People say ""Clash of the titans 3D"" is bad, they say ""My Bloody Valentine 3D"" is unwatchable.. they say ""Green Lantern 3D"" is a terrible conversion.. they obviously haven't seen ""Day of the Dead 3D"".",1328572800,18,4091,4.56343792633015
