1988358,3,B0001CLEFM,"Notable for wasting the talents of Vincent Price, Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, and John Carradine.  The plot, such as it is, deals with a smug writer (Desi Arnaz, Jr.) who makes a bet with his publisher that he can write a crappy novel in 24 hours.  His publisher sends him to a Welsh manor in the middle of nowhere so he can write in peace and quiet.  But as the house quickly begins to fill with loonies, and murder soon ensues, however will he finish his book and win the bet ($20,000)?

The plot was partially lifted from an Earl Derr Biggers book Seven Keys to Baldpate.  The rest was trifle served up as cold ham on rye.  There are three false finales, none of which satisfy.  The supposed twist within a twist is ludicrous, disappointing, and completely negates everything that proceeded it, making the whole movie a moot point.  It doesnt help that the main character is unlikable.  If not for the novelty of four major horror stars appearing together, this movie would have been a complete waste of time.  They are a joy to watch, even in a crummy vehicle such as this.  (Peter Cushings accent is hilarious.)

So I am torn.  I loved every scene they appeared in and cringed every time Arnaz insinuated himself into the same scenes.  I kind of, sort of, almost, but not quite, loved it.  Ill whittle that down to it was barely okay.",1475971200,,1343,4.491735537190083

1988390,4,B0001CLEFM,"HOUSE OF THE LONG SHADOWS
another one of Cannon's spoofs, making fun of old classic films from the 70's
Produced by CANNON FILMS Menahem Golan & Yoram Globus
who decided, well Menahem Golan made the Decisions on what films Cannon should make
Yoram Globus mainly did the Financing side of the business
anyway Menahem wanted to do a Gothic/Haunted house theme of the 70's like the Hammer films & Amicus films did
Menahem wanted to get all the Gothic Horror stars from the 70's to star in this 1 film
being Vincent price, Christopher lee, Peter cushing, John carradine
ofcourse being a Cannon film Menahem didn't focus much on the script Menahem just wanted these Lengendary Actors
to be in the same film together really, regardless if the script was Good or bad it didn't matter
Menahem managed to get British director Pete walker to Direct the film
obviously Legends Christopher lee & Peter cushing & Vincent price weren't acting much at all back in the early 80's
infact Vincent price was on the brink of retiring from Acting so they all did film for extra cash

the result is the film turned out to be more of a comedy parody/spoof of the 60's & 70's style Haunted house/Gothic theme
than an actually thriller/Horror with all 4 stars in it so the film didn't make much money at all, if any money
back in 1983 when the film was released in cinemas.
Kino Lorber has gained the rights to release the film on blu-ray now with new extras aswell
Kino have given the film a new HD transfer in 1:85:1 ratio with a new master audio 2.0 mix
the picture quality looks excellent much sharper & clearer than the old dvd version, hardly no Grain or Dirt
there's also new interview with Director Pete walker who reminicces about making the film
working with Cannon, working with the Actors in the film etc- interview goes for 15mins
there's also 2 new commentaries, Pete walker also does a new commentary
which is boring there's a lot of pauses mainly cause Pete was having Difficulty remembering filming some scenes
you know he's about 78 years old so this commentary is waste of time listening to it
personally i think the new on camera interview is more substantial than this commentary
well there's a new 2nd commentary track which is more informative of course, a commentary with Film Historian David del valle
who has alot to say about this film etc
so the 2nd commentary is worth listening to, than the 1st & than the usual Theatrical trailer is included aswell
maybe 2 stars for the film itself, it's a Cannon film production so most of Cannon's films are very average quality
about 4 stars for this new blu-ray reissue based on new HD transfer & new extras",1464393600,,2651,4.5928270042194095

1988395,3,B0001CLEFM,"Not a bad little horror flick, which catches some of the genre's true giants in their latter days (John Carradine, Vincent Price, Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee).  The main problem is not only multiple endings that leave you wondering what really just happened, and the leading actor - Desi Arnaz Jr.  This is clearly a case of familiar Hollywood nepotism, which has placed a fairly competent actor in a role that was above his pay grade and acting ability.  He's tiresome at best.",1459209600,,481,4.841463414634147

1988397,2,B0001CLEFM,"Even though this was a tribute film, as was clearly stated by the director in the extra's, it just wasn't that good. The plot wasn't very good and I didn't like the main star, Desi Arnez. While I love Peter Cushing, I like him in sinister roles, not roles in which he plays the nice old man or the absent minded professor. John Carradine was very old at this point (it seems like he was always old!), almost to the point where it doesn't seem like he's John Carradine anymore. Christopher Lee was probably the best of the lot playing his typical role.

Ultimately, it just wasn't a very good movie. Even though there is a reason for the dumb behavior of the characters that is revealed at the end, it just doesn't seem to make it much better.

Essentially this movie is for completists and for fans of Hammer Horror and Amicus movies.",1457136000,,834,4.409090909090909

1988418,5,B0001CLEFM,"Great looking blu-ray (although a tad dark) and worthwhile commentary track. I was inspired to watch the earlier versions (available from Warner Archive). The earliest version in that set maintains the twist bookending, whereas later adaptions go for a more standard ""old dark house"" film. That the 1983 adaption returned to the bookending and also incorporated some details from the other versions, made me appreciate it even more.",1450915200,,432,5.367647058823529
1988419,3,B0001CLEFM,"I agree with other viewers who reviewed this film on the video quality; whatever print they did the video transfer from was muddy and horrible.  It might as well have been called House of Total Darkness in that regard.  The movie itself, however, was alot of fun.  There's the slightly flawed premise of a writer trying to write an entire novel in 24 hours for the viewer to deal with.  Stephen King, one of the most prolific writers of the 20th century (what's he up to now, 50 novels?), a workaholic and a fast writer, said in several interviews that he writes on average 8 to 12 pages a day, 15 if he's really hot with an idea.  Even a short novel would be a minimum of about 150 pages, so the whole novel in 24 hours idea is ludicrous.  But once you get past that, the movie sucks you in.  Desi Arnaz, Jr. wouldn't be my first pick as a leading actor, but his brisk, prone-to-action young American persona is a good counterfoil to the more staid English actors.  Julie Peasgood was charming and sexy in an endearing, frightened doe kind of way as the love interest.  Then there are the greats:  Chrisopher Lee, Peter Cushing, Vincent Price, and John Carradine.  Lee, Cushing, and Price all knew one another as young actors in London in the 1930s, and Carradine was a pal of theirs in New York; that long standing friendship shows through in alot of places during the film, and you get the sense that they're all having a great time acting together.  Their characters are set pieces that veteran actors of their background could do in their sleep [Lee is mysterious and menacing, Price is the slightly eccentric, urbane aristocrat, Cushing does a nicely underplayed performance as the weak, ineffectually genteel younger brother, and Carradine steps out of his dotty old codger persona to be commanding as Lord Grisbane], but they do them well.  The ending was a little hokey, but still lended to the 'it's all in good fun' vibe you get from the actors.  All in all, I'm not disappointed that I saw it.",1450742400,,2005,4.548746518105849

1988439,4,B0001CLEFM,"Christopher Lee. Vincent Price. Peter Cushing. These horror titans starred pretty frequently in the same movies together... but oddly, there is only one movie that stars all three equally.

That movie was ""House of the Long Shadows,"" which lays out a wide array of classic horror tropes -- a spooky old house, a slasher killer, gore, ugly old secrets, and plenty of gruesome deaths. But this movie is far cleverer than the sum of its parts, with a twisty finale and a heavy metafictional slant that makes perfect sense in retrospect. And of course, it has a powerhouse cast of well-beloved actors, including Price, Cushing, Lee and John Carradine.

Cynical young author Kenneth (Desi Arnaz Jr.) makes a bet with his publisher: he'll churn out a gothic novel within twenty-four hours, just so he can prove that those books are no big deal. The winner gets twenty thousand dollars. The publisher also gives him the keys to an abandoned Welsh manor belonging to the Grisbane family, ""Baldpate"" Manor (since the actual name is hard to pronounce or spell). But when he gets there, Kenneth discovers that the Grisbanes aren't quite as gone as he expected. Lord Grisbane (Carradine) and his religious daughter Victoria (Sheila Keith) have been living there, pretending to be the caretakers.

And in short order, more people arrive:
-Melodramatic Lionel Grisbane (Price) and his weepy brother Sebastian (Cushing).
-The publisher's secretary, Mary (Julie Peasgood), who has been sent to sabotage Kenneth.
-A hiker couple whose marriage is falling apart.
-Corrigan (Lee), a wealthy businessman who has just purchased the house.

And soon they learn the horrifying secret of the Grisbane family, which has haunted and ruled them for many decades... and which has led to everyone now being stalked by a vengeful psychopath. With no way to escape (slashed tires) and a storm raging outside, the people in Baldpate Manor will have to do their best to stay alive in the hours before morning... but Kenneth soon discovers that there are even more secrets being kept by those around him.

On the surface, ""House of the Long Shadows"" is just another cliche horror movie. But between the casting (four beloved horror icons) and the metafictional slant of the story (Kenneth's whole reason for being there is to write gothic suspense), it soon becomes clear that this story is more of a love letter to gothic horror. Yet it never becomes precious or self-aware in its storytelling, and after awhile it becomes a genuinely suspenseful, gruesome mystery.

For the most part, the story follows the ""isolated house"" model of horror, where nobody can leave and someone is picking the inhabitants one by one -- and it becomes obvious eventually that the murders are not just aimed at the Grisbanes. Most of the murders are grisly and violent (acid, piano wire, heart attack from a grotesque dummy), and director Sheldon Reynolds cloaks the story in a thick layer of murky paranoia and thunder. Under the tongue-in-cheek dialogue (""Filled with things best not spoken of. Yes, I saw the movie. You do know how to get there?""), there's the simmering sense that no one in this house can trust anyone else.

It also has a very unique ending. Without giving too much away, it has not one, not two, but THREE twists to the grand finale. That's a pretty impressive feat for any story, and all the more impressive in a fairly simple, straightforward horror tale.

And of course, it has a glorious cast. Much of the spotlight is on the horror trio: Lee is intimidating, brusque and impatient with all these aristocratic melodramas; Price is gloriously dramatic, while still being subtle enough to avoid scenery-chewing; and Cushing plays a sensitive wibbling guy with a lisp. John Carradine also is pretty fun here, although he doesn't have much to do but wear a fez and yell at people. Compared to these guys, the younger actors have a little trouble standing out, but Arnaz and Peasgood give decent enough performances as the cynical ""modern"" author and his love interests.

""House of the Long Shadows"" is partly a love letter to gothic horror, with classic horror actors playing beautifully off one another -- but the meta slant and the twist endings make it a delight as well. A fun tale to watch on Halloween.",1444521600,,4278,4.914127423822714

First of all let me assure you I am not involved with Amazon, or the movie industry in any way, nor have I ever been. Have NO hesitation about ordering the Blu Ray disk, it is spectacular!
I first spotted this classic on Netflix with Vincent Price, Christoper Lee, Peter Cushing, and John Carradine how could I go wrong? Well I'll tell you, It was so dark that 10 to 20% of the movie was completely blacked out. I searched it out on line and that version was worst. Then I thought I'll buy the ""official"" MGM version on DVD here at Amazon, still as dark or darker than Netflix.
I had read that Kino Lorber had bought the rights and had promised to ""Lighten"" up the film with their Blu Ray release and let me tell you that now you can enjoy every frame.

1988464,4,B0001CLEFM,"HOUSE OF THE LONG SHADOWS is a 1983 horror parody that should be appreciated for what it is. It is not a serious horror film and one figures this out not long into the film. A young writer, Kenneth Magee (Desi Arnaz Jr.) bets he can write an amazing opus within 24 hours, and to set the mood goes to an isolated Welsh manor. Before long, he discovers that he is not the sole occupant of the manor, and as the evening progresses, more visitors pop in.

This film may not be great but what makes it eminently watchable is the performance of the mostly all-star cast - my favorite horror icons are in this, such as Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee, and Vincent Prince, and also there's John Carradine. They are amazing as always, and considering this is more of a parody that a true horror film, I had great fun watching their performances and I can't help but think they had a grand old time as well.

The score reminds me of those cheesy 80s horror flicks, but the lighting is truly awful. I watched this as a Prime Instant Watch and was appalled at how dark the film was. I hope something can be done about this and perhaps a better print quality will be available in the future.

Golan and Globus made a lot of dogs during the late '70s and throughout the '80s, but this is not one of them. Sure, Desi Arnaz, Jr. is B-level at best, but he does the job as Leading Man in this movie in a movie that's really a light send-up and huge love note to classic horror movies.

I remember seeing this movie on video and on HBO when I was a kid, and I wish they could've gotten a better quality print of the movie for streaming. This print here is darker than dark. That's my only problem with the whole thing as presented here on Amazon. I had a copy of it on VHS, one I bought from a video store back in the mid-90s, but of course my VCR died several years ago, and before that the tape wore out from all the viewings.

The most unfortunate aspect of this film is that Price, always a commanding presence even in schlocky B-movies like this, is not driving the picture.  That duty falls to Desi Arnaz Jr, who, as usual, provides an adequate, but customarily stilted and vanilla performance.  They should have simply got these four great Gothic stars together and filmed them reminiscing about their history together.  Might have provided a much more entertaining evening.

The color is spot on, and the movie plays so unlike any review that I have read.

Yes, I have refrained from watching the film previously. I did not feel that watching horrible video transfers could in any way do justice to the film (and I think that those bad transfers are the reasons for the formerly weak reviews). All of the 4 horror masters have far larger roles than the reviews imply, and Peter Cushing gives an incredibly different performance than I have ever seen from this great actor  If you have ever seen a film with this man (even if only as Darth Vader's boss, the Commander of the Death Star in the original ""Star Wars""), then you should watch this film to see how wide a range he had as an actor.

It has every clich found in classic horror movies. Black cats, lightning storms, shadows by candlelight, and hidden passages with a skull overhead. The things that set this apart from others is the legendary actors and that quirky british touch that makes a horror movie slightly amusing. I find the multiple plot twists original and fun.

Nothing is going to jump out at you.

1988748,5,B0001CLEFM,"in my biased opinion ANY film starring Vincent Price is worthy of 5 stars, and throw in such masters of the genre as  Lee, Cushing, and the grand Carradine, and you have a supreme entry. However, biases aside, this is a wonderful story making use of classic story elements that wouldn't work without these stars. The elements are cliche, yes, but that's kind of the point... which is why with what can be considered cliche horror stars, it makes it rise head and shoulders above many others. My only major complaint is that the print is SO DARK, it's difficult to make things out at times. Couple this with the low lighting that was so trendy in the 70's, and it becomes downright murky. But that is the print, not the story.

Watch this, it is great fun with an Agatha Christie type of setting... the big old classic house, uplighting, the hidden scandal, the young couple... and a twist you think you've figured out but likely haven't.",1350864000,,937,4.571428571428571
1988749,1,B0001CLEFM,"HOUSE OF THE LONG SHADOWS...yecch! Not gruesome, just...boring! Perhaps the worst movie ever made. Most of it takes place in the dark with hardly anything visible. What one CAN see isn't worth looking at. A real shame that Vincent Price, Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing and John Carradine were wasted in this mess. Not a particularly fitting epitaph for any of them (though they all went on to make many more movies after this). It's based (probably rather loosely) on an Earl Derr Biggs novel, SEVEN KEYS TO BALDPATE (he of Charlie Chan fame). I tracked down the book and downloaded it to my reader so I can see if it's a miserable as the movie. It was also filmed, directed by and starring, of all people, George M. Cohan, with Hedda Hopper appearing under her real name, Elda Furry! At any rate, this is one DVD I'll never watch again!

In case you're dying to know the plot, an American author (Desi Arnaz, Jr.) is in England to promote his latest potboiler. His agent suggests that he should write a different style of book, since his are getting stale. They make a bet that he can (or can't) turn out a book in one weekend. The agent arranges for a deserted Welsh manor where he won't be disturbed. The manor has one of those Welsh names with all consonants. The agent says he thinks it's pronounced ""Baldpate."" The author packs up a rented car and off he goes. From that point on, it's a stormy night; there's no electricity in the house; it's supposedly deserted but it's not, since there's a caretaker and his daughter in residence. (The caretaker is John Carradine; the daughter is Sheila Keith, whoever she is.) People keep turning up. It unfolds that the ""caretaker"" and everyone else are part of the family that owned the estate but abandoned it in 1938...except for a mad brother who supposedly raped and murdered a townie and has been locked in a room in one of the towers...only when they open the room, he's not there. It goes on and on, with the yawns and the ""Oh, come on!"" getting more and more frequent, with everyone dead except the author and his love interest, who is the agent's secretary. It eventually ends (thank goodness!) in a final ""surprise ending,"" which I won't go into here, in case anyone really wants to see it. It's an amazingly bad movie! Desi Arnaz, Jr., should have stayed with Dino, Desi and Billy, and everyone else should have just stayed away...including me.",1337040000,,2402,4.599067599067599

We ""assumed"" that she had watched the movie before she called.
The following week she called after watching the movie.  She said that it was so dark that the only thing that she could see on screen was when someone lit a candle...and even then the flame wasn't very bright.  The dialog came thru perfectly, and she appreciated that.  I told her that it could be sent back, but she decided to keep it since we didn't know if we would ever be able to find another copy.

It was a little pricey, so I waited to make my purchase. It was a couple of months later that I checked the price again and a seller did have one that I felt was in the right price range. I hesitated no longer and quickly made my purchase. Upon receiving my DVD, I watched it almost immediately. It did not disappoint. Although I initally only remembered Vincent Price, it was not because the performances from Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee were anything less than excellent.

1988777,2,B0001CLEFM,"I purchased this dvd title back in may this year but have only just watched it. After reading all the reviews here I was dreading putting it on the dvd player. I have other dvdr's from the MGM range that are good quality but are prone to skipping and freeze framing and jumping what seems to be any part of the dvd movie.
Well I still use an old Sony 29"" analogue digital comb filter/nicam tv (can't see the model no) and i played the dvd back on a sony ns900v sacd/dvd player (old yes i know).
This in my choice after trying to watch the Doris Day Show dvd box set on a new flat lcd tv which was all blocky and horrible.
This tv I have had since about 94 and when I watched the Doris Day show the picture was so good-no horrible blocking or tiny sound a bit like an old broadcast in analogue.
This was the same experience i had with House Of Long Shadows dvd title. The picture is very dark almost all the way through almost impossible to see and there is an orange tone to the film- tinkering with the hew button on the tv was a little better but as a previous reviewer has said this print is not from the original camera negative. You would have to watch it with no other light in the room. As I watched this title on old analogue equipment I obviously didn't get the problems others get from using these horrible lcd tv's. The dvd didn't jump or skip either.
I gave the title two stars because of the poor quality of the dvd-at a high price I think MGM should have done a far better print instead of a print that you get buying a dvd for a couple of quid.
So this is a reason I have not yet gone seriously for a lcd tv because I just don't have any faith in them.
My experience of the film apart from it being very dark was fine though-the flash of white at the begining as one reviewer said is very annoying (forgot what it said).I found the sound ok because the tv I used has a good speaker system built in.

All in all you would have to be a real fan of these films to buy this dvd title. I think it is one of Pete Walkers best though. I hope this review is of some use to someone.i am going for Rod Steigers The Sergent next.

Alas, the print used has not been improved from a poor video of old; the particular disappointment is that many scenes play in virtual darkness with only the sound to inform you that the disc is still playing. I know that when produced MGM were on their last legs, but given the price this no excuse for so poor a print.

The MGM DVD is not in the widescreen, letterboxed format but the truncated full-screen version.  On top of that the MGM print of this film is extremely dark for much of the movie making it nearly unwatchable.

It is painfully obvious that MGM was using a dark 16MM print as their source for the DVD.

What a shame because ""House Of The Long Shadows"" is based on the classic mystery novel by Charlie Chan creator Earl Derr Biggers, ""Seven Keys To Baldpate"".  It even has co-stars Desi Arnaz Jr. and one of Benny Hill's former angels, Louise English giving good performances in this handsomely-produced British made mystery film.

I was drawn to it and in spite of being in the theater to see a 3D re-release of Vincent Price's House of Wax, the obvious horror contained in House of Long Shadows was too much for my 13 year old psyche...I didn't even dare ask if we could see it.

Through the years my thoughts have gone back to that poster and what the movie must have been. Then I ran across this disc on Amazon and ordered it immediately.

Now that I have had a chance to see it I realize that there was nothing to have truly been afraid of but at the time I had seen very few movies and who knows what nightmares may have been born had I seen it. As for the film itself, it is a passable ""old dark house"" tale with enough of a knowing wink to the conventions of such a story that it does indeed play out as something of a satire...but one so very dry that it risks being viewed as a serious attempt at a gothic tale.

Did the movie live up to my twenty-seven years of anticipation...not really. But then it would have been hard for any film to do so. In truth, it didn't let me down either. It was fun to see the cast all together in one movie and while much of it was somewhat predictable...aren't most movies of this type?

1988799,1,B0001CLEFM,"I was so happy to be able to order this film, I am a great fan of Price, Lee, Cushing, and Carradine. I give the movie 4 stars, which I have seen many years ago.  The quality of the DVD however is 1 star.
The movie was so dark that I couldn't see a thing for almost the first half of the movie. The only time I actually saw anything is when they were in a room with candles all around, or when he put the candle right up to his face.  I couldn't see Desi Arnez Jr. moving about at all, it's as if I had my eyes closed, nothing was visible to give you a idea of what was going on. I've seen this film many years ago and although the house was dark you could see the staircase and Desi moving around. I will never buy another MGM dvd-r product again. I am returning the DVD to Amazon. I have been buying movies from Amazon for years, and never returned a movie for a Refund, This is a First for me. Do not buy this DVD. The price for this Movie is outragous! It belongs in the $1 bin at the dollar store and that would be still overpaying. I have never been this upset with a movie I pruchased. Listen to all the other 1 star reviews, They are right on!!",1272672000,,1152,3.8978723404255318

Anyone buying this doesnt need a review of the film itself, your going to know what your buying !
But the quality is abysmal , so dark in places you can see absolutely nothing !!
Terrible .
MGM hang your head in shame for this rip off !",1272672000,,245,3.92
1988801,1,B0001CLEFM,"What were they thinking? Dark,grainy,washed out and completely unwatchable. What a disappointment! There's even a flash frame of a white slate that says ""MTI missing frame"" or something like that. Clearly where this ""film"" had been repaired. It's like they found a Beta rental from 1980 and dubbed it to DVD. DO NOT BUY THIS!",1272585600,,325,4.927272727272728
1988802,1,B0001CLEFM,"It's hard to believe that MGM had the gall to release this as a DVD-R burn-on-demand release for $20; the quality of the transfer (which looks to be cropped 1:1.33) is truly appalling with many scenes so dark as to make it impossible to see what was going on. Also the copy I had froze now and again on some players. A shamefully poor release from a major studio, resembling a second generation video bootleg.",1272412800,,409,4.466666666666667
1988803,1,B0001CLEFM,"What can I say that hasn't been said here already? This print is so dark with colors over saturated, it resembles the $1 DVD's you find in the supermarket. It's that bad. I just can't believe they had the nerve not to remaster or at least get a better print of this movie. To make matters worse, the disc retails for 17 or 19.99. What a rip off! Night scenes totally oblitirate any moving images. Is Dezi Arnaz Jr. wearing a black cap througout the movie, or is that his hair? You make the call. T.C.",1272412800,,500,4.21875
1988804,1,B0001CLEFM,"First, lets get this out of the way: my rating is for the DVD release, not the film itself which would be an easy 4 star in my book.

As for this realse, MGM are either delusional or smoking something to think this is an acceptable release! The print is so muddy and dark that my VHS copy looks like a Blu-Ray in comparison! I'm not kidding, I put them both on and went from room to room comparing image quality. Where the DVD has faded colours and dingy shadows, the VHS was bright and crisp and vibrant. When John Carradine stalks out of the dark for the first time, on this DVD all you can see is a hand holding a candle and half of his face - on the VHS you can not only see him, but also the hall he's emerging from.

There's no menu screen for this one: it just starts right up just like a VHS and there is no scene selection (of course not, with no menu to make selections from). Worse, there are errors in the print itself. In the above mentioned sceen with John Carradine, there is a quick white blip - an editing frame! The quality of the DVD is even more suspect given that it played on only two of three machines in my apartment - the cheap player and the Xbox 360 both played it, but my expensive Sony DVD recorder never finished trying to load it whenever it was put in the tray.

I've been waiting eagerly for a DVD release of this movie and was quite thrilled when I saw MGM was releasing it, given their good quality in the past. Experience with the Warner Brothers archive collection, which have all been quite nice if no frills releases, also made me very eager for this release. What I got, instead, was a slap in the face and the sound of some mogul laughing his way to the bank. This would be an unacceptable DVD if it was bought from a shady character at a flea market, for a major studio to slop something like this onto the market is outrageous.

Pick this one up only if you need a coaster.",1272326400,,1916,4.128686327077748
1988805,2,B0001CLEFM,"This review focuses strictly on the quality of the video image, which is quite mediocre. The image is presented in what appears to be an open-matted 1:33 aspect ratio, so there is extra information at the top and bottom of the screen compared to what should be visible in a 1:85 widescreen presentation. If you have a widescreen TV, you can zoom in to correct the aspect ratio you see, but that makes the image less crisp. Not that the image is crisp if you don't zoom in. Another problem is use of what appears to be either a TV video master, or a 2nd or 3rd generation film master. The was definately not mastered from the camera negative. Finally, the image is somewhat dark and a bit orange looking. This is the only MGM DVD-R product I purchased, and all I can say is that it is a huge step down from the generally very good image quality of the Warner Archive and Universal DVD-R products. MGM really needs to step up their game if they want to compete in this space. Disappointing, and recommended only for fans of the movie who ""need to own this"" regardless of quality.",1271980800,,1077,4.39
1988806,1,B0001CLEFM,"This DVD-R freeze frames during playback. Currently, all MGM DVD-Rs are being investigated for defects by Amazon.com. Hopefully, they will resolve this problem soon.",1271894400,,165,5.916666666666667
1988807,4,B0001CLEFM,"I never thought i would see the day when HOUSE OF THE LONG SHADOWS would ever look this good. After suffering through various abysmal VHS, DVD, and Instant Video transfers, SHADOWS is reborn in this new Blu-Ray transfer. It even looks better than when I saw it in the theaters back in the 1980s. Of course drive-in prints aren't noted for their pristine quality but it was not bad which is why the cheap overly dark earlier incarnations were so appalling. Now that is no longer an issue and fans and soon-to-be-fans alike can enjoy this film for generations to come.

Is it a great movie? Hardly, but it is an old school horror fan's dream come true as if gives you the opportunity to see a once-in-a-lifetime cast of legendary horror greats together in one movie. Vincent Price, Christopher Lee, Peter Cushing, and John Carradine hold court in this old dark house mystery. The only one missing is Elsa Lanchester (BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN for those who don;t know) who was to have been Carradine's wife but had to bow out due to ill health and was replaced by Pete Walker regular Sheila Keith who plays Carradine's daughter.

The movie has its origins in a turn of the 20th century stage play called SEVEN KEYS TO BALDPATE which was written by Earl Derr Biggers of Charlie Chan fame and adapted by none other than Broadway legend George M. Cohan. It had been filmed at least three times before this but never with so distinguished a cast. They are the reason for the film's existence but it's very curious to see it helmed by Pete Walker whose earlier horror films were brutal and intense while it was written by Michael Armstrong whose MARK OF THE DEVIL was marketed in theaters with vomit bags.

The story concerns a bet between a writer and a publisher that he cannot stay in an uninhabited house and produce a manuscript in 24 hours. Of course the house isn't uninhabited as members of the very bizarre Grisbane family keep turning up and it turns out there's a homicidal maniac under lock and key upstairs. I won't spoil it for those of you who have never seen it but if you know the old dark house genre than you know the drill. The film, like the original play, comes with an ending that has to be seen to be believed but it's all part of the fun.

As the writer, Desi Arnaz Jr. is no revelation but he fits into the proceedings rather nicely. Old pro Richard Todd provides some fun as the publisher and the Brit TV actress Julie Peasgood gives us more than what is required of her. SHADOWS was way outdated when it was made and got lost among the more explicit material that had come to define the horror film but Golan-Globus of The Cannon Group deserve praise for giving these old favorites one last hurrah and Kino Lorber deserves praise for a quality transfer at last!",1271808000,,2778,4.505952380952381
1988808,5,B0001CLEFM,"Well this is a great movie, Price, Cushing and Lee, and don't forget John Carradine.

As for Desi Arnaz dying just after this movie - yes, that's quite correct, but, Desi Arnaz had no connection with this film at all.  It was Desi Arnaz JUNIOR who is the juvenile lead and he is still very much with us.",1269475200,,303,4.206896551724138
1988809,4,B0001CLEFM,"How many of you know George M. Cohan?  Yankee Doodle Dandy?  I am not surprised if you don't.  He was one of America's great stage  artists of the early 1900's.  The reason I mention him is that he wrote the original play that this movie is based on, 7 Keys to Ballpate. Which is a classic play and maybe the first mystery to have a twist at the end.  As a matter of fact, this movie has three different endings.  I have used this movie with students to show manipulation by a writer or director .

It is filled with classic horror movie actors of the 50's 60's, Lee, Cushing, Price all together.  The acting....well over the top or hammy would describe it and it is supposed to be that  way.  Dezi Arnez  really does a nice job. Oh I forgot Richard Todd.  Todd played in many British war movies, The Dam Busters and was great in The Longest Day

The whole movie is one stero typical film of every horror movie gimmick.  That too is on purpose.  The dry humor is spot on and very funny.

This not great movie and maybe not even that good of one, but it is a "" hoot!""  It is well woth seeing and it has a smile or two in it.

I very seriously doubt if you can firgure out the endings?  Maybe one of them or two, but not all three.",1269388800,,1229,4.041666666666667
1988810,5,B0001CLEFM,"This is a great movie to have, but I fear one would be quite disappointed if one had to pay over $20 for it!  It is, in truth, not that great, but like the other reviewers I find this to be a film dear to my heart, and take it out every few years to watch.  It actually does keep one guessing (if you wait a LOT of years between viewings, you may actually forget the twists and turns like I did!), but it is very contrived.  I'll just come out and say it: without the 4 Gentlemen of Horror, nobody would ever mention this movie!  But those Gentlemen ARE in here, and their performances are delicious and characteristic (though Dear Peter plays a bit of a different role with a rather peculiar ""accent""; I'll say no more so as not to spoil it).  Because of these Titans of Terror, this is essential.  It isn't a terrible, insulting, or even cheapo movie, it is just a bland blank canvas for these masters to bring to life.  There are some kind've cool deaths/murders (in a very made-for-TV-movie kind've way, even though this was theatrically released), a very successful ""Old Dark House"" genre atmosphere, and a mysterious yet easy-to-follow plot.  All Red Herrings (I believe) are explained.  When you think about all the abominable, outright crap that is dug up and re-released on dvd and bluray, one wonders how long it'll be until someone unearths this minorly classic film for a modern release?  This is a warm visit with dear, old f(r)iends that is highly recommended for fans of nostalgic, true, old-time Horror (though this isn't even really a Horror film)...all others avoid!",1267142400,,1584,4.604982206405694

This is not deep, very frightening, or even all that well written.  But it is so much fun to watch!  It is basically a spoof on its own old horror show genre!  My sister and I pull this one out every couple of years, toss our husbands out the door, pop some popcorn, and sit back to enjoy it again (preferably when there is a storm raging outside to set the mood).  Get it and have fun!",1264550400,,551,3.9908256880733943
1988812,5,B0001CLEFM,"not all is what it seems in this 1983 film teaming four horror legends together. Vincent Price and Christopher Lee are the two legends with the most speaking time but Peter Cushing isn't to be forgotten neither despite his lack of speaking lines. John Carradine doesn't necessarily do much, other than scold and hollar at people from his chair. most of the action centers around the house that a writer stays in for ""mood"" and atmosphere trying to write a horror story. Desi Arnaz, Jr. plays the writer who has a cynical viewpoint of his profession and horror in general. his bickerings with Price's character over true horror versus Hollywood spookiness is STILL a heated discussion among horror fans to this day. as Arnaz and his female partner embark on this house, they learn of it's history. the horror icons, though having little airtime together, each have signifigant airtime separately through their encounters with Arnaz. soon, murders start to take place and a story is revealed about a deep secret hidden in the family's history. this film is a one-joke story and i'm not going to spoil the ending. the VHS cover opens up like a book and the cast-list is shown. the cover art is wonderful with each horror icon holding up a weapon in a family portrait of sorts: Price has a rope, Carradine has a daggger, Lee has an ax, and Cushing has a knife. on the back of the cover there is a picture of Arnaz writing by candle light and next to that is a picture of all four horror legends in an obvious publicity shot. the family name in this film is Grisbane. the movie is based on ""Seven Keys to Baldpate"". ""House of the Long Shadows"" is a must-have because it's the ONLY film that has these four actors in it together. whether or not the movie is good or bad isn't important since that can be debated anytime {i like the movie} but from a historical perspective this film is essential for the fans of the four leading men and horror fans in general. the running time is 102 minutes. the copyright year is 1982, which is correct. it didn't hit the theatres until 1983. Christopher Lee's scenes are outrageous in their cartoonish violence! also, each of the icons bring their ""style"" to the film: Carradine's role is hollow and cruel, Price is suave yet campy, Lee is a sophisticate surrounded by insanity, and Cushing is lovable but at times self-destructive. this is a wonderful movie.",1079222400,,2390,4.639150943396227

Peter Cushing, Vincent Price, and Christopher Lee.  I am also disappointed that I paid $12.90 plus $3.99 shipping for a DVD that was not able to view because the images were so dark.

HD is here to stay folks, so why not get the best available Edition? Yep.
The storyline is okay. It centers around a BET an author has to write a novel in 24 Hrs. in a House that was not supposed to be lived in for quite sometime. It is one of those movies where you have to get it for the actors involved. I have quite a library of the actors in it, so this was a ""no brainer"" to add. Find a good deal before purchasing. I did.
