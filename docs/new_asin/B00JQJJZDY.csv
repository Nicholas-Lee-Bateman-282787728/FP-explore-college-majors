8653315,4,B00JQJJZDY,"A very well done documentary, parts of it re-enacted, focusing on the search and capture of the bombers. I was struck by how hard it was to simply survey all of the various images -- one researcher says she saw the explosions so many times that she cannot ""not see"" them in her imagination years later.

I would give this film five stars except I found a bit too much focus on some of the victims and would have liked to see more focus on the law enforcement people working on the case.

But, well worth watching.

It's an enthralling account of the fateful days of the bombing and search for the two bombers. It captures the emotions of those directly affected very well & makes you remember that this is not just a story of the hunt, but those whose lives were forever changed.",1499644800,,348,4.5396825396825395

8653318,3,B00JQJJZDY,"This horrible event was big news for some days. The media covered it and I was aware of at least the more pressing points. This documentary gives the viewer a blow by blow account of incident and brings the details into much greater focus.

Here's the scoop. It's the famed Boston Marathon. Tens of thousands line the street to cheer on the runners. Near the finish line two bombs go off in quick succession. A few people are killed and many are injured. Officials jump into action and begin to form an action plan incorporating the FBI and any other agency they feel will help the cause.

This is generally quite good. It gives the viewer a good sense of all the details involved and how some of it comes down to mind-numbingly boring work, like looking at hours upon hours of video feeds. But it all does begin to take shape. One thing that surprised me (and it should not have) was that those involved in the hunt to keep in the backs of their minds that this might not have been an isolated incident. It might only have been an opening salvo for more to come. But all the officials interviewed gave their piece of the story and voiced their concerns about the various decisions made.

On the downside there were a couple of really cheap shots. Setting the viewer up for a bad ending cliff hanger then letting them off the hook with good news. This seems to have been produced for commercial TV so the tightening and loosening of the screws were structured around commercial breaks. I suppose if that's the burden you must shoulder, it is what it is. But I don't like it. It's the tale wagging the dog. That might be fine for sitcoms but this is a more serious endeavor and deserves better.

This is a bit better than the 3 stars I gave it. Is does contain some good information. I just wish the producers would have targeted an audience that didn't require the cheap theatrics.",1430956800,4,1881,4.443478260869565

2013~ this starts with the human angle of the victims of the bombing including a man and wife and even a couple dating. All at the finish line of the Boston Marathon when the series of TWO bombs go off.... Their injury's and recovery are shown. Then the police/FBI start the search~ the HIGH TECH part is very interesting how the search using top computer software and analysts to look for clues from Videos from buildings, cell phone and tv. How thousands of photos and video were submitted by the public.  As they piece the hunt to focus on two men...dubbed WHITE hat and BLACK hat because of the clothing they wore. They focus on a deliberate series of two bombs and terrorists. As the police also add in a CAR JACKING....they look for a BLACK SUV and end up with bombs being tossed at police and one of the two suspects being killed by gunfire and his partner running over him in the SUV in his escape. The city is pretty much on lock down when the first suspect dies and his finger prints ID him as a RUSSIAN. This leads the trail to his brother the MISSING and on the run suspect. When a man goes to check in a LOOSE boat cover he spots BLOOD in his boat and the POLICE, FBI and SWAT teams merge to ""get the final suspect."" USING the latest high tech they are able to capture him alive. This is very good. Told in docu drama style. Some parts are portrayed by actors. BASED on the real events that lasted about 103 hours to final arrest. The HIGH tech computer and facial recognition softwear in actual use was fascinating.",1428624000,4,1579,4.349152542372881

8653321,4,B00JQJJZDY,"On the one year anniversary of the Boston Bombing, National Geographic, has given us a documentary of the events.  For the most part, 'Inside the Hunt for the Boston Bombers' gives us a detailed examination of how the killers were tracked down in less than five days. For those of us who live near Boston, this was an event never to be forgotten.

The documentary combines real footage, and dramatizations  based on witness testimonies, interviews with FBI and Boston police. Inside the Hunt for the Boston Bombers showed us that everyone has a camera.  And, as we see up close, it was only because so many people were filming the event that the police were able to identify the suspects. We watch as the FBI combs through thousands of photos, security footage,and the moment one of them discovers one of the bombers leaving his backpack in front of Marathon Sports.  It was the media, who moved events along at some points. One Television station told the FBI,  they had a picture of the terrorists and were going to show it. This forced the police to release pictures, once the last terrorist was found, the news media had hijacked the helicopter camera feed, and the FBI made the decision to cut the feed. in the final chase. The dramatizations were riveting, hearing from those involved, those who were wounded, and the police and FBI. It is a superb rendition, and well played.

Recommended. prisrob 01-07-15",1420588800,3,1413,4.766393442622951
8653322,5,B00JQJJZDY,This documentary is an outstanding look at the Boston marathon bombing and the investigation into who was responsible. The stories of victims and their families are heartbreaking. One police officer was running in the marathon. The one mistake the bombers made was underestimating the BPD and FBI. This gives a great insight into the investigation and the impact the bombing had on them. I definitely recommend this documentary.,1411430400,3,428,5.3088235294117645
