The original 36 episodes of the 1982 series:
Super Dimension Fortress Macross.
I like Neon Genesis Evangelion,and highly recommend that series as well.but it takes a back seat to this.
Any and all Anime fans absolutely must have this series!!!
it's going to be re-released by ADV. (get it!!!!)
The Animego release is no longer available.
This is to anime as the original star wars is to sci-fi.
Unfortunately,the later series of macross were quite lame.
Macross plus looks great,but the story is weak.
Macross seven and dynamite seven is horrible and quite childish even.the animation is better,but the story is stupid.and the characters are annoying.
after the original 36 episodes of Macross,everything else is just fluff!
Even the recently released Macross Zero.it looks fantastic!!but the story is very disapointing. I thought it was a prequel to the original series,but it strayed away from it from the beginning,and became a magic and special powers kinda anime.(typical).was waiting for a role playing card game to happen during this one! LOL
they bombed on zero!!
stick with the original MASTERPIECE!!
5 stars,absolute perfection.
Fantastic story,almost seems like it could actually be a probable reality. And not an impossible unrealistic story.

the original Macross series and yes...Neon Genesis Evangelion,are the two greatest anime series of all time. And must be had by followers of anime.

Weta workshop (creators of the lord of the rings trilogy) is currently in pre-production mode on a live action movie for Neon Genesis Evangelion!!!)

But in reality this original series has much more depth and story.  The biggest difference I've noticed is the narration.  The orginal Macross in Japanese uses less narration and also a woman's voice.  The story and script is definitely better written in this version.  In SDF Macross, Lynn Minmei truly is the key character.  Her voice (Mari Iijima) is an actual singer in Japan.  Which makes the Macross songs beautiful to listen to.  If you're into JPop then you'll know what I mean.

If you're a Robotech fan, you may not like Hikaru Ichijyo as the main character.  And Rory Focker, Misa Hayase as Roy Fokker and Lisa Hayes.  But once you start this series, you'll really enjoy it more.  Although the Macross continium with Macross Plus, Macross 7, and Macross Zero makes this a must start.",1101513600,4,915,4.7215189873417724
