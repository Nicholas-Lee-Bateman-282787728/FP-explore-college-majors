8633034,5,B00HIJN13O,This is not a comment on the movie which I enjoyed very much.  The colors on the Blu-ray are better than the HD version on youtube.  This is easily noticed on Ali's shirt at the roadside eatery as well as looking at Pawan Kalyan's shirt and Samantha's sari.  Comparing the two version shows the quality of the Blu-ray.,1494547200,,318,4.448275862068965
