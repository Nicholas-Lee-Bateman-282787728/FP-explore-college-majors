2385918,5,B000ADWCV2,"Having just watched this unbelievably powerful documentary, I am still shaken, and suspect I will be for days.  The footage is simply incredible.  No other film about WWII, fictional or non-fictional, captures the horror of the concentration camps as simply and powerfully as this.

It is the most disturbing, horrifying, and powerful pieces of film I have ever seen.",1141689600,167,367,5.186440677966102
2385936,5,B000ADWCV2,Really powerful and raw. This isn't an overly edited documentary but is above and beyond in a different way. The video is extremely moving although a lot more graphic than what you might see on PBS today. I plan on showing this to my son that he might understand why the past should not repeat itself. This documentary should be watched in it's entirety by adults before showing to kids.,1453852800,,387,4.542857142857143

2385961,5,B000ADWCV2,"To get rid of typhus, one must first get rid of lice and that is what they had to do in camps so contaminated patients were put through a DDT dust laundry by the Allied Forces. That was for the lucky few alive ones who were not too weak to eat since many died from hunger or were gassed or were burned in ovens at rate of 30,000 and more in every single camp. Germans had over 300 of these camps. There are many disturbing scenes in this documentary since after all it is about dead people, people who are down to their bones before dropping dead where ever they happen to be in any camp.  Not a DVD to own but certainly to watch since it shows humanity at its one of lowest points less than a century ago where German specie proved how low one can get from 1923 to 1945, only in a period of twelve years. It really can be disturbing watching this documentary since the Germans seem so remote from humanity but unfortunately this is the reality, the disturbing part of human specie and regardless of what you are told, you will never believe unless you get to witness these scenes. This has to be seen to be believed due to the vast amount of dead bodies everywhere that can be seen. Speechless is understatement of the century for this documentary. Unbelievable, shocking and disturbing to say the least.",1429315200,,1305,4.348360655737705

2385963,5,B000ADWCV2,"This is a PBS Home Video in a DVD, which is an outstanding production.  I was an Officer is the USAF, and the Nuremberg Code of 1947 has been a special interest because of the matter of social eugenics with a doctrine of attrition (that is the ""Final Solution"" which the French coined the term
""Genocide"" for the Post World War II investigations regarding the Nuremberg trials.  I have seen several documentaries.  Frontline stands out among them for its emphasis on 300 concentration camps and the absurdity German populations did not know about them; they chose not to know.
In addition, the Frontline program revealed Nazi SS Einsatzgruppen and Nazi SS Guards could not hide behind the explanation that they were just following orders.  Some of the atrocities were addressed by the manner in which the Allies liberated the concentration camps and helped the confined populations.  The compassion and extra care they provided to women - and especially the children who were still alive - were outstanding.
One of the most atrocious incidents revealed was how the Nazi SS executioners ran out of Zyxlon B gas and threw children alive into the fire of
the crematory furnaces?!  Since I have received this DVD, I have shown it to families and individuals who doubted the barbaric savagery and
exterminations of Jews and political prisoners.  Not only Jews, but also political prisoners, clergy, the religious and others considered contrary to the Third Reich were murdered in those camps also.  The Frontline DVD has re-affirmed my belief that Jesus Christ was a Jew.  When a Jew is attacked
I am attacked.  When a Jew is murdered, that I am the subject of an attempted murder.  The Frontline DVD affirms the standard what happened shall not be forgotten and there must never be another Holocaust!",1425513600,11,1796,4.9335548172757475

Yes, we all know what occurred at those Camps. But even your worst nightmares cannot conceive what you will see if you watch this. The atrocities were beyond horrific. I wanted to personally tie these Nazi's to a tree and leave them there.  I will never forget what I saw in the torture, starvation, and degradation of these innocent human beings. I wanted to turn it off half way through, but I forced myself to watch it til the end. My hope is that when I'm gone from this world, others will watch. Lest we never forget!",1416182400,10,694,4.544

Watch it, please, and look carefully at the faces of your ancestors, brothers and sisters in humanity.  Fascism can have many guises.

I saw this as a child when it was first released on Frontline.  20 years later I still remembered the horror that this documentary showed.  I own it now and have watched it dozens of times.  It still tears my heart out and makes me cry.  This one documentary shows mans inhumanity to man.  This one documentary makes real what time is erasing from our memories.  No one, no one could watch this and not understand how important it is to remember the holocaust; how important it is that we never, never allow this to happen again!",1392940800,,597,4.5233644859813085

I didn't preview it before showing it to my students...but it was the best accident I could have made. The class was so silent you could hear a pin drop. I have showed this every year since. The footage is so powerful. Yes, movies are powerful, but there is nothing like unedited, documentary footage to show the true reality of the Holocaust.

It is a must see for every teenager & adult, everywhere. I truly believe that.",1389398400,4,524,4.458333333333333
2385980,3,B000ADWCV2,"As with most documentaries of the holocaust, this film is laden with scenes of inhuman events.

2385981,4,B000ADWCV2,Most of the videos I've seen from the concentration camps are poor quality footage.  This is very clear (and sadly graphic) footage of the prisoners at the camp.

2385986,5,B000ADWCV2,"I had seen Memory of Camps a number of times before, but I wanted to own it.  This was a movie that was planned after WWII but was never fully finished.  This DVD takes you through that, but also gives the greatest expanse of what was the Nazi concerntration camp system.  Many people think there was only 1 or 2 camps - there were over 300!  This DVD does not cover them all but does show what the British found when they arrived at Begen Belsen, one of the worst and yet most representative camps.  Any understanding of WWII must include this footage, and this DVD presents it better than any other.",1364515200,3,601,4.330357142857143

2385989,1,B000ADWCV2,"The large number of ""fives"" was the deciding factor in my decision to buy this DVD, so now having done so, I feel compelled to add my dissenting vote.  The contents and presentation are, at best, hopelessly out of date.  Perhaps the most useful information I can offer prospective purchasers is a summary of what they will actually see and hear if they buy this DVD.  The production opens with often-seen newsreel footage of a triumphant Adolf Hitler and rallying Nazis to set the stage for the spread of the Nazi concentration camp system.  Most of the remaining time (far too much, given the camp's importance) is devoted to the Allied liberation of Bergen Belsen.  We see several minutes of nothing besides captured SS burying naked, emaciated corpses in mass graves and Allied medical staff giving aid to weak and emaciated survivors.  The only ""break"" comes when Trevor Howard observes that the liberated prisoners relished the fresh water that the Allies were able to restore.  To illustrate this point, we are shown several remarkably well-nourished naked women showering in full frontal view from the waist up!  No mention is made of historically relevant facts, such as that this is the camp where Ann Frank spent her last days, or that the camp began its existence as a Wehrmacht POW camp and was only taken over in part by the SS well into the war.  After Bergen-Belsen, we move to Dachau.  Same routine:  A quick shot showing the location of the camp on a 1940's map, some aerial reconnaissance footage of the camp in 1945, followed by seemingly endless footage of emaciated prisoners and corpse disposal.  The narration includes the now-discredited claim that mass gassings happened at Dachau, but makes no mention of the massacre of SS guards by the enraged American liberators.  The treatment of the other camps is identical.  The Trevor Howard who narrates this is not the same Trevor Howard whose crisp voice authoritatively commanded the crew of the Bounty in 1965!  This Trevor Howard sounds weak and tired.  Who would want to own this DVD?  Good question indeed!  It should be compulsory viewing for unrepentant SS, if any remain living, and for those who still deny that the Holocaust happened.  For serious students of history, however, I recommend instead Auschwitz: Inside the Nazi State.",1361750400,13,2312,4.927648578811369

2386007,5,B000ADWCV2,"Every school, church, synagogue, and mosque ought to have a copy of this one hour film.  Every home ought to have access to it.  In it, the incomprehensible is revealed through narration and depiction.

As one of German descent, I thought I would feel shame as the grandchild of German immigrants.  Instead, I am ashamed of humanity's capacity for the worst kinds of astrocities.  This film graphically depicts the outcome of the work of the Nazi state; heaven only knows what these innocents experienced prior to their deaths.

The most shocking thing about this well-done documentary is that it shows that the impossible is indeed possible.  Let the viewer be warned of this film's strong lessons:  beware of the power of deception and self-deception.

Let the human race join in an everlasting chorus of: ""Never Again""",1325462400,13,821,4.977941176470588

2386009,5,B000ADWCV2,"One of the episodes of World at War is entitled Genocide, and just shows pictures with the most minimal of words.  Having seen other documenatries on the subject with more to say, it has continued to more powerful in its message as its so fundamental.  As is this documentary, which features a minimilist script and a message more powerful than any long winded speech can give.  I looked at these piled corpses, thinking that each of them had family and love and hopes and dreams and were cheated.  The commentary is very telling too, the comment about the SS guards no longer looking so pristine, especially.  Because there is so much horror, it's easy to shut it out as too much.  But its simple commentary brings across the shock and horror and disbelief in the troops who first came on these places.

What thest two documentaries share is being first genereation, no analysis, or revision, just viseral horror of the reality.

I have read Liberators, America's Witnesses to the Holocaust, by Michael Hirsch, which describes in the same sort of stilted tones, the reaction of the boots on the ground to finding these horrors.  Some of them are commonly known, but some not.  The barn in Gardelegen is described in that, along with the reaction of the US troops who came upon it, and yet having read so clearly of it its different to see a picture. The townspeople were forced to dig grave for and bury each of the murdered in the barn.

The closing words made me cry.  But we've had Cambodia and Rwanda and Bosnia and so many other smaller replays it makes me wonder if we as human beings really learn.  I will urge anyong who has only read of or seen heavily edited versions to see this and think on what human beings are capable of doing to one another.",1316390400,10,1758,4.542857142857143

2386011,5,B000ADWCV2,"I had seen several Dvds about the Nazi death/concentration camps, but the other programs did not prepare me for anything as graphic and disturbing as this.  It is not for the faint of heart.  I think it will be with me for a long time.

There are scenes of thousands upon thousands of emaciated dead bodies being heaved into open pits and the mass graves being covered over by bulldozers.  SS guards and German citizens were forced to do the dirty work, which was as it should have been.  On and on it goes, from death camp to death camp.  What I cannot imagine is how anyone who is sane could deny that the Nazis did this intentionally to the millions of Jews, Gypsies, homosexuals, communists, and others who were deemed inferior trash by the self-proclaimed ""master race.""  But already new generations say yeah, yeah.

In the 2000 election a man ran for the House of Representatives in my district, a man whose hobby was dressing up as an SS officer on weekends and participating in living history fun.  Fun?  I am ashamed to say that he received a thin majority in my county, although he was defeated by votes elsewhere.  It was just a ""hobby,"" some said in apologizing for his action.  They should see this Dvd.  Maybe it wouldn't make any difference to some, but perhaps a few would be touched by the horror of what the SS did.",1306540800,10,1333,4.481327800829876

How could other people let it go on a daily basis? Your mind may want to believe that such thing never happened or that it was impossible for something like this to take place even during a war as tragic as World War II that left numberless victims throughout the world. This is not a horror show, this is the very grim reality of what inhuman deeds can humanity do during its worst times. As disturbing as this footage is, this documentary should be viewed by everyone at least once in their lifetime to remind ourselves of what one human is capable of doing to another and hopefully, to prevent this from happening ever again.

History tends to repeat itself, unfortunately. Only by knowing and witnessing it as well as not forgetting what happened in the godforsaken places like Auschwitz and many other camps throughout Eastern Europe during 1933-1945 are we to have a brighter future.

We are the messengers of this generation, by passing this document and knowledge to our children and peers we can make sure that the millions of people haven't died their terrible deaths in vain.

You want to know where in the world this kind of thing is going on now, what you might be able to do to stop it.

You also wonder...if you had been a German in one of the surrounding towns...would you have also complied as thousands upon thousands were prisoned, starved and exterminated under your nose?  Would your heart for humanity have allowed you to speak and take action or would your basic animal instinct to survive have kept you quiet and looking the other way?

Truly some harsh self examination must take place.",1242345600,51,844,4.700680272108843
2386017,5,B000ADWCV2,"I watched this video almost 15 years ago and it still remains one of the most vivid films I have ever seen. The fact that it is a silent movie makes it even more impressionable. I don't think I said a word as I watched it all those years ago and it still left an unforgettable mark on my mind. I finally bought this today because there are a few people I know who need to see this film. I think it is a must see for everyone whether they want to or not. We must make sure the future never forgets what happened all those years ago and that true evil does exist and if you ignore it, it will not just go away.
In September, I will be traveling to Munich for Oktoberfest which will be great, but the whole reason I wanted to go to Germany was to see one of these places for myself. Dachau will be one stop along the way.",1242000000,33,818,3.933734939759036
2386018,4,B000ADWCV2,This film is explicitly showing the terrible circumstances in the concentration camps! Real pictures! Do not get fooled by Alfred Hitchcoock's participating.,1239580800,6,157,6.181818181818182
2386019,5,B000ADWCV2,"This shows the end result of the horrors that took place during the Holocaust. The real horrors were never filmed and quite frankly no one would want to watch someone being tortured.

This film, although being extremely graphic, can never convey the true demonic horrors that took place there. You see thousands of corpses dragged, carried etc into large pits for burial after the camps were liberated. The film explains that 30,000 corpses were there, you see piles and piles of them but now lets not forget that over 11,000,000 died in the Nazi concentration camps.
How can we even come close to understanding what took place there but this film is shocking enough to make you sick. The question: ""How can one human treat another in such a horrible way?"" keeps popping into your head when you are watching this.

I highly recommend this DVD and would give it more stars if I could.
This should be shown in schools and people should be taught to love one another, no matter who you are or where you're from. Let the deaths of these poor souls have some meaning in that we learn something from it.

On another note:
I was pleasantly surprised that the quality of the DVD was top-notch!
Too many holocaust DVDs that I have seen are encoded poorly and the film transfers look bad as well. The 'Memory of the Camps' DVD seems as if it's had the film transferred from the original film.

Highly recommend it, show your children, they will never forget the images and will understand what war can bring to mankind.",1236124800,40,1509,4.598513011152416
2386020,5,B000ADWCV2,"When I first started teaching history... pre- Schindler's List; it was astounding how many of my high school students had never heard of the holocaust. Today even after the building of a Holocaust museum and many films this is still the most powerful one. The only complaints I ever had about the quality and interest developed was that many students disliked the narrator's droning voice. This is a British film, taken of the liberation of Bergan Belsen, but it also uses films that the Nazis took in documenting their camps.

It does good to explain to anyone what they will see, but also remind then of what they cannot smell, remind them of what they will see of the nearby townspeople who were made to walk through the camps that they denied they knew nothing of what was happening in when the stench could be smelled for a great distance. Remind and remember that these bodies are people, mothers, fathers, children, grandparents - they look like wax shrunken statues... they are not

This was the only documentary that I found that showed the bulldozing of bodies by the Nazis into the trenches, believe me that wakes up even a jaded teenager.  As years have gone by I have noticed an aloofness, a dispassion to the violence students see in videos and films, after all look at what they have in their average game cube - Memory of the Camps has been the one film and then tape and now DVD that I pull out in the spring WWII unit that leaves my students talking and even telling their parents that they must get this and see.",1227398400,17,1531,4.5398550724637685

2386022,5,B000ADWCV2,"This shocking film was broadcast in the U.K. as ""A Painful Reminder"" in 1985-forty years after WW2; I never forgot how disturbing those images were.
Available now again on DVD it really is a must see, a really chilling experience for those who want to see for themselves a terrible and dark chapter of history.
In some scenes at Bergen-Belsen there are carefully filmed scenes of the German female so called ""SS"" guards being put to work. Over 30,000 corpses lay strewn on the ground when the British liberated this place of hell on earth. For fourteen days these inhuman specimens were made to clear the ground of these poor pathetic 'prisoners' into several mass graves.
Deeply upsetting 100% original war footage of SEVERAL camps are included here, not recommended for those easily perturbed, and, viewer discretion certainly required.",1200096000,117,838,5.0359712230215825

I am proud that some of them survived, if the people telling these story's would not have survived no one would know the truth. I would like to see a DVD of the people today in Germany and what they really think of the Holocaust.  I wonder if they are sorry this happened.",1162512000,6,438,4.240963855421687

This project is without doubt the single most graphic and convincing evidence I have ever experienced for my sense that we all need to take responsibility for ensuring our voice is ALWAYS heard.

This video has enabled me to have conversations with my teenage children, and their friends, that I hope will ensure their generation is a little better equipped to deal with the awesome challenges that await them.

But the video, watch all of it if you can, weep, rage and strengthen your resolve to do what is possible within your power to promote a legacy of - Never Again - for the countless people who were blameless victims of the worst evil humanity has ever had to confront.

I strongly advise that parents review the video personally if they have children 15-16 years or younger prior to allowing them (or not) to view it.",1154304000,167,979,4.609195402298851
2386025,5,B000ADWCV2,"As a college professor I use this film in undergraduate and graduate Multiculturalism. To say that this demonstrates the end result of a belief in evolution is vapid and sophomoric. What it does demonstrate is the precision with which the Nazi's succeeded in creating the ""other"" whether it was the Jews, Gays, or the Gypsies, instilling fear and loathing of the other worked wonders. The methods are  identical to the religious rights' current anti-gay campaign. What I am sure that the previous reviewer was referring to was eugenics, not evolution. Eugenics had it's supporters in the United States as well, and in some circles, still does. The non-acceptance of diversity was the hallmark of the Nazi party and the video makes us realize what can happen when we believe that the ""father"" figure, and purity must be it obeyed, heavenly or otherwise.",1145577600,7,852,5.0

8078075,5,B000ADWCV2,"My husband is a WWII history buff and has a number of books, videos, etc. I bought this DVD for Christmas for him, it looked like something he may not have seen before. I can't say it was enjoyable for him to watch considering the content, he did say he learned things he hadn't previously known. It is all actual footage and has very little narrative, nothing is interpreted. He said he was amazed how many camps Germany had, many more than  one usually hears about. He was struck by how life went on as usual for the locals when in their back yard there was a concentration camp where people were tortured and died.

Unlike some in this country that are trying to eradicate our nations history, we applaud the efforts of those that are preserving the horror of what man can do to man. We should never forget because ""those that refuse to learn from history are doomed to repeat it"". We should pray that we never again turn a blind eye because getting involved is not politically popular.",1514937600,3,989,4.458563535911602

8078081,5,B000ADWCV2,"As a one star reviewer stated, Trervor Howard's voice is not that of Captain Bligh in Mutiny on the Bounty for two important reasons. Trevor Howard is not playing the self-righteous, cruel Captain of the Bounty but is instead recounting one of humanity's lowest moment. Howard's voice is weighted  as the reviewed said but not with fatigue caused by a lack of sleep but weighted instead the crushing inhumanity of those who actively engaged in this deed and those of humanity who turned a blind eye while the deed is done. The reviewer who said he has seen it all before has not seen it even once. It is indeed unfortunate that there is no mention of the killing of the SS group for that would have allowed the viewer to realize that justice is not possible in this context. This documentary is unfortunately the final word.",1468627200,,824,4.605442176870748
