8179670,5,B000A8NR8O,"BOTH FILMS I THOUGHT WERE GREAT. THE KUNG FU WAS EXCELLENT WHICH IS WHY I WATCH THESE FLICCS. LO REI IS GREAT IN PRETTY MUCH EVERY FLICC I SEE HIM IN. BOTH FLICCS HAVE THE SAME EXACT PEOPLE IN IT. IT SEEMS LIKE THEY MADE ONE MOVIE AND AS SOON AS THEY WERE DONE WENT STRAIGHT INTO MAKING ANOTHER ONE WITH THE SAME PEOPLE. LOL!! THE ONLY DOUBLE FEATURE I THINK COULD MESS WITH THIS IS ""RED DRAGON OF SHAOLIN/LEGEND OF THE TIGER""....",1230768000,,430,4.192771084337349
8179671,3,B000A8NR8O,"(Shaolin Vs. Ninja),,,Not a bad flick,,but I though the story became too confusing. It's almost seemed like they threw a bunch a great kung fu fighters into a ring and say fight for no apparent reason.  The fight scenes are amazing and a very entertaining movie to watch,,especially only for the fights!!  I gave this flick a 3 star for a good effort!!",1149552000,,352,4.571428571428571
