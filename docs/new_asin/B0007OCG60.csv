2223765,5,B0007OCG60,"Some viewers have placed this exciting film 'La Flor de mi secreto' into the 'not up to standard' Pedro Almod&oacute;var films, a classification this viewer finds difficult to understand.  Filmed in the luxuriously colorful palette (especially the repeated use of the color red in every scene) that has become his trademark, set with a musical score that includes Spanish song and guitar and flamenco, and introducing a wildly disparate group of over-the-top women played by a bevy of fine actresses - it all seems echt Almod&oacute;var to me.  No, there is not the outrageous side of gender bending that suffuses many of his more popular films, but there is a fine story that resonates throughout this remarkable movie that makes it very much worth the attention of lovers of Spanish cinema.

The film opens during the credits on a woman being informed that her 16-year old son is brain dead as a result of a motorcycle accident and two young doctors (including the irrepressible young Jordi Molla) are trying to convince her to allow the respirator to be disconnected and the boy's organs harvested for donor transplant.  Sad, tense though this opening is we discover soon enough that the trio are actors making a demo film for medical personnel to learn to deal with such possible family encounters!  Point: what appears to be a tragedy becomes a 'farcical depiction' guided by a seminar leader Betty (Carmen El&iacute;as).  Flash into a different scene and we me Leo (the immensely talented Almod&oacute;var favorite Marisa Paredes), depressed to the extreme over the failure of her marriage to her beloved Paco (Imanol Arias), a NATO 'soldier' who took assignments as far from Leo as possible.  Now Leo continues to write her trashy novels she has never had published while clinging to the Paco (she wears his clothes, currently his boots) she cannot recover.  Noting that the boots are too tight she leaves her typewriter to flee into the streets to find someone to remove the painful boots and after frustrating encounters with less than helpful people, she turns to her best friend Betty (yes, at a seminar!) who successfully removes the shoes.  It seems Paco had an affair with Betty, a fact that further flails at Leo's pain.  Betty assuages her by introducing her to a literary editor &Aacute;ngel (Juan Echanove) who asks Leo to come on staff as a critic - most particularly to review the 'example manuscript' Leo has presented him in applying for the job.  The reaction is predictable and Leo is at odds with how to continue her life.

Along the way of the story Leo gets advice from her hilarious mother and sister (Chus Lampreave and Rossy De Palma in typical Almod&oacute;var creations!) and from her maid Blanca (Manuela Vargas) and Blanca's son Antonio (Joaqu&iacute;n Cort&eacute;s) who perform Spanish ballet as a side line (and incredibly well, too - with some wonderful flamencoesque moments of artistic relief). Coincidences happen that allow Leo to ultimately catch a new perspective on her life without Paco - in a most unexpected way.

So what is not to love about this Almod&oacute;var opus? For this viewer, absolutely nothing.  It is a delight from beginning to end and deserves reconsideration in placement in the gifted director's echelon of works.  Highly Recommended. Grady Harp, September 06",1157241600,9,3325,5.00907441016334
2223766,4,B0007OCG60,"THE FLOWER OF MY SECRET is one of those titles that can strike you at first as being evocative, and then, upon further reflection you might say, ""What the hell is that supposed to mean?""  Well, maybe it loses something in the translation, and maybe it's a cultural or literary reference that is just lost on me. But I suspect I'm not alone.  Looking over the reviews posted below, I'd guess that ""What the hell is it supposed to mean?"" sentiment may be many viewers' response to the entire movie.

Despite my qualms about the title, I wound up liking it myself.  But the friend at whose home I watched the film, pretty much just shrugged.  We both like Almodovar, so we were starting out from the same place, you could say.  And this film is trademark Almodovar in many ways.  In fact--in contrast to many of the reviews posted--we both felt that FLOWER had many many over the top moments as his other films.  But they were, how you say?, discreetly over the top.

The film has been described as being an homage to classic women's films of the 30s, 40s, and 50s, and its star Marisa Paredes does have a kind of Joan Crawford thing going on.  She's got a certain steeliness that one could easily take for a kind of classiness--if she didn't do such ludicrous things as wear too-tight boots (which she winds up asking friends and even total strangers to take off for her)simply because her absent husband gave them to her.

Come to find out, hubby is in NATO and has been alternately been spending time in Brussels and Bosnia (this is at the height of the conflict there).  But it comes as no surprise that he is not just a good soldier: he has actively sought out assignments that would remove him from his troubled marriage.  Nor is it such a surprise that he is really having an affair with his wife's best friend (and boot remover of last resort).

Almodovar's strategy, however, seems to be to mix up the predictable and the surprising.  Paredes' character, Leo(cadia) Macias, is a classic jumble of contradictions: willful yet dependent, strong yet vulnerable--traits not at all unusual for ""women's movie"" heroines.  In fact that kind of black and white ""tough but tender"" contrast has always been a ""woman's flick"" commonplace.  Almodovar adds a few subtle twists.  Leo goes through a period of despair after her marriage crumbles.  There is even a failed suicide attempt.  But even before things came to a head on that front, she had taken a few tentative steps towards a new life.  She takes on a new job.  She meets a new man who is obviously simpatico and will (just as obviously) be there for her when she needs him.  Things are falling into place on one front even before they fall apart on the other.

I have yet to see all of Almodovar's films, but I do admire his ability to create his own universe in each of those I have seen.  FLOWER OF MY SECRET--despite its ambiguous title, or maybe even because of it--has its own internal logic.  It's a world that's just a little more absurd, a little more dramatic and a little more cinematic than our day-to-day reality, but it all makes sense on its own terms.  I like to think that's what movies should do.",1153785600,6,3167,4.529929577464789
2223767,4,B0007OCG60,"Not the ""typical"" Almodovar film, and without the spectacular touch, but a good reflexion on confidence among other things. Humour and rhythm are Almodovar all right.",1122508800,,166,5.423076923076923
2223768,4,B0007OCG60,"Not as emotionally intense as Live Flesh; not as stinging and punchy as What Have I Done to Deserve This?; not as all-out wacky as Tie Me Up, Tie Me Down!, this is nevertheless an enjoyable piece of cinema that, more than anything else, wears its heart on its sleeve--proving that, at least somewhere inside him, director Pedro Almodovar is a real softie.

Combining flamenco (not seen in any other of his films), paella, romance novel ghostwriting, a crumbling marriage, a sentimental editor, a lovestarved writer, and a few other choice characters, Almodovar offers this movie treat as he would a sugary confection to his eager audience, just knowing they'll eat it up. And we do.

Leo--a woman writer--secretly writes romance novels to make a big chunk of money, but is more complex than that, savoring a long list of ""suicidal woman writers""--Djuna Barnes, Virginia Woolf, Dorothy Parker, and many others. Married to a career soldier, Paco, who's too busy helping Bosnians to pay attention to Leo, she turns to her friends for help, and to the bottle, and, eventually, to a newspaper editor, Angel (a man) who takes her on after being smitten with her.

That's the story in a nutshell, but the film has the Almodovar stamp all over it. We have the feisty mother (very similar to the one in What Have I Done to Deserve This?--in fact, played by the same actress), the young stud guy, the semi-neurotic female friends/peers of the female protagonist, the misunderstood male lead(s), etc.  But that's fine; the director makes the dialogue his own (he should; he wrote it, also!) and we know it's his and are all the better for it.

While not the best Almodovar, this is still very entertaining and substantially better than many other films out there.",1120348800,4,1752,4.826666666666667
2223769,4,B0007OCG60,"This one was a bit abrupt and underdeveloped in my humble opinion. I say that only when comparing this to his other works. The dialouge, characters, and thoughtful + artistic  camera work are all there, but the film does not delve quite as deep as ""Live Flesh,"" ""Women on the Verge...,"" ""What Have I Done..."" or ""All About My Mother.""

Marisa Paredes plays a famous novelist, who writes under a psudonym, Amanda Gris. As her personal life falls apart, her Amanda Gris life takes an unexpected turn.

You will recognize many Almodovar regulars, but missing is the amount of risque humor that you may be accustomed to in his films.

Still a fine pick for lovers of fine film.",1116633600,2,673,4.630252100840337

2223771,4,B0007OCG60,"Sweet, and very well acted. This is much less wild and outrageous than earlier Almodovar, but compensates by having more real emotion.

It's beautiful, shot in a more subdued style than his earlier work.

2223783,5,B0007OCG60,"Almodovar's work seems to follow a progression. It seems to me that The Flower Of My Secret actually marked the beginning of a new stage. As opposed to his previous movies, this one leaves off most of the comedy effects to focus on the intricacies of a writer's life, Leo (short for Leocadia), who struggles to find her way in a life that everybody insists to keep her sheltered from: Her husband doesn't love her, her best friend keeps a shocking secret from her, and even her maid and the maid's son keep a double life behind her back... All this under the excuse or assumption that she is too fragile to deal with it, though that is also a way of covering their own selfishness. When the truth finally surfaces, she is forced to create a new life out of the old one with the help of her sort of crazy family and her new boss.
One of the curiosities of this movie is how it contains the seeds for two other movies Almodovar will make later:
- The scene on the transplant seminar (played by Kitty Manver as a coach nurse in this movie) will be reprised at the beginning of All About My Mother (with Cecilia Roth in the same role).
- The story that Leo delivers to her horrified Romantic Novel editors, about a mother who hides the corpse of her husband in a freezer after he rapes his stepdaughter and is killed in self defense, seems to be the original idea for Volver, that Almodovar will film years later.
Though certainly it might be said this movie is not the best Almodovar ever filmed, especially when he is always trying to top himself, it is well above average, with a complex character development, and well plotted. Definitely, an underrated movie.",1240531200,4,1660,4.445901639344262
2223784,4,B0007OCG60,"The Flower of My Secret is a charming surprise about a middle-aged, Spanish romance writer who is devastated when her husband leaves her.  The plot is actually fairly predictable.  What makes this movie so enjoyable is the main character, Leocadia, who is beautiful, talented, and flawed.  In fact, it is her flaws (her penchant for melodrama and booze, to name two of them) that endear her to the viewer. This movie is the perfect way to spend a rainy weekend afternoon.",1227139200,2,471,4.790123456790123
2223785,4,B0007OCG60,"""Flower of My Secret"" is a more reflective, less manic film than viewers of Almodovar have come to expect, and I for one am glad.  One of his favorite themes, the fluid elusiveness or complexity of personal identity, comes through here loud and clear.  There's a lot going on in the film--way too much, as a matter of fact--but Almodovar followers have come to expect this, too.  But this film is easier to navigate than many of his movies (such as the dreadful ""Kiko""), and it has its genuinely sweet moments.

The film focuses on Leo (wonderfully played by Marisa Paredes), a romance novel queen whose life is falling apart.  She's too dependent on Paco (Imanol Arias), a husband who's lost interest in her and too fixated on her own grief.  She's not an utterly self-centered woman; she takes good financial care of her sister (played by the ever-good Rossy de Palma) and mother.  But she's too clingy, and her inability to hang onto Paco is leading her to despair, drink, and a botched suicide attempt.

Enter Angel (Juan Echanove), editor of a newspaper who falls in love with her and in the utterly selfless way that we expect of angels helps her to recover from her sense of abandonment and recognize that life must be taken as it comes.

This exploration of romantic abandonment would've been quite enough for one film.  But Almodovar's fertile imagination just can't hold back from cramming lots more into the movie.  So there's the theme of authorial integrity and identity that serves as a subplot (Leo insists on writing her romance novels under a pen name, but has come to despise them--the fluidity of identity theme), a bit but not totally distracting (and it serves as the occasion for Leo meeting Angel).  Much more distracting, however, and totally unnecessary is a subplot--again, typically Almodovar--of a flamenco performance.

Watch the film for Paredo's performance--and the flamenco is beautiful.  But keep in mind that it's got all the messiness that one usually finds in Almodovar.",1220486400,,2007,4.882005899705015
2223786,3,B0007OCG60,"I'm a big Almodvar fan and of Marisa Paredes, too.  But to get right to the point: Skip this one.

2223787,5,B0007OCG60,"The wonderful achievement of Spanish filmmaker Pedro Almodvar is his ability to take the material of melodrama and soap opera and with the lightest touch turn it into life affirming entertainment. This 1996 film set in Madrid has another of his women on the verge of a nervous breakdown - several, in fact - and follows her through a series of life crises to a happily bittersweet ending. Marisa Paredes plays the woman, a hugely successful romance writer, who has a tempestuous marriage to an army officer that's headed for divorce, a mother and sister who never stop berating each other, and a best friend who as a grief counselor could give them all lessons on how to give and take bad news but has some bad news of her own she's not revealing.

Add a faithful housekeeper and her son, trying to persuade her to return to a career as a heart-stopping flamenco dancer, plus a soft-hearted newspaper editor ready to come to the rescue, and you have most of the elements of a closely interwoven story that doesn't stop moving until the last breakable object has been thrown and the last tear dabbed away with a tissue. The music track ranges from tango motifs to Miles Davis; there are references right and left to other movies and literature; and the sets and costumes are all bright colors with an emphasis on red.

8049459,3,B0007OCG60,"A big disappointment. Right from the start, Leo (Marisa Paredes) is too weirdly frantic and needy. She cries way too much. It gets irritating. She is supposed to be intelligent and perceptive. Why cant she see that Paco no longer cares about her? He all but wears a sign. Betty says as much. Angel is instantly in love with Leo, although she is an obvious basket case.

The arguments between Leos mother and sister are a bit funny, but then they get irritating. Another irritating thing: Leo goes into a bar/caf. She listens to the tragic song on the TV and she starts to cry. She goes on crying for way too long, with no dialogue. I hope you like the song, because it goes on forever.

Some of the digressions are too much. Leos cook is a great artist and makes a triumphant return to the stage. It just seems absurd and uncredible, not  whimsical or funny.  The long sequence of medical workers role-playing about organ donations was a confusing way to start the movie, although there was a payoff.

This is a great role for Marisa Paredes. All of the other actresses are strong, too.  The scenes of the women together are sometimes charming and always interesting.

8049466,5,B0007OCG60,"Few people seemed to like Almodvars 1995 melodrama, The Flower of My Secret at the time of its release. It represented an unexpected departure from the directors usual outrageously bouncy sex-filled, drug-fuelled gender-bending. Coming particularly after the indescribably wacky Kika (1993) and that films jokey rape and air-born semen, this films sober tale of the break-up of a middle-aged womans marriage seems on casual viewing positively dull and not Almodvar-like at all. Examined closely however and we discover that as much as the style has changed (frantic kinetic cutting giving way to long slow scenes of Bergman-esque psycho-drama), the film is still brimming over with this idiosyncratic directors usual preoccupations. Indeed, looking back from 20 years on, this film emerges as a remarkably courageous achievement vital to the change in direction Almodvar took. We appreciate it is the absolutely straight melodramatic womans picture he needed to make before he could re-integrate his trademark transgressive concerns into the serious and altogether deeper metaphysical context of his next five highly acclaimed films, from Live Flesh (1998) through to Volver (2006).

The most obvious trademark Almodvar ingredient to endure is the portrayal of a woman in emotional crisis. Very much Woman on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown (1988) minus the farce, the film tells the story of Leo (the wonderful Marisa Paredes), a writer of soppy romantic womens fiction published under the pseudonym Amanda Gris. Disenchanted by her soldier husband Paco (Imanol Arias) deserting her to fight in the Bosnian war, aware she is child-less (emphasized by her apartment overlooking a school playground), and reliant on her one and only friend Betty (Carmen Elias), she feels life has left her sitting on the shelf. She yearns for her husband to return. Something that can never happen, this makes the film an essay on self-denial among other things. She also wants to throw off her Amanda Gris flowery nonsense and write serious literature about the real world, but is stymied by contractural obligations to her reluctant publisher. She loses self-esteem and is slipping into alcoholism. What saves her are those other Almodvar staples, female friendship/solidarity and family. Betty does everything for her from taking off her boots to introducing her to culture editor of a national newspaper Angel (Juan Echanove). Betty also has been carrying on an affair with Paco which far from breaking up Leos marriage, simply makes her face up to something which has been dead for years. After the films crucial confrontation between wife and husband (she all rosy-eyed self-denial, he all bitter nihilism), Betty gives up Paco in favor of supporting her friend. Leo is also helped greatly by Angel whose attempts at romance makes her feel her own worth as a woman. But its a trip with her mother (the wonderfully characterful Chus Lampreave encouraged to play as if she were Almodvars own mother) back to her home village in La Mancha (Almodvars own homeland) which really revives her spirits. As well as the virtues, the problems of family are beautifully conveyed in a sharp slanging-match double act between mum and Leos sister Rosa (Rossy De Palma) who live together supported by Leo in a Madrid apartment. A return to roots and a re-affirmation of a Spaniards emotional link to rural village life  a poem recited by the mother in the car, a weaving sequence with 6 old ladies (including Leo) in the village replete with a folk song, and most importantly flamenco bolero dance rhythms from the opening credits through to the end  are recurring themes throughout all later Almodvar. As the mother says, when you have lost your man either to death of divorce, you must return home to get in touch with yourself again. That, coupled with the support of Angel is what sets Leo back on the road to recovery.

Another Almodvar preoccupation which gets very subtle expression in this film is the directors concern for meta-fiction  the foregrounding of narrative construction and the use of a second voice detached from, but still representing Almodvars own as over-arching writer-director. In this case the voice belongs to Betty. Note the strange prologue featuring a mother (Kiti Manver) being convinced by two doctors into letting them use her dead sons body for organ donations. The camera focuses on this scene for a long time and convinces us that the mother must be the main character of the film we are about to watch. But then Almodvar cuts to our actual main character Leo waking up in her apartment. Cut back to the mother and we realize that what we have seen is being shot by a second camera with Betty the psychiatrist/director of a seminar being given to an audience of doctors. Only later when Leo bursts in to talk to Betty do we appreciate that she is the films main character, not the mother or Betty. The mother and the two doctors disappear never to be seen again (at least not until All About My Mother which features the same situation with different actors) and Betty seems to take a back seat as the film then proceeds to follow Leo. But does Betty take a back seat? Look closely and we realize the narrative is spun entirely by her as a psychiatrist/director doppelgnger for Almodvar himself. It is Betty who introduces Leo to Angel and it is Betty who sleeps with Paco to in effect wake Leo up to the falsity of her marriage. She was Pacos psychiatrist for years before she started sleeping with him, and Leos crisis is resolved in psycho-analytic terms in a kind of therapy. Leos neurosis in the first half of the film is that she is two people in one. On one hand she is Amanda Gris - a sentimental romantic wanting to believe everything is rosy and will work out fine once Paco returns to her. On the other hand she is a hard realist who is burning to get in touch with her real emotions. Betty the psychiatrist director solves her neurosis by forcing her to throw off her delusions (by sleeping with Paco) and then by paring away her Amanda Gris identity onto Angel who agrees happily to ghost write the remainder of the novels demanded by her publisher. This concern with meta-fiction started for Almodvar in The Law of Desire (1987), is stated subtly through Kika, this film and All About My Mother, before assuming more aggressive form in Bad Education (2004) and especially in Broken Embraces (2009).

Returning to The Flower of My Secret, we do notice that despite the strong presence of Almodvars themes and preoccupations, the character of Angel is unusual for this director in being straight and almost type-cast as emotional rock in much the same way as happens to the male characters in Stella Dallas (1937, King Vidor) or Mildred Pierce (1945, Michael Curtiz). It is no coincidence that Almodvar depicts Angels romantic advances in terms borrowed from other films. Angel directly invokes both The Apartment (1960, Billy Wilder) and Casablanca (1943, Michael Curtiz) and most obviously closes the film with a direct quote to Rich and Famous (1981, George Cukor) which happens to be another film about writers (played by Candice Bergen and Jacqueline Bisset) who play the two halves of Leos character in the present film. Angel is a character who has also been scarred by life. He seems to drink more as Leo drinks less in the course of the film, but the lack of transgression about him to which Leo is finally attracted through her return back to her roots is what gives this film its seriousness. With a series of brilliantly shot psycho-dramatic scenes Almodvar takes up big metaphysical themes without his tongue ever being in cheek. We get a quiet and understated meditation on loss, self-denial, self-preservation, personal rejuvenation, love, family, generosity and faith. Post-modern as Almodvar fundamentally is, his films are always a grab-bag of cultural references both high and low, and even though the Hollywood womans weepie is the first port of call, the films tone recalling Ingmar Bergman (Persona [1966], Autumn Sonata [1978]) through Woody Allen (Another Woman [1988]) resonates strongly. In an interview on this disc Almodvar (never the modest one!) says I am as good as Allen and Bergman at directing women. To which I can only add that hes not bad at directing men either! This is a wonderful film. Best buy it in Optimum Worlds Vol. 2 box set which also includes Matador, The Law of Desire and Kika. Outstanding picture quality and absurdly cheap price, I strongly urge you to buy it",1445817600,,8536,4.940807799442897
8049467,5,B0007OCG60,"One of my favorites! It's as if Almodovar said to himself, 'I think I know how to make a decent soap opera and it will be fun, it will have some music, there will be some dancing, and there will be some lovely middle-aged heterosexual romance.' Then he did that. It works.

The music is wonderful. There's some light humor. The male romantic lead has a paunch. The kisses are sweet, not sloppy. This is a delightful movie. Trust me.",1441929600,,432,4.4
