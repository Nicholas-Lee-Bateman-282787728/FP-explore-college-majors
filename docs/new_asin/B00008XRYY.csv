7987880,1,B00008XRYY,I would buy another copy if it would give me the 20 minutes back I spent watching this video. I put it on FF X3 speed  and watched it all in 20 minutes... was still pissed.,1313798400,,172,3.7777777777777777
7987881,1,B00008XRYY,"The DVD is a collection of random videos featuring trucks and partially promoting their other DVD's.  Some of the stunts... such as jumping roads in busy suburban areas are idiotic.  You and a friend with a decent video camera could have better results.

Don't get me wrong, I highly recommend the other videos by Teckademics just ""steer"" clear of this one!",1147392000,,357,4.819672131147541
7987882,5,B00008XRYY,"I thought this was a great DVD, the only thing I didn't like was that they showed some 4x4's. Bagged and bodydropped is the only way to roll! If you want to see lifted trucks, go to a monster truck show hillbilly.",1080345600,,213,4.095238095238095
