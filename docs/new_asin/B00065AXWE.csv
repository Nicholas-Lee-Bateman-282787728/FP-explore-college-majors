The Instruction is very slow and very boring and one movement is shown from 4 different camera angles when really one would be enough for anyone with an ounce of sense in their head. It does say that it will concentrate on the basics, and by George, that is exactly what it does.....BASICS. Disapointing to say the least.",1197504000,5,407,4.298701298701299
8316924,2,B00065AXWE,"Well if these guys are to be believed, when you're attacked in a real fight, by more than one attacker, each of your attackers will hang on until you've dealt with his comrade, and each of these attackers will never use more than one attack and never end up on the ground. The physical ability of the instructors is beyond doubt, I just wish they wouldn't try to make people believe karate bunkia works in the real world. I feel this series is vastly over priced.",1102809600,8,463,4.395348837209302
