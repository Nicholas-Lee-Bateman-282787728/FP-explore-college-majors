1286624,5,B00003CXP4,"The Ladies Man is by far one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. I couldn't wait til the dvd came out. Tim Meadows is absolutely hilarious in this movie and the supporting cast is pretty good too.

1286626,4,B00003CXP4,"This movie is filled with hysterical, yet typical, SNL one-liners and quick witt.  If you've enjoyed Mr. Meadows on SNL, you HAVE to see this movie.  Tim Meadows is Leon Phelps, a DJ who provides extreme advice to listeners.  After a run of bad luck, he is terminated from his job and must find a past lover who will make him rich.  His search is long and hilarious.  This 90 minute movie will have you slipping out of your seat from comedic relief.  It's sexual refrences and regular pimp like scenerios remind us that we all know someone like Leon.  It could be our boyfriend, father, uncle, cousin, friend from the local bar, or even your own brother.  If you're looking for something to make you cry with laughter rent or buy this movie.  It's the best SNL movie.  Underrated by critics, this movie will have you in a good mood for days.",987465600,4,841,4.437908496732026

1286829,2,B00003CXP4,"Ladies Man was a funny sketch on SNL, but the character and the concept wear thin when stretched to movie length.  Leon Phelps is funny because he is raunchy and outrageous, not so much when the primary concern of the movie is to make him aware being outrageous is not desirable.  Give him some insight and a true love interest (yes!) and something less than lewd to say, and you have a whole new Leon Phelps.  Except he isn't funny anymore.  And neither is the movie.  Add in cliche elements like gay musical parody, big penis jokes, and a love-soaked happy ending and you have a classic example of what happens when funny skit is tortured into a full length debacle.",1441065600,,668,4.487603305785124

1287058,2,B00003CXP4,"I have always been a fan of SNL, but there films made about skit characters have always been a little disappointing. There are a few exceptions. The Ladies Man was never one of my favorite characters, but my wife always thought it was a funny skit. The film is nothing more than a stretched out skit from SNL, but it does have a few funny moments, mostly due to funny man John Witherspoon. The pickled bar food eating scene is a riot! Ladies Man isn't going to become a classic, but for fans of the skit, this will probably entertain you for its hour and twenty minute running time.",1290470400,2,582,4.348623853211009
1287059,4,B00003CXP4,"Joe Morgan, the Hall of Fame base stealer of the 1970s Big Red Machine (Cincinnati Reds baseball team), had long since retired and turned sports commentator in 2000 when this came out in the theaters. The guy couldn't stop talking about this movie - at one point I thought he was going to leave the announcer's booth to play hookie (from a baseball game) and catch the film.

He was going on and on and on during the White Sox /Mariners ALDS in how he was going to venture to the theater to catch this movie when it opened up...it turned into a repeated joke throughout the series.  All that being said, I drank the Kool-Aid as I was easily coerced by Morgan to see it in the theater.

Without realizing it, Morgan probably ended up selling half the box office tickets for this film...and I hope he really enjoyed it, because it's one of your standard SNL-ified B-movies that was destined to never really be that big.

It's not all it's cracked up to be, but it definitely has its funny moments.  Much of it plays angles on old cliches, wrapped with big hair in a 70s Superfly burrito.  Many might dismiss this as predictable knucklehead humor, but that's part of its charm...for those of us who appreciated classics like 'Caddyshack' and 'Airplane!', this can't be beat.

The dialogue is masterful and silly, Billy Dee Williams is PERFECT as the narrative bartender, and radio show Leon is pretty funny...along with the disenchanted jazz hands singing husband's group led by Will Farrell, there are also some clever, more subtle humorous speckles throughout (like the off-tune singing of Ken Hudson Campbell when they invade the house boat).  Catching hilarious moments like that requires your attention, which is hard to do in a movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.

Still, a decade later 'The Ladies Man' rewards repeated viewings if the mood strikes.  After all, if the articulate big-brained baseball announcer Joe Morgan likes it, there's obviously something to that.  I'm sure he'll be in line waiting for it when it comes out on Blu-ray...whenever that decides to happen.",1288137600,,2088,4.804469273743017

1287061,2,B00003CXP4,"I don't get the hype around Tim Meadows (is there hype?).  I mean, he's okay, but some people claim him to be this hilarious comic.  Sadly, I've never really found his acting to be all that funny, and this movie isn't really an exception.  He has his moments, but as a whole, this film is rather dull, and he doesn't do anything to save it any.  My sisters (questionable taste to say the least) love this movie and Meadows in it (I've never seen people laugh so hard at things I found blandly unfunny) but, well.

Like I said, it's shameless...but (there's that dreaded `but').

This film centers around Meadows' character Leon Phelps, a sex-addict who works as a sex advice radio personality until he goes too far one too many times and winds up fired.  His boss is fired alongside him, and while she struggles to find him another job, Leon finds himself distracted by the pursuit of a former flame who is boundlessly wealthy, offering her wealth in exchange for his loving.

I agree with some who say that, in the films second hour, things get better.  The plot (if you can call it that) is somewhat forgotten and the comedy starts to flow a little better (in a slapstick, SHAMELESS kind of way).  Even though the laughs are never as uproarious as we would expect from a film that offers NO intelligence whatsoever (this isn't a smart movie, so it should at least embrace its camp trashiness and give us loads of funny, right?) the laughs do come towards the end.

I mean, Will Ferrell may be nothing more than a shameless stereotype here, but his song and dance (literal and figurative) is the best part of the film for me (and that wrestling, LOL).

It's nice to see Karyn Parsons toss out her Hilary persona (yes, from `Fresh Prince of Bel Air) but she seems somewhat out of place here (her character is the only seemingly normal and or sympathetic, yet obviously stupid in love, in the whole cast).  Tiffani Amber Thiessen (yes, KELLY FROM SAVED BY THE BELL) so totally hot and bothered in this movie, and I almost recommend it just for her presence in the films conclusion, but even her allure isn't enough to make me do that.

This is dumb, and pointless, and sadly bland for the most part (the radio bits are hilarious in their absurdity, but apart from that the film is rather monotone until the conclusion).  I don't give it an F, because, well, it's not THAT bad, but a D feels about right.

Don't you hate the `but'?",1265673600,2,2429,4.486363636363636

1287115,4,B00003CXP4,"I've owned this film for a while, came across the reviews on Amazon, and thought I'd add my two cents.  Many of you are probably confused by the WIDE range of star ratings.  Most of us would probably agree that ""SNL"" films have less-than-stellar scripts, so a lot depends on the star and character.  Some think that Will Ferrell is hilarious; others find him truly annoying.  I think he's both.  Molly Shannon does nothing for me, Adam Sandler is hit-and-miss, and Chris Farley reduces me to happy-tears every time, (though he did take part in some wretched movies.)

This one makes me laugh.  A lot.  It really shouldn't, because on paper it probably looks like a steaming heap of excrement, but if you like (no, make that LOVE... the film IS 90 minutes,) Tim Meadows and his Ladies Man character, then you could do worse than shell out ten bucks on it.  Just make sure you watch it with friends who love the character too-- it really adds to the fun.  You'll be talking with a lisp for weeks.",1170115200,2,994,4.5027932960893855

1287117,2,B00003CXP4,"Tim Meadows (Mean Girls) stars at The Ladies Man, Leon Phelps, a radio love doctor who goes around seducing young fine ladies who have husbands. Meadows gets fired from a couple of radio jobs and soon he gets a letter from a woman who he cant remember her name but remembers the funkidelic sex that they had in the laundromat. So, Meadows goes back to the women he sexed it up with trying to figure out who this woman is. Meanwhile, the husbands of the wives Meadows sexed it up with formed a group so that they can track down Meadows and do harm to him. The group is lead by none other then Will Ferrell (Old School, Anchorman), who liked wrestling around with guys a lot...and I mean a lot. The husbands do a song and dance number that is so annoying, they burn Meadows love boat and try to track him down.

1287120,4,B00003CXP4,"The under-appreciated, extremely talented Tim Meadows  finally got his moment in the big screen spotlight with 2000's ""The Ladies Man."" The film may not have been a commercial hit, but  in terms of delivering good-hearted, somewhat risque laughs, it's a huge success.  Naturally, Tim plays Leon Phelps, his popular Saturday Night Live character aptly dubbed, ""The Ladies' Man."" Perhaps to avoid repetition from earlier SNL theatrical outings, in the movie Leon is made the host of a radio call-in show, rather than a television show as in the well-known Saturday Night Live skits. Nothing else has changed, however, as Leon is still the same light-hearted, lisping, clueless swinger, with the right answers to all your romantic queries.  Unfortunately, Leon's answers are often flat out wrong, not to mention highly offensive.  And when his keen interest in ""da butt"" gets him in trouble one time too many, he and his producer, Julie Simmons (The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air's Karyn Parsons), find themselves on the search for a new radio station to work for. Leon is sidetracked from the seemingly hopeless job-hunt, however, when a letter from a mystery woman promises to solve his money problems forever. If only he knew which of his many past ""Sweet Things"" the letter was from! And this isn't the sum of our leading man's problems. Leon is also being hunted down by an armed organization of vengeful husbands, the ""Victims of the Smiling Ass.""  It seems that Leon has a habit of including unsatisfied, married women amongst his many conquests, and the smiley face tattoo on his derriere is the only clue the V.S.A. has to his identity, but that will change before the story is over. Leon will find himself having to confront the vicious mob, his unwillingness to take on responsibility, and his feelings for his disenchanted producer, Julie, all at the same time!

In the end, everything works out well for Leon, if rather inexplicably. But that's not the important thing. As with so many other films centered around outrageous characters like Leon Phelps, the main focus is the humor of the quirky personality in the starring role, not the plot. Leon's hilarious appearance, speech impediment, and outlook on life are the reasons to watch ""The Ladies Man,"" and they're so entertaining that they are reason enough! The supporting cast is nothing to gloss over, though. As with any SNL movie, the film is studded with cameos and spot-on casting choices for the purpose of getting the most ""ha"" out of your ""ha-has."" The legendary Billy Dee (Lando) Williams is outstanding as the smooth talking bartender/narrator who recounts a back-story for Leon that fits the character to the bill. John Witherspoon never fails to crack me up, as he does here in the very funny role of ""Scrap Iron."" Lee Evans of ""Mouse Hunt"" is a personal fave too, and a couple of  ""Kids In the Hall"" alumni also make the scene! Of course, Will Ferrell is a comedic genius, even in the old comedy standby of a closet homosexual hiding behind machismo. Sure, it's a cliche, but Ferrell seems to know it, and makes it funny for that very reason! As funny and charismatic as they all are, though, this movie belongs entirely to Tim Meadows. This is HIS baby, and it's well worth picking up for repeat enjoyment. The DVD is practically bare bones, but it does include some cast and crew interviews, a theatrical trailer, and is presented in widescreen format, and those are the important things. Highly recommended for a night of laughs, time and time again!",1094860800,4,3525,4.873121869782971

1287122,5,B00003CXP4,"Leon Phelps, (Tim Meadows) the self proclaimed sex guru and woman extraordinare who hosts a Chicago radio show just giving advice on sex is in for it... A support group for the spouses and boyfriends of women he has cheated with has even been started and they are on a mission, to find the man they call ""The Man With the Smiley Ass Tatoo."" once they have accomplished this, supporting actor Lance DeLune (Will Ferell), olympic wrestler and apparently gay leader of the group, has a goal to rid Leon of his extremedies. This movie is absolutely hillarious, it depicts Leon and the troubles his on air obscenities get him into, such as being fired and fired once again and rejected and rejected and rejected from job after job after job. Leon and his beautiful assistant cannot seem to find work anywhere and furthermore, Leon is unable to pay for his houseboat which he has dubbed his ""Skanktuary"". But just when it seems like Leon has hist rock bottom, a miracle happens, he receives a letter from his ""Sweet Thing"" which is what he calls every woman, who says she is very rich and wants to run away with Leon because she so loved the times they shared together. The only problem is Leon has no idea who his sweet thing is and must set out on a quest to find her. If you love the SNL skit, you are positively sure to love this, but even if you have never seen the SNL skit, you are positively sure to love this; unless of course, you are among the few who hate crude and sexual humor... Then you will hate this. This film really does not have a deep plot, and this is good every once in a while. To relax and watch a funny, easy movie is, at times, much more fun than watching an academy award picture, AND THIS IS DEFINITLEY ONE OF THEM!!!!",1069977600,6,1742,4.346625766871166
1287123,4,B00003CXP4,"I came to appreciate this movie a little more after a second viewing.  Sure, it's a really, really dumb movie, and Tim Meadows' Saturday Night Live character Leon Phelps, aka The Ladies' Man, is stretched just about as far as he can be without snapping, but there are laughs to be found here, and the film really isn't as raunchy as you might think.  Leon Phelps is the perpetual 70s swinger who dispenses all of his wisdom in the ways of love on his own late night radio program.  A lot of that wisdom involves some rather unsavory advice, most of it involving ""da butt"" in some fashion, and Leon soon finds himself out of work alongside his attractive producer Julie (Karyn Parsons, who turns in a pretty impressive performance).  Unable to find a new radio job, Leon's troubles only increase when his womanizing ways make him the target of a group of men looking for the guy who seduced all their wives.  SNL's Will Farrel turns in a particularly memorable performance as the ring leader of the group and a really, really devoted Greco-Roman wrestler whose wife somehow doesn't understand his need to get oiled up and practice wrestling day and night with his friend Bryan.  With so much going on in his life, will Leon find the answer to all his money woes with a ""Sweet Thing"" from his past (if he can only remember which one of his former ladies she is), or will true love sneak up on him and make him a changed man?
The Ladies' Man features some notable names in its cast list: e.g., Tiffani Amber-Thiessen, Julianne Moore (in an inexplicable little cameo), and the ultimate ladies' man himself, Billie Dee Williams.  Billie Dee's presence lends a sense of class that is altogether missing without him, although he does play a prominent role in an unforgettable and hilarious practical joke of pretty crude proportions.  When it comes right down to it, The Ladies' Man must be judged in terms of its comedic aspects, and I have to say I found the movie quite funny.  If you found Tim Meadows' Ladies Man character on Saturday Night Live funny, odds are you will enjoy this movie.",1064188800,10,2086,4.601078167115903
1287124,1,B00003CXP4,"Yet another SNL-based film stars Tim Meadows as radio show host Phelps aka The Ladies Man who gets lucky whenever he wants.  I don't know how, but many women find him attractive, so as a consequencee many guys (mostly hapless husbands) hate him, and are trying to kill him, and one of them is Lee Evans (""Mouse Hunt""""There's Something about Mary"").  But one day he is fired by his boss at the radio station (Eugene Levy, ""American Pie), and has to find another job while trying to find the real love, and so on and on.
Like many other SNL films, the film is nothing but a jumbled collections of episodes, many of which are not interesting.  Maybe the main character works in short sketch, but not on film, which requires at least 90 munites.  But you know these things from the beginning.  The most unaccountable thing is that many women find him sexy while Tim Meadows has no charisma of Shaft.  Comedy?  I know, but 90 minutes are to long to see him repeating the same lisping speech.  Men like Will Smith can do better than that.
The best part always comes supporting roles.  Billy Dee Williams is good, so is Evans and Levy, but they are given too  short time.  And the greatest mystery of the film is one cameo appearance of Julianne Moore as a clown, who definitely should have known better.",1062806400,3,1297,4.476595744680851

While I Love Comedys This Can Never Be Up There With A Night At The Roxbury. I'm Sorry Mr. Meadows But You Really Blew [It]This Time.,1060646400,2,293,4.157894736842105
1287177,3,B00003CXP4,"Based on a SATURDAY NIGHT LIVE skit (The show doesn't screen in NZ, so please forgive my ignorance); along with IT'S PAT (ugh) and SUPERSTAR: DARE TO DREAM (marginally more bearable), THE LADIES MAN at first appears to be another seemingly futile attempt to expand a 5 minute skit to feature length. I was surprised to discover that this was actually a pretty funny movie.
Leon Phelps (Tim Meadows) is an alcoholic DJ with a thevere lithp who is stuck in a 70s time warp. He thpecialithes in thex therapy, and dethpite having a stupid afro, he thomehow manages to get the ladieth. How DOETH he do it?
The main gag here is that a lot of the men who phone in to his show with their marital problems are in fact the spouses of women Leon's been sleeping with. So when one of the women's husbands (Lee Evans from THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT MARY) catches him in the act, he and the other neglected hubbys round up a posse with the main objective being to kill Leon.
To make matters worse, Leon is fired by his boss (AMERICAN PIE's Eugene Levy) for his on air excesses. So this leaves Eugene and his pretty producer, Julia Simmons (Karyn Parsons- best known as Hilary on FRESH PRINCE) unemployed and maintaining and losing positions (One of them as DJ on a religious show and he misinterprets a nun talking about missionary work as...well, go figure). In addition to this Leon must avoid the outraged husbands who want to scalp his afro.
As a whole, THE LADIES MAN is a  pretty shallow affair, but Meadows is so funny that he helps redeem it. Familiar faces in cameo roles include Billy Dee Williams as Lester; a bartender who serves FEAR FACTOR style bar meals- though he goes a little further than even FF would dare!
And also making an appearance is Julianne Moore, in a role unlike any other she's played. In fact, it's actually quite disturbing. Watching her as Clarice Starling will never be the same after seeing her here. Even Dr. Lecter would be put off his fava beans and Chianti.",1058054400,,1981,4.533519553072626
1287178,3,B00003CXP4,"The Ladies Man basically came off as just an okay movie (I'm not exactly sure why it was rated R), but most Saturday Night Live movies aren't all that anyway. If you try to watch this movie and you have never seen a Ladies Man sketch on SNL, you'll probably think most of the jokes are sophomoric, so your best bet is to catch some SNL reruns with the sketch to get up to speed. But all in all, the movie seems like it would have been funnier if you saw it in the theater where you could watch it with an audience (and I mean a REAL audience, not a laugh track). I suggest you rent it first or try to catch it on HBO, but don't watch it alone; invite some friends over.

1287182,2,B00003CXP4,"Tim Meadows is the Ladies Man, the radio DJ love talk man and his goal, to please every woman he meets. And to also try and give us all a laugh.
O.k. I gotta say it, unfortunately the Ladies Man isn't one of Meadows' strongest SNL characters. In all honesty, when I saw this movie in the theaters, I basically thought that it was going to be like Austin Powers but instead it was weak character with no Action and reused and recycled sexual humor that got boring after a while.
That and the musical number to fund and beat the Ladies Man to death really cheapened the already played out in 10 minutes movie. By doing the little musical number, the movie just strung itself along until the end credits.
I really wouldn't suggest this movie because it's not as funny as some of the other SNL spin off characters. Molly Shannon's SUPERSTAR, Will Ferrel and Chris Kattan's NIGHT AT THE ROXBURY and who could forget Mike Myers and Dana Carvey in WAYNE'S WORLD? Those are 3 more preferrable SNL movies. Normally I love the work Tim Meadows does but this was just not a good movie for him. I gave it an extra star for a reason, it ended.",1040601600,5,1130,4.360189573459715

Tim Meadows' ""ladies man"" character is EXACTLY how you know him from TV....and then some! He manages to keep this character on the same level (as we've come to know him) all throughout the movie. His sexist comments are all here and he doesn't become ""a changed man"" by the end of the film (as so many other characters do). At the end of the film, he's the same funny, misguided, sexist radio show host we all love! Briefly, our hero is bounced from his show and is pursued by angry men whose wives have all slept with him. Why bother relating the whole plot? It's just a very fun movie to watch. You'll be using his catch-phrases well after the film's over and you'll watch it again! I hope Meadows does a sequel.

1287247,5,B00003CXP4,"Based on a skit that was never hugely popular, in and out of the theatres in a sneeze, and did I mention it's from SNL Studios?
Despite having three solid strikes seemingly against it, Ladies' Man may well be SNL's sleeper success, a genuinely funny film that actually stands up under multiple re-viewings.
Meadows never breaks character as the lisping 70s lover man, who manages to leave men envious, and women asking ""how does he get girls with those awful lines,"" particularly when Meadows' so-bad-he's-good character is placed in contrast to Billy Dee Williams, essentially playing himself, cool and oh so fly.
The plot is short and sweet, held together fairly well, although the ending is, admittedly, Hollywood manufactured claptrap that irritates but doesn't ruin the film.
The supporting cast is superb, which gives Meadows a few moments to take a breather, and also doesn't leave one character to carry the entire film.
