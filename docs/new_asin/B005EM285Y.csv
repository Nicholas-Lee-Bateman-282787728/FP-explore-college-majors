8468635,4,B005EM285Y,Pure Barre Flatirons Vol. 1 DVD is a quick workout but don't let the short duration fool you.  This workout is tough!  You definitely need more support than a chair for the standing exercises.  An at-home barre or a very sturdy counter will really help you out if you're just learning these moves.  The weighted ball can be tricky to balance if your work out pants are slick (as most are) so take your time and pause or re-play if you need to.  You won't be sorry you learned these moves.  Another must for this workout would be the Pure Barre grippy socks they sell on the Pure Barre site.  They really do aid in holding these poses and completing this workout.,1407974400,3,662,4.377049180327869
8468636,1,B005EM285Y,"Unfortunately, this workout was nothing like the barre classes I've been attending in town.  She barely uses the barre, the exercises are not challenging (what is most challenging is changing positions in the two seconds she gives you to move from one to the next--keep your pause button within reach!), and there is way too much stretching.  According to my heart rate monitor, I burned 97 calories.  Not worth it.  Also, it's only 36 minutes long, not 45.",1388966400,4,457,4.82051282051282

8468638,3,B005EM285Y,"I thought this workout would be more dance involved.  The workout was rather difficult and definitely not for beginners.  I wouldn't recommend this DVD to anyone that isn't in shape already because the workout goes fast.  I felt like the workout went too fast.  There wasn't enough time to figure out what move they were doing before they were on to the next one.  Also, it is difficult to do at home because it requires a ledge and wall to use that some people might not have access to in their home.  This DVD is not for just anyone so make sure you know what you are getting into before purchasing it.  If you are already in shape then this DVD would probably be best for you, but if you are looking to get into shape I would start with something easier first and then maybe get this DVD.",1321401600,7,791,4.268456375838926
