7964635,2,B000068TOP,For a long time i've been wanting to see this 4-film movie set but just known it as Blood Bath. I didn't realize i had half the movies on this and as with the other two devils nightmare i wanted to see since a friend told me of it neatly 16yrs. ago. I finally saw it today and have to say i might've enjoyed it if i was a lil younger but now at this age i didn't really find it likeable like i would've when i was15. Not bad for the price but not a film i'll end up holding on to in the future. Thank you!,1507075200,,505,3.685185185185185

7964638,1,B000068TOP,"This set includes 4 horror movies on 2 double sided discs as follows:
Pieces (1982) - Presented in Pan and Scan. Transfer moderate. Cut from 89 to 85 minutes. No subtitles. Some parts dubbed owing to fact different actors spoke their home language so film was dubbed in several languages which is not uncommon.
The Devil's Nightmare (1971) - Transfer moderate. This film was presented by Redemption and the opening splurge is still included. No subtitles. Some parts dubbed owing to fact different actors spoke their home language so film was dubbed in several languages.
Kill, Baby... Kill! (1982) - Presented in Pan and Scan. Transfer moderate. No subtitles. English dubbed only. Original Italian audio tot available.
Kiss Me Kill Me (1973) - Presented in Pan and Scan. Transfer moderate. No subtitles. English dubbed only. Original Italian audio tot available.
It's great to see these earlier titles released but Pan scan transfers and non-original sound tracks mire the joy. OK for $5 but not the $15 asking price.",1408752000,,1018,5.065476190476191
7964639,4,B000068TOP,i got this for $10 and it was well worth it for one of the four movies alone. Pieces is a classic 80's slasher flick that is so terrible it is great.,1199232000,3,149,3.6875
7964640,4,B000068TOP,"Devil's Nightmare-gotta own it

Peices-the weakest on this 4 pak, but still watchable

Kill Baby Kill-This is an excellent film, but I love these type of movies where a traveler takes a horse driven coach to a remote village and is warned don't go there, but he goes and finds a beautiful woman who had just returned to the town after years of studying abroad and a scared populace.  Can't go wrong with me.  Then you have Kiss me Kill me, which is a good little raggedy movie, it was also released under another title that skips my mind and I almost bought it again.  I have no problem buying several of the same DVDs on but Kiss Me Kill me ain't one of them.  I would recommend this 4 pak, hopeuflly Brentwood will bring some othoer classic films out of the closet and release on DVD such as Let's Scare Jessica to death and the Initiation of Sarah.",1135555200,5,851,4.320754716981132
7964641,4,B000068TOP,"This is B-movie heaven. I've seen The Devil's Nightmare twice already. Is this Oscar material? Of course not. But as Rob Zombie says in the latest Time Out, these movies are the punk rock of cinema -- tiny budget, sleazy, nonsensical but a great deal of fun.",1122336000,2,258,4.51063829787234
7964642,2,B000068TOP,"Just to let other shoppers know that the 4 titles on this DVD release are also available on Fright Night - 10 Movies, so don't order both!",1037318400,23,138,4.148148148148148
