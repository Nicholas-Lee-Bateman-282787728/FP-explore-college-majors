7891499,1,6305501386,"Karate Warriors was disappointing for three reasons: (1) the quality of the tape was so bad it was almost unwatchable due to blurriness, (2)the fight scenes were poorly filmed and didn't show off Sonny's abilities, and  (3) the plot seemed to be a disorganized splicing together of cliches and  bad acting.  I would NOT recommend this one, but DO recommend his first one  Street Fighters.",951004800,2,388,4.923076923076923
