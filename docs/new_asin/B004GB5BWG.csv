8428589,4,B004GB5BWG,"From the JFK assassination on down I suppose there will always be conspiracy theories. It's said that 79% of all rumors are true, so at least some of these theories should be right on the money.  From my point of view there is just way to much damning evidence in this presentation for it to not be the real deal. Welcome to the 79%.",1368921600,,333,4.203125
8428590,5,B004GB5BWG,When you are ready to delve into the real underground information this is where I would suggest starting. Nothing mainstream here which of course is what the ufo enthusiasts such as myself are always looking for.  Insightful info aplenty.,1368835200,,238,5.102564102564102
8428591,3,B004GB5BWG,"This is both a nicely documented survey of UFO sightings since WWII and a personal film by the author and his lifelong interest in the subject.  In this day of Wikileaks, it's hard to imagine nobody has really come clean about alien visitation, but if UFOs have visited Earth, the secret still holds, it seems.  The DVD contends the cover-up is a military decision, beginning with the German air force developing a craft from crashed UFO technology.  The Roswell incident and its cover-up is well documented.  A little less convincing is testimony from encounters by Jackie Gleason and Walter Cronkite and even Nikola Tesla.  Gleason claims to have seen Roswell debris and three short alien corpses with permission from his friend, Richard Nixon.  Cronkite has a similar story.

The Philadelphia Experiment is nicely explained.  Like Roswell, it's one of the most fascinating events of the 20th Century.  The film postulates that similar time-travel technology propels the alien ships through space.

The film is a bit of a home-made slide-show, but the images are authentic and I personally prefer this over contrived glitz.  The author, who also narrates, is apparently a controversial figure within the UFO community, but on this DVD he seems pleasant and likeable and very down-to-Earth, which enhances his credibility considerably.  I wish him well--as he documents, many men who've threatened the continuing cover-up have come to grief.",1315526400,,1442,5.221739130434782
8428592,3,B004GB5BWG,"Naturally, the title of this film was meant to show how the government wants us to believe that UFOs and aliens from other planets don't exist. They cover up anything and everything that could provide the public with absolute proof of existence of extraterrestrials. What I like about this DVD is the fact that the producer has included a lot of information from decades past and more recent. This way the viewer can get a good look at the years and years of government cover-ups. Sure, I've seen and heard a lot of this stuff before, but I still find it completely fascinating. The film maker is very passionate and knowledgeable about this topic.",1314489600,,648,4.692982456140351
8428593,3,B004GB5BWG,This DVD was very informative on how our government has unrevealed very important information from the public. It opened my eyes to what is really out there and how our very own Government is deceiving us. Apparently Alien technology has been used for generations. it astonished me how we can keep something so disturbing secret for many years. Makes me wonder who we can trust.,1307059200,,378,4.8307692307692305
8428594,1,B004GB5BWG,"I bought this DVD thinking since it came out in 2011 it would be up to date and the latest info. No reviews had been posted yet. Let me save you the money you might spend on this DVD.Don't buy it for 14.95, that is way too much for this poorly produced time waster. It is as if you are watching a lecture with slide presentations filmed in the early 70's and transferred to dvd, poorly. With very poor production skill or standards. All the pictures are blurry or out of focus. When the FAA is mentioned a picture of the FAA emblem shows on the screen,and it goes on like this. Various books are mentioned with cover shots. Most of the pictures are blurred on the screen. And he combines fake ufo shots in his story that detract from any hope of believability. In fact anytime he mentions numbers in the thousands, be highly suspect. You may suffer from wondering about the ""lost time"" you can't account for now that you've watched this turkey,not to mention the money.",1302825600,7,969,4.418994413407821
8428595,1,B004GB5BWG,"Clearly, the producer did a lot of homework on this.  However, the presentation is amateurish, at best.  The video is almost entirely composed of scans of old photos and old documents, with a voice-over by the producer.  The voice-over is filled with mispronounciations (IE: ""idears"" instead of ideas). No new information is included in the video.  The video is about 120 minutes long, not the 250 listed on the package.  The product description is misleading.  Poorly done and not worth spending time or money on, UNLESS you need a nap.",1302480000,6,537,4.911111111111111
