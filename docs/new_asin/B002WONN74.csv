This DVD is two concerts in one.  One from earlier years and one from more recent.  You can see that the band has changed a bit, but they still rock.

I would recommend this to anyone who likes thrash metal.  I would have like to see a better menu system, (smoother, I should say) but that didn't stop me from banging my head to this awesome DVD.

Must have for any thrasher's collection!",1301875200,2,565,4.166666666666667
