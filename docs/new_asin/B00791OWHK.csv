8512499,2,B00791OWHK,"I expected this DVD to be alike a concert or music videos but instead was simply a bio of a wonderful lady, that I could have watched on TV for FREE. So if you're looking for music, I wouldnt suggest this particular product.",1368403200,,224,4.232558139534884
8512500,1,B00791OWHK,I was very surprised and disappointed by the contents of this video. It did not journey her life in anyway and there was no narration or navigation. It went from one interview to another and you had to figure it out. It was not a good representation of Whitney at all. It ended with words scrolling on the screen that updated the viewer.,1340064000,2,337,4.365079365079365
8512501,1,B00791OWHK,"If you are a fan of Whitney Houston, do yourself a favor and DO NOT buy this.  It is just a bunch of british unknowns talking about Whitney Houston with just a few pictures of her sprinkled throughout.  Then they all sing their own original music.  I think this is just a way for a bunch of unknowns to get their music listened to by Whitney fans.  Using Whitney's name and her fans to promote their music.  A total waste of money for a true Whitney fan who will be totally disappointed with this dvd.",1338336000,16,501,4.231578947368421
8512502,1,B00791OWHK,I just feel robbed.  You should be ashamed of yourself for putting this up for sale. So sad that people take advantage of these situations.  It was a mess.,1338163200,21,155,4.310344827586207
8512503,4,B00791OWHK,We all love Whitney Houston and its good to hear and see her in this movie.  This is a nice documentary and a must have for all WH fans.,1337904000,,136,3.689655172413793
8512504,1,B00791OWHK,I am an avid Whitney Houston fan! I'm at a loss for words trying to accurately describe this piece of work. I can tell you for certain...it is not WORTH $15. There is no footage of Whitney other than a few album cover pictures. It's some people I've never heard of giving opinions about Whitney. Save your cash. You can do better watching YouTube! I would give it a half star if I could.,1337644800,26,387,4.243243243243243
