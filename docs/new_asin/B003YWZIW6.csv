8409858,4,B003YWZIW6,"I've never seen the entire ""Citizen Kane,"" only excerpts in documentaries but those made me aware of the controversy surrounding the film. This movie is all about that but I felt it only skimmed the surface.  Guess I'm just hard to please. I wanted more showing the making of the film, instead of merely one scene...perhaps how the ""Rosebud"" scene was shot.  I'd also liked to have seen more reason behind why Welles insisted on ""facing down"" Hearst. They meet at Hearst's dinner part, exchange a few words and the war is on.  Too fast. I also felt there should've been a little more of Welles' interacting with the outside world. He's far too insulated from what's happening, events are related to him by others while he's sequestered with his movie.  Surely it wasn't really like that. However, I guess only so much can be stuffed into an edited-down-to-two-hours event.

 In spite of that, Liev Schrieber's performance is great as the ""Boy Wonder."" It's good to see him in a non-villainous role for a change. The other cast members match him in style and ability, as the good veterans they are...recognizable faces all.  It's an entertaining movie about a momentous time in Hollywood's life when one man could wield so much power over so many. Perhaps in that context, Welles' likening of Hearst to Hitler as well as the comparison of the war in Europe to that smaller war in Hollywood, isn't too far off.

Real or imagined, events and characters changed for dramatic effect or not, it's a powerful and entertaining drama.",1416960000,,1525,4.771863117870723
