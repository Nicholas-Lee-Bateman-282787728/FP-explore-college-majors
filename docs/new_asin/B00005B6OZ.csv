1421439,4,B00005B6OZ,"Let's face it, John Waters makes some pretty bizarre films.  This pairing has two of his more accessible ones.  First there's ""Hairspray"", the better of the two, in my opinion, and the basis for the Broadway and movie musical.  This version's story is more involved than its musical counterparts and flows better.  The whole cast is pretty special and all get into the spirit of this slightly twisted film.  ""Pecker"" is harder to get into even though it has a good story about a young photographer, his family, and what happens when sudden fame hits them.  As with ""Hairspray"" all of the cast gets into their roles wholeheartedly.  The direction is well paced by Mr. Waters and his commentary tracks are hilarious.  The other production values (cinematography, sound, etc.) are very well done.  Unfortunately this DVD set is out of print and has to bought used but for John Waters fans, or those just curious to see the original ""Hairspray"" and want another good John Waters film together with it will want to invest in this set.  On an unfortunate, personal, side note a former co-worker of mine borrowed my set and never returned it before leaving for parts unknown.  Oh, well.",1287619200,,1179,4.787128712871287
1421440,5,B00005B6OZ,"I think these two movies are a must have for any Divine or John Waters fan. Even if they are pretty commercial and not as original as ""Female Trouble"" or ""Mutiple Maniacs""(hopefully the latter of the two will be on DVD soon)they are wonderful example of wonderfully talented and sometimes shocking director. The cast in ""Hairspray"" are great including Debbie Harry,Sonny Bono,Ricki Lake and of corse,DIVINE!! ""Pecker"" has its moments and will grow on you as any true John Waters will. If you have never seen a Water's flick,this is a good place to start.",1042329600,7,554,4.842105263157895
1421441,5,B00005B6OZ,"""Hairspray"" and ""Pecker"" are the tamest in the John Waters' collection. They are very enjoyable, even though they don't have the shock value that Waters earlier films had. I still absolutely adore both of these films and I'm thrilled that they are together on DVD. ""Hairspray"" is the last Waters' film that the late Divine appeared in. It showed the potential that Divine had in regards to his acting abilities. The movie is just flat-out fun, I would recommend it to anybody.
""Pecker"" is one of John Waters recent films that I thoroughly enjoy. Its a ahppy little story that just floats along on screen, its really a pleasure to watch.",1015372800,12,636,4.738738738738738
1421442,4,B00005B6OZ,"Of the three John Waters ""Special Edition"" releases, this is the only one that duplicates previous DVD releases...and thus it's the one collectors may opt to refuse.  (...) The bonuses in this package aren't must-haves, though any film commentary with John Waters is a delight.
I guess some reviewers have a valid point about the mainstreaming of Waters' films...and these two films are case(s?) in point.  But consider the limitations placed on the writer/director as his core cast was fragmented and the cost of filming movies soared skyward.  In both ""Hairspray"" and ""Pecker"" I see minor concessions to the bland tastes of Popular culture, but nary a cop-out.  (...) the subversive edge of Waters' often brilliant writing/direction is an ongoing exercise in (good) bad taste.  If nothing else, his characters never do what you expect of them, quite a virtue in a film world besotted with ""accessible"" characterization.
Despite some brilliant moments, ""Hairspray"" is a bit cloying on the whole.  This, in my opinion, is largely due to Ricki Lake in the lead role.  Despite the usual outrageous Waters' dialogue, Lake delivers her lines with such sweetness and reverance that you just want to backhand her.  To her credit, she furthers the old saw about fat girls being good dancers.
""Hairspray"" is also a bit overlong with dance sequences, though they certainly lend a touch of authenticity to the production.  The central story is roughly linear, though the bit with Tracy in reform school seems like a delaying tactic...especially since Waters' used a similar story device in ""Cry Baby"".  On the plus side, the supporting cast is rich with freakish appeal.  Divine's last role for Waters isn't flashy, but his Edna Turnblad is a credible, nuanced piece of work.  Longtime cast member Mink Stole gets lots of screen time in a fairly minor role.  Lots of silly and/or hysterical cameos: Pia Zadora, Ric Ocasek, Debbie Harry, Sonny Bono and a few more.  The youth leads (mostly unknowns) are right on target...thoroughly believable in their parts.
Overall, ""Hairspray"" is probably the most accessible of Waters' latter-day films (...).
""Pecker"" is a good choice to complement ""Hairspray"" in this edition.  Both films have youthful leads, and both deal (directly or indirectly) with social issues such as race and class.  The appeal of these films is also a bit gentler and good-humored than some of Waters' recent offerings.  ""Pecker"" might take a while to sink in with old-time fans, as it did with me.  I don't know if it's because there are other writers and directors actively pursuing the raunch genre that Waters' pioneered, or because ""Pecker"" has such simple charms.
I grudge the obligatory star power of Lili Taylor and Indie Waif Christina Ricci, low-wattage that it may be. Otherwise, the casting and performances in ""Pecker"" are on target. Mary Kay Place is fretful and yet blissfully sedate as the thrift store maven; a role that seems an appropriate homage to Waters' long time friend and star, Edith Massey. Martha Plimpton plays the ultimate fag hag (""My life is trade!"") with dizzy abandon. Ed Furlong's Pecker (um, keep reading) is the most functional idiot savant imagineable...a tireless servant to the ""art"" all around, and completely oblivious to social norms and responsibilities.
Despite a feel-good ending that smooths over a fair number of conflicts, ""Pecker"" is a funny and satisfying film. The rabid idiosyncrasies of Waters' characters play off each other with the kind of manic glee you can find in ""Pink Flamingos"" or even ""Polyester."" The 'turnabout' plot actually works, if you take a good look at some of Pecks' pics from his NYC premiere. (...)
Fans who already own ""Pecker"" on DVD may opt to wait for a single disc release for ""Hairspray.""  Considering how infrequently some of his films have been available on home video, I'm pretty sure longtime fans like myself will snap this collection up on sight. Recommended.

1421443,5,B00005B6OZ,"I'm not going to bother to review the actual movies themselves, since there is no point in criticizing perfection!  I'm thrilled to finally have ""Hairspray"" on DVD!  What I will say is:  I find it extremely puzzling that New Line decided to put ""Hairspray"" out with ""Pecker.""  I totally understand that ""Pecker"" is probably the tamest (along with Hairspray- ""Cry Baby"" was released by Universal so New Line probably doesn't have the rights to release it) of the John Waters movies- but I would say that it's safe to say that all of the John Waters fans with DVD players bought ""Pecker"" the day it came out!  (Well, I did!)  The ""Pecker"" DVD IS NOT the same DVD that was out before.  It has some new menu screens AND the cast/crew bios are now gone.  Everything else is the same.  The ""Hairspray"" DVD is great- the movie has never looked this good before!  I've seen the movie hundreds of times, and I discovered things I had never seen before when I watched the pristine DVD.  John and Ricki's commentary is interesting but it's glaringly obvious that the two of them did not record the commentary together.  New Line has attempted to sort of ""paste together"" their commentaries to make you think they were there together- but you can tell they really weren't.  Ricki's commentary is somewhat limited to her revealing that she was extremely upset about having to dye her hair and she says that she still wishes that she could have worn a wig. She also talks about how she got the part- but it's her comments on her hair that keep coming up!  (I guess she really has a reason to complain!  They really did a number on her hair!)  It would have been nice if John and Ricki could have recorded their commentaries together- to react against what each was saying.  Other than that- just about everything is perfection.  The packaging for this DVD could have been a little nicer with more pictures (the velcro that keeps it all closed is sort of CHEAP!)- New Line could have come up with something a little more clever- but I'M NOT COMPLAINING!  I'm just happy to have ""Hairspray"" on DVD!",992390400,12,2082,4.563342318059299
1421444,4,B00005B6OZ,"John Waters has long been known for his signature style... both disgusting and hillarious at once, and though he's ""softened"" through the years (you can't expect someone to see the wrld and act the same at 15 and 50), he always manages to deliver.
Hairspray was the movie that brought him the closest to mainstream, and his commentary (as well as that of Ricki Lake)on the new DVD is a real treat.  Waters mentions many things about the movie that I'd not read before on any website or book and each little gem (such as pointing out the cameo by Buddy Dean, the television host Corny Collins was based on) brought on a new appreciation for this film.
""Pecker"", the movie in Waters' collection seeming to receive the least attention, is brightened considerably with the photo gallery and interview with ""the real life Pecker"".  As with ""Hairspray"", the real joy is in hearing all the tidbits Waters serves up and in hearing them, finding a new level of enjoyment in the film itself.
Both of these discs are well done, with clever menu design and delicious commentary, my only complaint is that I wish we could have seen a bit more... some of the deleted scenes mentioned would have brought this to a five star rating, but i know those features cost money, so I'm not going to begrudge it too much.
A definate must for any fans, and a nice addition for anyone else who likes their comedy with that little something extra. :)",991785600,3,1422,4.572549019607843
1421445,4,B00005B6OZ,"What's going on here? ""Pecker"", already available by itself on DVD, is tagging along with the much-anticipated release of ""Hairspray"" in a 2-disc package...That gripe aside, these are two of John Waters' best films and a not-incompatible pairing. ""Pecker"" is a fairly sweet-natured portrait of a photographer who lives through his pictures, and because this is a John Waters film, his hobby takes him to strip clubs, etc. It's a good film and somewhat unjustly ignored. ""Hairspray"", however, is a riot : an affectionate look at teen life, pop music, race, etc., in 1963 Baltimore. Every performance is perfect, especially Divine in his most toned-down and tender role. Pop fans will enjoy spotting a teenaged Colleen Fitzpatrick (known today as pop star Vitamin C) as Amber, Rikki Lake's character's arch-nemesis. The best feature of these DVDs is John Waters' commentary track for each film. Revealing and funny! The price of this package is roughly the price of a single DVD...",990835200,9,979,5.125
7937034,5,B00005B6OZ,"2 DVD set Includes two John Waters classics. HAIRSPRAY: It's 1962 and Tracy Turnblad has the biggest bouffant on the block. She also has all the right moves to be on the local dance show and win the crown of Miss Auto Show, as well as the ex-steady of the snooty reigning princess, Amber. But Amber is not too happy and has other plans for Tracy. PECKER: The winning 10th feature from John Waters straddles a fine and wisely chosen line between the flaunted vulgarity of his early works and the sloppy kindheartedness of his later films. Set, as usual, in Baltimore, Edward Furlong (T2) stars as 'Pecker', a sweet-natured young fellow who gleefully fills his days photographing his surroundings with a cheap secondhand camera. Egging him on are his Virgin Mary-obsessed grandmother, his kleptomaniac best friend (Sexton III), and his girlfriend (Ricci), who runs a laundromat with an iron fist. However, when his works are 'discovered' by a slumming NYC art dealer (Taylor), Pecker's simple life and family are turned upside down, and Waters gets to take some well-deserved and on-target swipes at the pretentiousness of the art world and the true nature of fame. As usual with the works of Waters, those familiar with Baltimore culture will be even more richly rewarded.",1479772800,,1271,4.94392523364486
