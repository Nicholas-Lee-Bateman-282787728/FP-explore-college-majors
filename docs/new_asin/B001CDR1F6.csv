3511051,4,B001CDR1F6,"KENNY was shown Spring 2008 at Philadelphia Film Fest. The scuttlebutt (puns already!) were that this was a funny film; a title like KENNY didn't register its subject matter to me, but an Australian-- or was it New Zealand film, sounded promising to me. I'm jumping the gun here, but the reason I am unsure of where the film was made, is that I purchased 4 DVDs this fall for gifts to friends.  I promised myself after seeing KENNY last spring that this was a perfect gift for a number of my male friends. (I don't now own a copy.)  There were as many women in the sold out audience at the Film Fest last spring laughing as hard as we all were. It's not the sorta thing a man buys a woman for a gift-- well not me. But it is hilarious.  I truly thought this film would get a major release; I never heard further of it. It appeared on the racks of DVD vendors in October I think. It's bathroom-- cut the euphemism-- toilet humor.  The film is about Kenny, who narrates in Aussie (English subtitles so you don't miss a word) English this mockumentary of a ""Sanitation"" man (he provides porta-potties) to major sports,Rock shows and other large events-- it's Australia I'm sure.
The engaging performance of the actor portraying Kenny and the delightfully (I did say that) scripted 'tome' he delivers throughout is (I will not say 'delicious')bright, funny.
The film and Kenny never (here I go again) stoop so low as to be as tasteless as my 'delicious' word use. Having grown up in the midwest in the age of dinosaurs, bathroom humor supplanted any suggestion or mention of sex; I left all the ""beans"" humor behind long ago, and I will crudely embarrass myself again by saying this film KENNY I found refreshing and very, very  funny.  The guys I gave this DVD to have all responded and quoted lines to me.  It worked!  It's not great film art, but there's a wonderfully honest picture of a blue collar worker who sees through the crap (literally) and at another level, much the way W.C. Fields in those 1930's brilliant comedies tolerated fools, jerks and ..turds.  Gibbs Murray",1229299200,,2076,4.529411764705882
3511052,5,B001CDR1F6,"It's no wonder Shane Jacobson won best actor in Australia for this film. The Jacobson's have created a wonderful character that is easy to love in spite of what he does and those around him. Kenny is an absolutely brilliant film that in the hands of lesser filmmakers could have easily become a rather silly film. However, you genuinely come to like this guy, and it's a shame it's only a character. I would love to sit down and have a beer with Kenny.

For Americans, to really appreciate this film, be sure to turn on subtitles. Kenny's genuine accent can be a bit hard to understand (I am sure Aussies understand), but you get so much more out of the film.",1228694400,,659,4.401639344262295
3511053,5,B001CDR1F6,"This movie stands on its own as just entertaining . However, if you want a moral it would be that it is important to take pride in yourself and how well you do what you do and just what you do is secondary .",1225152000,,207,3.727272727272727
3511054,3,B001CDR1F6,"An Australian indie film, 'Kenny' has us following in the boots of an easy-going port-o-rental worker whose day-to-day struggle is more than about filth as it about people's attitudes.  Filled with empathy and good humor, the title character (a lisping Shane Jacobson) frames the prima donnas he meets who easily show how much people take for his indispensable (sorry!) work for granted.  There's a lot of poop to contend in his life (in more ways than one), but the film takes an even keel when Kenny goes to a bathroom rental convention in Nashville, Tennessee where he meets a warm and engaging stewardess.  Yes, there's potty humor for sure, but so much more!

3511055,5,B001CDR1F6,"We rented this dvd from Netflix and for the first few minutes of the story thought it was a documentary.  Kenny is a very appealing character who warms your heart more and more throughout the movie.  I recommend using the subtitles to enjoy the down under dialogue even more. I absolutely have to purchase two copies, one for me and one for my brother in law who thoroughly enjoys anal humor.  Thanks Kenny!",1223683200,,407,4.5479452054794525
3511056,4,B001CDR1F6,"""Kenny"" was a big hit in Australia, where it was made by the Jacobson brothers: Clayton, who writes, directs, and produces, and Shane, who writes, produces, and stars as Kenny Smyth, port-a-potty man. This s a mockumentary deliberately made to look amateurish, so it doesn't' suffer for its low budget and handheld camera. The brothers' father Ronald Jacobson and Clayton's wife and son are in the film as well, so it seems like a family project. Kenny is an unassuming, easy-going employee of Splashdown, a company that furnishes ""corporate bathroom rentals"". He speaks frankly about the life and work of a man who plumbs poo for a living to a documentary film crew that follows him to all kinds of events that need potties and, finally, to a big Pumper and Cleaner Expo in the USA.

I don't think I've ever seen a greater burden put on one actor to carry a movie. Kenny is at the center of every scene. His blunt talk and surprisingly good nature combine to make him a lovable working class hero. Director Clayton Jacobson has found a way to get good dialogue in a loosely scripted film, and that is to tell the actors what the character says in general terms and let them put it in their own words. Shane Jacobson is a veteran of the stage and conveys an almost hyper-genuineness in his manner and speech. Many of the other actors are non-professionals. And Splashdown is a real company. Its owner really is Glenn Preusker, and we see real employees in the film. Kenny's not real, but his friendliness and gift for understatement are enormously appealing.

The DVD (Xenon 2008): There are 16 deleted scenes, a theatrical trailer, 4 featurettes, and an audio commentary. ""The Making of Kenny"" (44 min) is a full-featured documentary that interviews the Jacobsons, their family, cast, and others about the film and its appeal, from the project's conception to its warm reception in Australia. ""Post Production"" (5 min) is about editing and recording the sound. ""Directing in Nashville"" (9 min) joins the cast and crew filming in the US. The director talks about working with non-actors and filming on locations. ""Shootin the Sh*% with the Cast and Crew"" (6 min) are outtakes. The audio commentary is with Clayton Jacobson and Shane Jacobson in the character of Kenny, so it is a sort of continuation of the film. The film is optionally subtitled in English to help with the accents and the fact that Kenny slurs a bit.",1223251200,5,2419,4.757142857142857
3511057,5,B001CDR1F6,"I was fortunate to take a trip to Australia after this film had been released. One of the people there told me this mocumentary was the best example of Australians he knew. He also said many Australians believed Kenny was an actual person because the porta-potty company for which he works is a real company in Australia.

I was mesmerized from the start.

If you like the TV series ""Dirty Jobs"" you are going to thoroughly enjoy this movie!

Kenny is a classy guy who takes pride in his not-so-classy job. I'm thrilled I can finally add this movie to my DVD collection!",1221782400,12,570,4.514563106796117
3511058,5,B001CDR1F6,"I saw Kenny earlier this year in Australia, and found it completely delightful.  I was skeptical at first -- many mockumentary characters are vapid, worthless imbeciles who serve only as whetstones for the writers to sharpen their sarcasm on, headcases with no self-awareness and even less personal appeal.

Kenny is just the opposite.  He is a decent, ordinary bloke with a son who's not sure what to think of him, a father who's out-and-out ashamed of him, and a job that's thankless in the extreme... but he handles every turn with humor, grace, and some very sturdy work gloves.

Somehow amidst a plot full of absurd toilet humor (that somehow manages never to be crass) and riotously funny fish-out-of-water scenes, this movie made me a bit teary-eyed.  It's a human film from start to finish, with comedy and pathos enough to satisfy even the most jaded movie-goer.",1220745600,9,871,4.8979591836734695

3511062,5,B001CDR1F6,"The Australian persona is well represented in this mockumentary of life as a portable toilet plumber, which protagonist Kenny achieves with his likable and larrikin ways. He probably sets a higher example for all Australians to take note of as he rarely complains, makes the best of his situation, and is very considerate of others. A portable toilet will never look the same or be underappreciated after seeing it from Kenny's point of view.

As it is filmed in Australia, I found the subtitles useful and entertaining as well. This is certainly a view into an otherwise unfamiliar landscape. Very well done and quite funny to see this side of events which require these services. Not for everyone, it's pretty organic! :-)",1453248000,2,445,4.575

3511084,2,B001CDR1F6,"We gave this movie every chance.  It seemed to be trying to be a ""documentary"" (although a ""tongue-in-cheek"" one at that), but the humor was gross, of course, or just missed the mark.  I know a LOT of people agree with me, but I just want to be as honest as possible in my review.  Please give us credit for sitting through this movie to the end hoping that something interesting would happen.  ""Kenny"" just wasn't for us.",1382140800,,422,4.371794871794871

3511090,4,B001CDR1F6,"Plenty of comedies, in a moment of desperation, have turned to the occasional poop joke to elicit laughs.  But an ENTIRE film based on nothing BUT scatological humor?  Well, that's something else again.  But that's exactly what we get with ""Kenny,"" an Australian mockumentary about a professional plumber who provides and maintains porta potties for large-scale outdoor events. What's surprising is how endearing a subject excrement can become when placed in the right hands.

In this case, those hands belong to comedian Shane Jacobson, who both wrote the screenplay and plays Kenny Smyth, a dude who remains relentlessly cheerful, optimistic and good-natured in the face of all the crap (both literal and figurative) that life throws at him.  And he is so shrewd and wry in his insights into human nature that he emerges as nothing short of a philosopher/poet for the common man.

In the end, the movie itself becomes a moving and uplifting paean to the dedicated worker who takes pride in his job, and who demonstrates that pride by doing it better than anyone else - no matter what it happens to be.

""Kenny"" might have been even better had it been an actual documentary about a real person - but we'll settle for artfully crafted facsimile this time around.",1356825600,,1262,4.896713615023474

Kenny is a portable-toilet plumber in Australia working for Splashdown, a company supplying portaloos to large outdoor and corporate events.  He is a positive guy, proud of his work, the go-to guy for all kinds of shit (literal and otherwise).

But whatever life throws at him, this decent Australian everyman keeps his chin up and his humour intact and carries on calmly with his unmentionable trade. 100 minutes in Kenny's company is time well spent.

3511096,4,B001CDR1F6,"By the end of this film, you'll love this guy. Kenny appears to be a bit rough around the edges but he is a funny person that leads a unique lifestyle installing port-a-loos. The humor is mostly toilet related humor but it's understated and mostly revolves around the way people stereotype him and the strange situations that his job gets him into (saving the port-a-loos from Nascar fans).

The interviews with Kenny are very candid and his support cast are great. I especially liked Kenny's relationship with his family and how they give him so much strife about ""not having a real job"" and he just takes it. It certainly makes his romance with the flight attendant who accepts him for who he is, more genuine. Overall, this is an uplifting one to see.",1320710400,,754,4.626865671641791

I absolutely love everything about this movie and have yet to meet anyone who doesn't also love it.",1306281600,,415,5.117647058823529
3511099,4,B001CDR1F6,"Australia makes arguably the worst, least entertaining, most anti-mainstream audience movies in the world right now. So it's no suprise this comedy hit was independently funded completely outside the poisonous aussie film industry system. And Kenny is easily the best Aussie comedy in 10 years. If your going to make a film about a toliet plumber this is the way to do it. A simple, well told feel good movie with charming characters. Plus it's bloody hilarious!! Gags galore and trenchant character humour make 'Kenny' a riot.

It's all driven by a brilliant performance by Shane Jacobsen as 'Kenny' not only does he pump out the terrific one liners with great comic timing, he's got the kind of appeal that instantly charms an audience.

Also brilliant is Kenny's ghastly old father (Played by Shane's father Ron-right up there with such nightmare screen dad's as Frank Costanza, Frank Barone and Cotton Hill) he's a bitter old curmugeon who'd be utterly detestable if it weren't for the fact the fact that he's also damn funny.

And Kenny's co-workers are a bunch of all too familiar eccentrics that provide plenty of laughs and some killer slapstick. Just to top it off
there's a nice romantic subplot that's deftly handled.

The plot is probably a little thin in places, but it doesn't matter a hoop, Kenny's one of the only recent Aussie movies that is a sure fire crowd pleaser. More please.",1301961600,,1398,4.861344537815126
3511100,5,B001CDR1F6,"Interesting that reviewers have been touting the incredibly funny humor in the film Kenny, but I found it to be more poignant than comedic.  Kenny is funny, sure, but he's also a decent bloke trying to make an honest living, and he carries himself with a certain amount of dignity and grace as he goes about his job.  We should all try to be more like Kenny.  He knows his job is distasteful to just about everybody, but he refuses to apologize for it or feel belittled by his choice of profession.  After all, he performs a valuable service, that let's face it, everybody is going to need sooner or later.

Kenny handles his ex-wife and mean-spirited father with an almost zen-like calm, as well as annoying co-workers and whiny, uppity people at public events (where he's working).  The acting is so top-notch, I really believed I was watching a documentary all the way through, I just couldn't believe that Kenny wasn't the real deal.  Also, the convention in Nashville was a real convention, wasn't it?  I don't see how they could have arranged all those companies together on the apparently low budget of the film.

He is a man with a sincere, gentle manner and he puts his heart into his work--even though almost no one (including his father and brother) respects what he does for a living. Kennie delivers some hilarious lines in the most deadpan serious way. You'll be surprised by the wonderful story line woven into this mockumentary on the porta-loo business in Australia. I don't think it's suitable for children. The language is pretty colorful along with a few surprise scenes that I wouldn't let my children see. Still, this is one of my top favorite movies of all time and it's one I can watch again and again (unusual for me). Be sure to watch the Extras on the DVD after the movie.

He covers everything from divorce, fatherhood, family conflicts, to death, and employee relations. He is an honest, straightforward, simple guy who just wants to do a good job for people and be treated with respect. ""Kenny"" is a hilariously funny movie with a heart.

Thoroughly recommend it.",1236211200,,419,4.928571428571429

I thought it would be really silly, but it's a heartfelt story of Kenny - one of those really good men who no one appreciates.  I liked it much more than I expected and for a different reason.",1231891200,,261,3.9056603773584904
3511108,5,B001CDR1F6,"we didn't know it wasn't a ""real"" documentary until the end. loved it! funny, sweet, very entertaining.

Kenny was a heck of a great guy. innocent yet wise. this film is a great commentary on people in general. if you like ""people watching"" watch this!

my man Norman and I watched Kenny, totally engrossed from start to finish. we laughed, we nodded in agreement, we rooted for dear big Kenny.

what a great actor! he was so convincing and real. just stunning. I loved his calm, humble interactions with people. how he just took the crap, like with his dad and the customers. he was wonderful!

I never read the DVD box before watching, because I don't want to KNOW a thing. and my strategy paid off, once again. as I was completely delighted by this fun and informative ""documentary.""

see it. so says Gramma Sally.",1231718400,,817,4.568493150684931
3511109,4,B001CDR1F6,"I must admit, when I first heard of the popularity of this 'mockumentary' movie I was a bit skeptical about seeing it because of the humour it would employ. However, when I finally took the plunge to view it (on tv) I was more than pleasantly surprised. Australians, by and large, despite all the shallow nationalistic rhetoric at times, are devoid of self confidence. Hence, there is an unfortunate tendency towards what is termed here as a cultural cringe. In other words, Australians, rather shallowly, don't like their own stuff, because they think it will be dismissed (as it often is) by outsiders - particularly the British or Americans. I suspect, this movie for the same reason maybe treated likewise at home. It's a pity because, the movie, as many of the reviewers here have pointed out, isn't just about a 'plumber' doing his dirty work, it's about the dignity and good heartedness of a simple man, trying to cope with his life as best as he can in often trying circumstances. To the American reviewers and others, I suggest you don't have to come to Australia to see people like Kenny - and yes, the gems of people like Kenny you can still find from time to time - I'm sure they are right there amongst you in the U.S. or elsewhere.
The toilet jokes throughout the film are used in an understated way, not intended to offend. What comes out best in ""Kenny"" is the character himself, and the contrast of him with the often self centred, superficial people he unfortunately has to deal with. He is a single father, playing an important role in the much maligned business of 'porta loos' (portable toilets en masse for various functions). He has to deal with snobby racegoers, a difficult ex-wife, and fellow employees not always reliable. On top of this, he travels to the U.S. to attend a 'business' convention. There, his wonderment and natural charm with those attending and exhibiting, make him easily likeable. His concern for the safe return to his hotel room of an inebriated Japanese business friend, rather than pursuing a possible romantic interest with the Air Stewardess he met on the flight over, endears his personal qualities even more.  The Air Stewardess (Jackie I think), is the only female role that equates with redeemable qualities. In then end, you know, or at least hope, that the Kennys of this world will somehow make the best of any situation they're in. That's why, the closing scene of his reuniting with Jackie(?) suggest there is hope for the decent.
If you want to see a movie that reinvigorates your faith in the better qualities of people then have a look at ""Kenny"".",1231545600,7,2611,4.725877192982456

I liked it so much I bought it again on DVD in the USA. This movie was just hilarious. Kenny says some of the funniest things and really takes pride in his work. The entire movie was hilarious and every moment had something to laugh about. I would also highly recommend the tv show Kenny's World, just as fun!",1482796800,,443,4.223529411764706
