8328974,1,B001O2SHLM,"The ' Only ' Reason(s) I Completed Watching This Film Was, I Paid... And Maybe Hoping It Would Amount It 'Be Worthy""... NOT, The Movie Has No Relativity, Authenticity Or Reason. Appears Like The Film Crew Just A Few Young People Together Somewhere/Anywhere,  And Shot Some S*** !",1454112000,,279,4.8125

8328977,2,B001O2SHLM,"This movie is hard to follow. It has very little dialogue, they go on a date and stare at each other the entire time lol. I bought it because of where the movie was shot, in my hometown of st. pete, but it did not live up to my expectations. Different strokes for different folks though",1355788800,,286,4.125
8328978,1,B001O2SHLM,"One of the worst films I've ever seen.  A disappointement to the Indie Film community.  Horrible monologues, no story line, very little talking and very little symbolism and subtlety to make up for the lack of speaking roles in the film.  Get with it and move your audience!!!!  This film is silly and boring.",1306108800,,309,4.666666666666667
8328979,3,B001O2SHLM,"This is a great movie and one I was very much looking forward to buying on DVD. However, the DVD is not enhanced for widescreen TVs. So you either have to watch it at half the size in the middle of your screen or blow it up, with makes the already fuzzy picture (16mm) even fuzzier. Kind of hard to believe that in 2010, when everyone is buying LCDs and plasmas, that Kino could actually release something like this and charge normal DVD price for it. Well, they got me, mainly because there is so little info about this release on the internet. So just be warned, if you have a widescreen HDTV, you are kind of left out of the loop on this one. Unfortunately, a film as small as this may never be released again. That's a shame, because it is truly worth watching.",1264204800,2,765,4.2465753424657535
8328980,5,B001O2SHLM,If you like arthouse/indie films then you will love this. I first heard about this after reading the rave review in the NY Times. Been anxious to get the DVD ever since. This film really deserves more recognition!,1263168000,,213,4.631578947368421
8328981,1,B001O2SHLM,Yes.  Get with the program Amazon!  Get this movie and get it NOW!!!,1250812800,,68,4.153846153846154
8328982,4,B001O2SHLM,"Read the rave review this film got in the New York Times on it's very limited (NYC and LA) release last month, and just now thought I'd look online to see if it was in my area or already out on disc or what. So what is up with ""This item has been discontinued by the manufacturer""?",1250380800,,281,3.9473684210526314
