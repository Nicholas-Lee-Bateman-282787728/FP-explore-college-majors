1951113,5,B0000VCZK2,"Ok, for those of you who don't know what this Quadrilogy is, it is simply the 25th anniversary edition of the films. This boxset has the newest version of Alien: Directors cut, Aliens: Special Edition, Alien 3, and Alien Resurection. The first two Alien movies were the best in my opinion and last two were somewhat lacking in what made this seris so popular amoung Sci-Fi freaks in the first place. This item should be available for purchase before this Christmas and will be packaged in a boxset similar to the Alien Legacy. For those of you who have the Alien Legacy you are the lucky few who will be able to remember what the original version of the film looked like. For those of you who waited to grab the Alien Legacy (bet you are punching yourselves) here is your chance to own some of the best Sci-Fi movies that have ever been made. Pick this boxset up, you'll be pleased, I promise. 'Nuff said",1067644800,4,904,4.451807228915663

Alien: Resurrection is maybe not good in the way the others are, but it's definitely a guilty-pleasure for me.  I say this was definitely worth the purchase.",1510704000,,446,4.45679012345679

I'll post another review once bluray's are examined. IMHO, Alien and Alien Resurrection were the best- resurrection because of Call..

11/16/2017
Alien 5 should be made with Ripley and Call, perhaps where Aliens reach earth somehow, and other androids of call type are on earth.

1951285,3,B0000VCZK2,"With some flaws, it's still a GREAT buy for all that you get!

PRO'S:
Film transfers are really good, if not great. The DTS sound is also really good.
As for extras, Disc 6 is AWESOME, with archival footage from the laserdisc extras to storyboards, and tons more!

CON'S:
Sometimes I had to unplug & reset my blu ray player to get some of the discs to play.
Disc 5 of the extras is SO blurry it's a complete disaster of a transfer! If you have the DVD versions, stick with those!
I already exchanged the set with Amazon, but the 2nd set for Disc 5 was the same. The reps at Amazon were REALLY understanding, and documented the situation.

Discs 1-4 review (2 versions of each film):
* I viewed the extended versions of each film, except Alien because I found the addded scenes just slowed the pacing too much.

Disc 1- Alien:
As for picture clarity, you can see just about every pore & sweatdrop! There is some blur left in the picture, but I'm guessing that's for effects reasons. Overall, the transfer is great picture & DTS sound!

Disc 2- Aliens:
I choose the 'Special Edition' version because I like the extra footage added to the film.  For the 'added scenes' the volume is a little lower than the rest of the film, but it's not too bad. The picture clarity is good, although a little lower than Alien at times, but still pretty good. I thought the DTS sound to be a bit better than Alien.

Disc 3- Alien3:
In the DVD version they added the deleted scenes dialouge with subtitles because of very poor dubbing.
In this blu ray version the dialouge has been  restored to a complete 'Director's version'' witth no subtitles, which is really nice- although (like in Aliens) at times the dialouge does need some 'boosting', and is at a lower volume than the rest of the film. The color is a bit washed out a times, the effects really need a boost- too mush rotoscoping & shadow to be realistic. I liked how you get 2 versions of the Alien's birth too.
All in all not a bad film to the series, although a bit slow on the pacing at times. The DTS was good all in all.

Disc 4- Resurrection:
The lease impressive of the transfers for picture- a lot of the time it's dark & grainy, It's better than the DVD, but still looks like it needs color correction. The DTS sound is very good, though.

U[date for Disc 5- I called Fox Customer Care and explained the situation to the representative.
She said they didn't have any complaints from anyone, and their policy was to offer an exchange (the full set for a full set), which can take weeks.
I just decided to keep it, since I have all of Disc 5 on my double DVD set of movies.",1509235200,,2621,4.319755600814664

The one I received was a Canadian territory version that was sold in the U.S. Because of this, I could not use the codes for the digital version to add to my library. I was able to determine this by calling Fox who pulled up the UPC barcode.

1951582,1,B0000VCZK2,"This review is for the Alien Anthology box set, not the Alien Quadrilogy.

I've gone through 3 of these now and they've all had very scratched up discs. I think this is because of the way they're packaged. The discs are tight in cardboard sleeves so that when you pull them out they rub against the rough cardboard. Now why they're scratching so easily is another question, Blu-Rays are typically very scratch resistant. I've actually tested this out on some Blu-Rays before and couldn't even scratch them with my fingernails, I had to use sharp metal. So I think the issue here might be less the cardboard packaging and more an issue with the coating on the discs. Just get the quadrilogy set if all you care about are the movies because that's in a normal blu-ray case. If you want the additional material then I guess you're out of luck.",1496016000,,840,4.562913907284768

1951607,5,B0000VCZK2,"This Blu-Ray collection is excellent. There are 4 movie discs & 2 discs of extras. Each movie disc contains the original & SE movies.
For the $25 I spent, I couldn't ask for anymore.

However the the paper product book/case was poorly constructed & the double cardboard like pages/disc holders easily separated. I minimized that issue by wrapping the pages close to the spine with clear packaging tape.

I saw a scratches and smudges on literally all the discs....luckily the first one is playing but it did take some time for my PS4 to even read it.....anyways Ill update if any of the other 3 discs fail due to scratches and random finger smudges....like come on...still a steal for 30 I suppose.

1951640,5,B0000VCZK2,"Be careful which version your buying, as amazon mixes the reviews. For example, people complained about not getting the 2 extra disks, but the Alien Quadriology only includes the 4 blue ray disks, both extended and theatrical versions only as one guy pointed out. Its the Alien Anthology That has the 2 extra disks. I must say the presentation of the box is quite nice. Each blue ray disk is in its own special sleeve along with the illustration of that movie. It also has codes for all the alien movies to be viewed digitally and a code for a sneak peek at aliens covenant. But man the really stuffed this thing tight in the box itself, you almost have to shake it out. I really like the aliens series, and this Anthology collection is great for any alien fan.

1951643,5,B0000VCZK2,"This is one of my favorite  franchises.  One of the few out there were the sequel was as good as the first (the rest were all mediocre, but I still enjoyed them).  I've had the first 4 on DVD for a long time now, but someone said they wanted to see Alien for a movie night.  So I searched, and to my surprise found 4 of them with 2 extended versions for just $15!  (I would have rather had it in 4k, but it's not out there yet).  Alien may be one of the scariest, most suspenseful films made (haven't watched the directors cut yet).  It's follow up, Aliens, is one of my favorite movies. It falls more into the ""action"" category than ""suspense"" (which is more my cup of tea).  If you've seen it 100 times like I have, you get something from the directors cut.  Gives you a little more insight into character development (don't want to spoil anything).  The other two films are ok, but not nearly as good as the first two.  They are both watchable, but really don't stand up to the first two (I enjoyed resurrection more than 3).  If you haven't seen these, for $15, it's a must buy!  Then if you really like it, you can get all the others (AVP, AVP Requiem, Prometheus, and now Covenant).",1493769600,,1188,4.226666666666667

Having the director's say a few words about their special releases was also a nice inclusion to this anthology. Speaking of 'special editions', Alien 3 was like watching an entirely different movie, as many scenes were completely different than what was shown at the theaters (SPOILER: the one that surprised me the most was when the Alien was first 'born': in the theater version it was 'born' from a dog, a Rottweiler; in the special edition, another animal was used).

The Extended Cut of Alien is a joke, as even Ridley Scott has admitted that the ONLY reason he created it was because the studio pressured him into it. It suuuucks too, existing as a curiosity and nothing more. The ONLY version of Alien 3 I will watch is the Extended Cut - the theatrical version is a convoluted mess and horrible editing choices. Alien 4 is just a mess no matter what, but at least the extended cut adds some scenes of depth for the Ripley clone and a slightly more rewarding ending.

It's hard to describe the impact when no one knew what was coming and it had never been done before. The other aspect that made a huge impact was that finally there was a primo sci-fi/horror flick with a heroic WOMAN as the protagonist, someone with know-how and daring who knew how to survive.  I decided to buy  the Quadrilogy to ensure that I always have a copy of these suspense-filled stories.
And so I found the title - looked right - but was frankly astounded to see that it is marketed as starring Harry Dean Stanton and Tom Skerrit?? Seriously?? Who are they, anyway? I know some of the other ads correctly list Sigourney Weaver as the star, but this is not the first time I've seen her name left off entirely. Amazing, given that she IS the movie.

1952075,4,B0000VCZK2,"Alien Quadrilogy 4 DISC blu-ray, verified purchaser. First, I am a huge fan ever since I saw Alien the first night it hit the theaters in '79 and will leave the actual movie details to others. This Alien Quadrilogy is the 4 Alien movies, each with the theatrical and extended editions only, No extra disks, the only extras would be what was included in the single blu ray releases. This presentation is in a thin line snap case, not a cardboard box. Now that I got that out of the way, here are my 2 complaints: First, since Amazon, for years being completely incapable of separating the reviews of all the different Alien releases (as so with with ALL other releases).the reviews below are mixed with ALL the different releases of the franchise and who, except for the most knowledgeable of this franchise, can tell the difference? Maybe we, as reviewers, should identify what it is we are actually reviewing, to help others. Hence, the 1 star ding. Second, specifically to this QUADRILOGY, the product details correctly identify this as 4 disks, which is correct, however, the Editorial review incorrectly claims 2 extra disks of over 50 hours of extras which is WRONG. Those extra disks are in the blu ray release of the Alien ANTHOLOGY, NOT this Quadrilogy. The transfers of the films themselves are the same as ALL other blu ray releases, no matter what the release is called (30th anniversary, Anth, Quad, single release, etc, all the SAME) and I have no issue with that. I believe this is as good as it will ever get, even some future possible 4K cant undo the limitations inherent in the technology used in the original filming. As I said, big fan here, but be aware that you are likely reading a review for a future purchase that is not what you will be buying. Unfortunately, it looks like Amazon will never over come this massive inability, so life goes on. If all you want is the extended cuts of the 4 movies and are not interested in all the extras, for $15, This is easily the best deal you're going to get. And no HD downloads here either. Just FYI.....
8/24/17 update. As more and more 4K reviews are showing up, Amazon, STILL shows 4 K's as ""blu-ray"" without distinction. Sad...",1476748800,315,2196,4.604591836734694

1952114,5,B0000VCZK2,Love this franchise however the 1986 version of Aliens is not correct. I saw it in 86 i also was a rep for the 3nd largest distributor in the eastern US and i can tell you this is not the 86 verdion. If you watch the 1990 version it is closest with the missing 22 minutes from the original video release . After CBS played the original 86 version on tv ( believe it or not) video stores were so mad they had to release the original to stop the law suits. What this disc has is the firts video release on vhs from around late 87.,1475280000,,528,3.94392523364486

1952215,4,B0000VCZK2,"When this wonderful 9disc quadrilogy released in 2003  two discs per movie + one addressing the whole franchise  as big a fan as Ive been over the past 37 years, I already had these films in special & standard editions. But this past month I decided it was time to acquire a used copy (eBay) to finally see the extended Assembly Cut for Alien3. Not to be considered a Directors Cut as David Fincher had a massive falling out with 20th Century Fox while creating this film, it is so much more than just added scenes, in many ways its almost a different movie.

Let me first admit that Ive never been a fan of either Alien3 or Resurrection. When they killed off Newt & Hicks (Billie & Wicks) they instantly lost credibility. So is this a better film, its hard to say, its definitely more interesting if a bit slower, and as much as I loathe reviewers telling me something is a must, if you are a real fan of the franchise this is worth checking out. As prison Warden Andrews would say, this is rumor control, here are the facts. I took the time to watch the theatrical version again before sitting down a couple nights later to the expanded edition. Here are my amateur observations, and if you desire a more literal *spoilerlaced* interpretation I would then direct you to 2003 Assembly Cut, Alien3 on Wikipedia.

This Amazon listing refers to run time as 155 minutes while Wikipedia lists it at 10 minutes less. Both websites agree that the theatrical version was 114 minutes so figure on getting 30 to 40 minutes of additional content.

First off, some of the deleted scenes didn't get the post production audio upgrades and a few subtitles are inserted making them more understandable. There is much more footage of the creature, which does not incubate in a Dog but in another 4legged member of Fury 161. The beginning is altered & expanded upon, there is a sizable section on capturing the beast, and so much more character development amongst the inmates. I believe the musical scoring has changed and the religious overtones definitely heighten the overall feeling of apocalypse for these fateful faithful inmates.

And here we may have some insight into the falling out between the Director & 20th Century Fox. Whereas the theatrical release never justified the death of Newt & Hicks, which felt hollow & cheap, this extended edition shows a much more artistically calculated risk, which I can appreciate. Better movie? Definitely different, and worth the time. One last thing, only one inmate survived this movie & a recently released hardcover Alien: The WeylandYutani Report has a neat 8page insert that is supposed to be excerpted from a book this fictional inmate wrote about his Fury 161 experience. It is titled Space Beast, which I believe was the first working name of the original Alien.",1468627200,2,2804,4.735655737704918
1952216,5,B0000VCZK2,Well this is not my first time seeing the special edition of the alien triliogy it is my first time on blue ray because i accidently threw away my nine disc quad special edition on dvd but what the hell i have blue ray so i bought the anthology and it was money well spent. Now just so you know every thing is still the same if you go from dvd special edition to blue ray its just worded different like aliens is the 1991 special edition not the 2003 special edition like it said on dvd. But please enjoy oh one last thing if you hated the third and fourth film watch the directors cut its a totally different film nothing like the original at all.,1468540800,,648,4.110236220472441

1952218,5,B0000VCZK2,"Alien and Aliens are hands down my favorite sci-fi movies of all time, so I may be a bit biased, but this is one of the best Blu-Ray sets I own.

PROS:
-Beautiful packaging, small and subtle, gorgeous artwork inside, won't stick out of your collection, but will *stand* out.
-Blu-Ray transfer is GORGEOUS, especially in Alien.  You'll have a scene on the Nostromo with the characters in the foreground and the picture is so crisp and clear you can read the screen readouts on the computer monitors down the hall.  Every inch of the sets, the costumes, and the special effects are amazingly sharp.
-Audio is fantastic.  I'm not an audiophile, but I felt it was very clear and balanced, never felt the dialogue was washed out for the action.
-TWO whole discs of making-of, behind the scenes, and artwork featurettes.  None of these feel like cheap padding to fill out a collector's edition.  All of the featurettes are interesting and informative.
-Excellent menu system
-Theatrical AND Director's Cuts of both Alien and Aliens.  Alien has a bit more footage, but Aliens has a full 18 mins extra, including a lot of added depth and backstory for a few of the main characters.

CONS:
-Contains Alien 3
-Contains Alien: Resurrection.",1468108800,,1229,4.791469194312796

1952322,4,B0000VCZK2,"I specifically ordered product ASIN: B001AQO3QA
But I received the Ireland boxed library book set with the symbol of 18 on the front, with a code of X000RD7XMJ on the wrapper.
On one hand, this might be valued by others as a nicer collection to sit on a shelf or in a box. Its the Blu-Ray case inside a sort of fancy cardboard book sleeve.
On the other hand, in the ""Live Extras"" category it searches the internet for extras but states that they are not available for my region. Since viewing the material is the utility I actually purchased the Blu-Ray for, it upsets me that I can not utilize this feature in my 'region'. Perhaps just being denied something that is not there is an insult enough.

But mostly I'm bothered that Amazon lumps all 30+ versions of these randomized movie sets into a single item, where it really becomes a crap shoot of what item the seller is actually selling. I read a lot of reviews that clearly stated they were reviewing specifically a certain set, nearly all of the reviews are for different sets, and I started to realize that if I was going to get this 6 disc set for thirty bucks that I was going to have to trust the amazon ordering system to somehow give me what I wished for. Obviously I did not get the item advertised in the picture. (No 18 in the pic.) After talking with my brother, I realized the reason the Irish version is being sent out is that Ireland has the least corporate tax of all the nations.

On to the movies... severe spoilers if you haven't seen the movies ever.
Alien:
I just finished watching the 2003 director's cut of Alien, I watched it first, and although the picture quality is extremely superb, I also wish the set had the version with crappy film grain quality. With such perfect resolution, my teenagers saw the alien hiding instantly, where in the first version (being so grainy) it was still kind of hidden in the machinery and a shocker when you realize its starting to move. The one time the alien jump scares you, its laughable since you clearly see it poses in the same hysterical pose from all the movies and video games, which is not reaching at you, but actually a jester's pose or spirit fingers. The worst part is when Ash's head is removed and they clearly cut the film and replace the prop head with the actor's head, there is an actual gap in film footage. There was no moving a human across the scene to stop the disbelief. It was just ""here's a movie prop"", then black footage, ""now here's the real actor's talking head"". This seems out of character for the movie since so much work seemed to go into the face hugger's skin, coloring, and details and fleshy under mass, and Ash's face with his blood cleverly painted and splashed on, right down to the details of the alien's metal teeth.

I would really like to see a version where it became grainy when an alien was in the scene, or even when the crew could not see well due to being in a space suit or being too dark. The movie was so clear that I am beginning to wonder if the original film grain was an aftereffect for the first movie. haha... It would be really neat if you could mark certain scenes to being grainy or not, then watch the complete movie as you have marked it.

Anyway, I was hoping it would be a memorably scary movie for my teenagers, but seemed to be a laugh fest during. But at least after the movie, it was too scary to watch the second film for them. So... maybe it wasn't so horrible after all. I'll have to watch the theatrical version to see if the same mistakes are so horribly obvious.",1461974400,,3555,4.357466063348416

1952435,5,B0000VCZK2,"Amazon combines all movie reviews together, rather than to specific products, so I ended up pretty confused as to which Quadrilogy I was actually buying. Plus, I paid $18 for it and then checked back a few days later and it was only $10just my luck.

Anyway, this review is for the 4-Disc DVD Quadrilogy with half the alien face on the cover.  I was under the impression that this set contained 2 versions of each film: The theatrical cut and a special edition.  However, not the case with this set.  It has the theatrical release for A1, A3, and A4, but a special edition of A2.  This was disappointing since on the 9-Disc Quadrilogy set, BOTH versions of the film were on a single DVD disc.
I'm not too bummed about missing out on the 50 hours worth of special features since I simply don't have time to invest in watching all that.

If you just want a bare bones DVD set of the Alien films I would recommend this for $10. If you want all the bonus features and duel versions of each filmsmake sure you are buying the correct set since they all apparently have the same name: Quadrilogy

Before getting this set I was unfamiliar with Alien3 and Alien Resurrection.  I know a lot of fans strongly dislike A3 so it's pointless to heap on more criticism, so I will just say it was one of the most unpleasant and abysmal sequels ever.  Thankfully Alien Resurrection flat-out ruled! The cloned Ripley is also fascinating to watch, and not just because she looks almost exactly like Glenn Danzig.  The acclaimed french director Jeunet seemed determined to beat Cameron at his own game: Not only does it surpass Aliens in terms of killer action, but steals some thunder from Titanic with stunning underwater sequences.",1457913600,8,1713,4.568627450980392

The stories behind Alien3 and Resurrection, are very interesting, probably more interesting than their respective films, but hearing the tales from the sets does add appeal to these films.

You pull out a book which has thick pages with high quality pictures from each movie and then certain pages with sleeve cut outs where the discs are stored. It's really a nice unique way to package all of the contents instead of using regular old plastic cases. There's also lots of bonus features which I'm slowly working my way thru, savoring every moment as I've never seen any bonus features from any of the movies before.

I say somewhat as the Blu Ray would play, BUT, the disc menus were not available and the discs would not play normally. As such, Aliens would only play the theatrical versions and I only like the extended version because it's far superior to the theatrical version (it is, deal with it).

After have the item in my basket for quite some time I noticed the price had decreased and finally decided to take the plunge and make the purchase.

The item was well packaged and arrived safely with no damage, unlike two of my other parcels ordered on amazon I had received in the past. On opening the box the noticed the standard packaging, with the safety plastic to keep everything in place while in transit. Although a little smaller than I thought, the egg has a total height of +/-24.5cm (9.65inches).

The Blu-Ray discs are securely stored in the base in a nice booklet type case, and the artwork looks really amazing. The egg also lights up really nicely and uses 2x AA/LR6 1.5v batteries (included).

Get this set and binge it with new eyes as if for the first time.  The video is crisp and clear and the sound is fantastic.  I have a friend who is a theatre expert, both audio and video, and he recommend this set because I like real science fiction and I have a great TV and a HSU sound system that puts me into the scene.

1952964,5,B0000VCZK2,"When Alien first came out many years ago I was much younger and I found the movie pretty scary.  The second movie, Aliens, has always been my favourite as Sigourney plays Ellen Ripley, a tough, smart pilot who can really kick alien butt.
The aliens in this story are tough, smart, and weaponized.  They are more than a match for manpower and weapons but Ripley is a fast learner as she struggles to stay alive.
Every time an Alient movie would came on the air I would watch it.  When VCRs came around I bought the set and now of course I have the DVDs.
This is a series of movies that any sci-fi lover will really enjoy.  I watch the whole series every other year or so and enjoy it every time.  I highly recommend the whole set.",1438128000,,729,4.215827338129497
1952965,5,B0000VCZK2,"ALIEN!!!!!!  I mean its a classic.  It's been copied over and over because its a great format and in my opinion still holds up as a great film.  I didn't think I would like it when I first saw it because I don't like horror films, and I found out I do like horror films I just don't like the gore of most horror films.  This blue ray set has all 4 alien movies, only movie left out is Prometheus (I believe they released a version with Prometheus for their 35th anniversary but I cant find it anywhere online).  But Prometheus was 4.99 on blue ray when I bought this so I went ahead and got that too.  This has commentary for each film as well as two versions of each film, the original and the updated re-release they've done of each one over the years.  I doubt this is actually in 1080p (when I was looking at them individually in the store they weren't 1080p).  Worth having in any Blueray collection since it doesn't look like a higher quality version is going to be released.",1438128000,,981,4.236559139784946

1953269,1,B0000VCZK2,"This item was mislabled.  While it is in fact the Alien Anthology, it is an import, and is stamped by the Irish Film Association.  As a result, the disks were not immediately playable.  I put them into my blu-ray player and the screen went black and then froze up.  I turned it off and then back on again, and my blu-ray player, a Panasonic, downloaded something and the film worked, but audio did not immediately work either.  I finally got it up and running and then noticed that there were small white and black flecks in the picture.

I popped in several other blu-rays, in an effort to troubleshoot the problem, and found that the Irish discs were the only ones that showed white and black flecks.  I have since tried to replicate the problem and it consistently manifests the same black and white flecks; I have tried it on several different displays and it is always the same.

I have contacted the seller and they promised to refund the purchase price, but stated that: ""We're happy to accept your return, but wanted to help explain a few things to you.  We sells thousands of blu-rays a month, and we can assure you that literally 100% of all Blu-ray issues are the player itself. Samsung and Sony have very limited playbility in general and have the highest incompatibility with various collectible blu-rays. We have literally never seen a single defective blu-ray in over a million sold.  We're happy to accept your return.""  Samsung and Sony have ""very limited playability""?  Really?  The highest volume sellers - worldwide - have ""very limited playability""?  Pfft, as if bro.  Moreover, I have a Panasonic blu-ray player, so not a relevant or factual comment.  And oddly, there is no mention of the ""Irish Film Association"" labeling all over the package.

Also worth note, I have Alien and Aliens on blu-ray - both coded for the U.S. - and neither show any of the artifacts that I noticed while using the Irish version...it is downright bizarre, and I wish that were not the case because I'd love to keep the set, but for $119.00 I am not willing to compromise.  Also, the import issue aside, the seller did provide a brand new unit, sealed in the box - for what its worth.

I responded to the Seller and stated that ""yes, I would like to return it,"" but I have not heard back from the seller since our initial contact.  I will be filing a claim with Amazon to get my money back.",1426377600,3,2392,4.557377049180328
1953270,5,B0000VCZK2,huge alien fan love the trilogy it was amazing when the extended edtion came out and that was fantastic. but when it came out on blu ray with extened cut with bouns disc for each movie. about on the set and the special effects. but it also came with a bouns disc about how alien 3 should of been flimed but over all the picture was amazing and the sound was epic it was scary to watch them all over agian. especially in the dark lol,1426291200,,432,4.034883720930233
1953271,5,B0000VCZK2,"How many movie franchises can stake claim at having achieved such strong cultural significance and a redefinition of their respective genres that even seeing their weakest films can stimulate the imagination? Most franchises don't have that quality, but some of them do - the ""Star Wars"", ""Back to the Future"", ""Indiana Jones"", ""the Lord of the Rings"", ""Harry Potter"", even ""the Matrix"" sagas - all of them whose best movies have emotionally and intellectually resonated with the moviegoers and whose worst movies at least offer sporadic moments of brilliance - say what you want to about ""Star Wars Episode I"", which is admittedly awful, but you can't deny that pod racing sequence was a dazzler. And the car chase in the bloated ""Matrix Reloaded""? Awesome! These movies, no matter their flaws and weaknesses, have become indelible monuments in popular culture - parodied, imitated, paid tribute to, certainly ridiculed but definitely not ignored and certainly never forgotten.

Joining that list of illustrious and indelible landmarks of pop culture is the ""Alien"" saga. Ever since Ridley Scott ripped John Hurt's heart out of his chest with the ferociously scary original, this saga continues to cause reverberations in the world of movies. Much like ""Star Wars"", which was a giant influence on the series, its impact on the public, in terms of storytelling, genre conventions and especially visuals, cannot be underestimated - not just movies, but comic-books, graphic novels, horror shows, video games, even paintings and architecture. if anything, the ""Alien"" saga seem tailor made for Blu-Ray. The details, the tiny nuances, the art direction, the subtle but expressive sound effects and the ruggedness of the human face, which was barely hinted in DVD, could finally be expressed on Blu-Ray and rightly so due to how much the ""Alien"" movies were visceral experiences visually and aurally. That's why the ""Alien Anthology"" was so eagerly anticipated when it came out back in 2009 and expectations were high as to rather the ""Alien"" movies could showcase what Blu-Ray could do in ways that DVD could not.

Now the question remains: is this set we've been waiting for? The answer is a resounding yes. ""Alien"" in particular looks absolutely stunning. The first time I saw it on a big screen, I couldn't believe how much detail I've discovered that I did not in the Quadrilogy DVD set. Just watch the opening sequence where the Nostromo computer awakens in this set and then compare it to the DVD version and the difference in quality and quantity are staggering; you'll discover tiny tidbits that you didn't notice in the DVD set. The blackness lurking within the corridors of the Nostromo no longer look overwhelming dark; there's various shades and shadow detail that make it feel like a retro tug boat, a compressed environment that is appropriate for a group of blue-collar workers to function in. The red blood that pops out of Kane's chest, the orange fire from the flamethrower, the white blood from Ash's carcass and the blue laser light that skims through the fog as Kane discovers the eggs are so strikingly vivid that they immediately stand out, which is what Scott intended. I can't imagine ""Alien"" looking better than it does now on Blu-Ray.

The picture quality in the three sequels are also excellent, albeit not as pristine as ""Alien"". When James Cameron revealed that he was going to de-grain and color correct ""Aliens"", several fans were understandably at arms as they felt this would distort the original look of the films. If there were any such negative changes, I didn't notice and thankfully ""Aliens"" looks exceptionally good and has very, very little of the ruinous plastic waxy look that we all feared it would have (anybody who watches the first Blu-Ray version of ""Patton"" will know what I mean). The fine detail, the balanced black levels, the strong colors and even moments of graininess are still prevalent and I didn't sense any blurriness often associated with DNR.

I could pretty much the say the same for ""Alien 3"" and ""Resurrection"", although both are marginally less impressive. Because both of them are generally disdained by fans, critics and even the studio executives who financed them, it's no surprise these two films doesn't score exceptionally high grades in the picture department. ""Resurrection"" definitely looks the best of the two, only because of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, who is a master at delivering stunning visuals and rich color palette, directed it. Still, the picture qualities for these films are overall very good and definitely a huge improvement over their DVD counterparts. If ""Aliens"" and the other sequels don't offer an impeccable visual presentation like ""Alien"", they are still leaps and bounds over the DVD versions.

Although all four movies differ in picture quality, they all sound equally sublime on audio. You haven't experienced the ""Alien"" saga until you've listened to them on the lossless DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 surround tracks. Holy Cow, was I was blown away? ""Alien"" has an eerie, unsettling sound design that was merely hinted in the DVD, but is stunningly rendered on Blu-Ray. Notice the contrast between the nearly deadening silence in space and the working mechanics operating in the Nostromo. The clanking of chains, the indelible drops of water in the ducts, the operative electronics in the computer system, even the alien's horrific screaming as Ripley tries to kill it in her pod, are pushed to the forefront, giving ""Alien"" an overwhelmingly frightening experience that has most likely never been felt since it was first released in theater. ""Aliens"" (and to a lesser extent, ""Alien: Resurrection"") takes a direct opposite: if ""Alien"" was as subtle as feather, then ""Aliens"" is as blunt as a sledgehammer. Pulsating gunfire, ear-shattering explosions, rampant footsteps and the alien's recognizable shrieking ignite the speakers at maximum volume, giving the impression of a horrific roller-coaster ride that you can't get off of. ""Alien 3"" sounds just as good, but best of all, it fixes many of the audio problems that bogged down the previous DVD copy. I think it's safe to say that ""Alien"" fans can finally retire their DVD copies for this new and improved Blu-Ray set.

But we're not done yet! I haven't even gotten started on the supplements. If you thought the ""Alien Quadrilogy"" on DVD was a monster, wait until you buy ""Alien Anthology"". It would literally take a week just to salvage through these bonus features, ranging from deleted scenes, storyboards, concept sketches to documentaries, production stills, trailer and TV spots, even parodies. As a bonus note, not only are all the DVD supplements from the previous set present, but the ""Wreckage and Rage"" documentary on ""Alien 3"" has been restored to its original length, which shows sections of director David Fincher having conflicts with studio meddling, something that didn't happen in the Quadrilogy set. I can't think of any Alien fan who would be displeased with what this set has to offer.

The ""Alien Anthology"" is not only worth the wait, but worth buying a Blu-Ray player for. If you don't have the set already, what the heck are you waiting for? Stop reading this review and go buy it. If you thought you've fully experienced this saga before, wait till you purchase this set. In space, no one can hear you scream. But in your house, they will certainly hear you jump in joy as you've experienced the ""Alien"" movies like none other.",1426291200,3,7497,5.041129032258064

Something I would like to comment is for fellow latin amercians. The version I got is the imported one, the one that comes from Europe, ironically, that version's subtitles and dubbing are made in latin american spanish, whereas the US version is subtitled and dubbed in spanish from Spain. For us (both, latin americans and spanish people) this makes a huge difference, so I would like this to be very clear. If you want spanish from latin america, buy the imported version (ASIN: B003AQBYUG), and if you want spanish from Spain, buy the US version (ASIN: B001AQO3QA). God knows why they decided to make it this way, but they did. So now you know.

1953458,5,B0000VCZK2,"This review is for the 6-disc Blu-ray anthology imported from the U.K. The current price for this anthology makes it well worth buying versus getting the first two separately. It's generally accepted that ""Alien"" (first film) directed by Ridley Scott was the unique ground-breaking Sci-Fi horror film. The second, directed by James Cameron (of Titanic and Avatar fame), is considered as good as the first. The third film had a very young David Fincher in his directorial debut and the franchise ran into some trouble. It's not Fincher's doing as much as it is the turmoil the production had been in for a long time, compounded by incessant studio executive(s) meddling and overruling numerous Fincher creative decisions. Fincher subsequently directed Seven, The Game, Fight Club, Zodiac, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (U.S. remake), and most recently Gone Girl (not a comprehensive list). Alien3 did not fare that well with the critics but did OK at the box office. The fourth film, Alien: Resurrection was directed by a French director who spoke little English and used a translator. IMHO this was not conducive to efficient or effective film directing, and it shows. It employs a Deus Ex Machina scheme to resurrect Ripley who had killed herself in Alien3. It saw a modest improvement with the critics and also did OK at the box office. Even if the ending of the 4th didn't some finality, It was clear the franchise had exhausted itself. (The Alien vs Predator spin-off from the Alien and Predator franchises hopes to breath some life into the two as a single franchise with its own arc.) The 3rd and 4th are not up to the power of the first two, but they're not complete dogs albeit getting the Ripley arc into the 4th one was contrived.

Bottom Line:
Alien and Aliens (the first two), with Alien3 and Alien: Resurrection as full-length film bonus features, all at a good price, with two additional discs of additional bonus material related to all four films.",1422316800,,2002,4.870967741935484
1953459,5,B0000VCZK2,My favorite sci-fi flick of all time.  Sigourney Weaver was excellent.  She captivated the fear dread and horror of every encounter with the aliens.  She embodied strength and courage and held you spellbound until the very end.,1422230400,,227,5.081081081081081

However, when I ordered from Amazon.com the 'Aliens Quadrilogy on DVD, the weather on my contemporary sound and visual system had completely cleared, and to my absolute surprise, the DVD of the four Aliens Quidrilogy included the scenes that where cut from the theatrical version of the movies ( which is something that needs to happen with Russell Crows acting production of the 'Gladiators').  For several hours I watched everyone of the Aliens Quidrilogy, as if I was watching an entirely new movie  oddly enough it was a new movie  it was a horrifying but beautiful experience in film audience participation which really did surprise me.  I did this in particular, because there is a new version of Aliens to be released soon for movie fanatics like myself  I will be in the theater for sure with this new release of Aliens, I recommend a review of the old productions of Aliens before attending the new release, but please, only on DVD digital visual and sound devices.",1418860800,,1511,4.773076923076923

1953614,5,B0000VCZK2,"(Two Important Notes-
 First: This is a review for the Blu-Ray ""Alien Anthology"" boxed-set.  Amazon seems to have lumped together the reviews of this set with previous boxed-sets.
 Second:  I do not own any prior DVD or Blu-Ray release of the series.  So I cannot compare this set to any prior sets/releases.  This is merely a stand-alone review of this specific boxed-set.)

The ""Alien Anthology"" Blu-Ray boxed sets is one of the most satisfying buying experiences I've had this year as a horror/sci-fi fan.  It's a great value for a collection of great films, and is definitely worth buying for fans who either don't already own the films, or are looking to upgrade their DVD's to Blu-Ray without breaking the bank.

The set includes the first four ""proper"" films from the ""Alien"" franchise (Alien, Aliens, Alien 3, Alien: Resurrection), each with two versions (original theatrical edition and alternate versions), commentary tracks, an interactive viewing mode (""Mu-Th-Ur Mode"") plus two discs of rather comprehensive and interesting bonus content, including hours of making-of documentaries, thousands of behind-the-scenes photos and more.

The packaging is quite nice, though somewhat problematic.  The set includes a nice, glossy cardboard sleeve that serves as a cover to a miniature ""hardcover book"" inside.  The discs are housed in smaller sleeves, which serve as the ""pages"" for the books.  The set itself is quite compact, yet looks good, especially when sitting on a shelf, and the ""book"" has some nice artwork inside.  The only real issue is that because the discs are housed in ""sleeves"", I feel like there's the slight potential to pick up tiny ""scratchies"" if they are frequently removed/put back in.  But it's not too big a concern, so long as you're careful when removing/placing the discs back.

For only about $25, this is definitely a great set to buy, especially as at stores, the individual films are generally anywhere from $8-$15 a piece.  (Generally falling into the $10 range, it seems.)  Definitely a good cost-saver, as it could save you a bit of money depending on where you shop.

I would highly recommend this release.  I'm a fan of the franchise who had never had a chance to own any prior DVD/Blu-Ray releases, and I'm quite happy with this set, especially for the price.

(Edit:  I have had some skipping issues with Disc 2- ""Aliens.""  But it's not consistent, so I cannot tell if it is a fault of the disc or my player.)",1418688000,2,2456,4.951100244498778
1953615,5,B0000VCZK2,"The films themselves are fantastic - I include Aliens 3  in this, even if David Fincher the director doesn't like it - I like everything he touches, so, yeah.

The bigger story here is the presentation on Blu-Ray. You can see these films on TV, you can stream them online, you can buy them on a DVD disc. So why shell out the extra cash to buy these films on Blu-Ray? That's what I'm hear to argue for.

Firstly, Blu-Ray has superior image quality to DVD, even your cable provider and Netflix may say it's a 1080 image but the quality is far compressed compared to Blu-Ray. And with everyone owning a big screen TV, it's impossible to argue for anything less than Blu-Ray quality.

Not only do Blu-Rays have superior visual (and audio) quality - the discs can fit more features. In the case of this package, they use everything they can.

Each film's disc has it's own commentary tracks and various special features. But in addition to what they fit on each films disc there is MORE content about the films on the last two discs. You can choose to watch the movie is MU-TH-UR mode which allows you to bookmark parts of the film that have accompanying special features on the last two discs. You need a USB port on your Blu-Ray player so MU-TH-UR mode can store each of the bookmarks on the USB drive. When you put in either of the last two discs, you can jump right to the feature you were looking for while watching the film. And there are a LOT of features to get through. Hours and hours of them - literally.

Aditionally, the discs may all have the FBI and copyright warning in the beginning but if you put one movie in with a USB drive, it remembers you sat through those warnings once and will automatically skip the warnings on the other discs!

My only complaint about this set is how the discs are stored. You slide them out of a hard cardboard ""page"" in a book of discs. That means the information side of the disc is constantly rubbing against something and that greatly worries me about scratches.",1418601600,3,2009,4.4135135135135135

This is the best movie collection I own.  I've never put a photo in a review before (they're crappy camera shots, sorry), but I was so happy with this one I just had to.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-The movies are great first of all.  Each one comes with the option to watch the original - OR - an updated version/directors cut.  Each disc gives you the standard blu-ray menu you'd expect; such as 'play' 'options' etc etc.

- Presentation is amazing.  I love that we get a book inside of an outer case.  Within the book there's artwork.  This is really high quality, the ""pages"" are extremely thick and the outside of the ""book"" has the feel of a hardcover novel.  There is holographic art on both the outer shell and the book itself.

- Formatting and questions about region lock (seen in other reviews).  I am a US user and watch this on a playstation 4.  I specify this as your bluray player may be different.  All of the discs play and when I look on the bottom of the box I see FBI warnings and markings traditionally seen in the USA.  HOWEVER, there also appear to be european ratings listed as well.  Seems to be formatted for multiple regions, but for more techincal answers on this you should seek advice from other reviewers.  I'm not too savvy with that.  The movies play for me.

++ Attached photos.  Again, sorry for the quality but I wanted you to see it anyway.  One of the photos shows the outside shell and the other shows an example of a ""page"" within and how the disc is stored.  I only show one 'page' here as to not spoil the surprise of the full appearance.

If i lost this or it was damaged I would buy it again in a heartbeat.",1414195200,8,1730,4.442675159235669

1953793,1,B0000VCZK2,"20th century fox again has reissued all 4 ALIEN films as ALIEN QUADRILOGY
which is a reissue of the 2010 ALIEN ANTHOLOGY
only difference is the reissue has none, i mean none of the special features carried over from the 2010 set
the QUADRILOGY is only 4 discs on flip trays of 4 films with the audio commentaries added for each film
and the theatrical trailers of each film that's the only extras any fan will get
a waste of time reissue in my opinion another eg of 20th century fox just trying to make a quick buck
and not caring about the quality of the product
if you don't have it already then buy the 2010 ALIEN ANTHOLOGY set which is 6 Disc set in thick blu-ray case
the U.S. ALIEN ANTHOLOGY is Digi-pak book packaging, the U.K Anthology is standard blu-ray case but both are ABC coded
which does have all 4 films with both versions of each film
plus has all the making of Documentaries & featurettes, stills Photo Galleries, archive featurettes of each film on Disc 5 & 6
worth every Dollar to buy the now 7 year old ALIEN ANTHOLOGY

1953825,3,B0000VCZK2,"I find it odd that I can write a review of an item that we cannot buy yet.  Amazon, how is it fair to a product manufacturer when anyone can write a review here without actually experiencing it, potentially impacting the sales of said item?

That being said, based on the Alien Quadrilogy description, and owning the earlier Alien Anthology Blu-ray set myself, Anthology seems to feature the same movie discs as the Quadrilogy.  This Alien Quadrilogy set simply delivers the best versions of these movies without any bonus material or digital versions.  Assuming the picture and sound quality are the same as the Alien Anthology, then Aliens fans won't be disappointed. The Quadrilogy is ideal for people who don't need hours of extra content, documentaries, etc.  Not having these doesn't make the product bad because it's not claiming to have any of that.  If you want the extra content, then get the Anthology set.

I remember Aliens: The Special Edition on laserdisc being over $100.00 back in the day, and that was for one movie.  So, if you consider the volume of entertainment you get here with a state of the art presentation it's really far from a bad deal for about $30.00.  Also, the box art is great too; I'm almost tempted to buy this on that alone. The only major flaw I see in this set is the lack of digital copies so that these films can be enjoyed on multiple platforms especially when that's a pretty common feature these days.",1413590400,,1446,4.661417322834645
1953826,5,B0000VCZK2,"I was extremely excited to watch the Aliens saga this weekend once I got this in the mail. First disc worked flawlessly with no issues. However, the second disc for whatever reason glitches, skips, and pauses at an hour into both theatrical and special edition versions and will no press past. I thought it was my blu-ray player at first but I've never had any issues with watching movies on it before. I even went as far as to play it on another blu-ray player and it did the exact same thing. Disappointed in my purchase and hope they will fix whatever it is wrong with the 'Aliens' disc for future customers.

Update: Saturday Oct 18th @ 7:22 PM (CST)

Excellent costumer service for this issue, will update review upon receiving my refund and I will re-purchase this item. Hopefully it was a fluke set and my next set is better. Will also update once I receive the new set of blu-rays.

Update: 3 May 2015

So I received my refund from Amazon but during some cleaning and rearranging of my house I ended up moving my blu-Ray set and ""losing it"". Found it earlier this week and decided to try it out one last time before tossing it away. Now, I dunno if it was due to the heat that day or some other weird reason but my movies work flawlessly now. I kind of want to shove a foot in my mouth now because I was definitely upset when they didn't work the first time around. As of right now I'm watching my movies without a hitch. If you end up purchasing this PLEASE, get a good look at the back of your discs if they're free of scratching but look kind of odd, give it some time.

I feel scammed that they would release an inferior product at an increased price years after the Aliens: Anthology Blu-Ray.  In fact, there is no reason to get this collection at all.  This collection is merely a 4-disk set that contains the Theatrical and Special Editions of each movie, nothing more.

1953862,4,B0000VCZK2,"I will admit that I definitely love these movies.  Who would have thought that not only could you fit all of the special features of the Alien Quadrilogy on just two discs of utter mayhem.  Alien Quadrilogy: 5 discs of special features.  Alien Anthology Blu-ray: 2 discs of special features plus some extra goodies that aren't even in the DVD Alien Anthology such as the Family Guy Alien Parody and the Alien Parody from Space Balls.  The first movie will always be the best one.  It almost feels like the theatrical version of the first one is always scary to me.  I think zooming in on that cat when one of the characters gets killed by the Alien is beyond superb.  Mind you, there's only one Alien and several crew members, so it knocks the pants off of anyone who watches it.  However, the director's cut jolts it up several notches and I absolutely love when Ripley sees the Alien cocoon scene.  Absolutely superb.

Then we have the beyond amazing Aliens.  I absolutely love what James Cameron did with the Alien Queen.  This movie is by the far the best in the series.  It takes place nearly 60 years after the first film, even though the sequel is only a 7 year difference between the release date of the original film.  Every character is well loved to me in this film.  Then we get to see Ripley take on the Alien Queen and a hoard of Aliens.  What more could you ask for?  This is also the beefiest of the films clocking in at 2 hours 35 minutes.  I also think the little girl in the film is well casted.  There isn't anything wrong with marvelous movie.  Probably the only thing wrong I can think of is that the theatrical cut should have been  what the extended cut is.  This movie originally got slammed for its long length and was cut by 17 minutes.  James Cameron should have just stuck by his gun caliber and made the extended cut the theatrical cut.  Other than that, brilliant movie.

In all honesty, the 3rd Alien film could have been better.  Don't get me wrong, I love this movie to pieces.  I think it offers up an interesting premise to make our Alien villain a four legged monster this time.  I don't know where the idea came from to make the supposedly last Alien film be in a prison.  I get that Sigourney Weaver wanted to have an Alien kill her at some point.  I think she mentioned at one point that she thought it would be cool if an Alien were inside of her at one point in the story.  Well, she got her wish.  This story does make a great movie with a very dark premise.  The prisoners are crazy mad and that's the way I like them.  I do like that the prisoners fight with their lives to kill the four legged Alien.  The difference between the theatrical cut and the director's cut will astound anyone.  The theatrical has a dog.  The director's cut has a steer.  Both die in mostly the same way.  They said on the special features that they couldn't figure out a way to make the Alien move in the director's cut section, so they wound up going with a dog instead.  It is a very great film.  The only thing that I don't like is that Ripley has to die in the final part of the movie.  You've created such masterpieces with the two original films, why kill off the main character?  It reminds me of the way with T2 Judgment Day.  When I was a kid, I cried when the Terminator character had to die in the 2nd film.  And I felt the same way about Ripley in the Alien 3.  Its an emotional thing I deal with every time I watch the 3rd film.

Have no fear, Ripley returns in the 4th Alien film in the franchise.  I think Sigourney Weaver does an excellent job in the 4th film.  Sure, it isn't the best film, but it does offer up plenty of goodies that make it essential to the Alien films.  I would say that this film offers up a horror/action mash up.  It kind of takes inspiration from Aliens from the 2nd film.  Not in full, just with the aliens factor.  Multiple creatures.  In all honesty, this fourth film offers up some quirky comedy which always makes me laugh.  Never hurts to have comedy in a horror movie.  The Aliens take on a more dinosaur look in this film which is okay.  Just don't go too far away from the original design.  The men offer up plenty of testosterone for everyone to enjoy.  I also love how they decided to go with a female android which is a very nice touch to the robots.  I also love Ripley's comment about what kind of model they created, which always makes me laugh.  Just watch it in the movie, its during the time when the female android connects herself to a bible that manually controls the ship.  She makes for an interesting robot.

Now, I will finish off with the bad stuff, which is how much I had to pay for this.  I was probably one of the many who bought this set of movies on Blu-ray when it first came out.  This means that anyone who didn't wait to purchase it had to pay over $100 for a set of movies that are now at 30 some dollars.  You see, I went to purchase this from FYE, which I admit is an expensive store to begin with.  (For Your Entertainment).  I was originally expecting to have to pay $140 just to get these movies.  I knew right then and there that if the movie did in fact cost that then I would have wiped out my entire allowance from a single purchase.  However, that wasn't the case.  FYE had it on sale for a discount price and after I signed a membership that I canceled after I bought the movie made the movie only $107.  Consider yourselves lucky if you're now just thinking about purchasing these movies.

Regardless, be happy about these films.  This thing offers so much special features in those two special feature Blu-ray Discs that it blows my mind.  It has everything from Alien Quadrilogy and more.  I hope you make the right decision and purchase these movies.",1411603200,2,5767,4.280148423005566

A lot of people didn't like Alien 3, but I thought the story was good, provided a reasonable outcome to the characters in Aliens,  and looked incredible thanks to David Fincher who would go on to direct Se7en, Fight Club, etc... and had GoT's Charles Dance as well as Charles S Dutton and Pete Postlethwaite turning in good performances.",1411603200,,522,4.6521739130434785

It has everything I wanted and - as someone who watches ALL the extra content included with films - more. I especially like the book that the discs are housed in, and the booklet with info on what is on each disc.

The only negative is that when I first put it in my Playstation it gave me an error message saying it couldn't play it, and it loads very slowly with a black screen for a long time, each time making me worry that I'll see that error message again.",1407456000,,637,4.137096774193548

I haven't checked out all the features yet, and Im not sure if I will ever get around to it. At $30 its absolutely a no-brainer.

  I tell you, I really LOVE this series!!!!  It combines two of my favorite Genres, Horror & Sci-fi!  The other being comedy.  The Original ""Alien"" was released in 1979 (which was called ""The Summer Of Fear"" due to the Release of Alien, Nightwing, Phantasm, & Prophesy) & it was an immediate success (along with launching Sigourney Weaver's Carrier).  Aliens was released in the mid-80's.  And it was another immediate succes.  Alien 3 was released in the early 90's & was not as good as the first two.  & Alien Resurection in the late 90's was getting back to the originall two.
  Overall this is wn excellent package set.  It is like getting 8 movies for the price of 4.  Because they have the Original theatricale release and the directors cut for each movie.  Not to mention the hours of extras on these Blu-Rays.

Alien is GREAT!
Aliens is a Masterpiece
Alien 3 is Good
Alien Resurrection, while unneeded was still fun to watch.

1954301,5,B0000VCZK2,"the alien anthology blu ray. yes. i bought this from amazon and it came in 3 days before it said it would, so that was pleasing. This box set has 6 discs. One for each film aswell as two special features discs. The first disc (which was alien) has the theatrical and 2003 special edition versions. The same for all the other films aswell as a couple of comentaries and an isolated score track for each. The special features discs were one for the making of all the films and the other for concept art and other stills frok the making of each movie. The documentaries for making each film range from 1.30 to 2.30.  These documentaries cover the story creature design, and to release aswell as some other things. For example, for aliens it had a featurette on the power loader vs. the queen fight. the stills and art work are exetensive from designing the astronaut suits an space ships to the aliens themselves. It all comes in a hardcover book with the discs in each page and a couple of stills and info about each movie. On the following page, it has a cool picture from the movie. For example, for alien, it showed the space jockey (engineer) and aliens showed the queen fighting ripley. it all goes in an elusive and shiney case wit the xenomorph roaring on it.

While I didn't particually care about the additions [or the base movie for that matter], it was very nice of them to have them included here.

1954515,5,B0000VCZK2,"I recently purchased a PS3 for the bonus of using it as a Blu-ray player, so I set out to purchase the Blu-ray versions of many of my favorite, classic Sci-Fi films.  As the title of my review suggests, I already own the Alien Anthology DVD Edition, so I wanted to compare between the two for quality, which is why I gave it 5 stars.  At the time I have posted this review, the Blu-Ray version is also incredibly cheap already for such a new release (2013) while the DVD version was released in (2010) - far cheaper than when I originally purchased the DVD Edition a few years ago.  However, both are about the same price point now depending on sales.  The extra money IS worth it for the Blu-Ray version if you have the means to play them.

My review also contains below my thoughts on each film as well if you prefer an opinion if these films are even worth watching (if you are a first time viewer).  And also, if one is deciding whether or not to watch the ""theatrical"" release or ""director's cut"" first of each film.

IMAGE QUALITY:

- Outstanding

While the DVD version is already pretty decent, the Blu-Ray version of each of these films are definitely high-quality.  A lot sharper detail on everything.  There are definitely areas of scenes that were far more clearer, especially for background area, compared to the older VHS, and then transition to DVD.

SOUND QUALITY:

- Excellent

Again here, my opinion is that the sound has improved slightly from the DVD version.  This Blu-Ray version specifically has cleaned up audio on some of the films such as the Alien 3 Director's Cut DVD.  The original Alien 3 Director's Cut DVD had input alternate or new scenes, but the audio that was spliced in was extremely quiet - it was so queit they put text on the TV so you could actually hear what they are saying for specific extra scenes.  On the Blu-Ray version its not a problem at all, you can hear them perfectly and they removed the automatic subtitling from those scenes.

OVERALL PACKAGE:

- VERY good

Plenty of extra's, all of the director's cut and theatrical releases are available in high quality, you can also watch them with commentary on or off, and there is also another disc that delves into the Alien Universe.

THE FILMS:

My first recommendation is to watch all of these in order, to really get a sense of the beginning of the film that definitely defined true Horror combined with Science Fiction.  No doubt, these films gave me nightmares when I was child.

Alien (Must See) - Where it all started and while it is old, it has stood up to the test of time with a sense of 'believability' despite the old technology used to make the film.  You'll feel like you are watching real people on a space ship that are exploring planets.
------
*Should I watch the Theatrical or Director's Cut first?  I recommend watching the Director's Cut -- The extra scenes do 'add' to the film's original plot, rather than becoming distractions.  But do definitely watch the Theatrical release to see the difference and decide for yourself.

Aliens (Excellent) - The nightmare is back for Ripley and this time its payback.  The character is a strong-willed survivor that really shows that Female Heroines are needed in more films and stories.  You might be thinking, well Ripley has backup this time, so maybe nothing too bad will happen, right, RIGHT?  But most people already do know if they haven't seen it already ;).  I think the premise of these films is more believable in confronting an unknown horror, while not invincible, the Aliens (or ""xenomorphs"") of this fictional universe are deadly efficient and do not give up.
------
*Should I watch the Theatrical or Director's Cut first?  DEFINITELY watch the Director's Cut first - again, the extra scenes do add to the overall arcing story rather than significantly altering anything.  Watch the Theatrical Release to see the difference.

Alien 3 (Very Good) - Controversial for many fans, as many film goers or avid book readers are used to the Hero or Heroine and their friends having a perfect ending, which is a common ""trope"" of stories.  This film takes that idea and turns it upside down, because this is the Alien Universe after all.  Not everything turns out perfect in our world or a fictional world, and certainly not a fictional universe with aliens such as Xenomorphs.  As I said with ""Aliens"" - Xenomorphs are relentless, emotional, nightmarish creatures that will do anything to propagate its species like an overgrown parasite.  For those that have seen it, they will know exactly what I am referring to, but I do not want to spoil it for those that have not seen it.  For what's it worth, I think the setting is perfect and conducive to the dark, creepy settings of the first two films and the ending is also good, with a sense of relief for the main character (The Nightmare feels like it is finally over).
------
*Should I watch the Theatrical or Director's Cut first?  For this one, I have to say that the Theatrical release SHOULD be watched first.  The Director's Cut is essentially an ALTERNATE movie with different events taking place, while its 'ok' in its own right, the Theatrical release feels more appropriate to the continuity of watching each film in succession.  DO watch the Director's cut after to see the difference.

Alien 4 or ""Alien Resurrection"" (Fair/Good) - I have always had mixed feelings about this film, as is common for many other fans of the series.  The setting is great, but the writer (Joss Whedon) often input satirical components into the Alien Universe, which felt out of place.  There is a joke, for instance, in the film (SPOILER?) where the always ""up to no good"" corporation ""Weyland Yutani"" (which any reader should or viewer of all of the 3 previous films should know by now) is ""bought up by Wal-Mart.""  Its one of those moments where you kind of just have to laugh at the absurdity of placing such a comment in a film like this.
The film itself still captures the horrifying feeling from the first 3 films and the specific effects are definitely great for both the new ""CGI"" Xenomorphs and the newest suits they used for the Xenomorphs.  However, the story itself takes out any of the mystery and ""unknown"" from the first films.  All in all - the film itself feels like a mess, and Ripley is deduced to a campy action hero, BUT the ACTING is plenty good for what it is.
------
*Should I watch the Theatrical or Director's Cut first?  I would have to say the Director's Cut in this instance, the original theatrical release (according to the director Jeunet who was already at odds with the writer Joss Whedon), was in essence the ""actual"" director's cut.  The extra scenes in the Director's scene do lend to try and connect Ripley to the former films.

So there you have it folks.  Its fairly cheap at the time I bought it and definitely a great addition for any movie collector, avid film watcher, or Sci-Fi Junkie.",1387929600,,6939,4.6358428805237315

They take a particularly long time to load on our NEW pan 3D players and generally require you to have a storage SD card on your B-R player to function. So be patient when first inserting/loading.

Sigourney Weaver maintains an amazing character in these movies.  The best part is how she becomes emotilaly void and harder as the sequels continue.

1954695,1,B0000VCZK2,"I was very excited about this set at the price until the second film, Aliens, would not play. Amazon issued me a new set and again it would not play. After some research I realized that this is an all region import, from where I do not know, but all region discs are notorious for having playback problems in many North America players. I am sending mine back for a refund and you should be very careful to be sure any discs you buy say region 1 or A in North America. Too bad too because there are a lot of extras, although the transfers on the other films are not so good but then again it's not an official north american release and not subject to the same standards.",1385683200,,671,4.1692307692307695
1954696,5,B0000VCZK2,All of Alien's movies in Blu Ray!!!  I really like this compilation.  These movies have been cleaned up and even have the director's cuts on some.  I really only cared for the first and second movie but having all of these is worth it.  Highly recommended.,1385424000,,256,4.5
1954697,5,B0000VCZK2,"I'm so glad I decided to purchase these films in box set instead of just the individual ones I like. The extra footage around the making of the film, especially the original, was very exciting (and there is A LOT of extra behind-the-scenes info to know about). I also really like the packaging, it's well made and slim enough to fit nicely on any media shelf. As for the movies, 1 & 2 are my favorites (I'm pretty sure I can recite Aliens by heart) but it was more cost effective to have the whole set. And this way I get to give the last two a few more views. There wasn't a behind-the-scenes on the 4th one, which I thought was interesting, but this is a product that delivers and at an amazing sale price for blu-ray!",1385424000,,720,4.22463768115942

1954699,5,B0000VCZK2,"I had wanted this blu-ray collection ever since it was first revealed and released. I had to wait awhile, because like many, I can't afford everything I want. Black Friday and holiday sales is the best way to go sometimes. The movies look gorgeous and there's just an extensive array of special features, the value is just there.

I know Alien Resurrection is looked upon very poorly, but I enjoyed it much more than Alien 3 (the sole terrible Fincher movie, but it wasn't his fault). Ron Perlman was great in it, and it's just a fun time. Sure, its arguable some of that may have been unintentional, but the same director made Amelie, The City of Lost Children and Delicatessen. I've watched Aliens more than all the others combined probably. James Cameron was just at the top of his game as he made his way to king of the world. Once you're at the top, you have nowhere to go but down. I don't look upon the first Alien as highly as others, but horror isn't my most favorite of genres.

Even if you like only one of these movies, especially if you love the first or the second or both, this set is the PREMIERE version to own.",1385251200,,1128,4.366666666666666

1954701,5,B0000VCZK2,"You cannot go wrong with this set. Absolutely gorgeous packaging and a crapload of bonus content. The menus are loaded with details of each specific movie and you can just spend your time looking at them. The quality of the movies itself is a HUGE leap from previously released DVD version, especially with Aliens. Would I have paid the original $70 that it cost? Probably not. Should you get it for $25? Hell to the YES.",1385078400,,421,4.552631578947368

The packaging is GREAT, a nice ""book"" with very cool art and the DVD's are well spaced out.  The movies are just the best if you are a Sci Fi fan of movies like these.  I'm really glad I went ahead with these.",1384819200,,383,3.75
1954703,4,B0000VCZK2,"The packaging is impressive, small footprint but high quality graphics.  Patience is needed to play the movies.  The message that my blue ray player might need to download new software came up each time I started to play a new disc.

1954724,5,B0000VCZK2,This Box Set of the Alien Anthology had a big issue at the time of its release being made for newer blue ray players. The player updates weren't even available either so many people found (as I did) unplayable. It was months later that I was able to get an update that allowed the discs to play. Now of course all blue ray players will play this set just fine. It features an option to binge watch the four movies skipping menus and home screens.

If you haven't seen them before here is your opportunity to do so. This Alien Boxset if in my top five sci-fi boxsets that I own. You can't lose if this set is what you choose.

1954729,4,B0000VCZK2,I love the alien series. This set includes two cuts of all four films. The special features are great.  Both Alien and Aliens have introductions by the directors on the director's cut.,1384473600,,184,4.75
1954730,5,B0000VCZK2,"The most complete and comprehensive set on Alien movies imaginable.
The Alien ""Anthology"" (a much classier word than ""Quadrilogy"". Yuck.) is brought to blu ray with class and gusto.
The transfer on the first two films are demo disc quality. Alien looks as good as Blade Runner does, and that movie is in my top ten blu rays of all time. Aliens is nearly as powerful with little holding it back from being a damn good transfer in it's own right.
Fans of 1 & 2 won't be disappointed with this completionist set. Even if you don't care for 3 and 4, the extras native to this pack are worth it. Especially since I've seen prices for this pack drop under $40.
This set made me capitulate and give Alien 3 a rewatch on it's alternate cut. The Assembly Cut I believe.
Which is actually a blu ray exclusive in and of itself. On the DVD sets, it was a workprint cut. Not as refined, still kinda choppy.
It's been cleaned up and given the red carpet treatment here which is amazing, because it makes the movie better. Not only better, it justifies the movie's existence. Alien 3 is now a personal favorite.
The impact of this blu ray set actually changed my mind about a movie- for the better. The enlightening making of documentaries surrounding each film are also amazing, but none more so than Alien 3. The troubled production, chronicled (more or less) unbiasedly in ""Wreckage and Rage"" might be the unsung gem of this set. It offers a look inside the messed up production of the sequel to one of the most loved sci-fi movies ever. Stress and pressure for ages behind the scenes of this movie, it's bound to give you a new perspective on Alien 3 and why it could've been every bit as good as Alien and Aliens.
Fear not, the all-encompassing behind the scenes and making of's are just as in-depth for each movie without exception.
Even for the much maligned Alien Resurrection, you might be shocked at how interesting the special features are.
No movie was shortchanged in this set, and for fans it's a must own.
It has become a quintessential blu ray set in my collection, and one that I'm beyond proud to own.",1384473600,,2104,4.481770833333333

1954733,4,B0000VCZK2,"Great series!  Great visuals and sounds!  Movie magic!

Ironically, the first movie transferred to Blu-ray the best.  It's like seeing it for the first time.  My VHS copy can finally be retired.  The others weren't quite as crisp, but looked way better than a standard DVD transfer.  The extra discs included really cement this package as a great deal.  If you are really ""into"" movies and how they come to life, this is a perfect set for an Alien fan.  I've seen these movies dozens of times each and they never get old.  It's fun to get a peek behind the curtain and see how these movies were made.  There were two versions of each of the four movies, theatrical release and a director's cut.

Containing everything for the casual fan to the religious fanatic, this collection transcends expectations of what is possible in home entertainment.

It was love at first sight. Then seeing Aliens on the big screen brought it to a new level. I purchased the first Alien box set on DVD way back in the late 90's...

1954800,5,B0000VCZK2,"I have to say the Blu-ray transfer of these films is excellent. I really like the movies (well, the first two, for sure) and seeing them in stunning Blu-ray with enhanced sound quality is almost like seeing new movies...even better than the theater versions I first saw.

The packaging is pretty cool in a ""picture book"" style case. The discs are securely held in place, each in their own cardboard sleeve. Although this serves well to hold the discs, it is a bit difficult to get them out of the recessed circular holders. I read another reviewer say, (paraphrasing) with practice they are not too hard to remove. Uh, something I really don't want to practice.

I do like that these discs go straight the movies without any previews or advertising although they may take a moment to load because they want to use your internet connection. So, if your player has not already established an internet connection, these discs may force/wait for connection then load movie controls. You may speed loading time by turning off your BD-Live feature on you Blu-ray/DVD player.

Overall, I am very happy to have these movies on Blu-ray included with many extras as well as Director's Cut of Alien and Extended version of Aliens. Plus, it appears the first movie (Alien) is double-layered with the SD version. I know I waited to buy these movies but, for 20 dollars, I'll give it 5 stars even with the mediocre movies, Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection.",1383436800,,1440,4.752
1954801,5,B0000VCZK2,".
We all know the movies already, my review pertains to this particular amazing box set release. It is really, really well done.

The packaging is very cool. They managed to make it small and compact yet elegant and smart looking. To accomplish this, each one of the six discs is not in its own enclosed case. Instead, each individual disc is tucked into a sleeve that sits on top of a very thick (very, like 3-5 millimeters) cardboard page. Some may object to each disc not having its own box, but I think it's done well plus I am always very careful handling discs. This ""book"" then slides into an outer protective box.

As far as the disc content goes, the best way to describe this is- comprehensive and definitive. For each film you can choose between the original theatrical release or the directors cut (if there was one). I know that the first film, Alien, received a new 4K transfer. Not sure if this goes for the others. All four films are pristine transfers and look stunning. Lossless DTS-HD Master 5.1 audio is available on all films.

I scoured the bonus material and as far as I can tell (and also what I've read), there is simply no supplemental material that has ever been available to the home theater market that is not in this box set. It has everything and I mean going way back to the laser disc releases. Speaking of which, I thought it was kind of neat to look at some of those old laser disc supplements and take a look at the technology and to see the look of the format.

Many moons ago I paid $90 for this (that's right, NINETY bucks! - and it's worth it). It's now selling for far below that. So if you are a fan of any (or all) of these films, this is a wonderful anthology box set to own.",1383350400,,1719,4.296296296296297

The quality of all the movies in this set is debatable; I love them all, some just more so than others.

Now outside of the movies themselves, this set has some of the BEST remastering I have ever seen on any format. With the first three movies the video quality is gorgeous and crystal clear; I've even been told that this set has been used to test out the black levels for newer TV's and I believe it!
The fourth movie doesn't fair as well in the visual department, but that has more to do with how the movie was filmed than the quality of this set (supposedly vasolene or something similar was smeared onto the camera lens before filming to give it a distinct 'slimy' look). In spite of that this is the best transfer this movie has had so far.

Audio quality is equally impressive for all the movies. I just love cranking up the surround sound while watching these. ^_^

Special features are where the set really shines as it has hours upon hours of great and really interesting bonus features, behind the scenes documentaries and cast interviews. There's even a cool little interactive element to they way you can watch these that mimic's Mother from the first Alien movie.

The atmosphere created by Ridley Scott, in the spaceship and on the remote planet, is very believable. And the seven member-cast is great, as you get to know them well, which makes their deaths, mysteries and conquests all the more interesting. And scary! The Director's Cut is a nice improvement, adding scenes that give more banter between the crew members, more time on the creepy alien spaceship, and what actually happened to Dallas and Brett.

All you wanted to know on these films has been covered and yes, really, you DO get about 50 hours of entertainment watching these. From reading the scripts, to acting out takes, the behind the scenes stories, this set is worth it for ANY Alien fan!

People have said they would have liked a bit more juicy stuff concerning Alien3, and I do agree that Fox screwed us over a little bit on that regard. However, it's definitely not enought to take away any points when you see the rest of this fan's dream come true. I enjoyed all the movies to an extint, part 4 being by far the least enjoyed. The first was horrifying, the second perfectly action-packed, the third dark and depressing (but fantastic), and the fourth a major let down that changed the formula. Still, I didn't ""hate"" it.

All in all I have never seen this much effort put into a set. Especially to make 2 different versions of each, and the little bonus book was great fun as well =)

Some have complained on the packaging...well, I can see where it *IS* annoying getting dvds out of the plastic containers from time to time. I see this in most DVDs I buy now though. It wasn't anything different in the way they make individual or box cases. And I actually liked how they did the fold out. Unrolling something that keeps going and going and making your friends and familys mouths DROP is always worth a good time =)

1954918,5,B0000VCZK2,"Full disclosure: I'm a big fan of this genre. From the first movie to the last (at least in this package), I've liked them all. The concept, the futility, the overall design of the alien - all of it appeals to me.

That being said, this anthology, which does not include the latest movie - the prequel - is an excellent example of what combo sets could and should look like. Many raters tend to downgrade a movie release because the movie house fails to release x, y, or z along with the movie. I'm not saying they are wrong - as I imagine they are likely collectors who want to see the floor room footage or the extended scenes or whatever it is they feel the publisher failed to add. I, however, buy movies for the sheer enjoyment they bring me. If I find myself flipping channels and stopping on a movie that was made a decade or two ago on a channel that will interrupt me every 15-30 minutes with commercials and still sitting through it, then most likely that movie will make the cut to purchase as soon as a good deal comes along.

The Alien Anthology is just that deal. This brings you the best of the Alien series (yes, there could have been more of this or that added, but as stated, I simply wanted the movies) and all in a great package design. The movies come in a sleeve that is designed to look like a book. At first, when I opened my box I thought I had received the wrong item - as I didn't see the normal plastic cases with DVDs/Blu-Rays in them. Then I started flipping through the artwork and realized the discs were firmly nestled and integrated directly into the artwork. What a novel concept! H.R. Giger, the designer/artist behind the Alien look, would be proud (imho).

As for the movies - they are still as good today as they were when I originally viewed them in theaters, on VHS, on DVD, on prime time television and now on Blu-Ray. No, I don't believe that they made ""vast"" improvements to the footage by converting it to Blu-Ray, but it is still a joy to watch. You get a few nice extras on the blu-ray discs, but I'll leave that type of review to those that find the extras to be what makes/breaks a collection, as I never tend to click on those extras anyway.

My only concern and only time will tell if it is warranted, is that the discs are firmly seated in this book format. I can see the potential for the discs to scratch as you pull them in/out of the book. I may be a bit overly sensitive on this mater, as discs have been getting better and better over the years, but I figured it was worth mentioning - if you are the type to watch these movies weekly, you may want to protect your asset a little better and put them in something a bit easier to access.

Overall, I'd say this is a great collection and if you happen to score a great deal (like I did on a Gold Box day), you'll be happy to have picked up this wonderful alien themed movie anthology.",1379203200,,2890,4.228260869565218

The fidelity of both audio and video blows me away, even after being a fan of the films for nearly thirty years. I'll let you go to bluray.com for a better review than I can give.
But if you're looking for the best quality the Alien franchise has had to offer, you've found it here. The British import didn't give my american blu ray player any problem.",1379116800,,562,4.413461538461538

These blu-ray editions really bring the movies back to life.  The bonus features are awesome.  The Alien 3 ""making of"" featurette was supurb. To be fair, all of the making-of featurettes are great.  However, Alien Resurrection still sucks...but the other 3 more than make up for the one dud.",1379030400,,418,4.9

I found the latest movies bluish in few scenes.  As long as you know the plot of The first Alien, second time, watching is rather boring experience. Many complain about ""Alien resurrection"", but I found this one more interesting than ""Aliens""",1378339200,,408,4.513513513513513

The casing is icing on the cake, as each disc is properly and safely stored in a beautiful (in a disturbing horror-science-fiction way) hardback page surrounded by images from the series.

Alien: Anthology contains more bonus material than you could shake a flamethrower at: MU-TH-UR Mode, an interactive Weyland-Yutani Database; 12-hours of quality in-depth interviews with cast and crew; Alien: Evolution, and other fantastic featurettes; plus the bonus material from the Alien Legacy set and even the Special Edition Laser Disc sets bonus material (you can finally put away your Laser Disc player). Coupled with the theatrical releases, Directors cuts, and other special additions for each of the four films, Alien: Anthology judges other Blue-ray box sets and finds them wanting.

The franchise where the best and brightest cut their teeth: Sir Ridley Scott (Blade Runner & Gladiator), James Cameron (The Abyss & Terminator 2), David Fincher (Se7en & Fight Club), Jean-Pierre Jeunet (The City of Lost Children & Am&eacute;lie), and Joss Whedon (Everything that is good at Comic Con) top the list of creative talent that left their indelible mark on the Alien mythology.

1954987,4,B0000VCZK2,When I received this Blu-ray set I was thrilled to see the nicely done wrapping surrounding the Alien Anthology. What do I mean? Well the outside cover was not at all obtruvise to view. The inner wrapper was literally like a book. The movies speak for themselves. The sound of course is a key factor with any Blu-ray and of course it meant my familly and friends expectations. I prefer the DVD version when it comes to what was inside the box but this is one Anthology worth owning.,1377129600,,482,4.426966292134831

The case is beautiful and was in prime condition, and it doesn't even bother me that when fully open, it has to be at least five feet long. All the discs were scratch free and in place, something that's rare with big collections as a disc or two tends to fall out of it's spot during travel.",1377043200,,474,4.163043478260869

1955024,5,B0000VCZK2,Great collection... I remember seeing the first Alien in a theater when it came out. This is great because it has the Directors cuts. It was many years before I actually saw them. They make the movies much more sensible.,1376524800,,220,4.525

Not to mention the two exta content discs!,1376265600,,270,4.113207547169812
1955031,4,B0000VCZK2,"When you watch this anthology you realize how things have changed in terms of cinema over the past decades. These movies are pieces of art. Some of the not-so-into-alien audience might get bored because of the ""slowness"" of the movies, or the lack of explosions and special effects, but the ""thriller"" concept in this movies is amazing. The movies would get a 4.5 stars from me. The packaging, even though it looks pretty cool, is a little taller because of the hard case than the rest of blu-rays, which makes it harder to store in a regular drawer-case. The extra features are not that good though, but to be able to have the original and special editions of all the films makes it a pretty good deal.",1376265600,,703,4.543307086614173

1955040,4,B0000VCZK2,"The Alien Series is a classic movie series that everyone should have in their collection. What's great with the Anthology pack is you actually get 8 films (each movie comes with the original theatrical verson + some sort of extended/special edition one) + two extra disks for the Mu-th-er Mode extra features. The Blu-rays do a great job of cleaning up the picture that even the original print from '79 looks sharp and clean. My only complaint is that the disks are very difficult to remove. They sit inside carboard pages of a book setup instead of having the normal secure plastic locks like on other DVD/Blu-rays. Half the disk is covered by the carboard page, which makes it very difficult to put your finger in the center hole, and makes it impossible to pull the disc straight out like normal. Instead you have to wedge it out with two hands, which causes the bottom of the disc to scrape against the side of its sleeve. So far this hasn't caused the discs to become scratched yet, but I'd feel much better if the discs would lift straight out like normal. Whoever designed the unique design to this way of packing DVD/Blu-rays should go back to the drawing board.",1376179200,,1170,4.6028708133971294

Ridley Scott and James Cameron were great and made a good effort to let us into their world.  Honestly, the French chap from Resurrection could have made a bit more effort and been a bit less arrogant...  The last movie was always a bit weak I always thought anyway.

I remember I wasn't even old enough to see the movie yet, but I bought the old-school behind-the-scenes picture book and poured over it day and night. We all piled into the living room to watch Ridley Scott's original on VHS and I dropped a stuffed animal on my little sisters head during the scene when the facehugger drops on Ripley... Scared the crap out of her!

Watching the series again on Blu Ray was like watching them again for the first time. The picture is as sharp as it could possibly be, the presentation is flawless. They even cleaned up the Extended Cut of Alien 3, WITH THE RIGHT ENDING! None of that popping out at the last minute crap.

1955165,4,B0000VCZK2,The first 2 movies in this blu-ray set has to be the gold standard on how to transfer movies to blu-ray. This was a steal for $20 although the 3rd and 4th movie are absolute crap. The blu-ray transfer on the first 2 movies (Alien and Aliens) is stupendous. You know that the transfer has been done meticulously when you see the dark portions of the movie. Especially in aliens when they are moving in the dark with their mounted flash lights. Deducted a point because Alien 3 got stuck in a few places .I had to reset the blu-ray player and skip the portions where it got stuck and would not play. ALIEN Resurrection played well though. Buy it just for the first 2 .The classics have become classier :-),1375920000,,703,4.374045801526718

The book is adorable, which houses all of the Blu-rays.  My only complaint with the book, is the placement of the movies.  Unfortunately, I had to return my first copy, because of scratches.  After inspecting my replacement, I decided to leave the extras within the book.  I removed the movies and placed them in separate cases.  Didn't want to do this because of space issues, but had to limit the chance of scratches.

It's going to take a little while to watch everything, with all the extras.  So far I am enjoying looking at the movies with vibrant colors, alternate endings, and scarier viewing.  Glad I bought it when it was $19.99.",1375747200,,808,4.510344827586207

I thoroughly enjoyed the whole set. Each one has its high points and I enjoyed every new addition. Obviously when the same character/monster is repeated in every new sequel, it is gonna get a bit, well, ""repetitive"". Each sequel though does have its variations and new situations and being a fan I loved them all. I think this series is a classic in its genre.

1955224,5,B0000VCZK2,"My hubby is the hardcore Alien fan in our family and I purchased this for him.
I'd gotten him the full DVD set of all the Alien movies a few years ago when it first came out. I'm talking about the big box with like 9 or 10 discs.
That thing is a behemoth and when he opens it fully it to show all the discs it must be close to 5 feet wide, if not more. And each version of each movie is on a separate disc. And then there are the extras discs. When it's spread out all the way it takes the entire couch. It's pretty much a pain if you want to watch Alien 3 or 4 to unfold all that.
This Blu-ray set is so much smaller - 5 discs in a box half the size of the first ( valuable for limited shelf space ) and contains even more features. And the box format itself is way better...not sure how to say this other than they got a lot more content into a lot less physical space.
One disc has both the theatrical and ""special edition""/""directors cut"" versions of each Alien movie so that saves a lot of space.
And the extra features have everything on the old set and more. Some are even on the same disc as the movie they pertain to. Hubby loves that he has even more content on fewer discs.
The movies also look amazing in Blu-ray...just when you thought it was safe to be satisfied they blow you away again!
I also got an amazing price with my Amazon ""Prime"" discount and it arrived a day sooner than promised.
Hubby is over the moon and I'd gladly get this for him again.
Even though I have to sit through the movies AGAIN...at least they look and sound awesome!

1955257,5,B0000VCZK2,"Picked this up for cheap as a Goldbox deal and I am very pleased.

The new 4K transfers and digital restorations of Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986) are excellent - detail, color, contrast, all were superb and on par with quality transfers from much more recent films. It takes a lot of skill and knowledge to do something like this correctly and they succeeded. Prior to this latest transfer and digital restoration for Blu-ray, Aliens looked terrible on DVD when compared with Alien. Yet, now it almost looks as good as Alien. Audio tracks sound great, too.

If you're interested in a 4K transfer and digital restoration gone wrong, see Predator: Ultimate Hunter Edition. They got carried away with DNR and the Blu-ray presentation ended up terrible.

Update: Have now watched Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection and neither looks as good as Alien or Aliens. These must have used the original transfers and were not redone for the Anthology. They aren't bad, they just don't look as good. To put it in perspective: I would rate Alien and Aliens as 5/5, whereas Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection are 4/5.",1373500800,,1095,4.783068783068783

1955315,4,B0000VCZK2,"The product is  very nicely constructed and has many photographs printed inside the book like case pages with quotes that would make any alien fan smile. The blu-rays contain two versions of the films one is the theatrical and the other is either a directors cut or special edition version with some cool extras. The separate extras are on two separate discs contain literally hours of backstage filming footage, documentaries and a bunch of other cool stuff that I can't completely recall at this time. After all is said it's a nice product that deserves to be purchased to experience an all in one alien collection. However this amazing package doesn't come without a serious flaw. The discs are in the pages of the book casing and in such a way that it makes it a pain to remove or place back the discs lucky it's blu-ray and is more resilient to scratching. But even so it shouldn't exist in the first place because it still is a inconvience to get a disc out of the case. You also may end up tearing the small paper like section holding the discs which is not cool and is a pain in the ass. But if you can overlook this major problem then you will most definitely love this collection if your a alien fan with all its content it's really hard not to. My final say is ""Thank god [whatever you believe in] it's blu-ray format because the discs would have been scratched to s*** if it was DVD or something like that.""",1369180800,3,1419,4.416030534351145

Now for the movies, Alien (directed by Ridley Scott) is a classic, it's scary and cool, and suspenseful. I love that movie. Aliens (directed by James Cameron) is even better!! Alien3 (directed by David Fincher) is the least loved of the franchise, but I still love it, it has a really important part of the story! THEN OMG Alien Resurrection (directed by JeanPierre Jeunet) is the coolest film of them all. It has the best plot, the best characters, the MOST aliens, the best cinematography, the best everything.

Nine (9) DVD's come in this box and each film has two versions for you to choose from, which consist of the original theatrical version, and the directer's cut version. In my opinion, Alien and Aliens both were better in the director's cut with some added scenes that answered some questions. Alien 3 was best in the theatrical version. The director's cut of it was way overdone in length which took away the horro element of it. Aliens 4 was all right in the director's cut.

Incorporating constructed dioramas, digital manipulation, appropriated family photographs and traditional photography, the work forgoes a diaristic approach to the subject matter, and instead builds an alternate reality over my own biography, abstracting the specifics of a personal narrative into an elusive, alien world.

There is no distinction between landscape, portrait, or still life in the work.  The photographs phase in and out of genre, referencing notions of spectacle, queerness, and horror, while continually deconstructing and reconfiguring the roles of the subjects and the world they inhabit.  Linear time is collapsed throughout the photographs, blurring the boundaries between past, present, and future.

Though an immensely personal body of work, specific details are rendered insignificant by new forms that emerge.  What remains are photographs of a town ruined by a storm, and a family getting old.",1367971200,,1080,5.761006289308176

1955364,5,B0000VCZK2,"The presentation of these movies is beautiful! This is an easily displayable case that you'll brag about to your friends.

The main thing I remember about this awesome series outside the movies themselves is a bit of history you may not be familiar with. You see, serious Sci-fi back when these movies were made almost NEVER had a Female lead that survived. This was the BEST of an extremely limited group. So, when Alien-3 killed off the Ripley character there was a some Big Time noise from the female side of the Sci-fi fan world. Resurrection, with the return of HER was almost demanded by the female fans. Of course the series was so popular, another movie made financial sense. But I would like to think that Alien-4 bringing back Ripley had, at least, a little to do with the need to bring a strong female lead back to the Sci-fi world.

IMHO Alien-3 (despite the death of Ripley), was the worst of the bunch. It felt static, stuck on limited sets. Each character standing around waiting for their queue to speak again. It not only killed Ripley but attempted to kill the entire series with it. This followed two of the most awesome Sci-fi/Horror movies I've ever seen. It felt like the Writers/Director/Producers were done with the whole idea. AND they killed off Ripley to say ""WE don't want to do any more of these movies"".

Alien-4 was for the fans. Better than 3 but not really that good. It brought Ripley back and attempted to blend the 1st movie with the 2nd. It failed. The monster really sucked. The blending of human DNA with Alien DNA ended up looking stupid, not scary at all.

Alien and Aliens are kick-A awesome! Each are stand alone movies that complete their stories. Enough is told that a sequel is possible but not required.

You would think that the way I feel about 3 & 4 would pull my rating down some. I thought about that but I must give this release 5-stars. Four movies were made and the complete collection must be owned. This Boxed 6-disc release is just too full of extras. Looks too nice as a display.

1955402,5,B0000VCZK2,The extras and movies are good. The detail of coverage is very good. I didn't like that the movies are kept in cardboard sleeves inside the case. These have always lead to scratches on discs for me. Mostly I got the product for the sake of its price. Four movies (three of them I like to watch) for twenty bucks and on blue-ray is a good deal.,1365552000,,343,4.134328358208955

1955407,5,B0000VCZK2,"to all fans of this franchise: buy it confidently!

just make sure you either have a region free player or region A player if you buy non international version.
don't know why, but on Amzon is advertised as being all regions, while in fact it is only for region A.
maybe they will fix this, so that people do not get mislead.",1365120000,,325,4.241935483870968

1955421,5,B0000VCZK2,"Beautiful transfers. Beautiful collection. I believe that there is another collection available with more memorabilia but this is just fine for those who love the films more than just collecting. The the box itself is lovely.

While I'm not a fan of the last film, it was actually cheaper to get the anthology than to buy the three films that I do enjoy. So, I'm happy.",1364947200,,369,4.590909090909091
1955422,5,B0000VCZK2,This is a perfect set. Nothing I would have changed and probably the best packaging and artwork I have ever seen on a set.,1364860800,,122,4.125

1955426,5,B0000VCZK2,"The out side case for this item is wonderful, and they really did a great job on this Blu Ray. Worth the money IMO to get this one on Blu Ray. The up converting made a huge difference and the sound really jumps off the page now.",1364515200,,228,3.872340425531915
1955427,5,B0000VCZK2,Have the original movies but had to get the set in Blue-ray. Great extras good price a must for those of us wanting to add to their blue-ray collection,1364515200,,151,4.241379310344827
1955428,5,B0000VCZK2,"Where do I begin, the sound effects and the 1080P HD video is out of this world, I also like the deleted scenes I was able to understand somethings that are hard to follow, like the backstory, unless you watch some of the extra material that comes in the discs. Love the commentary by the Director and the Actors. The only other collection I can compare to this one to as far as quality is probably Star Wars. If you are a Science Fiction fan you won't regret this purchase.",1364428800,,474,4.277777777777778
1955429,5,B0000VCZK2,"No problem at all.

Would recommend to anyone that asked.  Product was on time as represented and and good value",1364256000,,112,4.55

1955452,5,B0000VCZK2,Its a nice set.  Lots of extras.  Here are some more words to fill the review quota.  three more words...,1363910400,,105,4.15
1955453,5,B0000VCZK2,if YOU LIKED THE ALIEN MOVIES YOU GOTTA HAVE IT!!! IT'S WORTH THE PRICE.  MUCH CHEAPER THAN BUYING SEPERATE. GIVE IT A TRY!!!,1363910400,,125,4.434782608695652
1955454,5,B0000VCZK2,"Great box in every way possible and very pleasent surprise for me was that the movies have finnish subtitles, which is not very common in region A releases! Only region A is mentioned on the covers, but the discs are playable also on the region B players.",1363824000,,255,4.446808510638298
1955455,5,B0000VCZK2,This is amazing. The Blu-ray technology really makes these old films stand out. I have never been happier with a film selection.,1363737600,,128,4.863636363636363
1955456,5,B0000VCZK2,"Having owned the quadrilogy on VHS for many years, finally upgrading it to Blu-ray is a huge step up. But the extra pixels in the video aren't the only things making this boxset worth owning.

Filled with a metric ton of special features (which would easily take you a good couple of days to finish in entirety), including several documentaries, alternate cuts (including the fabled Fincher's Director's Cut of Alien 3), commentaries and trivia bits, the Alien Anthology boxset will quench the thirst of any Alien fan.",1363737600,,518,4.954022988505747
1955457,5,B0000VCZK2,Bought as gift for grandson who loves it.  All the extra material are a plus. Nice keepsake for a classic set of movies.,1363651200,,120,4.217391304347826
1955458,5,B0000VCZK2,"This is a cult classic: if you aren't sure about the movies by now, you never will. So I'll talk about the quality of the Blu-ray edition compared to DVD.

First of all, these are the full extended editions, at least the first two. I don't care much for the second two so I haven't watched them yet. Might not ever.

Anyway, the first two look and sound really good. They don't look as good as new releases on Blu-ray of course, but they did more than just go back to the original (which even back then the film quality was better than DVD). They obviously cleaned it up a bit and did some processing on it to make the movies look even more sharp and detailed. Some scenes are better than others. For example, the dropship scene in Aliens is a little bit better. But the entry into the aliens' nest was breathtaking.

For suspense/action movies, these are still difficult to beat and have stood the test of time. Between the near-perfect pacing, creepy sound track, effective use of light and dark, etc. these are cinematic masterpieces. I watch them on a regular basis, maybe every 2-3 months. I never grow tired of it even after all these years, and I am very grateful to have them on Blu-ray so I can experience the movie on my big screen almost as if I were in the theater many years ago.

P.S. No matter how many times I watch Aliens, I always have to swear at Spunkmeyer for leaving the dropship and wandering around on an alien-infested planet. He ruined everything!",1363478400,2,1473,4.424354243542435
1955459,5,B0000VCZK2,"In this set you'll get the theatrical & director's cuts for all movies.  Picture and sound quality are great.  All of the excellent bonus features from previous releases are present, plus a few more that sweeten the deal.  Nothing in the extras feels like filler.  I wish other studios would treat their franchises this well.

Big-box retailers sell this set from anywhere from $50-$80.  Unless some store has a better price, you probably won't see it any cheaper than here.

I'd hardly consider it to be the best part, but the packaging is much less annoying than the ""Alien Quadrillogy"" box set, too.",1363392000,,602,4.786407766990291

1955471,5,B0000VCZK2,"It had been years since I've watched any of the ""Alien"" movies so grabbing this set at a great price on Amazon made my day. I thought the studio did a great job at maintaining the integrity of the original film while ensuring top notch quality for this blu-ray release. I'm a sucker for bonus features and the interviews/making of's did not disappoint. They offer great insight into the design elements of all the films as well as some of the technical hurdles that were overcome to bring one of the coolest monster designs (IMO) to life. There's a reason this anthology is on most ""must have blu-ray"" lists.",1363305600,,608,4.587155963302752
1955472,5,B0000VCZK2,"Alien and Aliens are both classic films. Alien is a fantastic slow-burn horror/sci-fi film, and Aliens is a perfect sci-fi/action film.

1955474,4,B0000VCZK2,"First and foremost this is the definitive alien set.  It's got incredible extras, theatrical and director cuts of the movies, and is just amazing.  Even the case is pretty damn neat.

The problem is a niggling technical issue.  20th Century Fox has gone out of its way to place more restrictive DRM on its bluray movies.  This makes playback on PCs difficult.  Interestingly enough, it absolutely DOES  NOT make ripping the damn things any more complicated, just watching them.  You know, watching the movies you've already payed for.  With money.

The solution is to either download a bluray rip, rip a copy for yourself, or pay for a janky, overpriced piece of proprietary software like PowerDVD.

The point is, what the hell kind of benefit is this DRM if it only punishes people who went out and bought the movie, when they could have downloaded the stupid thing much more quickly, easily, and cheaply.

As a customer it's a bad feeling to not be able to view something I paid for.  Knock this DRM  [ *** ] off.",1363219200,,1015,4.629213483146067

1955480,2,B0000VCZK2,"First time I ordered this box set the first film in the series was defective and would severely skip around mid film. I returned it to Amazon and received a set that looked worse for wear. I was very impressed by the packaging the first time I received it, but the second one has a lot of scratches and dings all over the packaging and it looks like it's been dropped a couple of times, it even looks as though it might have been returned at one time. I'm not going to go through the hassle of returning it again and waiting patiently for a new copy to arrive hoping that it isn't as aesthetically unpleasing as the last time, or worse discover that it doesn't work properly. I'm pretty OCD when it comes to my things though, and I might just end up sending this box set back for one that isn't as scratched and dinged up. I've spent thousands shopping through amazon, and this is the first time that I've been very unimpressed by them. I hope it doesn't become a habit. If I discover the films to be defective I will definitely return it and get my money back pronto. I have significantly scaled back my purchases from amazon since they've started to charge sales tax in my home state of Texas, it seems that they're starting to give me even more good reason to shop from their online competitors who don't charge shipping or sales tax. I love you amazon, but please stop breaking my heart.

As far as the films are concerned, Aliens is one of the most epic sagas out there. Sci-Fi done right. Last two films aren't as great as the first two though.",1362528000,,1550,4.326460481099656

The helmet sequence in the begining with all of its weird sound affects really jolted you out of your seat and this series done here in stunning blue-ray and 5.1surround sound will knock your socks off,for real. This is a must for all you sci-fi buffs,because this series of films are the ones that raised the bar,and plus Sigourney Weaver is a goddess hero in all these films,and she really kicks alien butt big time with fantastic action. It starts out with Alien,the first of the series,well acted ,great characters and acting,really well done story. Then came Aliens,done masterfully by James Camron,a sequel that was worthy of the original and even better. The action is none stop with multipul aliens plus the Queen of all the aliens,hold onto your seat because your in for one incredible ride and you'll never want to get off! The other two are a little dark ,they are a little too edgy, but they fit in with the first two,I personally like the original and sequel better,but thats just me,so enjoy and re-live great movie making,thanks,Mark",1362355200,,1175,4.681159420289855

The film is shadowy, lots of darkness, and there are many shots that we've never seen clearly before.  I've never seen, or at least noticed, such a difference between a DVD and a Blu-ray disc.

1955536,5,B0000VCZK2,"There  are  only a  few  motion pictures ever  made,  that
can make a claim  to  science-fiction-horror  royalty !!

Three  visionary  directors, Ridley  Scott, James Cameron,  and
David Fincher ( The Game) bring  storytelling to  a  sharp  edge,
in these three  movies  based  on  characters  conceived  by
writing / producing team Dan O'Bannon and  Ronald  Shusett.

Master James Whale  set  the  benchmark  in 1935, with  ""The Bride  of
Frankenstein"".  Irving  Pichel set the  bar  again,  in  1950  with his
"" Destnation: Moon"".  Rudolph  Mate'  set  it  even  higher  with  ""When
Worlds  Collide"" in  1951.  Fred Mcleod  Wilcox took the  crown in  1956,
when  he  turned  in  ""Forbidden  Planet"".  Stan Kubrick ripped  the  crown
away from  Wilcox  in  1968's "" 2001: A Space Odyssey"".

""ALIEN"" set  the  bar  once  again,  in  1979, as  Ridley  Scott proved
that  you  don't  need  ""big name"" actors  to tell a  scary  story.

Cameron  took  that  theme, with  ""ALIENS"" in  1986.

David Fincher's  sense  of visual storytelling came  to the  screen  in
1992's  ""ALIEN 3"".

Own the  box  set, and  be  terrified  for  hours!!  Get your popcorn
ready,  folks !!

See, I was expecting the movies & some extras that's all. When I got it I was astonished on how heavy it is! The whole thing is built  like a book & you flip thru each story(movie), with pics in between. Now when I watched Alien I could swear the movie came out this year2013!! Its that clear. All the others are that clear, its just Alien is so old, it was done well & its been years since I've seen it. I still haven't gotten to all the extras cause there are hours on hours of extras plus I still want to watch the 2nd versions of the films, but 1 of the kool functions the extras has is being able to put all the stuff you like from all the disks in 1 file & in 1 spot. NICE ;)  Also, when you finish a movie you can pop it out, pop the next one in without going thru any menus or trailers.

1955597,3,B0000VCZK2,"I remember seeing Alien in 1979 at the theater with my (then 20 year old) buddies and as I recall it was a blast.
By the time Aliens showed up in 1986 my tastes in movies had somewhat changed, but waxing poetic for Alien I still saw it in the theater.
I was not overly impressed with Aliens. There was nothing new, just more Alien which is not necessarily a bad thing but as I said my tastes had changed.
In 1992 when Alien 3 was released it was not on my movie watching radar at all, and in 1997 when Alien Resurrection was released I figured it was just a last gasp money grab from a dead franchise.
Over the years I saw bits and pieces of these movies but I do not recall ever seeing them from start to finish before.
Then 2012 rolls around and Prometheus arrives.
Even though I am not a horror fan I am a sci-fi junkie so anything with a spaceship in it at a minimum gets a check out.
With very mixed reviews on Prometheus I was skeptical but mildly interested and since you can rent on Blu-Ray for a $1 locally I decided to give it a spin.
The Alien Anthology Blu-Ray package also happened to be on sale for $19.99 locally so I figured what the heck, it's cheap, so I bought it and planned a Alien movie marathon for myself.
I had read that the Alien movies look very good on Blu-Ray, I try not to overstate things like that but after watching the movies IMHO using the word amazing to describe the transfer is appropriate. I don't know how they did it but the video is a home run.
The Alien movie may look better on BD than it did in the original theater release.
Everything good that can be written about the movies has already been said.
I know I am a `well seasoned' movie watcher and the horror genre is not my thing but keeping that in my mind as I write this, I just don't understand the overwhelming majority of ratings being 5 stars.
Don't get me wrong, these are good enough movies, they stand up to time well enough, and they are all worth seeing...
Bottom line is I enjoyed all of the movies and watching them back-to-back-to-back was the best way for me to do it.
More like one very long sci-fi horror flick than five.
No need to watch Prometheus first, and in fact if I had a do over I would have watched it last, even though it is supposed to be the prequel it is a stand alone movie and since it has been 20+ years since I have seen it, Alien would have been better if I had watched it first.
Bottom line for me, these are fun movies and worth a spin on a cold rainy day.
On a 5 star scale I give the package 3 stars (including Prometheus) and I give Alien 4 stars because it is the concept movie and was ground breaking when it was released.",1359244800,,2663,4.103448275862069

It did drone on but was very interesting to hear about all the problems with management, technology ect. that they encountered when making these movies. I came away with the impression that I felt I could really understand why Hollywood actors/actresses are anti-business after seeing some of the BS that they have to put up with in making a movie.

They are being packed up and shipped to family as a 'care package'. This is the collection to own. The transfers were pristine. Shadows, colors etc. just seemed to pop and I almost felt as I did when I first saw these in the theater. The addition of the extras were great and added to the experience. The packaging was compact and interesting to say the least and would be of most value to collectors.
It is nice to have everything accessible in one package.
Cons: The out takes were difficult to see any difference from those left in the final movie...a secondary audio channel explanation would have been nice. My personal taste, didn't care too much for A3. Seemed to drag and tho some ends were tied up, left me with a ""been there, done that"" feeling. But good to have. A4: What now? Now that she is on Earth?.....
The negatives don't take away from the value or the sheer enjoyment of watching these in HD. I highly recommend this and I found the best price here on Amazon.

It also came 1-2 days early.",1357084800,,198,4.5

1955749,5,B0000VCZK2,"I chose this rating for the simple fact that this is Hollywood at it's finest.  I am definately a David Fincher fan.  The David fincher sequel was terrible due to its non existent script.  Also the CGI alien was a first and pretty lame.  The whole ""from the alien"" perspective was the best part about the movie.  This was like a helmet camera attatched to the head of the alien.  The underwater scene was amazing as well.  I just was really bummed about the lousy Fincher sequel.  Very pre-fight clubby dark wet and grimey.  This whole box set is amazing though!  This set is built for true film fanatics and aspiring film career enthusiasts!  Worth every penny!  Sigourney acted and looked Just like an alien when she ressurected!  Her acting is triumphant.  I wish she would make out with me one day.  How many times can you end a movie the same way though?  Come on Hollywood....enough with the alien sneaking back on the spaceship at the end of all four films.  I see it happening in Alien V also.  Spend the money, just know this thing is like a dictionary on your shelf.  Four unique directors for one believable encounter.",1357084800,,1129,4.527363184079602

1955766,5,B0000VCZK2,"I bought this as I have been a huge fan of ""Alien"" & ""Aliens"" since I first was allowed to watch them in my youth... Being a Sci-Fi / horror lover, and the limited number of ""Descent"" movies in this genre... when ythis popped up as a gold box deal for 20 bucks I jumped all over it.

This movie set is definitely for the ""Alien"" series fan, but I have yet to actually open and watch any of the disks. If you are new to ""Alien"" movies.. the first one is slower and more suspenseful, the seond one is pretty much non-stop action and fighting (my personal favorite) all the movies after ""Aliens"" (the seond one) were ok as far as continuing RIpley's saga, but tend to drop off in entertainment value and story quality...

That said if you are indeed new to this series you may want to watch the first and second movies to determine if it is even your bag... if you do not get into either of those you probably wouldn't like the series as a whole. I say watch the first 2 however beacause they will give you a completely different feel for hoew this series was set up...",1356912000,,1066,4.195121951219512

But I was hooked after seeing the origial Alien in the movies.

1955769,5,B0000VCZK2,"Though the series got a bit weaker after the second film, the bleak vision of a future dominated by unscrupulous corporations and filled with slimy xenomorphs has stood the test of time, and still stands as seminal material in the science fiction canon. Every steely-eyed space marine of the last twenty years owes his existence to Ripley and hicks, and every nasty alien owes a debt to H.R. Giger",1356825600,,397,4.768115942028985

1955772,5,B0000VCZK2,"I bought this for my brother who was happy about getting them.  The biggest thing about this purchase is the actual transaction.  I got it as a lightning deal and was happy until I saw that the price had dropped by $5 later in the day.  I tried to cancel it so I could re-order at the lower price but was unable to do so.  I wrote to Amazon asking to get reimbursed for the $5 which they did.  Normally if I missed a deal I would chalk it up to bad timing but this was aggravating since the price drop was only a couple hours later.  This was going to be the ""make it or break it"" deal for me regarding my prime membership and I'm happy to say Amazon came through.  They handled it professionally and 100% to my satisfaction.

As far as the movies go, the Alien movies are great and I look forward to seeing them in Blu-ray at my brother's house!",1356825600,,846,4.054216867469879

I purchased the British, region free, import (I live in the U.S.) due to the super low price and have had absolutely no problems playing any of the discs on my PS3 (PS3 purchased in 2011, 160 GB version).  The case is plastic, not cardboard, with all of the discs in one large blu-ray case, with plastic disc ""pages.""  I highly recommend the import, especially due to the fact that the import was about 1/2 the price as the US version when I bought it, and contains all of the same content.",1356480000,,751,4.445255474452555

1955828,5,B0000VCZK2,"This was all I could hope for!  Fantastic deal, great product, perfect for a Christmas Sci-Fi marathon! I would strongly suggest it.",1356393600,,132,5.0
1955829,4,B0000VCZK2,"These are the only Alien movies that are really worth watching.  The first two, Alien and Aliens being the best of the set.  While I do not think Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection were bad I just really think they tried too hard to extend the story.  The first two are really are a mix of classic monster and sci-fi genres.  Personally I think the best part of the set are the extras.  Even if you do not like the third and fourth movies as much as the other two, the behind the scenes material gives a lot of insight into the stories, and probably makes them more enjoyable.  I do think throughout all the movies Sigourney Weaver did a great job making the character of Ripley evolve because of all that she experienced.

If you are a fan of the movies (aside from the alien vs predator films) this is definitely worth a pick-up.  There is now a blu ray version that you may want to get instead that contains all the extras from this set, but even as a DVD set this looks and sounds great.  It should be a part of any fan's collection.",1356393600,,1033,4.2030456852791875

I just couldn't pass up the opportunity to own the definitive collection of all the Alien movies on Blu-ray on such a low price of $20.

1955833,4,B0000VCZK2,"My review is strictly on the quality of the set and not a review of the films. Sorry but these are fairly old films that you can find plenty of review of. Getting to the good stuff: The quality of the movies have to be seen to be believed, especially for the first two films. The remastering has brought the original up to the standards of today's releases and I can say this with full confidence: The first movie looks like it was shot in modern day. Clarity, Image Sharpness, Color and Audio make it feel like this is a movie trying to imitate an old production.  Aliens' quality is also pretty darn good but not as eye catching as the original for some reason. Aliens is also presented in Full Screen rather than wide screen like the rest of the films. As for Aliens 3 and Aliens Resurrection, I had a pretty hard time hearing a lot of dialogue in Aliens 3. Other than that no gripes about it's quality. Resurrection had it's share of audio trouble but it still wasn't as bad as Aliens 3. There is also another disk in the collection that is more of a ""making of"" for the set but to be honest I haven't had time to watch it. So there you have it.",1356307200,,1149,4.199095022624435
1955834,5,B0000VCZK2,"If you've seen them before, this collection is worth getting on Blu-ray. No doubt, one of the best sci-fi series made! I never tire of watching these, along with Prometheus, over and over again.",1356307200,,194,4.735294117647059

1955848,5,B0000VCZK2,"If you already own the Alien movies in DVD or are considering upgrading to Blu-ray, this set will certainly not dissapoint you. All four movies are presented in flawless HD Blu-ray picture and sound, including additional versions and material within the movies and additonal discs. The book like case offers a beautiful presentation of 'pages' for each disc with scene pictures from each movie. The additional material truly adds depth to the whole Alien saga, from production, storyboards, interviews with cast and crew, storyline concepts, just about everything that made the Alien saga the classic it has become.
Price wise it was a bargain to get this set at the price offered here at Amazon. You might not find a better offer anywhere else for this collection, even more so if you get the movies piecemeal which will not have the added discs and bonus material included with this set. If you enjoyed this movies at the theatre or on DVD, then you owe it to yourself to add this set to your Sci-Fi collection.",1356220800,,1013,4.7942857142857145

The other three are great, although Alien 3 starts out as a bummer, but I don't want to spoil it for the one person who has not yet seen that film.  Just be warned that its starts out depressing.

Alien 3 changed the aliens' appearance but the fearful nervousness was still evident in this David Fincher-directed 3rd installation.  Alien Resurrection was the ""gimme"" movie of the Anthology.  Not well written, I would rate it as average at best.  But the Anthology set is great!  Fantastic artwork, packaging, and the holographic-like alien on the front and egg on the back are impressive.  Blu Ray picture and sound are incredible, as the digital transfer was very well done.  Highly recommended set, especially if you're a fan of these movies!",1355616000,,605,5.05050505050505

I frequent a site called blu-ray.com which has thorough and (in my experience) accurate reviews for most blu ray titles.  I fully agree with their assessment that the transfers were very well done and the picture was fantastic.  I viewed on a 70"" Sharp Aquos and found the quality to be stunning.

Of course, the third and fourth movies are simply not nearly as good as the first two but that is also obviously something I knew before buying the set.",1355616000,,584,4.2342342342342345

There were two bonus discs that talked at lenght of just about every aspect of the movies such as set construction, casting, how they got Weaver to come back for three sequels, interviews with H.R. Giger, etc...
  Also when changing discs Weyland Corporation logo apears on screen till the next disc is loaded taking less time for you marathon lovers.  All the discs are in a booklet which is really nice with stil shots in between the pages.

This is the best packaging I have seen(excluding ultimate edition boxed sets) of any blu ray discs. The outer slip cover is very sturdy,and the book pages are 2mm thick cardboard. The only fault with this set is the book containing the discs fits too tight( top to.bottom) and hence wears the gloss colored edging off both ends - back to white cardboard after only 2 or 3 removals.

While the first two movies are without question a masterpiece, the other two movies in the set are lacking. Aliens 3 being the worse movie of the four (in my opinion) but is still watchable and does have a few moments of brilliance and originality. If you're considering getting this set in regards to the new release of Prometheus then you only need to get the first movie entitled Alien to understand and get caught up on the references in Prometheus.

I give the set 4 stars because the movies and mythos is great however the packing is lacking. While beautiful, the collection is set so that the blu-rays ""slide"" out of the sleeve.

I had to spend hours trying to get amazon to give me back the difference in price. Apparently they don't price match their own prices even if you just bought the item 30-60 minute earlier. I did get a ""one time exception"", but the process was very frustrating and I would urge anyone making purchases through the email notifications to double check the pricing before making the final purchase or you could be out a lot more than 5 dollars.

1956010,5,B0000VCZK2,The movies are beautiful and was a really great value. The onlt down side was the paper box that it came in. I wish it was a box that I ddn't think I was going to break.,1355616000,,169,3.5945945945945947
1956011,5,B0000VCZK2,I love this box set. I have watched every thing on all nine discs and enjoyed every second. A lot more stuff than I thought I was buying. Great buy!,1355529600,,148,3.966666666666667

1956014,5,B0000VCZK2,This has to be the best conversion from DVD to blu-ray I have EVER seen! I had the Alien Quadrilogy dvd box set and I sold it because this is absolutely an AWESOME box set. The picture quality from comparing the dvd to blu ray is like no other. You can see the detail of everything crystal clear! Like before on aliens even on the dvd it seemed a little grainey at times. Well it got cleaned up with this transfer. I could go on but this is the MUTHUR of all Blu-Ray sets and the SIXTY extra hours of special features and TWO bonus discs UN-FREAKING BELIEVABLE! I have NEVER seen this many extras on ANY box set before it!,1355356800,,622,4.148760330578512

1956016,5,B0000VCZK2,Ok I admit I had not seen any of the Alien movies prior to purchasing this but I am so happy I bought this!  The movies are awesome in Blu ray.  Great picture and great sound.  I am not one of the people that is unhappy when they upgrade movies to Blu ray and even add parts etc.  I know a lot are.  It seems to me that this set is good for both kinds as the original theatrical release is an option or you can choose the other version.  I am that person that is excited about getting Star Wars on Blu ray.  Different likes for different people.  I like the movies a lot.  I would recommend this and the price is great on Amazon.,1355270400,,629,3.9285714285714284
1956017,5,B0000VCZK2,I was in the market for this exact set when Amazon sent me a notification via the gold box.  I ordered in seconds.  The low price was impossible to pass up.  Great box set and of course the movies are fantastic.,1355270400,,211,4.097560975609756

1956020,5,B0000VCZK2,I got this because of the price and because I needed more blu rays. The movie quality is great for its time.,1355184000,,108,3.9545454545454546
1956021,5,B0000VCZK2,Blue-ray really adds to the visual action and enjoyment of the Alien series. Excellent quality. Only negative would be no extras included - just 3 DVD's in a colorful box.,1355184000,,171,4.733333333333333
1956022,3,B0000VCZK2,I bought this to replace my older individual DVD's and get everything into one box set. The video and sound is what you would expect for the age of the movies. Do not expect 7.1 surround sound.,1355184000,,193,4.243243243243243
1956023,5,B0000VCZK2,Really was looking forward to this one as I have always been a fan of the Aliens series.  I must say that the packaging is very nice and the extras are a great plus.  Though I must admit I really and mostly interested in the footage from the 1st 2 movies.,1355184000,,255,3.980392156862745

1956025,5,B0000VCZK2,"BluRay transfer was well done. Clear and crisp picture. I don't have a sound system, so I cannot comment too indepth with regards to sound, but the audio on from the tv was adequate. I love these movies, the first two especially, and seeing them in this format was a little like seeing them again for the first time. Well worth the purchase on BluRay from my perspective, and I loved the special features that were collected for this release.",1355097600,,442,4.5375
1956026,5,B0000VCZK2,"I recently had to upgrade my Alien collection from standard DVDs to Blue Ray format.  The Alien saga is a must have. I grew up with the original Alien in the 80s. Its the original sci-fi Horror movie and nothing today has ever come close to topping it. And never will, as Alien is truly the Godfather of all sci-fi  movies today. This collection is nice to havewhat else is there to say, accept buy it now!",1355011200,3,406,4.259740259740259
1956027,3,B0000VCZK2,"It was worth the price, and the extra footage was nice, but the latter movies were bad and the make-of's for them just made me hate them more.

They showed less of the deleted scenes from the first film in the deleted-scenes section than other parts of the making-of videos.",1355011200,,274,4.48
1956028,5,B0000VCZK2,"One of my favorite movie(s). The set was OK, Amazing picture and sound quality. Lots of extras (see the other reviews). Worth the money, IMO.",1355011200,,141,4.68
1956029,5,B0000VCZK2,"I have watched these movies over and over again, and I started watching them as a young boy.  This set is a must-have.  If you enjoy The alien movies as much as I do, you will be glad you bought this box set.",1355011200,,208,3.813953488372093
1956030,5,B0000VCZK2,Had to have this highly rated disc collection.  This is the ultimate Alien collection for all the Alien fans out here.,1354924800,,118,4.619047619047619
1956031,5,B0000VCZK2,Viewing this in Blu Ray and in the special edition made the series have so much more sense.  Especially as I had purchased and viewed Prometheus.  Crisp color.,1354924800,,159,4.642857142857143
1956032,5,B0000VCZK2,"Four great movies, two special feature disks and the coolest blu ray case out there.  Well worth every penny.
  Yes alien 3 and 4 aren't as great as the first two but don't let that stop you from watching them.  They are still part of a great anthology and worth anyones time.",1354838400,,276,4.25
1956033,5,B0000VCZK2,"My husband is an avid fan of the ALIEN anthology series. That is of course aside from the fact that he fancies Sigourney Weaver. It so happens that his birthday was fast approaching so I thought of the best gift that I could possibly give to him.

I found the alien anthology collection and I was so thrilled to realize that I finally knew what to give my husband on his 60th birthday. To make sure that I will have the best gift to give to my husband, I actually read the reviews that I found at the site. Even though not all of them may give a positive review. Most of them do just and that is good enough for me.",1354838400,,615,4.040983606557377
1956034,5,B0000VCZK2,"I decided to pick this up, honestly only for Alien and Aliens. Alien 3 and Alien:Resurrection are two movies I don't care for, but at the price, it was worth having the whole collection.

What I didn't realize was how great the packaging is. Not simply 4 blu ray cases that slip into a box. The box contains a hard book with the 4 discs inserted within the pages. Each page contains artwork from the different pages and is simply gorgeous to flip through.

The quality of the picture and sound is great. I was afraid that because of the price, they quality of the transfer would be poor. I've experienced this with some ""bargain"" blu rays in the past. Now, keep in mind, I've only watched the first two, but the quality is great! Full, high def, blu ray presentation. Very well done!

If you are a fan of any (or even ALL) of the Alien franchise, I highly recommend this set.",1354838400,,875,4.355828220858895

1956037,5,B0000VCZK2,"Got this on a sale for $20, no brainer.  Theatrical and collector's cuts of the films with tons of extras.  Alien in blu-ray...amazing.  Ridley Scott is a genius.",1354752000,,162,4.714285714285714
1956038,5,B0000VCZK2,"I am always looking for a deal on Blu-ray. The Alien Anthology was one I really wanted. Currently the set is on sale for $30.99 with Prime (free if member) shipping.

Movies- These are classics which have been brought up to high def standards. I really enjoy the different versions on the disks along with the introductions. It really puts one in the mindset of directors. The disks are missing the first movie Prometheus which came out in 2012. Additionally, these videos carry over into the Predator series including Predator vs Aliens. Watch all of them starting here with the Alien Anthology.

1956041,5,B0000VCZK2,"First, I do not know why I am seeing so many 1 star reviews that are just reviewing ONE movie. Yes yes we all know the Prison Planet (3rd) movie was horrible. But this is specially for the Aline Quad set with all the extra  bonuses.

That being said, this 9 disk set is great for the Aliens fan. Even though I already had all the Alien movies except 3 I got this box set. I love all the extras and on mine I did not have any problem with sound or any off dubbing so I am not sure what is going on with that one guys copy. Perhaps his copy is a fake. I 'm just saying.

So in conclusion, this would make a awesome gift for anyone who is a fan of the series with enough bonus material on each movie to keep them occupied for days.",1354752000,,728,3.84

1956052,4,B0000VCZK2,"Good quality and remaster of the the first 2.

The set's box is designed to look like a book out of cardboard. You either love it or hate it.
The con is the ""discs mount"" design, which are actually sleeves in the cardboard book/case.

That being said, I also bought this last year for $60.00 for myself, and do not regret paying the price at all.  The set comes in a beautifully done box, with an awesome, sturdy book.  Each disc is held in its own page, with each page having a perfectly picked picture encompassing each corresponding movie.

1956065,5,B0000VCZK2,"Excellent package. I know that the 1st Alien might be vintage and slow if you compare with Prometheus. Even the special effects are simple but I doesn't shows extreme signs of aging. When you watch the deleted scenes and watch the extra discs maybe you reach my conclusion. Aliens, Alien3 and Alien resurrection are disposable. Alien franchise must stop with the 1st movie. Truly masterpiece. If the cocoon scene has not been deleted an Alien Queen might be unnecessary and the original Ripley might be still living in our minds and the stupid Alien Versus Predator never exists for our grace.
H.R. Giger is more frightening than any alien. He is so clever and bold but he might say every day Mirror mirror on the wall who is the spooky of them all... And the Mirror might be speechless indeed.",1353974400,,794,4.678571428571429
1956066,5,B0000VCZK2,"This product is an incredible deal. Blu rays go from anywhere between $19-35 usually. They remastered this and they quality is incredible, even the first movie that was made in 1979 is blu ray quality! For $20 you get all four original alien movies in blu ray quality. With over 60 hours of bonus footage, and a cool book- like case with pictures in it to house the Blu rays, it doesn't he much better than this. The Blu rays are located in this hardcover book thing inside the box, and they slip in their little pockets. Which are very secure, and you don't have to pop them out of that little plastic piece you push down on to release your disks, which is nice, since they can be scratched by those things.

This is a must have for any Alien fan. Or even for that someone you know who loved the movie Prometheous, and has never seen the Alien movies, would like this. And even if you have seen them, if you he ths set along with Prometheous you will pick up a lot of similarities , and continuations between the movies! You'll enjoy these movies all over again with the added benefit of blu ray! Enjoy!",1353974400,,1104,4.3076923076923075

1956068,5,B0000VCZK2,"There is nothing missing from this set! I was a bit hesitant on getting this set as it basically gave the same ""inclusions"" of my ""Quadrilogy"" set. I was in for a BIG surprise. The mere fact that dual layer blus ray discs are used in containing all the info of not just the ""Quadrilogy"" set, but every set I have owned! Plus the added ""MU-TH-UR"" Mode which basically takes you to all the extra scenes not available on ""Quadrilogy"" such as many ""ad libbed"" scenes between Yafet Kotto & Harry Dean Stanton in ""Alien"". The quality is unsurpassed (so far)! I actually like all 4 movies being so different and never boring!

If you are an Alien fan like myself, you will LOVE this set! The packaging is a bit of a pain. Remember that blu ray discs are more durable and less apt to be scratched. Even with the glossy slip sleeves included to make the set as compact as possible. If they were DVD's, they couldn't handle these sleeves. The only set back is getting the inner ""book of discs"" in the main box is a pain to get out and in due to a ledge on the book that holds the discs. This is a minor problem and does ruin the discs as they sit safely in place. I am sure in time, the ledge will get damaged but when I watch the novies, I just keep the book out of the box housing. All in all, this is a great set and I got it at an incredible price through Amazon! Amazon is simply the best!",1353888000,,1384,4.107011070110701
1956069,5,B0000VCZK2,"Great Price, picked it up on sale at Amazon for $19.99 can you beat that for every version of the films released lots of great extras that have not been put on previous special editions and a true classic set of films.",1353801600,,218,4.214285714285714
1956070,1,B0000VCZK2,"If You want to keep these movies for a private collection, and never open them; then this is the set for you. If you want to enjoy the classics again and again, then you better be very careful getting your discs out of the awful packaging. My first movie is already scratched just by trying to get it out of the package.
  I don't really know what is going on with the brains of some designers today. They want to design and redesign and screw  things all over again.
  Why not stay with one package format? why can't we be just simple?
  So this is what I'm Going to do: I will transfer all of my Alien collection to classic blu ray cases and search online for the  sleeve cover of every single movie. Then I'm going to print them and insert them into the classic blu ray cases I already have; then I'm going to send this stupid package to the recycle container. Perhaps like that, I could keep the real classic treasure safe: The actual Blu rays movies.
  So buyers beware! The package although very heavy, fancy and classy is in fact useless for the well care of the disc itself.
  For all those who complain about my review: I tell you before hand, I'm not reviewing the movies but the package in which the movies are kept. The movies are 5 stars, otherwise I would not have bought them. but the packaging 0 Stars. There would be those who differ, but this was my experience.",1353801600,19,1379,4.3023255813953485

1956072,4,B0000VCZK2,"I purchased this collection because the price was right. I coudn't have purchased a single blue ray edition of even one of these movies for what i paid for the  entire collection.
  I really like the extra's in movies,especially the making of featurettes and this had plenty of minutes for all 4 movies.
  Rating the movies would have to be Aliens,Alien,Alien Resurrection and then Alien 3. I watched ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" on DVD and it was great but in this case i noticed a definate quality change in the picture and especially the sound and usually it's not worth it because i don't pick up on alot of those changes.
  I don't know if they will ever offer this set for the low price i paid ($19.95) again but i think it was definately worth it. You might be able to buy it used for that price but i'm not sure.
  A little bit of a spoiler, if you do decide to purchase this set watch the extra's for ""Alien Resurrection"" -the basketball scene has a shocker of a surprise in it!",1353715200,,979,4.335164835164835

1956078,5,B0000VCZK2,"We bought this set for $20 and only watched the first Alien movie so far, but this has been well worth the purchase price.
-
I've only seen Alien on TV whenever it was on and watching the Blu-Ray version was like watching a completely different movie.  The Blu-Ray version is just that much cleaner, crisper and detailed.  There is absolutely no graininess and it looks like it was a recently made movie, not one made in 1979.  Of course, the technology on-board the ship gives the age of the movie away though :) Oh and this was also the first time I saw the Director's Cut so that was cool since there were a few scenes that were new to me.

The entire set comes as sort of a book casing with the discs embedded in its pages.  It works out, I don't see any issue with it and aesthetically it looks pleasing with the rest of our DVD collection.

There's some kind of a special feature you can turn on which was kind of confusing so we haven't explored it yet.

This is a great bargain for fans of the franchise! (Or for even those who like the first two movies, like me)",1353456000,2,1071,4.195121951219512
1956079,5,B0000VCZK2,"the only complaint I have is how you take the blu rays out of each slot, I get scarred the disc will get scratched when taking the movie in and out of the case, it's not like the ordinary Blu Ray Case where you just pop up the disc.  thats my only complaint other then that the movies are great and the case has cool designs on it.",1353456000,,331,3.8676470588235294
1956080,5,B0000VCZK2,"I have to say this collection is simply great!! far beyond my expectations. The packing is just gorgeous, in a book format, with great pictures and that, simply perfect. Each disc contains two version of the movies, the original untouched, and the remastered version with new scenes, which I didn't know, and that's also a fantastic plus. The quality of the original version is what it should be, no so great, not so bad, just like an old movie, and about the remaster, I like the fact that still preserve that old look like, but looks definitely better. Nothing to say about the sound, which is great, but I haven't tested properly yet.

The only disgusting thing about this collection is that requires and update of your player due to new AACS keys or something like that, wich sucks of curse, but hey, is not that bad anyway. I use two blu ray software players (totalmedia and powerdvd) and both of them, after the update, where able to play it without problems.

Another thing that I liked about this version, is that you only have one short f@@@@n fbi warnning that, of curse, you cannot jump, and then you go right to the movie, unlike other blu rays were you have like one minute of crap that you have to brook.

So, great collection, totally worth the money (especially 20 bucks that is what I paid)",1353456000,,1307,4.529661016949152

1956082,4,B0000VCZK2,Bought this set after watching Prometheus. I loved the movie and had never watched the older ones. I'm not big on most older movies usually but these movies did not disappoint.

1956085,5,B0000VCZK2,"I remember back years ago I bought the Alien Quadrilogy on DVD, and it was the best set for this franchise, completely surpassing the previous box set at the time which was Alien Legacy, and this set takes the quadrilogy to a whole new level.

Obviously the biggest improvement is the video and audio clarity, and the transfers on the quadrilogy dvds were spectacular, but of course these transfers are way better, and these are really great movies to show off on blu-ray, because of the sets, the ships, and the creatures, Alien is the one that REALLY shines, especially the shots of the Nostromo in the very beginning, you can see every line, every detail on the exterior of the ship, and the inside looks fantastic as well, this film had a lot of white on the sets, and with this transfer, the sets just come alive, and you get two versions of the film just like in the quadrilogy, I always watch the theatrical cut because it's what I grew up with, but the special edition is good too, and the audio is top notch, it's really loud and crisp, but not overdone, which happens a lot.

Now I'm not reviewing the movies themselves because all fans of this franchise knows this is a great saga, now onto Aliens, the transfer on this one is excellent too, right off when you see the shuttle head up into the salvage station, man oh man, the details shown are just incredible, and when Ripley is first taken to the station medical center, those shots of the outside with all the ships flying around the station, oh my, the lights, the ships just stand right out, practically jump off the screen, and the Sulaco mother ship looks outstanding as well as the drop ship, what I said about the transfer on Alien will pretty much sum up all of them, which is pretty amazing seeing that 3 of these films are 20+ years old, and of course you get two versions of this film as well.

Now onto Alien 3, I always thought this one was really underrated, it's not on par with Alien or Aliens of course, but on it's own, it's a great film I found, but I'm not reviewing the movies, this transfer is no different than the first 2, it is so clear and crisp, but what really shines about this one is the 2003 restored workprint version, it was featured on the quadrilogy, but it really didn't look or sound that great on the cut scenes, this one however, thanks to blu-ray technology, looks and sounds like the theatrical cut all the way through, it doesn't feel like you're watching two different movies like the DVD version, and while I love the theatrical version, I must say that this time, the extended cut is better, there is more of the story with some key elements that add to the plot, this is the one that should have been the final cut, I don't know why it was edited, the additional scenes add about a half hour.

Alien Ressurection is my least favorite of the franchise, but I still find it solid, this one really looks and sounds great, especially the space shots and the interior of the ship, and there is an extended cut of this one too, which is better, although it's only about 10 minutes longer.

Then you get to a bunch of excellent extras, first off, all the making of documentaries that were part of the quadrilogy are here as well, which was smart by fox, because they are great documentaries, but with this set, you get extras that weren't part of the quadrilogy if I remember right, like for instance 'The Alien Saga' which is a 2 hour documentary on the franchise, and 'Alien Evolution' which you get 2 versions of, each of which is an hour give or take, 'The Alien Legacy' which is about an hour all on 'Alien' plus a bunch more, theres so many I can't remember all of them.

Now the packaging, while the box and the book is absolutely beautiful, the fact that the disks slide in and out it's not something I really like doing, so I put them in some slip cases, everyone has their own preferences, but I personally do not like sliding any kind of disk, I'm always afraid it's going to scratch, but the box is gorgeous.

So all in all, this is the best this series has ever looked, and I don't think it will ever look any better, or sound any better, and with all the extras you get, this is a killer box set, and Amazon has it here for $20.00, which is a great buy, I paid $50.00 at Best Buy.

So get out there and get it!",1353369600,,4327,4.326757090012331

Though the final two movies weren't as successful or critically-acclaimed as the first two, the entire series is great as a whole and Sigourney Weaver is strong throughout.

This blu-ray set is awesome. The packaging is wonderful to look at and the discs are in pages like a book; no more having to fold out ten sections like in the previous Quadrilogy release. The movies look and sound great in high-definition, so much so that you'll see and hear things you missed in previous releases.

Not only is the packaging really sleek and cool, but the book-like DVD holders are awesome too. And that's not even mentioning the extensive bonus feature included with it all.

I'm sure most people will agree that the third and fourth movies did not meet the impossibly high bar set by the first two, but this anthology is well worth it for the wonderful extras (60 hours' worth) and the massive improvement in picture quality.

1956106,5,B0000VCZK2,"When I saw this on sale at Best Buy, it was a no-brainer.  This has to be one of the best collections of a movie series out there.  The package is strongly and neatly designed with a thick cardboard insert with eleven pages holding all four films and two extra discs - ""The making of the Alien Anthology"" and ""The Alien Anthology Archives"".  To say this set is exhaustive is a mild comment.  It is massive and stuffed to the hilt.  There is also a ""MU-TH-UR Mode Viewer's Guide"" and an explanation of the ""unbound"" experience that bridges your viewing between discs with `MU-TH-ER mode'.  The two deeply-loaded BD-50 discs packed full of supplements are fantastic.  Navigating through them is simple.  You can simply watch it straight through or use the `MU-TH-ER mode' to `tag' subjects.  This acts as a memory tag so you can come back later and watch those scenes.  This is handy in all six discs.

Each film has the theatrical version and the director's cut.  One of the great things about these versions is that the director's cut does not always include the same scenes or endings!  You can select a director's cut and choose to mark (a little checked box) to appear if the scene is deleted from the original.  It's amazing what they cut and left in.  ""Alien 3"" for example had a less violent ending in the director's cut than the theatrical cut, which seemed odd.  The ending of ""Alien Resurrection"" has a totally different ending in the director's cut.  And on it goes.  You can even watch several different angles of critical scenes, like when the alien pops out of John Hurt (it can be overkill - yuk, yuk).

The Blu-ray version is spectacular in detail and color and the 5.1 surround sound is crisp and perfectly balanced.  It is just a great repackaging!

I am impressed with the total packaging and figure I will eventually watch all seventy something hours of it over a long period of time.  I recommend you read the first three reviews here on Amazon.com, if you want more detailed information - or just go out and buy this monster set!",1351900800,6,2050,4.574175824175824

I'm so confused! Oh, wrong movie.

Is the studio just issuing crappy blu-ray copies?

We shall see. Wrong movie again.

I've noticed this same problem on some Star Trek movies from the UK too.

I never had any video quality issues until I started buying UK stuff for less.

Maybe you do get what you pay for - maybe not?

I will purchase the US versions for more, and do an A/B comparison. One is going back for a refund, or maybe both?

Blockbuster movies should always be copied from the original 4K masters. If not, then all are going to get returned. Issuing studio, are you listening?",1350777600,4,845,4.3312101910828025

1956119,5,B0000VCZK2,"Wow.  I saw Alien when I was a kid, during its original run.  It was the first R rated movie I ever saw.  For me, that was a big deal at the time.  I never forgot the experience.

When I watched this transfer of Alien I felt like I was both watching the movie again, and for the first time.  What I mean is, I knew the story, the characters, the scenes, etc. . .but I have never seen nor heard the film like this.  I have been buying a ton of blu-rays and enjoy the medium (and yes, old films, if properly restored, look much better on Blu-ray than upconverted DVD).  I own a variety of old movies on Blu-ray.  This restoration, however, is probably the best I have seen.  All of the restorations in this set are done pretty well, but Alien is just amazing - and it is the oldest of the lot and in my opinion, the best film of this series.  The other films look and sound very good as well, but do not appear to have received quite the same level of lavish restoration.  Even the popular sequel Aliens does not match the remastering of the original.  This set is well worth its cost and believe me, if you like the original Alien, this transfer will blow you away.",1349395200,,1164,4.12

Got it at around $30, which compared to getting them all new separately, ain't half bad. I'm not really big on Blu-Ray, and since these movies are probably too old for that to matter, it's a great deal. Comes with tons of DVDs, each movie having its own ""supplemental"", plus an extra one to wrap things up, giving you just as much bonus material, if not more, than movie material. I haven't gotten around to watching any of the supplementals yet, but it's a nice extra if I get the time to watch them. The only real downer is if you want to watch either Alien or Alien: Resurrection, not because they're bad, but because of the packaging. It's not a big complaint, and it all does look nice, but it folds out and with all the DVDs included, sprawls to about 5 feet in length!

It's probably the best designed Blu-Ray packaging I've seen to date, although I do really like the Lord of the Rings extended edition packaging. The discs are a little hard to get out of this anthology set, but it's not a big deal. As far as the movies themselves, they have retained the actual film grain, they look stellar on Blu-Ray and are really sharp and the detail looks great. Some of the best transfers I've seen.

1956130,5,B0000VCZK2,"I hope people will take the time to watch the 90-minute documentary ""Wreckage and Rage- Making Alien3"". First of all, anyone remotely interested in the art and politics of filmmaking owe it to themselves to see this incredibly revealing documentary that chronicles the making of the third film in the franchise and director David Fincher's trial-by-fire as he made his first studio film. Like many people, I've never warmed to the film (even the 1992 cut; a signficant restoration of Fincher's original vision of the story), but watching this documentary and seeing how *other* people, non-creative people, the ""bean counters"", can essentially take what is art and reduce to a product, a franchise, and all the other sterile terms that sucks the magic from movie-making and makes it the crass business that it is (the other great story is how Joseph L. Mankiewicz almost created a classic, perhaps a masterpiece, in ""Cleopatra"" only to see it eviscerated by studio suits and libidinous stars, but that's a tale for another day). And although I'm one of those people who doesn't usually want to know how the magic on the screen was created (I want to *believe*), the documentary does a wonderful job examining how the film was constructed, especially the set design and special effects creation. I finally understand why there are dozens of names in the credits rolling up the screen as the movie ends!

Perhaps Alien3 is an object lesson: perhaps any franchise does have an expiration date. Both ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" were genre defining films (that even Ridley Scott could not better in the underwhelming ""Prometheus""). That said, this documentary clearly demonstrates that a young, hungry director had a vision to take a hackneyed film genre and take it in a new, more human direction, and elevate both the human and non-human characters to a different plane of reference. In many ways, Fincher's ""Se7en"" is the Alien3 story brought to earth and the monster contained in a human form while the characters around it are still as empty and lost as the convicts in Fincher's grim prison world. I urge you to watch this documentary, and the watch the 1992 cut of the film. **Highly Recommended**",1346544000,,2192,4.956521739130435
1956131,3,B0000VCZK2,"I am a huge sci fi fanatic and decided to write this review after watching all of the movies from start to finish on blu ray. I'm 22 years old, I grew up on the old Lost in Space flicks, Star Trek, and the obvious Star Wars films. I also recently started watching old school flicks like Forbidden Planet. But one franchise I always kind of blew off were the Alien movies. I recently upgraded to a 42"" LG 1080p Flatscreen TV and to compliment it, I wanted to buy some blu ray movies to watch on it.
I surfed around on Amazon and see the ""Alien Anthology"" blu ray box set. A little pricey, but the packaging looked nice, the movies sounded fun to watch, and it was something entirely new that I never experienced yet. My dad is a big fan of the movies as well (at least the original two) It didn't take much thought before I decided to purchase these movies on blu ray!

Packaging/Shipping, this item took a little longer than expected to arrive and shipped separate from the rest of the things I ordered on Amazon Prime. But it came in excellent condition, no dents/abrasions on the box. Upon first inspection, the actual box is kind of difficult to open first time and you may have to bend the packaging a little to get the movies out. I think this could be avoided if they would simply put an open slot on the side of the box to open the box easy. But no biggie, I still like the packaging.
Once opened, the collection comes in a very nice ""booklet"" with all the movies nicely showcased with images and descriptions of each movie. The end of the booklet contains the collectors stuff like commentary and things. I am on the fence for the packaging. I really love it and it's different, but it is hard to open and I do get weary of wear and tear on the disc after a while, the sleeves they are in aren't that great.

The movies themselves, I will review and break down quick. One thing I would like to complain about (and one reason I felt like taking a star off for), the aspect ratio of these movies. Only ""Aliens"" (Alien 2 by James Cameron) is filmed in the advertised 2.35:1 ratio. This movie looked the best and filled my entire TV screen. The rest were filmed in the 1.85 ratio... depending on your TV screen size/aspect ratio/setup, maybe the films will look full screen to you, but three out of four films I had to watch with them goddamn annoying black bars on the top and bottom the screen! I hate that when I am already watching on a brand new widescreen TV! Yes, these were the way these films were originally shot, but they should label the technical specs better for these films. Now anyway for the actual movies...

ALIEN - 7/10
This is the original Alien movie. This was my third time watching the film and first time on Blu Ray. To many's surprise, I'm not that crazy about the original Alien film. In some ways it feels like a rip off of ""2001 Space Oddessy"". Still though, the aliens/special effects/camera work are excellent, this is a classic sci fi movie. The story line was good and it introduced us to Alien franchise.

ALIENS - 10/10
This movie, this was my first time watching it and I have to say this movie alone was worth buying the entire Alien Anthology collection for! This movie rocks. It's got James Cameron written all over it and the always lovable Bill Paxton really compliments this movie. Lovable characters, great camera work/lighting, intense horror scenes, well written script, and I like the aspect ratio it was shot in filling my whole TV. Picture quality, still had that grain but it was just right this time. The sound effects were better mixed in this one and the scary scenes jump out loud when they need to be without being too much. James Cameron knows how to do it right, this movie is a classic and I highly recommend it to anyone whether they are a sci fi fan or not.

ALIEN 3 - 6/10
This movie was a huge step back from the James Cameron classic. The plot/story sucks for very obvious reasons although I don't want to put spoilers on here. The camera work, special effects, story, and the rest of it, it just wasn't as good as James Cameron's ""Aliens"". Comparing to the original movie it's not as good as that either. This movie was jut bad. I seen it once and I don't want to see it again. Blu ray wise, this is probably among the best of the originals. The picture/sound quality are excellent. No more of that old school grain, everything looks like it's there and you can touch it. In 5.1 surround this movie rocks.

ALIEN 4 - 8/10
This movie is kind of it's own movie from the original trilogy. It doesn't tie in well with the originals but it's a great sci fi flick and I would watch it again. The camera work, acting, and story are far better than Alien 3 though in my opinion. This movie had the best blu ray quality of all the films. The picture quality is crystal clear, the sound is crystal clear with deep bass tones and rich sound quality well mixed with my 5.1 setup.

Overall I welcome these movies into my collection. But I am on the fence for the whole thing.  I try to rate these movies from a ""general audience"" stand point. If I am an average person looking to buy these movies for myself or another person as a gift that is not a sci fi fan, are they worth it? To be honest, no. I think the average person should just buy ""ALIENS"" (Alien 2), the sequel made my James Cameron. I cannot say enough good things about Aliens. It is a fun, re-watchable movie and ANY audience can enjoy and you can buy it alone on blu ray far cheaper than this entire box set.
The rest of these films, the sequels are mediocre. The third film is a train wreck. I feel like never watching it again, and that is a bad feeling to have when you buy a movie that is a permanent addition to your collection of movies.

Let me end the review with this. Before you buy, make sure you or the person you are buying these for is an Alien fan. These movies just aren't for everybody. I recommend renting them all and checking them out for yourself. If you think they are fun and you would watch them again over and over, then buy all means buy this box set. Also, if you don't care about that and/or you want the ""movie theater"" experience people that doesn't like ""streaming"" quality then buy all means, but this!
I'm a sci fi fan and I found these a bit dull. I enjoy the original Star Trek movies as better. General movie goers should stick to Star Wars which are all amazingly done in blu ray.  If you already own those and are looking for something different, I highly recommend these. They are fun movies, just be weary they are not for everybody. Overall I welcome these movies into my collection, I will watch them again except for the third film which I felt was just terrible.",1346371200,,6726,4.318289786223278

If your one of those people that believe that there is no reason to spend the extra money for Blu-Ray that's fine the Quqdrilogy is the Anthology's equivalent but in DVD format. If you only own a standard DVD player and don't really want to upgrade then go with the Quadrilogy or even if you still want the movies and just want to save a little bit of money then defiantly go with the Quadrilogy. Ether way you can't go wrong with the amount of bonus materials that's on these two sets. It's just all personal preference on if you want the Blu-Ray or the DVD's.,1344211200,3,906,4.530487804878049
1956144,5,B0000VCZK2,"I've often thought of Blu-ray as a ""last gasp"" of the physical media world, having only adopted Blu-ray as a technology in my household over the last year.  With hundreds of DVDs already purchased over the years, the thought of re-purchasing anything I already own seemed ridiculous.  I've since purchased the movies that have most resonated with me over the years (read: geeky movies) on the new format, and while most of them have had some truly great audio and video transfers (Lord of the Rings comes to mind), most of what I've purchased is comprised of ""newer"" movies that haven't needed the love that the first two Alien movies needed in order to be relevant from a quality standpoint.

Alien in particular has a truly stunning video transfer.  While there are a few moments that demonstrate that this is in fact a movie that was filmed 33 years ago, the crispness and detail in virtually every scene makes it feel like someone captured these moments yesterday.  Of particular note is the lens flare, the lighting/shadows throughout the ship, and the scenes with MUTH-R.  You will be forgiven if you think this is a modern movie in those scenes.

Aliens also fairs quite well, although it would be a ""9"" to Alien's ""10"" as far as transfer quality.

The audio is also quite well-preserved, although there are moments in both movies where the actual samples weren't cleaned up and have a strange, almost sound-stage-ish quality to them.  I say strange, of course, but they've always sounded that way; it is merely more evident that they were not re-mastered in the same way, much less re-recorded.  Certainly not a deal-breaker, but worth mentioning.

I mentioned ""a few moments"" where the age of the movie shows, and it unfortunately is in the rather rough special effects in Alien.  I'm sure I'll be burned alive with Internet flames by saying this, but a piece of me wishes for a George-Lucas-level cleaning of those few moments (the Nostromo flying through space, the occasional HUD, and Bilb...er...Ash's ""accident"" to name the worst offenders).  I know that this wouldn't preserve the integrity of this classic film, but these moments have not aged well even without this superb HD re-release; seeing them in startlingly lifelike 1080p only makes them hurt more.  I don't think a CG dance number should be inserted, but these moments would be a world better if digitally retouched (not to mention make them feel a bit more at home against the recently-release-and-breathtakingly-amazing-to-watch Prometheus).

The packaging is also nothing short of professional, and is almost a conversation piece in how well-realized it is.

In summary, if you've loved these movies growing up, or you want to know why the hell the stuff in Prometheus is referenced, you should immediately pick this up.",1344038400,,2799,4.948717948717949

1956149,5,B0000VCZK2,"I want to make one thing clear: There are two items called Alien Anthology. One was released in 2010, and one in 2012. The 2012 release does NOT have all of the cool bonus stuff that you no doubt have read about or have seen pictures of. I HIGHLY suggest you ensure the copy you purchase, if you do decide to purchase AA, is the 2010 release with all 6 discs.

I'd never seen any of these films before I bought this. Really.

I have a friend who is a big movie fan, and every time I see him he'll bring up a film, and 5 minutes later go, ""You've seen that, right?""
The answer is always ""Nope.""

When this happened with Pulp Fiction, the rest of my afternoon was pretty much determined for me. You can insert any significant film in that spot and odds are it'll work.

With the Alien series, I wanted to do something about it before the question could come up. I knew at some point he'd get to Ridley Scott. Blade Runner had already come and gone, but I could still beat him to Alien. I went ahead, and bought the Alien Anthology on a whim. It wasn't expensive by any means, and it had stellar reviews.

I'm really, really glad I bought this.

Alien Anthology spares no expenses in being a quality product. It's design, both aesthetic and functional, are reminiscent of the very thing it's a tribute to. The book uses nice, thick, pages, with one page per film, and a dividing page between the films. The pages dedicated to a film have that films disc inside them, via an initially hard to see slip pouch. Just look closely and you'll find the two spots for your fingers to rest.

The content on disc itself is overwhelming at first. The Anthology includes an instruction manual that I highly suggest reading thoroughly, it will help you get the most out of your experience with each disc. Things like MU-TH-UR mode make repeat viewings more than just ""Oh, I didn't notice that before."" and as much as I loathe the expression, you really need to be there to get it. It's remarkable.

If you looked at this product and had even the slightest tinge of interest, buy it. Don't hesitate, don't second guess it, buy it. You won't regret it. I am so glad I went through with this.",1343174400,,2173,4.348148148148148

1956153,5,B0000VCZK2,I purchased this item during a daily deal.  It was only $20 for the BluRay box set.  Great value!  I would recommend this to anyone if the deal appears again.,1342828800,,158,4.2
1956154,5,B0000VCZK2,"As a fan of the first two ""Alien"" movies, I held off buying this anthology on Blu-Ray because I had bought the various re-releases of these films through the years as home video technology improved and picture quality got better and better. I collected these films on VHS, then Laserdisc, then DVD, from crappy pan & scan versions up to the the latest DVD realeases, which were pretty good. Anyway, I was kind of burnt out on the whole franchise when they announced this Blu-ray release.

Amazon had offered this set at under $30 at least once before, but I still held off. They recently offered it again for $28.95, which was less than it was going for used, and almost the same price as the first two movies purchased individually (note that the individual sale discs have few extra features), so I took the plunge - I'm really glad I did!

All four films are offered in two different versions, and there are more extras here than only the most die-hard fans will ever care to fully look at (each film has its own 2+ hour ""making of"" documentary, plus thousands of productions stills, amongst other goodies).

""Alien"" looks and sounds amazing - If people ask what makes Blu-Ray so much better than standard DVD, this would be the comparison to show them. I always loved the sets for this film, and in hi-def you see every gritty detail that made this movie so convincing. To me, this single film was worth the price alone.

""Aliens"" is almost as good - they used a lot of blue screen in this film, and my earlier copies always made those shots stick out. They blend in much better on Blu-ray, a testimonial to the people who remastered this film. It's probably the best this film will ever look on a home screen.

After seeing these two films it's hard for many to get into the films that followed. ""Alien3"" just didn't click for me, and ""Alien Resurrection"" was at turns just too bizarre and goofy.

If you are a fan of all four films, then this will be worth the going price - you will not be disappointed. If you just like the first two films only, this box set is still worth getting if you want the extras and see it on sale.",1342828800,,2132,4.412213740458015

1956172,5,B0000VCZK2,"This movie is a shining example of what all Blu-ray sets and re-releases should strive for. The video and sound quality on all movies is amazing. Moreover, the amount of remastering does not take away from the atmosphere of the originals and does not look cheesy like some movies that have been redone. Even better, each disc includes both the remastered version AND the original theatrical release, for those of you that want to see them movie as it was originally released!

Also, the set is loaded with special features that are actually worth watching. I'm not a huge fan of special features usually, but we watched them on this disc and were instantly sucked in. The ""making of"" videos really add and extra dimension to the movie and really help reinforce what a special piece of film history this series represents. I thought that knowing how they were made would take away from the wonder and horror of the movies, but instead it just reinforced it! The sets for the movies were practically living as they were seen on the screen.

If you like any of the Alien movies, BUY THIS SET. This is one of those few times when buying a box set on Blu-ray is worth it even if you already own an older DVD boxed set. Most of the time companies just transfer them on to Blu-ray to make a quick buck from fans who can't resist something because of its title. However, this set is an exception. They put a lot of work into this and tried to make it great, and they succeeded. This set is worth every penny. I really cannot give enough praise.

1956177,4,B0000VCZK2,"This is a review of the Blu-ray version of this box set.

I love the ""Alien"" films, even the ugly stepchild ""Alien 3,"" which many viewers didn't seem to have the patience for -- this was David Fincher's first film, and I do blame the studio for making this mess -- Fincher's work ever since this movie suggests he was interfered with rather drastically.

Each film has its own distinct ""feel."" ""Alien"" is the horror movie, ""Aliens"" is the action movie, ""Alien 3"" is the existential movie, and ""Alien Resurrection"" feels a lot like old-timey, retro science fiction to me (and did when it came out).

In short, these films deserve excellent presentation, and for the most part, the Blu-ray version delivers. You get the two-fer treatment for each film -- two versions of each of the movies, mostly labeled theatrical release and director's cut, although in the case of Alien 3 the longer version can't be called that because Fincher has disowned the film. As for Ridley Scott, he has said on more than one occasion that the theatrical cut is his preferred version of ""Alien,"" though this set does include what we'll just call an ""alternate"" version.

My main problem with the Blu-ray edition -- and the reason I cannot give it four stars -- is that the discs take an inordinately long time to load. I thought maybe it was my player, but it happens on both my Sony and Yamaha -- and the Yamaha is pretty sophisticated, although not top of the line.

Still, this is a worthy collection, obviously -- and the chance to see these movies in HD, with high-def sound to boot, is irresistible.",1341187200,2,1583,4.619217081850533

1956198,5,B0000VCZK2,"BIRTHED (THEN ESCAPED) FROM MY AMAZON.CO.UK REVIEWS

Rumour Control, here are the facts: the nine disk ALIEN QUADRILOGY Box Set (pictured above) is an absolute must-own, worth every last penny.

Thanks, Brian, couldn't have put it better myself...

Anyone interested in the sci-fi/horror phenomenon no doubt has their own favourite ALIEN movie. In my case it has to be the first, the one where the H.R. GIGER's acid-for-blood, exo-skeletal chestbursting masterpiece makes its spectacular debut. And yet, whilst fully delivering on what is nowadays referred to as 'genre expectations', Ridley Scott's ALIEN still manages to be the model of restraint, a 'less means more' approach to storytelling and is consequently the best film in the series.

In complete contrast (and necessarily so), James Cameron directs his ALIENS with all the subtlety of a migraine attack. It's a brilliantly staged affair that - once you get over the gung-ho Uncle Sam histrionics - provides a very exciting continuation of the story, throwing into sharp relief the terrifying link between Ripley and the Alien Queen (the dual parallels of surrogate motherhood being a particularly strong and bloody motif throughout). An excellent film, sponsored by Neurofen.

It's only with hindsight that David Fincher's ALIEN 3 can be assessed with a degree of rationality. In 1991 it seemed a disappointing mess in comparison with what had come before but now, thanks to the extras, we can at least understand why the production was so troubled. Yet there were many good elements in that second sequel, some of which clearly fell under the radar of disappointment first time around. A long-overdue revisit to Fiorina Fury 161 therefore may be a pleasant surprise - it certainly was for me. For further information and insight check out THE ALIEN QUARTET by David Thomson, published by Bloomsbury. (see review)

Jean-Pierre Jeunet's ALIEN RESURRECTION is, to my mind, the most controversial of the quad. Part European Art-house, part formulaic actioner, it never quite gels in the way it should. Certainly, it has the overall feel and texture of everything that's gone before but there's a chill vein running through the centre of this film that fails to warm up even as the story heads back to Mother Earth. Good, but it could have been so much better.

The extras for ALIEN QUADRILOGY are by themselves reason enough to purchase. Directors, producers, screenwriters, actors, modelmakers, composers, designers, set-decorators...all talk candidly about every aspect of the four films. Fox deserves huge credit for not stepping on studio-critical opinions and, as a result, there is a genuine sense of good and talented people doing the best they can in often very trying circumstances. It's a very refreshing look behind the scenes and renders the featurettes (of which there are many) totally engrossing.

Picture and sound quality is excellent throughout and the packaging clearly shows that Fox have pride in their product. It's an inspired way to show off each 'Director's Cut' to its best possible advantage and, short of a 3D  reworking, there is no better representative of the ALIEN franchise currently available.

Get a hold of this now, and then let it get a hold of you. You won't be disappointed.

VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED",1340668800,,3297,5.166979362101313

I read some freezing reviews mostly from older ""DVD"" sets but figured blu ray wasn't going to freeze! I'm using my Ps3 though I don't know if this is the problem.. It froze on Aliens on the rescue mission then tried playing it on directers cut and it froze on the same part, it can't be the ps3 right?  I'm really hoping I got a bad set, because the movie/video quality in part one was great, part 2 was ok but not great, overall great set it just sucked that mines froze in the middle of part two and I cant do anything about it!!",1340582400,,639,4.153225806451613

However the set came up as a Gold Box deal and it was too good to pass up. It was a great choice, as the packaging is gorgeous and the additional discs with special features and documentaries are worthwhile for collectors. As for the quality of the movies themselves, they really outdid themselves. The picture quality of all the transfers are superb, even with the close to 40 year old original! They also include both the original and director's cuts for the films. Which are great for completionists. All in this was worth the money with the Gold Box deal.

I have to say that I've never seen Alien or Aliens in such a clear format.  I have an HD Sony XBR set with Verizon Fios... I thought that I had seen Aliens in the best picture but actually i had not until this bluray set.

You can see EVERY LITTLE DETAIL.  Not to mention the attention to detail in the packaging is amazing.  I don't really watch the extra features, but I think I'll get to those this time.

Having the original monster set of The Alien Quadrilogy, and with the advent of Blu-ray well, the Alien Anthology is a must have for any Alien fan. I decided on the import offering mainly due to it being lesser priced than the US release, and was a bit concerned it may not work with my Blu-ray player, but every disc works perfectly. My only issue with the Blu-ray set is that ALIENS(film 2), while in wide screen format, is not Letterbox as the other films and the picture quality does take a bit of a hit. But otherwise, this is THE set to have in your collection. The bonus material and extras are off the hook and you can spend hours and hours exploring the Alien world and how it all came to be.

One comical note is that there are two warnings on the packaging from the Irish Film classification Office. the first states the Blu-ray set is 'Fit for viewing by persons aged are 18 years or more.' The second states, 'Suitable only for persons of 18 years and over. Not to be supplied to any person below that age.'

Least importantly it has nice, high quality packaging with fantastic artwork. It is something that will look great on a movie rack.

Most importantly, this has all the features any Alien fan could want. With all films having theatrical and director's cuts, it is all the film anyone could want. The quality of both theatrical and directors cuts is great as well. There is just a little extra 'pop' with these films on blu-ray.

As for special features, this anthology gets high marks as well. With over 50 hours of special features, there isn't much more one could want from the Alien Universe.

Overall, extremely pleased with this purchase. I have not found one draw back to this anthology yet. Very highly recommend for Alien fans and even people who have never watched the films. Superb collection for a Sci-Fi classic.",1339545600,,921,4.8471337579617835
1956212,3,B0000VCZK2,"When this was on sale, I checked out some of the reviews, and they were so good, I jumped at getting an upgrade from the Quadrilogy.  The first drawback was a notice on the screen basically saying my Samsung Blu-ray player doesn't have enough memory to take advantage of the skip-the-garbage-at-the-beginning feature or the MU-TH-R program.  That's not the disk's fault of course (Samsung has proven to be a MAJOR disappointment to me), but it means I'm not getting everything out of the set that I should.  But it's all about the movies, right?  I can live with the FBI warning.  So I started watching the films.  The transfers are everything the other reviewers say they are, except....  I saved Aliens for last and just got finished watching it--sort of.  Good as it is, the picture kept stuttering and jiggling and the scene index would periodically pop up for no reason at all.  Amazon's going to send me a replacement, but much as I love the franchise, I'm not looking forward to watching all four movies again quite so soon.  I guess I should feel special, since nobody else seems to have had this problem, but this kind of special I don't need.",1339459200,2,1152,4.630541871921182

It's like a really thick paper box that you slide the blu ray in and out.

If you don't know what I mean just go to youtube and check out some unboxing done for this US edition. This edition is so much better than the UK edition and feels so sturdy. Ppl might complain about the cardboard used to hold the blu rays and that it might scratch the discs over time but it should be ok if you are careful - be gentle each time and you should be fine.,1338768000,,538,4.037383177570093

1956225,5,B0000VCZK2,"I'm not going to bore you with the details seeing that just about every other review here has gone into full, unadulterated detail about what this set includes so I'll just go ahead and add my brief two cents by saying that this is a completely justifiable upgrade from the Alien Quadrilogy DVD box set, even if they both contain much of the same material.

The transfers are absolutely beautiful and ""Aliens"" in particular has never looked or sounded better. Plus you get just about every existing cut of the four films available, including the more complete version of ""Alien 3"" which is a must watch for fans of the series.

One of the things this one has over the Quadrilogy box set is MUCH better packaging. The DVD set was one of those fold out packages that was more insult than anything else. I'm the type that likes to get to a disc quickly, not unfold some ugly contraption six times just to get to one disc. The packaging here is more similar to the recent Blu Ray edition of the Star Wars saga, which came neatly packaged in a book-like case that was very convenient and elegantly designed.

Also, some of the behind the scenes docs for Alien 3 were notoriously cut down for the DVD set but it's been reported that they've been restored to their original forms for the Blu Ray set, so that's a pretty big plus. The backstory regarding the making of ""Alien 3"" is probably the most interesting of the four for a number of reasons and the supplements do a really good job with covering all the different aspects of this legendary and troubled production.

The wealth of information that you get in this entire set is mind numbing almost. It's quite a bit of material and if you like these movies enough to want to know a little more about them, then you've come to the right place. The Alien Anthology is an absolutely amazing set brimming with content and just about perfect in every imaginable way.",1338508800,,1909,4.508670520231214

1956230,5,B0000VCZK2,"I own the 'Alien Quadrilogy' and hesitated to upgrade for a long time. I hate nothing like a greedy studio that tosses out another edition of the same movie every two or three years. The 'Quadrilogy' is more than enough for any but the most hardcore Alien fans, and if you don't care about Blu-ray one way or the other, seek out a copy of that. You will be happy.
There is a major visual upgrade, the sound seems 'better', though it was difficult to reach the perfect balance. If I was happy with it in a dialogue scene, as soon as things started blowing up/aliens started screeching/guns started blasting, etc, I'd have to turn it WAY down. I am not enough of an audiophile to pronounce judgement on whether this was my soundbar's fault (it's a nice soundbar,though) or something about the Blu-ray mastering ( I do not recall having the same problem with the Quadrilogy).
There are many extras that were not present on the Quadrilogy, but unless you're super hardcore, not enough new stuff to make it alone worth the buy. It's mostly the same as 'Quadrilogy'.

I was VERY curious to see what the upgrade from DVD resolution to Blu-Ray would do for the films, and here is where your money's worth is over the DVDs. It's a MAJOR AND SERIOUS upgrade. There were actually several instances where I thought it actually was a negative, where some of the 'scare' is lessened because you can see the alien coming three miles away, where before it just pounced suddenly out of the shadows. That's 'tomayto/tomahto' though, because my fiance, who had not seen anything but the original, was plenty creeped out. I may just prefer my aliens lunging out of the dark because that's how I've always seen them.
But other than that one small personal minus, it's seriously cool- you can every little detail on every piece of the ship, where I couldn't before, even on the 'Quadrilogy'. One can see the truly enormous amount of craftsmanship and attention to detail that went into the set, costumes, and of course the aliens. Given that they had no idea their work would ever be put to such a test as 1080p, it's a true testimonial to the quality of their work.

I had a lot of trepidation because quite a few of these reviews mention the set will not work properly on a sizable number of Blu-ray players, and I've had so much trouble with mine already I was reluctant to risk it. (It is a newish player, was top-of-the line last year when I bought it and way more expensive than it needed to be for the amount of grief it's given me). THEN, though, I started noticing reviewers saying that the region-free version does not have these glitches. Amazon US does not officially sell the region-free version, but check out the ""new and used from..."" section and you will eventually find someone offering the region-free version. I have also heard of people just going to Amazon UK and purchasing it.
I've read several reviews noting the Region 1 version is packaged in the 'hardcover book' type cardboard style...the UK version is packed like a tradtitional set, in the familiar 'Blu-ray blue' plastic with plastic 'leaves' inside that each disc snaps in/out of, then the whole thing is slipcased as you see in the product description. I prefer this style.

I got mine from a guy selling his region-free set through Amazon and paid a very reasonable price. I haven't worked through the whole set yet...have not started the bonus features and probably will not for awhile as I'd already watched it all on DVD. So far, though, I've had no problems and the set is AMAZING. It was, all things considered, well worth the upgrade from DVD.",1338249600,10,3612,4.623052959501558

1956232,5,B0000VCZK2,"I had gotten used to viewing these movies (especially the first movie) on standard DVD. Alien looked grainy and just plain terrible. I expected this considering the age of the movie. Alien in this transfer looks visually as though it was filmed recently...the quality of the video transfer to Blu-ray is that good. Whomever handled the transfer to Blu-ray should be applauded for the work. Unlike transfer like Star Wars (4-6) to Blu-ray which is of very poor quality, this is worth the purchase at even the $100 retail price.

Buy the set, it is well worth it at the sub-$50 price I paid!

1956233,5,B0000VCZK2,"Fox delivered the motherlode for Blu-Ray owners, and Alien fans, with their utterly spectacular, six-disc ALIEN ANTHOLOGY box-set. While Fox's 2003 ""Alien Quadrilogy"" DVD release set standards in the format for its wealth of supplemental content as well as its picture and sound quality, those attributes that have been matched, surpassed, and then some by this high-def package, which offers all the goodies from that release, piles on new content, offers never-before-seen footage and wraps it all up with some of the Blu-Ray format's most impressive transfers produced for catalog content.

As Ridley Scott mentions in his liner notes, this long-gestating project was the culmination of two years of hard work by Charlie de Lauzirika and the folks at Scott Free. It's hard to heap enough superlatives on top of this release because from its presentation on down to its massive extra features (the majority of which are exclusive to the box-set), the ""Alien Anthology"" is like opening up the ultimate Christmas present for fans of the series.

The mammoth package includes all four ""Alien"" films in both their theatrical release versions and extended Special Edition edits, with a pair of supplemental discs jammed with content from the 2003 documentaries, the ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" laserdisc box-sets, never-before-seen deleted materials and plenty (and I do mean plenty) more.

Because most of us are more than familiar with the four films, I'm not going to spend a great deal of time critically analyzing the pictures.

Suffice to say, ALIEN rode the sci-fi wave that ""Star Wars"" ignited and became a classic in its own right thanks to Ridley Scott's direction, the film's evocative production design and striking H.R. Giger creature effects. The story may be simple and derivative (and methodically paced), but everything about the execution of ""Alien"" is elegant and eerie. Both the film's theatrical version and the more recent, so-called ""Director's Cut"" are included -- as Ridley Scott states about the latter, it's not really a ""Director's Cut"" but an alternate version with extra footage. It's also a bit faster-paced, as evidenced by the shorter running time, adding a couple of extra glimpses of the alien and the infamous cocoon scene at the end (which thankfully has been trimmed from its unexpurgated outtake state on previous laser/DVD editions). No matter which way you go, ""Alien"" is still a classic of the genre, regardless of the many shameless imitations that followed in the wake of its release.

Its belated 1986 follow-up, ALIENS deservedly ranks as one of the great sequels of all-time, with James Cameron's brilliant reworking of the franchise opening up the story and characterizations of its predecessor. Sigourney Weaver rightly copped an Oscar nomination for her work as Ripley here, and the supporting performances (especially Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton) add depth to a rollercoaster ride of a movie that's bigger and quite different than its predecessor, upping the amount of scares and enhancing the material with plenty of action. Though fans again have their preference between the two versions of the picture, I find the theatrical version to be the superior one, faster-paced and more satisfying than the ""Director's Cut.""

While ""Aliens"" improved in many ways on its predecessor, the ill-fated ALIEN 3 wrote the text-book on how not to make a sequel. This unrelentingly grim and tedious film was a disastrous way for David Fincher to start his career in features, the messy result of a handful of writers and filmmakers having been previously attached to the long-in-development project. What ended up being made was not only an unsatisfying follow-up to ""Aliens,"" but a movie that generates almost no legitimate scares, being dull and derivative of what came before. Fincher chose not to participate in the Special Edition's creation, but a longer preview assembly - adding some 30 minutes of previously excised footage - that debuted in the Quadrilogy release returns here and improves somewhat on the original theatrical version, especially in clarifying who the prisoners actually are (which we all know was a problem in the theatrical cut).

After the calamity of the third movie, one might have assumed that ALIEN RESURRECTION would have been an appreciable improvement on its immediate predecessor. Joss Whedon (""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"") came on-board to write the script for French auteur Jean-Pierre Jeunet, but the end result was a tiresome and gory freak show variant on the earlier movies, with more colorful characters than ""Alien 3"" but less visual style. The theatrical version of the movie is included here along with a new ""alternate"" Special Edition (like Scott, Jeunet states that his original edit is the ""Director's Cut""), which adds an unnecessary epilogue to the picture and minor character extensions.

While I'm obviously not a fan of the third and fourth films in the franchise, the ""Anthology"" BD box-set is nevertheless essential for its supplements and behind-the-scenes chronicle of the series -- a strikingly honest assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of each picture. (If only most DVD/BD supplements were as comprehensive as this.)

Technically, the new AVC-encoded transfers are nothing short of revelations. ""Alien"" looked phenomenal on DVD and appears even more detailed and more satisfying here, yet ""Aliens"" - long a problematic title for standard-definition given its inherent grain and low-light cinematography - is the title that's truly glorious to behold, managing to retain its inherent grain and crispness while looking brilliantly detailed. ""Alien 3""'s garish color scheme is more suited for high-definition as well, and even the visuals of ""Alien Resurrection"" receive a boost from the move to Blu-Ray. DTS Master Audio soundtracks are also outstanding in their sonic rendering of effects, dialogue and music, while purists can select the original stereo mixes for the earlier films in the series as well.

Each ""main"" movie disc offers commentaries, isolated score tracks and deleted scenes, the latter of which have been remastered for HD and look nearly as good as the movies themselves. There's also a ""Mu-Th-Ur Mode"" on each movie wherein on-screen prompts tell you what's happening on the various audio tracks (i.e. what the commentary is discussing; what cue is playing on the isolated score mix, etc.), as well as on-screen trivia and information on what ""Enhancement Pod"" materials (more on that in a moment) are available on supplemental discs 5 and 6 pertaining to what you're watching. You can then make a bookmark (""data tag"") so that this material instantly pops up when you insert the special features discs - yet while this feature is meant to make navigating the vast amount of extras more manageable, truth be told I found it's almost like reading a road map because there's just so much here!

The vast majority of the extra features are housed on Discs 5 and 6 (presented in 480p) - from the comprehensive 2003 documentaries to separate archival sections for each film, offering more deleted materials, laserdisc archives for ""Alien"" and ""Aliens,"" vintage promo segments, previously released featurettes, trailers and more. Thus, even if fans would prefer to wait for a standalone release of, say, ""Alien"" or ""Aliens,"" they'll likely be missing out on most of the great extras housed exclusively in the Anthology box-set.

From a sheer musical standpoint, the ""Anthology"" BD adds even more content (namely, isolated score tracks for every film) on top of an already-abundant collection of riches.

In terms of commentary, we learn that Jerry Goldsmith never recovered from having his opening and closing credit themes removed from ""Alien."" James Horner says he was nearly fired by the producers of ""Aliens"" because he couldn't compose the score's climactic cue in the short time frame they desired. And Elliot Goldenthal says the sound mix of ""Alien 3"" was a muddled mess, in a flawed movie he stills calls ""incomplete.""

The candid comments of Goldsmith are just one of the highlights of the ""Alien"" extras, which include the 1999 ""Alien Legacy"" retrospective plus the three-hour 2003 documentary, produced for the Quadrilogy release, on Disc 5. This is a smart, expertly-crafted Making Of that treads over ground other laser and DVD supplements first charted, but does so even more comprehensively. All the major players are interviewed, from Sigourney Weaver to Ridley Scott, David Giler and writers Dan O'Bannon and Ronald Shusett among others.

As you'd anticipate, every facet of the movie is covered - including the score. Goldsmith notes his disappointment at the removal of his music for the end credits, how the ""alternate"" main credit theme he composed in a matter of minutes was used instead of his original (preferred) piece, and how Scott failed to communicate with him about the direction of the score. Also interesting are editor Terry Rawlings' comments about using Howard Hanson (it was better than Goldsmith's work, which ""wasn't his best"" in Rawlings' mind), and David Giler's bizarre description of Goldsmith's music being too overbearing, ""like 'Patton'"" (umm - ok, Mr. Giler!).

A multi-angle view of the chestbuster scene, storyboards, stills, two different edits of Mark Kermode's ""Alien Evolution"" doc, an archival promo featurette, Sigourney Weaver's screen tests, and more deleted scenes are included in the supplements on Disc 6 - and the ""Anthology"" makes amends for the Quadrilogy's lack of isolated scores by including not just one but two different isolated score tracks, one featuring Goldsmith's intended, original score (with pop-up cue information) as well as another for the final soundtrack.

The supplements on ""Aliens"" are likewise comprehensive, starting with the addition of two new isolated score tracks - one for the soundtrack as featured in the film (where Horner's score was heavily reworked), and another offering Horner's intended compositions as best they can be presented. In the 2003 Making Of, Horner recounts his trouble writing for a movie that was still being re-cut and re-filmed once the recording sessions began. Despite the troubles, the composer seems to be diplomatic about the countless alterations Cameron made to his score in post-production, but dives into full frustration about how Gale Anne Hurd threatened to fire Horner from the movie when he needed more time to write the movie's (classic) climactic cue. Horner claims that he told them to go ahead and try and find a ""more experienced"" composer than he - a fiery exchange that proves more honest than anything you'll typically find in a DVD supplement, and the 180-minute Making Of is again filled with great production anecdotes and a thorough history of the production.

The Anthology's supplemental disc 6 houses all the additional ""Aliens"" behind-the-scenes materials you'd expect, along with the long-coveted deleted scene where Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) meets his fate - a moment previously seen only in still photos, and shown here for the very first time. There's even all the footage from the ""Aliens"" mid `90s motion simulator amusement park ride (which I remember going on at the now-defunct Spooky World in Berlin, Mass. when I was at Boston College).

""Alien 3"" may have the tastiest supplement of all, and even better, de Lauzirika's original 2003 documentary - now re-christened under its intended title ""Wreckage and Rage: Making Alien 3"" - is presented here uncut for the first time. Some of it was reportedly discarded because it was ""too honest"" for DVD, but even with the edits, it was a gripping account of a movie that never should have began shooting in the first place. Now, restored to its original tell-all form, it's a spellbinding piece that's far more compelling for me than the movie that ended up on-screen.

Renny Harlin and Vincent Ward are on-hand to discuss their earlier versions of the third movie's premise, which sounded far more intriguing in Harlin's version (which was supposed to have been set on the alien's home planet) and Ward's illogical but visually audacious conception (Ripley crash-lands on a wooden planet run by monks!). Both discuss their departure from the movie and how director Fincher had to deal with a script worked on by ""too many cooks"" that was being constantly rewritten during shooting.

The program is rich with honest comments from the cast and crew, including cinematographer Alex Thomson and composer Elliot Goldenthal. Thomson notes that not even he could tell the difference between some of the characters at a pre-release screening, while Goldenthal engages in a fascinating dissection of the movie's unappealing sound mix. The composer's comments are refreshingly direct and pinpoint the movie's weaknesses, though it's equally interesting to hear the sound effects editors say that Goldenthal's music was too loud and overbearing - and how the filmmakers initially considered using no music at all!

Whether or not you like ""Alien 3,"" there's no doubt this documentary is a must for all movie buffs, both for pointing out the failings of the finished movie and the more interesting directions that original versions of the story might have produced.

""Alien Resurrection""'s special features include one more mammoth documentary - running a few minutes under three hours - featuring interviews with the principal filmmakers (including Jeunet) and a substantial look at the disappointing score by John Frizzell, which is easily the weakest of the series.

There are also four additional ""Enhancement Pods"" contained on the fifth disc, created exclusively for the Blu-Ray, which feature additional outtakes from de Lauzirika's 2003 documentaries (from Renny Harlin's decision to quit ""Alien 3"" and more of Fincher's turmoil shooting the sequel), raw outtakes, dialies and more. Among the gems are Goldsmith talking about how he found the ""Alien"" characters ""disgusting"" and originally was rooting for the monster!

All the discs are housed in a gorgeous, functional, small hardbound book with a guide to the disc contents and liner notes from Scott, who notes that the Anthology Blu-Ray serves a primer for PROMETHEUS, his own, upcoming return to the series ""filled with Aliens, Space Jockeys and...something even more dangerous you haven't seen yet."" After watching this outstanding box-set, it's hard to imagine viewers won't be excited by returning to that universe all over again.",1337472000,14,14499,5.244607420189819

1956244,5,B0000VCZK2,"This release of the 'Alien' movies is still the best option to get for any fan of the franchise.  Save for maybe the BLU-RAY release.  I personally am still on DVD, so that's what I'm reviewing.  I imagine both sets are practically identical content-wise.

This set  was released some years ago, and was at the time AND still is the definitive way to own these movies.  With this box-set you get 'Alien', 'Aliens', 'Alien 3', and 'Alien Resurrection'.  'Alien' & 'Aliens' are epic.  'Alien 3' is good.  'Alien Resurrection' lacked, but as a fan you still need to own it.

Action wise 'Aliens' is your best option.  Space marines going in with huge guns to kill the Xenomorphs, how can you go wrong.  At the end when Ripley walks in with that 'Mech Warrior' looking suit on and attacks the Queen Alien, you feel like starting a church in honor of James Cameron.  Bear in mind he had no CG to use also, and still made this stellar movie.  Oh, thank Ridley Scott while your at it.

But the big selling point with this set is not just the movies, but the fact you get director cuts AND more special features than you could burn through on a hooky day from work.  It probably would take you a weekend to go through them all.

The case itself is gorgious, (I word I don't use too often), and quite sturdy.  I personally like this design.  It holds the discs very securely.  So if it's thrown into your bag or whatever, the discs should not come loose.

I have been the proud owner of this set for years now.  One of the best collections of movies I own.

Now that 'Promethius' is coming out, get this release and re-amerse yourself before seeing the highly anticipated prequel this summer.

1956247,5,B0000VCZK2,"The value of this collection depends largely on whether you are the kind of person who thinks that seeing behind the scenes of a movie adds a layer of appreciation, rather than detracts from enjoyment.  While I am no fan of director's cuts or deleted scenes, camera test footage is an entirely different matter.  Although there isn't a lot of it here, what there is, is primo.  Example: footage of a dog in an alien costume (I kid you not, see the extra's for Alien 3). Another example: footage of the queen when she was little more than foam blocks and trash bags.

Although there is a ton of talking head footage, together they compare and contrast with each other, Rashomon-like.  Many of the people connected with the film are speaking candidly: the interviews for Alien 3 clearly acknowledge that they are telling a story of how not to make a movie.

Then there are the oft-told tales which you may think you know but are told in more depth by more people: the first chestburster scene in Alien is a prime example.  The legend that the actors didn't know it was going to happen at all is pure fiction, but the real details are even better.  There are also actor interviews which emphasize how rigorous production can be, and by this I mean more than 12 hours days and unheated sound stages.  Apparently these films depended on a lot of fresh meat byproducts, which smelled bad upon delivery and only got worse with time.  And not only was the underwater sequence in Resurrection both taxing and potentially dangerous: Winona Ryder has some very interesting things to say about the condition of the water in the pool, dug on the Fox lot specifically for the film.  Cast and crew spent a month in that water, which wasn't changed, ever.

Also fascinating is the fact that the special effects in Alien were highly dependent on existing low-tech of the day, while the fourth had over a hundred CG effects.  Frankly, I didn't understand everything the effects people were saying, but no matter: there are miniatures and puppets galore, all lovingly crafted and with more details than you'd ever pick up upon first viewing of the films themselves.  All the directors save Fincher are interviewed at length on how and why they made the artistic choices they did.

As other reviewers have noted, the packaging of the nine discs gets to be like unfolding a gas station map, and by the time you get to disc nine there is little you haven't already heard in the previous four extras discs, each of which contains multiple navigation screens to move between pre-production, production and post-production. It takes a little getting used to, but once you do you have a number of options as to what and how to view the documentary and archival items.",1334793600,,2741,4.669438669438669
1956248,2,B0000VCZK2,"The second, longer cut of Aliens is certainly major evidence for anyone wanting to make case that James Cameron is the worst blockbuster filmmaker ever.  Cameron introduces the two versions saying that he performs his much longer 247 minutes, noting that it takes 40 minutes to actually get to the colony where the aliens have destroyed the colonists.  The 40 minutes add nothing of substance; shots are needlessly prolonged; deleted scenes--deleted because they should have been--now make the film bloated.  I turned it off at 45 minutes. I could not take this stunning example of bad filmmaking any longer.  Alien holds up well--the newer version is almost exactly the same. Ridley Scott knows how to make a film.  Alien 3 loos better on blu-ray, but the third act goes completely out of control.  Don't know what David Fincher was thinking.  The film is very watchable.  Alien: Resurrection is basically like a Resident Evil film--it's all action, no characters and totally boring.  Some French guy I've never heard of directs.  His ""improved"" version, not a director's cut, he says, is actually worse than the theatrical release version.  Watching two of these films again and not watching all of the other two just made me want to see Blade Runner again.",1334707200,2,1259,4.976076555023924
1956249,5,B0000VCZK2,"First of all, this set includes all four (thus far) Alien films: ""Alien"", ""Aliens"", ""Alien3"", and ""Alien: Resurrection"".  This set also includes a huge amount of special features; special features such as ""The Making of..."", photo galleries, and behind-the-scenes tight of (for lack of a better word) stuff.  The extras come in two Blu-Ray discs (unlike other collections where the movies come in Blu-Ray discs and extras in DVDs).
Each movie disc comes with both the Director's Cut version of the film and the Theatrical version.  They also include commentaries in each.  All of the other extras, as I said above, come in two separate Blu-Ray discs.
This collection brings all the extras and special features from the past collectors editions of the films and puts them all together into one collection.  It also has its own exclusive extras not seen in past editions.  The reason why I buy films in collection, besides the awesome packaging, is because of the special features, so if anyone else loves special features then this is a perfect collection to have.  If you doubt the amount of features it has, just look at the ""Special Features"" section of the film's page.

I bought this collection for about $43, so at that price it was a steal.  Each film alone costs $15 and would have cost me $60 (plus tax) for all.  Also, each seperate film lacks any features beyond those which the movie discs in this collection have.  So for about $20 dollars less I got all four films, plus two more discs filled with extras (that the separate versions lack), and I got it all in a elegant and convenient package.

I am reviewing the UK version of this set.

The video quality is great in all four of the Alien movies in this set.  It is not perfect, but it is close to it.  In one of the movies (I don't remember which), there was some grain and distortion in the black portion of a dark scene.  Mostly, there is no grain or distortion.  I think the second movie had some fine grain sometimes.  Overall, I give the video quality a 9.5 on a 10.0 scale.

Aspect ratio is about 2.35:1, except the second movie (Aliens) is 1.85:1.

Sound is DTS-HD 5.1 Master Audio, which is great.  I don't remember great surround sound and sub-woofer bass in the first movie (there might have been), but I did notice it in the last three movies (I remember saying ""WOW!"" in the last three).

This is the first time I have seen these movies.  I am very glad I bought this Blu-Ray set, because the movies are really good, and the audio/video quality is great.  I was disappointed in the ending of the last movie, because I thought it left things hanging.",1333152000,,1132,4.354066985645933
1956255,5,B0000VCZK2,"I purchased the Alien Anthology import version (UK) which is about $30.00 less than the US version. This is the only difference between the two versions...the price. Everything else is EXACTLY the same. UK blu-ray version is region free so it will run perfectly on any US blu ray player provided that you update the firmware of your player, and that it has a memory storage. I have a dedicated blu ray player (not a PS3) with a USB slot. When I first launched Alien Anthology, it asked for a 1MB storage. I used my flash drive and inserted it in the USB...voila! The 1MB storage requirement is for the special features built into the movies... I think.

So far, I've watched Alien 2, 3 ,4 in this box set. The Anthology has two versions of the movie on each disc- Original Release and 2003 Release. I watched the 2003 release for 2,3,4. I was not disappointed. I have all four DVD versions that I bought many years ago and you can see the huge difference on blu ray. Alien 2 still has a few grainy scenes but not as bad as the DVD version. You can now see details of the Colonial Marine uniforms, the pulse rifle, the Queen Alien, all in spectacular detail. Alien 2 sound has been revamped as well. It's louder, earth shaking rumble.

Alien 3 so far has the best quality remastering than 2 and 4. Also, the 2003 version of Alien 3 added TONS of additional scenes, and removed a few. Everything looked so crystal clear and crisp. Sound was overhauled completely.

Alien 4 also looked spectacular. The story was ok. All the technology and remastering couldn't save the movie from Winona Ryder's acting so you'll just have to contend with her. Haha! Still, it's a good Aliens movie.

I have not seen Alien 1 in this box set. I am reserving this for this weekend. Also I have not tried the special features called MU-TH-UR mode. I'm still not clear as to how this works. Right now, I am just enjoying the movies without playing around with the special features.

Overall, this is probably one of the best anthology packages ever assembled. 20th Century Fox really did their job well here. TONS of commentaries, behind the scenes footages, everything a fan wants to know about Aliens.  I highly recommend this box set. It's a major revamp of the entire Aliens anthology.

I don't need to review the films themselves because if you're a fan, you already know the details. One thing I do recommend is to buy the set here on Amazon that has ""[blu ray import]"" in the title. The set is almost identical, yet instead of the cardboard case with sleeves you get in the US set (which is very prone to scratching both the sleeves and the discs) you get a hard plastic blu ray case that holds all 6 discs (the 4 films+2 bonus discs) and it does a much better job at holding the set together. Not to mention rather than a $45-75 price tag that the US version holds, I got a sealed import for 30 bucks.  I have tested the import set on both the PS3 and my blu ray player, and the discs work perfectly, as the blu rays are region free from this set. Having double dipped on this series (more like triple) I can say this is the best set I've had, and I recently sold my US edition single disc blu rays of Alien and Aliens to splurge and get this, since the single disc releases are the same discs you get in the set, I've checked. If you've ever purchased the single disc US blu ray releases you get the 2 versions of the film, but lack much of the MU-TH-UR features, deleted material, behind the scenes, etc that are found on disc 5 and 6.

In the British version you get the same amount of discs, but in a plastic box that is encased in a cardboard sleeve. The quality is amazing. A reviewer previously stated that he was very unhappy with the remastering of these films, but I have to disagree. All 4 movies look spectacular. Alien has NEVER looked this good. All 4 films come with both the theatrical and alternate version. Also included are two discs that are full of extra features. For those of you who are worried about regional blocking, don't worry. I've seen all 4 films already and there hasn't been any problems whatsoever.

1956265,5,B0000VCZK2,"Ok first i want to start by saying that this is the region free version of the Alien Anthology on blu ray, this is also the U.K. release and is absolutely identical to the U.S. version. they both came from the same transfer both audio/video and special features are the same. the only difference between the two versions is that the U.S. version comes in a book form like Star Wars Saga did the. the U.K. version comes in the standard clear blue plastic case. and the U.K. version is Region free.

So YES it will play in American blu ray players and PS3's. No problems at all with playback in my ps3. so now for my review of the tranfser to blu ray and the movie ratings.

I was a little worried that the moives might not transfer so well or should i say look good because alien and aliens are old movies. being 1979 for alien and 1986 for aliens. but my fears were unfounded. all of the transfers turned out great better then what i expected for the first 2 movies. i could see no flawless, damage, pictures noise or any other issues with the 1080p transfer. After all they came from a 4K Master so they look outstanding. The blacks are black even inky. motion was smooth and the colors were accurate and natural. im very happy with the overall Video quality. The sound of course is almost perfect. The DTS-HD Master audio 5.1 track was superb. i couldn't hear anything wrong with it.

1956266,5,B0000VCZK2,Item arrived very fast. Was exactly as advertised.  It is a region free set as the description stated.  I tried all disks in my US PS3 first.  They all work excellent.  The only thing I noticed was the initial load took a long time.  It must have something to do with the region coding.  But they work well once they come up.  I then tried them all on my LG stand alone bluray player in the living room. Same result.  I love this series and for the price it is a steal.,1329264000,,469,4.021739130434782
1956267,5,B0000VCZK2,"I was hesitant buying an IMPORT Blu-ray, not knowing what to expect.  I'm sure others are in the same boat looking at this item and the reviews.
The one review that said the transfer was no good, well from my perspective, that just isn't true.  The film looked really good.  I've seen the Aliens move on all sorts of media, VHS, DVD, etc.  This is the first time on Blu-ray.  The movie looked really good to me.  Very clear, high def, etc.  Colors looked great. I'm just a regular person, who's seen Aliens about a million times, and watching it from this Blu-ray, it really looked nice.  Better than anything I've seen thus far. I had no issues with the playback, other than the long load times I get with every blu-ray I try to use on my Samsung player.

The packaging with this set is really compact.  I guess the USA version is larger, but this one is very small, which is nice.  The disks are in a plastic foldout case, unlike the USA version which looks like a foldout book.  This set is about the size of a small paperback, really small and nice.

So, don't go by the review that said the transfer wasn't any good, or the comment about noise.  The films looked great on my hardware, and I experienced nothing like that, at least not for Alien or Aliens.  I've not watched the other 2 yet.",1328745600,3,1295,4.3153526970954355
1956268,5,B0000VCZK2,"This is a great box set containing the two Alien films, and then two strange films that seem to take place in another universe. Alien and Aliens need no introduction. One is a classic horror film relying on atmosphere over cheap jump scares. The other is a classic action film that manages to retain the dread of its predecessor. The third film destroys any hope of this franchise being taken seriously, and the fourth is a better smelling turd than the third. The box set contains 9 discs and will meet your Alien needs. It's simple. Buy this and enjoy two classic films, and learn how not to make films by watching the final two.",1328227200,3,631,4.495652173913044

Every format gets better and better and I have to say that this is the best these movies are going to look for quite a while. The movies are predominately dark anyway but I can see a big difference from the Alien Quadrilogy set. There is alot more detail to every scene and overall it looks tack sharp. If you are thinking about buying it and worrying whether it is worth a double dip - I would say yes indeed it is worth the double dip. These movies look great and the audio sounds very good as you can hear everything. I have not had any problem with these in my machine and they look great.

Needless to say when I saw that people liked the video quality of this release I jumped on the great bargain. I'll be honest I'm just not that impressed with it. I usually sit kinda close to my TV because I have a small apartment so I can really notice the missing pixels in the transfer. The video quality is very grainy. If I sit back far enough though it's not as bad. Oddly enough the quality was actually better in Alien than in Aliens. I know it's not just my system setup either as most of the movies I have look absolutely beautiful. Avatar for example made me nearly wet myself when I saw how rich the video quality was. Is it enough to make me regret my purchase though? Probably not. But I still expected much better.",1327708800,4,894,4.233918128654971

1956280,5,B0000VCZK2,"Although an extreme cinephile, I made a pact with myself when I first bough a Blu Ray player that I would not spend any money trying to replace my old DVDs with new Blu Ray releases of the same films. Over the last year and a half, I have acquired many Blu Rays but stayed faithful to my oath... until now.

 I've been an Alien fan for a long time. I bought the Alien Quadrilogy (the old DVD box set of these movies) the day it came out on DVD. But when I saw this set on sale for only $50, I had to jump on board. And though I broke my promise, it was well worth it.

This is quite simply the finest Blu Ray I own. The casing is exquisite, the films look light years better than their DVD counterparts (which already had an outstanding transfer), and the supplements are some of the most comprehensive work ever done on Blu Ray. All of the old supplements from the DVD release are here plus hours of new footage.

The extras on these disks are so abundant, I will be watching them for weeks to come.

Besides having the first two amazing films and the other ones nobody really cares about; you get an insane amount of behind the scenes material to watch.

Alien-
Movie-5.0/video-5.0/sound-5.0
I won't waste my time reviewing the movie itself - it is awesome. This is the original Ridley Scott masterpiece that started it all.

The film and sound quality are amazing. This is truly one of the greatest transfers of such an old movie; it definitely ranks up there with 2001: a space Odyssey (another Bluray favorite of mine).

Aliens-
Movie-4.5/video-4.5/sound-5.0
Aliens is James Cameron's marine filled take on the Alien tale; and it is awesome. It features one of the most epically badass final acts you will ever see in a sci-fi action film. Blah blah, it is awesome.

The video quality, while not as impressive as Alien, still looks very sharp. The video and sound will please.

The other movies I don't really feel the need to talk about.

ALien 3/Movie-3.5/video-4.0/sound-4.5

ALien Resurrection/Movie-3.0/video-4.0/sound/4.5

The special features are absolutely amazing, even the material for Alien 3 and Resurrection are worth a watch.

1956304,5,B0000VCZK2,"I'm not going to go over the details of the contents of Alien Anthology Blu-Ray Box Set because others here have done that for me and everyone else perfectly. It's the ultimate collection of Alien movies and extras you will ever see in your lifetime, even more so that the original DVD Quadrilogy set and is the new benchmark.

What I wanted to point out about this UK version of Alien Anthology is the differences in packaging. The contents are exactly the same, no differences at all but the UK version has all 6 discs inside a sturdy, protective, blu-ray amaray case so you know your discs will not get scratched. The amaray case has a slip cover box to hold everything with the same beautiful, hologram-like, rainbow artwork as the American version. Sadly, the American version has the discs jammed into cardboard pages that you know in time will scratch the discs so that is why I went with the UK version. Also, the UK version is much cheaper and ships just as fast.

If you are planning to get this box set, don't be afraid to order the UK version, you will not be disappointed. It's REGION FREE which means it will work in your American blu-ray player. I tested all the discs upon arrival in my LG blu-ray player and there was absolutely no problems whatsoever.

When I received this set I popped the first disc in right away and it played right away. Also it was gorgeous. This is a stellar product and at the reduced amazon price it is a must own for everyone.  Even if you have the most recent DVD releases this release blows almost any other release of any other franchise, DVD and Blu-ray alike, out of the water and into space. MU-Th-UR mode is incredible and this set comes packed with tons of other extras and new commentary by the directors for all four films (with the exception of Fincher for Alien 3.)

For me, all discs in this region-free set functioned perfectly on a Panasonic DMP-BD65 player that has never had a firmware update.

Secondly, all four films look truly amazing, and the alternate versions are interesting though not necessarily superior to the theatrical release versions.

Best of all are the staggeringly abundant extras, particularly the extended feature-length documentary films about each movie, which are intelligent and thought-provoking. Instead of using voice-over narration, these films intersperse on-set footage with extensive contemporary interview footage. You get to hear from the writers, producers, directors, cinematographers, actors, composers, visual designers, FX specialists, and so on--pretty much everyone of note except sound designers. David Fincher is conspicuous by his absence from the later interviews; he's only seen in some on-set footage.",1322438400,3,1123,5.678571428571429

They appeared to be identical, except this set has small markings on the front of the box (both say ""18"", which is ""Fit for viewing by persons aged 18 years or more"" according to the back of the box) which apparently is from the Irish Film Classification Office.  This set, I believe, is some kind of import.  With that being said, I have not had any problems with play back. I can't compare the exact content, as I only own this set.  But, this set gives you a TON!!!!!  You get all four movies on four discs (Alien, Aliens, Alien 3, and Alien Resurrection) and two discs of special features.  The cover sticker claimed 60 hours of additional content.  Here's some info from the back of the box:

Alien:  Original Version (116 minutes)
Alien:  Director's Cut (110 minutes)
Letterbox Version 16:9 (Presented in 2.35:1 Aspect Ratio)

Aliens:  Original Version (131 minutes)
Aliens:  Special Edition (148 minutes)
Widescreen Version 16:9 (Presented in 1.85:1 Aspect Ratio)

Alien3:  Original Version (109 minutes)
Alien3:  Special Edition (138 minutes)

Alien Resurrection:  Original Version (104 minutes)
Alien Resurrection:  Special Edition (111 minutes)
Widescreen Version 16:9 (Presented in 2.35:1 Aspect Ratio)

The first thing I did was try each disc in my player and every single one of them loaded without a hitch.  I'm not sure if I'm able to quote prices in my review, but I will say that this set was over 50% cheaper than the other region 1 U.S. version.  If you are having any doubts, read the reviews on this product.  I am reviewing ASIN: B003AQBYUG, and not ASIN: B001AQO3QA.  I recently purchased my blu-ray player from Amazon, a Panasonic DMP-BDT310.  It was manufactured in Sept 2011 so I can confirm that this newer player definitely reads the discs.  This set is not specifically for region 1/U.S., but rather all regions.  The back of the box says A/B/C.  If you use Amazon's help to learn more about regions, you'll see that A, B and C pretty much covers everywhere.  If you're looking to add this set to your collection, I highly recommend it.  As the title of my review says, it was an absolute steal!  Order with confidence and enjoy :)",1321660800,199,2309,4.828644501278772

The other version is ASIN: B001AQO3QA, so I can make no anticipations as to whether or not these are, for what ever reason, the same items. Box sleeves appear to be identical. >>>

Right off the bat, Amazon has this much more inexpensive that it deserves. I'm not gonna play the Price is Right, but it is significant. I will however say I am glad I help out on getting these movies on BD instead of buying the hit-or-missed collections that have swamped the markets. Now, I think we can all say that everyone knows most everything everything about these films, at least the basics behind them.

Long story short...

The main protagonist in the film, Ripley is a genre staple. She goes from being a very skilled officer on a very expensive team to an expert exterminator of this highly aggressive Alien species. This all begins with a mission to land on a waste of a rock to investigate ""something"". The team is caught by one Alien, and Ripley is the only survivor. She gets picked up while adrift in space and gets reamed by the government and ends up line line to work a flight deck. Later, she gets called in to escort a group of Marines thinking it 'might' be one of the Aliens. The Marines land and get sliced apart, Ripley finds a survivor, and there are very few survivors including one bad @$$ Ripley (who has apparently turned into an unbelievable merger of She-Ra/Jack Bauer/Sydney Bristo/Wonder Woman). She and the others crash land on a prison planet and one Alien rips apart the personnel and Ripley saves the day again. The final film is, for the most part, ignored by the fans of the movie series. There. Up to speed in one paragraph.

>>>End Spoilers>>>

The best, non-spoiler description I can manage is this: The first Alien was a thriller; Aliens is a hard-core action flick; Alien 3 is a drama, and Alien Resurrection should have been an abortion. YMMV.

Throughout the intervening years, the name Ripley, has become the epitome of strong and capable sci-fi hero. Every film is amazing, even if it only in the deleted scenes. Since 1979, we've watched and cheered for her. All four films come in two versions - the original or the final director's cut. Both are enhanced amazingly with the digital restorations; one of the best scenes in my opinion is in the fourth film when we see the aliens swimming underwater.

Now, we have some great special features for our viewing pleasure. As if the Director's cuts were not enough. We have isolated music scores for the theatrical versions. Audio commentary is included with several tracks. But there is a ""MU.TH.ER"" mode which throughout each film can change settings such as audio and visual during the film without the need to restart the film or go back for a few minutes teetering around the menus. Another feature is the trivia track, perfect for first time viewers. There is also a lumbering giant of ""Never Before Seen"" footage that cannot be found on any other collection of the DVDs or BDs. On top of that, we have two extra discs that have been collected over the years so that we - our inner film geeks - have it all collected right here.

All films are given the standard 5.1/DTS tracks. I think this series needed the 7.1 treatment, seriously. There's a great handful of subtitles, which as some of the readers here should be used to my strong reactions to the small things like subtitles, good sound tracks and the like.

To sum things up, if you are a fan you should already have this in your collections. If you've been waiting, pick it up, but be careful: Amazon has two sets for BD and the other doesn't have near the added material. Plus, it's more pricey. This is the one you want: B003AQBYUG (which has a total of 552 hours of bonus everything).

This is one of those film sets that everyone in marketing should watch and emulate. These films are classics. And in my eyes, they have finally gotten the quality release they've deserved.",1321056000,6,4083,4.566939890710382

1956320,4,B0000VCZK2,"Who knew?..... The 2003 Quadrilogy set stretched the capacity of DVD to the limit, and had so many extras, it seemed about as definitive and complete as you were ever going to get. Nevertheless, the Blu-Ray set manages to find even More material from the Alien movies to compile in one set.

The picture is as good as it needs to be: not so slick and glossy that it's a gross betrayal of the early films' look, but not shabby, either. Sound is fine, too.
The cardboard booklet packaging is a bit worrying, though -- yes, certain movie series are special classics, but note to all studios: if you want to show true respect for the classics and the fans, put it in decent, sturdy, practical, risk-free packaging.

Should you get this? A) If you have a new, decent Blu-Ray player that can take whatever commands you can throw at it, B) If your Quadrilogy set is getting a mite scratchy and/or worn out, or you don't have it, C) If you at least like these films and want a showcase set with forty-twelve hours of extras, then go for it.

Essentially ALL of the old quadrilogy extras are carted over, and the previously truncated documentary stuff on Alien 3 has been (at least mostly) restored. The detailed, multi-chapter doc.s on each film cover disc five. All four movies come with isolated score tracks (nice!); various documentaries, including the nicely done (if somewhat talky) ""Alien Legacy"" and the cheesily / lazily edited ""Alien Saga"" are here, too. Disc six has the Archives: scripts, storyboards, galleries, trailers & spots, laserdisc archives, ""Alien Legacy"", ""Alien Saga,"" the Bob Burns doc, only two short parodies, a cheesy vintage promo for ""ALIEN"", silly theme park ride stuff, and two versions of ""Alien: Evolution."" Version 1 covers the series of four films; the later version is 99% about the first movie -- I'd suggest watching the second one first, then you can fast-forward the first twenty minutes of the first one without missing much. And with all the promos, trailers, and TV spots, you can learn a whole lot about strategies in (and the art of) advertising, especially the shifty and confused changes over the many promos for the third movie.

A lot of Disc 5 is carry-over from the 2003 DVDs, but it's still very good and detailed behind/scenes stuff. And the bits of missing material concerning ""Alien3"" is put back in here. AND there are lots and lots of ""enhancement pods"" (a few minutes each) with even More information, some fascinating, some flat.
But if ""sheer volume"" and ""bang for the buck"" are the phrases to go by concerning this set, then it's very likely to be a good purchase.

Second note: I've reviewed the films themselves under their individual Blu-Ray titles......except for the two AvP movies, both of which are (thankfully) not in this set, and are utterly awful.",1319414400,,2812,4.765913757700205

I gave it three stars so people can see there might be an issue. It's not just5 the Samsung player it's most players that have an issue if they are a year or more old, some even brand new ones.

1956323,5,B0000VCZK2,"One of the finest releases I have ever had the pleasure to own even more so now adding it to my Blu-Ray collection.

The movies themselves are timeless and presented in their original glory plus FOX was kind  enough to release both Theatrical and Director's cut of the films.

For all you special features fans out there this set does not disappoint, over 20 plus hours of special features including documentaries, production notes, behind the scenes and feature commentaries and that doesn't include the enhancement pods that have to be seen to be believed.

Navigation is a breeze and exploring the history of these films is nothing short of astonishing, forget Star Wars, this series alone is the ultimate in Sci Fi!

If I were to rate the films individually it would go like this:

ALIEN: 10 out of 10.

ALIENS: 10 out of 10.

Alien 3: 8 out of 10, 9.3 out of 10 for the workprint.

Alien Resurrection: 7.8 out of 10.

I am very pleased with this set and hope to watch them all until the discs run down into tiny nubs of what they once were (especially since Blu Ray discs last much longer than regular DVD discs I can look forward to watching this series again and again for many years to come.

The quality of the transfer is excellent. My favorite film is the original Alien, and it looks fantastic on this blu-ray. Due to the original film quality there are some grainy shots but the digital transfer stays true to the film and there is no noticeable edge enhancement or smoothing. The colors and lighting are deep and true and lively, and the overall effect is emotionally moving in subconscious ways that the limited palate of DVD can't equal.

I was paying close attention to the level of detail on the Nostromo and alien spaceship, it's a reference quality blu-ray disk and a fine addition to any library. The world that Ridley Scott and his genius collaborators have fleshed out in this movie is so well defined. You feel the claustrophobic environments of the air ducts and maintenance tunnels of the ship, the hissing coolant and heating gases ... An amazing accomplishment and even though I've seen the movie four times by now, I was still on the edge of my seat in the final 30 minutes of the film!

1956345,5,B0000VCZK2,"This is a must have collection for any Alien fan.  This 9 disk collection contains all 4 Alien films as well as a mountain of extras for each movie.

Disk 1 contains the classic movie... Alien as well as the Director's Cut (I prefer the Director's cut)
Disk 2 contains bonus content for Alien and is a great follow up to watch after the movie

Disk 3 contains Aliens (Alien 2) as well as the Director's Cut (I prefer the Director's Cut here as well)
Disk 4 contains bonus content for Aliens and like the first movie, it compliments the movie as a great after-movie DVD

Disk 5 contains Alien 3.  While not as good as Alien and Aliens, the 3rd movie can be brilliant in its own way.  What makes owning this so great is the restored Working Print for the movie. Not only is the working print version far superior, I feel, but they also managed to find the script for the scenes and put in subtitles for where there would be dialogue.
Disk 6 once again contains lots of bonus content

Disk 7 contains Alien: Resurrection , the weakest of the 4 movies that just got weaker as it went along I feel.  Still it completes the Alien movies and is a must have for a fan.
Disk 8 contains bonus content for Alien: Resurrection

** Disk 9 contains additional bonus features, such as documentaries , artwork and even digs up the content that was on the old Alien laser-disk releases.  A great disk to round out a very impressive package.

Overall this is a must have box set.  In fact it sets a new standard for what Box Sets should be like.  The volume of bonus content here is staggering, and throw in 2 masterpiece movies and 2 fairly decent ones as well... science fiction.. aliens.. action this is a winner.

I use a PS3 and Sharp HDTV for viewing and all the movies look amazing, especially Alien, which is still artistically my favorite of the series.

The packaging is the only area that leaves room for debate, it's nice but the fold out book style while being cool, I'd rather have the traditional little pop-hub spindle type thing to hold them into place, instead you've got basically paper sleeves to slide the discs in and out of and it's hard not to smudge the discs with your fingers etc. No big deal overall though.

Watching 'Alien' again on Blu-Ray was like watching a movie for the very first time. I saw details that never occurred to me to even look for while watching it on DVD - my only fault is the ""Mu. Th.

I was expecting a larger book but it came very compact, which is nice if you have a large dvd collection like I have.  The book is really cool because the pages are a nice thick board that has colorful stills from the movies.  I also liked the 'green' packaging.  I know that some reviewers didn't like the disc sleeves but after fumbling with the old fold out set I find the discs to be very easy to access and of course with no plastic it is environmentally correct.

1956355,5,B0000VCZK2,"I received this blu-ray box as a gift a few weeks ago. Hadn't really had a chance to watch it until last night. I watched Alien and Aliens (the second movie) last night. Man... this was a very impressive transfer to blu-ray! I have all the Alien movies on DVD. I had Alien and Aliens movie on VHS as well. I remember that comparing the VHS to the DVD was so nice and clean. The jump from DVD to blu-ray is an even bigger jump. I first watched Aliens (part 2), and the images were so clean... no graininess at all. The sound was really the best part. They really did the audio well.

But the biggest surprise was the original Alien. From the very start of the movie, the interior of the space shuttle scene looks like it was filmed around 10 years ago. Yes, the actual props look old, but the movie itself looks no where near 30 years old that it already is. So I thought perhaps it was just that scene, but as the movie goes on, every scene is so clean. Great contrast balance, great sharpness, you can see detailed skin texture like you can on blu-ray discs now. And even though the original movie is only in 4.0 surround, the sound engineers did a great great job of transferring that to a full HD format. Awesome sound the whole way through.

I can't say I've see too many older movies in blu-ray, but I've seen a fair amount. And seriously, this is by far the best transition from an older movie to blu-ray!

For any fan, it's definitely worth the purchase.",1306281600,8,1461,4.2671480144404335
1956356,5,B0000VCZK2,"Alien is one of the mos terrifying films of all time. It is clostrophobic, suspensful, and keeps even a multiple time viewer on the edge of their seat. The set decoration is absolutely magnificent. The cast is perfect. The music is beautful. The creature's design is not of this world. Alien is one of the greatest creature films to ever be created. It ranks at the very top along with King Kong, Creature from the Black Lagoon, and The Wolf Man among the greatest science fiction horror creature films ever created.

Aliens is a high energ level sequel that ups the anty in every way. You have an army of aliens, being given birth to by...____. There is plot on top of plot featuring Burk, Ripley, and all the other characters in the film. Stan Winston created amazing looking creatures in this high energy action packed adventurious sequel to the amazing original terrifying science fiction classic.

Alien 3 finds Ripley on a maximum security prison planet along with murderers and rapists. Of course the predators become the prey as the tables are turned on these violent criminals when an alien finds its way onto their planet. There are two destinctively different versions of this film. They are like watching two different films entirely and are both amazing films, but for different reasons.

Alien Resurrection is probably the weak link of this franchise. Frankly every franchise has to have a ""worst of them all,"" and this film is it, but that doesn't mean it is a bad film by any stretch of the imagionation. That just simply means it is not as good as the first three. However, the evolution of the creatures is fantastic. They can learn more and do things they could never do before. This is a fun filled exciting film filled with social commentary on genetic cloning and fun action packed chase sequences.

Fox put a lot of work into this release. The picture quality on each and every film and every version (including the work print edition of Alien 3) all look so good, it was like they were made yesterday. The ultra amazing sound allows one to turn up their 5.1 surround sound systems and blow the walls off of ther houses. This box set is also cram packed with over 60 hours of extra features, including online interactive features that can keep one busy for over a year after purchase.

Arguably anything that was released in previous DVD or laserdisc editions have been ported over (some if not most in hd!) and it's very easy to access whatever material you're looking for, especially with the interactive Mu-Th-Ur mode. The enchancement pods (brief featurettes) add even more info for every film. The previously censored Alien 3 documentary (Wreckage and Rage) is presented here uncut with more footage and candid moments from David Fincher. Speaking of which, the special edition cut of Alien 3 is improved in the scenes with bad or no audio - the actors were brought back for dubbing work and the rough cut plays better now.

I have a 7.2 surround sound system capable of reproducing all known codecs to include DDTRUEHD and DTS-HDMA and a 50 inch plasma.  This was the best showing of Alien and Aliens that I have ever seen to include the first time I watched Alien in the theater.

1956377,5,B0000VCZK2,"The ""Alien Anthology"" has been long-awaited in high definition goodness pretty much since the technology hit the market.  This is one of the sets everyone wanted and was eager to see how the technology would make these films look and sound, with only ""Star Wars"" and ""Indiana Jones"" perhaps being more anticipated.  There was much pre-release speculation that this might be a letdown, especially after James Cameron (who was deeply involved with the restoration of ""Alien"" made some comments about ""de-graining"" it which had purists reeling with concern that it was a victim of the dreaded digital noise reduction , leaving it with a waxy, smeared look (much like the recent release of ""Predator).  I am happy to report this set not only meets all expectations, but exceeds them.  Each film looks brilliant in 1080p high definition.  The films have been restired frame by frame with the original directors supervising and even technical problems that plagued the prior releases have been corrected.  I could go film by film but it would be an exercise in redundance as they all look fabulous, grain structures have been kept in tact.  ""Aliens"" did have some DNR applied, but for good reason given how bad it looked before.  The cameras that were used at the time were supposed to be state of the art, however, they were recalled the year after this was hot.  The film grain remains in tact, but the scratchy noise which washed out the color scheeme is gone.  These films have never looked better since they were each in the editing bays.  The soundtracks for each is a bombastic DTS-HD MA 5.1, and it's everything you would hope for.  ""Alien"" in particular ( made in 1978, released in '79) looks and sounds like it was shot yesterday.  Your house will shake every time a ship passes the screen.  Directional effects on all the films are awesome.  I heard sound effects I have never heard before thanks to the lossless encode.  ""Aliens"", the most action heavy, will blow you out of your seat and pulverize the listening area.  Alien 3 looks spectacular with David Fincher perfecting the visual look that would follow his films up to the recent ""The Social Network.""  ""Alien Resurrection"" probably fares the best of the bunch, as it was the most recently made, and the colors just pop off the screen and the gunshots and explosions are deafening.

The special features are the most comprehensive, exhaustive set I have ever seen on any DVD release.  There are too many to list here, but there are dozens of featurettes, documentaries, all films have audio commentaries, isolated scores, etc.  Each film comes with an extended edition.  This is a first-rate DVD set and it is everything we fans could have hoped for.  This is the best these films will ver look and sound and with all the special features this makes this set a no-brainer.  Even if some may find the price a bit steep, you are getting 4 films, each with the director's cut and theatrical editions mastered at the highest level of quality.  Think of it as an investment and something you will enjoy over and over.  The special features alone will take viewers a long time to get through.

Finally it comes down to Sigourney Weaver to dispatch the demon bastard - or bitch.  Great production design and directing still generate delicious visceral thrills on a hi-def TV in a dark room.

The first two discs, Alien and Aliens were rated very high in terms of picture quality and sound. The second two movies Aliens3 and Alien Resurrection were rated lower but still acceptable.

My rating is excellent for Alien and good for Alien3 and Alien Resurrection. The problem is with Aliens which I would rate poor. There is a constant flicker of the picture during dimmer scenes. This is most distracting, I returned the first copy to Amazon and received another which demonstrated the same Problem, I return it.

Being a big fan of this movie I decided to order Alien Anthology direct from Fox Connect, thinking that I would have better luck buying direct from Fox, the movie company. Well guess what the same problem of the flickering picture on Aliens. I called them and they sent me an individual disc of Aliens.  Same problem again!!!

I have a high end Theater System so I know my system is not the problem. I even tried the Aliens disc in another Blu-Ray player..same problem. When I called Fox and discussed the problem they said try attaching the HDMI cable direct to the TV...same problem.

Whatever the problem is it has ruined an otherwise great movie collection.",1299715200,2,1275,4.751131221719457

This version has cleared up the muddiness in the dark scenes that seemed to plague the LD versions; this is especially true in Alien where entrance is made into the alien vessel.

All told the set has excellent sound and video; absolutely no complaints there. I did encounter one problem with my OPPO which required an upgrade but that came through and now they play without any problem.

1956381,5,B0000VCZK2,"When the Alien Quadrilogy was released in 2003, it was a truly impressive set for fans of the franchise, containing both the theatrical, and extended or director's cuts of all four films [Alien (1979), Aliens (1986), Alien 3 (1992) and Alien Resurrection (1997)].  In additional each film had a separate disc with bonus materials, and finally there was a ninth disc with even more bonus materials related to the series.  At the time the set was premium priced, but given the quantity and quality of the material, The Quadrilogy was one set that really gave you your money's worth, far superior to the four disc Alien Legacy (1999) set.

The Blu-ray set, Alien Anthology (2010), is currently regarded as the best versions of these films available.  The Quadrilogy is out of production, and may have lost some of its luster, but it is still a fantastic collection, and can be found used, at very reasonable prices, as Alien fans look to upgrade to the Blu-ray set.  The Quadrilogy is a great buy for casual fans who may not have all of these films.  The bonus material is prodigious, highly informative, and helps place these films in historical context.  About the only disappointment is that there is very little heard from David Fincher, the director of Alien 3.  Unfortunately, Fincher's side of the story regarding the making of Alien 3, has to this day, yet to be adequately told.

A true classic in the realm of science fiction, the Alien films are each distinct, and featured directors who at the time were relatively unheralded.  Ridley Scott (Black Hawk Down, Blade Runner, Gladiator, Body of Lies), James Cameron (Titanic, Terminator 2, Avatar, True Lies), and David Fincher (Se7en, Zodiac, Panic Room, The Game, The Social Network) have all had rather illustrious post-Alien careers.  Alien Resurrection director Jean Pierre Jenut's work may not be as well-known outside of France, but many of his films (Micmacs, Amelie, The City Of Lost Children), have generally been very well regarded critically.  Sigorney Weaver has been the backbone of the series as Ellen Ripley, the role that has defined her career. The evolution and growth of the character has been both interesting, and quite remarkable.

For hours of excitement, and an in depth journey into the creative process and significance of the Alien films, the Quadrilogy could be a fantastic addition to your collection.",1299369600,2,2387,4.982367758186398

Don't!

The plastic egg is just awful, but even worse the cardboard case that holds the discs is shoddy and cheap.  Unless you like kitschy, plastic baubles, the egg is DEFINITELY not a collectible item.  It'd be far more worthwhile to buy the $99 version of the film at Amazon, then put the $50 towards a truly excellent polystone or resin piece over at Sideshow.

1956402,5,B0000VCZK2,"This Quadrilogy boxset gives us the four Alien films in theatrical and special edition formats, as well as some superb extras. The extras include `making of ` featurettes, photos, commentaries and much more. Each extra disc gives you another insight into the Alien films and philosophy. Then with subsequent viewings you can't help but see the extra details in the films with a fresh eye.

`Alien' is a film that has stood the test of time remarkably well.

Following a crew on a large mining space ship, we see what happens to them when they pick up a distress signal and encounter an alien life form. Despite the age of this film the special effects are still remarkably creepy and at times could still rival films of today. The sets are the parts of this film that seem the most dated, but even these add a certain kitschy charm. This film spawned a movie franchise that went on for decades, but this is the one that held the most suspense, despite later ones having more gore and violence. Re-watching it today I was surprised just how creepy and eerie it was compared to what I remembered.

This is acted and directed well and the alien effects are still impressive and coupled with a good storyline this makes for one superb sci-fi/horror film. A classic that should be watched at least once in your lifetime.

Set 57 years after the end of the first Alien film, `Aliens' sees Ripley returning to the Alien planet, now an off Earth Colony, to confront her old nemesis.

After contact is lost with the colony Marines are sent in, with Ripley as a consultant to investigate. We meet Newt, a young girl who manages to survive by hiding in the air ducts, and who brings out Ripley's maternal instincts, and Bishop, an android who Ripley finds hard to trust. There is also a team of US marines with an annoying `in your face' gung ho attitude, but who serve a purpose in the fight against the acid blooded, parasitic aliens.

This was directed by James Cameron after his success with `Terminator' and if you are familiar with this film the directional style will be very familiar, but it's a style that works very well for the sci-fi genre. This film is less atmospheric and creepy than the first film and is more action orientated, with lots of gun fights, explosions and shouting. This is also the film we see Ripley become the badass she has to be to survive the aliens.

This is an excellent sequel to the original film and whilst it is louder and with more action, it adds to the story very well indeed and compliments the original perfectly. Some say this is the best film in the series and it is definitely a very credible, exciting film, with a great plotline. You'll just have to watch them all to make up your own mind.

`Alien 3' is probably one of the weaker films in the Alien series, but saying that it is still a good sci-fi film and worth a watch at some point.

When her hypersleep is disturbed and her pod is ejected into space, Ripley awakens to find herself on a penal colony surrounded by hardened criminals. She also finds herself facing her old nemesis once again after it stowed away on her ship.

This film moves at a slower pace to `Aliens' and has none of the suspense or creepiness of `Alien', but it does move the story forwards in a credible way and introduces us to the Alien in it's four legged guise. This alien is able to run a lot faster and also scurry across ceilings in it's search for prey.

The various inmates are clichd and rather two dimensional and the only character of note isn't in the film long enough to keep it elevated. Weaver plays Ripley well, as always, and her shaven, harrowed look shows the stresses her character has been under perfectly.

This is a decent, but not outstanding, sci-fi film and will always be the poor relation to the previous Alien films. It is well worth watching and is entertaining enough for the duration, just don't expect the suspense or high action of previous instalments.

When Ripley is cloned to gain access to the alien queen inside of her, her genetic material became bonded with that of the alien. Giving her fast healing capabilities and super-human strength the Ripley of before is now supercharged and a formidable adversary to any alien she may encounter.

`Alien Resurrection' is set 200 years after `Alien 3', but not much has changed. The company (in a new guise) wants the alien for military purposes and Ripley wants to stop that from happening, only this time she as split loyalties dues to her genetic mutation. Winona Rider is a member of a smuggling crew caught up in the melee and whilst she is ok in this film, her elfin image doesn't really sit with a hardened sci-fi action film.

The direction is pretty good and Weaver is as good as she has ever been. She has a darker streak in this film and it suits her. The alien effects are also still good and in this film we see the aliens swim, as well as meeting a new incarnation that I won't say more about here to maintain the surprise.

All in all this is a decent sequel in the series and I enjoy it at least as much as `Alien 3' but, like that film, it never matches the creepiness of `Alien' or the action of `Aliens'. Still, this is well worth watching if you have seen the rest and makes for a fairly decent sci-fi film.

So, overall this is an excellent value-for-money boxset, giving you way more than many other boxsets of a similar or greater price and it offers up some classic sci-fi films to boot.

Namely, every once in a while a chapter title and timeline pops up, then disappears after a few seconds.  If this happened only once or twice it would be bearable, but after a while it starts happening with every chapter change.  This same problem has occurred on LG and Toshiba players.

Another oddity is that in order to get the sound to play, I have to load and boot up Alien, stop and eject it, then load and start it again.

Minor problems perhaps, but this is the first time I have had any trouble playing Blu-Ray disks on my player, and that includes some just-released items.  This is the only reason I would not give this collection five stars.

1956407,4,B0000VCZK2,"Rejoice all you blu-ray owners, the Alien blu-ray Anthology is here and lives up to it's name. For any of you who have not seen these films (which are excellent, by the way) you can fear not, as I'm reviewing the product, not the films themselves. In short: No Spoilers in this review!

The packaging is outstanding and was defect free when received. The outer cover picturing the Xenomorph (the alien) is gorgeous. Inside the films are enclosed in a book-like holder that is lithographed with photos from the films and the teaser information from the original movie cover-backs. All in all it's exceptionally well done and a definite upgrade from the DVD Alien Quadrilogy release a few years ago. While aesthetically it looks the same, feels the same, and has all the features of the Alien Quadrilogy release the blu-ray upgrade is noticeably better in both picture and sound on my HDTV and 5.1 surround system.

My only gripes with the Alien Anthology release are the way the discs are placed inside the holder they could scratch over time with repeated use. I'm assured that blu-ray discs are exceptionally scratch resistant but in my opinion this could be done better as a preventative measure. The only other thing is the upgraded codecs for the films will not work unless your blu-ray has had a software upgrade. As such some first generation blu-ray's I've heard of having a big problem with that. My Samsung HB-500 is internet connected and the upgrade took less than a minute. For me it isn't a problem but for some folks who may live out of reach of a high-speed internet connection (there are still internet dark-zones out there, don't let anyone fool you) will not be able to play the collection on their systems. I don't quite understand the need to have devices that require an upgrade of this kind with new releases. DVD never had this problem and I feel it's a gross oversight with companies scrabbling over giving the newest features to users.

Don't let my review fool you. It's a great product and for the significantly reduced prices that Amazon offers it's a little easier to justify than $140 at Best Buy.",1294012800,,2127,4.727762803234501

Out of all the Blu-Rays I have rented and watched this remastered set is the sharpest and best sounding.  I can't begin to tell you how awesome they are to see fully restored.  I have seen all 4 of these movies several times and they never get old.  Even the 3rd and 4th movie was enjoyable since they sounded and looked so good.  The extras are a completist's dream.  There are so many extras that it will take you hours upon hours to watch them all.  Ridley Scott is making a prequel to the first movie that he made, Alien.  It is rumored that he is trying to get Leonardo DiCaprio to star in it with a cast of unknows by his side.  Whether this is true or not you, the reader, owe it to yourself to pick this up at $69.99 before it goes back to $99.99 or more.  It is very expensive but when you think that blu-rays are usually $20 each and you are getting 4 movies + 2 discs of extras then it is worth it.  I would recommend this pack all the way up to $89.99.  Above that and it is too expensive.  The only fault of this package is the blu-ray sleeves.  The packaging is gorgeous but it is difficult to get the discs out.  Thus, I recommend putting them into a separate case logic case for repeated viewing.

1956412,5,B0000VCZK2,"I have always loved the Aliens movies. I believe that Aliens was the first one I had watched and I loved it. I was in middle school. I continued to watch that movie every chance I got. I also loved the first one after seeing Aliens more that one. I was never disappointed whenever I put those VHS tapes in.

However, they all were released on blu-ray and I was ecstatic. Seeing movies I loved growing up were now in the best format possible with all of the special features available.

Until I tried playing them. I live in America, bought it from Amazon USA and expected no problems. Everytime I try to play these movies I get the red screen that says ""An update is required for your blu ray player in order for this disc to play"". I called 20th century fox about the problem. They told be to delete the BD data folder because competitors sometimes install codes on their discs that could prevent discs from other companies to play on the PS3. I did that and the movies still did not play. And yes, my PS3 has the latest firmware. Right now it's at v 3.55. After that didn't work I called a second time and the person had no other solution for me. She also mentioned that there had been no none other issues with these blu ray discs which eliminates a random manufacturing flaw.

That did not work so I called back and they told me that I would have to call Sony. I called Sony and they were very thorough with their troubleshooting which seemed promising. I did everything they mentioned. The final task was completely rebooting the PS3 and reinstalling the software. I was really excited because I had exhausted all other possibilities and assumed that since no one else had complained about this movie package that it would have fixed it. Unfortunately, no. I reinstalled the entire software yet the movies still don't work.

Avatar (which is also distributed by Fox) does not work. It's obvious that it's a firmware issue because when I bought Avatar back in October, it played just fine. Then after I upgraded the PS3 to v 3.55, it no longer works.

If anyone has any solution, please comment. I have been wanting to watch these movies for several weeks now and its really unfortunate that neither the blu-ray manufacturer (Sony) nor the movie distribution company (20th Century Fox) has a solution.

Nov/11 Update: I'm pretty late posting this, but now my PS3 plays this set just fine. One of the recent firmware updates fixed it. Who knows.",1293667200,3,2448,4.5396825396825395

1956416,5,B0000VCZK2,"As soon as the trailer for this set was shown at San Diego Comic Con this year,I knew this is the one set that needed to be in my collection. The price by Amazon was the best I'd seen yet. The overall packaging for the set is really well done. Having less discs this time is much better than 9 in the Quadrilogy set. Now to the meat of this review-The overall video quality varies between the 4 movies. For Alien & Aliens,I would have to give a 5 out of 5. The video is the best I've ever seen for these two movies anywhere. As far as Alien 3,a 4.5 would be appropriate as some of the video in certain parts were a little softer than expected,but to have the extended version with newly remastered audio for the beginning is a definite plus. Alien Resurrection was the least of my favorites,but it looked great-4 out of 5. The audio for all 4 was OUTSTANDING-crisp,clear,and booming in all the right places. All extras were the most comprehensive anywhere. Definitely recommended!",1293321600,,980,4.45
1956417,5,B0000VCZK2,"Well what's there to say about this latest Alien box set that hasn't already been said. I got it shortly after I told myself I wasn't going to get it thanks to an Amazon one day sale that made it cheaper than what I had originally paid for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-Quadrilogy-Alien-Aliens-Alien-3-Alien-Resurrection/dp/B0000VCZK2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien Quadrilogy (Alien/ Aliens /Alien 3 /Alien Resurrection)</a>&nbsp;and it seemed quite worth it at that point.
I was a bit disappointed after my viewing of the second film, not with the film it's self but with the quality of the transfer. Aliens was really buggy and had lots of flicker and grain, I don't really mind the grain and I can't figure out if the flickering is a problem with my display set up or with the actual transfer I'm guessing it's the former since I haven't seen any other complaints about it but honestly I was expecting a little bit better treatment for arguably the biggest film in the franchise. The DVD version on the Quadrilogy set didn't have any of this flickering in the darker scenes and holds up just about as well under scrutiny. Like I said, I don't mind grain in a film that's better than 20 years old but I've yet to find a reason for this weird flickering it does. Since I'm more fond of the theatrical version of Aliens as opposed to the extended version I was thinking maybe they were lazy and just used an old transfer for the theatrical and remastered the extended for Blu-Ray but upon viewing that version all the same problems are present. I've adjusted every possible setting and I can't get rid of this flicker, it's not a huge deal it's just kinda distracting. James Cameron mentions in the commentary some technical aspects of the film stock used for this film that was far to technical and involved for me to understand without a degree from film school but what little I could glean from the director mentioned something to the fact that the film used was very prone to grain and other problems, so I think that explains away some of the problems with this transfer. There's only so much the remastering process can do, I guess.
The sound on this film has always been one of the standout parts of the movie and it gets a really nice treatment in the HD 5.1, there's lots of subtle sound effects that are mixed to perfection and simplified enough so that even if you don't have a big whopper of a sound system it still sounds great on your regular TV output. This is usually something I'm concerned with since I watch movies mostly late at night and don't wanna keep the neighbors up listening to Alien Queens screeching.
This is one of the all time great sci-fi films and it's James Cameron at his best, in my humble opinion I just wish Fox would have spent a little money restoring it for this particular release. I'd also like to mention that it has one of the most entertaining commentary tracks I've ever heard and if I'm not mistaken it won some kind of DVD award back in '03

Ok the evaluation of the Aliens disc is over so I'm sure 75% people stopped reading that's why I went ahead and started with the second movie instead of the first.
Alien, is a fantastic looking transfer it looks totally new. If Sigourney Weaver weren't running around looking like a doe-eyed teenager through the whole film I'd think it came out this year. I mean someone put some serious work into this, although this transfer is not exclusive to this disc, it's the same one used from the Quadrilogy set. If you remember the film was released back into theaters shortly before or after the Quad set came out, I can't remember exactly but I know the film was restored from the ground up for this anniversary event this Blu-Ray just features the highest possible quality of that particular transfer/remaster. The sound is as good as I've ever heard for this particular film, I've noticed a lot of little sound effects and even been able to discern some words out of the muttering a lot of the characters did in the film without having to crank my sound system up to 40 (it only goes to 30) just to make out what they're saying. I guess that has something to do with the HD audio as opposed to the now standard 5.1 mix. I've watched both versions although I'm more fond of the theatrical version again.

Alien 3, is a sharp looking film, seeing it in high def brings a new appreciation to the beautiful sets and art direction, at least it did for me and I've seen this movie a million times... Alien 3? You know the one with the Alien eating all the baddie baldies that no one cares about and holy cow Ripley has also become a baddie baldy and oh no there's a Alien in her too what should we too, how about we all commit suicide by alien just because we hate the company that much. I admit it's not the greatest film in the world but it does have some shining moments here and there. I like it, I still think it was a solid sci-fi flick if only for the mood it created and taking the established Alien series staple of a ""used future"" to the most extreme of extremes. David Fincher is one of my favorite directors because he seems to pay extra attention to the atmosphere subtle background noise can create and in the HD 5.1 mix it really comes out. Also concerning the sound, people who've already bought the Alien Quadrilogy will be happy to know that all the audio in the ""Workprint"" version has been fixed and it plays just like a normal movie instead of something Fox stole back from the internet and slapped on a DVD.
The picture on this film is quite crisp and sharp looking I don't have any complaints about the visual or sound on this disc. It may in fact be the best looking film in the whole set if you can stand the unbelievable crap of the story of the film, it's a pleasure to look at though and exceptionally sound designed.

The forth and final film, so far, Ridley Scott has a forward written onto this box set that mentions a prequel film, I've been hearing about one of those since Alien 3 so I'm not going to get my hopes up too high. This movie looks only slightly better on Blu-Ray then the DVD for a film this new I would have expected it to be a little more sharp in HD. Darius Khandji's photography comes out really nicely though. The sharp contrasts and deep dark blacks show up really nicely although mostly this film just seems brown, everything is brown in this movie, even the Aliens are brown! I can't tell if this version is any better than the DVD because honestly I don't know how many different ways there are to convey the color brown regardless of it's encoding. The space shots, the underwater scene all look pretty good though and like I said where there is a contrast between brown and another color it looks really nice. I won't even begin to get into how crap this movie is, but I will say this, it's probably got the most spins in my PS3 since I bought this set mainly because it's the easiest movie of the lot to pick up since there's not much of a story and it's not a very long film.
This film is a shining example as to why your director should speak the same language as the cast. Jean-Pierre Jeunet has made some fantastic French films this is his only ""bad"" film and not really a bad film but directing actors through an interpreter had to be quite a hindrance. I can barely give directions to the nearest gas station when someone interprets into Spanish for me so I don't even want to imagine what getting a performance out of an actor was like for him. Not the greatest film ever but I think it's watchable and at it's lowest points nowhere near as bad as either AvP film.

I was really wanting to type up a short review before I left for work tonight, but apparently I've gotten a bit verbose I apologize to anyone still reading I really am trying to be as concise as possible.
This is basically a Blu-Ray version of the previous Quadrilogy set with a few added features, mainly short videos and images here and there, as far as the BRD exclusives are concerned. All of the commentaries and virtually everything is from 2003 so basically Fox just double-dipped the material into a more expensive package. The biggest bonus is that it's not such a hassle to open and get a disc out, everything is contained in a simple little book that holds each disc in it's own page. All the special features from the Quad are contained on one disc while every other stitch of Alien related media is on the final disc.
A bit about the Blu-Ray exclusives; ""Disc-Unbound"" is a pretty cool idea, a six disc set that also features ""Muther-Mode"" where you can select a list of related features throughout the course of a film and then after the film pop in the related disc and play those selections. Kinda a cool idea it's just a shame this is all stuff I have seen a dozen times watching the Quad set. Also all the different audio tracks, subtitled commentaries so if you want to watch the movie with it's audio playing and just read the commentary, which is what I usually do is pretty neat. Isolated scores and on some films totally alternate isolated film scores are also neat in a fanboy way.

I gave this set 5 stars for being the perfected version of the old Quadrilogy set which was a 4 star set at best. But in the long run you're not getting much more than the Quad in sleek new packaging with some neat new little gimmicks.
I'd like to mention a bit about the packaging, I've never seen anything so sleek and well thought out with the fans in mind. Where with most box sets they just slap a bunch of discs in a generic box and ship it out and sell it to the public. This has got to be one of the most unique designs I've ever seen, it features a book like layout and each disc fits into it's own page with a double wide splash page between each disc. It's a dream compared to all the unfolding and dropping that came with the folding cardboard nine disc layout in the old Quad set.

In closing I'd like to mention that if you're looking for the most bang for your buck the old Quad set costs about what this one does and has just about everything this set has to offer minus some minor bonuses, I recommend it if you've got the cash but at the same time the frugal person in me would have probably just bought the Quadrilogy instead. I'm sure they'll release the movies in individual form sooner or later so if you really don't want the third and fourth films I'd just wait for that.",1293235200,,10474,4.435617860851505

The Alien Anthology collection contains all four Alien movies with a boat-load of extras, two discs alone are just for extras. In space, no one can hear you scream and if you watch all 60 hours of content and view all 12,000 photo images, no one will ever see you for days. All four movies have completely different tones. While eventually each has at least one alien to make a pile of bodies, that is about all they have in common. Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" is a suspenseful horror movie, James Cameron's ""Aliens"" is a sci-fi spectacle of entertainment, and ""Alien 3"" is a drama about religion, society, and isolation. ""Alien: Resurrection"" just gets into a very weird fan-fiction type fantasy. Spoilers to follow.

Before jumping into the extras, I started on Halloween with a marathon of all the movies. Starting with ""Alien"", I passed on the 1979 theatrical version to watch the 2003 Director's cut edition with the introduction by Ridley Scott. Scott claims to have been fully satisfied with the film for years not wanting to change it, but then a few years ago decided to make some changes to improve it (or as I call it, go ""Lucas"" on it). I'm sure he just added content and length to the film as all the other films did. In this film, we meet Lieutenant Ripley played by Sigourney Weaver for the first time, a strong woman who follows protocol and is second-in-command on the ship until their captain meets an untimely demise. They were awoken early from hyper sleep to investigate a strange signal so they land on a planet to investigate and strange things happen. She elected to follow protocol and keep the infection out of the ship and another crew member later revealed to be a Droid working for the company instead let it in knowing full well what would happen. The first infamous alien-bursting-out-of-the-chest occurred, Ripley's prejudice against Droids developed after nearing being killed by one, and Ripley fought the good fight to save a cat and become the sole human survivor of the experience. The effects were practical and the movie looks fantastic and still holds up today. I've only seen it a few times and parts of it still make me jump! The character Ripley was important because she was one of the toughest female characters ever in a movie and held her own. Not many women led an entire movie during that time.

Then James Cameron, master of the epic movie took on the series. Before ""Titanic"" and ""Avatar"", this film and ""Terminator 2"" were his claims to fame cementing him in the sci-fi genre. I again bypass the 1986 theatrical edition in favor of the 1991 (no hesitation to add stuff here!) edition with introduction by Cameron mostly just to cite all the additional stuff he wanted to put in and now could (not surprising). In my opinion, this is the best of the series and the popular favorite. The premise of the creatures is already established so all they had to do was pull Ripley out of space, explain that everything she once knew was gone, and accuse her of lying and making the ship self destruct for no reason. Instead of charging her for losses to ""The Company"", they send her back to the planet she picked up the alien on in the first place in hopes of reestablishing contact with the colony grown there. She gets combat soldiers to accompany her including one of the most buff women I have ever seen in my life who can do backwards pull ups and Bill Paxton in the best performance of his life (""Game over man, it's game over!"").

My father-in-law used to use ""Aliens"" as a teaching tool for showing how to act in a stressful situation. Ripley and Hicks keep their heads level and try to think of solutions. Bill Paxton's reactions as Hudson were like a play-by-play in what not to do in terms of panicking and negative group thinking. In this movie, the cat has been replaced by a little girl named Newt. If Ripley can just save this little blond girl with a fantastic scream, all will be good in the world. She has to learn to trust an Android in order to make this happen. This movie just does everything right in terms of effects, speed of storytelling, character development, and keeping the whole thing exciting. You actually care about the characters and the size of the giant guns being toted around while impractical is pretty bad-[...]

Now I moved on to ""Alien 3"" with the little 3 so it's an exponential amount of aliens. Passed over the 1992 version for the ""restored workprint version"" from 2003, directed by David Fincher. Ripley actually made it out with some friends last time so they automatically all died during the journey where she crash lands on a prison planet. The prisoners are no longer held captive and have adapted a religion, shaved heads, and a monk-like lifestyle but are seething with potential violence. Ripley gets a G.I. Jane haircut and instantly goes on a search for which of the bodies may have been impregnated with an alien and eventually discovers it's her (oops).

In this film, it's hard to get a picture for the layout of the joint, where people are and why they are lingering there. With the bald heads, it's even difficult to tell who is who sometimes. The audio mixing is an issue because there are really long, quiet conversations and then loud battle scenes. This film uses almost completely CGI aliens and it looks really obvious compared to the old practical effects. The aliens move smoother and more fluidly, but it still looks unnatural with the backgrounds and lighting. Over two hours in to this extended cut, I fell asleep at 1:00 a.m. I came back a few days later to catch the last thirty to forty minutes where bodies continued to pile up (as they tend to do), Bishop made a reappearance in a different way, and Ripley decided to take a backwards swan dive into a convenient furnace to avoid scientific study.

I watched the 2003 Special Edition version of ""Alien: Resurrection"" with an introduction by director, Jean-Pierre Jeunet who helpfully declares that you will not be seeing the version you say in 1997, but the newer version he edited together in 2003. Seeing that the screenplay was written by Joss Whedon made sense with the whole band of bandits get stuck in a situation, we all try to grow, one woman has superpowers theme. Somehow despite her incineration at the end of ""Alien 3"", they managed to find blood samples of her left on the planet, cloned her, extracted the queen as they always wished to do, and encourage the queen to breed. The Ripley clone begins with a child-like understanding of the world around her, but has retained her memory through a vague scientific explanation, and super strength. Baby face Winona Ryder, Hellboy, and a few others show up at this space lab and throw things off a little. One of the biggest reasons this movie is a fail is that Winona Ryder is entirely TOO whiny offering up lots of complaints, but little substance or help to the mission. Saying you want to stop the aliens and doing it are two different things and she keeps snubbing the super-human Ripley who might be the only one to successfully take them on.

The Blu-ray high definition looks great on each of these films. There are only a few moments I noticed a significant grainy quality like in the second movie

Bonus Features:

Anything and everything you could EVER want to know or find out about the Alien series. Every movie has the original version as well as the updated version of the film, audio commentary by directors, actors, and crew, isolated score tracks in case you want to feel the music and avoid that pesky dialogue, deleted and extended scenes, and the MU-TH-UR Mode Interactive Experience with Weyland-Yutani Datastream.

On the two additional discs just for extras, there are over 12 hours of documentaries and five hours of video Enhancement Pods presenting more behind-the-scenes footage, dailies in raw form, and interview outtakes from all four films. They can be watched separately or you can click on them while watching the other features. For each film, there are features on developing the story (or continuing the story), casting and characterization, creature design, weapons and action, music, visual effects, sound, and just in case you needed it, ""In the Zone: The Basketball Scene"" where Ripley goes one-on-one with Hellboy and throws up a backward ""nothing but net"" on her way out of the room.

Disc Six is where it gets REALLY nerdy for the collector as it is jam-packed full of notes, story boards, pictures, conceptual art, screen tests, additional deleted scenes, trailers & tv spots, and more details for each of the four films. I cannot even begin to cover all this to review it so let me just say that this is the MU-TH-UR-load and if you need everything Alien EVER (besides that series called AVP aka Alien vs Predator), this is the set.",1292025600,3,8852,4.692852543464262
1956426,5,B0000VCZK2,"What can I say that hasn't already be said? This set is the ultimate Blu-ray compilation. Practically anything fans of the films ever wanted to know, see or hear can be found here. The presentation is unbelievably cool with detailed information scrolling on screen at the menus about creatures, vehicles, locations, etc. The amount of extras is staggering and will take some time to go through, but that's a good thing.

Some have complained about having too much stuff included and asking who needs more than the films themselves. Uh...WHAT?! Personally, I have a hard time grasping the concept of someone complaining about getting too much for their money. Makes no sense to me...about as much sense as some gamers complaining about too much to do in a video game.

If you're a die hard fan of the Alien films...ANY of them...you'll find plenty here to satisfy.

My only complaint about the set is the removal of one piece of behind the scenes footage. Originally, it was intended to have footage of James Remar playing Hicks in Aliens. James Remar was originally cast as the marine corporal, but was replaced by Michael Biehn shortly after principal photography began due to ""creative differences"" with writer/director James Cameron. The footage was removed before release of this set at the request of Cameron's production company Lightstorm Entertainment. As to why, your guess is as good as mine. Maybe someone will be kind enough to put it on YouTube someday.

1956428,4,B0000VCZK2,"This is a must have for all fans (with blue-ray disc players, of course)! I really enjoyed the Alien franchise!

1. ALIEN- a great movie! A great story to tell about seven humans landing on an unknown planet and picking up an alien that slaughters them one-by-one!
I liked it very much a good blend of drama, a few laughs, and suspense! A bit slow at times, but plays out nicely! My grade: A- or Four Stars!

2. ALIENS- an excellent flick! One of few sequels that beats the original in many ways! Full of excitement! Full of action! Some laughs! A lot of suspense! And more...! Great and memorable characters! My grade: A+ or Five Stars!

3. ALIEN 3- bad, just flat out bad! A waste! A disgrace to the alien franchise!
What was bad about it?:
1. All the characters who fought through hell to survive in the last movie die at the very beginning!
2. There was no plot to the movie!
3. Too much whispering!
4. They butcher the F-word!
5. Too slow!
6. All the main characters in this movie die as well!

My dear reader, my list of complains with this movie go on and on... the only thing you need to know about this movie is that Ripley / Sigourney Weaver dies at the end. Bottom line; avoid this piece of crap, just go to the fourth movie instead! My grade: F or One Star!

4. Alien Resurrection- corrects a lot of the mistakes that Alien 3 made but still lacks some of the charm of the first two movies! The plot was good, the action strong! And each character served a purpose! A big improvement over the last one! My grade: B or Three-and-a-half Stars!

Well that was my review on all four movies! I enjoyed three of these movies as you just read, but hey, it was just my opinion.

I respect other's opinions but like the incessant whining about the price, you knew it was a 4 movie set before you bought it, get over it. Now for my rant: they load slow due to all the ""crap"" razzle dazzle that it seems have been forced upon us by either the studios to make more $$ or from idiots that need, want or crave  for some completely insane BS instead of the MOVIES! OK, end of rant.

I believe the production values are super. Define that as sound, transfer or  whatever technical aspect you wish, again in MY opinion all of the movies are great in this respect. I have owned all of these films in all of their prior release formats and this set tops them all. I took my other DVDs and donated them to various Veterans hospitals and homes who were thrilled to have them for our Veterans entertainment. I urge everyone to do this with all of their old media (and anything else) as there is a need by those  who care for our Vets for everything, even entertainment items.

Of course you can tell the movie's age by the ancient Hercules computer screens, but outside of that...wow!

If you love the movies this is a set you must have.  While there is some repetition of some segments as one goes through all the extras, it is not objectionable.

Some of the materials were in the regular DVD set released in 2003, but there is a lot of new material that has the copyright date of 2009, and is quite valuable for fans of the movies.

I have not yet tried the MU-TH-UR mode yet, since in watching some of the supplemental information, I really want to go back and re-watch the movies, as some things were brought out that I may have missed initially.  I need to guard against 'overload'.

The disc set comes in a nice book type packet, although the individual discs sometimes have to be dug out.  The Avatar Collector's Edition has a nicer arrangement for providing the discs.

This set is something that you will go back to over time, so keep it handy.

The original movie still sets a standard as simply being very scary.  And I have come to a better understanding and appreciation of Alien3.

1956434,5,B0000VCZK2,"I am not sure that when the first ""Alien"" movie was released in 1979 it never imagined that it would have the following that it has now in 2010. With 6 movies (including the 2 AvP movies) the fans get more and more eager for the next one to release.  This new set is just the thing that every fan needs as we eagerly await the new Ridley Scott Prequel that is in the works.  To have all of the 4 original Alien movies released in the Blu-Ray format is a dream come true.  The fact that they also released the Director's Cut of the 1st movie, the Special Editions of the other 3, and over 60 hours of special feautures makes this the most complete box set that any fan would ever want.

As many of you may already know, there are two major controversies surrounding this video release. The first revolves around the pricing of this item and unmitigated greed of the movie studio that issued it, and the second is an incompatibility issue with these DVDs and many players from 5 of the most prominent producers of Blu-Ray players in the world - in a word: unplayable

Because of the blatant over pricing of this product on the Amazon USA site and claims made by other reviewers that the UK release of this same item was not having the same incompatibility problems experienced here, I purchased this set from Amazon UK. In effect, at the time I made the purchase, I saved about $30.00, but there was a major catch that had not been clearly outlined - the cost of returns.

I have a Sony BDP-S570 Blu-ray Player, which I purchased new, less than 6 months ago, was from their current line, fairly high end, is running the most current firmware release, and is not listed by Amazon USA as one of the machines that should have a problem with this set of DVDs. However, I was unable to play any of the discs I received. When attempting to play these discs I would get to see the ""Blu-Ray Disclaimer"" screen and what I call the ""Hey look at us - we are the greatest movie studio in the world"" screen, and then nothing else, no matter how many buttons were pushed, cables switched or options tried or how many times the discs were inserted & removed or the equipment was powered off or restarted, including unplugging from the power supply.

I finally gave up and followed the Amazon UK return process, which allows for an item to be either returned for a replacement or a refund. Well, given the current incompatibility problems and my own experiences to that point, there was no way I was going to go the replacement route and risk wasting more time only to end up with another defective set of discs. So, I requested a refund. Here is where the catch comes in - irrespective of which choice one picks, the policy says it is up to the buyer to pay for the return of the item, and Amazon UK will reimburse the seller for those costs if they find that the problem with the item was a product defect or was damaged through initial shipping. I returned the DVD set in the same box I had received it, in pristine condition and using the same method used to ship it to me, the postal service. I used the least expensive rate offered by the USPS, and it still cost me $14.20 for the return. Amazon UK suggested the item be returned with insurance and tracking, but the USPS said that would require me to use First Class Mail, and the minimum cost for that would have been more than $35.00 (Luckily for me, I did not choose that route).

Nine days after mailing the set back, I received several emails from Amazon UK declaring that they had received the item, telling me they had issued me a refund, and giving me the details of that refund. Firstly, they did give me a full refund of the purchase price, which they broke down and said included their cost of $5.18 to ship the item to me. They then went on to tell me that they had issued me $2.08 refund to cover my shipping costs - that is over $12.00 less than what it had actually cost and even $3.10 less than what it had cost them to ship the same item to me, using their special bulk shipping rates. Basically, what this means is that I have wasted almost 3 weeks of my time to get and return a clearly defective item, no fault of my own, I have nothing to show for it and it has cost me more than $12.00 for the experience. Needless to say, it is highly unlikely that I will ever be purchasing anything else from Amazon UK given the risks involved. You can buy at your own risk!

Finally, come on Amazon, do you really expect us to swallow this huge pile of manure about the disc problem being just needing to upgrade the player's firmware. My player is not even on your list, it is already running the latest firmware and I have over 450 Blu-Ray discs but this one is the only one I am having a problem playing. Do you really expect me to believe that 5 major Blu-Ray player manufacturers are responsible for this problem, but the greedy, sleazy movie studio that produced this piece of crap is not responsible for anything. Are there other new major Blu-Ray releases from other studios having this same problem, to the extent that you are placing disclaimers on you site pages for them too? If this Blu-Ray set had been released by Microsoft, everyone would be shouting at the top of their lungs and pointing their fingers at Bill Gates. If this was a new car that would not run on the current gasoline, would you be asking all the major refiners to change their formulas so that this one new car could be sold and used?  There are standards in place for a reason - why are you ignoring them?

Greed is clearly alive and well in the 21st century. Can you say OINK? - OINK! OINK! OINK!",1290902400,17,5109,4.497844827586207

All I can say is I've been an Alien fan since I was kid and I've owned the movies on VHS, DVD, The Anthology on DVD set and now this on Blu-ray. The difference between DVD and Blu-ray has been discussed in depth already and that is the difference that I see. Clearer pictures in some parts, better audio in others. A huge load of extras with his Anthology. I got it on sale so I paid a fraction of the cost. I am more than happy with my purchase and I really don't see how anyone could make a ""better"" version.

1956438,4,B0000VCZK2,"So first and foremost a lot of older movies (read 80's and 90's) have had horrendous digital transfersto hi-def or HD. I was disappointed with the Terminator transfers to blu-ray (T1 and T2). But I digress. While the price for this boxed set may seem outrageous, fans of the first 2 films will be amazed with how clear the pictures are. Considering these movies are from 1979 (Alien) and 1986 (Aliens) the transfer is almost as if they were done more recently. That said the 2 movies are great and the picture quality of the latter 2 movies are also stellar. While I am not a fan of the latter 2 you are forced to buy them as a set if you want the HD experience.

Pros
*Awesome Picture
*Awesome Sound
*Alien
*Aliens

Cons
*Price
*Forced to buy the bundle
*Not all bonus features are in HD

If it weren't for the list price $140 this would be a 5 star review. As such, I was able to pick this up for $70 - while even though I felt that price was still high it was definitely worth it. The standard and extended versions of the films were included as well as bonus content and the making of featurette. This is a must-have for Alien franchise fans. I only wish these were sold separately, as I would have probably only picked up the first 2 in the franchise. 3.5+ stars for awesome picture quality and sound.

I ordered mine from the UK (Amazon UK)and saved $32 at the time(now still $12). Set arrived in 8 days and I was watching ALIEN (Ab-FAB!)last night on my SONY BDP-S370 with NO problems (latest firmware installed, 2gb USB plugged in, connected to internet). Load time was around 1 minute for each disc. The ""Disc Unbound"" feature worked as advertised and decreased the load times on subsequent discs to about 25 secs. All of the features, sound, and video worked flawlessly. I noticed no issues or problems that others have complained about on the US version. I did find the accordion-like disc holder to be a bit unruly, but the discs are kept nicely protected in the snap holders, unlike the US digi-book where they just slip in and out of the paper (increasing the chance of scratch damage).

MU-TH-ER mode looks amazing and I look forward to giving it and the 64hrs of bonus material a work out in the near future. ALIEN looked like I was watching it on release day in the theater(except better!). The Ridley intro was cool and made me anxious for the prequel to come.

This is Fox once again trying to screw us into buying the films in the franchise that sucked.  This price needs to be cut in half to be realistic, even the Back to the Future trilogy wasn't this much.  Plus, the transfers are grainy and poorly done, without any consultation to the directors of these films.

1956446,3,B0000VCZK2,"It's pretty much stuff that we've seen before in previous products like the Alien Quadrilogy that have been transferred to Blu-ray. If I rated it just for the movies, I'd give it somewhere between 3 and 3.5 stars. The background material that was included the Alien Quadrilogy is included in this release as well as some new material. But before you get your hopes up, most of it appears to have been filmed at the same time as the Quadrilogy, but never really made it into the featurettes. Still notably absent are the interviews with some of the people that got messed with by 20th Century Fox and Brandywine like David Fincher, but also absent are interviews with the central player, Walter Hill. So, it remains essentially an incomplete work.  Despite its limitations and the pro Fox and Brandywine spin, the featurettes together pretty much tell the story of how the Alien franchise arose from being a B movie script to a timeless Sci-Fi classic as a result of the rare synergy of different and unique talents and fell as a result of corporate greed and hubris. Of particular interest is the additional material where some of the principals ruminate about the possible future of the franchise which sounds like a giant ""I told you so"" to both the AVP movies and seriously calls into question the justification behind the making of Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection.

The only other thing I can say is the MUTH-UR mode is just daffy and annoying.  It's hard to read in some cases and frames the picture in a visually distracting manner when it's on.  And just like MUTH-UR, it is largely cryptic and unhelpful.",1289174400,2,1611,4.702127659574468

1956448,5,B0000VCZK2,"I was lucky enough to receive the new BluRay Alien Anthology as a gift and have been blown away by the initial viewing and features.  For those of you unfamiliar with the history of the Alien movies and their release onto viewable media, there have been several collections over the years, from laserdisc, to DVD, and to BluRay.  I, fortunately, have owned basically all of them and can tell you that this Anthology takes (almost) every feature and extra from the laserdiscs, Legacy DVDs, and Quadrilogy DVDs and presents them amazingly and fluidly.

The discs, presented in a great book-like box, have a reasonable loading time, but feature resume playback (thank you!) and a neat feature where you are able to switch discs without having to leave the menus and reload all the disclaimers etc.  This is such a time saver, as basically all my blurays have to be restarted, and do not feature resume.

The first movie looks and sounds phenomenal.  The transfer to HD is incredible in the detail but retains the grainy look at the same time.  The resolution is incredible as well, especially for a movie from 1979.  The transfer allows you to see every detail from the nasty film on the alien eggs to the details in the Nostromo.  I couldn't imagine a better viewing experience for such a movie.  Another great feature, brought from the Quadrilogy DVDs, is a little logo which you can have displayed during the deleted scenes when you choose to watch the director's cut rather than the theatrical cut.  The second film retains its distinctive look but like the first one has better resolution, colors, shadows, and a deep dark black.

The other two, while also HD, are more akin to their earlier DVD counterparts.

All in all, this is the collection for any Alien Fans.  I will still hold onto my Legacy and Quadrilogy DVDs, but this will be the one that I watch over and over.",1289174400,5,1875,4.676829268292683

Very afraid as to what Fox might do to these films (they are known as King of DNR)...not on this set! The DVD Quad box looked pretty good for DVD, but man! You have to experience these in hi-def! So, the price is steep (remember when the Quad box came out?) but it is well worth it!!! I actually got lost in the movie by the detail. If you are fan of the Alien films (all four) and love high definition, this set is for you! There is so much more to look at...don't even think DVD is 'good enough', rubbish!! You can't add to the picture what is not there. DVD is a dying format with titles like this being released! Thank you Fox for shutting us up with all the negative slack we have been given you. My only complaint is the way the discs are stored...the backs of these discs can easily be scratched if not careful when removing them (just don't man handle them).
I haven't even mentioned the sound...it too is awesome. You hear things that you never heard before.
Crank it up and enjoy. It's like watching these movies for the first time...I still have a smile on my face from the experience! This is the box set we have been waiting for. These movies are why 'blew-me-away' blu ray exists in the first place!!",1288310400,6,1356,4.280155642023346
1956460,5,B0000VCZK2,"Personally, I think 20th Century Fox knocked it out of the park on this DVD set! If you are a big fan of the Alien series this is thee DVD set to own!

All of the movies have been cleaned up and remastered for Blu-Ray so they all look incredibly crisp and clear but I noticed this more on the first two films, Alien and Aliens. The care and effort they took in cleaning up the films and bringing them to a whole new level was incredible! If you are one of those people that really notices the difference between standard DVD and Blu-Ray you will notice how much clearer the picture looks between the different formats!

If you already bought the Alien Quadrilogy [9 Pack] on standard DVD then the special features and extras will not surprise you because a majority of them are re-used from that set. BUT, if you're getting this for yourself, or even as a gift for another person, and they don't own any of the movies on DVD they are going to be BLOWN AWAY by all the special features, behind the scenes footage, deleted scenes ... all the extras are incredible!

So ... should you buy this? If you are a hardcore Alien fan or don't already own an Alien DVD collection ... ABSOLUTELY! However, if you already own the Alien Quadrilogy [9 Pack] DVD set then you'd basically be buying this set for the Blu-Ray, High Definition aspect.

My opinion is that the Blu-Ray REALLY sharpens and clears the movies up ... then again I can always notice the differences between standard and HD definition movies and television ... but if you don't or can't then this may not be the way to spend your money.

1956461,3,B0000VCZK2,"First off, I've been a long time fan of the entire series. I've migrated from VHS to DVD (Legacy), to more DVD (Quadrilogy) to BD (Anthology). The problem that I have is the compatibility of the BD's with both (!) my players. I own an Oppo BDP83 and a Philips BDP2500 BD player, both of them have huge problems viewing the discs. Often the discs don't play at all, they get stuck somewhere in the root menu. Or, they play the content in a kind of 25x zoom mode (which basicly restricts the viewing experience to seeing a lot of Ripley's hair f.i.).
With a little luck I can see a movie, after loading the disc a couple of times, then, at the main menu, choose a scene and then reverse to the beginning of the movie. Needless to say, I find this quite tedious and a waste of time (on average 10 to 15 minutes of fidgeting in order to see a movie). Of course I have upgraded to the latest firmware with both my players. I wonder how many people actually do firmware upgrades anyway, they just want a machine that plays discs!
My point is, why keep pushing BD software technology to the point where the hardware cannot really keep up? I would have gladly given up on all the menu stuff and the MU-TH-UR mode (whatever that is), just to get decent playback...",1288310400,4,1255,4.29957805907173

My solution was to jump to the scene selection area and start the film just after the intro and the titles, which worked.

My Oppo was about $500 and was highly reviewed. Also, I have all the latest firmware updates.  It is apparent that most of you do not have this problem, so maybe Oppo needs another update though I have a fairly large blu-ray collection and everything has played perfectly until I received this set.

Its the best restoration job to hi def ive ever seen of any movie on blu ray especially from a movie from the 70's which sets the bar very high for other companies, even considering the second two movies which were really great restorations just not as well as the first two. Which is really strange considering they were made in more recent times. The only one that has noticable differences that may irrate a little is the last movie resurrection. There are scenes where it like switches how it was restored the color may change and it may look a little less sharp and clear than other scenes, and some scenes there is too much noise but some scenes are really clear on clarity and it was a great job on those scenes. Overall it shows how blu ray should be for older movies the first alien and the second alien. Theres no excuse for doing a lesser job on older movies. This is a perfect example of what i mean. I could see every detail. All of the pours on everyones faces, all the lines on there chapped lips, the persperation looked so clear and real, everything is just beautiful. I could seriously see every detail in every scene. Things i wouldnt see in the dvd version. I actually did compare the dvd version of the film Alien to the blu ray version and there is an incredible difference. It looks completely new. Not to mention the sound is phenomonal. Its so realistic. It feels like your right there. The quality of the movie sound and picture is like it was made today recently thats how beautiful it is at least for the first two films overall the second two films there are scenes like that where its like it was made recently but its not constant. At least thats what i noticed but its still very well done. Not to mention the endless extra features. Which captures every aspect of the movie. Interviews with the original crew, behind the scenes, commentaries so much more which is 65 hours worth. Its not incredibly expensive considering what your getting which is two versions of all four movies beautifully remastered in hi def with lots of commentaries, endless extra features the making of each movie plus loads more. Its definitely well worth it, its a must have and in my opinion is not that expensive. For those who complain about the price and that you already have these movies on there releases in VHS and dvd so why get the blu ray, the truth is these movies are beautifully restored and remastered for hi def making it 100 percent better than the dvd version not to mention the fact you get every special feature from all previous releases these movies are the best they have ever looked making it a must have and well worth the price. So if you have an HDTV and a blu ray player of course this is a must have. As for the actual movies in my opinion the first three movies are the absolute best, a must have. They have the best stories, and the way the first three movies were put the together make them the best. The graphics are the best on the first two and not far behind that on the third however some scenes are obviously fake like when the alien runs but that has nothing to do with restoration. The fourth movie, resurrection, is also really good its a really good story line except there are some parts which i found stupid maybe even kinda corny as far as dialogue goes but its a really great story that continues the collection but it doesnt compare to the first three. It isn't horrible or even just okay though also. Its a really good movie in my opinion just not as good as the first three which in my opinion were the best by far.",1288224000,3,3626,4.397321428571429
1956464,5,B0000VCZK2,"Others have said it and I will reiterate it here.  The discs are packed VERY securely in book form in this set.  They require more than a little effort to extract them from their nesting places.  I for one would not have considered the use of a more traditional disc storage system to be in any way a lesser value in either aesthetics or quality.  Truth be told, I am strongly considering buying one of those multi-disc or 6-disc cases available from online sellers and keeping my anthology Blu-ray discs in those simply for ease of repeat access.

Once you get them out, however, hold on to something because you are in for a long and exhaustive ride through the ""Alien"" universe.  There is so much content that one could feasibly collapse from exhaustion if one tried to take it all in as rapidly as possible.  And how enjoyable would that really be, eh?

Picture and sound quality for all the movies exceeds any and all previous release versions and formats, in some cases by a country mile. And if the only way you ever saw these movies was on VHS or TV, you really haven't seen them yet.  Chances are that most people who bought the DVD set ""Alien Quadrilogy"" (the entire contents of which are reproduced here and often improved upon) back when it was released in 2003 did NOT have a high-definition TV at the time.  Those TV's were still fairly new and VERY expensive back then.  Nowadays, a great many of us own the hi-def TVs that are today an essential part of the new Blu-ray ""Alien Anthology"" viewing experience.  You can now watch the same content as before except in substantially better video/audio presentation and on a TV screen that embraces and serves the newer, higher technology.

In the first film, ""Alien"", I did notice that while the visual detail inside the ship is much greater, certain scenes seem a bit darker and the detail is more difficult to see than in other DVD versions.  In particular, Kane's descent into the cave, exterior shots of the Nostromo, and the attack on Brett are all a bit darker.  I can not tell you if it matches with the original release (and later DVD versions had the brightness tweaked a bit) or if something else is to blame.

But moving on:  In case you missed the memo, there is a truckload of new stuff in this anthology that was NOT included (or even yet produced) in the Quadrilogy.  Even more content, better technological presentation, and (for many of us) finally on the hi-def screen we wish we had seven years earlier.  You are a winner on every front.

My only other complaint is about the size of the text in some of the special features menus.  It is very, very tiny.  I have a 32-inch screen and the text appears so tiny on it I have to literally put my face up to the screen to read it.  But that is not unique to this Blu-ray set.  I've seen it on other Blu-rays too, such as ""District 9"".  I have no idea how this micro-text trend started or why.

And not to sound petty, but in some portions of the bonus content there are pages with text describing the pictures or slideshows you can watch, and they include some minor punctuation errors and syntax issues.  Not everyone will notice or care, but I did and do.  It just looks a little unprofessional, IMHO.  If ""unprofessional"" is too harsh a description, I'll offer ""less than perfect"" instead.  Again, these are minor points and are probably of little or no consequence to most viewers.  But now that I've spotted the errors, I will think of them every time I think of the product.

And in the bonus content for ""Aliens"" you can learn the first and middle names of the Nostromo crew in the bios generated for that movie's boardroom scene (as seen on a screen behind Ripley).  Lots of detail is thrown in, including the individual crew members' birthdate, education, training, and service records.  The writing style in the bios makes me cringe just a bit, but I'm a little oversensitive about that kind of thing.  And the photos of the crew members look like movie studio publicity shots instead of worker I.D. photos (guess why?), but maybe I'm being too picky.  You decide.

[End of nitpicky rant about an otherwise stellar product.]

Thinking about giving this as a gift this holiday season?  Give it to a young person because one will need quite a bit of time to watch, read, and experience every last bit of this ""working vacation in a box"".  The task of watching the whole thing seems so massive it makes my head hurt a little to think about it.  Ridley Scott's promised prequel will probably be in the theaters before I can finish this ""Alien"" marathon.

Is it a good value for your money?  In terms of volume of content, absolutely.  I can't think of a movie or movie series that has been as extensively chronicled and augmented for home video format as this one.  If the high price unnerves you a bit, consider it a very small price to pay considering how much legwork and how many man hours went into producing the set, and that you didn't have to lift a finger to help.  Hee hee!

Will the price eventually drop a bit?  Maybe, but probably not any time soon.  You will probably be able to get a discounted used copy soon enough but it would devalue the project and product as a whole if the new copies were marked down by the studio any time in the foreseeable future.  Hope for it, but don't count on it.

Wish you could just buy one or two of the movies in Blu-ray format and not have to pay for the ones that aren't your favorites?  There is every reason to believe that the individual films (or more likely just the first two) will SOMEDAY be released for separate purchase.  But given the way the bonus content is tied into the set as a whole I suspect you would not get this proportion of it in an individual release, though that may or may not be important to you down the road.  For the set to REALLY stand up over time, the bonus content has to be enjoyable enough to merit repeat viewings, and much of it is.  I suspect that the first wave of eventual single-film Blu-ray releases will have only a tiny fraction of the film-specific content available here.

For the more casual fans of the ""Alien"" series, you may be inclined to wait for the single-film releases anyway.  There certainly would be a demand for those and no doubt the suits at Fox have anticipated it.  But they also want to get the appropriate amount of shelf life and reputation out of this new multi-disc set.  So once again for you patient hold-outs out there, hope for it but don't hold your breath.

One only hopes that the massive amount of content here doesn't amount to ""Alien"" overload and make us too weary of the saga and its elements to get excited for Ridley Scott's planned prequel (which as of this writing looks like it is tentatively moving forward but not without some stumbling blocks).

Finally, a little history and perspective on the price ---  Back in the early and mid 90's, long before Special Edition DVDs were ubiquitous, a small but devoted and merry band of us videophiles owned laserdisc players and cheered about the advantages of the laserdisc's presentation quality advantage over VHS.  Twentieth Century Fox released Special Edition laserdisc collector's sets of both ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"", and we collectors had to shell out about a hundred bucks per movie for those.  They were chock full of bonus content and had vastly superior picture and sound for the day, but we sure paid through the nose to find out.

Just a few years later we could get on a single DVD and for about twenty bucks what we paid five times that for earlier, and that was to get 3 or 4 large discs that still couldn't offer us uninterrupted playback of the movies.  This new ""Alien Anthology"" Blu-ray set is selling for less than we paid for the laserdisc collector's sets 15-17 years ago, offers about ten times the bonus content, looks and sounds infinitely better, and does not for ONE MINUTE make us regret the double-dip purchase (or by now, the quadruple- or quintuple-dip, considering the numerous release formats).  If anyone has the right to grumble about the price, it is us.  But we won't.  We're definitely trading up.

The ""Alien Anthology"" is the new standard for content volume, value, and for the time, love, and care that went into its production.  Putting this set together took years and a heck of a lot of work.  It is award-worthy.

And as in life, timing is everything.  I pre-ordered this set and it arrived at my house on the release date.  Within a day, Amazon offered it in a combo deal with Michael Mann's ""Last of the Mohicans"" Blu-ray for the exact price I paid for the pre-order.  Darn the luck!",1288224000,71,8643,4.513513513513513
1956465,4,B0000VCZK2,Just wanted to say this set is an excellent upgrade over the previous dvd set. Sound is very well done. Don't expect crystal clear picture on aliens. You do get noticiable grain thoughout the movie. I do notice some scenes that have dirt specs cleaned up in aliens which is an excellent plus. The quality of the other alien movies from picture and sound of what I have seen are excellent. If I had to watch the Aliens movies this is the way to enjoy them. As for the packaging. Its good blu ray discs don't scratch. If this was standarf dvd's people would be having a lot of scratching and disc problems. The discs in this set are packaged on cardboard backing. Why could they not package this set like they did with Blade Runner. That's the only reason I have dropped a star is for the packaging Fox elected to use. It is also slightly a fight to get the book style packaging out of the case.,1288224000,3,893,4.289940828402367
1956466,4,B0000VCZK2,"I agree with the two big reviews here that the transfers are stunning, especially Alien.

As mentioned, the packaging, while beautiful, is poor functionally. I can't get the darned discs out of their slots! I have to wedge a piece of cardboard under them to lift up an edge to grab.

Finally, the documentaries are NOT in hi-def, even the parts filmed just a few years ago. This is disappointing, and not mentioned anywhere on the packaging or description.",1288224000,,456,4.7594936708860756
1956467,1,B0000VCZK2,"Having just received this box set from UPS, I popped it into the player to check out the various titles. All of the original, theatrical versions play and look great. The newer versions, on the other hand, such as the Director's Cut of Alien, the Extended Cut of Aliens, etc., look like the picture has been horribly zoomed in and placed off center, with huge black bars showing on-screen (in the Director's Cut, the top third of the screen is a black bar, in Aliens' Extended Cut, the right quarter of the screen was a black bar).

I'm sending back in hopes of just having received bad copies. I'll update this review and re-rate it after having received replacement discs. But as it stands, I'll only give 1 star for this sort of low quality product.",1288137600,15,752,4.529411764705882
1956468,2,B0000VCZK2,"Sadly, I have to agree with some other folk on this -- way too expensive. I've got the Quadrilogy on DVD already, and I was THRILLED to pick it up don't get me wrong. But I'd like to see them do something similar to an offer that Disney made for their DVD-to-BluRay customers: get some money back with proof of purchase via a manufacturer coupon. I don't want to pay for copy protection and other 'features' that have no benefits to me as a paying customer. Don't try and play that game with me, and don't tell me you couldn't somehow just negotiate the same fees for the staff and stars you did for the previous boxset. Come on guys, the lower the price, the more you sell. It's a simple equation.",1288137600,4,698,4.295454545454546
1956469,5,B0000VCZK2,"NOTE: Some Sony, Oppo, Panasonic and Samsung players may have a problem with the Disc Unbound or Mother Mode settings with this set. I would suggest making sure you have the latest firmware prior to playing these.

Not counting the individual title releases (or VHS), this is the third go round for the ""Aliens"" films on disc but first on Blu-ray. After all of that experience you'd expect Fox to turn out a perfect product. While not exactly perhaps, it's very very close.

The first two films ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" receive top notch brand new HD transfers. A lot of folks were afraid that these films would turn out looking like the recent reissue of ""Predator"" with the overuse of digital noise reduction which actually REDUCES fine detail in pursuit of reducing grain. The grain management used here is subtle and improves the image quality.

Both the original theatrical version of ""Alien"" and the ""Extended Cut"" from 2003 look exceptionally good here. There are some minor variations in some of the material due to some minor differences in color timing from what I can tell but overall both versions look amazingly consistent with a richer, darker image but plenty of detail reflecting an experience closer to the theatrical showing for the original film.

""Aliens"" always the film with the most grain (which James Cameron didn't like at the time but they were working with a new type of film stock)doesn't lose its film-like look, retains much of its grain but looks the best it ever has on home video. Each disc features seamless branched editions of the original theatrical versions and the extended cuts. For ""Aliens"" the two versions look slightly different at times (to my eyes) but are surprisingly consistent given the source material.

""Alien 3"" and ""Alien Resurrection"" both look quite good although they are clearly from older HD masters with a bit more heavy handed use of DNR and detail not quite as sharp. Still, both look very good indeed and are a step up compared to the original DVDs. There was also some redubbing of dialogue for a couple of scenes for ""Alien 3"" with the original cast brought back in to provide clearer sound compared to the production sound on the ""Workprint"" version.

We get both the original theatrical cuts and extended editons prepared in 2003.

Folks who purchased the previous set will enjoy the fact that all of the extras from the previous editions have been ported over (at least I couldn't find any missing off the top of my head). Unfortuantely the new commentary tracks that star Sigorney Weaver was supposed to record didn't happen for reasons of logicistics. Likewise missing (at the request of James Cameron's Lightstorm)is the originally promised outtakes which featured actor James Remar in the role of Hicks. That's unfortunate but not a deal breaker.

We get isolated scores, commentary tracks, behind-the-scenes footage, interviews new and old and the uncut documentary made on the debacle that occurred with ""Alien 3"" (the previous version was edited due to some negative comments about Fox).

The Bad: The packaging while innovative in design and handsome looking isn't the best place to store these discs. Housed in a hardback Blu-ray sized case, the films come in a heavy cardboard book with spots to slip the discs in and out. The only concern I would have is wear and tear and possible scratching although it should be noted that generally Blu-ray can withstand more wear and tear than normal DVDs. I personally would have preferred the option of purchasing this in a standard Blu-ray case with a booklet featuring the photos inside the hardback book.

There is also a small booklet detailing the contents of the discs and how to navigate the interactive features. There is a really cool new interactive feature which allows you as you go from one disc to the next to skip all the annoying FBI and logos that act as introductions to the discs taking you directly to the feature film or special features. It's a nice innovative touch that ALL studios should apply to their Blu-ray boxed sets. When you take the disc out and are loading the next disc in the logo of the ""Company"" that is also a character in the films stays on your screen.

Over all this is an outstanding set and worth the upgrade for fans of the films who want these in high def. Is this upgrade worthwhile? That will depend on you and how important these films and new extras are to you. I realize that there are those that are upset with the price on these and the best I can suggest is to buy it while it is low priced or wait until they come down in price during the Christmas season.

The US version comes with disc's in a cardboard sleeve. It looks nice and all... But, here is the thing. 1 of my discs is badly scratched when I took it out to look at it. Given the angle that these discs slide in and out they wear on the cardboard sleeve. I would recommend getting some cases for your discs unless you do not plan on watching these movies 3+ times a year.

I studied American short stories in college and this story-characters-setting really came to a frightening reality.  This film can NOT be missed by anyone who is a fan of great sci-fi.  For those of you who did not like ""Alien"", you probably like the rubber suited Godzilla or think Mighty Mouse could put up a good fight with Superman (even tho you know Mighty Mouse is a cartoon and Superman is a real man).  ""Aliens"" definitely had more action.  The first VHS release was disjointed by their editing, but the first DVD release added 18 deleted minutes which made the movie better.  I hope it is the the same in Blu-ray as I have not yet played it.  3 & 4 were OK, and I hope they made lots of money, but the effects were gone, and the frightening scenes were rather tame.

1956474,5,B0000VCZK2,"The ""Alien Anthology"" may have taken some time to come to Blu-ray Disc, but it has been worth the wait.  We received the set directly from Fox so are able to give readers an early sneak peek.  The films themselves are presented in both their theatrical versions and extended ""special edition"" versions, Even Alien3 comes in a half-hour longer version here, and they've gone to the trouble of re-recording bits of dialog and sound effects to clean up the audio from the restored portion to match the rest of the film.  It is nice to have the choice to watch either cut of all four movies, and the SE version of the second film really adds depth to the story and the characters making a great film even better.

Each film gets the DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 treatment (the first two films' theatrical cuts are also available in Dolby Digital 2.0 and 4.1 channel mixes).  Sound is excellent overall, though perhaps not quite as bombastic as one might expect from such action-heavy titles.  It seems like more should be coming from behind us at times, and the low bass rumble of the weapon fire and explosions is lacking ever so slightly in deep extended bass.  But these are fairly minor criticisms as the sound is clean, imaging is precise, and dialog is clear and articulate throughout.  The video transfers are clearly superior to the DVDs that came before them with rich detail, nicely saturated colors and deep blacks.  H.R. Geiger's creepy organic art on the derelict alien ship in the first film has never looked so detailed and powerful and you can practically count the pores on young Sigourney Weaver's face.  There are still minor instances of murky blacks, some ringing and softness here and there due to mild use of noise reduction, but overall, the transfers are pristine, considering the age of the films.  The first two films, though the earliest, look the most improved here - no surprise considering they have been painstakingly remastered at 4K resolution for this release.  Only ""Aliens"" is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1 - nearly filling a standard 16:9 screen with thin black lines at the top and bottom.  The rest of the films are presented in a CinemaScope 2.35:1 aspect.

The extras are extensive, to say the least (be prepared to spend some time here), with special features available on each disc, plus two entire Blu-ray Discs packed full of additional extras: one with ""Making Of"" documentaries, interview segments and behind-the-scenes footage, and one disc featuring the ""Archives,"" chock full of seemingly every last piece of material -- text, still photos and video -- supporting the films and their back story.  A helpful ""MU-TH-UR"" mode (with its own tutorial) is included to help you navigate through the massive amount of supplements - even allowing us to go directly to specific chapters on other discs: just eject one and insert the other, and it will take you directly to the requested material.  Pop the original disc back in and the player will remember where you left off, asking if you'd like to resume.  A nice feature made possible via BD-Java.

At least one commentary track is available for each film (""Alien"" has two), with every director but David Fincher (Alien3) participating in the commentary fun.  All four films also have isolated score tracks (in Dolby Digital 5.1), so you can appreciate the nuances of the film's scores without any distracting dialog or sound effects. Although much of the supplementary materials used here are re-purposed from earlier home video releases (DVD and laserdisc), we found many new and extended interview segments and snippets we'd never seen before.  I'm sure die-hard fans will find hours of enjoyment in the set, and the audio and video quality alone is worth the upgrade.  I know I can never go back to the DVDs.  Highly recommended!

UPDATE (10/24): Some early purchasers and reviewers have noted some compatibility issues with the set and certain hardware.  We've tested the disc with twelve players so far (OPPO, Panasonic, Samsung, LG, Philips, Toshiba and Sony), with mostly minor compatibility issues noted.  On the OPPO BDP-83, the ""Director's Cut"" of ""Alien"" begins playing zoomed in with only the top left corner of the image visible.  Hitting ""Menu"" then ""Play"" restores the image to its proper size.  Also a Samsung BC-C6900 plays Ridley Scott's intro video to the Director's Cut of ""Alien"" squished to 4:3 (should be 16:9).  Similarly a Philips BD-P7200 played the Ridley intro in a tiny window at the top of the screen, but the film itself played fine in both versions.  But otherwise every player we've tested seems to play the set without issues.  Some players are extremely slow to load the disc (particularly older players), but this is to be expected from such a BD-Java-heavy title.  BD-Java can use quite a bit of on-board memory and processing power once you get fancy (and boy are these discs fancy!).  We've tested the set on the following players: Panasonic DMP-BDT350, DMP-BD85, DMP-BD60, DMP-BD70V and DMP-BD35, Samsung BD-C6900, LG BD390, OPPO BDP-83, Sony PS3, Sony BDP-S350, Philips BD-P7200 and Toshiba BDX3000.

While it's not uncommon to see NEW Blu-Ray movies offered at a $35srp per movie I would think 4 OLD movies regardless of the bells & whistles would be bundled together at no more than $100 or even $120srp. $140srp is too much regardless of Amazon's discounts.

I have been upgrading my standard DVDs to Blu-Rays but have been patiently (and rather quickly) doing it at $10-15 each then trading in my DVDs for credit or selling them for $2-5 each bringing down my price even more.

At first I thought the street date had been changed at the last minute (it wouldn't be the first time).  But it appears that all the websites still list the release date for next Tuesday (Oct 26), so I guess my local store must have made a mistake (it wouldn't be the first time for that either).
 In either case, I already got my hands on the Alien Anthology set, and I thought that Alien fans who are still trying to decide whether it's worth the upgrade before next week's proper street date might want to know the following:

1) All four films look very good on bluray, and much better than the earlier DVDs, with the first two films looking the best.  Alien almost looks brand new.  Aliens still looks its age (sometimes), but it enjoys the single biggest improvement in picture quality in the jump from DVD to bluray that I have ever seen for a classic film (or pretty much any film for that matter).  While there are still plenty of shots that still look soft or a bit grainy by today's standards, the entire film looks sharper than ever and the grain is far less distracting.  Some sequences, like the marines' initial investigation of the abandoned colony, almost look like they could have been shot this year.  The color quality and detail visible on the panning shot from the planet to Ripley's orbital hospital room at the beginning of the film totally blew my mind. Detail and texture are excellent throughout and I saw no signs that DNR had been overused.  After experiencing Aliens on bluray, I wonder how I was ever able to tolerate the picture quality on the DVD.
[UPDATE:  The Theatrical and Director's cuts of Alien both look equally great.  It's my understanding that Ridley Scott made some minor alterations to things like contrast, etc. in the Director's cut, but I frankly didn't notice any difference between the two.  I haven't watched the Theatrical cut of Aliens in years, as I much prefer the Extended version, so I may not remember which all scenes were added for the latter.  However, I did not notice any correlation between picture quality and whether a scene was in the Theatrical cut or added in later, so I assume that they all come from the same source and are of more-or-less equal quality.  If I have a chance to look at it again soon and do notice any differences, I'll post another update.]
[UPDATE 2:  I've watched the first 25 minutes of the Theatrical cut of Aliens and can confirm that the picture quality is identical to the Special Edition.  In other words, it will cause longtime Aliens fans' jaws to drop off right before they become temporarily blinded by its awe-inspiring glory.  This is truly the greatest film restoration I've ever seen prepared for the transition from DVD to bluray.  Because of the film stock used, I didn't think it would ever be possible for the film to look this good.]

 2) All four films also sound greatly improved compared to the DVD.  This is especially true for Alien 3.  Dialogue which was hard to make out on the DVD is now much clearer and easier to understand.  I did notice some audio sync issues with some of the third film's dialogue, but I think these are misalignments which were already present on previous DVD releases, and may therefore be inherent to the original film.

 3) The new extras are extensive and excellent.  Within the first couple minutes of sampling the new enhancement pods on disc 5, I learned a couple of tidbits I had been unaware of before.  These are a wonderful extension of the already superb making-of documentaries.  The MU-TH-UR interactive mode is easy to use and will probably prove helpful to those who are only interested in seeing certain parts of the behind-the-scenes material, but I haven't used it much.  I've only sampled a couple minutes of the trivia track portion of this feature (titled ""Datastream""), but so far it appears as though it will mostly be a re-hash of material you can find in disc 5's documentaries.  The set also includes ALL of the extras from EVERY previous release of these films, as promised (at least as far as I can tell), in addition to the extended Alien Evolution and Alien 3 documentaries.
[UPDATE:  The extended Alien 3 documentary includes significantly more footage of Fincher directing on the set (lenghtier character discussions with the actors, etc.) and more detail on the schism between him and the studio that I don't remember seeing on the Quadrilogy DVD.  At one point during filming you see Fincher get on a microphone and say, ""I can't believe Fox is the number one studio because they're all such a bunch of morons.""  Interestingly, while some of the new footage does reflect poorly on the studio, I think it also makes it easier to understand why some people had trouble working with Fincher.  I personally find this longer cut much more interesting, but it hardly feels like an entirely new, revelatory version.  Still, if you love a good behind-the-scenes documentary, the extended cut of ""Wreckage and Rage: The Making of Alien 3"" may help justify the upgrade to bluray.
  By my estimate, disc 5 contains around 17 hours of documentaries, including an hour to an hour-and-a-half of new enhancement pods for each individual film (these are mostly extended interviews and production footage).  I couldn't even tell you how many hours of content are on disc 6.  So it's understandable, due to space limitations, that some of this material still appears to be in standard def.  Although it's in SD, most of it has been enhanced so your bluray player will upconvert it (sometimes beautifully so) to fill a widescreen TV.  I find the text slides on the still galleries of concept art on disc 6 (which ARE in FULL HD) much easier to read now.  In disc 5's docs, most film clips, production artwork and photos, and many interviews will now fill the screen, while other interview clips appear pillarboxed with new imagery to the right and left instead of black bars (similar to the ""Disneyview"" feature on the Snow White and Pinocchio blurays, though mostly much less distracting than those were).  It all looks good enough that I don't think many people will be too disappointed that some of these extras are still in SD.
  BOTTOM LINE: The extras, both new and old, are a substantial improvement over the Quadrilogy DVD set (at least IMHO, your mileage may vary).  I doubt many people will feel shortchanged here.]
[UPDATE 6:  I've found more new extras on disc 6.  There are some deleted scenes from Aliens, at least one of which - featuring Burke in a cocoon - I don't think I've seen before.  The Patch and Logos image gallery will be appreciated by folks who love all the costuming/set dressing details.  There's a video reproduction of a ride called ""Aliens: Ride At The Speed of Fright"" which is notable for two things: it's REALLY cheesy, and it features a very young Jeffrey Combs (I think this part is new - I don't remember seeing it on the DVD).  The Parodies section is just some Alien-related clips from Spaceballs and Family Guy.  You'll also want to keep an eye out for Easter Eggs on this disc.]

 4) The set has a couple of impressive surprises that weren't mentioned in any of the studio press releases I've seen.  Disc Unbound is an automatic feature: when you eject any disc from this set, the Weyland-Yutani logo will pop up on screen.  You can then insert any other disc from the set and you'll go straight to the main menu - it will skip over all the studio logos and FBI Warning screens, making an Alien marathon slightly faster and less annoying.
  I was aware that this set would include isolated score tracks for all four films (as well as alternate score tracks for the first two), but was unaware that you can also access each piece of music in any order from an index which includes even more unused music.  I'm not certain, but I think I may have even spotted a couple of Bonus alternate tracks for Aliens that weren't even on the Deluxe Edition soundtrack CD.

5) For those who are hard of hearing, all 4 films and even the extras on discs 5 and 6 include subtitles in around 15 languages, including English and Spanish.  Even the audio commentaries have subtitles in multiple languages!  Each film also has multiple language audio tracks, though it appears that only the English receives a lossless one.

 6) The packaging is the most elegantly beautiful I've ever seen for a bluray set.  Inside the slipcase is a hardcover book with each disc held securely within its own page.  These pages include photos from each film, as well as some basic info like plot synopses and director's credits.  There's also a booklet and insert tucked in the back which explain how MU-TH-UR mode and Disc Unbound work, and list the content on each disc.  It also has a note from Ridley Scott filled with tantalizing hints about what to expect in his upcoming prequel.  Everyone will be happy to know that the package is very compact and will fit perfectly next to your other blurays.  It's the same size as the Close Encounters of the Third Kind bluray, except that the spine is a little thicker since it holds more discs.
  The menu screens are also beautifully designed.  The menu for each film features a Weyland-Yutani computer interface with a continuous stream of 3D diagrams and info on various vehicles, weapons, and creatures from each film.  It also shows a spacechart indicating the name and location of the planet where each film takes place.  Many fans will want to watch the menus play a few times just to take in all the information and detail.  The menus are also quick and easy to navigate, and most video features on discs 5 and 6 include a ""Play All"" option.  On disc 5, for example, you can either play all segments of the documentray for each film separately, or you can simply choose to play all 4 documentaries at once.

As beautiful as the packaging is, it does have a couple of minor problems, which brings me to...

CONS:
1)  The 3rd and 4th films don't look quite as spectacular as the first two.  They still look far better than the DVDs, and I think the vast majority of people will be perfectly pleased with them.  For example, the underwater sequence in Resurrection looks more beautiful than ever.  In the shot where the alien drags the docking pilot back into the flooded kitchen, I could now clearly see a single hair floating across the foreground, a detail I had never noticed before during the dozens of times I had watched this movie on DVD.  The text of the electronic Bible from the extended chapel scene is also much easier to read now.  Nevertheless, you can tell that slightly less work went into the last two films, and some of the hardcore videophiles may be very slightly disappointed by the results after they see how magnificent the first two films now look.

[UPDATE:  In my honest opinion, Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection only look less impressive in comparison to the first two films.  I didn't notice any signs of DNR or any other technical issues at all. It's my understanding that the first, third and fourth films each had new HD remasters done for the 2003 Quadrilogy DVD set.  (If I recall correctly, I think that James Cameron chose not to do a new remaster of Aliens at that time because he felt the one they had was already about as good as they could make the movie look with the technology available circa 2003 - this is probably again due to the film stock they shot Aliens on.)
Skip ahead 7 years to today.  Now Alien has been given ANOTHER NEW HD remaster using the most up-to-date technology, and it looks outstanding.  Not only does it ALMOST look, for the most part, like a film that could have been shot in 2010, I think the picture quality on the bluray is often as sharp or sharper and better-looking than some films that really did come out this year (like Predators).  It's also nearly comparable to, at times dare I say maybe even better than the picture quality on Ridley Scott's Robin Hood, in my opinion (at least when you take Alien's age into consideration).  Aliens has also received a brand NEW HD remaster - probably its first in over a decade.  I was too young to see it in the theater, but I imagine Cameron is probably telling the truth when he claims that it looks better than it originally did in the theater.  I didn't believe it could ever look as good as it does on bluray because of how bad it looked on DVD and because of what Cameron and others have said about the weaknesses of the film they shot it on.
Alien 3 and Resurrection, it's my understanding, have NOT received NEW HD remasters circa 2010.  So basically, this is the first time that you're seeing the full quality of the HD remasters that were done for the 2003 Quadrilogy set (which obviously could not show them in HD).  They still look very good, and much better than the DVD.  Sometimes they have better detail and look sharper than Alien and Aliens do, but technologies for film restoration have obviously improved a great deal in 7 years, and for the most part I think that the first two films now look better (i.e. sharper, etc.) than the last two, at least with regard to expectation.  Think of it this way: we typically expect newer movies to look better on bluray than older ones do.  So when you see how near-perfect (excellent detail, depth, contrast, deep blacks, no distracting grain, etc.) Alien now looks, then see how the picture quality on Aliens (while certainly not ""perfect"") far exceeds anything you would expect for a film photographed on such problematic material, you then expect the picture quality on the last two films to knock it out of the ballpark and surprise you to an equal or greater degree.  Since they don't SURPRISE you (they only look NEARLY Just As GOOD as the first two films - even though their remasters were done 7 years ago, they were still done very well), many people who actually understand a bit about film restoration will clearly see a difference and wish Fox had spent the money to do a more recent 2010 remaster of the last two films as well, so they would look EVERY BIT As Good or better than the first two films, as we would expect them to.  Meanwhile, I think that most people in a more general audience will only see a difference in comparison to the first two films, if they see any difference in the picture quality at all.  Many (maybe not all) of those people will probably be completely satisfied with the fact that all 4 movies look far, FAR better than they did on DVD.
Of course, it's possible I'm misinformed and that further restoration was done more recently on the last two films, and just wasn't as extensive as that done on the first two.  But either way, the end effect is the same.  In other words, you'll look at Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection and say, ""These look really good, way better than the DVD.""  You won't have the same reaction to them that you'll probably have to the first two movies, which is, ""HOLY C%@P!!!!  HOW DID THEY MAKE MOVIES THIS OLD LOOK THIS GOOD!!!  AND HOW DID I EVER MANAGE TO WATCH THE SECOND MOVIE ON DVD WHEN IT COULD HAVE LOOKED THIS MUCH BETTER??!!!!!""]

 2) The packaging requires you to slide the discs sideways out from their pages.  While the discs are held quite securely, I found that they are very easy to pull out after a little practice.  As long as you're careful I don't think there's much need to worry about damaging the discs.  Another issue is how tightly the book holding the discs fits into the outer slipcover.  The best way to get it out is to hold the set on its side and gently shake it a couple of times till you can grab the book's edge and pull it the rest of the way out.  Personally, I don't find these issues all that bothersome, but I know some people will probably find it more frustrating.  Those who dislike non-standard book-style packaging may want to wait for the individual releases of each film in the hopes that they'll have more standard packaging.
  (NOTE:  Anyone who wants to bypass the issue of removing the outer slipcase after you open the set for the first time could just set the book containing the discs, minus outer slipcase, on the shelf with their other blurays - the packaging seems pretty sturdy and I think the discs would still be well-protected.)
  (NOTE:  The Alien Anthology booklet does not replicate all of the text from the booklet included in the Quadrilogy DVD set, so obsessive completists may want to remove the Quadrilogy booklet if you're going to sell or give away your DVDs.  Unfortunately, the Quadrilogy booklet is too large to fit inside the bluray package.)

THE BOTTOM LINE:
  If you don't want all four movies, are allergic to non-standard packaging, or just can't afford the steep price tag, you may want to wait for the inevitable but as-yet-unannounced individual bluray releases.  (Just keep in mind that the extras for all four films have been condensed onto 2 bluray discs for this set.  At this point in time there's no way to know whether you'll get all of the new extras if you wait for the individual releases.)  Otherwise, this set is an absolute must-have.  While the last two films don't look quite as good as the first two, they still look pretty great, and this set has exceeded all of my other expectations (which were very high).  The picture quality on Aliens especially knocked my socks off.  The new extras are substantial, and the quality of the entire presentation sets a new standard for future bluray releases.  As a lifelong fan of these films I felt like the Alien Quadrilogy DVD set was a dream-come-true.  The Alien Anthology bluray set makes me feel like all my dreams were inadequate.

 Just to be clear, I am not associated in any way with any Hollywood studio or any newspaper, magazine or website which reviews films or DVDs/blurays.  I've never written a product review before, and am only doing so now because I appear to have gotten this item early.  I'm just a lover of movies, blurays, and the Alien franchise who got extremely lucky and got the set a week early thanks to my local retailer.",1287619200,"1,340",18752,4.603131586871425

So why is this set $95 dollars?

Because it is a new movie and they are attempting to recoup their investment?
No, all have been out forever and are quite profitable.

Because the blu-ray technology costs so much?
No, I have bought several great movies (that looked great too) right here on Amazon for only $10.
The first Terminator
V for Vendetta
The Usual Suspects
All great movies and all $10

Because of all the extras?
No, we'll all look at them once, but we really just want to watch the movies.

Because they think that we are fanboys that will buy it at any price.
Obviously, otherwise this would be priced more reasonably or the movies would be sold individually.

We all want the first teo movies, we would like to have the second two. the extra features are great, but aren't they supposed to be extras. This set is charging a ton for those extras.

This isn't the only set like this (I'm talking about you Magnificent Seven) and although it kills me not to have some of these in blu-ray I guess I will have to do with my DVD versions for now.

Sell these at a reasonable price and I'll buy them. (Back to the Future...three movies with extras $45 and digital file) Try to hijack my memories and get me to pay twice what they should and I won't.",1287360000,32,1354,4.324110671936759
1956479,3,B0000VCZK2,"Well being that i usually have other means of getting movies, cough, i still have been waiting for this to come out in high def for a long time. But to be honest with you i think most people are right when they says just release them separately or lower the price. Also i can say that yes a lot of the movies don't get the attention they deserve when it comes to blu ray transfer. The Alien movies are great, that is the first two. Alien is classic and should be a masterpiece to view on blu-ray, Aliens is even more of a masterpiece and deserves the best quality that Blu-ray has to offer. Will it get it? Hopefully, but not likely. A lot of things depend on your blu-ray player, your HDTV, and a few other small deciding factors. I for one use my PS3 which is still one of the best players on the market, also i will say that there are a few other brands out there that are great as well. That being said i will not shell out 100$(that i can pay my electric bill with, plus gas), for movies i've owned for the last 10 years on dvd, and another 15 on VHS before that. Do the normal thing, wait, get Aliens for about 24 bucks or so, Alien for the same, and Alien 3(which is ok, not spectacular) for around 20. We all god ripped on lord of the rings, which was not the extended versions and people were furious, well they have a right to be. They hype all the blu-ray technology, then they half-a$$ the release by jipping the consumers out of nearly 3 hours of additional footage! Blu-ray discs have a capability of anywhere from 50 to 100gigs, so you could fit nearly all the movies on one disc alone, why has no one taken advantage of this, who knows? At any rate these movies are much like Rambo, Star Wars, Indiana Jones, and Jurassic Park, people really want them and don't want to shell out half of there rent to do so. The box set garbage has got to go, its like shopping at SAMS club where you just can't buy one candy bar if your hungry, you have to buy a pack of 30. Speaking of Rambo, i got those for very cheap, only 10 bucks a piece, now thats correct for a movie of that age, and that's what makes people actually buy these products. The Rambos, actually and the Rockys have good and great movies, so go figure. First Blood looked amazing, the rest not so much. Also with Rocky only the first and the V(come on) looked of good blu ray quality. The 3rd being my favorite, I wanted Mr T pity the fool straight up super HI DEF, which i didn't get, it was extremely grainy and the HDTV version through Comcast looked much better. Lets hope its different with these, lets ""hope"". So give us the option FOX. When it comes to the movies here's my take.

1. Aliens-The first i was exposed to, tense, funny, in your face good paced action, makes Avatar look like Marry Poppins. The first i saw at 12 or so.(Director James Cameron, Avatar, T-2, and Titanic)
2. Alien-While very slow, its still very scary because if you've never seen Aliens you don't know what your about the witness,(Newcomers start with this one). Also Ridley Scott made this one,(Director of Gladiator, American Gangster and Robin Hood(2010).
3. Alien 3-Superb acting yet lacking in suspense. You know what the Alien looks like by now, but a bunch of British inmates in a prison on another planet find out the hard way. Not bad, but it seems more like a good Crime who done it thriller, more so than Sci Fi Horror.(Director David Fincher-Seven, Fight Club and Zodiac).
4. Alien Resurrection-The worst, i can't even get through this movie, the only thing worth watching in it is the hot as hell Wynonna Ryder, wow she was cute. Other than that its cheesy, completely over the top gross, and just reminds you of a wanna be Alien movie that someone tried to make. I could have cared less if they even put this on Blu-Ray.(Director-I don't care).

So other than me complaining about the 100$ price tag, that's how i rate the movies in short. Hey at least i did:D So buy and do as you will, i'll just wait for the sold separately ones. Also hurry up Speilburg and Lucas, give us the ones i mentioned above, and don't charge us 1000$!! The Back To The Future pack is less then 50 bucks in most places, i think mainly because after the first one they were very very sup par films. Later.",1287273600,5,4253,4.295143212951432

All 4 films are presented with pristine quality and with two ways to watch it: watch the original theatrical cut or the special extended version with a indication (a ""SPECIAL EDITION"" signal) that let you know when you came to a scene omitted from the theatrical version of the movie. I saw all 4 films in 3 days and the special features were very extensive and detailed every behind the scenes problem (and from watching the documentaries for the movies, there were many problems) not to mention the bonus 9th disc that has some great archival features ranging from trailers & TV spots to a UK TV retrospective focusing on the worldwide impact of the first movie. One wish, however, is that the archival disc should've had the documentary ""The Alien Legacy"", the direct-to-video special ""The Making of Alien 3"" & the ""Alien: Resurrection"" episode of ""HBO First Look"".

1956493,5,B0000VCZK2,"Long awaited!  Thanks Fox.  The near-$100 price point seems a tad high for four movies but if they truly threw all these extras into two discs then I guess it'll be worthwhile.

Thanks Fox~!  (Thanks TheTruthHurts for helping generate such great reviews.)",1281484800,,255,5.0
1956494,5,B0000VCZK2,For those of you complaining about the blu ray set being almost 100 dollars is ludicrous.  don't you remember when  the alien quadilogy first came out on dvd the set was 80 dollars for a nine disc set.  know that the blu ray is going to be only 6 discs but that is understandable due to the higher storage capacity of blu ray discs.  these movies are all very good and I will purchase these movies on blu ray when it comes out.  100 dollars for a blu ray set with four movies and on four discs and two extra discs with special features is well worth it.  normal blu ray movies are sold for between 20 and 30 dollars.  so leave the priceing of this set alone and enjoy the movies on blu ray.,1281398400,5,690,4.066666666666666

I would only assume that it would be greater on BLURAY but we all know what happens when you ass-u-me. Its a gamble buying older movies on BLURAY but this one looks like it will be well worth it.

1956496,3,B0000VCZK2,"I love the original Alien (10/10) and Aliens (9/10).  The original was the first R-rated movie I ever watched, and it holds a special place in my heart.  Alien 3 and Resurrection are two of the worst sequels ever made, however I haven't seen the extended versions that are included in this set.  This box set has two amazing movies with a ton of features, but I have one major flaw with it.  This set is way overpriced as are many newer BR releases.  I think $60 would be pushing it, but almost $100 is insane for movies that everyone already owns with features that we've already seen.  Amazon is usually good about prices which makes me think that this set is extremely pricy elsewhere.  I'm only 14, so I can't afford pricy sets like this.  I really shouldn't be double dipping as much as I do for the amount of money I have.  Anyway, to sum things up in one sentence: This is a really great set that I will be glad to purchase if I can find it for $50 or cheaper because $90 something is just ludicrous.",1280880000,16,1007,4.257894736842105

1956498,5,B0000VCZK2,"It's going to be better than DVD, right?  Of course it will, you have to upscale a DVD to get it to 720p or 1080i.  Lets not kid ourselves, the quality will be much clearer and sound quality should be improved.

I'll take it over a VHS/DVD any day.  As a Alien fan, who has probably watched Aliens at least a few hundred times, if not more, this is a great addition that I will watch over and over again.

I will get my money out of this box-set, there's no doubt about that!

And for those of you who are worried this will just be another transfer like Predator, read the comment below, from The Digital Bits...

""And for those of you who may have worried that any of the films will suffer the same DNR-ed fate as the recent Predator  Blu-ray, I've heard from multiple sources directly involved now that such fears are unnecessary. All four films have been given brand new HD transfers and the masters reportedly look fantastic. In fact, we've been told that when James Cameron viewed and approved the new Aliens master (Aliens  being the most troublesome looking film of the series in the past quality-wise), he was VERY pleased with the results. We'll have more on this set in the days and weeks ahead. """,1280188800,12,1207,4.400900900900901

1956500,1,B0000VCZK2,"No matter how in depth these blurays are, no matter how good the picture quality is.  100-125 dollars for 4 movies, 2 that are questionable quality at best, is ridiculous.  These studios needs to get a grip on their sanity and realize they aren't selling us gold.",1279929600,22,263,4.574468085106383
1956501,3,B0000VCZK2,"One of my all time favorite movies is Aliens. I liked Alien alot as well but not enough to watch it five million times like I have with Aliens. Alien III was a slap in the face to the fans and the 4th was just plain terrible.

While I'm hopeful that this release will be awesome I do have a few concerns.

In no particular order of importance:

#1 Will the special features,commentary etc be the same stuff we have seen on previous special editions?

#2 As others have already posted, what will the picture quality be like?

#3 Don't assume that James Cameron has anything at all to do with this. He might, but he doesn't own the rights to Aliens or the characters he created. The studio (Fox?) can do whatever they want with them. If Cameron had any pull then Aliens vs Predator would NEVER have been made.

#4 James Cameron has said in the past that it would be difficult to transfer Aliens to HD becuase of the type of film he used for that movie. He said it would be too grainy for HD.",1279929600,4,989,4.2063492063492065
1956502,2,B0000VCZK2,"I have had all the best versions of Aliens be it on VHS, DVD and Laser.  I still have the Laser transfer (a special box set of Alien and Aliens, which was reviewed to be the best picture quality at the time).  However, there are portions of ""Aliens"" where the picture is grainy and weak.  Apparently, this was because all of the masters  of ""Aliens"" (I think one part of the movie in particular) were either damaged, wore out, destroyed or lost.  It appears when they put together the movie for the special edition release, they had to use (put together) the best of what they had.  Just to note, the DVD version I have also is also grainy and weak in the same areas of the Laser version. So the question is, if there are not any good masters to work with for the ""Aliens"" Blu-ray, will the quality of the picture be any better then the recent new ""Predator"" Blu-ray release (a waxy looking picture with blemishes and no depth or realism resulting from where they tried to clean up it up).",1279929600,8,989,4.3478260869565215
1956503,5,B0000VCZK2,"Although this series started before I was born, I recently became obsessed with it and it is now among my favorite movie series of all time.  Definitely in the top 5 anyway.  I found this set when searching for a box set of all the movies and being a movie buff I was excited to see all the extras included in the Quadrilogy box set.  Although a few of the special effects are dated, cheesy or downright bad, these are still some GREAT movies when you're in the mood for suspense/action/horror.  Would definitely recommend this set for anyone who not only loves sci-fi and horror movies, but also for someone who really needs in-depth coverage on the making of the films and behind the scenes information and interviews.",1279584000,,720,4.6015625
1956504,5,B0000VCZK2,"After the Lord Of The Rings fiasco it looks like they got it right! Putting bother versions of all four films all at once was the smart move! No double dipping here!

I have owned all of these movies in previous sets and they are pretty damn good. Obviously 1 & 2 are the best. Alien 3 is good, but maybe a little too dark. 4 was interesting as it was Joss Whedon's first incarnation of what seemed to be the crew of ""Firefly"". The plot was definitely not all there, but it had some good moments.

Overall this set will be a fantastic blu-ray event! Get your popcorn ready cause it's gonna get crazy!",1279497600,8,600,4.208695652173913

Both Alien and Aliens have been upgraded to blu-ray quality and not look absolutely phenomenal. It makes these already classic movies look new and fresh. In addition, the blu-ray comes loaded with special features, making of documentaries, etc., some of which weren't available on the DVD version. Overall, even if you only like the first two movies, this set is a must-have.",1279411200,,470,4.8875

Each disk also comes with a bonus disk of behind the scenes stories and ideas. It's all wrapped in one nice package. The quality of the audio and video is excellent. Best way to watch the ""Alien"" series.",1270771200,,330,4.516666666666667
1956513,5,B0000VCZK2,"I loved all of the films, but i really do hope they come out with a Blu-Ray format and even an extended version would also help. I haven't bought this product (DVD) because i'm waiting for the Blu-Ray version. thanks",1268611200,,216,4.425
1956514,5,B0000VCZK2,"The Alien Quadrilogy is a massive 9 disc set that would make any Alien fan require a fresh set of underwear. Included in this baby are 2 versions of each film, the original/theatrical editions and the directors cut/special editions. Along with that, 5 of the 9 discs are packed to the brim with special features; a very conservative count would set the extras at probably over 12 hours, and thats not counting commentaries, trailers, or the LazerDisc features. Protecting all 9 discs is an amazing 10 sleeve digipak with wonderful, glossy art covering each sleeve that, when fully extended, reaches well over a yard long. Covering THAT is a nice indented slipcover with a reflective/rainbow-ish finish. Yes, it is amazing.

Alien is the original masterpiece. I cant say much that hasn't already been said, but Alien is a terrific movie that made Ridly Scott's career and established a multi-million dollar franchise. The Directors Cut isn't much of a change from he original. Scott re-introduced some small, unneccesary scenes by shaving milliseconds from every other scene. The result ends up a bit more streamlined than the original film, but not quite better for it. Both versions of the film are suspenseful and extremely well edited, making for a horrifyingly slow movie..in a good way.

Aliens is a decent action flick. The years have overrated James Cameron's Aliens; and after seeing for the first time in years, i cant help but feel a bit disappointed. To make up for the rather blunt and unsophisticated special effects, Cameron has edited most actions scenes into little more than a clip is a Marine firing, followed by a clip of an exploding alien. This would have worked well if used sparingly, but nearly every alien/marine confrontation ends up feeling the same. The exception would be the incredible face-hugger sequence with Ridly trapped in a room and, of course, the equally impressive climax. Aliens trumps its prequel in one department however, and thats soundtrack. Both films make incredible use of SFX and ambient/background noise, but Aliens builds on that with an amazingly well orchestrated score. The Special edition of Aliens tends to drag on at times, and feels a bit bloated at over 2:30, but it features sequences that further develop characters as well as some better pacing.

Alien 3 (or cubed :P) has always been and will always be an odd beast. The movie never became what anyone wanted of it, and conflicting imaginations hurt the film. The unfortunate (and almost total) reliance on computer generated effects and characters gave an unpolished look to the entire film, as it lacked the sparing use of the creature (as in Alien) or the clever sets to limit the creature (as in Aliens). The monster in Alien 3 is almost always an obvious suit or a terrible CGI. A ridiculous plot and awful death timing (a friend dies much to early in the movie) further make Alien 3 something that cant be called great. The Special edition adds over 20 minutes to the movie, and balances character development in the first half. The first hour of Alien 3 (special) could actually be called a well developed piece of film. The second half is garbage. Despite the obviousness of the less than par movie, i cant help but feel like there could have been an incredible movie.

Alien Resurrection is....well, Alien Resurrection. Its the beginning of the nosedive into mediocrity for the Alien franchise. Alien 3 wasn't great, but it wasn't until Resurrection that a movie in the series was actually bad. Its filled with 90's action/horror cliches and an only decent performance by Ryder and Weaver. The separate versions aren't for any reason more watchable than each other but id recommend the Director's Cut.

Disc 9 fas a variety of features from all of the movies, as well as general Alien features. The majority of the extras are on the corresponding second disc of each film, with a massive documentary going over everything from initial perception to post production and everything in between. Alien Quadrilogy will bring you hours of enjoyment, specially for those interested in special features. At $30, its a steal.",1267920000,,4139,4.9496402877697845
1956515,5,B0000VCZK2,"Being a fan of Aliens since 1986, I searched the internet for the best collection I could get for the money. Once I researched the Alien Quadrilogy and saw other reviews I was sold. I even purchased the NECA Alien 18"" collector's figure to complete my collection. I watched all four movies again including the special editions and was surprised by how much information I was missing. If you are a true Alien/Aliens fan, you gotta own this title. You would not have any regrets.",1267401600,,477,4.623529411764705

1956517,5,B0000VCZK2,"My son had seen ""Alien vs Predator"" and didn't know the background of either creature so, realizing that we were remiss in his pop culture education, we bought the Alien Quadrilogy. This is a fantastic 9 DVD set that contains two versions of each movie and more extras than we will ever be able (or inclined) to watch. While not detailed reviews of each movie, here are my general observations:

* Alien  - This is a great movie that contains all of the elements of a classic sci-fi\horror. Like several other reviewers, I prefer the original release over the extended version.

* Aliens - Really good sequel which stays true to what made the original movie great. This time I liked the extended version better.

* Alien 3 - Not nearly as good as the first two, but still watchable. I think the theatrical release is the better one (other reviews disagree), but the extended version is still interesting to watch.

* Alien Resurrection - I really disliked this movie all around, it doesn't matter which version, but it still needs to be seen to round out the series.

The box cover art is in an attractive holographic like motif that looks very nice on the shelf. The DVDs are kept in a somewhat unwieldy fold out arrangement, but they do take up surprising little room.

Overall this a great value for all that is packed into this great set!

Highly Recommended!

These 4 discs come with Audio in Spanish Stereo, English Stereo and English in Dolby Digital 5.1, subtitles in Spanish and English as well and all of them have the Audio Comments by the Directors.

When you watch the special editions of the films you have the possibility of knowing when a scene not included in the theatrical version is being shown, this is done by a special edition marker, definitely a feature rarely seen in other sets. There is a whole DVD disc packed with bonus material for each one of the four films. You get to see documentaries on the score, the special effects, the set making, the casting, they have stills and more. All is narrated by the producers, actors, directors and the people involved in the making of the films.

Besides all this, there is a 9th disc which has the theatrical trailers of all the movies, it contains the scrips and an excellent documentary about all the four films as well. The box completely open is over 1.80 meters long, has an exquisite green design and comes with a little guidance book.

I give 5 stars to this set because it has everything a collector's edition set should have, the Alien Quadrilogy box set is by all means money well spent.",1249862400,2,1434,4.528957528957529

1956528,5,B0000VCZK2,"The Alien series is a series of classic films from the 70s, 80s, and 90s. Truly a standard setting series of science-fiction horror films.

The first film was directed by Ridly Scott as a slow-paced, horror suspense film. Even the 1979 theatrical version has plenty of amazing special effects that look good by today's standards. The suspense is fantastic, and the jumps are unforgetable. The Director's Cut has one or two extended scenes, but it's still an insignificant change.

The second film (Aliens) is another great film, but shoots more for an action/adventure type of flick. While I perfer the first one for pure suspense, the second film has amazing characters and amazing action sequences. Definatly a must see.

The third film is a bit underated in my eyes. Hated by critics for the sad opening and ending, the movie is still quite good. I thought that Sigorny Weaver performed her character better than any of the other Alien films. The special effects may lack and the other characters may not be likeable, but the movie was still satisfying. The Theatrical Cut is the one I perfer, since it is shorter. The Special Edition has about 30 minutes of added side-plots.

Alien Ressurection the least of all four films. I didn't like it in the first 15 minutes and didn't like the rest of the movie at all. Very terrible movie.

The special features for every film are excellent. Not only are they very well done, but they are made up of interviews, behind the scenes footage, and screen test; but they are quite compelling and good.",1232841600,3,1542,4.760299625468165

The set includes not four, but nine DVD's, four of which cover two versions of the movies--original and director's cut; and the other five covering the making of the movies, including interviews with the actors--sometimes a few humorous and enlightening moments during the filming.

It's a disgrace to have this done to the greatest Sci-Fi film of all time, shame on you Fox, lets hope you do these films justice with the Blu Ray release, if it ever comes out.........",1229817600,2,469,3.9893617021276597
1956533,5,B0000VCZK2,"This is another of my retro reviews for a product that has been around for quite awhile but I have never turned my attention to,until now.
First off I cannot believe the price drop that has occured since its' initial release;a drop of about $60-70.00....amazing.
This is a set NO Alien fan should be without. This is the WHOLE enchillada,and then some. What you get here are all four Alien movies,presented in their original widescreen formats and in two forms;in their original theatrical presentation AND in new director cuts. The most material added was in Aliens by director James Cameron and the least in the last,Alien Ressurection. I have viewed all movies in both versions and after viewing the directors' editions I have never watched anything else. The bonus footage is definitely a plus.
I have owned this set almost since its' inital release and I cannot tell you how many times I have watched and rewatched this series and it always keeps me coming back for more. Each film has been transferred wonderfully and everything,picture and sound wise,is as it should be. There is included here an extra disc with a multitude of fascinating extras and all in all the back slip cover tells us there are nearly 50 hours total worth of extras throughout the entire series discs. Just phenomenal.
Opening the set itself can be a bit unwieldy at first and takes time to get used to. It is folded into two large sections and when you take them out of the protective large cover/box it is in you lay them down and they fold out into two main parts. Each in turn folds out about three times in opposite directions so if you want to open the entire set you need ALOT of space underneath it. I would only recommend opening one section at a time. I found it a bit of a bugboo intially  but the more you play with it the more you get the hang of it.
""Alien"" was a groundbreaking picture in its' day and the rest of the movies have kept that tradition alive and well and each new director/movie has expanded on that idea(with their own sense of vision) while keeping faithful to the Alien dictum.
20th Century Fox did a superb job on this set in its' release year of 2003 and did the franchise proud in doing so;easily standing the test of time. That is why it is so unfortunate to see the franchise being dragged down by Foxs' AVP series,especially the latest offering ""Requiem"".Whether Fox has the where withall to stop this slide is problematic.
However we do have this set to remind us(and Fox) what exactly the Alien franchise is all about/should be all about;good actors,good acting,good scipts,good direction,good special effects and an unerring sense of the essence and spirit of the Alien universe. These films in this set are the foundations of the series and are a must see/have for all Alien and Sci-Fi fans everywhere. At this price there is no time like right now to get your set.",1228867200,,2887,4.6058252427184465

1956548,5,B0000VCZK2,"For a very long time, I had put off purchasing any of the ""Alien"" movies on video because it always seemed like some change was taking place that would be an improvement over my purchase.  Once the DVD format became popular, it seemed there were at least two different editions of any ""Alien"" movie available at any given time.

Then one of my brothers spotted this HUGE (9-disc) boxed set of the four movies, knew I would appreciate it, and sent me a link to Amazon's page for it.  This is what I'd been waiting for, it seems!  Each film is presented in widescreen format in both its original theatrical version and in an alternate version, there are audio commentary tracks, and there are ""making of"" videos with all kinds of behind-the-scenes footage.

Whether the alternate versions of the films are actually improved is best left to the viewer (If you really want my opinion, I think ""Alien"" was actually improved by the added scene with the cocoon, since until I saw the second film I'd always assumed the alien was simply eating or killing people.  ""Aliens"" is not improved much, but it's interesting to see the scenes in which the colony is intact and populated --- before the aliens invade --- as a contrast to its ""ghost town"" look later.  ""Alien 3"" actually suffers in its alternate version, which is far less gory and more slow-paced than its original release.  And ""Alien Resurrection"" has an alternate opening and closing scene that, for all their technical glitz, are actually less interesting than what was in the original film.)

The special features are quite a treat, especially in the case of ""Alien 3,"" which I feel is the weakest link in the chain (its high point being the clever means of disposing of the alien).  Apparently, the penal colony was originally going to be a wooden artificial world populated by neo-Luddite monks.  The alien or aliens would ambush them in a wheat-field, a visual reminiscent of the 'raptors in the tall grass in ""Jurassic Park 2.""  One monk would see Ripley as being in league with the Devil.  Thanks to endless script revisions and lack of funds (or lack of enthusiasm?), all that remains is the monk-like brotherhood that the prisoners have formed, and the general lack of high-tech weaponry.

To conclude, I would recommend this set for any fan of the ""Alien"" movies who would like to have all the versions, with their respective DVD bells & whistles, all in one box for easy access and comparison.",1219881600,,2456,4.721311475409836

There's gotta be an explanation of how everything started. If they were to create another film, they should go way back and come out with a story of how everything started. For what I understand their native planet was destroyed and migrated to other planets wiping off everything on their path. I hope to see this coming anytime soon.",1217462400,,599,4.396396396396397
1956556,5,B0000VCZK2,"While lots can (and has) already been said about this set, I just want to reiterate one thing: the best part of this DVD is the restoration of Alien.

Unfairly maligned on release mainly because it follows James Cameron's action-packed blockbuster Aliens, Alien is an intentional departure in tone from the previous chapter. Even if you don't like the film, I'd call such a dramatic shift in tone commendable by franchise standards -- it took balls to make Alien, and on that basis alone, it's so much more interesting than a lot of cookie-cutter sequels.

The highlight here, which might have been trimmed out of the theatrical version (I hadn't seen any of them before I bought this set, and I haven't bothered to watch the shorter cut since then) is the raw performance by Sigourney Weaver. The change of pace electrifies her character, both in a great softer moment with the doctor played by Charles Dance, and during the action sequences (featuring the movie's biggest blemish, an awful-looking optical Alien effect), which swoop around the corridors of the prison planet in ways that will be familiar to fans of director David Fincher and his visual style.

Of all the things uncovered by the Alien Quadrilogy, the workprint version of Alien is the strongest, a breath of fresh air into a movie that already is one. It's dark, sure, but it is what it is, and taken as part of one of the most successful movie franchises of all time, what it is is worth a look, worth a re-evaluation, worth studying and eventually taking into account as an important chapter in a great series.",1215648000,2,1582,4.745454545454545

At the price I paid, it doesn't matter if every film is a classic. The first two films are worth the price of admission for this set. I will be reviewing each film on it's separate release and will add my ratings on this review as I go along.

I prefer the theatrical releases over the expanded editions, but they are interesting to have included on this massive set. 9 discs are included and a nice neat package to house them all in. A great set for one of the most memorable creature designs since 'The Creature From The Black Lagoon'!....and that's saying something!

1)Alien - 4 1/2 Stars

I saw this film in the theater the week it opened! Deliberately paced this film delivers the goods. Although the H.R. Giger creature is rarely scene in this film, there is an undeniable intensity because there is no remorse in this creature that just wants to use it's victims as a host to breed more of it's kind to destroy anything other than itself!

Watching this film now after all these years, it does seem a bit long and maybe too slowly paced for my taste.....maybe I'm getting impatient in my old age!?? It's still a first rate Horror/Sci-fi thriller! The creature design is fantastic even though it would be improved a bit in the next film. It's a monster movie and this is one H E L L of a monster! The DVD transfer on the box set looks fantastic and there are a load of extras to keep you happy.

2)Aliens - 4 1/2 Stars

This film has a completely different feel than the original film! This is a good thing, rather than make the same movie Ridley Scott did, James Cameron, goes all out in this explosive action Sci-Fi thriller! Great FX, deliberate pacing and slam bang action make this one heck of a thrill ride!

The creature design has been tweaked in this sequel and we get to see more of it and we get to see more of them! The Queen is a site to behold and the finale is probably the best ""Cat Fight"" in film history! I rate the film 4 1/2 stars only because the length could have been trimmed a little. The DVD transfer on the box set is fantastic and you get two versions of the movie and plenty of extra material. The box set is the way to go!

3)Alien 3 - 3 1/2 - Stars
They just couldn't let there be a somewhat happy ending to Aliens! This film starts out where 'Aliens' left off. Going back to a similar style of the first film where the action is sparse, but tension is high. The premise is interesting and the FX are good, but it does take some time to get going!.....when it does it's very good and the film has a very memorable ending!

4)Alien Resurrection - 3 1/2 Stars
Action packed forth installment is actually very good! We get to see more aliens than ever in this fun and fast paced finale. While the first and third alien movies were deliberately slow, building tension along the way. This film looks more like part 2 with lots of action and fast paced fun! I didn't remember liking this film as much the first time I saw it, but it seems to have grown on me.",1212364800,2,3126,4.2758037225042305

1956575,5,B0000VCZK2,"I'd seen this countless times online and at stores. I didn't get a hold of it until nearly every major store stopped selling them. The price most asked was ranged from $50-$60 USD and when I saw the price of around $26 I just jumped at the chance to get it on Amazon.com. Right off the bat I could tell this collection was the most complete Aliens could ever get with a total of 9 disks.

With the choice of watching the original, theater viewed films, the deleted scene addition was glory in itself. It's true what some reviewers will say about seeing the deleted scenes, once you see them, you won't want to go back to the original. The additional disks to each film disk have a ton of footage to watch. Concept art, documentaries, theatrical trailers, all of it.

I've always been fascinated with the Aliens universe and I can say with this Alien Quadrilogy I am very satisfied with the amount it provides to questions and mysteries that are the Xenomorphs and the Weyland 'Company'. Even to this day the special effects of each and every Alien movie never gave me room to criticize, for that I am thrilled.

Don't hesitated to buy this collection, I didn't :D.",1209254400,,1164,4.507109004739337

The addition of the director's cuts and what not are great, the extra story line pieces that had been cutout really help to further the character development.  Only downside is the crappy aspect ratio on all movies but ALIENS (which is the correct 16:9, 1.78:1ish, ratio), 2.53... Who has a 2.53:1 TV???  NOT ME!!!  Buy it anyway, great set.

So many extra features on the history of these movies and how some of the effects were done. I had forgotten how good ""Alien"" was, not having seen it for a few years, and it was ever better than I remembered. If you look for this at Best Buy, Target or even Walmart, you'll spend at least 60.00$.  The accordion type case holding the DVDs

What I know is, this collection has everything you could possibly want in a compendium, and I mean that as spelled out by the #3 definition of the word located on dictionary.com.

Seriously, you can spend hours watching stuff about all the movies without even watching the movies.  The drama behind and history of the original Aliens was probably more compelling than the fourth film in the series.  ""Who actually wrote it?  Who then put their own spin on it?  Who's not talking to whom anymore?  Did HR Giger really offer opium to Ridley Scott the first time they met?""

I'm telling you, the back story is better than most of the third and fourth film.  But hey, I'm a sci-fi geek, in the least obsessive definition of the term, and I love all the movies.

1956588,5,B0000VCZK2,"The Alien series got better than ever in this deluxe collection that remastered and extended the saga; I don't know if it was the enhacements, the benefit of seeing all four movies in close proximity to one another, or just being able to appreciate certain aspects more now than in the mid-80s thru mid-90s, but when I saw the movies from this collected edition they were, as a whole, significantly better this time around.  The only one to come off slightly Lesser than on previous views was, ironically, ""Aliens"" - often hailed as the best of the lot - although that had more to do with certain points that were easy to miss in among all the action but, on subsequent viewings, show up a couple of inconsistencies.  More on that later.

  The original ""Alien"" was great the first time around, but is one of those movies that gets even better with the hindsight provided by the sequels.  One noticable upon the rewatch is that ""Alien Vs. Predator"" actually patched its prequel status in very well with the hints way back in 1979's original that the company that owned the salvage ship had been looking for something specific all along, and already knew what the Xenomorphs were.  Alien was revolutionary in the scale and realism of its effects, in its own way as groundbreaking as fellow 70s space smash ""Star Wars"", and revolutionary in blending the science fiction movie and the horror movie more perfectly than ever before.  The single alien creature immediately established itself as one of moviedom's most memorable monsters, and nothing about the deadly potency of that one creature has been diminished by follow-ups that featured swarms of the Xenomorphs.  All the previously excised bits that have been added back in fit extremely well and make the whole better.  The only potential quibble to be found is this: of all the remarkable traits displayed by the Alien, perhaps the most stunning was its phenomenal growth rate (I mean, how long did it take it to go from burstling stage to full-grown armored adult?).  And yet I can't remember any of the characters even really noticing the seeming impossibility of this, although a lot of time is spent covering such aspects as the Xenomoph's possession of acid for blood.  I'm not saying they should have taken that characteristic out, or necessarily even extended its time frame, but at least having some comments by the characters on the most extraordinary of the creature's lifecycle characteristics would have been a help.  Overall, it didn't do much to detract from the overall movie though.

  ""Aliens"" amps the whole thing up.  After the original had a single alien take on a small salvage crew, this one has an entire space colony threatened by a veritable army of the creatures.  Ripley, having returned to Earth after 57 years in deep-sleep,attempts to settle into as normal a life as possible.  Some time later, the company officials who initially were very disbelieving about her claims of aliens and a crashed mothership out on that barren planet, comes to her.  A colony is located on that very world, and all contact has very abruptly broken off, and they want her, purely as a 'precaution', to accompany the team they're sending off to check it out.  ""Aliens"" smartly contrasted the overwhelming prescence of the Xenomorphs in the second half of the movie by an almost total lack of the creatures in the first hour or so, allowing everything time to build up nicely.  ""Aliens"" introduced some of the series's most memorable characters, including perrennial fan favorites Newt (the little girl survivor, played by Carrie Henn) and Bishop (Lance Henrikson).  The Cpl. Hicks character (action-sf stalwart Michael Biehn) also added a lot to the show.  Awesome special effects are a high point.  Biggest flaw: inconsistency.  Take the acidic blood of the Xenomorphs.  There are times when even a small amount can do hideous, lethal damage to a human, but at other times when the battles are raging and the heavy machine guns are firing all over the place, you've got multiple aliens exploding in close proximity to various characters and they don't seem to suffer significant damage.  You could counterargue that different 'castes' or whatever of Xenomorphs have different bloodtypes, but that seems a bit contrived; and that situation is symbolic of inconsistencies that crop up a couple of times to mildly hinder an otherwise excellent movie.

  ""Alien 3"" is the most under-rated of the original quadrilogy, crashing a ship from the previous film on a remote prison planet where a bizarre socity complete with its own religion has sprung up.  It heads in the opposite direction of ""Aliens"", drastically reducing the Xenomorphs's numbers and leaving the human characters with only makeshift weapons (compared to the large high-tech arsenals of the space marines from ""Aliens"").  All the Alien movies are hybrids of various genres and styles, but if the first is the most 'science fiction'-al of them and the second fits neatest under the action movie banner, ""Alien 3"" is the most horror movie oriented of the collection.  Phenomenal effects, high-caliber acting and characterization and a whopper of a finale.

  ""Alien: Resurrection"" is the most flawed of the lot but still a very good movie; I enjoyed it much more when I saw it again than when I first saw the VHS a couple weeks afer its release. Fewer people have seen Alien 3 than the first two and therefore might not know the ending, making it harder to comment on this one without giving away Part 3's surprises.  The movie focuses on the corporation finally getting hold of actual Xenomorphs to begin work on their ultimate goal of turning them into biological weapons.  It's probably not giving anything away to say that the project doesn't go as the company had hoped.  Instead of going more into the plot I'll focus on the movie's strengths and weaknesses.  Strengths: a continued pattern of strong acting and well-done characters, with Annalee (Winona Ryder) being especially effective; tremendous effects for the creatures (including a radically new breed); an unexpectedly potent follow-up to the thread from the 'hive' scene in ""Aliens"" that implied that there actually is an emotional bond between at least some of the Xenomorphs.  Weaknesses: pretty glaring inconsistencies and implausibilities in the action, much more so than in ""Aliens"" (I'd cite examples but I'm running out of wordcount).

  Overall, Alien is 4.5 stars, maybe even 5; ""Aliens"" is four stars, ""Alien 3"" a 5-star, and ""Alien: Resurrection"" 3-and-a-half stars.  I should round my mark to four but it's hard to resist giving this a five.  Having them all together like this makes the whole even greater than the sum of its parts.  The packaging is great, there's tonnes of bonus features for those who like them (personally I don't like going behind the scenes and seeing how something is made, although I did enjoy the short director introductions before each film), and it's currently going for $30 for NINE discs, which is pretty bloody impressive.

This consists of two discs for each film, the original and an alternate version (more on that below) on the first disk, and collections of approximately 2 hours of featurettes and other bonuses on the second disc. The ninth disc is a hodgepodge of trailers and other items from previous DVD and laser disk versions. Although the extras have been released in a variety of forms over several years (the John Hurt documentary 'The Alien Saga', being the latest), THIS is the definitive version.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-20th-Anniversary-Edition-Award-Series/dp/B00000ILDD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien: 20th Anniversary Edition [Award Series</a>] (see my review). If you haven't seen this classic film, then you must be living under a rock. The collection includes the original theatrical version (which I prefer) and the ""Director's Cut"", notable for its inclusion of the controversial captain-cocooned by alien scene (controversial because from the Alien mythology developed in later films, we know that only the massive queen can lay eggs). I prefer the original (which is actually 1 minute longer), and interestingly enough, it appears that Ridley Scott prefers the original as well. The making of featurettes is extensive and reveals Giger's extensive participation and how what was originally expected to receive a b-movie budget became one of the very few examples where Fox studios followed the vision with a classic.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aliens/dp/B000G6BM00/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aliens</a>&nbsp;(see my review). This is the only sequel I know of that is rated higher than the original. This time, the ""Special Edition"" version (also on the previous 'Alien Legacy' box set) is a superior experience and exactly is how upstart director James Cameron (who had written the script prior to the release of 'The Terminator') wanted to release the film, but was constrained entirely by time limits. The result is additional scenes featuring the colonists and Ripley's family lost to the time she spent in hypersleep. As with the first installment, the featurettes are interesting and thorough, although the Viet Nam War metaphor is not as thoroughly explored with Cameron as has been in other releases.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-3/dp/B00000ILDF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien 3</a>&nbsp;(see my review). As a fan of the franchise, this was perhaps the most anticipated part of this new box set. The ""working print"" of the film (the longest of all the versions here, and complete with subtitles for missed sound editing), adds a depth to the film that was not in the original. That is, the arrival of Ripley and the characters are covered much more thoroughly, the alien creature is begotten by an oxen with a much more original look, there is an additional plot twist arising from the nature of the inhabitants (criminally delusional), and there is no ridiculously-timed chest-buster scene at the end. Still, the film is a flawed masterpiece. The film is better appreciated in light of the bad situation first-time director David Fincher had been placed in - not the least of which is an incomplete script during production and a set that had already been constructed for the ill-conceived ""wooden planet/monetary"" vision of the previously assigned director. In this sense, the three production featurettes come across as almost an apology/tribute to Fincher. (NOTE: Fincher is the only director who is not interviewed on the box set.)

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alien-Resurrection/dp/B00000ILDG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alien Resurrection</a>&nbsp;(see my review). What happens when you put the French director of 'Amelie' (Jean-Pierre Jeaunet) in charge of an alien movie? Well, foreign/art movies were all the craze in the last 1990s, so . . . Fox studios thought, ""Why not?"" In the end, many fans of the franchise did not appreciate the obviously satirical slant on this final installment. The opening scene and ending scenes (the only additions of substance) on the extended version make the film even more tongue-in-cheek. Despite the French director and crew's obvious regard for the original 'Alien' (as documented in the featurettes), armed with the return of Sigourney Weaver and the addition of superstar Winona Ryder, the director ultimately made a quirky, campy action film. But in the end, it was the last quarter of the script that makes this the weakest of all the installments by far. Postscript to Fox studios: if you had given Fincher this much creative freedom, you would have had a third masterpiece.

This is a must have set for fans of Alien.

Highly recommended for fans of Alien, Sigourney weaver, and the slimy reptilian creature, which might be back some day.  You really don't think that they're all dead, do you?

This is NOT the case with the second and third films. ALIENS is my favorite of the saga( and just about everyone else's), and the extra footage makes it that much better. The third movie just couldn't come close to the first two, but the alternate version does make it a little better. I agree with Ridley Scott, the director of the first alien. The theatrical version is the best version. The extra scenes just don't fit in well and are off timed with the rest of the movie. I enjoyed the forth movie and either version is just as good.

Alien 3 was a great movie but has alot more cursing than the other three but it fits considering it is set in a prison. There was a bunch deleted from this film and it really adds alot to it as several key scenes are completly different and make more sense IMO. The only issue is that the added scenes have degraded over time and some of the dialouge was unusable so at times the audio is hard to hear, but it is still very interesting to watch. Alien Resurection was the most underated of the four and while it's not the best it is still a good movie. The added scenes really make it that much better.

1956645,5,B0000VCZK2,"With the Alien Quadrilogy set, I am not really sure where to even begin. Yes, all 4 films are here and all are presented wonderfully. But really, it's the extras here that are the star attractions for this release. By now, you have heard how large the extras are and how ""exhaustive"" they are. So wonderfully true. Going thru every disc and feeding on the special features that are here is an epic adventure in itself right along with the actual films. 9 discs in all!. Each film comes with a second disc full of all the bonus features. Almost every person imaginable is here and accounted for in the documentaries. There are featurettes on how the films got started, Pre-production featurettes, sketches, designs, trailers, differnt camera angle scenes, deleted/extended scenes, commentaries, photo galleries, special effects and creature designs, H.R. Giger, and so on. It seems endless. The bonus disc even has a new 64 minute documentary on the first film, a Ridley Scott Q&A and more. Seriously, you will be suffering from Alien overload once you are done with this set. You already know the films, so there is no real need to go into detail about every one. Each film comes in two versions - the original theatrical run, and a director's cut version. Some of those new cuts enhance the films(Aliens), some are unnecessary(Alien), and some just don't make that much of a difference(Alien 3 and 4). 1979's ""Alien"" is a classic masterpiece. Truly original and brilliant. The extras are great. Where is Yaphett Kotto and Ian Holm?. 1986's ""Aliens"" was one of those rare sequels that is just as good, if not better, than the original. James Cameron isn't as involved as other directors in the new features, but he is there. I find the documentaries and behind the scenes features here the most interesting. The demanding Cameron, the clashes with the London crew, and so on. Good stuff. 1992's ""Alien 3"" was where it fell apart. Fincher is a great director, and there are some good moments, but it was a major disappointment. The documentaries and features are far more fascinating. Once you watch them, you may feel for Fincher and how Alien 3 was an uphill battle from the get go. Fincher is also the only director who doesn't appear in new interviews for this set. 1997's ""Alien Resurrection"" was an improvement, but by no means was anywhere near as good as the first two. Writer Joss Whedon(of Buffy fame)has condemned the film every chance he gets. Resurrection is entertaining and has some good moments and factors to it. The film is not great, but it's not the unwatchable abomination Whedon thinks it is. If not that isn't enough, the set comes with a booklet that has a small overview of every film, and tells you where the extras are, what can be found on each disc, and their running time. The Alien Quadrilogy set is a mammoth experience that hasn't been matched yet. I can't imagine what it would take to even go further than this box set. The Alien films are batting 2 out of 4, but even the lesser films are better than a lot of other stuff that is out there. This is a must have.",1176940800,2,3096,4.672161172161172

ALIENS- Ripley returns to aide in what she believes is a rescue mission but is mislead.  Jones stays home though.  More action packed as James Cameron takes the helm at this one.  Excellent sequel.

ALIEN 3- Kinda wierd how she lands on a planet used solely for a mens prison.  The dog/alien mixture is pretty cool.  Is she with Child?

Alien (1979) *****

Ridley Scott's classic is considered by many to be the best in the series (although some will argue ""Aliens"" is equally good). The film takes place in a massive space craft called ""The Nostromo"". The unsuspecting crew members receive a distress signal from a nearby planet named ""LV-426"", and decide to investigate. Upon landing, 3 crew members; Lambert, Kane and Dallas, venture off into the planets bleak, barren atmosphere where Kane, is attacked by a ""face-hugging"" spider-like creature which attaches itself to his face. Although he is in need of medical attention, Officer Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is hesitant in letting them back inside. Science Officer Ash, disregards Ripley's concerns and let's them in. And so the fun begins as the ""face-hugger"" dies and a silent, omni-potent killer quickly develops inside the unwary victim's chest, waiting for the right moment to make its grand entrance and to wreak havoc on board ""The Nostromo"".

""Alien"" is one of the best science-fiction films ever made. The acting from the ensemble cast is first-rate as is the script, direction and the film's pace is virtually flawless. Even during scenes in which nothing much is happening, the dialogue and interaction among the cast is crucial to the films plot. In other words, there is not a single scene that isn't relevant to the film.

Aliens (1986) *****

James Cameron's epic sequel has Ripley being rescued 57 years after the events of the first film. Ripley's story of her alien encounter is met with skepticism since the ""LV-426"" has been colonized and the colonists have never come across any alien life-forms in the 20 years they have been on the planet but when communication from the Colony is lost, Ripley is asked by Carter Burke, if she can return to the ""LV-426"" alongside several Colonial Marines. Ripley turns them down at first but soon realizes that these creatures must be destroyed. In order for this to happen, she has to go back. Ripley is assured by Burke that their mission is to annihilate the aliens. Once there, they discover a desolate planet in ruins and one survivor; a young girl named ""Newt"" who Ripley takes under her wing but their struggle for survival is made even more difficult when Burke's egomaniacal plot is exposed and the hordes of vicious, blood-thirsty aliens come out to play.

This sci-fi classic offers non-stop action, outstanding performances (Weaver and Bill Paxton are especially delightful) and the climactic finale is riveting. Definitely one of the best sequels ever made.

Alien 3 (1992) **
Alien 3 - Expanded Cut (2003) ***

The third installment opens with Ripley and her crew in cyro-sleep inside their ship. A ""face-hugger"" is among them and causes a disruption aboard the spacecraft. They are ejected from the vessel and crash land on ""The Fiorina 161"", a maximum security prison inhabited by violent, all-male inmates. Ripley survives the ordeal but so did a facehugger and by using a new host, an alien is born. Despite being in a maximum correctional facility, there are no weapons available, so Ripley and the convicts have no means of protection against the ever evolving species. When Ripley comes face to face with the alien invader, she discovers there is more at stake then she originally thought.

""Alien 3"" is not on the same level as it's predecessors but on its own, it's a decent thriller that delivers the goods despite too much talk and unlikable characters. Like all the films featured here, ""Alien 3"" is presented in both a ""Theatrical"" and ""Expanded"" version. The latter has over 30 minutes of restored footage which changes a couple of key elements of the plot (theatrical) and it flows much better. In my opinion, it is vastly superior to the numbing theatrical version and renders it obsolete.

Alien Resurrection (1997) ** 1/2

""Resurrection"" takes place 200 years after the episodes of ""Alien 3"". Lieutenant Ripley is dead. Using her alien-contaminated DNA, a team of scientists decide to create a Ripley clone in an attempt to reconstruct the alien species. After cloning a near perfect ""impregnated"" Ripley, they extract the alien from inside her for studying and decide to keep the Ripley clone for further testing. The new Ripley has several unusual characteristics; abnormal strength, concentrated acid for blood, and she appears to have a close kinship to her alien offspring. The aliens, on the other hand, are kept within securely built confinements, constantly being scrutinized by the scientists. These new breed of aliens are more intelligent and when left alone, they execute their escape plan. It is up to Ripley and the crew of the newly arrived ""Betty"", which includes Annalee Call (Winona Ryder) and the fearless Johner (Ron Pearlman), to try to destroy the blood-thirsty predators that are roaming within the ship.

Despite having some ridiculous plot twists, the performances in ""Resurrection"" are up to par and the film delivers the gory goods. There are plenty of gruesome deaths, state-of-the-art visual effects and the aliens themselves are impressive, especially the ""Queen"" (her birth sequence is one of the film's highlights) but it's clearly evident at this point that the franchise has run out of steam and fresh ideas. The debate can continue which is better, ""Alien 3"" or ""Resurrection"" (my pick is ""Alien 3"" - Expanded Cut but only by a hair) however ""Resurrection"" moves at a much faster pace but despite a high body count and numerous slimy beasts parading before our eyes, nothing can mask the films flaws. Overall, it is a silly movie.

This exquisitely packaged box set includes 9 DVD's in total; the 4 films, each with it's own bonus DVD and the 9th DVD includes even more bonus material. Each film is presented in Widescreen format in both a ""Theatrical"" version and an ""Extended"" version with ""deleted"" scenes restored and Audio Commentary. The films are given impeccable treatment in picture and sound. If that weren't enough, a booklet is also enclosed. Fans of the series should not be disappointed since this is one of the most comprehensive box sets ever released. They really did the series proud with this one; highly recommended.",1167609600,4,6339,5.01425855513308

1956660,5,B0000VCZK2,"The title of the review says it all.  If you are an Alien fan that is.  I won't go into the specs as those are available elsewhere.  Two of the features that make this set so noteworthy are the extended cut of Alien 3, and the extensive documentaries on all 4 movies.  Although I really enjoyed Alien 3, I still thought it was the weakest of all 4 movies.  Visually, the movie is beautiful, but story wise, it was a very hard movie to get into after two major characters from Aliens get killed off in the opening credits (not spoiling anything), and one is mangled almost beyond repair.  However, having said all that, the new version, even though not approved by David Fincher, is a much better version that the theatrical.  Definitely worth the watch.

The documentaries are hands down excellent!  Alien Ressurection's documentary is probably the weakest of the four, but still good.  Alot of excellent insight into the filmmaking process, the problems behind the camera, the short timelines, the pressures of the execs, Sigourney Weaver's non gun-toting vision of Ripley for Aliens etc... It is fascinating.  The only thing missing was the true nature of Fincher's conflicts with the execs at Fox for Alien 3, which are noticeably removed from the documentary.

A must buy, at a great price at that!",1161734400,2,1302,4.763392857142857
1956661,5,B0000VCZK2,"Well, maybe the best except for the LOTR collector's sets, but I had to buy each of them individually. Do your favorite Alien fan a favor and get them the Quadrilogy for Christmas or their next birthday, they'll love you forever. Having all four movies in two formats, the theatrical releases and extended versions, along with an astounding assortment of extras for all the extras lovers, is enough to put a movie lover in movie heaven for several days. The five star rating is for the Quadrilogy, not a comment on the individual movies contained within. (Though technically it's 4.7 stars. I take .3 of a star off for the endless foldout format of the disc storage folders.)

I won't bother going into great detail for each of the movies, since that's all been done before. I will say that Aliens is my favorite of the series, like it is for most people, mostly because of more time allowed for character development. Aliens is an action/thriller, whereas Alien is a classic horror film, much scarier with greater tension building, and arguably, a better movie. I doubt anyone who saw Alien in its original release before all the hubub was raised will forget the chest bursting scene. I would argue it's the single most shocking moment in cinema history. Hearing the cast talk about doing that scene was very interesting. Other than that, not much more to say about these two classics.

I know that a lot of fans consider the first two movies to be the only two ""real"" ones and the third and fourth movies are duds to be ignored as complete embarassments. While part of me totally agrees with that assessment, being the fan I am of the series, I am still ecstatic to own the entire set in this wonderful collection and usually watch all four of them, not just the first two. (Technically five when AVP is included.)

There's no doubt that the third movie suffered from some very serious flaws. It was very interesting to me to watch the extras included in this set which explain a lot of the reasons for that. For those who haven't had a chance yet, I highly recommend watching the extended version of the third movie. It doesn't rescue it completely, but it is much better than the theatrical release and may raise your opinion of the movie a notch. (Just overlook the very poor special effects. The FX we take for granted now were in their infancy then and it shows.)

As for the fourth movie, there were some things about it that I really liked, and some I really didn't. I thought the cloning idea and Ripley being a sort of hybrid was a daring and interesting twist to the series. It's one of the things I appreciated most about Alien Resurrection, probably because it was so unexpected.

I also found it interesting to have the intelligence of the aliens explored. In previous movies they were mostly just killing machines and little was indicated either for or against how intelligent they are. The fourth movie still doesn't answer that completely, but gives more food for thought.

On the other hand, I really didn't like the weird alien baby and I felt that the movie really lost it towards the end and almost felt as if it was part of a different movie that frittered away any positives that had been built up in the first two thirds or so.

The Alien Quadrilogy is a must have for any Alien fan, even those who are less than complementary about the second two movies. They may just find something of worth there after all when they have a chance to review this outstanding collection. And if not, they at least have the pleasure of owning the entire series in a format that serves as an example of how such collections should be designed and released.",1157846400,8,3664,4.576219512195122
1956662,5,B0000VCZK2,"This truly is the definitive set for alien fans.  It has two discs for each movie; containing the theatrical and special editions for each film, along with a ridiculous amount of special features for each film.  Along with all that is a ninth disc with miscellaneous material.
For those of you who buy things without seeing them first, let me outline the basic plots of the movies.  To see my full reviews on ""Alien"", and ""Aliens"", visit my profile.  In ""Alien"" the seven members that comprise the crew of the Nostromo, a commercial mining ship heading back to earth from a mining mission, are woken from their hybernation by ""mother,"" the ship's computer, in order to investigate a distress call coming from a nearby planet.  The crew are obliged to do this due to the ""Company's"" laws.  They descend to the planet, and three members of the crew go out to investigate.  While the crew members are out, Ripley, the crew's pilot, decides to decode the distress call, and soon dicovers halfway through translating that it isn't a distress call, but a warning.  Soon after, the team comes back, and attached to one of their faces is, is...what is it?  The rest is history.
""Aliens"" continues the saga loyally.  After the ending of the previous movie, Ripley is sent back to the planet to help investigate the loss of contact with a colony on ""LV-426"", as the planet is now called.  this movie is almost as good as the original, and most people certainly thought so, because Sigourney Weaver got an academy award nomination for best actress.
""Alien 3"" is an oft misunderstood movie, many people critizing it for the death of the remaining characters in ""Aliens"" except Ripley.  This time an egg was layed on the military ship headed for earth and it causes the ship to crash on an old prison world.  Soon an Alien is hatched and Ripley is once again fighting the nasty foe, but with a different twist...
""Alien Resurrection"" isn't that good compared to the rest of the series, but it has a couple of interesting scenes, so it's worth a watch or two.
Overall the saga is wonderful, with it's amazing first installment, to its ok finale.  Definitely worth owning in my opinion.",1156118400,2,2171,4.678947368421053

1956664,5,B0000VCZK2,"This collection of the four Alien films plus the bonus features really puts you back into the sci-fi, thriller and horror roots that the Alien movies carry.  What was seen through the human eye inside the theater in 1979 will now be known as a sci-fi and horror film icon.  The movie that started it all with a handfull of frightened viewers made this movie what it is today.  A movie icon.  Four different directors showed their Alien visions by directing these movies.  The last three showed their Alien vision to keep the franchise going into what it is known as today.  Unfortunately after the final minutes of Aliens the franchise began to slow down.  It was still okay to watch because once you have seen the first two you would want to know what happens next.  Ridley Scott the director who started this franchise showed his vision for Alien.  Alien is a compelling jaw dropping film that showed its roots for terror.  After the start of franchises such as Friday the 13th or Nightmare on Elm Street comes the sequils.  The sequils following Alien were made continuing such success Alien has made.  Of course Alien is one of the movies that shows sci-fi's darker side.  The story of seven crew members on a space ship heading towards earth who encounter an Alien cast away opening the door to terrifying science fiction shown in four films.

ALIEN-If there wasn't an Aliens this would be the best film in the franchise.  Comes extremely close to being the best one.  What started it all: The Alien, Ripley, and the suberb sci-fi terror.  If you were to see all the other ones first without seeing Alien first you would be lost until you did see this one.  Not criticizing anyone who has seen the others without seeing this one.  As said comes extremely close to being the best.  So close it gets 4.99.9 out of 5.  Just needed another. 1 to go.

ALIENS-The best one in the franchise.  Over five decades later Ripley awakes from her sleep since the Alien wrecked havok on the Nostromo.  There Ripley and a team of marines discover more Aliens and begin to fight to survive.  Not everyone survives of course as known throughout other movies like these.  Ripley protects a girl named Newt through this second round of Alien madness.  More action contained in this movie than Alien in my belief.  James Cameron did a very excellent job directing this and made this sequil as part of what he is known of.  Being a master action and drama director.

ALIEN 3-So obviously what movie script writters, movie producers, and movie directors have on their minds when they make a third sequil in a franchise is to make it as good as the first two.  Obviously it might not be as good as the first two (which Alien 3 wasn't as good as the first two) but mainly the ones making a third sequil want it to just not suck.  Alien 3 did not suck but it was sort of close to not being good at all.  From here they should have stopped the franchise unless they could come up with something better to add onto the franchise.  What the script writter did was just make an excuse to just have Ripley be the only sole survivor of another round of Alien madness.  But there were two others.  Hicks and Newt.  But maybe they were not meant to be in the setting that Alien 3 was in.  Once I heard about this set not seeing the movies I saw the Alien 3 trailer.  Sigourtney goes bald and I was thinking did she shave just because she wanted to?  No.  She shaved because they wanted to (the people behind the story of Alien 3).  Crash an escape pod because of an Alien stowaway if you will but if Ripley survives shouldn't the others survive as well?  The least favorite in the series.

ALIEN: RESSURECTION-After Alien's least successful film comes the second least favorite in the series.  The reason why this was better than Alien 3 was because of its action.  A very big dissapointment was to see Ripley become a clone.  When they should have stopped after Aliens, they continued with the two worst additions in the franchise that were still okay.  But if they were to have a third sequil then they should have stopped there.  This was still better than the third release but a cloned Ripley made me dissapointed.  The end of Alien 3 could have made a good end to the franchise in my opinion.  Here the movie makers of this film semmed like they made the others especially the first one dissapear into the would of classics.

The bonus features help make this box set a must own for any Alien fans and not just the die hards.

The movie ratings:

ALIEN-4.99.9/5  The perfect start.  Lives in the world of classics but never dissapeared.

ALIENS-5/5  The perfect sequil.

ALIEN 3-2.5/5  Not completely bad.  Still okay but my least favorite

ALIEN: RESSURECTION-3/5  The second worst in the series.  Still okay.

Overall this is the must have set for the Alien fan.",1154908800,,4841,4.516166281755196
1956665,5,B0000VCZK2,"Most franchises are about one-upping the previous installment. The ALIEN franchise is altogether different. Each director brought a different vision to the franchise, and each one is excellent in its own way. ALIEN is creepy and suspenseful, and it focuses heavily on the players. The alien is not seen very often, and the anticipation of those rare moments of horror actually heighten the film's impact. ALIENS is the finest film of the ""quadrilogy,"" and one of the finest sci-fi films every made. It's a nail biter, and somehow manages to balance breathtaking action with intense character study. Of all the films, this one has by far the most memorable cast. ALIEN 3 is a depressing but impressively accomplished film. Ripley spends most of her time in anguish, though she does finally get a fleeting moment of sexual satisfaction. The beloved survivors of the second film are dispensed with from the outset, and while that has sparked an outrage among fans of the second film, it does enable the third one to focus on Ripley's private hell, and so serves a sad but necessary purpose. This is the most intimate film of the series. ALIEN RESURRECTION recycles some of the main themes and scenes from the previous installments, but, as MONS from Denmark remarked, ""...it simply doesn't take itself as seriously.... There's more comedy, more snappy one-liners and...cinematic dexterity..."" This film, which is a lot of fun, actually is a very logical follow-up to the third film. It finally brings to the fore the conspiracy to capture and utilize the aliens for human gain, and it makes the most of Ripley's death. By the way, I happen to enjoy the hybrid alien. It's at once lovable and horrific: quite a marvel of duality. EACH FILM offers a fresh approach to the conflict between human and alien, and I think this is the key to enjoying the franchise as a whole. Since I was already familiar with each film in the franchise due to repeated viewings, when I purchased the Quadrilogy, I watched only the special editions. While they all improve upon the original theatrical releases, the films that gain the most are ALIENS and ALIEN 3. I think the director's cut of ALIEN is virtually a wash. As for ALIEN RESURRECTION, I particularly liked the new Earth-bound ending, which does seem to bring closure to the series. When Ripley says, ""I'm a stranger myself,"" she recognizes that she is ""alien"" to the world from which humankind sprung. And yet, paradoxically, despite being an alien/clone DNA cocktail, she has also become vastly more human. After killing Ripley off in the third film, I am grateful that an incarnation of Ripley has returned to bring the series to a satisfactory conclusion. In closing, I would say that Ripley, as a character, evolves and devolves over the course of the franchise, and that her personal odyssey is the real thrust of this series. The aliens, through the plot situations they impose upon the character, provide the catalyst for this personal odyssey. This series is a four-course meal, not a one-plate buffet with ever bigger helpings. And while I have also watched ALIEN VS PREDATOR a few times and found it to be an exciting film, it doesn't fit well into the ALIEN franchise, because Ripley, not the aliens, is the heart and focus of this excellent sci-fi series.",1154131200,2,3305,4.861702127659575

20th Century Fox re-releases the ultimate set to one of its more lucrative film series - ""Alien"".

This 9 disc set is a monsterous edition featuring 2 discs per each of the four films & a 9th disc with previous features from both the ""Alien"" & ""Aliens"" special laserdisc editions.

""Alien"" - disc one has both the original '79 release & the special edition release from 2003. The '79 release is better (the additional scenes in the '03 release were not needed. Ironically enough, I own the 1992 special edition laserdisc edition & through the use of a highend VCR I edited the deleted scenes back into the final film. That was in 1999. So when I saw the 2003 S.E., I wasn't really that impressed since my copy of the film matched Scott's new edition). The saving grace on the 2003 edition is the DTS track (sounds awesome!).

Disc 2 has all the supplemental docs & featurettes on the making, production, & releasing of the '79 classic.

""Aliens"" - the best out of the four. Released 20 years ago today (7/18/1986), ""Aliens"" is one of the best sequels in film history right up there with ""The Empire Strikes Back"", ""Terminator 2"", & ""The Godfather Part II"". It's also, arguably the best film James Cameron has done outside of his ""Terminator"" films (yes, that includes ""Titanic"").

Disc 3 has the 1986 theatrical release & the 1991 special edition. The special edition is the one to go with for ""Aliens"". The added scenes give more character to Ripley. The audio is Dolby Digital 5.1 & THX certified.

Disc 4 houses all new documentaries & featurettes on the film. Simply put, everything you ever wanted to know about ""Aliens"" can be found here.

""Alien 3""  - with the bar set really high with the first two films there was no place to go with a third ""Alien"" film but down. David Fincher's disasterous third ""Alien"" film is presented here, warts & all.

Disc 5 has both the 1992 theatrical release with the newly restored special edition. It doesn't really matter which version you watch, it's still ""Alien 3"".

Disc 6 has all the docs & featurettes to ""Alien 3"", but, the one thing disc 6 can't do is, explain why David Fincher refused to be interviewed or help restore the workprint copy of ""Alien 3"".

""Alien Resurrection"" - the series runs out of gas & becomes cliched with this third sequel. Sigourney Weaver got a producer credit on this film (as well as an 11 million dolar salary for her return as Ripley). Joss Whedon, of ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"", helped write the story & script. ""Alien Resurrection"" is a mess strung together with a few decent action scenes & nothing else.

Disc 7 contains both the theatrical version as well as the extended opening version with disc 8 housing all documetaries & featurettes.

The ninth disc doesn't have a lot of new stuff if you previously owned the laserdisc special editions to ""Alien"" & ""Aliens"". The laserdisc archives from both of those editions are here as well as the usual trailers & t.v. spots. There is a cool featurette on hollywood monster caretaker Bob Burns & how he aquired all of the props from the four ""Alien"" films. It's definitley worth a look.

This quadrilogy set to the ""Alien"" films may or may not be the final release to these films. But if there is another re-release it will be hard to top this one.",1153180800,6,3691,4.573596358118361

1956672,5,B0000VCZK2,"The Alien series never broke out the way that Star Trek and Star Wars did--you don't see the presence of an Alien-worshipping subculture, the way you do with Roddenberry's and Lucas's franchises. However, the series has been far more inventive and varied than those two franchises. Explore the Alien movies (minus the abomination known as Alien vs. Predator) on this 9-disc set. Even though they are very different films which have little commonality, aside from the presence of those vicious monsters and the lovely Sigourney Weaver, they complement each other well, and collectors would be wise to pick up this boxed set instead of buying the movies piecemeal. Far from being simple horror films, the Alien movies are attempts to put into film the anxieties of the modern age, from the biological to the corporate, and the series is at its best when it exploits these anxieties.

This is what the first entry in the series, Alien, does best. Directed by Ridley Scott, whose other work includes Blade Runner and Gladiator, this 1979 film pits a group of commercial astronauts against a foe which cannot be killed and will not be placated. With a cast that includes Weaver, Tom Skeritt, Yaphet Kotto, John Hurt, Harry Dean Stanton and Ian Holm, this is probably the most impressively-acted of the bunch, and Scott has style to spare. Unlike most terror films, this movie derives its thrills not from continual pop-ups at the screen, but from building a sustained mood of dread--the alien could pop up at any moment. When it does come, it doesn't stay around for long. Perhaps the movie's greatest attribute is its allegorical simplicity--one is bound to reflect on what the alien represents? Perhaps it's a Rorshach Ink Blot to some extent, however, this movie is the perfect counterpoint to such movies as Independence Day--instead of taking off and kicking ass, in Alien, nothing we can do can protect us from the Alien. In our post-Iraq, post-9/11 nation, perhaps this film will have gained some resonance in its treatment of the subject matter.

Aliens might be decried by some as a pure action film, but it is a bit more than that. James Cameron logically extends the concepts in the first film, and while it lacks the atmosphere and creepy suspense of the first movie, it is an extremely exciting and emotionally satisfying film. In this film, Ellen Ripley returns to the beast's planet with a squad of marines, which includes such personalities as the humane Cpl. Hicks (Michael Biehn), the freaked-out Pvt. Hudson (Bill Paxton) and the macho Pvt. Vasquez (Janette Goldstein). Also in the mix are Paul Reiser as the personification of corporate malfeasance, and Lance Henriksen as a sinister-seeming android. Trivia note: Henriksen would be the only actor (aside from Weaver) to appear in more than one Alien film. Ultimately, this is a movie where the thrills come from stuff popping out at you, but if you are willing to suspend disbelief a little and come along for the ride, it is actually quite good for a genre picture, and became the benchmark against which the later pictures were compared.

Alien3 is a film which never got a fair chance. Consider: a script which underwent more than a few major revisions, several changes in directors which actually produced the perfect man for the job (future Fight Club auteur David Fincher), a meddling studio and fan expectations which could not possibly have been sated. It was, in retrospect, a recipe for disaster, so one should not complain about how flawed it is, but rather realize just how good it is. Fincher manages to create a wholly convincing atmosphere of dread in a prison planet populated by monk-like inmates. It takes up the allegorical mantle again, but rather than the open-ended allegory of the first, this installment has overt religious parallels that anyone even remotely familiar with Western Civilization should be able to pick up on (even though some of the imagery is subtle). This set notably includes the Assembly Cut, billed euphamistically here as a ""Special Edition"", which is far closer to the movie Fincher intended to make. While there are any number of legitimate complaints against the film--the most sympathetic character dies halfway through, many of the inmates never really stick out, the final action sequence is too disorienting, high on gore but low on scares, etc.--it is actually a rather compelling film in its unedited form. Not perfect, but in terms of the plotting, main characters, and its insight into the mindset of the religious isolationist mindset, it is more than adequate. In terms of visuals and mood, no installment of the Alien series has been better. In my book, it's a good film with flaws rather than a flawed film with some good parts. The beginning and ending are contentious--watch the film and you will see why--but both serve the story, and the ending in Fincher's version is a surprisingly powerful one, as opposed to the theatrical version, which might have some Biblical undertones (the story of Jacob, specifically) but it feels more hollow. Overall, with this restored version, hopefully the movie will see an end to the backlash that has been pervasive since its release in 1992.

Alien Resurrection is the final film in this group, and while it is less polarizing than Alien3 among fans, it is also less memorable. If the original film was about a post-Vietnam set of anxieties, then this film is about a post-Berlin Wall set of ironies, and it cannot be displaced from the culture from whence it came--a culture which prided itself on being so ""over"" everything. Yet another director, this time Jean-Pierre Jeaunet of Amelie, brings a different twist to the franchise. Armed with a screenplay by TV wunderkind Joss Whedon, and game performances from Weaver, Winona Ryder, Ron Perlman, et al. The fundamental problem is that the viewer never really connects with the characters, and thus isn't invested in their fates. This being the case, the movie then becomes a series of action setpieces which don't quite add up to anything. The visual style is surprisingly lacking here as well: I once heard Amelie described as a David Fincher take on a Meg Ryan film, so I expected memorable visuals. I instead discovered that Roger Ebert was right when he said there was not a single shot to inspire the imagination. While the production values are high, the grotesque violence, fast-paced editing, camerawork and lighting all come together to make one feel as though in a video game, and while that might work for fourteen year-old boys, it's a far cry from the film's heritage. On the other hand, the satirical aspects of the film are enjoyable, and it somehow was much more beloved in Europe--maybe I'm missing something. Ultimately, the film is either a standard-issue thriller or a savvy satirical deconstruction of a standard-issue thriller--I'm not entirely certain.

The bonus features are interesting--commentaries on all the four films, featuring directors, cast members, and production staff. I guess that, given the amount of commentary tracks punctuated by uncomfortable silences, the folks over at Fox decided to cut to different conversations at different points during the films. There is a constant stream of information, some interesting and enlightening, other parts are funny (Bill Paxton's contributions especially), but the only one that is tough to sit through is Alien3's, which is unbalanced in favor of the technical side of the production and only has about 15 minutes of Henriksen and another actor. The documentaries go into great detail about all the films, essentially from the germination of the story all the way through to critical reception. Overall, it's a good collection of special features.

Overall, as far as franchises go, the Alien films are one of the better bets out there. As a receptacle for millenial anxieties, a proving ground for new and talented directors, and just plain scares, this is a series which should appeal to most and I highly recommend this set.",1146873600,106,8032,4.9992526158445445
1956673,5,B0000VCZK2,"I am one of few people I know that loves ALIEN 3.  To rediscover it here, with the rest of the films in the series, was a treat indeed.  FOX has pulled out all of the stops and created one of the greatest box sets of all time.  There are endless extras and even archived material from the original special edition Laserdiscs from the first two films.  Each film has been restored in original theatrical form and then with a special edition (Cameron's ALIENS and Scott's ALIEN had been available before, on Laserdisc and theatrically, respectively) but the real find for me especially is the new look that ALIEN 3 gets.  David Fincher's directorial debut was a mess at the start, but the workprint version we get to see (by no means definitive or a director's cut, as Fincher had no involvement in this release at all) rounds out what he was trying to attempt and gives us an all around better film.  All that aside, bravo for everything this disc includes, even though I could have done without ALIEN RESSURRECTION (what works in Joss Whedon's other works doesn not work here, and even the talents of Jean-Pierre Jeunet are squandered in a basic rehashing of all things ALIEN).  Despite that, if you are a fan of the series, this box set is a must.",1142726400,3,1248,4.52
1956674,5,B0000VCZK2,"I got this set for my last birthday and loved it. It's very cool that the original theatrical verion and the director's cut of the 1st Alien movie are included. I prefer the director's cut just because... well... IT'S THE DIRECTOR'S CUT!!!!!! I think my favorite Aline movies are the 1st because it's the scariest and Aliens because it introduces the Queen  Alien. It bugs me that they couldn't record the 3rd Alien movie right and had to add subtitles whnever you couldn't hear the character's talking; it's also my least favorite Alien movie(even though it's the movie where we get to see the most aliens). Alien Ressurection is okay. It's definately seeing the Alien- that Ripley had in her- all grown up and unlike any other alien. It was pretty funny seeing Ripley's alien rip the head off the queen alien after it didn't recognize the scent of her. In this movie the queen doesn't have both a full body and an egg sack. It's just half a body and the rest is a big egg sack. I personaly like the 5-foot unfolding box set. The hlographic discs are also cool, and the DVD menus of each movie is also pretty cool, too.

 I own a lot of box sets of DVDs(all the seasons of the Simpsons, the Friday 13th collection, the Nightmare on Elm Street collection), and this would have to honestly be my favorite.

I even enjoyed the deleted scenes of Aliens. Though i understand why they removed them, except for the Colonist piece the rest seemed like filler.

You just have to take the other films for what they are Alien is more of a sci/fi suspense film, the latter two  are more Hollywood summer Blockbustrer fodder but entertaining none the less. It gives you a greater appreciation for the subject and the Aliens do make a great monster. you have to be a true fan to enjoy the films completely but I do recommend the set.",1142294400,2,931,4.344827586206897

I'm not sure I found the eight movie versions and countless hours of extras worth all the fuss, but you can't say Fox was stingy about offering fans everything they could ever have wanted in an ""Alien"" set.

Alien

The last time I was scared by a film in a theater it was 1979 and ""Alien."" Before that it was the 1963 adaptation of ""The Haunting,"" and when I was a kid it was ""The House of Wax."" What do all of these films have in common besides fright? They're basically about haunted houses. That is, they are all set in enclosed areas with things largely unseen going bump in the night, then springing out and going ""boo""! So ""Alien"" is more than a hair-raising sci-fi thriller; it's a darned good horror flick too.

Director Ridley Scott said that his idea for ""Alien"" was to make a kind of space truckers picture, featuring a crew of long-haul space jockeys on an interstellar cargo run. The gigantic space freighter makes a perfect stand-in for the old dark house of earlier times, and Scott is canny enough not to let the audience see too much of his monster until the very end. Even then we aren't sure what we've seen, except that it's really scary. The story plays on the principle that people are most frightened by things they don't see, that imagination can be more terrifying than reality, that suspense can be more hair-raising than mere shock. So when the cargo ship Nostromo accidentally picks up a deadly alien creature that keeps changing shape as it matures, we see the thing almost exclusively in the background, blending in among the shadows and ducts and hanging chains, only occasionally popping out to do its dirty deeds.

The cast is a prime example of ensemble acting, with each performer formidable enough to carry the film alone, yet each working seamlessly with the others to produce an on-screen unit we care about. Sigourny Weaver stars as Lt. Ellen Ripley, a woman of sense and resource, whose heroic qualities would come to the fore even more strongly in the film's sequel, ""Aliens."" Tom Skerritt plays the Captain, Dallas, a strong, charismatic personality who at first appears to be the main character, a notion squelched before the film gets too far along. Ian Holm is Ash, the science officer, a menacing presence with a cold, detached manner. John Hurt is Kane, the man who inadvertently brings the alien creature aboard the ship. Veronica Cartwright plays Lambert, the crew's most vulnerable character. And Yaphet Kotto and Harry Dean Stanton play Parker and Brett (""Right""), the ship's maintenance team.

Not least among the filmmakers is H.R. Giger. Much of the motion picture's creature design, set design, and artwork is based on his drawings. Giger is the fellow whose soft, round, intricately curving, often cold, yet fluid designs have influenced everything from video games to automobiles. His vision of the alien spacecraft is that of a gigantic womb and the alien monster's head a giant penis; viewers may make of this whatever they like.

Finally, there is Mother, the ship's onboard computer, as vital, as comforting, and as sinister as HAL was in ""2001."" Mother serves to remind us that the business corporations behind these intergalactic cargo operations value money and power over human lives.

In addition to the regular theatrical release version of ""Alien,"" there is the Director's Cut, which Fox asked Scott to create by adding many of the scenes he had initially left out, including the famous cocooning scene. When Scott was finished with it, however, he thought it was too long and that the added material threw the pacing off. Therefore, he cut his own Director's Cut. The result of his tinkering is a freshly edited film that includes more new stuff and less old stuff, coming in one minute shorter than the original. Scott says he still prefers his original version, but now, at least, you have a choice of the two editions.

""Alien"" is among those films that did not get the best reviews when it first appeared but has since gained a reputation as a classic. The picture joins Scott's later ""Blade Runner"" in taking a while to catch on. I hope by now ""Alien"" doesn't need any further praise to ensure its place as one of the best sci-fi horror films ever made. Both versions of the movie get a Film Value rating from me of 9/10.

Aliens

""Aliens,"" from 1986, is that rarity in Hollywood, the successful sequel. Its accomplishment is due in part because it retains the dark, brooding quality brought to it by its predecessor's director, Ridley Scott, and in part because its new director, James Cameron, completely changes its temper. Where ""Alien"" was largely a gothic horror flick, packed with suspense, ""Aliens"" is an action adventure, loaded with thrills. The notion that either of them is a science-fiction flick is entirely coincidental.

As you know, at the end of the first film, Lt. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) was the sole survivor of an attack upon her interstellar cargo ship by an alien creature. She ended up getting into an escape module, scuttling the main spacecraft, placing herself into hibernation, and more or less hoping for the best. Fifty-seven years later she's finally picked up. Naturally, the company she works for is peeved that she blew up an expensive space freighter and is none too willing to believe her story about monsters. She gets stripped of her command, demoted, and humiliated. Things are tough all over.

Then a snake shows up in the person of Carter Burke (Paul Reiser), who represents the corporation. He wants Ripley to return to the alien planet. Seems they have lost contact with the colony of settlers they sent up there some years before. Colonists? On the alien planet? Are they mad? With no little persuasion the company gets Ripley to go back, and the adventure starts all over again. Only this time, it's with a vengeance. There is no longer just one creature to deal with, but dozens, maybe hundreds of them. More is not necessarily better, but in this case it's just as good.

The movie starts with a thrill a minute and works its way up. There's never a dull moment. The only blemish on the film is the crew of Colonial Marines that Ripley has to put up with. They are an embarrassment to an otherwise intelligent script, a group of gung-ho hotshots who are arrogant, immature, wisecracking show-offs with attitude. Their presence is meant to add color and excitement to the story, but, in fact, they are just plain silly. No serious military unit would put up with their antics for a minute. Among them is Hudson, a perpetual whiner, played by perpetual whiner Bill Paxton; Hicks, a reluctant hero, played by Michael Biehn; Gorman, a useless young lieutenant with almost no combat experience, played by William Hope; and yet another robot, Bishop, played by Lance Henriksen (""I prefer the term 'artificial person' myself."") Finally, there is Newt, an adorable little girl they find on the planet, the only one to escape the alien creatures alive (or without being cocooned), who gives Ripley someone to mother. Ripley is clearly the only capable character in the bunch, and before long she takes over like Rambo. Maybe it's no coincidence that director Cameron was the screenwriter for ""Rambo II"" a year earlier. Ripley gets ample occasion to act heroically and, as usual, to run around in her underwear.

Cameron adds a few surprises to ""Aliens"" to make it as different as possible from ""Alien,"" but basically it's the same idea. Just more ugly critters, some of the best monsters ever designed, by the way, and more action. It was the right route to take. We had already been served up the suspense of wondering what the alien creature was all about in the first story, so what was left was fighting a battle royal with a whole army of them. Even better, we not only get the original theatrical release but the newer Special Edition in which Cameron appended about twenty minutes of additional material, including scenes revealing Ripley's past and depicting the colonists' first discovery of the alien creatures. This is one film in either version that will definitely keep you awake. As with the first film, I have to give it a 9/10.

Alien 3

The third and fourth installments in the ""Alien"" series--""Alien 3"" and ""Alien Resurrection""--are every bit as bad as the first two movies are good. Not even director David Fincher, who went on to better things (""Seven,"" ""Fight Club""), was much help. In 1992's ""Alien 3"" the filmmakers actually seemed to be going out of their way to end the whole affair so they'd never have to make another sequel. They certainly do everything in their power to turn an audience off, not only by creating a painfully depressing atmosphere for their picture but by killing off every sympathetic character in sight, including the star! It didn't help, of course; they merely brought Sigourney Weaver back from the dead in the fourth movie. Never underestimate the power of money.

You will recall that at the end of ""Aliens,"" Ripley was headed back to Earth along with her pal Hicks; the adorable little girl, Newt; and the faithful artificial person, Bishop. Well, sorry to disappoint anybody, but as soon as the new movie begins, her friends are already dead. Only Ripley survives. So much for sentiment. You know from the outset this trip isn't going to be pleasant. Ripley crash-lands on a near-deserted planet inhabited by only a few dozen people in an abandoned maximum security prison. Need I say she brings another alien creature along, unbeknownst to her, which soon runs amuck, picking off each character one by one? You're right; I didn't need to tell you.

Weaver's supporting cast is weaker this time out, too. Where she had a strong group of individuals around her in ""Alien"" and a goofy troop of stereotypical hotshots in ""Aliens,"" in this third entry her fellow actors are almost nondescript. Charles Dance as Clemens, the prison doctor, comes closest to being an interesting character, but it doesn't last long. Charles Dutton as Dillon, the leader of the prisoners, is also in the running but has little to do. Brian Glover doesn't make much of an impression as a blustery prison superintendent. Not even the usually dependable Pete Postlethwaite stands out in this crowd. Part of the blame must go to the director, who seems to know only one speed, fast forward, and another part to the script, which is basically more of the same. Speaking of which, everything in the film even looks the same. The colors are the same, various shades of brown, the prisoners' uniforms are the same, and their facial appearance is the same, thanks to their shaved heads. To make matters worse, the filmmakers want to be sure that we won't find Ripley's looks any longer appealing, so Ripley shaves her head, too! It doesn't work. She's still attractive.

Whether you watch the regular theatrical release or the new, thirty-minute longer Special Edition of ""Alien 3"" (an ""assembly cut,"" with rough patches in some parts of the dialogue that require subtitles), the film adds little beyond more blood and gore to mark its entry into the ""Alien"" canon. It is an insufferably dismal story of doom and gloom meant to close out the series forever. But didn't. If you are truly an ""Alien"" fan, you will want to quit after ""Aliens"" and assume that Ripley and her friends make it back to Earth safely. Just pretend the last two sequels didn't happen. Film value: 5/10.

Alien Resurrection

There are some people I've talked to who liked 1997s ""Alien Resurrection"" quite a lot, but they were young folks who had never seen the first two installments in the series or hadn't seen them in theaters. I suppose if you have nothing to compare ""Resurrection"" to, it might seem all right. In this final (one hopes) episode, it's two hundred years down the road from ""Alien 3,"" and Ripley is long gone. If only. No, she's been cloned, and the replica has an alien queen in her! I find that idea corny, but what are you going to do? Whatever; the reason she was cloned was to obtain a new alien creature and create an army of them. The half-human, cloned Ripley is then kept alive, and when the film begins we find her on a spaceship with the alien monster.

By the way, about this ship. I mean, two hundred years of technological advancement have passed, and the spacecraft looks basically the same to me, inside and out, as the ones in the first two movies. Well, a dark, old haunted house is a dark, old haunted house.

The main change in ""Resurrection"" is a weird mother-daughter relationship between Ripley and the alien, plus the usual assortment of supposedly colorful characters we have come to depend on. Another spaceship, you see, docks with Ripley's and it contains an assortment of grizzled occupants. There are also a few interesting set design variations to keep one entertained and some bizarre humor, but I'm not sure any of it is worth the trouble.

Co-starring with Ms. Weaver this time out are Ron Perlman, Dominique Pinon, Gary Dourdan, Michael Wincott, Dan Hedaya, Kim Flowers, J.E. Freeman, Brad Dourif, and, of all people, Winona Ryder. None of them are particularly noteworthy, but they all give it their best shot.

Again, the viewer has the choice of watching the regular theatrical release or a new Special Edition, which director Jean-Pierre Jeunet calls an ""alternative expanded cut."" It is about seven minutes longer than the original version and includes new opening and closing sequences. In the case of either version, the result is more of the same, with only a few differences in the cheeky wisecrack department.

Neither of the last two movies has the suspense or thrills of the first two entries in the series. Film value: 5/10.

Video:

All four films are remastered to THX-certified standards in their original theatrical dimensions, all but ""Aliens"" presented in an anamorphic widescreen ratio measuring approximately 2.13:1. ""Aliens,"" the odd man out, is presented in a 1.74:1 anamorphic ratio.

I found the video quality of the first, older film, ""Alien,"" the best of all, crisper and sharper than on any previous tape or disc incarnation I'd seen of it and better defined than the other three, newer ""Alien"" films. The other films seemed a little less well delineated, a tad softer, than ""Alien."" I wondered why this might be the case, the older film looking better, and could only hypothesize that the older film being shorter might have needed less compression to fit two versions of it on one side of a disc. A check of the bit rates of the four films, however, revealed that they were all transferred with about the same amount of compression. Maybe the differences I saw were just in my mind's eye. In any event, all the films come off well, with only minor moir effects noticeable here and there and occasional darker areas of the screen very slightly obscuring inner detail. Nothing to worry about. Certainly, the two newer films looked the cleanest. I'd give ""Alien"" a 9/10 and the others an 8/10 or 9/10.

Audio:

The THX-certified audio is presented in both Dolby Digital 5.1 and DTS 5.1. In DD 5.1 it ranged from good to brilliant. As expected, the sound quality gets better as the movies get newer. ""Aliens,"" originally recorded in Dolby Stereo, has fewer discrete surround effects, while ""Alien Resurrection"" has the most. All four films display ample frequency range and dynamic response, however, with the later movies sometimes shaking the rafters. Still, for me it was the small, delicate sounds that created the best atmosphere and suspense rather than the loud booms and crashes. For this reason, ""Alien"" still wins the day, regardless of its somewhat limited surround. I'd give the sound for ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" an 8/10 and the other two 9/10.

Extras:

The extras are found on four alternate discs (one disc of bonus items devoted to each movie), plus a fifth disc of sundry other supplemental materials. They make a formidable array of things to click on and seem designed to keep a viewer from buying anything else on DVD for at least a month, because that's how long you'll need to get through it all (providing you devote most of your life to it).

Two things before we begin, though, one pleasant, the other annoying: (1) the number of individual bonus items is so large you're sure to wear your fingers ragged with punching buttons unless you choose the easy navigation system, whereby you can play all the featurettes or artwork or photos in one continuous sequence; and (2) the packaging has to be the most awkward ever devised for a DVD set. All nine discs are housed in a single, foldout box, which, when completely open, measures over five feet from end to end. Now, here's the problem: The whole thing starts fanning out in the middle, so in order to get to disc one, you have to unfold two-and-a-half feet of box. Worse, in order to reach the booklet insert, located in a pocket at the other end, you have to unfold another two-and-a-half feet! That's a nuisance, to say the least. Individual, slim-line double keep cases for each movie and one regular keep case, housed in much the same slipcase they use now, would have been more practical for the user. But perhaps Fox felt it would be too expensive.

Anyway, here are a few of the items in the multitude of extras department: All four movie discs include THX Optimizer sets of audiovisual tests, English and Spanish spoken languages, English and Spanish subtitles, and from thirty-two to forty-four scene selections. I won't even attempt to cover all the rest of the things on the bonus discs--the reader can check out the ""Disc Details"" for that--but I'll highlight some major components I found interesting.

Disc one contains the 1992 theatrical version of ""Alien"" (117 minutes) and the 2003 Director's Cut (116 minutes). In addition, it contains a short introduction by director Ridley Scott; an audio commentary with director Ridley Scott, writer Dan O'Bannon, executive producer Ronald Shusett, editor Terry Rawlings, actors Sigourney Weaver, Tom Skerritt, Veronica Cartwright, Harry Dean Stanton, and John Hurt; plus optional deleted-footage markers to indicate where changes were made in the Director's Cut.

Disc two contains the ""Alien"" supplemental materials. As with all four film-specific bonus discs, it is divided into three categories: Pre-Production, Production, and Post-Production. Within each category of each bonus disc, there is a plethora of documentaries, featurettes, multi-angle sequences, poster galleries, and still galleries. Among the things I liked best here were a thirty-one minute segment on ""Creature Design""; an eighteen-minute segment on ""Developing the Story""; a series of seven deleted or extended scenes; and a fourteen-minute bit on casting, ""Truckers in Space."" Various cast members contribute their input via recent interviews. In all, there are about two dozen different bonus items on disc two.

Disc three contains the 1986 theatrical version of ""Aliens"" (137 minutes) and the 1991 Special Edition (154 minutes). In addition, it contains a brief introduction by director James Cameron, in which he admits to liking the Special Edition better than the original because he thinks it's ""more intense""; an audio commentary with Cameron, producer Gale Anne Hurd, ""Alien"" effects creator Stan Winston, visual effects supervisors Dennis and Robert Skotak, miniature effects supervisor Pat McChung, actors Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Lance Henriksen, Jenette Goldstein, Carrie Henn, and Christopher Henn; plus optional deleted-footage markers for the Special Edition.

Disc four contains the ""Aliens"" supplemental materials. Among the many features here, I enjoyed ""Preparing for Battle: Casting and Characterization,"" seventeen minutes; ""Beauty and the Bitch,"" a twenty-two minute featurette; and ""The Power of Real Tech"" on visual effects, twenty-six minutes. Altogether, there are about twenty-three bonus items on disc four.

Disc five contains the 1992 theatrical version of ""Alien 3"" (114 minutes) and the 2003 Special Edition (144 minutes). In addition, it contains an audio commentary with cinematographer Alex Thomson, editor Terry Rawlings, ""Alien"" effects designers Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff, Jr., visual effects producer Richard Edlund, and actor Paul McGann; plus optional deleted-footage markers for the Special Edition. No participation from director David Fincher, though. It's the only major ingredient the set lacks.

Disc six contains the ""Alien 3"" supplemental materials. Among the best segments here are ""Xeno-Erotic: H.R. Giger's Redesign,"" ten minutes; ""Adaptive Organism: Creature Design,"" twenty minutes; and ""Optical Fury: Visual Effects,"" twenty-three minutes. In all, there are about twenty-four separate items on disc six.

Disc seven contains the 1997 theatrical version of ""Alien Resurrection"" (109 minutes) and the 2003 Special Edition (116 minutes). In addition, it contains a brief introduction by director Jean-Pierre Jeunet; an audio commentary with director Jean-Pierre Jeunet, editor Herve Schneid, ""Alien"" effects creators Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff, Jr., visual effects supervisor Pitof, conceptual artist Sylvain Despretz, and actors Ron Perlman, Dominique Pinon, and Leland Orser; plus optional deleted-footage markers for the Special Edition.

Disc eight contains the ""Alien Resurrection"" supplemental materials. Here I enjoyed ""French Twist: Direction and Design,"" twenty-six minutes; ""Death from Below: Underwater Photography,"" thirty-one minutes; and ""A Matter of Scale: Miniature Photography,"" twenty-two minutes. In all, disc eight holds about eighteen different bonus items.

Disc nine contains the miscellaneous supplemental materials on all four movies, the best of which is the 2001 ""Alien Evolution"" documentary, which in a little over an hour covers just about everything you'd ever want to know about the making of ""Alien."" For instance, director Scott admits his movie was inspired in part by ""2001"" and in part by ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" According to creature designer Carlo Rambaldi, ""Ridley Scott firmly believed that the more you see of the monster, the less frightening it becomes."" Exactly, which is why the first movie is scarier than the rest. The disc also contains shorter bits on the other movies, plus a whole lot of trailers, teasers, and TV spots; and, for the benefit of laser-disc lovers, all the bonuses found on the laser discs of ""Alien"" and ""Aliens."" Finally, disc nine contains a gallery of ""Alien"" covers from the ""Dark Horse"" comic book series and a feature on Bob Burns's collection of ""Alien"" props and figures.

Parting Thoughts:

Assigning an overall ""Film Value"" rating to this set is a delicate task. If one takes into account the last two films, the rating would be much lower, so I'm ignoring them. My final 9/10 rating is based on the first two movies only and on the comprehensive nature of the extras.",1133827200,9,23213,4.981926155435064

Disc 1 - ALIEN

Wow, what a good movie.  Very atmospheric and scarey.  The Director's Cut is still good, but no match for the original cut.

Disc 2 - The Beast Within: The Making of Alien

There are so much extras on this disc that it gives me a headache.  You know that there's enough special features when you haven't looked at them all after two years.

Disc 3 - ALIENS

My favorite movie of all time.  Awsome characters, great storyline.  The Special Edition has some great stuff added into it, but the original will always be the greatest movie ever.

Disc 4 - Superior Firepower: The Making of Aliens

We couldn't ask for more extra features for this movie.  There are some excellent interviews and other things on the documentary.

Disc 5 - Alien 3

I love this movie, and I like the Special Edition alot.  They're both good and I don't know which one is better.  David Fincher needs to say something about this movie instead of being a wimp and ignoring it.

Disc 6 - The Making of Alien 3

They skimped out on some stuff for the documentary because of all the bad talk about 20th Century Fox.  There's still alot of extra things on this disc that will satisfy fans.

Disc 7 - Alien Resurrection

I really hate this movie, and I hate the Special Edition as well, but I can't lie that the new opening is interesting to watch.

Disc 8 - One Step Beyond: The Making of Alien Resurrection

I can't lie.  This disc has alot of interesting stuff on it compared to how bad the movie is.  It's a worthwhile look into the making of the movie.  At least some of the people are honest and say that they don't like it.

Disc 9 - Alien Quadrilogy

Wow, the laserdisc archive is worth it alone.  Bob Burns is one of the coolest guys ever.  The trailers are so sweet.  We get all the Alien comic book covers on DVD-ROM.  Awsome...

1956695,5,B0000VCZK2,"'Alien' while technically science fiction is also one of the greatest horror/suspense movies ever made. Ridley Scott is now one of the most well known and successful directors in Hollywood, but I don't think anything he's made in the last ten years is a patch on this perfect film, which is a near masterpiece in my opinion. In fact, on reflection there are only three Scott movies I genuinely like, those being his first three. The last of these 'Blade Runner' was released twenty years ago now, so to me Scott is long past his use by date. Whatever, 'Alien' itself is a brilliant piece of work, and is almost flawless. Scott's direction is superb and everything else about it is outstanding - a strong script from Dan O'Bannon et al, an evocative score from Jerry Goldsmith, brilliant design and special effects, including the amazing contributions from H.R.Giger, all add up to an amazing movie experience. I also really liked how the cast were character actors and not ""stars"" so there was plenty of suspense generated as to who will live and who will die. This is something very few subsequent movies have done, 'Pitch Black' being one of the exceptions. Sigourney Weaver may be an icon as Ripley now, but when the movie was first released she was virtually unknown, having had a small cameo in Woody Allen's 'Annie Hall' and not much else. The rest of the cast are equally as good. I especially enjoyed Yaphet Kotto ('Blue Collar') and the legendary Harry Dean Stanton ('Wise Blood') as the wise cracking ""below deck"" crew. Many people seem to prefer James Cameron's sequel 'Aliens' over this, but as I much prefer horror and suspense movies to action ones I think this is definitely the better movie, and still the strongest and most effective in the series. 'Alien' is a horror classic and an absolutely unforgettable movie that I can't recommend highly enough. If you haven't seen it before watch it immediately!

I would argue that ALIENS far surpasses its celebrated predecessor in almost every aspect. Obviously the sheer spectacle of what is basically a Vietnam war movie in space is particularly awe-inspiring - the impressive sets, the many excitingly-staged combat sequences, the aliens themselves (interestingly enough, although through fast cutting and appropriate camera placement it seems as though there are hundreds of aliens being blasted to kingdom come - or else picking off the gung-ho marines one by one - in reality no more than 6 aliens are ever seen in any one shot). But the human drama element of this sequel is also greatly heightened, primarily by the introduction of ""Newt"" (wonderful little Carrie Henn, in her only film role), who turns out to be the sole survivor of recent events on LV-426, becoming a kind-of surrogate daughter to Ripley, which leads to several touching moments and gives the story a surprisingly effective emotional core in the midst of all the otherwise pre-eminent carnage.

The one thing that all fans of the Alien series notice about this movie is the glaring flaw at the very beginning of the film. The egg...how did it get on the Sulaco? An easy answer is the queen, but most people consider that impossible and refuse to accept it as an explanation. So here is my explanation (like it or not, I really don't care...I'm just doing this for fun): While Ripley was rescuing Newt, before Bishop started circling (you'll remember at the end of Aliens she thought he left her, when in fact he was circling because the platform became shaky and unstable), an alien sneaked onto the rescue ship with two eggs (yes, two, despite the fact that only one was shown at the beginning of Alien, which explains how the face-hugger got two beings--two different eggs mean two different face-huggers), hid them, and immediately left the ship. Soon after, the eggs open and the face-huggers leave the rescue ship and search the Sulaco until they find the sleeping survivors. And there you have it, my simple explanation. Point is, they never explain to you what happened, so you have to use your imagination. And if you can get over the flawed beginning, it's actually a pretty good film. It's too bad about the scenes that were reportedly cut (see ""alternate versions"") though. They would have made a good movie great. Overall, not as good as its predecessors, but definitely worthy of being the third (and what should have been the final) chapter in the Alien series.

Alien: Resurrection is the long awaited fourth instalment in the Alien series. Alien3, Alien: Resurrection's predecessor didn't do too well with the critics. And neither did this movie. But, in fact, I liked it. The script may be clunky at times but still planned well by writer Joss Whedon and the feeling of total unrealistic cheese is there sometimes, unlike the first two Alien movies where it really felt like it was happening. But, Alien: Resurrection is so irresistibly entertaining and full of energy that you can't really dislike it too much. It's entertaining, loud and unashamed of what it is - a good piece of Friday night entertainment. The atmosphere is incredibly tense and the characters all bring up plenty of surprises. Even if the performances aren't perfect and the story isn't oh-so-original, there is a thrilling underwater chase through a kitchen and some awesome alien effects and make-up, which make the movie cool enough for me to watch twice! Put together on an impressive DVD box set, this is essential science fiction entertainment.",1119916800,4,5478,4.881847475832438
1956696,5,B0000VCZK2,"I had been salivating over this boxed set since it came out until recently.  I just broke down and paid the monstrous price tag and I am so glad that I did.  The content in this collection is more than any Alien fan could ask for.  EXTRAS, EXTRAS, EXTRAS!  Boy, are there extras!  One of the big reasons for me (but not the only reason) to get this set (aside from the extras) is the inclusion of an alternate version of Alien 3.  The Special Edition version is the definitive version and is far superior to the original theatrical release.  The opening sequences are more fleshed out and that silly chest bursting scene at the end has been removed.  Much of the footage added to this release makes the movie feel...well...more like a movie that deserves to stand up next to the first two Alien installments.  God bless David Fincher because I know it was hell making this movie.  Even though he wanted no part in this ""beefed up"" version, it's far better than the original cut.  Ok, there's only one, and I mean only one drawback to this set and that is the packaging (I refuse to take points off for this because the collection itself is so wonderful).  The outside slipcase/box is just beautiful.  But, when I pulled out the inside fold-out box I was mortified.  It seems like you unfold and flip for days before you finally have the darn thing open (and it's a mile long when you finally do).  I think 2-disc slim cases for each film would have made for a better packing choice.  They would have slipped into the lovely outside box just nicely.  What's so silly about the whole thing is you have to undo the entire fold-out box just to get to the movie you want to watch.  Oh well, this set is immaculate in every other way and should be sitting proudly on every Alien fan's shelf.  Go ahead and pay the hefty price tag and just shake it off.

ALIEN: Definitely the most skilled production of the four. Ridley Scott is no fool and his approach of encapsulating so much of our fears in the form of the Alien is masterful. This is what irritated me so much about Alien v Predator. Whoever directed that had no concept of what it means to be subtle. If you look at Scott's rendering, the Alien is hardly ever seen. It is virtually always hidden in part in darkness, which adds so much more mystery and terror to its existence. DEFINITELY A MUST BUY!  10/10

ALIENS: JAmes Cameron has a completely different take on how to tackle the Alien as humankind's other. Instead of making a gothic, horror-like film, Cameron opts instead for the action-adventure one, reminisant of his Terminator films. He masterfully delays the suspense and the first view of the Alien itself comes only HALF WAY into the film. INCREDIBLE! 9/10

ALIENS 3: Fincher's production has been severly criticised by many people, though I can't see why. The yellow-brown hazy colours and the sense of the audience seeing through the eye of the Alien itself is INCREDIBLE. I thought this film was very well made! 9/10

ALIEN RESSURECTION: Outstanding special effects but the film loses much of its former glory in Jeunet's hands. When I first heard about it I thought "" In Aliens 3, Riply hurls herself into a pool of LAVA!! - but trust hollywood to come up with a sequel to even that"". The film is not as bad as everyone makes it out to be but it certainly reads like a bit of a jumble sale with the odd good scene here and there. AVERAGE but STILL WORTHY OF BEING ADDED TO THE SET 6/10",1114041600,4,1827,4.507552870090635
1956700,5,B0000VCZK2,"I wrote reviews for the seperate Alien DVDs describing the new footage.  Now, here is my review for all the Alien films.

ALIEN: This film is one of the greatest sci-fi films since 2001: A Space Odyssey and horror films since the Exorcist and the orginial Psycho. And this is Ridley Scott's best film to date (Gladiator was excellent too, don't get me wrong) this film started a legacy that will continue for centuries to come. The story is about seven space miners who find a mysterious planet (which is later named LV-426) and later go off to investigate. Then, one of the crewmembers (Kane) goes down a tunnel and ends up with a facehugger on his face. Little do they know that this facehugger has planted an Alien embryo inside of Kane. Then, after the chestburster erupts from Kane's chest, the merciless Alien kills five other crew members (well actually four, one was an android protecting the Alien so the crewmembers killed the android) and changed the life of the seventh forever. This outstanding, groundbreaking film made millons at the box office and earned itself an Oscar for Best Visual Effects. The new DVD has two versions of the film: The orginial theatrical version, and a new ""Director's Cut"". Personally, like all other people, I don't mind this new Director's Cut. Ridley Scott reedited this version with exceptional skill, and the 4 1/2 minutes of new footage is easy to spot, but the 5 minutes of footage he edited out from the theatrical version is tough to spot. Still, the Theatrical Version is slightly better. It is 47 seconds longer than the Director's Cut.

Theatrical Version Rating: 9/10
Director's Cut Rating: 9/10

ALIENS: James Cameron's Alien vision is super intense, suspenceful, and matches everything ALIEN matched in the sci-fi genre. 57 years have passed since the destruction of the Nostromo, and Ripley now joins Colonial Marines to destroy the Alien species for good. This film earned 7 Oscar Nomnations inculding Best Actress (Sigourney Weaver), an incredible feat for a sci-fi film.  This film is the film in which Sigourney Weaver gave her best performance by far in any of her films she starred in. This DVD is the DVD debut for the theatrical version of this film, and it also contains the Special Edition, with 17 minutes of extra footage, making the film flawless in all ways.  The Special Edition of ALIENS is the best posible version of the film- because it has more action, suspense, story, and most importantly- character development. But that doesn't mean the theatrical version isn't worth watching. The theatrical version is outstanding- the special edition is classic. A must for sci-fi buffs.

Theatrical Version Rating: 9/10
Special Edition Rating: 10/10

ALIEN 3: The third film the the ALIEN QUADRILOGY is far worse than the last two- but still good. This film does not have the one-two punch of ALIEN and ALIENS, but has good performances by most of the characters, but a definite feeling of deja-vu hangs over the proceedings. The mediocre FX, the fact that director David Fincher shamelessly ignored the orginial Alien design (well at least they said it was different- but never gave a reason why in the film) and a nearly endless chase down a seemingly endless amount of tunnels. Still, a few scares are in this film, and other good things too. This film is the goriest, most violent, and most profane ALIEN film. The DVD of this film has two versions of the film: the theatrical version and the never before seen special edition (formerly known as the Assembly Cut or Workprint Version) this version adds 40 minutes of deleted, extended and alternate scenes to the film, extending its orginial run time from 114 minutes to 144 minutes. The Special Edition is better than the theatrical version because it makes more sense than the theatrical. If you watch both versions, and compae them, you'll see why. ALIEN 3 takes place in a prison facility that Ripley, Hicks, Newt and the destroyed android Bishop land in after two Alien eggs were laid, once attached itself to Ripley's face, and the other (to a dog in the theatrical version, and an ox in the special edition). This prison facility is a maximum security prison full of male inmates, a company man, a medical officer, and the warden. Ripley survives, and Newt and Hicks get killed. Then, the Alien bursts from an animal's chest and runs amok.

Theatrical Version Rating: 6/10
Special Edition Rating: 7/10

ALIEN RESURRECTION: The fourth and final ALIEN film is the worst of the four, but it's not that bad, since the monster effects are superb, but the film itself, has far too many plot holes, wisecracks and a script written by Joss Whedon- the worst script writer ever. The acting is OK- and the story stinks. Overall- it's OK- but is still the worst of the four ALIEN films. This film was directed by Jean-Pierre Jenuet- and he has little skill in the sci-fi genre. This DVD has two versions: The theatrical version and the improved uncut special edition, with 12 minutes (I think) inculding an alternate opening and ending and extensions of other scenes, making the films orginial running time 109 minutes to 116 minutes. This version is a little better, and I like the orginial opening much more than the theatrical opening. Jean-Pierre Jeunet only cared about the film critic's reviews from France, not the United States.

Theatrical Version Rating: 5/10
Special Edition Rating: 6/10

Overall Rating for all 8 Versions of all 4 films: 7.5/10

Extras: There are SO MANY extras in this set, i will just put it this way: each film gets it's own three-hour documentary. On the movie discs, you will get commentaries for all four films for both versions of each film. Ridley Scott, Sigourney Weaver and others provide the commentary for ALIEN. (Unfortunately, this was the only ALIEN film Weaver did a commentary for.) for ALIENS, James Cameron and others do a commentary. For ALIEN 3, David Fincher didn't participate in doing the commentary (I don't blame him). Editor Terry Rawlings (he was also was the editor for ALIEN) and others inculding Lance Henriksen do a commentary for ALIEN 3. For ALIEN RESURRECTION, Jean-Pierre Jenuet and others do a commentary.

1956701,5,B0000VCZK2,"(Note:  This review covers just the set itself, not a review of each movie).

Wow, this thing is frigging huge!  Don't be fooled by the innocent looking picture of the box.  This set unfolds...and unfolds...and unfolds until it's almost six feet long.  It has all the alien movies (except for ""Alien vs Predator"") with two versions of each movie, the bonus disks for each movie, and a bonous disk that contains lots of leftover, but still fascinating extras, including all the material from the origional ""Alien"" Laserdisk.  If you're looking for a comprehensive set of the Alien movies, this is probably your best bet.

A special note must go to the box itself.  Each section of the foldouts shows noteworthy moments from each Alien movie, such as various alien poses, charachter shots, and action bits.  The main colors here are black and dark metalic green, which suits the atmosphere of the movies really well.

I must say that this is a great bargin.  Get all four Alien movies (two versions each), along with bonus material for each movie, and a bonus disk with hours of stuff to pour through.  However, be sure you're a really big fan of the series, because this set is not cheap.  It's really expensive, but in my opinion it's well worth it (but I am a die-hard fan, so i'd be happy to buy it anyway).",1110931200,,1309,4.6147186147186146
1956702,5,B0000VCZK2,"Dissappointed by last summer's mediocre ""Alien Vs. Predator?""  Then you may want to pick up this boxed set and remind yourself of how truly great the ""Alien"" movie franchise was before the Hollywood bean counters opted to resurrect this concept via the ""Freddy vs. Jason"" route.

Believe all the hype you've heard or read about this boxed set.  Not only is it all it's cracked up to be but it's actually even better than that.  Between the set's nine(count 'em nine)discs there are enough featurettes, documentaries, shooting scripts, storyboards, photo galleries, and other extras to keep you busy not just for several hours but for several days.

In fact, I've read some reviews that claim that this boxed set is almost too much to take in. Don't believe that.  This definitely one case where there's no such thing as too much of a good thing.  If you take your time and peruse the set's offerings over several days you'll see that it literally offers a wealth of entertainment.

This set's best offerings are the special editions of each of the four Alien films.

Suprisingly, it's the special editions of ""Alien 3"" and ""Alien 4"" that prove to be the most interesting and fun to watch.  The ""Alien"" special edition received a much ballyhooed theatrical release in 2003.  While interesting to watch, the original theatrical release remains the stronger version.  The reincorporated deleted scenes don't add to the film's impact.  There is also the scene with a cocooned Dallas, that actually conflicts with the Alien Queen continuity that was established by ""Aliens"" and continued with the other two sequels and ""Alien vs. Predator.""

As for the ""Aliens"" special edition, it's been available for years on laser disc and DVD and therefore offers nothing hardcore fans haven't seen before.

By contrast, the special edition of ""Alien 3"" emerges as a real revelation.  The added and reworked scenes result in a film that is vastly different and ultimately superior to what was shown in theaters.  The only downside is that, unlike Ridley Scott, James Cameron, and Jean-Pierre Junet, ""Alien 3"" helmer David Fincher didn't provide a commentary or participate in post-production interviews for this boxed set.

At least, we do get surprisingly candid interviews from actors and production staff associated with this flawed classic.  This allows us to see how this film was troubled almost from the very beginning.

The ""Alien Resurrection"" special edition is less of a revelation but is still noteworthy for alternate beginning and opening scenes.

All in all, this is quite possibly the best film franchise boxed set ever produced and is a must for Alien fans.",1110412800,,2657,5.02054794520548
1956703,5,B0000VCZK2,"Unlike Friday the 13th which has tons of sequels mainly for milking, the Alien series was made with installments hoping to continue what could be a long running series. Halfway through it fell apart despite some genius scenes. Fox packaged all 4 films including special edition type films, and many other goodies for a set that is just massive to get through.

Alien(1979): Ridley Scott directed the first one which is my second favorite. It had a really slow build and what freaks people out about it is the unknown. A creature who can blend into the architecture of the ship and it was a claustrophic and paranoid type of fear, like knowing something's there but not knowing when it'll appear. It has the legendary chestburster scene and Sigourney in those cute panties.

Aliens(1986): James Cameron directed this one and it's my favorite. Again slow build but this one is more intense. More action and combat driven, arguably a gorier chestburster scene, a character's outcome which I can't help but feel sorry for(hint: he's not like his original counterpart) and a cool ending fight. The deleted scenes flesh out Ripley's character more and her relationship with Newt.

Alien 3(1992): David Fincher directed this one and he practically disowns it from his filmography. It's not THAT bad but it does have weak storyline and script problems but it's great visually. The ""alien vision"" in the tunnels is cool but it has oddly bad CG.

Alien Resurrection(1997): Jean-Pierre Jeunet directed this one and it's pretty bad too but the underwater chase is thrilling and the end gore scene is quite brutal but the script just seems too convenient or just odd(200 years for a Ripley clone? Who just happens to have all memories intact? And is pregnant no less?) Plus quite a bit gorier than the others which is interesting cause I always thought the series worked when there wasn't a lot of gore.

There's 9 discs in all, one for each film in it's entirety plus the extended editions and commentaries etc and the 2nd disc delving into the making of the films. The 9th disc is stuff like trailers for each film and extra stuff. I doubt they would make a 5th considering the box office intake and just general lacklusterness of the last 2 but here's hoping it takes it into a good and new direction before it gets stale. But for now, marvel at the first 2, and just try to entertain yourself with the last 2.",1107388800,3,2400,4.718377088305489
1956704,5,B0000VCZK2,"Excellent. Hours and hours of suspenseful entertainment. And that's just the movies (original release & director's cut). There are hours of behind the scenes features and cast interviews. In a way, they take away a bit of the fear the alien inspires. When you see how they do what they do, it's much less creepy, and still, pretty amazing.

I'm really squeamish these days, but for some reason, I still like this series. Maybe because there is less gore (though still some) and more that leads up to the implication of it.

My favorite is Aliens (Alien 2). I just like the Ripley and Newt interaction. Mom protecting her new young. How sweet. (then you see #3...oh no!)

I know ""it's just a movie"" but after watching these movies back to back to back to back (we had an Alien marathon, it was great!), what struck me most was how ""the company"" and these ""aliens"" just ruined this woman's life. And afterlife... so to speak. I wouldn't want some company to have that kind of power over anyone. (but do they anyway to a lesser degree? hmm...)

As for entertainment, if you like Alien (1-4), and you like director's cuts, commentary, behind the scenes ""how they did that"" and ""who did it,"" plus additional goodies like story boards, photos, and whatever easter eggs are present and yet unfound (by me anyway), you just might like this 9 dvd set. A lot.

One minor but important detail... the packaging. Though sleek and quite compact, it isn't the most secure. So be careful when you first open it. Accordion folds and loosely glued plastic holders make it very easy to drop one.",1105660800,,1576,4.614285714285714

It was truely a magical experience and the picture & sound are sensation it's hard believe watching Alien it was made more than 25 years ago! Defintley ahead of it's time. The Set, Design, and Giger's design of the Alien all superb. And ofcourse Aliens is just a joyride of action, not as horrific as Alien, but nonetheless, Cameron is a genius and knows how please an audience.

Why did they leave out the fantastic outdoor scenes in the beginning and most of the religious aspects, which only give you more to think about.

So I had to buy a second one.  For a fan of the Alien mythology I need say no more, you already know, but for the DVD lover....this is the best packaging ever, For the price and its expansive fold out design it's truly a piece of work.  A Christmas present for any sci-fi fan.

  That said, I must admit that I never got to watch the first two, I was simply enthralled by 3 and Resurrection.  Although it's not what Fincher would have made given the freedom, it's as close as we can come.  For anyone who hated three I beg them to give the extended edition a try.  Fincher took a whole lot of muck and did the best that Anyone could.  The story is more in depth, character development is in place....You actually care when Charles Dance gets it, and the visuals, while not quite up to par, it's a workprint, the visuals are fantastically elaborate and visionary.

  Resurrection is in the same boat, the opening and closing of the film make it, with the very first scene you know what you are getting....instead of the surprise for fans when the scary credits led into a French artfilm.  Even if you don't like the developments in the flick you must admit it's quick fun and a great way to spend the evening.  Those were the two that need explaining.  As for the first two, I need say no more.  I own the first two as singles as well and have them both memorized, pretty much that favorite book you don't need to read again but it's great for reference.

Aliens 3 was okay not as good as Aliens 2 but it was not a bad flick, but again there was only one alien and no guns to combat it with. Aliens Ressurrection was darn good with the guns and the way how they explain Ripley's return when she died in th third film, lots of shooting and lots of aliens, but was not as good as Aliens 2 although it did come close to being as good as aliens 2. Overall Aliens Quadrilogy is a must get although I find the first alien film relatively boring, it still is a must get particulary just to complete the collection, but other than that the remaining three are excellent jaw dropping thrillers worth watching over and over again.",1098316800,,1061,4.205882352941177
1956711,5,B0000VCZK2,"(I don't have this set and I haven't see any of the director's cuts. This is for the theatrical versions of the films.)

The Alien Quadrilogy is a collection of four films starring Sigourney Weaver in her star making role as Lt. Ellen Ripley.

Here's is a brief summary over each film.

Alien-a ship of seven crew members gets a S.O.S. from a nearby planet. Three of the crew members go outside to explore and Ripley discovers it is not a S.O.S., but a warning. It is proven that is too late to tell the crew that because Kane(John Hurt),a member of the crew, now has something on his face that if it gets removed he will die. A couple hours later, Kane wakes up feeling great and the creature now off his face. The crew is now having dinner when sudenly Kane starts going crazy. He lays down on the table and an alien comes out of his chest. Soon, it begins to grow and kill off all the passagers. It is now a race against time as the crew tries to get off the ship and get to the escape pod before the alien kills them all. This is one of the best films of the ENTIRE series. Everything is amazing(Acting, Directing, etc.). Overall truly a classic film. You will love it.

Aliens- 57 years have passsed and Ellen Ripley has been found in hypersleep. She has been taken aboard a space station and tries to explain what happen to the crew. Nobody buys the alien story and the case is closed. Ripley tells them check to make sure, but the chief says it is not necessary because the planet has been colonized and there are no reports of aliens. But soon, contact is lost with the colonists and Ripley is asked to find out what went wrong. She will do it on one condition: to wipe the aliens and not have anyone study. They agreed and Ripley, along with a group of marines, sent off for the planet.

When they get there, they meet a young girl named Newt who is the only person still alive because the aliens have killed everyone else. Soon the aliens show their ugly faces and now, it's war! WOW is all I can about this one! This film is the best one, period. Everything has improved and the fight between Ripley in the robot suit and the Alien Queen is amazing. See this one!

Alien3-Ripley crash lands on a prison planet due to an acid spill in the cyrogentics room aboard the ship Surlaco, where she and the other survivors of LV-246, are sleeping in cyrosleep. Soon, she is found by the people who work on the planet and discovers she is the only person who survived the crash on the planet. Newt and Hicks(one of the marines from Aliens and the only Marine who survived Aliens) are now dead because of the crash and Bishop(the android from Aliens) is damaged beyond repair. Ripley soon hears about a death and she knows that a alien is now on the planet. She discovers that this alien was aboard the ship before it crashed.  It turns out this alien had used a dog for the host, thus making this one is much faster than its previous aliens. Ripley must now destroy this alien, along with the prisoners, who have taken up religion, without modern day weapons. She also must now kill herself because she now has an alien inside her, due to the fact another alien got in her cyro-tube and implanted her with one. It is discovered to be an queen, which means if it bursts out of Ripley's chest, not only will she die, but more aliens could be produced. This film goes back to the style of the first. I considered this the weakest film in the series and once you see it, you will most likely, agree.

Alien Resurrection- 200 years have passed and Ripley has been cloned by scientists of the space ship the Auriga. Ripley was cloned with the alien queen inside her. Scientists need more information about the aliens and Ripley, who now has acid blood and abilities like the alien because while she was being cloned she had sex with the Alien Queen(that's how I understand it,anyway),so the scientists get bodies to use as hosts for the aliens. They are  delived by the crew of the Betty, a group of mercenaries. The experiment proves to be  successful and soon the aliens are back to cause some more terror for the people on board the ship. Now Ripley and the crew of the Betty must now escape and get to Earth before they are all killed by the aliens. This is underated. Truly this is better film than 3 (IMO) and is more like Aliens due that is a action film. Still worth checking out, especially for the CGI aliens.

Overall a good collection. I reccomend it!!",1098144000,,4459,4.353790613718411
1956712,3,B0000VCZK2,"After seeing all of the Alien movies, I would have to say that it is not worth getting this pack consisting of all four Alien movies and the extra discs.  The first two Alien movies were the only good ones out of the bunch.  I'd be better to simply buy those two separatly.  The following is my list of elements in each of the movies and reasons why/why not to buy each one.

Content goes on a NONE, MILD, MODERATE, STRONG, and CONSTANT scale.  Rating goes on a 1 to 5 scale.

Alien: R

Blood--STRONG

Language--MODERATE

Nudity--NONE

Scary Images--STRONG

Comments--Good cast, great acting and directing, and good overall original storyline. Occasional swearing (use of ""F"" word), plenty of blood, and the alien itself may be scary to younger viewers.

My Rating: 4.5

Aliens: R

Blood--STRONG

Language--STRONG

Nudity--NONE

Scary Images--STRONG

Comments--Definatly a good choice for actors, director, etc.  The visuals are not too much different than in ""Alien"" but are not bad.  There is still blood and language had been jacked up several notches (use of just about everything).  Still no nudity and aliens may scare younger viewers.

My Rating: 5

Alien 3: R

Blood--STRONG

Language--CONSTANT!

Nudity--NONE

Scary Images--STRONG

Comments--Forgive me those of you who enjoyed this movie, but this one sucked!  The story was fairly weak, the acting was only so-so, and at this point, Ripley has changed way too much for my liking (nothing compared to Alien: Resurrection, however).  Language is existant throughout the ENTIRE film.  Every other word is the ""F"" word.  Totally unnecessary.  No nudity, same for blood, and scary images.  At this point, special effects on the computer were becoming more popular.  This was a mistake.  The alien was sometimes a puppet and sometimes not.  When it was done via computer graphics, it looked terrible.

My Rating: 1

Alien: Ressurection: R

Blood--STRONG

Language--STRONG

Nudity--MILD

Scary Images--STRONG

Comments--WORST ALIEN MOVIE EVER...  There is no excuse as to why this should have been this bad!  The blood and images are still the same, the language has taken a step back, but still fairly strong.  Of course, in 1997 the director had to go along with the ever-increasing trend and add unnecessary nudity.  That really pissed me off.  People these days can't go with making a decent movie.  Although it's not sex, Ripley becomes a little revealing during the beginning of the film.  The alien design is the only good thing in the movie.  Much scarier for little kids, but awesome looking.  However, the movie goes back to its poor-quality state when they introduce the ""new alien"" at the end of the movie. It simply defies all rules and such for the alien movies.  As for the characters, Ripley is no longer the Ellen Ripley that we worried about in ""Alien"" or cheered on in ""Aliens"".  I don't even know what to say.  She just isn't herself.  As for the rest of the cast, they were horrible picks and horrible characters in the first place.

My Rating: 0

Overall, its not worth $80.  Just go out and buy Alien and Aliens alone.  You'll be much more satisfied.",1097366400,4,3127,4.920849420849421

If you watch the films for what they are, most people will like them, and especially the new editions for Alien 3, and Alien Resurrection.

As noted, this collection is packed full of extras, and I thoroughly enjoyed the interviews, especially for Alien 3, and resurrection.

The Studio interference in Alien 3 is very evident, and the original cut is way better than the theatrical mess.

David Fincher had a major problem as director, and that problem was the bean counters at the Studio.

ALIEN is evidence of just what a visionary directory can achieve when given free reign, just as ALIENS is evidence of how a good director can make a film work WELL.

Alien Resurrection is excellent evidence of how a film can be rescued. Juenet has allegedly  said that he did not know why people went to the studio to be scared, well, his version of the film is trash compared to the 2003 cut.

Sadly, this franchise was messed by the studio and showed how ""too many cooks spoil the broth"".

Most importantly, the collection as it is here, shows that the story line is far from fished out, and I feel that an Alien 5 directed and maybe even co-written by Weaver, would be superb.

1956717,4,B0000VCZK2,"The packaging on this DVD set is not perfect, but the abundance of ""Extras"" is astounding.  The interviews and documentaries where incredible, taking their time, and being a very thorough dissection of the events and decisions leading up to the ultimate theatrical releases of each of the movies.  I found the making of Alien and Alien 3 the most interesting of the documentaries.

Of course, I have a bias towards liking the documentary for Alien because it is by far my favorite of the four movies, but Alien 3's was equally interesting because it showed the corporate decisions that hindered the ability for David Fincher, in my opinion one of the great cinematic directors today, from making a movie that could captivate its audience.  True, Alien 3 didn't live up to it's genre expectations-true, it wasn't scary, but it was a visual treat and the mood and desolate atmosphere invoked by the movie is notable.  I think in time, people will come to regard it as an sci-fi art film-certainly not the best Alien film if you're a sci-fi or horror buff, but in my opinion shouldn't be written off as an awful film (and I'm very picky).

The special editions of each of the movies where better than the theatrical releases, except Alien Resurrection which was more interesting than wholly necessary. Although Alien's theatrical release wasn't as good as the special edition, I prefer it because I like the long meandering shots that Ridley had of the ships (notably missing in the SE version) as it adds a emptiness to the feel of the ship-space is supposed to be cold and quiet.

This is my judgement of the four movies (special editions):

1) Alien - Perfect and brilliant.  The new shots of the Alien are great if suttle.

2) Aliens - One of the best action movies ever. The additional scenes interrupt the tension a little and make the movie really long, but still very much enjoyable.

3) Alien 3 - Gothic and somewhat depressing, but is interesting despite not being truly frightening-it's hard to care for murderers and rapists being picked off by a dog-like alien.  Fincher scenes Fincher was forced to take out really helped the movie a great deal.  The SE version is better than the Theatrical Release.

4) Alien 4 - Designed for Teenagers.  This feels the most like a Holliwood movie with one liners that the first Alien movie would dare use-almost a parady of itself.  It makes a good summer flick, but not exactly repeatable, and definitely pales in comparison to the first and second, and even the third.

The Worst parts of all 4 movies put together would still be like Citizen Cane compared the abortion of a movie, Paul Anderson put out this summer ""Alien Vs. Predator""",1095897600,8,2685,4.727467811158799

1956724,5,B0000VCZK2,"Nine discs, four movies, a full day's worth of viewing material, riveting interviews. If, in the future, the compilation of a DVD is remembered as a post-digital art form, than the Alien Quadrilogy (despite its absurd title) will rank alongside the Lord of the Rings Extended Editions as an early masterpiece, a deep burrow into the black heart of this great, horrifying, perplexing, confounding and at times downright odd series. From its pulpy origins to its rise to the level of art at the hands of its charismatic shapers (Ridley Scott, Sigourney Weaver, John Hurt, Ian Holm, the incomprable, though often copied, H R Giger), to its recasting into a durable franchise under the iron hand of ultimate technocrat James Cameron, to its partial undoing in David Finscher's bold, unsatisfying experiment, to its final destruction at the unwitting hands of Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Joss Whedon (two talents which, though individually great, arguably should never have been combined) the story is retold in frequently bitter flashback, very little of the sugar-coating one normally associates with this medium.

Beyond this of course, are the films themselves; each shown in both their original and recut versions.

ALIEN: (theatrical cut) The most nightmarish and genuinely frightening of the quartet, Alien takes full advantage of Giger's contributions, creating a world that straddles the boundary between the logical and the fantastic, a world in which space becomes eternal night, a darkness in which our deepest and most primal thoughts lie concealed. With a cast of genius actors, brilliant pace and hugely effective editing, this is a masterclass in horror filmmaking.

(director's cut) This is one cut too many on an already perfect gem. The now-legendary ""pod scene"" with Dallas notwithstanding, there is little added of any interest, and quite a lot taken away. Extra scenes are weighted toward the end, which skews the original's perfect pacing.

Aliens: (theatrical cut) Another flawless steel contraption by master technician James Cameron, this film, though radically different from its predecessor in tone, actually dovetails with it perfectly. Confident enough to not need Giger (Cameron himself designed this film's addition to the mythos, the Queen) this story shies away from Freudian sexual terror and focuses on maternal love, human and monstrous, while the relentless direction connects straght to our adrenal glands, leaving us too exited to fear.

(director's cut) As with all films by Cameron, any alteration made at the insistence of a studio is a detraction. The restored material enhances the the story's themes and provides Weaver with an emotional focus around which to weave her character.

Alien 3 (theatrical cut): As slow, cold and desolate as the wasteland it takes place on, this film has few friends, though perhaps unfairly. Much of the plot seems incomprehensible at first viewing, and the artistic decision to leave Ripley bereft and longing for death turned many away. But I would say that Alien 3 ultimately anchors the trilogy, and, in a strange way, defines it. Looking back, there could never have been a happy ending for Ripley; her fate is tied to that of the Aliens. Her purpose in life is to protect her kind from them. She made that choice when she blew up the Nostromo.

(workprint edition)With much of the plot restored and the characters enhanced, Alien 3 emerges in the workprint edition as a complete film. Whereas the original cut was disjointed and vague, the restored material restores crucial plot points and character development. This is far and away the better of the two, and the most significant recut of the set.

Alien Resurrection: A mess despite the talent that concocted it. Essentially a new beginning for the series, with a new character (the Ripley clone is now part Alien herself, and therefore her ties to her species are not as binding as her donor's), this film sits uneasily between superficial action flick and the profound implications of its antcedents. Jean-Pierre Jeunet injects his ""nightmare circus"" mentality into the Alien universe, and one can only wonder what would have followed had he had a better script to work from.

(director's cut) Actually worse than the theatrical, with a number of bad jokes restored, a perplexing and downbeat ending on what appears to be a post-apocalyptic Earth, and a strange and unneccessary beginning.",1092441600,8,4418,5.185133239831697

1956726,5,B0000VCZK2,"This collection of all four of the Alien movie series really does an excellent job of really compiling a very uneven movie franchise and packing it up onto one amazing, if imperfect, set with each of the individual movies having their original versions as well as ?Special Editions? of each one, with a ninth disc, and the result is a downright awesome DVD set.

ALIEN (1979): This Ridley Scott directed classic broke so much new ground when it was released. A team of deep space pioneers are returning home from earth when a mysterious signal on a desolate planet is received by the crew aboard the ship Nostromos. When they are sent in to investigate where this mysterious signal came from, they have no idea of the horrors that they will find themselves up against. This one is incredibly groundbreaking and is very suspenseful. The special effects are extremely dated though but this is still a powerful sci-fi classic.

ALIENS (1986): This one is easily the best one in my catalog. I can easily remember how much this movie scared me to death when it was released when I was only a toddler. In this one, Ripley is in cryogenic suspension for over 57 years and when she is awaked after all of that time, she is told that the planet that she escaped from after killing the alien there has been colonized. However, as the colony began to flourish, contact is suddenly lost?.completely?..and now a team of Space Marines is sent in with Ripley being the ?advisor? to the team and to rescue any possible survivors, but then realize that Ripley?s main enemy species has made it?s nest there and now they must destroy the nest and the aliens there and escape?if they can. This is easily my favorite of the bunch because of so many things. The acting is almost perfect by everyone. James Cameron?s directing is his best he?s ever done and the special effects even by 1980s standards are absolutely amazing and hardly even show their age.

ALIEN 3 (1992): This one to me is one of the most unfairly criticized and underrated classics of all time. At the same time though, I sometimes felt troubled at some of the things that happened in this film in the beginning. Ripley finds herself on a planet after an alien in fact laid an egg onboard the spachship that she, Hicks and Newt were on and where the Queen Alien was defeated. An acid spill causes an electrical fire which causes the escape pod to detach and Ripley is the only survivor once again after the pod crashes into the ocean of a desolate planet where dangerous prisoners are held in a high-security facility called Fury 161. The prisoners however along with Ripley are being hunted by a much deadlier breed Alien like no other and they have No weapons to fight the creature. Ripley herself finds out that her biggest nightmare has come true and that the alien isn?t her only enemy anymore. I?ve always had mixed feelings towards this movie. The most troubling were that two of my favorite characters from the previous one are killed off and it was really depressing. The biggest problem I had with this was that it used the F-Bomb too much. A few such bombs are fine from time to time but sheesh, cut down on them please! Otherwise, this movie is nonetheless a strong entry. The extended cut of this is light years better and replaces some footage from the original version and replaces it while adding previously unreleased footage and extending the movie by over 30 minutes. The result is a much improved version that while deeply flawed no matter what, makes it a lot better than before.

ALIEN RESURRECTION (1997): Easily my least favorite of the bunch, I nonetheless find it enjoyable to some extent due to it?s awesome special effects and action sequences. 200 years after Ripley?s passing, scientists from the company that wanted to quarantine the creature have managed to acquire both it and Ripley?s DNA and cloned both of them. The Alien species that her ?ancestor? had fought hard to destroy forever is now heading towards humanity?s home planet Earth and if the Alien makes it there, it could spell catastrophe for humanity. I?ve always had mixed opinions about this movie back when it was released and still do to this day. I?ve always felt that this was more like some kind of spinoff of some sort rather than the continuation of the Alien Saga but it interesting to take into account cloning her even if the samples have survived for over 200 years exposed to the elements. The acting except by Weaver herself of course was hammy and really dogged this movie. Easily the weakest but nonetheless enjoyable but only for Alien die-hards. For everyone else, the first three are more than satisfactory",1091750400,2,4668,4.689024390243903
1956727,5,B0000VCZK2,"The Alien Quadrilogy is the most amazing box set ever created,  if you over look the cheap packaging that is trouble to unfold and lets hair and dust in.  I have heard complaints from other costomers that the disks are scratched and of poor quality, however I did not encounter this problem, but I'm not at all surprised.  The set is expensive-yes, poorly packaged-yes, worth it-yes.  This set gives you two versions of every movie (Alien 3's is espetially good) and each movie has a second disk with the making of featurettes, as well as, of course a cheezy ninth disk thrown in there (hey, im not complaining!)and a manual (however if you're one of those major Alien fans with way too much time on your hands, like me, you will find the manual leaves out characters and has Raines and Junior, from alien 3, mixed up). You also need to be 18 to buy the set or else you need to take yaw mommie wiff you (thank you so much movie advisory board!).  However once you get the set home it is the most rewarding experience to unfold the set to reveal over FIVE FEET of great Alien DvD's (and cheap plastic and cardboard casing help together by cheap glue). But it isn't the packaging that makes a movie pack, its the movies, and every DvD is worth it! They are the greatest DvD's for you Alien fans with so much extra crap that you could sit there watching it for 96 hours strait, going through each movie, its alternit version, its making of featurettes, its galleries, more featurettes for the first alien, more art, picture, storyboard and script galleries, and MORE!  Man, I'll never get bord of this set, I think I'll go watch the Alien 3 Special Edition! Bye! Oh, no Junior don't sacrifice yourself!  Run you fools! hahahahahahahaaaaa! Woohoo you can really hear the blood splatter!",1091145600,3,1782,4.55
1956728,5,B0000VCZK2,"If you are a fan of the Alien saga, or a buyer of blockbuster movies, you must have this collection. Not only are the extras (see the Amazon review by Dalkin for all the technical details  including; documentaries, commentaries, storyboards, illustrations and post-production notes) what you would expect from any serious DVD package these days, you also get two versions of each movie.
It is an interesting exercise to compare the different versions of each film. Alien Resurrection isn't altered much, and the director's cut of Alien is inferior to the theatrical version. Cameron's director's cut of Aliens enhances the original while a special edition version of Alien 3 (not endorsed by Fincher) is worth having, despite some flaws with sound and overall quality.
Some reviews have criticised the packaging and quality of the DVD's. My DVD's were in perfect condition with no scatches or glitches while playing. These complaints may be related to a certain batch, and couldn't possibly be typical of the product.
While the packaging isn't brilliant, these criticisms should not disuade any prospective buyer. If you take care it should last. But really, who buys a DVD package for the cardboard?
As I wrote above, if you are a fan of the series you must have this product. I also recommend collectors of box sets to invest in this superior product. I doubt the Alien saga box set can or will be improved upon in the future. This is the ultimate edition, despite a slightly cheap package.",1089417600,3,1492,4.944223107569721
1956729,5,B0000VCZK2,"The Alien Quadrilogy [2003] is perhaps the best illustration of how DVD technology has consigned VHS to the dustbin of home entertainment history.  This beautifully packaged boxed set is a splendid illustration of the capabilities of the DVD medium and certainly contains everything you ever wanted to know about Alien - and then some.
The 9 DVDs comprise both the original theatrical releases and extended director's cuts of all 4 movies.  Audio and visuals have been tweaked to a noticeable degree to optimise home enjoyment. If you don't already possess a surround-sound system - buy one now!
The documentary disks accompanying each movie are crammed full of fascinating material - storyboards, backstage candid shots and tons of insightful and amusing interviews with the directors, producers, actors etc. One of the highlights for me  being the Aliens 3 supplemental disk, which recounts the amazing story of the abortive ""wooden monastery"" first draft and the huge problems that beset the third installment.  I wonder if one of the proposed taglines for another draft of Alien 3 - ""On Earth *everyone* can hear you scream"" may yet be used for a 5th movie?  Also, seeing the legendary H.R. Giger at work in his bone-filled mausoleum of a studio was truly captivating.
Everyone is familiar with the movies themselves, so just a few brief words will suffice on each;
Alien: a sublime and seminal blend of intelligent sci-fi and gothic horror. Totally blew me away when I first saw it in '78 and it can still shock and grab you by the guts today.  I prefer the theatrical release, as the extended version lacks a little pace in the denouement due to superfluous scenes - 10/10.
Aliens: Not quite the stunning claustrophobic impact of the first movie, but the breathless action easily compensates. Go for the special edition here for the more meaningful intro and the poignant scene where Ripley finds out about her daughter - 10/10.
Alien 3: Director's cut is *FAR* superior here - why the abbatoir scene and the nascent ""bambi"" alien were cut from the theatrical version is truly baffling. The strongest characterisation and human interest of the entire series, although the ending appears somewhat rushed and is not entirely satisfactory - 8/10.
Alien Resurrection: Generally held to be the weakest of the series (I agree), Jeunet dilutes the alien impact with some whimsical direction and downright annoying characterisation. In places Alien 4 descends, disappointingly, into black comedy. Cult actor Ron Perlman is great though and the alien effects are excellent. Stick with the slicker theatrical version - 6/10.
So, whilst I am not a great fan of the 4th installment, this collection, especially now at this bargain price, undeniably represents excellent value for money and is an indispensible purchase for the serious sci-fi fan.  The Alien Quadrilogy is what DVD systems were made for!",1088899200,3,2897,5.086315789473685
1956730,5,B0000VCZK2,"As a fan of the alien series since I was a child, I can say I am 100% satisfied with this awesome collection. The nine DVD's are packed with the four great movies (with both Widescreen AND fullscreen on each), plenty of extras (probably more than I'll even have time to watch, sadly), and a great case that is small enough to take in the car, on trips, to your friend's house, ect. The extra features are cool, but the movies are where this gets it real luster from. Alien and Alien 3 are more of thrillers/horror movies, and Aliens and Alien Ressurection are more action oriented, but still very creepy. As a warning to people who've never seen a movie in this series, you better not watch this if you have a really weak stomach. These movies are very shocking (and quite graphic). I still remember being shocked as the baby alien ripped out of the guy's stomach.
Alien 10 out of 10. Great movie, very creepy, and very shocking.
Aliens 10 out 10 As I said earlier, more action packed and faster paced than the original, but still pretty creepy.
Alien 3 9.7 out of 10 A very good return to the horror roots of the original (again with only one alien like in the original), but all in all pretty action packed at the end.
Alien Ressurection 9.4 out of 10 Fast paced like in Aliens, and very exciting. I was dissapointed at the ending (I loathed the human-like alien). I liked how they incorporated modern special effects, though.
This series is well-worth owning and is fun to watch time and time again.",1086998400,,1502,4.445652173913044
1956731,4,B0000VCZK2,"Here's the big question regarding the Alien series:  do you spring for the massive 9 disc boxset, or do you save a little cash (and time) by only picking up the two good movies in the series?
Folks, the first two films are inarguably classics of their genres.  But the last two films are pretty disposable.  Especially 3, a movie that just exists for no explainable reason.  If you haven't seen it, consider yourself lucky, as it basically makes mince meat of everything that was great about the first two.  The fourth one is good by comparison, just because there wasn't getting much worse than 3.
Why do we need 9 disc sets?  Why do we need alternate cuts of movies?  I'll tell you, it sure is nice to finally be able to have the vastly superior Theatrical Cut of ""Aliens"" rather than the unnecessarily bloated extended cut.
Two movies are classics, two movies are crap.  But- and this complicates matters- part four is ENTERTAINING crap.  But these features, man- I can't bring myself to wade through three hours of features about a classic, let alone three hours of features for a crappy movie.",1086480000,2,1098,4.618556701030927

1956735,5,B0000VCZK2,"I appreciate the set very much, but I'll leave it to others to express opinions on the 4 movies.
I regret that my relatively new, near-top-of-the-line Pioneer player encounters a fatal error at the layer change in both versions of Alien. I find it interesting that the layer change is at the same point in the dialogue in both versions, which ends up being in different chapters and times because of the different elements of the 2 versions of the movie.
I could get around the problem by pressing fast forward (scan) just before the layer change (after identifying it) and bypassing the ""change."" This is weird, too: why should the player be able to ""skip"" the layer change and continue successfully if I scan, but it can't survive the layer change as it exists on the disc (#1 of 9)?
As usual with a layer change, there's a brief freeze, with ""SEARCH"" displayed on my DVD player. Only instead of the movie continuing, at that point I get a blue (i.e., no-disc-playing) screen that simply says DVD in the upper left. Restarting the disc is necessary. This is a real drag.
Further, disc #4 (the supplemental disc for Aliens) has problems in following the navigation option of going by Pre-Production, Production & Post-Production organization. The menu broke up digitally after the first level, with some submenus being black and causing me to guess what I was selecting. Eventually I stumbled into ""nexting"" between elements and ended up watching everything. Still, out of 9 discs, 2 have problems. I didn't ask to exchange the set because I don't have time to watch the 9 discs all over again (yes, I watched every single item, including still frames, except for some of the original screenplays). And, as I said, I can see all the material now that I've learned the tricks of how to do it.
I'm glad I have the set and glad I watched it all. I just wish I had the peace of mind knowing that all the discs are in perfect condition.",1083283200,9,1932,4.602898550724638

1956737,4,B0000VCZK2,"Finally, some of the greatest movies ever are collected in one huge set, getting the special DVD treatment that they deserve.  2 Discs per movie, with a final special features disc, making up 9 discs in all...what more could you ask for?
Alien gets a great treatment, remastered and extended with some of the scenes originally left on the cutting room floor.  Its the same edition that was played on the big screen in November of 2003.  It kind of slows down the movie just a bit, but its nice to see some more of the plot elements and extra shots of the alien that were left out.  The original movie is also included, and looks great.  The commentary sheds alot of insight into the film and the extras are well worth it.  This is one of the best special treatments in the set.
Aliens is still awesome.  The Special Edition, which has been out for many years, looks better than ever.  Also included is the original theatrical version, though I much prefer the extended edition now.  The commentary and extras are all well worth it, and Aliens still stands out as the best movie in the series, though the debate still rages between Alien and Aliens.
Of all the movies however, I found Alien 3 to be the most intriguing in the set.  After so many years of hearing about it, the 'Workprint Edition' is FINALLY shown.  Adding an extra half hour to the film, Alien 3 takes on a whole new face.  Bloodier, darker, and with completely new plot elements, Workprint edition was definitely an interesting spin on the Alien 3 plot.  The death of Hicks is shown in more unnecessarily gruesome detail(to this day I don't know why they opted to murder him so horribly).  The birth of the alien and prisoner Golic's obsession with it are two of the most notable differences.  There is ALOT of things that they could have left in, but at the same time, I see why they cut alot of it out.  The workprint edition was restored to the best of their ability, but some sound is muffled.  They provided sub-titles for the scenes were the audio is too low to hear, or is being drowned out by background sound.  I would've liked to have seen more of the alien shots that were included in the workprint edition, but the original movie is ok the way it is.  Not all of the workprint material was included either...some brief shots were still cut out.  Overall, this was the most interesting aspect of the set.
Alien: Resurrection is still utter garbage...it's just another 8 minutes of utter garbage, complete with the director rather arrogantly explaining how he thought his movie was a masterpiece and he didn't feel the need to add the deleted footage.  Depiste this, Resurrection is still one of the worst movies ever conceived, and definitely the movie that ruined this series.  I watched it once, and never had a desire to pop it in again.
The discs were all in pristine working condition and nicely decorate.  The extras disc is ok...its mostly promotional material from all the films.  Most of the best stuff is one the individual movie discs themselves.
There is one thing wrong with this set...and as many people pointed out, it is the unbeleivably ridiculous packaging.  You practically need a dining room table to stretch out the entire box and pick which movie you want.  I don't know who the genious was who came up with the packaging, but he/she needs to be smacked about 2 dozen times.  Some of the movies could have had a bit more extras, and maybe cleared up just a bit more, but otherwise everything else is fine.  As for the other criticism I see about this set...the word 'Quadrilogy' not being a real world...who really cares?  I think its more ridiculous to complain about that...you're buying the set for the movies, you aren't buying it to grade it on grammar or turn it in for your doctorate thesis.
Overall, if you're an Alien fan, then you must own this set.  However, I recommend buying each DVD individually and save yourself the trouble of dealing with the ridiculous packaging on this box set.  Each 2 disc movie and the special materials disc can all be bought seperately, so you won't be missing anything. Regardless, get this set!  Alien fans won't regret it!",1080864000,5,4167,4.589189189189189
1956738,5,B0000VCZK2,"ALIEN QUADRILOGY is the most definitive, exhaustingly researched, jam packaged box of ALIEN movies that could ever be assembled.  Hopefully if a fifth one is released, it too can blend right in.  In the box there are four movies and each movie gets two discs.  One with an original theatrical version and the other a ""directors"" or ""special"" edition with added footage.  The second disc for each movie is jam packed with documenteries, script drafts, screen tests, story boards, photo galleries i.e. THE WORKS.  A ninth disc carries what wouldn't fit on the other discs in terms of content.  All of the movies get a facial treatment in the way of remastered picture and sound quality.  (ALIEN in particular stunned me with its bright and clear picture.  The whites are bright, and the blacks are dark.)
ALIEN, my favorite in the series.  Why I like this one the most is it has the best cast, best pacing and the methods that the crew use are more in a mind of science instead of brute force to get rid of the creature.  The 2003 special edition has a few added scenes which are alternate takes for the most part of deleted scenes on the out of print Alien DVD (viewable on the ninth disc).  None of the scenes added really add much save for the infamous ""lost scene"" and some original scenes are even taken out.  At the very least Dallas's line ""I don't trust anybody"" is gone.  Damn that line is old and boring!  Of all of the non theatrical versions, this one is probably the worst and ranks in ""Star Wars"" quality of Special Editions, in other words you'll long for the original after watching it, because not all that much added was all that special.
ALIENS is a pure combat movie by James Cameron and is probably the most popular of the 4 movies.  The special ediiton here has been around for awhile and for the first time the original version is here on DVD as well.  The Special Ediiton this time is clearly the better film because it seamlessly adds to the story without compromise or distraction and is a basis for how extended special editions should be done.
ALIEN 3 is the [an illegitimate child] child of the four.  Now famous director David Fincher (the skunk wouldn't even do a commentary and reportadly walked out before the movie was done) had problems with changing scripts, changing storys in other words nothing worked the way it should have and turned into a mess.  The Special Edition here is supremely better then the original with a story that makes a little more sense and shows that with some work, bad or underappreciated movies can get a second chance.  You'll never watch the theatrical version again after this one.
ALIEN RESURECTION wasn't all that great when I first saw it.  After watching it again, it's improved marginally.  What started out showing the thought and splendor of the first movie unfortunatly turns into ""more of the same"" by the end.  The special edition doesn't add a whole lot but what is there is worth seeing.
Before there was two great and two lousy ALIEN movies.  There are still two great ones, 3 gets promoted to ""decent"" and Reserection, well is less lousy.  Get them all in this great set.

1956740,4,B0000VCZK2,"OK let me start off by saying these movies are awesome. I would of given it a five but Alien Resurrection was what stopped me.(read on I'll explain).

Alien (1979)
  This movie was very good. It had the horror, the suspense, and the question ""what next"".The scene with the chestburster was pure originality. It is about a ship with 8 crew members who are in hyper sleep and on their way home. They are then woken up by a distress call and go to a foreign planet to check it out. Little did they know this was a warning not a distress call.  I give it a 9/10.

Aliens (1986)
  Even though the first was great this was much better. It has way more action, much more suspense, AND MOST IMPORTANT MORE ALIENS (INCLUDING THE QUEEN).In this movie Ripley is picked up by a spaceship where later she finds she's been asleep for 57 years. She then accompanies a military group to go to the alien planet to kill them all. Little does she know this is probably the biggest adventure she has ever faced.
  I give this a 10/10 (best of the series)

Alien 3 (1992)
  This is definitely the darkest of the series. I find it to be pretty good. It's a little slow at the beginning but it gets fast paced later on. In this one Ripley's ship crashes on a prison planet. She later finds out that the crash was caused by an alien who got on bored. She finds that all 25 men on the planet are all rapest and very religious and must be very careful around them. Nobody believes her about the alien that is on the planet and they find it to be true when they get picked off one by one. Then Ripley finds out that the Queen alien is IMPLANTED in side of her and will die. She is determined to kill the alien and then herself to save mankind.
  This movie is decent and gets an 8/10.

Alien Ressurection (1997)
  This movie was a disappointment to me. I hated the way Ripley was so close to the aliens especially at the end when she cry's as her ""child""(the alien)gets sucked out of the ship. In the Fourth installment of the Quadrilogy Ripley is cloned(since she dies in the 3rd one) so scientist can get the alien out of her to breed and study. While she looks the same she has quality's like an alien(acid blood,temper,super strength). She then says she is the mother of the aliens. The aliens get loose and she must try to stop them with the help of the crew members.
  I find this the worst of the series and it's lucky to even get the score I'm giving it 6/10.

If Resurrection was better i would of given the set 5 stars. See for yourself.",1079308800,3,2520,4.210416666666666
1956741,4,B0000VCZK2,"...if I had it to do all over again, I believe I would have bought the movies one 2-disc set at a time rather than all at once in this box set.
Buying the box set is a bit easier on the bank account, and there is a bonus 9th DVD that can't be had any other way...but the 9th disc is more of an appendix and even the most hardcore ""Alien"" fan probably won't watch it more than once.
The problem I have with the box set isn't its content; the alternative versions of each movie alone make this latest reissue absolutely necessary...and as each episode in the series has an entire separate DVD's worth of bonus features, a viewer can literally spend an entire weekend watching a single movie.
However, the box set's composition is a serious let-down.  Its design means that it must be ceremoniously unfolded each time a disc is viewed.  This puts extra wear on the package, contributing to an early disintegration.  The rubber-based glue used to secure the plastic disc fasteners to the cardboard packaging is also of inferior grade; even the slightest temperature fluctuations cause the glue to lose its cohesive qualities.  The end result is that that the whole thing falls apart.  I'd expect a lot better from Fox, especially considering the fanbase for this franchise.
To make a long rant short, buy these reissues.  Even the ones for the chapters you might not have cared for previously; I promise you that they've all been done to the nines and are absolutely worth spending the time seeing again (sometimes as though for the first time).  But steer clear of the box set; Fox has given us a shoddy product in this guise and they must be held accountable by the fans of the series.",1077667200,7,1683,4.552980132450331

1956743,4,B0000VCZK2,"Firstly, I'm a big fan of ""ALIEN"". What Ridley Scott did was superb. What James Cameron did was incredible. What David Finch did was a dissapointment. What Jean Pierre did was average.
But when it comes to this Quadrilogy boxset, I believe its enough even the last 2 movies were bad, its good to own the entire collection.
What more you want for that kind of price with 9 DVDs, almost 50 hours of extras, contents you'll never expect to see. And most of all, the extras, deleted/extended scenes, alternate scenes and trailers, galleries and all the cool stuff and the evolution of all four Alien movies.
This is one boxset to own if you're a fan, and its one boxset I believe you will enjoy as many times as you want to.",1076284800,,720,4.421052631578948
1956744,5,B0000VCZK2,"I bought the ""Alien Legacy"" boxed set over a year ago which is basically this set with additional features. These movies have been tried to be emulated but without success over the years. No other ""alien"" movie has come close to the scariness of this one. This is the original movie set that will make you SCREAM, whether or not you are in space(i.e., in space no one can hear you scream).
The entire 4 movies are good. Each one different than the other. The first and second of course are the best. The third one took a few times to like since it was so different. The fourth one is more like a horror movie. The final creature alien is something out of a nightmare.  But it is still a very good movie with Winona Ryder.
Also, I'm starting to believe a fifth ""Alien"" movie is in the works since the fourth left you hanging as they were flying toward earth (is there an alien on the space ship that will invade the earth?). Whatever happens, this set is definately a must for the horror movie fanatic.",1076025600,,1001,4.324468085106383
1956745,5,B0000VCZK2,"The Alien Quadrilogy consists of 9 DVD's and contains TWO VERSIONS of each movie (Theatrical release and Special Edition which adds in all additional/deleted/extended scenes).  The extra DVD's of each movie consist of a lot of production and post-production features.  The ninth DVD givs you a variety of special features (I still need to take a look at those).  I haven't watched the rest yet, but the [Special Edition] of Alien3, made me able to give that movie a ""thumbs up!""...unlike before, where I had to give Alien3 a ""thumbs way down!"".  The extra scenes and extended takes give the movie more of a ""meaning"" in the whole dark plot in the Fury 161 High-Security Prison.  I will not say anymore.  I recently read another review where the person had to return it twice for bad DVD's and scratched discs.  If you ordered those off the internet and had them delivered to you, I would say that was a bad idea, to me anyways.  I never trust the delivery guys for they take bad care of the packages once the get them.

1956746,3,B0000VCZK2,"If there were ever a reason to buy all four of the movies ALIEN in one set, it would probably be to see just how you take a great premise and classic storyline and beat it to death with a shovel.  In 1979, Ridley Scott, working off of the wonderful script by Dan O'Banon and Ronald Schusett and the drawings of H.R. Gieger, set out to make a sci-fi film the likes of which had never been seen in film.  And it would never be repeated again.  It would only be (in this order), reinvented, rehashed, and recycled.
7 years later, Mastre Directore to be James Cameron came up to 20th C. Fox studios with an answer to the ""how to make a second Alien Movie"" problem, and the bid for director of the project.  Not only did he end up honoring the directing abilities of the great Ridley Scott, he ended up making a wonderful addition to the sci-fi genre and the Alien franchise.
The first two movies alone are enough of a reason to buy this set (if it were not for the fact that they were released independently of eachother...a smart move by the guys at 20cFox)
Then comes the two consecutive dissapointments in order of lousiness.
1992: Soon to be ""Fight Club"" Conductor David Fincher is brought on to helm the third installment of the ""soon to dwindle"" franchise.  With all of the other survivers we had grown to love from the second movie gone, we're left with the cookie cutter rehash of the Alien and Aliens Premise.  ""We're all going to die, and Ripley is the only one to save us.""  Fincher knew how to direct, it's just that everything else underneath that production seemed to fizzle.
And Finally: the Triumph de Lousy...Resurrection.  As films go, this movie makes Paul W.S. Anderson look like Frederico Felini (by no fault of Jean Pierre Jeunet, the wonderful director of Amelie and City of lost Children, which is much more his forte).  Ripley is cloned, has sex with the alien queen birthed from her, and is a conundrum of ""for/against"" human survival backwardsism that just end up confusing us.  The only reason to watch this film of the wrongly labeled ""Quadrilogy"" is to see how far wrong you can go in this now 35 year old franchise.
No movie collection is ever perfect.  In Godfather it was the part III, in Indiana Jones it was Temple of Doom, and in the new star wars films...yeah it was pretty much all of them.  But that doesn't mean we shouldn't dive in and examine what's been done.  Buy the movies...watch them, and make your own conclusions.  Just don't expect yourself to be able to sit through all of them more than once.

1956747,5,B0000VCZK2,"Yeah the first two movies are amazing. Everyone knows this.
The first appeals to the cinephile for its design and pacing. Ridley Scott's re-edit is one of the first that I have seen that actually shaves scenes that are about 2.4 seconds too long, making the sequences tighter and in my opinion better. You won't notice the cuts unless you've seen the original too many times.
The second appeals to everyone with a pulse. One of the greatest action movies ever made and one of the few to be able to boast an ""its not over yet"" sequence that truly dwarfs the rest of an already exhilating movie. Yeah, a few of the added scenes I feel were better left out due to poor execution but they certainly don't ruin the film.
The third film is problematic. Yet it still looks really good and the new edit I actually find to be a better one as well although at this point I have to wonder if its just because it is new. One of the gretest editions to this set is the documentary on the making of Alien 3. It's fascinating! 2 things about it I found especially striking. One was the amazing story Vincent Ward had originally pitched to the Fox Executives which was whittled down to the less expensive, less risky version which was filmed. The second was hearing the executive in charge of production admitting that they went into the film to make a specific date instead of going into the film to create a great movie. Well worth the price of admission.
The fourth movie is bad. Just plain bad. The new intro to the movie is amazingly awful which is somehow more appropriate for the tone of the film than the nice sense of unease the original credit sequence created. Seriously folks its a bad, bad movie.
Despite number four this is an amazing set. Buy it!",1075766400,,1745,4.422360248447205
1956748,5,B0000VCZK2,"I don't quite understand why the price of this box set is over 100 dollars .. you could go buy this at your neighbourhood Zellers, Wallmart, any store that sells DVD's for anywhere from $84.99 to $89.99 before tax. so amazon please explain why you have your units so overpriced?????",1075507200,5,282,4.66
1956749,5,B0000VCZK2,"Here I go again. Gushing. But I can't help it. This nine disc set is the definitive DVD release for rabid Alien fans like yours truly.
I first saw Alien when I was eleven years old, from a projection booth at a drive-in. The sound was on a little speaker, the noise of the two 40's-era projectors a constant drone. The reels were being changed MANUALLY. But none of that mattered: I was sucked into the film so deeply it was like a hallucination.
I got that feeling again watching the first disc of this release. The picture and sound definition are so much better than the prior DVD release that it's truly astounding. It makes me wonder just how loose the THX quality ""standard"" is, since the original DVD was also THX certified. Obviously, the best available elements were used in mastering every film in this edition, and then digitally scrubbed to a high gloss.
Everyone reading this knows that only two of the four films are truly great. Numbers 3 and 4 in the ""franchise"" (I always hated that word applied to films) are problematic. But to a real fan that hardly matters. The Alien mythology, as it has developed over a quarter-century, is somehow larger, more captivating than even the films themselves.  The first Alien, to put it bluntly, was a B-movie wrapped in first-class art direction, cinematography, and performances. Even two questionable sequels can't dim its hold on the imagination.
If you're even thinking about buying this, you know the films pretty well. There is no need to go into detail about them. What may tip the scales and make you open your wallet is not only the crisp, detailed transfers, but a staggering (I use that word deliberately) amount of extra material that is intelligently produced and well thought-out. The hours of documentaries are not your usual promotional material; they are real, no-holds-barred inside looks at the making of the films - warts and all. For example, there is no attempt to gloss over the fact that Alien 3 isn't very good, or that the production was mired in meddlesome Groupthink almost from the beginning. Nor did the suits at Fox (to their credit) try to hide any of the legal problems and personal conflicts that plagued the first film (producers Gordon Carrol and Walter Hill thought Dan O'Bannon's script was a stinker - they actually banned him from the screening room during dailies and he had to sue them to get his name on the credits).
It's good stuff, all of it. The features on the special-effects are tremendous, with interviews galore - even with original Alien designer H.R. Gieger (who is well-known to be reclusive).
The only quibble I have is with Fox's desire to squeeze ""special edition"" versions out of all four films when only two of them really warranted the attention - the famous (and definitive) Director's Cut of the second film - Aliens - and the fascinating (if not exactly better) first cut of Alien 3, which has some problematic production dialog tracks that never got looped.
The first and fourth films were director's cuts as released. Nonetheless, for a die-hard fan, the first Alien's alternate version is definitely worth a look, as it contains the famous ""cocoon"" scene, as well as some other bits and pieces we've heard about, but never seen integrated with the film.
Alien: Resurrection's special edition is not even minimally special, as Jean-Pierre Jeunet is such an efficient director that there just wasn't any material to add, aside from a few trims and a brief scene on Earth. It's not really a bad film; there are some amazing ideas in it. Isolated sequences (like Ripley being carried into the queen's lair) are inspired. But it's marred by some ill-advised ""humor"" and a hammy performance by Dan Hedaya as a ruthless military commander.
Overall, the Alien Quadrilogy (questionable title notwithstanding) is a required purchase for card-carrying Alien devotees, even if they own prior releases. Buy it. Get lost in it. The hours you'll spend in the visionary world of these films (flaws and all), plus the avalanche of supplemental material, will repay the investment many, many times over.",1075420800,2,4106,4.849002849002849

come on.........how many copies do we have to get before the studios get it right???
Ridiculous, right????
Well, they actually got it right this time ( after quite a few versions released already)...........
Oh well........
I hate to say it.....but this sucker is incredible...immense.....unbelievable.....over 5 ft. long....and heavy!!!! The packaging leaves alot to be desired....I saw a foreign release where they presented it as a book, with pages of DVDs....not the hard to handle, fold out 5 ft. package.
But enough about the package........the insides are a dream come true for any Alien fan....so much material, new versions never seen before, new commentaries, documentaries......I can't list all the goodies packed into this beast. Needless to say, this is highly recommended...
if you get only one special set this year, make it a doozie and get this one...you will not be disappointed....I have only gotten about one tenth of the way through this set, and everything has been above and beyond what any other set has had to offer. (the Lord of the Rings sets are close, and also must haves). No point in getting into the guts of this special set...........all I can do is to let you know that it is worth your hard earned money.....you gotta go get this set. Only sad thing is that David Fincher didn't get involved, but every other filmaker has added a tremendous amount of goodies, and each contributed a special version of their film just for this DVD set.

I give this my highest marks A+",1074211200,,322,4.161290322580645
1956754,5,B0000VCZK2,"Best:
1) The ""Alien"" movies are well-known for their high production values, great acting, realistic sets, outstanding creature effects and eerie atmospheres.
2) For all 4 films, there's an original theatrical version (the best for pacing) and an expanded DVD version (with deleted scenes restored). The original versions are still the best, but the expanded versions add more character information and answer questions that diehard fans have asked for years.
3) People who weren't huge fans of ""Alien 3"" or ""Alien Resurrection"" have a new incentive (through restored scenes) to give each another look.
4) In addition to newly-made commentary tracks for each film, there's enough special features to choke an elephant. With the many hours of extras, you get SO much behind-the-scenes information you might say ""enough already"".
Worst:
1) The plastic spindle plates that hold the discs in place come loose easily, so you may have to get out the glue.
2) I, like many, am still ticked that I already spent good money on the ""Alien Legacy"" set (that we THOUGHT was the definitive collection at one time) only to turn around and spend an equal amount to get this REAL definitive collection.
Recommendation:
This movie series is absolutely legendary and the special features for this collection are simply tremendous. It's a no-brainer - get this set NOW (whether ""Quadrilogy"" is really a word or not).",1074124800,5,1397,5.104803493449782
1956755,5,B0000VCZK2,This DVD set kicks ass. I think if you put the alien in the same ring with the predator - the alien would kick his sorry ass.,1074038400,,125,3.6666666666666665
1956756,5,B0000VCZK2,"I am a die hard Alien fan.  I have read just about all of the comics, have books, and own multiple copies/versions of each film.  This is the best set to date.  I would recommend it to just about any Alien fan (or sci-fi fan for that matter).  I have had this set for about a week now and I still haven't hit all the features.
My two favorite films in the series are Alien and Alien 3.  Now before you freak out and say ""Alien 3?  Is this guy nuts?!"", let me explain.  I am also a huge David Fincher fan.  I believe that his films are some of the most influential to date.  Now Alien 3 is not his best film, that is sure.  But, I have to commend him for what he did.  He took a corporate hacked, practically useless storyline and made it very watchable.  He didn't even have a script!  That alone amazes me.  He presented a very unique and interesting vision in the Alien series that really sets it apart from the rest.  He also brought back some of the suspense from the original Alien which was overshadowed by action in the second installment (which is also a great film by the way).  In any case, that is my second favorite.  My first is Alien of course.  Why not?  It is in fact THE original film and is a complete display of Giger's original design.
Nonetheless, this is a great set for the price and as far as I know the 9th disc is only available in it which is a definite plus.  My only concern is the lack of involvement of Fincher in Alien 3.  I know that he doesn't agree with the extended cut, but I want him to know that at least one person enjoyed the additional and alternate scenes.  I thought that they enhanced the story positively, while bringing the characters to life in a way we haven't been able to see before.",1073865600,3,1734,4.1441441441441444
1956757,5,B0000VCZK2,"I honestly can't remember the first time I watched Alien...its one of those movies that's just always been there as part of my film psyche.  To me, this is the biggest testament to its enduring appeal - a landmark for science fiction, horror, and the history of cinema in general.  It's difficult to overstate the significance of this film and its role in defining a genre - just think of the number of subsequent movies that pitch an ill-prepared and frightened rabble against a solitary unknown alien/ witch/ tooth-fairy beast...usually in the confines of a steam filled labyrinth.  Dry-ice sales alone owe a great debt to this film.
Clearly it wasn't just MY imagination that was sparked.  James Cameron also thought the idea was a peachy one; he followed up with the equally acclaimed `Aliens' (damn clever title too) and succeeded in rounding out a deliciously dark universe with plenty of great (Oscar-winning) special effects, memorable characters and rollercoaster action (""Punch it Bishop!!"").
The third movie, the adroitly named `Alien3' suffered famously from studio interference and this is reflected in the somewhat directionless pace and backtracking that mars an otherwise consistently striking performance from Sigourny Weaver as Ripley, a character by now ingrained in Sci-Fi gospel.  The, at times, ungainly special effects don't really help matters, but at heart this sequel of a sequel remains a flawed but highly enjoyable romp through an expanded and nightmarish universe.
So what was left to say?  Well, the Joss `Buffy' Whedon treatment of the Alien: Resurrection script seemed to have much to add...the underlying themes of genetic tampering and perverted sense of responsibility are powerful indeed, but somehow got lost in the gloopy splatty drooly effects overkill.  The bizarre choice of French director Jean Pierre Jeunet, of Amelie (and, City of Lost Children) fame did at least pay off in the lavish visual style of the film, with good production values and some choice scenic set pieces clawing the film back from the brink.
This collection then, sporting its smash hit vs. loveable miss lineup, is absolutely crammed with extra features, and it should be applauded that the Alien3 and Alien: Resurrection discs are as consistently interesting and well presented as the others.
Indeed, this goes a long way to explaining how both the fans and the moviemakers themselves regard this series - as one big happy family.
Like any family there are troublemaker and oddballs, but with a nostalgic heart it's easy to embrace them as a whole.  Featuring both original release and director's cut editions for all four films means that fans and film-buffs alike can compare and contrast each episode, and the shear weight of features should bring a giddy smile to any Alien aficionado.  All wrapped up in a stylishly embossed presentation case that positively sizzles with acid blood, this collection would make a worthy addition to the shelves of any Sci-Fi fan, but will be the pride and joy of any true Bug Stomper.",1073865600,,3040,5.112903225806452

The bonus features are unbelievable and jaw dropping. Aliens is the pretty entertaining but not quite as good as the first. The bonus features for Aliens, explain why the production team had such a hard time working with a very egomaniac, insultative and stubborn director like Jim Cameron. Alien3 is the weakest of the box...but it has some very cool as hell elements that should keep you glue to the screen ...for example some very beautiful cinematography and production design.

1956761,3,B0000VCZK2,"Quit while your ahead""  Boy that's one piece of advise the folks in Hollywood don't pay attention to and this Alien Boxed set (the second one by the way) is sure proof of that.  This nine disc set contains two versions of all four Alien movies.  The original theatrical versions and the special director cuts.  I am not a big fan of director cuts.  They usually contain footage that was edited out.  I figure if they weren't good enough to make the theatrical cut why do I want to watch them on DVD?  Yeah, I know the extended version of Lord of the Rings are good but they are the exception and not the rule.

Anyway the first movie Alien came out in 1979 and is still a great horror flick.  You all know they story.  A group of cosmic truck drivers are called to check out an S.O.S. beacon on a dead planet.  A guy named Kane played by John Hurt gets the infamous facehugger stuck to him and he is carried back to the star ship by his fellow astronauts.  After trying to unsuccessfully remove the facehugger the thing just disappears and over dinner the baby Alien burst out of Kane's chest leaving a bloody mess.  One by one all the crew members are killed by the Alien, except for Ripley, played by Sigourey Weaver.  She kills the alien which means she gets to be in all the other Alien movies.  Oh I forgot, Ash, played by Ian Holm, is not killed by the alien.  It turns out Ash is a robot who works for the company that wants to analyze the alien.  He's killed by Ripley and Parker (Yaphet Kotto).  Alien is great science fiction and great horror. It gets a ""9.0"" on the scale. The big selling point here is the added footage of the first movie.  There is really nothing new here as the added footage was in the deleted scene section of the original Alien DVD release.

In 1986 Aliens came out.  Ripley is found drifting in hyper space and brought back to earth where she is in trouble for blowing up the ship in the first movie.  They think she's full of crap about that whole Alien business.  She learns quickly that the planet in which the alien has been colonized and warns her company that soon people will die.  Well, before you know it people die and Ripley is know a person of expertise and is ask to accompany some marines to this planet for their simple task in killing the aliens.  Well, the task proves not to be so simple and a lot of marines die.  The action is all pretty good.  There is a lot of blood shed and gore which left me feeling very happy.  The supporting cast is pretty good, including Bill Paxton as a cowardly marine and Lance Hendrickson as the robot doctor.  Oh, the little girl was pretty good too.  The first alien a science fiction horror movie where this is more geared towards the action crowd.  The finale between Ripley and the queen alien is the highlight of the series.  Aliens gets an ""8.0"" on the scale.

Alien 3 is where things start to go downhill.  Even director David Fincher was not pleased with this sack of crap and refused to do a director's commentary.  The story this time is that Ripley is in her shuttle from Aliens and crashes on a planet that's pretty much a penal colony.  The other two passengers, including the little girl are dead.  Little does she know Ripley also brought along the alien which will now kill the prisoners until it's destroyed.  The drama this time around is that Ripley was impregnated by the alien while on the shuttle.  This movie focuses on gore a little to much.  I found the sensationalizing of Newt's autopsy a little unnerving.  Also, this may seem harsh but why would I care about a bunch of criminals who are being eaten by an alien.  Except for Charles Dutton the supporting cast is kind of annoying.  And finally, the end just sucks.  Alien 3 gets a ""5.0"" on the scale.

Now Alien Resurrection stars Brad Dourif.  Except for The Two Towers and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, any flick starring Brad Dourif has been pretty bad.  Same with that Dan Heyada guy.  Two bad character actors in one movie. Well, Alien Resurrection is not simply a bad movie, it's a stupid one as well.  This time Ripley has been cloned so they scientist can take the alien clone from her body and study it.  this leads to a bunch of aliens running around a space station and a lot of people dying.  Sigourney Weaver is terrible in this movie, as is the supporting cast, including and especially Winona Ryder as a robot. The only scene in this movie that is pretty cool is the underwater scene with the aliens.  If this movie had been more successful in terms of box office figures I am sure we would have had an Alien Five.  Thankfully it's theatrical run lasted  only four weeks so we are spared.  Alien Ressurection gets a ""2.0"" on the scale.  If you are a fan of the first two movies they can be purchased individually so you don't have to deal with the second two flicks.  This boxed set retails for about $100 so don't waist your hard earned cash on two classics and two bad flicks.",1073174400,7,4961,4.354803493449782
1956762,5,B0000VCZK2,"Oh yes, this sprawling 9 disc set covers just about anything and everything about the ALIEN series and a must for any serious fan of the movies. A theatrical and an alternate version (with extended and deleted scenes, especially with the second, third and fourth movies) of the four films are included. Commentary from the director, film crew and cast members are included on the alternate audio tracks. Each film have a separate disc chock full of background materials. A ninth disc contain even more supplementary materials for the first film, and trailers and promos for the other three.
ALIEN - The very first one remain my personal favorite. While it seems many fans prefer the sequel, one should be reminded there wouldn't be a sequel without the groundbreaking and often imitated but never surpassed original. The Director's Cut of ALIEN have some new scenes in it (Lambert plotting the course to the planetoid, Lambert slapping Ripey, the cocooned sequence), but there were other cuts in the film so in end it was a couple of minutes shorter than the original.
The cast and crew commentary and the background materials on ALIEN was everything a fan could hope for, almost everybody was involved: Ridley Scott, all the cast member (yes, even Sigourney Weaver) except Ian Holm and Yaphet Kotto, Jerry Goldsmith, and even the reclusive HR Giger (who seems to be morphing into the likeness of his work).
Material from the Laserdisc release of ALIEN was also included, which made for a fascinating read when it comes into the genesis of the script and the structure of the film, inlcuding pages from O'Bannon's original screenplay which featured 6 male crew members.
Many of the background featurettes include alternate shots and other footages of the film never seen before (the alien's tail about to stab Brett's back, Kane actually being hauled into the ship, Veronica Cartwright falling on her butt after being sprayed with ""blood"", actor Jon Finch as Kane before being replaced by John Hurt). There are even more alternate deleted and extended scenes not included in ALIEN's 25th anniversary DvD release.
The 25th anniverary release have two alternate audio tracks which featured Goldsmith's original entire score for the film, but it is not included here.
ALIENS - Although I like this film a lot, ultimately, the stereotypical gung-ho attitude and over the top performance of the actors who portrayed the ill fated space marines made ALIENS a bit uncomfortable to watch at times. In any case, there is no comparing ALIENS and its predecessor: both films are in completely different genres. ALIEN is a masterpiece in suspense and horror while ALIENS is a wild shoot 'em up action flick.
Once again, the deleted scenes added depth and scope to the film. However, the scene where Ripley discovered a cocooned Burke was not included in the film, or anywhere else in the extras, which was a disappointment.
ALIEN 3- I particularly dislike this film because it made everything that happened in ALIENS totally pointless. ALIEN3 is also a bit famous (or infamous) for the epic battles that David Fincher supposedly fought with the Powers That Be at FOX. The liner notes did some attempt at damage control; but the fact that Fincher did not participate in the release (the only director from the 4 films to do so), and other reviewers' opinions to the contrary of what the liner notes claimed, one can argued that ALIEN3 WAS an artistically compromise project. Of the four films, ALIEN3 has the most in terms of extended scenes. But extended or not, the deaths of Newt, Hicks, the android Bishop and Ripley made ALIEN3 a rather depressing film to watch....and you'd think in the future, there would be an Asian who can speak unaccented English!
ALIEN RESURRECTION: A slight improvement over ALIEN3, by the time this film came along, we have known too much about the Aliens already and are no longer afraid of them. So we end up with a particularly nauseating monster made from the genes of humans and Aliens (which met an equally nauseating end). The extended version has a totally different title sequence that was almost comedic, and alternate ending had Ripley #8 and Call on Earth (won't spoil you on where they landed).
Speaking of Call, Winona Ryder was totally miscasted as the dimunitive tough talking android.
In any case, this collection has basically almost everything you want to know about the Alien series. The bonus material on the first two films are worth the price themselves. The extended scenes on the last two films made them better and improves on them.
BTW, the original ALIEN's running time was close to 3 to 4 hours. I wonder if THAT would be released for its 40th anniversary.",1072915200,2,4703,4.902132998745295
1956763,5,B0000VCZK2,"No need to comment on the films at large here - the first two are classics, Alien 3 is flawed but by and large underrated, and Alien Resurrection sucks with or without ten extra minutes of footage.
But somehow Amazon made a mistake in listing each film's technical specs.  Alien's aspect ratio is 2.35:1, and the ""special"" edition included is an alternate edit, not an extended one, which runs 116 minutes (NOT 137 minutes).  It also lists Aliens as having an aspect ratio of 2.35:1, which is incorrect.  It's actually 1.85:1, the only such ratio of any film in the series.",1072828800,5,573,4.653465346534653
1956764,5,B0000VCZK2,"Man am I glad I didn't buy Alien Legacy cause this box set blows Legacy out of the water.  I love all of the Alien film the first 2 being my favorite.
Alien: 5/5 This movie started it all I love both the Theatrical cut and the Directors cut.  The DVD transfer is perfect and this movie is probably the most suspensful one in the series.
ALIENS:  5/5 This movie is probably my favorite in the series.  It has a lot of action and has a great storyline.  Believe you can watch this over and over and never be bored with it.  This DVD includes both the theatrical cut and the SPECIAL EDITION in I like the special edition a little bit better cause it helps develop the characters a lot better.  But the Theatrical Cut is just as good.
ALIEN 3:  4/5 Why does nobody like this film I like it both the theatrical cut and Extended cut.  Yes this movie is a little boring at times but that don't make it stink.  The DVD transfer is good for this film.  If I was you I would stick to the Theatrical cut that is my favorite version of the film even though the Extended cut explains a little more about Ripleys situation.
ALIEN RESURRECTION:  4/5 I like this movie a great deal, it has a lot of action in it.  The clone thing with Ripley is a little hard to believe but that is just minor cause yet once again Sigourney Weaver did a great job as Ripley.  I like both versions of the film.  The DVD transfer is good as well.
This a wonderful box set over 9 discs and 50 hours of Documentry footage in which is really interesting.  This set should last a good month or too.",1072656000,2,1559,4.129568106312292
1956765,5,B0000VCZK2,"...regardless of what you think of films three and four.
Okay. for the mathematically inclined:
We have nine discs. 2 for each movie , and one floater.
At 75$, this puts each disc at $8.33.
Now ignore that disc.
Now each  disc costs $9.375
Hate the fourth film? Ignore it and you have 6 discs and each film costs 25$
This assumes of couse, that the fourth film means NOTHING to you. At least you can see in the production featurettes just what in the heck they were thinking when they made it.
The great thing about this edition is its presentation of Alien 3. Belive it or not, David Fincher made a good film called Alien 3, but we never got to watch it until now. Please give this movie another chance, it really is a worthy addition to the series.
RESURRECTION, in my humble opinion, is another matter. I thought it was bad, but oh well.
This edition is a must for Alien fans, regardless of their feelings toward the latter films. The product is glossy and good looking, definitive and devoid of any bugs or glitches that I am aware of. The extensive pre-through-post production interviews are both informative and frank (the filmmakers acknowledge weaknesses and production tensions) and sometimes quite funny (the dog dressed up in the Alien suit was pathetic)
You already know you are going to buy this set, and I have nothing to say that would deter you",1072569600,2,1360,4.551020408163265

This glitch occurs in the original Alien theatrical version in chapter 18 at approximately 1:10 (not the director's cut).  Interestingly, the scene that skips in the original theatrical version has actually been cut from the director's cut (director's cut is 1 minute shorter).  Not really a big deal though... the extras and transfers more than make up for this problem which appears to be fairly widespread.",1072483200,3,511,5.059523809523809
1956767,4,B0000VCZK2,"Let's be honest, folks, how many of you out there who have bought this have actually viewed all these extras?  Ahhh... that's what I thought.  And how many of you will some day be able to say you've seen every extra?  Well, that's about 0.004% of you.

Extras are nice to have, but the real question is, how do the movies look and sound?  Great--the best they've ever looked and sounded.  Satisfied?  You should be.

That said, the movies vary dramatically in quality--the first movie being an undisputed masterpiece, the second being unabashedly fun, the third being flawed but at times superb, and the fourth being unspeakably inane and worthy of a long, drawn-out death.

Alright now, what happened to the isolated score for Alien?  I felt slightly ripped off when i bought this--perhaps the most enjoyable extra (with the also-missing Scott commentary a close second)--is mysteriously missing from the new set.  How depressing!  So sad that isolated scores are seldom offered on newly-made DVD sets.

Ahhh well.... buy this set for the fabulous look of the movies--particularly the first one.  If there's one movie that I can watch fifty nights in a row and not get bored for a second, it's Alien (scratch that - there's also Chinatown, Casablanca, Ran, and Vertigo).  Anyway, now we can all enjoy Alien in its full glory.",1072483200,,1326,4.857142857142857

ALIEN3, however, has slowly but surely become my favorite of all of them.  The 'special edition' featured in this boxset alone is worth the price of admission.  Forget ALIEN RESURRECTION; it should have ended with this movie.  If you're like me and consider ALIEN3 a magnificent standalone movie as well as great ALIEN movie, then you'll love this fully realized workprint version.  I have minor problems with it, ones I'd love to see fixed (re-release another DVD of just ALIEN3, Fox!):
1. Bring back the necessary actors to improve on the ADR that's kinda scratchy in some of the restored scenes.
2. Update the CGI; get WETA or somebody to redo the alien and Ripley's suicide plunge :)
3. Put back in the 30 minutes that was cut out of the 'Making of' featurette (for those of you who don't know, it was originally called ""Wreckage and Rape: The Making of Alien 3""... go to digitalbits.com for more info)
4. And don't forget.... DTS SURROUND SOUND!!!
Yeah, that'll probably never be done... but hey, who knows?  I'll keep my fingers crossed :)  Otherwise, I'll just watch all the discs in this boxset over and over (except RESURRECTION).  BUY IT TODAY!",1072310400,4,1311,4.765486725663717

1956770,4,B0000VCZK2,"This boxset is most beneficial if you want to see the process of making an Alien film and why each one turned out the way it did. We follow the journey of each film from its conception, to its production, its release, and finally the reaction it received, both critically and commercially. We see this through extensive interviews with many of the people involved in making these movies, and footage of all stages of production. Plus we are given a view of the films in hindsight through present-day interviews with many members of each film's cast and crew. We also get an insight into each film's particular drama, be it high or low, and how this affected the final product. Having the two versions of each film allows us to view the results of these dramas, and can be also be used as comparative pieces, especially when particular decisions were controversial. So we get the films we know and love/hate, plus a version of the film that tells us what should've/would've/could've been. The Special Edition of each film is either just a curiosity piece, a chance for the makers to fix minor problems, a satisfying completion, and/or an illustration/examination of a production plagued with problems.
It would mainly be of interest to the many Alien fans who know the movies inside-out, but it would also be of interest to those wanting to see the relationships between those involved in making a film- particularly a well-known franchise- from the writers, directors, to the studios, the producers, and the cast and crew...to each other and to the Alien story. We can see all the conflicts that occur in this process, as well as the creativity.
This boxset seems to include all the available material from all the Alien films, and has great nostalgic appearances by the actors playing the well-known characters, though sorely missed are appearances by some cast members (e.g. Yaphett Koto, Ian Holm and Winona Ryder in particular) and crew (director David Fincher). Also, it does not contain present-day audio commentaries by Sigourney Weaver, though she is interviewed. The previously-released ""The Alien Legacy"" was sufficient in terms of having the films in their final form and nothing else, but this is the definitive Alien boxset, at least until they possibly make the much talked-about Alien 5 sequel.",1072051200,2,2309,4.9689922480620154
1956771,5,B0000VCZK2,"I'm not gonna go into the whole rundown of the movies.  Others here have already done a fine, fine job.  I just need to vent about two things.
1)  I just got the darn 4-DVD box set about six months ago on ebay, and I thought I was in hog heaven then.  Extra scenes, some added footage, small documentaries.  I thought I had the definitive DVD set!  Imagine if next year, they come out with a 7-DVD set for THE GODFATHER after we've all bought the 5-DVD set, thinking we had the definitive version!  I just hope THIS IS IT!!!
2)  ALIENS 3 is just NOT a good movie...no matter how you slice it or reedit it.  It's got atmosphere to burn, and lots of great-looking sets and sweaty character parts.  But when the pedal hits the medal and all heck starts breaking loose with the alien...the action becomes incomprehensible.  Lots of shots of men running around and looking scare as they slam doors shut.  I still have no real clear concept of just WHAT all these guys did.  The climax just TOTALLY disappoints in every possible way.  David Fincher went on to direct some great movies, but this ain't one of them.
But, even with that big flaw, it's still great to have this set available.  Many more years of debate over which is the best (ALIENS) lie ahead, but although there is no definitive answer, this SHOULD BE the definitive set...I hope!",1071964800,4,1340,4.434426229508197
1956772,5,B0000VCZK2,"I am still working my way through this monumental set, but I went straight to the extended version of the mess that was Alien 3 to see if they could add some coherence to the film and fill some of the plot holes.  They did.  Did you ever wonder how Ripley could announce that she was carrying a queen and not just an ordinary Alien?  A deleted scene where they find the carcass of a ""super-face-hugger"" on the floor explains that.  A deleted sequence where they actually caught the Alien and a crazed inmate released it gives much more sense to the back half of the film.  The film was shot beautifully, but the butchers who cut it down to the magical two hour run are the ones who made it into the confusing mess that we all remember.  The added 41 minutes on the  extended version make all the difference in the world.",1071878400,2,820,4.285714285714286
1956773,5,B0000VCZK2,"The Alien series is without a doubt one of the best ever pieces of filmmaking created on film.  Not only does it have an amazing storyline, a strong female lead, some of the scariest creatures ever created, as well as some great action sequences and chills to boot, but it also has real depth and a strong sense of perseverance.  The first two films are still the true gems, with both Ridley Scott & James Cameron at the top of their game.  And the Extended and/or Director's Cut versions only make the films even better.  But Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection are still very good installments.  Although most of us are still angry with the direction that Alien 3 took, more and more are admitting how strong a film it actually is today.  And with the resurrection of Ripley in the fourth movie, who knows where the series will take us?  Earth?  The original home of the Aliens?  Only time will tell.
I just finished looking at everything on the Alien Quadrilogy.  Took a long time too.  Lots of archival reading to get through.  Very thorough.  Enjoyed the special editions to Alien 3 and Alien Resurrection a lot, though I preferred the original opening to Alien Resurrection and the original ending to Alien 3 from the theatrical versions.  The commentaries were pretty good.  Too bad Sigourney Weaver only participates in the original Alien and none of the other films (and even then, she doesn't say all that much) She does discuss ideas for Alien 5 with Ridley Scott towards the end (maybe she wants him to direct part 5?????).  My favorite had to be the ""Aliens"" commentary parts with Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Lance Henrickson, and Jenette Goldstein (Vasquez).  Bill saying that he's not getting paid to record this commentary but is at least getting free beer and reuniting with his Alien costars, was a highlight.  The commentaries for the theatrical versions are the same as the ones for the director's cut/special expanded editions, only some comments are omitted here and there, except in Alien 3 & Alien Resurrection.  Some additional comments are made at the end of the theatrical cuts of Alien 3 and the opening of Alien Resurrection, since significant changes were made to the films.  The segmented documentaries are also very detailed from the first film to the fourth.  Lots of great information!  The real empty feeling is the absence of David Fincher during the Alien 3 ""making of"" (except when you see him during the actual filming days) as well as from the commentary, since the director's from all the other installments participated.  Some disappointments were that not all the extras from the original Alien DVD Boxset were included in this new one, such as Ridley Scott's own personal audio commentary by himself along with another separate additional bonus audio track of different music cues by Jerry Goldsmith and some other cool things to listen to while watching the film (like the original audio track during filming where you can actually hear Ridley giving Sigourney direction as she moves about the ship towards the end.  The original featurettes from the first boxset are all missing too.  Plus the bonus 5th DVD from the original boxset that you had to mail away for to get in the states isn't featured here either, which is a bit surprising.  And for me, I was just surprised that the Aliens theatrical trailer was shown Pan & Scan, when a letterboxed version does exist (I have it on my Big Trouble In Little China 2 DVD Special Edition).  I'm just glad I didn't sell the original boxset as I originaly intended.  I like retaining all the extra material made available.

1956775,5,B0000VCZK2,"For those with lives, ""Alien Quadrilogy"" is too massive to be experienced in full -- it's a black hole from which no free time can escape. The behemoth stands at the intersection of video obsession and science-fiction geekdom, a space nearly as creepy as any visited in the films. Not scared off? Climb aboard -- here's one long strange trip worth taking.
DVD producer Charles de Lauzirika (""Tomorrow Never Dies"") has pulled together a quarter century's worth of ""Alien"" matter -- outtakes, production clips, art elements, promo materials, etc. -- somehow emerging with a coherent package. Some elements return from the series' fairly ambitious video past, but much of the content is new or unseen.
The set's backbone is what amounts to a 12-hour documentary, carved up into digestible segments of about three hours (and then again into featurettes, if the viewer chooses that navigation option). De Lauzirika weaves a tale populated by a Shakespearean cast of heroes, villains and martyrs, most of whom have their say in new interviews. Even the DVD docu itself is not without drama -- De Lauzirika pulled his name from the piece on ""the tragedy of Alien 3"" after the studio removed some of the more volatile material about the shoot.

In addition to great-looking versions of the four original theatricals, ""Quadrilogy"" streams in alternate versions of the films, basically director's cuts, three of them new to home video. The directors briefly introduce the rearranged movies, and join key cast and crew members in new commentaries. Only director David Fincher of ""Alien 3"" is missing in action, a shame because his film went through the most radical renovation.
The ""Alien Quadrilogy"" layout gives viewers a fighting chance, with a logical and uniform approach to content. Menus look good (and creepy), with little guesswork required. (Unfortunately, there's no main onscreen index.) Each title takes up two discs: one for the film(s) and another for bonus materials. A ninth DVD does clean-up with trailers and such. The films' release dates crack open a few Easter Eggs.",1071705600,,2077,5.108823529411764
1956776,2,B0000VCZK2,"The movies in this set are for the most part excellent. Alien, Aliens, and (yes) Alien^3 stand out as masterpieces of the science fiction genre. (It should be noted that the third film was much better received in Europe, where more mature audiences were no doubt able to handle the grim but inescapabley ending to what is essentially a saga of Lovecraftian cosmic horror.) Resurrection will always be a shameless commercial farce, but the special features for the other three films more than make up for this shortcoming. Unfortunately, the value of the films themselves is marred by the flimsiness of the packaging. The foldout is low-quality cardstock that creases and abrades with the slightest use, blemishing the printed surfaces. The plastic inserts are poorly fastened and come loose readily, causing the discs to jostle around inside the sleave and become scratched. Some discs also seem to be faulty, containing glitches that cause them to skip consistently at specific points, making them unwatchable without a remote control handy to fast-forward through damaged segments. Altogether, these problems detract considerably from the viewing experience and make the set as constituted more of a headache than a joy. I was forced to return my first copy for a working replacement and will likely be returning the replacement as well. The individual releases will hopefully be more sturdy and less bug-ridden, and I recommend that anyone considering this item wait instead for those to become available.",1071619200,3,1508,5.235537190082645

The interactive menus on all the discs are amazing, the most intricate and beautiful I have seen so far, and the hours and hours of extra features give wonderful insights into each of the films and those who made them. The picture quality is also something to behold. Very crisp and clear. Ok, so the rollout packaging is a tad awkward, but hey, it's really not that bad and for the low price of $69, I'm far from complaining too much.",1071619200,,576,4.293577981651376
1956778,5,B0000VCZK2,"As an Alien fan, the I would have been perfectly happy to pay the same amount of money for this set's bonus discs alone. Each movie is paired with its own dedicated bonus disc full of behind the scenes footage and new interviews, photo archives, concept artwork, 1st draft scripts... it's enough to make an old fanboy like me weep like a little girl.

Aside from the wealth of information presented here, there's something else that I appreciate just as much: the unflinching candor in the interviews. Usually when you watch behind the scenes talking head interviews with cast and crews, everything they say is through a sunshine filter, praising their comrades with every other breath, making it sound like the movie was made by a troop of saints and Good Samaritans. Not so here. If a writer had a problem with one of the producers, you'll hear about it, sneers and all. (Dan O'Bannon has always been a hero of mine, and now he's even more so. How can you not love this bitter old crank?) James Cameron has a reputation for being a big jerk on the set, and here you'll find out why. Alien 3 wasn't a successful installment of the series, and no one tries to skirt that issue here; they go into great detail to explain the process of how the project was born with a lot of potential and was then pounded down into mediocrity by a handful of studio execs with no imaginiation or vision. Vincent Ward, the original ""first choice"" director for Alien 3 has a lot to say, but David Fincher, the sore loser that he is, stubbornly and petulantly refused to appear here. I really would have loved to hear his side of the story, being a Fincher fan. I've lost a smidgen of respect for him now. I haven't even started on the Alien Ressurection bonus disk or the final all encompassing disk 9, and I haven't watched any of the movies in the set yet.

I still get an adrenaline thrill from Aliens despite the fact it has less action than most modern action thrillers. I didn't like Alien 3 and hated alien resurection.
  So why am I giving this 4 stars? Well I love filmaking as much as I love films and this is an excellent view of what went right and wrong vs what was intended.

First of all, yes, the packaging is a bit cumbersome, but big deal.

Secondly, after seeing the extended work print of Alien 3, that film has become my favorite of the tetralogy.  Upon its initial theatrical release, I was highly disappointed (except for the music) but I am now convinced that David Fincher was way ahead of his time and we are all now just catching up.  For my money, the Alien 3 discs make the set.

Thirdly, I'm still not all the way through this thing!  I've had it for a week and there's still a lot of content to look forward to.  Viewing this set has become something of a hobby.

Finally, any person remotely interested in filmmaking must buy this set as it offers a very good look at the trials and tribulations a great many people endure before we as an audience buy our tickets.",1071446400,,910,4.280701754385965

Really the only thing I didn't like was that in the Alien 3 Special Eddition, which I was very interested in watching because of how much they added to it, the sound for the special eddition parts couldn't be recoverd. Still overall the movie is great to watch even with that downfall. The only other bad thing about it was it wouldnt fit on my table cause the dvd box set opens to 5 feet! lol.

Given that Ridley Scott goes out of his way in print and on screen to say that he liked the theatrical release just fine but he added the deleted scenes and fixed some stuff at the request of the studio moguls so they could package these movies and take my money once again, the added scences add nothing and to this reviewer make the movie more disjointed and the ""remaster"" disappointing.  This is and was a great movie but...it doesn't hold up as well under scrutiny as it did in it's first run in '79(?).  Opening scene, the ship shakes on my 60"" screen. How did Dallas and Lambert get Kane back to the ship after getting face hugged? Why do they look for the chest buster alien for about 30 seconds before shooting Kane out into space wrapped up like a mummy and then go back and regroup and look for him some more?  What do Alien's eat to grow to full size in a few hours?  Why does it rain in the ship?  Why do they need bottles of coolant B4 they can get on the shuttle/lifeboat?  Do you really need coolant in space in an absolute vacuum?  Wouldn't the lifeboat already have whatever they needed on it?  Why do all 4 self destruct control rods go down when Rippley is trying to stop the self destruct and then we see at least one of them back up and her pushing the button inside of it?
The best Alien movie is not a movie at all.  It was the book by Alan Dean Foster.  None of the problems of the movie.  Both are still great.  I can't wait to watch ALIENS tonight.  Buy the Quadrilogy here or used, don't go to Borders and pay to much, also the packaging stinks.  It's like a slinky.

1956784,5,B0000VCZK2,"To help celebrate the big-screen re-release of Alien (a special director's cut), Fox home video has unleashed an unprecedented ""Quadrilogy"" set of all four Alien films, spanning the years 1979 - 1997). Just in time for the Holidays, too.

If you are from another planet and haven't seen Ridley Scott's Alien (1979) yet, here's the gist: the Nostromo crew lands on a far-flung planet in deep space to investigate a mysterious transmission emanating from its bowels. While on the alien planet, one of the crewmembers is attacked by a spider-like creature that adheres itself to his face. He is taken back to the Nostromo, where it is learned -- too late -- that the creepy critter has laid an egg into his body. Like all incubating eggs, it waits only to hatch... and it turns out to be anything but over-easy as it stalks the crew, picked them off one-by-one in the hollow, dark, shadowy and cyberpunky floating vacuum of the Nostromo. Where no one's screams are heard. That is, until the sequels were made.

The picture and sound is awesome, the bonus features are incredibly cool. I found the info on the original idea and alien design especially interesting. The only bad thing is the stupid case. Whoever decided to go with the fold out box is an idiot. If you fold it out it's about 4 feet long which is awkward to say the least.

1956787,2,B0000VCZK2,"I received the first copy of this on December 8th, and observed the packaging was poor, very flimsy and the plastic trays which were not fastened to the underlying cardboard well were already working their way loose or had popped off completely.  I loaded disk one and sat down prepared to be impressed by this latest incarnation of this collection of films and selected the DTS version of the 2003 version of Alien.  On the first chapter in the scene at the table during the heated argument about the change in course of the ship to intercept the Alien ship beacon, the DVD locked-up.  I did a fast forward and it locked up again later in the next chapter.  I had Amazon.com send me another copy, this time 4 plastic trays had already worked their way loose, and fell on the floor immediately after I removed the shrink wrap.  I loaded the first disk again and selected the DTS version of the 2003 version of Alien, same issue, same chapter same scene, this disk keeps locking up.
Mind you I have the industry acclaimed Denon 2900 player ($1,000.00 list) which has performed flawlessly on the hundreds of movies; not one issue ever.  Couple that with the fact that I have now gone through 2 copies with identical flaws has lead me to conclude that this set is not worth it.  There is clearly a technical issue at least with the first disk, coupled with the fact that the packaging is cheap junk.  Avoid this boxed set until each movie is released separately from what I have read that will be in 01/2004.",1071014400,7,1505,4.507352941176471
1956788,4,B0000VCZK2,"There's a LOT of stuff in this box set.  Almost too much, really.  You could spend a couple of weeks watching and reading all the extras, commentaries, script drafts, etc.  But by then you would have deconstructed the films so much that you have robbed them of whatever ""innocent viewing pleasure"" you enjoyed before you delved into the minutiae of the extra features.
So it is a double-edged sword:  Learn more than you ever thought you would about the 4 ""Alien"" films, but suffer having to watch them from then on and forever more through the filter of ""knowing too much behind-the-scenes info"" & ""curtain-pulled-back-on-the-Wizard"" insider perspective.

That said, it is a real treat to have this collection, even though the fourth film was abominably disappointing.  The packaging, which opens to a nearly five foot long foldout, is kind of neat but soon grows cumbersome and irritating.  When you unfold it the first time, it is like ""Hey, look what THIS thing does!"".  But after a while, when you just want to retrieve a single disc for some occasion, it has evolved to ""Okay, okay, I get it - it's long.  Just gimme the stupid disc already!""
For ""Alien"" fanatics, this is a must-have.  I don't own the ""Alien Legacy"" set, so I can't compare them.
I especially like the DTS sound on two of the films.  DTS always brings a new dimension to the listening experience that the still-great Dolby 5.1 doesn't.
Don't complain about the price, either.  You get your money's worth in spades, and you save on tax and get free shipping if you order it online (from the right vendor).  Besides, even if the price is a bit too steep for you, that amount of your money would have been lost to the sands of time soon enough anyway.

1956791,5,B0000VCZK2,"Well I finished all of my collection guys and am extremely pleased. Especially with the extended version of 3 which actually adds to the overall story and makes it much better. Four was better as presented at the theaters in my  opinon.
 In regards to packaging Although I really don't mind the unfolding to much afterall how many times are you going to view the films in a year but I do see a problem in the hubs. If even looked at the wrong way the discs come loose. To the serious collector this can be a problem with such a fabulous collection. But the set is done and leaves the obvious flaw for us to get clever with. So its not the product but the quality of the trays that hold the product that is the real bummer. Especially when moving or transporting them around. A more secure hub is needed such as the ones found in the regular keepsake cases. I do love my set though.
  In regards to the story, to my horror I finally realized that the reason it skewed to begin with was really Sigourneys fault as pointed out in one of the actress s' interviews, although I worship the ground she walks on:) It was really due to her conditions on coming back to the story that made the producers change the overall concept. She informed them that she would only do 3 if her character could die...she simply said she was just tired of the character. Its no wonder they needed to kill off the various characters in 3. So actually the actress was the one that really changed the whole story by her ""Do it or I won't come back"" conditions. Woe imagine the producers having to drastically alter the flow of the story to get their main draw to come back.
 If she would have lived in 3 then all of the other characters could have continued from 2. It would be safe to say that the script would have been completely different. The overall attitude of the fans would have also been greatly different. 4 would have not needed to be a resurrection but an ongoing story. I personally feel that the whole mistake was having to kill her off and that as I stated already was due to her own conditions on continuing the character. The bottom line is ......Sigourney made the boo boo not the producers writers or directors. But then again if they hadnt altered the story then their main draw would have not come back.  Hmmm",1070928000,3,2304,4.346511627906977
1956792,5,B0000VCZK2,"This consists of two discs for each film, the original and an alternate version (more on that below) on the first disk, and collections of approximately 2 hours of featurettes and other bonuses on the second disc.  The ninth disc is a hodgepodge of trailers and other items from previous DVD and laser disk versions.  Although the extras have been released in a variety of forms over several years (the John Hurt documentary 'The Alien Saga', being the latest), THIS is the definitive version.
'Alien' (average user rating: 4.6).  If you haven't seen this classic film, then you must be living under a rock.  The collection includes the original theatrical version (which I prefer) and the ""Director's Cut"", notable for its inclusion of the controversial captain-cacooned by alien scene (controversial because from the Alien mythology developed in later films, we know that only the massive queen can lay eggs).  I prefer the original (which is actually 1 minute longer), and interestingly enough, it appears that Ridley Scott prefers the original as well.  The making of featurettes are extensive and reveal Giger's extensive participation and how what was originally expected to receive a b-moive budget became one of the very few examples where Fox studios followed the vision with a classic.
'Aliens' (average user rating: 4.7).  This is the only sequel I know of that is rated higher than the original.  This time, the ""Special Edition"" version (also on the previous 'Alien Legacy' box set) is a superior experience and exactly is how upstart director James Cameron (who had written the script prior to the release of 'The Terminator') wanted to release the film, but was constrained entirely by time limits.  The result is additional scenes featuring the colonists and Ripley's family lost to the time she spent in hypersleep.  As with the first installment, the featurettes are interesting and thorough, although the Viet Nam War metaphor is not as thoroughly explored with Cameron as has been in other releases.
'Alien 3' (average user rating: 3.2).  As a fan of the franchise, this was perhaps the most anticipated part of this new box set.  The ""working print"" of the film (the longest of all the versions here, and complete with subtitles for missed sound editing), adds a depth to the film that was not in the original.  That is, the arrival of Ripley and the characters are covered much more thoroughly, the alien creature is begotten by an oxen with a much more original look, there is an additional plot twist arising from the nature of the inhabitants (criminally delusional), and there is no riduculously-timed chest-burster scene at the end.  Still, the film is a flawed masterpiece.  The film is better appreciated in light of the bad situation first-time director David Fincher had been placed in - not the least of which is an incomplete script during production and a set that had already been constructed for the ill-conceived ""wooden planet/monestary"" vision of the previously assigned director.  In this sense, the three production featurettes come across as almost an apology/tribute to Fincher.  (NOTE:  Fincher is the only director who is not interviewed on the box set.)
'Alien Resurrection' (average user rating: 3.0).  What happens when you put the French director of 'Amelie' (Jean-Pierre Jeaunet) in charge of an alien movie?  Well, foreign/art movies were all the craze in the last 1990s, so . . . Fox studios thought, ""Why not?""  In the end, many fans of the franchise did not appreciate the obviously satirical slant on this final installment.  The opening scene and ending scenes (the only additions of substance) on the extended version make the film even more tongue-in-cheek.  Despite the French director and crew's obvious regard for the original 'Alien' (as documented in the featurettes), armed with the return of Sigourney Weaver and the addition of superstar Winona Ryder, the director ultimately made a quirky, campy action film.  But in the end, it was the last quarter of the script that makes this the weakest of all the installments by far.  Postscript to Fox studios: if you had given Fincher this much creative freedom, you would have have a third masterpiece.",1070841600,317,4212,5.0520231213872835
1956793,5,B0000VCZK2,"Cannot add anything significant to the plethora of superlatives already used to describe the DVD box set, it IS truly incredible and a must own for any film geek.
However, I'd like to stress out the fact that I wasn't familiar with Alien Resurrection. Not being a masochist, I stayed away from this one after the DISASTROUS ""Alien small 3"", and by the truckload of negative reviews, having lost hope for this franchise.
HOWEVER, this set gave me the chance to experience it, and it is brilliant.
I think most of you were put off by the strong change in tone compared to the excellent first two.  In my opinion, there would be no use in adding a Cameronish of Scottish clone. Storywise, any new encounters between Ripley and the creature must be over-the-top because it is highly illogical. Maybe a flashback film on the creatures themselves and how they ended up crashing on that planet would be interesting, but without  Weaver's character.
So I really think you need to give the material a fresh directorial spin to make it worthwile.
Fincher's flawed film at least tried, but it just didn't tied together well, and I personnaly hated the pseudo-inmate-british despair-genX-nineties bull**** of it. Come on, it's a monster movie.
It is nicely shot, and I applaud Fincher for coming out of it alive. But the Alien 3 script ruins it all. I seem to be alone in the following opinion, but after seeing the section on disc 6, I hope that more of you will realize that Vincent Ward's agressively stupid original story of amish medieval hard-on monks living on a wood planet (on which this film is unfortunately loosely based) should have been without question shredded and flushed down the toilet.
In contrast, Jeunet's satirical mix of (sometimes hilarious) black humour and comicbook approach makes for an interesting addition to the series. It's almost Monty Python's Alien, which is a good thing. Watch for Dan Hedaya opening doors with his breath, or the great Brad Dourif teasing the creature through a window, or an insane alien babyboy with humane face(looking straight out from one of Peter Jackson's early gems) licking mommy in the face with its penile tongue. Inspired stuff. It even has a cool underwater chase sequence.
Weaver is, as always, great. Winona Ryder is cute as a goodwilled robot in a pirate crew.  Cinematography is awesome and set design is top-notch.
So what is there to complain? It's not Ridley Scott's Alien? Of course not. It didn't even try to be that.
I admit that the cloning premise is far-fetched, as if a DNA sample from my blood would include information about the spaghetti I ate or the socks I'm wearing. But it's in good fun. And what else would you do to resurrect the main participants?  Fincher should not have killed them in the first place.",1070755200,6,2784,4.781704781704781
1956794,5,B0000VCZK2,"This set is a monster of a set.  I don't know of any other way to put it.  For any fan of the series, this set is a MUST own.  Others before me have already gone into detail of the plots of each film, so I'll focus my views on the extras.  It has taken me almost one week to go through everything this set has to offer (5+ hours of viewing a day).  The second disc of each film is a great treat as it exposes each film's creative process from pre-production all the way to post-production and offers a lot of insight from just about everyone (I paticularly enjoyed Cameron's apparant fustrastion about the production crew taking a break everytime the tea cart rolled in).  The commentaries are also top notch.  Even if your not a fan of listening to commentary tracks, listen to the Aliens commentary, which combines Cameron (Director), Gale Ann Herd (Producer), Alec Gillis (Creature Effects Designer), Carrie/Christopher Hein (Newt/Timmy), Micheal Beihn (Hicks), Bill Paxton (Hudson), Lance Hendrickson (Bishop), and the actress who played Vasquez (can't recall her name at the moment).  It is a dynamic and entertaining track and is just awesome.

1956795,4,B0000VCZK2,"i've just finished watching the new versions of the first, third and fourth films (i've seen the special edition of the second before), and i'd like to let potential buyers know what to expect.  the new version of the first film is by far the best of them all.  the third, however, uses footage where the sound could not be recovered completely intact, so subtitles kick in when the dialogue becomes difficult to understand (you can turn the subtitles off, though).  the third probably contains the most new footage of the four films--probably more than the other three put together.  the new version of the fourth film has a perplexing sequence where the guy in the motorized wheelchair thing gets a knife stuck in his thigh, removes it, and throws it back at ron perlman's character.  call (winona r.) then removes the knife from wheelchair's thigh (again?) and breaks off the blade??!!  huh?  anyway, at the very least you get the director's cut of alien, the special edition of aliens, and the theatrical releases of all four (in case the problems with the new versions of the last two bother you a lot).  plus over 2 whole days worth of bonus material, which i haven't yet had the time to peruse.  all in all, an excellent set and an inexpensive one at that.",1070755200,4,1263,4.62780269058296
1956796,5,B0000VCZK2,"As an owner of the previous 'Alien Legacy' collection I was a bit skeptical of this collection. No secret studios have turned DVD re-releases into a virtual cottage industry. In a lot of re-releases (X-Men 1.5) for instances its nothing  but a crude attempt to make money off fans. But this one - like the Lord of the Rings Extended Edition - is worth the price.
The Director's Cut of Alien and Aliens are a bit excessive. I think both are examples in directors fiddling with fairly perfect versions of their work. The most fascinating is the work print cut of Alien3 which gives hint to a much, much better film that could have been made (and I am one of the few that defends Alien3 as a flawed bit of genuis).
Alien: Resurrection is of course worthless. I've never watched it once when it came with my Legacy collection, and I doubt it will get much attention from me this time around.
The extras are really great if you are one of the very few people that utilizes the extras features. The sound mixes are immaculate (much better than the least release) and the transfers look great. The Alien Legacy set didn't look bad except for the transfer of Aliens which had a ton of artifacts and other bugs with it. Those are gone in Quadrilogy. Much improved.
My only real compliant is that Fox pushes Alien: Resurrection into an otherwise perfect set of films much the way the Godfather movies include Godfather, Part 3 because it is doubtful anyone would buy it.
A last thought: I hope George Lucas follows the lead of the Alien Quadrilogy, and includes both the original cuts and Special Edition of his Star Wars trilogy next year.",1070755200,2,1630,4.54421768707483
1956797,4,B0000VCZK2,"By now everyone knows who Ellen Ripley is - Sigourney Weaver.  Actually she's the heroine of this 4 film - 8 disc phenomenon called ""Alien Quadrilogy"".  This box set includes all four films in the series in revamped, modified, remastered and re-edited editions. Why? - primarily because number three and four in the series could really use the help - I'm assuming, but hey, it's a pretty good guess.
PLOT of all four films: A survivor of an alien attack - Ellen Ripley, goes back for more and more punishment against a really nasty looking aggressor from outer space that by the last installment looks more like a finger puppet reject from Jim Henson's muppet lab.  Okay, enough criticism on the special effects.  Seriously, though; my advice to anyone who wants the original masterpiece from Ridley Scott and James Cameron's brilliant sequel; wait till January when the films will be made available separately.
TRANSFERS: Near pristine.  ""Alien"" - the first film, is the real stand out.  Color balancing is superb. Flesh tones are richly textured. Blacks are black. The haze and related age artifacts are practically non-existant. Film grain has been greatly reduced over the previous issued DVD. The audio has been masterfully updated. ""Aliens"" - same transfer as before; Cameron didn't really see the need to update it.  Near pristine. All of the above criteria apply. ""Alien 3"" Pristine transfer - sorry excuse for a sequel - even in this re-edited form. ""Alien Ressurection"" - I'm going to sleep, just thinking about it. All of the above criteria apply to these transfers as well.
EXTRAS: I'm not even going to bother. Suffice it to say, that if you invest in this box set you will possess the largest compendium of useless information available to mankind on a digital format.  While the documentaries are a fantastic bonus, much of the material featured there is repeated in other ""extras"".  There's also a lot of junket material that really doesn't enhance your movie going experience so much as it indoctrinates you into believing part ""4"" is the greatest horror/sci-fi of all time.

I will also admit to the utter dissapointment I felt when I first saw Alien Resurrection in theaters (but have warmed to it over the last six years - mainly for its visual presentation being the best of the series and having Ron Perlman in it), but this is an amazing DVD set.
In the mold of the Lord of the Rings Extended Editions this set gives you everything Alien you could ever want.  All the movies are digitally restored and presented beautifully (highlighting the look of Alien Resurrection against the other three when viewed back to back to back to back).  There are two versions of every film (commentaries on each version by cast and crew - noted absences are Fincher, Weaver, and Khondji) and even though the original theatrical releases are ultimately the better, more balanced and paced cuts in every case it is interesting to see some of the deleted scenes worked back into the films.  And the supplemental materials go on forever.
Alien is a masterpiece.  Aliens is a close second (close).  Alien 3 is an intriguing work almost apart from the series.  And Alien Resurrection is not without merit.  That said this collection makes even the more difficult moments of the third and fourth films worth watching again and gives us a greater appreciation for Ridley Scott's vision and James Cameron's extrapolation of that original vision.

I remember my dad and I watching ""Alien"" when I was 10 years old or so in a hotel Spectravision, and I remember being terrified by ""the perfect organism"", (as Ash put it), and the conspiracy and duplicity of ""The Company"".
Then in 1986, I remember seeing Sigourney Weaver and the Queen on the cover of Time with the caption ""Horrors!"" - and my dad and I just HAD to see it! Everything about it was great - Cameron executed this perfectly. One of the best examples of this is when Ripley, after rescuing Newt, stumbles into the Queen's chamber. The dramatic score suddenly stops, the camera pans around, and I'll bet there wasn't a single audience member who didn't gasp upon seeing the multitude of eggs and the egg-laying itself. I still shudder when I see it.
For a long time I thought Alien 3 and Resurrection where just pieces of junk, more Hollywood attempts to squeeze money out of a good franchise (and in the process, squeezing the life out of it as well). To me, those movies never existed - I thought they shamed Ridley Scott, Cameron, Weaver, and the xenomorph.
When I bought this, I gave the special edition of Alien 3 a whirl, and I found I liked it a lot better than the original. Yeah, so some of the Alien CGI isn't great - so what. By now we've seen the creature enough we know what it looks like. I came to enjoy the starkness of the movie, and the feeling of finality and despair for the inmates and Ripley. (Not to mention I like the way the Alien was born in this one...I don't like movies with canine casualties.)
Resurrection was pretty much the same. I never really liked it, and it was useful only in explaining more of the creatures life-cycle, which I always found interesting.
The extras are great - I usually skip them, but the ""Aliens"" disc, with all the interviews, commentaries, etc. was FANTASTIC for a fan like me.
Since the original ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" are out of print, I think this is the only way to get them on DVD now. But those two films are worth the price of admission.",1070582400,2,2138,4.456632653061225
1956806,3,B0000VCZK2,"The picture-quality is beautiful on all disks. The extras are great. The sound is superb. There really isn't more you could want. The problem is overkill. At what point is too much simply ""too much""?
I mainly bought the set for the 2003 Director's Cut of the original ""Alien"" from 1979. This is the director's cut of the film that was screened in theaters in the Fall of 2003. Primarily, I was interested in the restored image from the original negative and as I compared this with a previous DVD release, there is recognizable improvements in picture-quality (less grain, better highlights, sharper image, blacker blacks, etc). The original Ridley Scott ""Alien"" is one of my all-time favorite movies - and it has never looked or sounded better! Watch the brilliant bright reds of the splattering blood from the now legendary kitchen scene and you'll see ""Alien"" like you haven't before.
I am not as much of a fan of the sequels, as they work primarily as science-fiction films exclusively, nor do any of them stand-up on their own. For better or worse, sequels were eminant in any case; but let it be said that none of them live up to even half of the brilliance of the original 1979 Ridley Scott masterpiece, some being completely silly and others being just average.
The decision to originally make a B-rated monster movie into an ""A"" movie of the highest quality was a major innovation and brought back a level of film as a thrilling good time. (We must remember that the original Universal Studios monsters films from the 30s and 40s were not ""B"" films in their day, but big-budget blockbusters).
I do think that 9 disks is a little ridiculous, nor will I likely ever bother to even view half of the footage included in this box set. It's entirely overkill to the point of decreasing impact rather than strengthening it. I would safely guestimate that over 50% of the material presented in this box set is unecessary and you wouldn't likely ever watch it.
The packaging, (I completely agree with one reviewer here), is too creative and structurally isn't sound. Why not just give us 4 clamshell boxes inside a strong outer box? The roll-out of 9 disks is absurd and cumbersome, and because of the weight the glue starts to give and your CD caddy will soon come apart. It's a valuable lesson in how NOT to package DVDs! Please don't get too creative with packaging.
Personally, I wouldn't spend the money UNLESS you absolutely adore the ENTIRE ""Alien"" series, (or are Sigourney Weaver's mother). Otherwise, you'll be left with WAY too much info and extras and stuff. Otherwise, just buy the films indivdually. Case in point: these remastered director's special editions will be available in early 2004 individually.
In my opinion, only the first 1979 original ""Alien"" is a great film. The sequels are Saturday afternoon rainy-day fare, and don't make the exhorbitant fee worth it in the end.",1070582400,5,2895,4.780439121756487
1956807,4,B0000VCZK2,"Film direction is like gambling; no matter how well you've done you always think you can do better. That's the premise behind this re-release of the four Alien films. So did putting it all on the line pay off? Sometimes. Ridley Scott's original film was a masterpiece of suspense and terror. The snail's pace pacing, like Hitchcock's best films, created an underlying tension that found release in a few key scenes. Unlike Blade Runner, Scott's vision of Alien hasn't changed significantly. The extended branching scenes do add a number of fine character moments but they don't make the film any scarier or more effective. In the boxing match between Alien vs. Alien Revised Directors Cut, it's nearly a draw where both films have their merits. Ultimately, though, the leaner, meaner original cut wins simply on the sheer power of the film. It's hard to improve on perfection.
Cameron's Aliens is an altogether different matter. Cameron was contractually obligated to provide a film to Fox that didn't go over a certain time limit. As a result, Cameron had to work with a number of restrictions and knew, despite the power of many sequences, that he was going to have to slice and dice the film. The original theatrical version was pretty powerful (and has been only available on video and laserdisc--this is its DVD premiere) but the extended version (which saw life on DVD and laserdisc previously)wins the match. Cameron's ability to craft strong characters and create complex, intelligent storylines only enriches this film. The extended version has visuals that were completed long after the film wrapped but the quality is comparable to the original visual effects. These sequences seamlessly fit in with the older visual effects. I still like the idea of having both because they are each unique. The theatrical version is a punchier and more direct experience. The extended version is like watching a flower unfold; you appreciate each individual petal and its unique form. OK, that was a lousy simile.
Fancher's Alien 3 was crippled from the start. Vincent Ward's original premise was fascinating and the rewritten screenplay kept some of the basic elements but dispensed with some of the best plot points and themes. Still, the workprint offers a fascinating glimpse into what might have been if Fancher had been allowed to release a longer version of the film. I have to agree that the newly added CGI effects don't measure up to the original (unlike the care that went into Cameron's revised version)but the added sequences do improve the film and make it much more distinctive and less derivative.
I have to disagree with the assessment of most critics regarding Alien Resurrection. It's an underrated gem that manages to be both satrical and full of over-the-top dramatic moments. It lacked the power of the original, the character development of Cameron's second film (and action)but played with the conventions and expectations of the audience. Joss Whelan's original screenplay is witty and fun. It's a script (and a film)that's self reflective and about film. The final theatrical version is the superior version although it's interesting to get a glimpse at the ""alternate"" version as well.
The extras include a number of featurettes (the original Alien only come with 9 vs. 11 for most of the others). There's also the original laserdisc extras archieved on the final disc. You also get a glimpse into screen tests and other cool rarities.
The big question would be--is this worth the gamble and the additional money? It all depends on how much you appreciate the first two films. The previous DVD version of Alien had a wonderful commentary by Ridley Scott but it didn't have anything near the extensive extras this version has (including Dan O'Bannon's original Star Beast treatment which, in my mind, resembles It! The Terror Beyond Space even more than the finished product does but with signiciant departures as well).
Cameron's second film also was available on a terrific DVD previously. It had lots of extras but, again, the extras are more indepth here. Still, without a Cameron audio track, this DVD reissue is missing something. On the other hand, for those who were fans of the original theatrical version of the film, having both versions is a big plus.
The third film is a toss up; Fancher's film wasn't well liked by most fans or critics. It had its merits but was compromised from the beginning by the revised screenplay. Still, there are marvelous performances given by Charles Dutton and Weaver among many others. The work print version gives a glimpse into what might have been and makes for interesting viewing even if you dislike the third film.
The fourth film showed the franchise on its last legs; the satire and tongue-in-cheek approach to the material revitalized much of the film. On the other hand, the much of the plot and the character of Ripley had been played out by the time of the fourth film. It's still a noble effort that doesn't quite capture the raw power of the original or vitality of the second film but does improve on the third film. If you need to have the extras and the digitally improved picture quality for the first two films (I didn't see a huge difference but Alien did look a bit sharper and cleaner) and all the extras, this is well worth picking up.
First I have to admit I haven't had the time to investigate all the extras or investigate every crevice of this new version.
If you're a fan of the third and fourth film as well, this would be a good boxed set to pick up.",1070496000,7,5546,4.869841269841269

1956810,5,B0000VCZK2,"The Alien Quadrilogy set, is, by and large, the best, most feature-laden set you've ever seen. To keep it brief, if you are a casual fan of the Alien films, you are probably perfectly safe keeping your original Alien Legacy set. The overall quality of the picture and sound on the original set was basically the same as the Quadrilogy versions, with the exception of some added commentaries, new footage on films 1,3 and 4, and 2 new DTS soundtracks (Alien and Alien Res). The real reason to justify spending the simolians IMO is the incredible amount of documentary content. The length and quality of the documentaries is beyond belief. Far exceeding the length of the films they are about, the making of features exceed even the extended Lord Of The Rings sets for thoroughness. I realise I am probably not representative of most people here, but I personally love documentaries, good ones anyway, and I often watch certain DVD documentaries more often than I watch the movies themselves, so for me, it was more than worth the investment. If you are a commentary and documentary fan, this set is worth every penny. Only 2 complaints here, 1 small and on pretty darn big:
The minor niggle I have with this set is the stupid packaging. The set looks terriffic, with great art and the spindles hold the discs firmly. The problem is the box unfolds accordian style to over 5 feet in length. If you just want to see disc 9, it's a real operation and a pain in the neck. Whoever designed this thing never thought of mobile dvd watchers that's for sure. The 1 severe drawback, and to me inexcusable, is the transfer quality of the Aliens disc. While Alien 1,3 and 4 all have beautiful, razor-sharp video transfers, Aliens looks only slightly better than a VHS cassette. I watched the first 2 movies right in a row upon getting the set, and I couldn't believe how much worse Aliens looked than the first film...and it is 7 years newer!? Let's face it. The vast majority of fans are really only interested in the first two movies and it's really hard to believe that they couldn't find a better telecine master for arguably the most popular movie in the set. With that aside, this is an awsome set assured to keep you busy with the features for days, if not weeks, and should be the last time you will ever need to buy the Alien films...until the super-duper actually remastered version of Aliens comes out.

All four titles in the series are presented in both theatrical and or extended versions.  Besides commentaries, there's a huge treasure trove preproduction, production and postproduction extras.
Although the sequels don't have the freshness Ridley Scott's 1979 ALIEN that began the series, Weaver delivers increasingly nuanced and intense performances as the storyline evolves.

Too bad, then, that there are glaring omissions in this otherwise superb offering. Why is it, for instance, that there are apparently no interviews, commentary or featurettes with Sigourney Weaver?? Without her, the series would be infinitely less accessible and interesting. Her role in ""Alien"" was a groundbreaking, gender-bending eye-opener, and her Oscar-nominated performance in ""Aliens"" was equally revolutionary.
Second, why was ""The Alien Legacy"" substituted for ""The Alien Saga""? The latter, narrated by John Hurt of ""Alien,"" was a spectacular and riveting analysis of the making of each film in the series and their relevance. It provides a wonderful, insightful bookend for the series, and includes interviews with the principals, including Weaver!
Lastly, while some featurette material focuses on H.R. Giger, I wonder if it's too little? This master's imprint on the series - and subsequent sci-fi/fantasy films in general - is indelible and unmistakable. His creepy-yet-beautiful artistry not only created arguably the most memorable creature in film history, but supplied the wondrous alien environments as well. Directors come and go, but his influence was omnipresent throughout the series and should not be overlooked.

My personal favorite is Aliens because that's the one I saw as a little kid and remember the best.  Oh well, Happy Unfolding.",1068768000,2,685,4.175572519083969

How can a review be written on something not yet released?
I own the Legacy box set on DVD so this is not the first time Aliens is on DVD as one reviewer wrote. I normally don't even bother with the reviews posted here but these got me going.
What the previous reviewer you were referring to was trying to say is that the original ""Aliens"" (the non-extended version) will be released for the first time on DVD.  This DVD box set is the box set of all BOX SETS!  Hands down.  You've got both the original theatrical version and the extended director versions of all four films, huge commentaries of all four films, hours and hours of extras and quite simply the best digital transfer technology this side of the digital universe.  You can't go wrong with this set at a price that isn't breakin the bank either.  I used to think that my ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" box set was the bomb.  That shadows in comparison to what this gem will be.  It's what fans have been waiting for and all the really cool scenes from Alien 3 will be here for everyone to view-FINALLY!!  Don't miss out December 2003!",1068681600,3,1126,4.3798076923076925
1956832,1,B0000VCZK2,"Ready for the movie?  Ready for the Ultimate Edition?  Ready for the Special Ultra Limited Collector (with numbering) 10-disc edition?
What am I driving at?  I would love a show of hands of who is sick and tired of a series of movies being released, only to in turn have special releases with deleted scenes, and in turn ultimate releases with deleted scenes, making of documentaries, etc.
So, after having purchased Legacy when it first came out, we are now presented with the Quadrilogy -- after getting past the initial guffaws of the title, I'm annoyed that YET ANOTHER SPECIAL EDITION HAS BEEN SLIPPED PAST ME.
Case in point -- Lord of the Rings.  I was disgusted to learn that after having purchased Fellowship that they were going to release ANOTHER edition that had added footage, etc.  The same has been done with Terminator 2, Stargate, and Army of Darkness.  Although it has not been done yet, I would not be surprised if Lucas follows suit
If you're going to release something, do it right the first time and stop wasting our money.
Five stars for LEGACY.  1 star for the blatant commercialism that Quadrilogy intends to reap.",1068681600,7,1138,4.717171717171717

Getting the never-before-seen director's cut of all four alien movies is worth the $70 alone..  but toss in a jaw-dropping 40 hours of special features, and you have the greatest DVD collection ever released.",1068422400,42,311,4.849056603773585

8003731,5,B0000VCZK2,"If you're looking to buy any of the films, this is the one to buy hands down. It includes 2 versions of each film, the theatrical release and the director's cut, and the 5th disc is loaded with special features. Not to mention the fact that it's inexpensive for what you get. Each disc is locked into it's own page within the heavy stock like book that slides into a protective slipcover. It's a beautifully presented package. A friend of mine bought it here and had it sent to me as a gift and it's the prized jewel in my movie collection. I watch them often. (Thank you Speederpotpie)

Because of the box and the fact that Prometheus and Alien Covenant are missing and there's a new boxset out with those movies I can't say I'd really recommend this. Unless you hate Prometheus and Alien Covenant, but if you do you probably don't like 3 and Resurrection either.",1523059200,,433,4.564102564102564
