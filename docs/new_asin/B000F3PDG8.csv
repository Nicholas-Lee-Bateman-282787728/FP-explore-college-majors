8588388,4,B000F3PDG8,"I bought this for my new 5 month year old god daughter to enjoy because her name is lucy but we call her lulu! I remember watching lil lulu as a young girl at my grandma and grandpa's house and always enjoyed the music and mischief lil lulu was getting into while learning a lesson in every episode ! On this dvd I have been introduced to lil audry.  She is also a lil trouble maker (but all in good fun) I have enjoyed this dvd and am excited to explore this wonderful classic cartoon world with my lil lucy.  Quality is fair, these are very old cartoons so I think it's good quality for what it is (older quality reminds me of the good old days) I wish it was longer but I am happy I bought it !  Arrived fairly quick, but dvd case was flimsy and dvd loose inside case!",1345593600,,771,4.026143790849673
