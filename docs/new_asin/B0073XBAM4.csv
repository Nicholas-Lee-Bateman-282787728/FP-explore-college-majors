8509518,5,B0073XBAM4,"I have the whole set.  When i was a pre-schooler - i remember watching this strictly for the laughs (especially Ringo's antics)

Now - i bought them for all the great songs they perform.

These dvds had to be sent to Canada - I was completely surprised when they arrived so quickly.",1408579200,,282,4.384615384615385

8509520,5,B0073XBAM4,"Yes there here for more cartoon fun, the fab four George,John,Paul and Ringo for their vol. 3. Look what you get, you get Paul face and George face on disc #1 and 2. The Beatles Cartoon Adventures Series 1965-1967 with 39 legendary episodes and 78 sing-a-longs songs from the creator Al Brodax's, who was called upon to make another Beatles Feature titled "" The Yellow Submarine "". Now let's see we have a rare song by the fab four that is only found in their Rarities cd, the song is "" Komm Gib Mir Deine Hand ""/ I want to hold your hand. In German it was a nice touch to hear this tune, not to mention with the Beatles in cartoon form! Maybe we may hear the other song in German "" Sie Liebt Dich ""/ She Love You. In the remaining and final volume? , will have to wait and see. During the sing a long portion of the show we still see Ringo again who  is still filling in for the vacationing Prop-Man! I guess the prop-man will never come back to the show, as Ringo would deliver with a funny line punctuate by his charming laugh-, "" Heh-Huh-Yeah "". Now we have a song which I haven't heard before that song has the word "" believe it or not "" POOP and is included in the song ""Bad Boy ""and  I never listen to that song before because I never had the Beatles lp called Beatles VI. Any way my wife and I were laughing so hard that we made a oh no i'm just kidding. Now for  the end of this review until next time as John,George,and Paul unplug their guitars, and Ringo,with a forlorn expression on his face watches his drums deflate as he unplugs them! Later The Drummer",1330300800,2,1568,4.134426229508197
