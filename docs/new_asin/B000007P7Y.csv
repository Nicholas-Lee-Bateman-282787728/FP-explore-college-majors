1196662,1,B000007P7Y,"I bought this because it looked like a good deal but I had no way of knowing that it was dubbed. I had originally seen both films in Italian with subtitles...and both truly are wonderful films (Sophia won Best  Actress for Two Women). If they only included the information (dubbed or  subtitled) I would have been able to make an informed decision instead of  taking a shot in the dark. Obviously, I'm not happy with the dubbed  version. Oh, and also, the quality of the video is less than great.",916358400,63,496,4.477777777777778

Also, the movie's theme was so brilliantly conveyed via the subtitles - they did a great job with that in 1962!

1196770,4,B000007P7Y,"One of the most delicious comedies ever made! Sophia and Marcello are without peer as romantic partners. So Italian: one story concerns a devoted mother (viva la famiglia); another is about a devoted son, a seminarian and a call girl with a heart of gold (guess which character Marcello did not play). I never figured out the middle story in which a single man and a bored diplomat's wife go for a drive, have a minor accident and go their separate ways.

1196845,4,B000007P7Y,"NB - As is their wont, Amazon have unhelpfully bundled the reviews for the various different releases and formats of this film together. This review refers to Kino Lorber's US Blu-ray release.

Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow grabbed the Best Foreign Film Oscar and was a big hit with international audiences, and while it's far from high art, it's not difficult to understand why. It's a glossy crowd-pleasing trio of sex comedies starring Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni that, by the sheer virtue of being foreign, gets away with far more than Hollywood pictures of the day could. Not that it's that risqu&eacute; by modern standards, but it makes no bones about what its stars are really after. In the first, Adelina, Loren is one of the legion of women selling contraband cigarettes on the streets of Naples who finds that she can stay out of jail as long as she is pregnant - so she sets husband Mastroianni to ensuring that she's always pregnant whenever the police arrive every 15 months: fine at first, but after six children he can barely stand... The second and shortest, Anna, sees Loren's rich trophy wife trying to convince Mastroianni's journalist that she's not really interested in money only for an accident in her new Rolls Royce to test her real priorities. The final story, Mara, is the one that earned the film its place in the iconic scenes Hall of Fame for the striptease Loren's high-class courtesan performs for Mastroianni's pervy civil servant (something the filmmakers were smart enough to keep for the film's grand finale). It's really almost an afterthought to the plot itself, which sees the disapproving next-door neighbours' grandson decide to chuck in life in the seminary in favour of more earthly pursuits with La Loren...

Unusually for the continental anthology films of the period, Vittorio De Sica directs all three tales, and shows a light, populist touch and a great eye for his locations that yields pleasing results. None of the stories are particularly outstanding in themselves, but they're all played and packaged so likeably that it doesn't matter. Loren and Mastroianni bring different sides of their talents to all three of their roles while oozing screen chemistry together in the process - both stars have rarely been as likeable as they are in the first story - and the whole thing is perfectly packaged. Giuseppe Rotunno's colourful Scope photography and the pleasing score by Armamdo Trovajoli, who cameos as the sports car driver in the second story, keeping things bright, breezy and attractive regardless of the characters' income brackets - De Sica may have made his name with The Bicycle Thieves, but he'd left neo-realism far enough behind by then to ensure that even the poor sections of Naples look gorgeous.

The film has a very chequered history on DVD, with many atrocious Public Domain releases boasting poor picture quality or dubbed soundtracks. Kino Lorber's region-free English subtitled Italian language Blu-ray release may not be perfect, but it's almost certainly the best the film has looked on home video, with a very respectable 2.35:1 transfer that isn't quite as good as some might like but certainly does the film's rich colour scheme justice even if the definition shows the limitations of the cost-cutting Techniscope process used to shoot the film (often dubbed the poor man's CinemaScope, instead of squeezing the image on a single frame with an anamorphic lens, it would print two unsqueezed images on the same area with an ordinary lens, thus using only half the amount of film stock but also ensuring a loss of picture quality as well). A decent package of extras includes the film's Italian trailer (which includes an alternate take of the striptease) as well as trailers for Kino's other Loren titles, a brief stills gallery and, on a separate DVD, a feature length documentary on the director, Vittorio D, which includes interviews with Loren, Clint Eastwood, Woody Allen and others.",1355097600,5,3977,5.0227272727272725
1196846,5,B000007P7Y,"The Italian cinema does not do justice to its own product by all their releasing to various companies and even prematurely to the public domain that produce dubbed or otherwise crappy copies of their films.  This has definitely happened to the work of Vittorio de Sica, perhaps some of his greatest achievements like ""Two Women,"" ""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow"" and even ""Marriage, Italian Style.""  I have seen the beautiful, crisp still photos of ""Marriage, Italian Style"" in the 1964 ""Screen World"" so I know better images exist of this film than in the copy I purchased some years ago.  A reviewer probably prior to the Lorber release of ""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow"" had said the remastered edition was a great transfer, but the Blu-ray by Lorber is pretty good, but not, in my estimation, what these films deserve.  Vittorio de Sica certainly has Fellini beat in my book of presenting Italians in their home country.  And Marcello Mastroianni (Fellini's favorite actor) and Sophia Loren (she definitely deserved the Oscar for ""Two Women"" (what a sin this isn't in a better edition) and her nomination for ""Marriage, Italian Style"") were unbeatable.  ""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow"" has the distinction of winning Best Foreign Film of 1964 (it was released in 1963).  The film unlike ""Marriage, Italian Style"" is episodic, which was fashionable in the Italian cinema and the last episode, ""Mara"" was penned by Cesare Zavattini, who frequently worked with de Sica.  Also the episodes include the work of Alberto Moravia and Eduardo de Filippo with cinematography by Giuseppe Rotunno.  The film is quite good (although there were a lot of continuity mistakes which would have counted today) and the Lorber edition is too, but I wish Carlo Ponti and Joseph E. Levine would appreciate what they had and stop making deals to sell these films to companies that make their film not household names, but household trash.  In Italian with subtitles and trailers.",1342569600,4,1959,5.055900621118012
1196847,3,B000007P7Y,"you go on to write that this film is with Woody Allen and Clint Eastwood, but they never worked with Sophia Loren, I say that because i am fron Italy and I know this film:",1336089600,,171,3.914285714285714
1196848,5,B000007P7Y,"After the impressive success of Bocaccio 70 and Rogopag, the idea of making another set of vigentes seemed to have fashioned in the mind of the great Italian filmmakers. Vittorio de Sica and Cesare Zavatini worked as a team to make one of the most full rounded artistic masterworks of the Italian Cinema in years. Of course you may feel in De Sica a visible Fellinian enchantment with this funny portrait of a minor smuggler of imported cigarettes, who is absolutely convinced she can escape from the legal arm assuming her motherhood over and over. Of course the no sense situations  derived since this surrealistic script is developed until its last consequences by De Sica. De Sica as Buuel, auscultated the Italian society making a visceral dissection on the social mentality with his accurate scalpel, employing his undeniable mastery to carve in relief in Naples a quotidian tragedy masking it of laughable episodes.

In the second episode, Cesare Zavatini explores the existential boredom of the wife of a wealthy industrial magnate. Nothing new under the sun since Antonioni with his previous films such as The Adventure, The eclipse and Fellini with La Dolce Vita had reflected with major extension this crucial dilemma.

But let's be honest: The third chapter of this entry was the funniest of all. A sexy woman who works by dates with high managements manipulates the febrile anxiety state of a Bolognese executive when she (without proposing herself makes a very young aspirant to priest loses his head for her). Mastroianni is extremely funny in his role of desperate and tantalized man and the brief strip tease of Madame Loren will remain for the posterity in one of the most sexiest sequences the cinema reminds.

A winner film under any point of view.",1312761600,,1768,4.962837837837838
1196849,4,B000007P7Y,"Vittorio De Sica, the filmmaker and actor who captured the attention of the world through Italian Neo-Realism with films such as ""Shoeshine"", ""The Bicycle Thief"" and ""Umberto D."".

Known for his neorealist films in the '40s and '50s, by the '60s, De Sica was a man who did what he wanted to do and that meant changing genres and experimenting with various themes.  And in 1961, he would go on to create a film that would feature an all-star Italian and American cast titled ""The Last Judgement"" (Il Giudizio Universale) and also go from creating films about the poor to the people flourishing during the post-war economic boom (known as the Italian Economic Miracle) in which Italy would transform itself to a major industrial power starting from the '50s through the '70s.  A subject that De Sica would focus in his 1963 comedy film ""Il Boom"".

While known for his neorealistic films and also his starring role in the 1957 film ""A Farewell to Arms"" (which De Sica received a ""Best Actor in a Supporting Role"" Academy Award nomination), his 1963 film ""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow"" (Ieri, oggi, domani) would win an Academy Award in 1965 for ""Best Foreign Language Film"".

And although a comedy film, ""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow"" would showcase the poor of Italy but also those who flourished during the post-economic boom but do it with comedy and sexuality by collaborating again with actress Sophia Loren (""Two Women"", ""Boccasio '70', ""Marriage Italian Style"") and actor Marcello Mastroianni (""Divorce Italian Style"", ""La Notte"", ""La Dolce Vita"", ""8 1/2').

To celebrate the working relationship with filmmaker Vittorio De Sica, Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni, Kino Lorber have released three Blu-ray titles and a special four-disc DVD set featuring ""Yesterday Today, Tomorrow"", ""Marriage Italian Style"" and ""Sunflower"") as part of ""The Sophia Loren Award Collection"".

With the release of ""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow"" on Blu-ray, not only is the film included but also the feature-length documentary ""Vittorio D."" about the life and career of Vittorio De Sica.

VIDEO:

""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:35:1).  First of all, it's important to note that while Kino has released several Blu-rays (many which are silent films), one should not expect a complete overhaul in terms of picture quality.

For ""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow"", its important to note that the film is shot in Techniscope 2-perf, which means that for production back in 1963, the film crew went for economical means than high quality.  So, expect to see a good amount of grain and colors that looks soft and not too pristine.  Also, Kino doesn't go all out in trying to clean up the video of white specks or other problems in the film like the Criterion Collection or Masters of Cinema but for the most part, they do make sure that films meet a certain level before releasing it on Blu-ray.

With that being said, this is the best version of ""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow"" to date!  There was an issue of green colors or an aged look in previous video releases and for this Kino Lorber release, colors are much more vibrant and black levels are very good.  While the first and third story for me were the best in picture quality, still...early '60s Italy looks very good on Blu-ray!  And yes, Sophia Loren also looks fantastic as well!

As for ""Vittorio D."", as mentioned, Kino has high standards of what films will be released on Blu-ray and documentaries typically are given the DVD treatment.  Instead of adding the DVD with the Blu-ray release, Kino chose to give more space to the film, while putting the documentary in an included DVD disc.  Picture quality for this documentary is good but a reminder that footage comes from various sources throughout Vittorio De Sica's life, so video quality varies.  But for the most part, picture quality on DVD for the documentary is good.

AUDIO:

""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow"" is presented in Italian Dolby TrueHD 1.0.  The lossless monaural track is still clear in dialogue.  From Mara singing in third story to the dialogue, everything comes quite clear through the center channel.  Granted, I did choose to watch the entire film in stereo on all channels for a more immersive soundscape.

I didn't notice any hissing, pops or crackle and for the most part, soundtrack is what I was expecting from the lossless monaural soundtrack.

As for ""Vittorio D."", audio is good on the DVD is good and dialogue for the documentary is clear.

Optional English subtitles are included.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

On both the Blu-ray and the DVD are trailers for ""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow"", ""Marriage Italian Style"" and ""Sunflower"".  Also, included are stills for the film.  Of course, the most significant extra in this Blu-ray release is the inclusion of the ""Vittorio D"" documentary.  I personally would have bought this documentary alone but the fact that it's included in this release is fantastic!

EXTRAS:

""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow"" comes with a slipcase.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I am a big fan of Vittorio De Sica's films and while many who are previously familiar with his neorealist films may be craving for another serious film about postwar Italy, with ""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow"", De Sica does explore socioeconomic issues but does so in the form of a comedy anthology.

There is no doubt in my mind that when people came out to see this film, the fact that Sophia Loren was the most talked about thing about the entire film tells you what to expect.  The curvaceous Sophia Loren wearing next to nothing is no doubt going to be quite titillating to men and the fact that even today, Sophia Loren's kinky dance during her Mara storyline continues to be a source of inspiration, especially how it was recreated in Robert Altman's ""Ready to Wear"" film.

And while the film did win an Academy Award back in 1964 for ""Best Foreign Language Film"", many may be wondering if this is cinema kitsch or cinema worth owning because of Vittorio De Sica's name is behind it.

First, I will say that I'm quite happy that the film is an anthology and has three separate stories.  I don't know if I could have watched a feature length on either story as the first is an interesting take on a family's way to prevent jail time for the family matriarch.  The answer is to keep getting pregnant and while it seems so farfetched, having friends who have had many children (all girls) in order to get a boy, I can see people of a lower socioeconomic class doing the same.  But a storyline is much more comedy than drama and seeing Naples of a long ago, may interest many, but I have no doubt in my mind, many who tuned in for Sophia Loren will be happy.

The second story takes on the socioeconomic boom of Italy.  The short story takes place in Milan and features a very wealthy Anna in her Rolls Royce and yes, she is a brat when it comes to her possessions.  The fact that she cares more about her car and would rather have the man she is having an affair with hit the boy instead of getting an accident, kind of puts a bad taste in your mouth of Anna's character but then again, the story plays on the storyline of wealthy people who don't have a heart.

This second story is the weakest but it is the shortest of the three.

The final third story is perhaps my favorite.  Sophia Loren just dazzles the screen as the prostitute Mara and Marcello Mastroianni does a fantastic job of playing the horny Augusto.  No punches are pulled as we can definitely see how badly Augusto wants to get laid and how much of a tease that Sophia Loren can play onscreen.  But the fact that she is barely wearing anything in this short is possibly won many fans back then and it will do so today.  The kinky dance strip routine by Loren is unforgettable and overall, both Loren and Mastroianni did a wonderful job.

In the end, ""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow"" does not have the drama and the heartwrenching scenes of any of De Sica's neorealist films but that is fine!  De Sica is known for taking on a variety of genres and while some of his comedies were OK, this one is a bit more accessible because its an anthology and sex is the driving force for this film and no doubt, it titillated many men back then and for those who never experienced a Sophia Loren film that showcases her beauty and sexual attraction, this film is the one you want to watch.

For the most part, Vittorio De Sica did a great job in directing the film and getting the best out of his two major talents.  But while I do feel that Hiroshi Teshigahara's ""Woman in the Dunes"" or even Jacques Demy's ""The Umbrellas of Cherbourg"" were a better film for me compared to ""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow"", there's no denying that this film is charming and fun!

And for this Blu-ray release, the fact that Kino Lorber included the magnificent ""Vittorio D."" feature-length documentary is fantastic!  As mentioned, I would have bought this documentary on its own but the fact that it does come with this Blu-ray release is wonderful!

Overall, ""Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow"" on Blu-ray features one of Sophia Loren's shining moments in film but bundled with the Vittorio De Sica documentary, easily elevates this Blu-ray release as a must-buy for Vittorio De Sica fans!

Highly recommended!",1312156800,3,9301,4.757009345794392

Everything about this DVD is just wrong and inexcusable: the menu looks tacky, the quality of the film is just terrible, the color looks faded, half the time it is hard to even tell what is going on because the film is so blurry, and the dubbing is just ghastly. The quality basically looks like a really old VHS tape. The sound is also just terrible. DVD issues aside, I really wasn't expecting this movie to be so terrible, considering that it won an Academy Award. Sorry, I don't care how wonderful and buxom the actresses look, this film is rubbish. The stories are just ridiculously stupid and uninteresting. There's something about it that is just so dated and unwatchable. And the stories don't even relate to one another, let alone the title. This was just a waste of time. Goes to show that in SOME cases, just because a film won awards and may be considered a classic doesn't mean that it is actually good. I think most to blame is really just the terrible quality of this DVD, but at the same time, even if the DVD were better, I just wouldn't like this movie, it was terrible.",1279843200,,1146,4.436018957345971
1196856,4,B000007P7Y,"Now 66 I saw this movie in Florida on a vacation.  First time I saw Sophia Loren.  Being half Italian,  I was hopeful I would someday look like her LOL  Didn't happen,  but she was the most beautiful lady I ever saw.  I was about 10 years old and this movie had a great affect on me.  Besides Sophia Loren's ability to be beautiful while tears rolled down her cheeks,  the music and scenery was breath taking.  Sophia's presence was powerful, besides her beautiful body,  there was an intense feeling about her,  and one knew, even a pre-teen like myself,  that she would someday be a great actress.  Maybe if I were a boy,  I would just notice her sensual body,  but being a girl and very observant, I saw a Beautiful Lady.  Sophia's body always outshone her talent to be a good Actress,  and back in them days, sex sold as it still does,  but at least now women are recognized more for their acting abilities.  I hope so anyway.  And now at 66 and an Artist.  the scenery still stands out in my memory.

In 1960, Loren went back to Italy to film the World War II film ""Two Women."" A year and a half later, to everybody's surprise she won the Oscar for Best Actress and became the first foreigner of that era to win the Academy Award. But if there was one film that summed up just how damn sexy Sophia Loren was, it came with ""Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow."" The scene in which she strips in front of Marcello Mastronini's character has to be considered the greatest strip scene in film history and also the most sexiest in film history too (Hope PREMIERE magazine does a list like it someday). And that is the scene in which you say to everybody, ""This is Sophia Loren."" In my opinion, Loren may have been the first actress in movie history to be on-screen in their lingerie.

1196905,2,B000007P7Y,"Yes this was dubbed and would have been much better with subtitles.  The really disappointing aspect is the very poor quality of the video picture.  The quality does not even rise to the level of an old VHS copy.  It is not only very poor, but the picture tends to jump and skip.  The colors are faded and the sound quality is also poor.  The technical defects render this product almost unwatchable.",1112832000,5,400,4.5
1196906,5,B000007P7Y,"Most of the Amazon reviews linked to this new Region 1 DVD from NoShame films refer to the awful bootleg versions that have been previously available.  Ignore them!

This DVD is gorgeous - with a beautiful 16x9 Widescreen (2.35:1) high definition transfer.  There is an Italian track with optional English subtitles. There is also the option to choose the English dubbed track if you want to.

NoShame is also releasing a pristine version of the Fellini/Visconti/DeSica multi-part comedy Boccaccio '70 completely uncut for the first time ever in the U.S. The long missing Mario Monicelli segment has finally been restored as well!",1111968000,143,630,5.147058823529412
1196907,4,B000007P7Y,"(Revised review for Remastered DVD released May 2005) Here in this charming masterpiece from Vittorio De Sica we are treated to not one but three classic performances by the great team of Mastroianni and Loren.
This new release of the restored film is magnificent, beautiful color, Widescreen and great-restored sound. You can watch the film in Italian with English subtitles or, watch it dubbed in English. Sophia has given us a superb performance in both Italian and English! Now that in itself is a miracle by anyone but in her hands it is wondrous.
  Every aspect of this film is a delight, from the direction, music score by Armando Trovajoli, and the top-notch performances by the entire cast. Here we are presented with an almost forgotten gem of Italian cinema that needs to be preserved and treasured.
This look at love and survival by women in three strata of Italian society of the early 1960's is both funny and insightful. In many ways this is an Italian neo-realist comedy and it succeeds as both a social commentary and a social farce. Each tale is finely crafted in the most basic and important area of film; a fine screenplay is it's stalwart foundation. And here executed by Billa Billa, Eduardo DeFilipo, Alberto Moravia, Isabella Quarantotti, and Cesare Zavattini is a collaborators dream. It seems odd that so many writers were able to turn in a little gem for the great De Sica to play with. But they did, and he plays it like the master filmmaker he is.
As for Sophia and Marcello, well I don't want to spoil a moment of this romp. I will just say this; it's Magic, Italian Style.",1110412800,6,1603,4.680851063829787
1196908,1,B000007P7Y,"I bought this DVD because of the new (2005) cover, thinking that it was a new release. Which, hopefully, would correct all the problems mentioned in previous reviews. The reviews were helpful, and the reason why I didn't purchase until now. What a scam! The quality is just as bad as everyone said, only the cover is new. It's bad enough what a travesty it is to do this to a great film, but to repackage the some old, same old is adding insult to injury! Why can't Criterion get hold of a decent negative and bring this masterpiece out with their usual excellence? The film itself is wonderful, the best of the best of Italian cinema. The DVD transfer is unforgivable. Don't waste your money. Someone should sue...",1110326400,5,715,4.550387596899225

1196910,1,B000007P7Y,"It is tragic to see that such a great Sophia Loren flick has been
reduced to this awful transfer on DVD.
Don't buy this DVD, the picture quality is so bad that the entire
movie is out of focus, fuzzy, blurry and hurts your eyes. The sound is all distorted as well.
This DVD is from a company called Entertainment Programs Inc., in California and they have obviously transfered a pan/scan version of a really bad washed out VHS tape on  this DVD.
The Picture and the sound quality is worst than a VHS tape recorded in slow mode. I am surprised that Amazon is actually selling this junk.
This is the worst DVD transfer I have ever seen.
I have a VHS version of this movie and the VHS tape is much
better. Hope some reliable company will transfer this gem of a movie on a real high quality DVD, in the meantime save your money and watch your VHS tape. Don't buy this DVD, it is really bad
quality.",1101686400,16,894,4.228070175438597
1196911,1,B000007P7Y,"I believe the Amazon.com Editorial Review is self explanatory. This film is a masterpiece, an important component of Sofia Loren's filmography and one of her most admired performances.

Now let's address this DVD release! It was apparently transfered from deteriorated film elements, horrendous (jolts) pan and scan with an annoying monophonic dubbed soundtrack. This DVD release does not do justice to this Italian cinematographic jewel. It should not be in the market. Perhaps it is best to visit Italy, buy its PAL version and play it back in one of today's fine multi region DVD players. Don't spend a penny on this monstruosity.",1091059200,22,633,5.145631067961165
1196912,5,B000007P7Y,"My rating is for the fil, because if I wee to judge it on the technical merits of the tape we'd be speaking litreally a different language.  i am very familair with the story of the woman who kept getting preganant eo avoid going to jail, as she was a clinet of my lawyer grandfather.  The fil's stry was actually negititaed in his office and I have a picture of De Sica, Loren and My grandfather Andrea della Pietra in my room.  The fact that it is real majkkes the movie even more fun.  Like many other good Italkioan films it shows the inherent spirit of survival - and defiance of authority - of Italians and Neapolitans like myself in particular.  I don't think Sophia is the most beautuiful italian actress (I find Claudia cardianle and Sylvia Koscina more striking from those of her generation) but she's definetely worth looking at.  Unfortunatley the dubbing robs the character out of the dialogue that normally features neapolitan dialect with vert colourful expressions.  Peccato!",1007164800,7,991,4.760233918128655
