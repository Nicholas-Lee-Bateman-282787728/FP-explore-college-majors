8729132,4,B013XDC28S,"Arrow Video are very good at remastering old crime and exploitation classics and breathing new life into them. This is from 1966 and stars Austrian actor Robert Hoffman as Luciano Lutring  he was a famous jewellery thief who used a sub machine gun for some of his heists. He was seen as a romantic figure at the time  though God only knows why. He did work at a dairy before he met his future wife. This is the singer - at the less salubrious venues  Yvonne, played by Lisa Gastroni . He falls in love with her and then decides to give her everything fabulous by stealing it.

He gets involved with other gangs and goes on a crime spree across Europe but mainly France and Italy. The film tells his story and it does it in a style that was very much the sixties. Lutring is a bit of a misogynist with a violent temper but Hoffman plays him brilliantly. Those of a certain age will remember him from the sixties TV series Robinson Crusoe that was a staple of childrens summer TV on the BBC etc.  There are some continuity errors and the plot seems to jump in places but they are fairly minor in the overall scheme.

The quality of the print does vary from excellent to passable which is fine for a transfer of a film this old. The sound is all dubbed as was the way then but I got used to that fairly quickly too. It is also a great time capsule with regards to the fashions, the cars, music dancing  everything. At two hours too I felt this may out stay its welcome but far from it. This is one for those who love Italian crime capers of a certain era, but do not expect modern techniques to be on show here and you will be far from disappointed  recommended.",1456790400,,1659,4.211356466876971
8729133,4,B013XDC28S,"Sure, Wake Up and Die isn't a movie without its length, and sometimes it manages to tell its straightforward story a bit on the confusing, over-convoluted side - but that said, it's also all that made European genre cinema of the era so great: The leads are all the epitome of cool, the locations are priceless, the vintage cars great, plus the movie contains several sequences that are pulse-pounding to this very day (not only but especially the finale). And add to this a very elegant direction, a very clever screenplay, palpable characters that are neither black nor white (like most of us), and a first rate cast ... and basically you've got a movie that's pretty much pure excitement!",1450137600,,691,4.766666666666667
8729134,5,B013XDC28S,"New from Arrow Films is another obscure classic from the Italian crime genre - Wake Up and Kill (Svegliati e uccidi). Not really a polizioteschi, more of a violent docu-drama, but still a wonderful slice of 60's Spaghetti action. Directed by Carlo Lizzani (Requiescant), this film pre-dates many of the classic Italian crime films that came after, but no doubt features lots of what makes them great.

Wake Up and Kill stars ""Alain Delon-lookalike"" Robert Hoffman (who I recently watched in Umberto Lenzi's trippy giallo Spasmo) as Luciano Lutring, a small time jewelry thief who, despite his hot temper, can't seem to get caught. He falls for a night club singer (Lisa Gastoni) who desperately tries to change him, but still supports him even when he becomes headline news. Luciano has to flea the country and ends up entangled with other groups of criminals who use his infamy to their advantage.

Wake Up and Kill is quite different than what I was expecting. Missing is the bloody violence, scantily clad women and simple story of your typical Italian Crime film. This one is far more dramatic, with complicated characters and a gripping story. If I had to compare this to one other film, I would compare it to the Giuliano Carnimeo's Secrets of a Call Girl, which was far deeper and character driven than I expected. I might even compare it to Lizzani's own early Bandits in Milan, which itself had a pseudo documentary feel (though much more pronounced). The cast here, especially Hoffman, Gastoni and one of my favorites Gian Maria Volonte (as the cop who tries to help Lutring's wife bring him in) are very convincing and carry the admittedly long running time (over 2 hours). I should also mention another great performance in Claudio Camaso (ne' Volonte - Gian Maria's brother) who plays Gastoni's ex flame and thorn in Lutring's side. Also worth mentioning is a classic score by the great Ennio Morriccone.

As with all of Arrow's releases I have seen, this release is nothing short of spectacular with two cuts of the film and a wealth of extras. Amazing for such and obscure film, but one that deserves it nonetheless. Full list of Extras are:

THE FILM - [ 3 / 5 ]:

During the 1960s Luciano Lutring committed more than one hundred armed robberies in Italy and on the French Riviera. To the media he was the machine gun soloist, a name hed earned as he kept his weapon in a violin case. To the public he was a romantic figure, one who only targeted the wealthy, stealing more than 35 billion lire during his criminal career.

Wake Up and Kill was the logical extension of such fame. It became the first feature to commit Lutrings story to celluloid, shooting having begun mere months after his eventual arrest. Capitalizing on the breakthrough success of his performance in French televisions ""The Adventures of Robinson Crusoe,"" Robert Hoffmann is perfect as Lutring, bringing just the right amount of charisma and youthful exuberance to his first major big screen role.

Directed by Carlo Lizzani (""Requiescant"" which we also reviewed), scored by the legend Ennio Morricone, penned by the future screenwriter of ""Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion,"" and featuring that films star, Gian Maria Volont, in a key supporting role, Wake Up and Kills true-crime thrills serve as an enthralling dry run for the poliziotteschi movies that would follow a few years later.

The longer original Italian language version of ""Wake Up and Kill"" has a running time of 2:03:51 while the shorter English language cut runs 1:37:38. I thought that the longer version tends to get a little boring at times, so the English cut does feel like a tighter film and of course moves at a brisker pace with the reduced run time. I tend to prefer more footage in films mostly because of that need to see more, however in this case as sometimes with others, I feel that less is more. So while some parts of the story may be truncated, the quicker pace is more appealing to me.

Ennio Morricone's score is as usual, a joy to listen to and helps provide added tension and drama in the right places, specially at the end of the film when things come to a head and Lutring is literally running for his life. Robert Hoffman is terrific in his portrayal of Luciano Lutring. At times he is very charismatic and likable and at others he is downright despicable and loathsome. Lisa Gastoni plays Yvonne, also known as Angela, as a woman who has very bad taste in men as she goes from being the girlfriend of a known criminal to thinking she found her knight in shining armor in Lutring, only to find out he is far from the wholesome hero she thought he was.

AUDIO - [ 3 / 5 ]:

""Wake Up And Kill"" features two LPCM audio tracks with each track appearing on their respective versions of the film. The audio has the typical odd sound to it due to the method of recording audio often used during the time period. While the audio may not wow you, it is above average and also sounds fairly clean. I cannot speak for the Italian version since I do not speak it but the English version was easy to hear and understand. I did think that sometimes the sound effects were a little louder than they should be but it was not a real problem. I did not encounter any issues with the audio in the form of drop outs, hissing or other problems. Both versions of the film have English subtitles available.

VIDEO - [ 4 / 5 ]:

""Wake Up And Kill"" comes to Blu-ray thanks to Arrow Video via a brand new 2K restoration from the films original camera negative. The film is presented in 1080p with a 1.85:1 Aspect Ratio. First off, the picture quality overall is very good. There are some areas that may draw complaints such as the drab colors during most of the film and the amount of film grain present. In both cases I think both are there for legitimate reasons. Color appearing in this type of film from this era were often subdued and not bright and bold. As for the film grain, that is inherent in the film stock that was used and speaking for myself, I would rather have excess grain than have an attempt to clean it up using some type of DNR. You may be able to see some of what I am talking about in the included screenshots.

Otherwise the film does feature a fair amount of detail throughout and a significant amount of fine detail in close ups. In darker scenes black levels are a bit muddled at times and are not particularly strong. They do fare better in brighter scenes. There are many instances of white specks appearing throughout the film.

SPECIAL FEATURES - [ 2 / 5 ]:

Unlike typical Arrow Video releases that are chock-full of extras, this release is notably light in that department. However there are two cuts of the film included as previously mentioned.

This release also features reversible cover art including the original art and newly commissioned artwork by Reinhard Kleist.

IN CONCLUSION:

Another nice release by Arrow Video. The film looks very good thanks to their new 2K scan from the original camera negative. While light on extras, this Blu-ray features the original Italian version as well as the English cut of the film. If you enjoy poliziotteschi type films, I think you will like this one too. This Blu-ray and DVD Combo Pack is available in the US and UK.
