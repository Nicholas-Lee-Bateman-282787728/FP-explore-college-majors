8394359,5,B003CP1SSS,"A timely, graphic but limited account of the January 2010 earthquake in Port au Prince.  Not deeply informative but the images and footage were moving, if not disturbing.  The best documentary of the earthquake I have come across.  Worth the purchase, in my opinion.",1280448000,2,266,5.0
