7710097,4,B01DALQ0SQ,"Syfy's hottest movie is Dead 7! This movie has everything: zombies, an apocalypse that means in the future we live like the wild west, blood and gore, humor, former boyband members, and lots of cleavage. It is exactly what you would expect from Asylum films, the company who also brought us such gems like ""Sharknado"". I highly recommend this film if you like boybands from the 90's. We get appearances from members of the Backstreet Boys, NSYNC, O-Town; and even Jon Secada! Joey Fatone drinks too much whiskey! AJ wears creepy makeup and laughs maniacally! Nick Carter cradles Jeff Timmons in his arms! Who didn't dream of that happening back in the day? Plus somehow the Backstreet Boys got hotter as they aged, so Nick is a sexy gunslinger, AJ totally rocks his psycho role, and Howie looks amazing as a hot sharpshooter. There is something for everyone!!",1461110400,6,859,4.8108108108108105
7710098,3,B01DALQ0SQ,"The title fits neatly in between ""The Hateful 8"" and ""The Ridiculous 6."" This is a SyFy Asylum zombie western and basically that is all you need to know about quality. A group of humans with special killing skills decide to take the zombie war to Apocalypta (Debra Wilson) who leads an army of zombies with a human (A.J. McLean) controller in clown face. The film is mostly fighting and killing, as in don't get attached to any of the characters.

The slow moving zombies are called ""Copperheads"" like the snake except it refers to the fact they worked in the copper mines of Montana, which appears to be the cause, although explanations don't abound on how a remote local outbreak lead to a worldwide disaster. Clever name,but leaves a plot hole.

Okay to watch if you like a spoof on TV zombie episodes done in a tame grindhouse style, i.e. no nudity. There is a brothel scene with simulated clothed sex. Plenty of head explosions and blood.",1460937600,4,943,4.607142857142857

7710166,3,B01DALQ0SQ,"This was made for the SyFy Channel by The Asylum, a low-rent production company that specializes in ""Mockbusters"". Transformers was big so they made Transmorphers. In the same spirit they have made films like Alien vs Hunter, Almighty Thor, Paranormal Entity, Independent's Day and Ghosthunters. They have also been making Z-Nation for SyFy, who have now signed a feature producing agreement. They made Zombie Night, a film that wasted the talents of a number of well-known names. This too seems to be a work of clever casting, this time with former members of boy-bands, which gets more attention for the film than had it been cast with unknowns. In this case it's a bit more legit since it was written by Nick Carter, who also got his wife cast as Sirene.

We have three former Backstreet Boys here along with guys from N'Sync, 98 Degrees and O-Town. To be honest I was never into the boy-band thing but for those who were I'm sure it adds an extra kick. For me however, it's just a zombie movie. As these go it's mildly entertaining and the technical work of the Asylum is competent so you don't suddenly find yourself in the world of absolute incompetence. It is set in what looks like a town in a Western because the apocalypse has been going on a while now, so the whole thing has a Western flavor even though they have running cars.

 Nevertheless it gets off to a bad start right away when a horde of zombies attacks a town seemingly by just opening an unguarded gate. There seem to be no lookouts or guards, nobody carrying weapons or any other sign of preparedness one might expect when a zombie apocalypse has been going on for years. The zombies are called ""Copperheads"" because men who worked in the copper mines were infected by the copper dust they got on their heads. But since there aren't copper mines all over the place this begs the question of how the whole world got infected.  When evil #2 bad guy Johnny Vermillion (A.J.McLean in whiteface, tattoos and makeup and everything but a bone through his nose) they don't just kill him right then and there. No, they put him in an unguarded cell and leave him there till they can hang him the next day, which is to say so he can break out and cause more trouble. It's that dumb.

So what transpires is an action-type zombie film where a band of seven disparate heroes unite to free the town from the zombie plague. Coincidentally, the remake of The Magnificent Seven came out recently and is a hit. What happens need not be gone into here only to say that it is as dumb and full of holes as the opening. Oh, and these zombies are led by an evil witch-woman, Apocalypta (Debra Wilson) who is always wildly over-the-top. The whole thing, while not a zombie comedy, is infected by a kind of campy silliness that has crept into zombie films lately, kind-of like, ""Look, we're making a zombie movie!"" that prevents anything from mattering at all.

Because it's technically proficient it's worth a watch for mindless entertainment or mild humor, but is not a serious zombie film.",1475625600,7,3040,4.579044117647059

8755378,3,B01DALQ0SQ,"First off, im a zombie fanatic which means i watch a ton of trash in hope of a pleasant surprise. I heard about this from a good friend that listens to a podcast. I was shocked to see them act pretty decent more like 2.5 stars. I mean its not th best, but you could see they were having fun, and trying to do there best. I dug the whole ""Chapter X"" with a description. That just got me smiling, and thought it was a clever ingredient to the b-/c+ rated fun. I will say that the bad guys drove me nuts with apocalyptica's crazy growls and way over the top voice. Then the other dude with painted white face's laugh. Yet, may be done that way so we can see them die grusomely. I didn't mind the goofiness, cgi zombie kils, or the cheese for some reason. I guess some will not dig it, and then the interpretation of their zombie style will aggrovate traditional lovers. The taming of them with some intelligent ones, oh and how some attack or walk right by the heroes. I say to just enjoy whats playing, and watch the old singers from back in the day do their thing. You pop this in expecting a ton then just pop it right back out. You should see the cover oozes goofiness, but if you dig a cheesy b-/c+ zombie movie then have fun with this, and remember who is acting.
