920980,5,6304766793,"This independent film portrays the many fears and challenges associated with today's adolescents. Patton-Spruill vividly recounts how three youth  (a/k/a ""PG-13 Crew"") become involved with gangs, drugs and  violence. Considering the age and the harrowing accounts portrayed in the  film, one begins to realize the impressionability of youth in general.  Consequently, Patton-Spruill enables the viewer to understand the reasons  behind the youth's decisions, and how easily they were trapped.  However,  getting them out alive is even harder, if not impossible.  Patton-Spruill  incorporates how the community can help these youth and provides hope for  the future.",965692800,2,665,5.905263157894737
920981,5,6304766793,"After recently seeing ""Squeeze"" for the first time I was in awe at how realistic this film was, and how much I could relate to what went on in the film, partially to the fact that it was filmed in and around my  neighborhood in Dorchester, MA. As someone who has lived in this. community  for 26 years I can tell you this movies is as real as it gets.  ""Squeeze"" chronicles the lives of three inner city youths who  hang out at a gas station all day and pan handle for change until one one  of the youths is harassed by the neighborhood thug/drug dealer. His pride  hurt he decides to get revenge on one of the thugs crew members, which  escalates to heights the youths hadn't expected.  The acting is superb and  the story realistic (take it from someone who knows first-hand). I highly  recommend this film to anyone who want's to see how things truly are on the  street",947376000,,872,4.320987654320987

7876843,4,6304766793,"I treated children and teens, most in foster care, for 13 years, before exchanging that urgent, wretchedly-paid work for private practice.  I saw ""She's Gotta Have It"" the night it opened in New York (at Cinema Studio, for those who remember standing in line), so like Mr. Merl I want something that sticks to the ribs.  For me, ""Squeeze"" (which I really do think was titled ""Squeezed"" when Miramax dumped it to cable without really releasing it: I kept the VHS copy I made, even though it's been a few years since I tossed the VCR) remains memorable--the mother, the social worker, the desperation of the boy who wants out.  I've seen other movies that now exist only in blurry YouTube uploads, and someday this will probably be lost and forgotten like the majority of the pre-talkie films.  It's not the best ever made, but doesn't deserve to be forgotten.",1490918400,,858,4.7

7876845,1,6304766793,It was not the right movie. It was supposed to be the squeeze that came out in 1997 with tyrone burton. I was upset when the wrong item came.,1390435200,,141,3.896551724137931
7876846,3,6304766793,"I enjoyed this movie. But, it's only been a few weeks since I watched it and I can't really remember any of the characters. I realize that it's a low budget production, but low budget doesn't have to mean non-compelling characters. I can still remember just about every character in ""She's Gotta Have it"", and I watched it twenty years ago.",1241136000,,340,4.590163934426229

7876848,4,6304766793,This is a great movie. It's hard to grow up when you live in a neighborhood like this. In my opinion the movie is very realistic in a lot of ways and as a social worker I can say that I've seen a lot of these lives.,1181174400,,215,3.595744680851064
