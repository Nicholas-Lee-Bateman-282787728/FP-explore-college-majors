4154064,5,B003LV2W3S,"In the midst of constantly deteriorating economic news and partisan finger-pointing, this film peels away the superficial aspects of the crisis and reveals the underlying cultural changes that led to the financial meltdown of 2008, and it does so in a refreshingly non-partisan manner.  The failures of major financial institutions and the resulting bailouts were not, as the old media suggested, indicative of the failure of capitalism; they were, instead, indicative of a narcissistic, self-centered trend in American culture that had been emerging since the days of Woodstock.  Politicians and Wall Street insiders who were products of that cultural trend changed the old rules of risk and reward in their favor, and the consequences were disastrous.  The film is technically superb; its fast pace and visual intensity fit the gravity of the subject matter without sacrificing the depth of the analysis.  It is a must-watch for anyone seeking a deeper understanding of the causes of America's economic predicament and the sobering implications for future generations.",1339286400,8,1070,5.466666666666667
4154065,3,B003LV2W3S,"The facts as presented are moderatly accurate.  The interpretation is inaccurate.  It is not that both parties lack the guts to address the financial problem.  It is that both parties are interested in getting reelected and in political power.  By pressuring corporations into making ill advised loans, the government is in a position where they can't lose.  If a financial crisis occurs, blame greedy companies.  Then you can institute payoffs to your political buddies and label the thing a bailout.  If things worsen, blame others and ask for more power (to fix things).

The diatrible against the horrid late 60s is irrelevant, though fairly accuate.  It has nothing to do with the government created mess we are in.  For an accurate look at the late 60s, read Diana West's incomparable The Death of the Grown-Up.  Boomers didn't create this (unless you count boomers in government - specifically the Federal Government).

One final point.  The theory that the people in power want an economic disaster so that they can take over is idiotic.  They ARE in power.  Their desire is to create a socialist utopia.  The disaster is due to the unworkability of that hypothesis and the fact that these true believers are too stupid to see that.  I recommend that citizens mistrust business and corporations.  I recommend that they mistrust government even more.  Remember: deficits occur when you spend more than you take in and nothing prevents that - no matter how much revenue you raise.  Deficit spending buys votes.",1338595200,12,1516,4.988
4154066,1,B003LV2W3S,"Like most things born of Fox News et al. this is an interesting story devoid of any hard fact to tie together the hypotheses the narrators put forward.  Anyway, here is the central theme of the film:

The 2008 financial meltdown is the direct result of overprotective mothers in the 1950's.

I am not joking.",1324857600,8,308,4.5636363636363635
4154067,5,B003LV2W3S,"This movie is an important work that does an excellent job of staying constructive in its analysis.

4154071,5,B003LV2W3S,I just finished watching this documentary. I cannot think of anything more visually and musically moving. Generation Zero is absolutely superb and with great men such as Victor Davis Hanson gracing its frames it could not possibly be improved upon. I personally wish to thank both its director and producer. This work could not be better than it is. The sixties generation has been a plague on the west and the most destructive group of miscreants to disgrace America since the days of slavery. Now time is overtaking the baby boomers and their marginalization is something that not only I--but every living American--should eagerly await. Thank God for the mortality of humans. Let us bury this rabble and begin anew in the decades to come.,1280016000,4,741,4.936

4154073,5,B003LV2W3S,"""The most important movie of the year"" -James Pinkerton,Fox News  ""You must see this film"" -Glenn Beck

""The current economic crisis is not a failure of Capitalism, but a failure of Culture. Generation Zero explores the cultural roots of the global financial meltdown, -beginning with the narcissism of the 1960's, spreading like a virus through the self-indulgent 90's, and exploding across the world in the present economic cataclysm. Generation Zero goes beneath the headlines and talking-head sound bites, to get you to the source of today's economic nightmare. With cutting-edge style and haunting imagery, this must-see documentary will change everything you thought you knew about Wall Street and Washington.  Featuring experts, authors, and pundits from across the political spectrum, Generation Zero exposes the little-told story of how the mindset of the baby-boomers sowed the seeds of economic disaster that will be reaped by coming generations.""

This amazing film by Citizens United basically takes you through time (in the U.S.) from right after WWII to current times. In that, it depicts the 4 inevitable stages or eras of the rise and fall of a (our) great civilization, called 'THE TURNINGS', each lasting about 20 yrs. The 1st (or last) Turning is the CRISIS (generally war), then a society re-assesses the (horrific crisis) and will re-organize and consolidate, and goes into the HIGH (as in the 50's), then comes the AWAKENING, then the UN-RAVELING, and then (back to)the Crisis. Apparently we have now entered into the CRISIS. We are reminded that ""There is a time and season  for everything, a time to tear down and a time to mend, a time to keep silent and a time to speak, a time for war and a time for peace....""
  This EXCELLENT and gripping film helps one to clearly understand chronologically what happened through the last 60 years, both psychologically and economically, and how one tied into the other.
Woodstock, the Radical activists who's concepts shaped and influence today, the self indulgent mindset of the baby-boomers, the Dot-Com bubble, housing and banking crisis, to the current global economic meltdown, -its all in there, and explains how they collectively got us to where we are today. Party neutral.

4154079,5,B003LV2W3S,"This DVD ""Generation Zero"" is right on, wheather you like it or not. I have watched it unfold over my life time and it is explained so that even a skeptic can understand how it takes place. It shows that the system we live in was not made for us but for the 6% that have controll of the wealth. The sixtys generation has ruled the system over the last sixty years, ""the drug generation"" scary to think, that thinking they have morals, they have no morals. No morals, no shame and do what thou wilt attitude, doing what's right in there own eyes, is the steady decline of the world system. Common sence isn't common anymore. The natural progression of sin is downward. The trouble is there is no turning back. When man stops beliving in God, he belives in nothing.
We are not just headed into financial armargeddon but into armargeddon itself, with no bail out. Irresponsible behaviour is the perfect arrangement for ethical and moral hazzord for cause and effect. Greed causes WAR. Greed now runs rampant, the system can't handle the strain and will collaps. Bankruptcy isn't even close to what is coming next. Instead of calling this planet Earth, it should be called Casino. Maybe, just maybe the Bible is true. Political promise is a lie, history will repeat itself. One good problem with this documentary is, it is true. The system will collaps, just when, soon. No doom and gloom just truth, are you ready.""Therefore be ye also ready; for in such an hour as ye think not the Son of man cometh""",1374364800,9,1498,4.5724907063197024

4154081,5,B003LV2W3S,"While some reviews seem to fixate on the generational warfare there is far more to the troubles that lead us to the failure that has destroyed the equity in our homes, stagnated the economy, and provides diminishing opportunity to future generations.

The one issue that I feel was really not given the proper attention is the whole notion of ""free-trade"" which the documentary does judge as non-existent in reality. The reality is that we have become a debtor nation buying consumer products produced elsewhere, primarily in China. The trade is one way, from China to the U.S. Until we address the free-trade and the continued push toward globalism that only benefits the wealthiest on the planet, nothing will change. There will be ever increasing numbers of the permanently un-employed who become what is known as the dependent class who rely on government for their day to day survival.

The other important issue is the subsidies of the wealthy who take unmanageable risks knowing that the government will bail them out. We have the too big to fails continuing their games of speculation, driving up the cost of oil that trickles down to all other aspects of our economy. We have HSBC doing back room deals with Mexican drug lords and Iran who are too big to prosecute. Until we manage to rip government out of the grasp of corporate control, the bubbles will only continue to pop putting us deeper and deeper in a debt that generations cannot even hope to repay.",1360540800,17,1468,4.821428571428571
4154082,1,B003LV2W3S,"Tried to watch this tripe last night. Citizens United (the very same group that brought us ""Corporations are People""--even though they have zero liability) dishes out some doozies here, right up there with ""legitimate rape."" Within the first 10 minutes you are greeted with mind numbing silliness...

1) It was the tree hugging hippies that caused the financial meltdown.

2) It could not have been greed that caused the meltdown because people have always been greedy.

And this whopper...

3) Newt ""I screwed my wives in more ways than most people can conceive"" Gingrich will lecture you on narcissism. (To be fair, he is an expert on it.)

American has a viable social safety net that will work for decades to come; let the righties destroy it and there will be nothing there for young people to look forward to after a lifetime of hard work.
