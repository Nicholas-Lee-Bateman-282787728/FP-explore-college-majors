Archive and Doctumentary Dvd collection being the MARVELLOUS GEM of this wonderful box set, never seen ANY of this before. All MJ fans should own this one. A BIG thank you to the MJ fan that put this one together.

Oh forgot to say the Awards Dvd here is BRILLIANT as well.

MICHAEL JACKSON - a fan's collection - 4 DVDs - 8 hours, DVDs include: ""The Interview Collection"", ""The Awards Collection"", ""The Archive and Documentary Collection"" and ""The Image Collection"". Also includes double sided poster. The Interview Collection has numerous never before seen interviews which reveal why Michael is loved by so many fans, there was only one Michael Jackson that we all came to know through his music and dance, The Awards Collection is packed with far too numerous awards to list fully here, Michael broke many of the previous records through his music and performances which will live on forever, The Archive and Documentary Collection has much rare and intimate footage revealing the lives and times that made Michael Jackson the number one world superstar this collection has it all, The Image Collection photo library, 2,500 images which can be viewed as a slide show or individually, this is a real visual treat to The King of Pop,",1280793600,14,1507,4.726235741444867

4107866,5,B003CHI5E6,"Hi, posting a quick review even though I'm still half way through watching disc 3 here on my computer, DVD 3 has some amazing old and rare film footage that I have never seen before includes private hotel stuff of Jackson 5 and old documentary type material, excellent quality, this disc is essential viewing I assure you! So to go back, DVD 1 is 2 hours of in depth lenghty interviews which I've not seen on any other releases that I have, great quality. DVD 2 is 3 hours of Michael's world awards and did he break some records, some here come with Japanese subtitles, quality was ok to good to great, especially considering a lot of this was quite old. There is a super amount of footage on these 3 discs, 8 hours according to the back of the box. DVD 4 is 2,500 photo images in 4 files plus there's a seperate double sided folded poster of the front image with the reverse being a collage of Michael postcard type images, this all comes in a cardboard outter sleeve, cannot list all thats in this as do not have the time at the mo except to say it really is a fantastic fans collection, very nicely put together and I'm very glad I got this to add to my collection,",1278201600,34,1168,4.2657657657657655

8394208,5,B003CHI5E6,This is the DVD that completes all expectations. I have on video many hours of MJ bits and pieces but this takes the cake as its stuff I was too young to see. This DVD is amazing and exactly what I was hoping for!,1366502400,,213,3.8636363636363638
8394209,3,B003CHI5E6,"This DVD collection is really just okay for a collector who has to have everything or for someone young who wasn't around to see most of Michael's life. But for most fans, much of this has already been shown on TV. The interviews are all mostly post Dangerous.  I would have loved to see something from the Bad or Thriller era. The awards DVD was cool to see him accepting so many awards, but it was all jumbled up and out of chronological order. The documentary DVD was probably the best of the set, but again I've seen most of these on TV.",1365206400,,541,4.252427184466019

It has footage of him out in public, appearances at awards and interviews he done throughout his career.
