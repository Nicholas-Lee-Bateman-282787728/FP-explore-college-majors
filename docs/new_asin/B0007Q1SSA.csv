8050379,5,B0007Q1SSA,"Paris. June 1940. The German troops advance through the city. The population in mass, decide to evacuate their homes. But I beg you to remind (and eventually to watch in case you haven't, the opening sequence of Forbidden  games Rene Clment in which  the first shots constitute a well deserved homage for that Giant film). Odile, is a young widow, who also is in the group of self exiled people. She and her children, Cathy and Philippe join to the exodus. After a realist aerial bombardment, his car is destroyed as well all her ownerships, and she will have to make up her mind the next step to follow. They decide to walk far from the group, and get into the forest where they will meet Ivan, a weird adolescent. Since that moment the rest runs for you in this poignant and slow paced  portrait of loneliness, hopeless, and desperation where the aim of survive is the only breath of life.

The pictorial narrative style of Andre Tehin, one of the most connoted filmmakers of his generation, will allow us to enjoy a pastoral movie, with a fascinating and imperceptible visual rhythm that never decays. An absorbing movie that is availed for the pleasant and enigmatic beauty and well known talent of Emanuelle Beart in the principal role.

Formidable and mesmerizing.",1148342400,,1270,4.728506787330317
