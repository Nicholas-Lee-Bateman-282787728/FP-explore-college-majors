3114619,5,B0013KGWBM,A really good workout.  I really like her approach. She works several muscle group at the same time.,1223769600,2,100,4.555555555555555
3114620,5,B0013KGWBM,"I found this workout to be very effective for the whole body  - not only for arms.  A previous review complained it concentrated mainly on arms, but if you listen closely & follow the instructor you can feel it working not only on your core but in your legs & glut area.  I used very light weights & believe me it was enough. You have an option not to use weights, & it's still effective. I liked the mat exercises. It stressed toning on the abs, legs & glut.  The music was also good, fitting into the whole mood.",1221782400,4,514,4.161616161616162
3114621,5,B0013KGWBM,I have been a fan of Ellen since I began doing Pilates.  And this workout doesn't disappoint.  Like other reviews there is a lot of upper body work but if you really listen to what she is talking about while you do the arm work you focus and use your core as well.  She is soothing and calming through this very flowing workout.  It does use light hand weights but the moves are shown without weights by another lady in the workout.  I really enjoyed this workout and would recommend it to anyone who wants a different twist on Pilates.,1211414400,4,536,4.32
3114622,5,B0013KGWBM,"Yes, you will use a lot of upper body muscles in this workout, but if you listen to Ellen explain what you're doing, and if you really apply your mind, you will realize that the power you need to get through it comes from the core.  That is what is so intelligent about her videos.
Ellen's workouts flow beautifully and are perfectly balanced. No jerky moves or stomping.  I LOVE how she challenges you to think about each move.  You'll really notice the difference if you use your brain!!
I hope this doesn't make it sound too new age-y or spooky.  Ellen Barrett's videos are all fun and lighthearted.  She's like your little sister dying to share her secrets to achieving the perfect bod.  All is forgiven if you just give it your best!  I always feel like a million bucks after doing one of her workout videos.
Bonus: it's a barefoot workout and the music is nice.
Clearly a lot of effort went into making this video series nothing short of excellent.
I recommend all three.  (the Yogini workout is not yet listed on Amazon, but is awesome, too)",1210291200,34,1048,4.478947368421053
3114623,5,B0013KGWBM,"I have several of Ellen Barrett's DVDs and find her workouts challenging. I feel great when I'm done. I do this workout with 3 lb weights, and wouldn't use anything heavier. There is a lot of upper body work, but also plenty of side lunges and glute work, too. The floor exercises are tough, but not impossible - it's probably wise to pace yourself and just do what you can without forcing things. I definitely feel realigned and relaxed when it's all over. This is a good companion to her Yogini workout - now that's one tough routine!! (Amazon doesn't have it yet.)",1209686400,5,567,4.514563106796117
3114624,5,B0013KGWBM,"I liked this workout. I'd agree with the last review that this DVD does have focus on arms and upper body, but I still feel this is a great complete workout. I use this with her Fat Buring Fusion together every other day and feel this is a pretty good combination.",1207008000,19,264,4.196078431372549
3114625,2,B0013KGWBM,"I was a disapointed in this dvd.  The first three sections worked mainly the arms non-stop, and only last section ""matwork"" had any leg work at all.  I felt it was quite an un-even workout.",1206489600,5,189,4.371428571428571
3114626,5,B0013KGWBM,"I am a big fan of Ellen Barrett's, and have been for a couple of years.  My favorite routine of her's, up to now, was the one she created for FitTV's ""All Star Workouts"" called Zen Sculpt.  My next favorite, also from ""All Star Workouts"" was her Slow-robics.  This new DVD, ""Slim Sculpt"" is from Ellen's Buff Girl Fitness productions, and is a melding of both of the ""All Star"" routines!  It is a great workout from start to finish, and is very challenging and tough.  It is Ellen at her very best.

A little note about Ellen's style...she isn't for those who want a bulky physique.  She is more about elongating and strengthening the muscles for a lean and feminine dancer's body.  Her routines blend Plilates and weight/resistant training, with cardio integration.  The entire program works all areas of the body--the powerhouse, the heart center, and the limbs.  So, you burn calories, build muscle, and stretch through each move smoothly and gracefully.  There is a great warm up, followed by the main body of the routine using light hand weights, which has plenty of her signature plies and ""butterfly"" moves and some balance challenges, with mat work (powerhouse and glutes) and a cool down/stretch at the end.

Working out with Ellen is not easy, but it is gentle to the mind/body.  If you want hard-core cardio, with lots of jumping around and kick-boxing, she's not for you.  If you want to look like Cathe Friedrich, Ellen won't get you there.  However, if you want to be toned, flexible, long and lean, she's your gal.  Done on a regular basis, you will see results.

If you want to see what this workout is all about, watch Ellen's ""All Star Workout"" segments, then think of a combination of each routine.  That's what this is, and for me, it's perfect!",1204070400,113,1765,4.675324675324675

3114639,5,B0013KGWBM,"I have been meaning to get this workout, it's one of her older ones and I feel that these are the more challenging ones. This one is great, i found myself needing to put down the weights at one point. This is really a full workout, I love all her workouts and she's a great instructor.",1468972800,,285,4.107142857142857
3114640,5,B0013KGWBM,My daughter gave this to me for my birthday. I love it. I am not very coordinated so it has taken me a few times to learn the moves. I am so happy doing a workout that increases your heart rate and makes you sweat. It also works your muscles. Love the music and her soothing voice and encouraging words as you do the workout. Would highly recommend it to other.,1465257600,,361,4.098591549295775
3114641,5,B0013KGWBM,Fantastic workout! One of Ellen's best.,1465171200,,39,5.666666666666667
3114642,4,B0013KGWBM,"As usual, I love Ellen's style.  The workout is smooth and easy to follow.  My only complaint is the music, which I absolutely can't stand.  It makes me think of music from my childhood, maybe in a nursery, but also (dare I say) could have been lifted from a 1970's adult video...  Yeah, it creeps me out.  Maybe once I learn the moves I can turn off the sound and play something more current.",1464393600,,393,4.256756756756757

3114647,5,B0013KGWBM,Ellen is one of my favorite DVD workout coaches!  I thought this workout would be easy but the cover of the DVD is deceiving. This workout  targets the entire body and using 2 pound weights I am sweating and when the workout is over feeling great!,1450051200,,247,4.3478260869565215

3114652,5,B0013KGWBM,"FANTASTIC, FUN, EFFECTIVE WORKOUT! Ellen's fusion fitness method (cardio, stretch and strength) is an ideal workout plan for me. Ellen is an awesome instructor.",1433894400,,160,5.708333333333333
3114653,5,B0013KGWBM,"i love her dvds..this is fun, and different from the other pilates. its fun..of course you have to do it daily in order to get results...but when i do it...you really sweat, and feel that you worked out your muscles and also, the pain in your body  from doing nothing, goes away , you strech your body and it feels good....",1432425600,,323,4.295081967213115
3114654,4,B0013KGWBM,"This is a nice exercise DVD for a light day.  It's doable but still a challenge for someone new to exercise.  The music is pleasant. The pace is nice, and not frantic or dull.  Ellen is calmly encouraging. A modifier is shown in the background.  It's a full body workout, but the emphasis is on the upper body with light hand weights (1-3 pounds).  The real work is done in the first 30 minutes. The last 15 minutes are floor work and stretching.  I enjoy Ellen's demeanor - she cues well, her voice is pleasant, and she's appropriately encouraging.  Some of Ellen's other DVDs are more challenging, but this one is graceful without being complicated.  As I said, it's good for a light day or someone new to exercise.

What I can't address is effectiveness of the workout.  Yes, your heart rate goes up a bit.  Yes, you're using light weights.  However, this is probably not a shape changing workout unless you're new to exercise and are careful with your calories.

I own many of Ellen's DVDs, and the ones I use most are those with weights.  I'm a fan of her Crunch and SELF DVDs.

Note:  although Ellen and her two students are barefoot, this can be done with shoes without shoes being in the way.",1430870400,,1200,4.460829493087558
3114655,4,B0013KGWBM,I love most of her DVD's workout yet this one is not of Ellen's best presentation. Too slow and boring...,1425340800,,105,4.3
3114656,5,B0013KGWBM,"I'm a huge fan of Ellen Barrett's workouts; this one is very challenging to some muscles in my arms that I don't think I ever reached before. I really love her reinforcement of not just being cosmetically beautiful but also being functionally fit. It ends up being pretty cardiovascular as well as strengthening; I had to swap out for a lighter set of weights because it hits some muscles that are  ""in need of attention"".",1425081600,,422,4.626666666666667

3114670,5,B0013KGWBM,This is a nice workout with light weights. Really hardcore may be disappointed but probably wouldn't go for this one anyway. I like Ellen Barrett and the level of this workout is perfect. Sometimes less is more or less is just right. The ending floor exercises for butt and thighs are great!,1420761600,,291,4.615384615384615
3114671,5,B0013KGWBM,"I like her teaching style.  She is friendly and gives good cues.  The workout is done in bare feet, which I like.  I've been working out with light weights for many years using another method but have recently developed stage IV arthritis in my knee so I had to find a gentler workout.  I can do all the exercises in this video without hurting my knee.  There aren't alot of moves that involve squatting and there are no moves done on the knees.  This in not an intense strength building workout but does tone and stretch the entire body.",1418256000,2,538,4.383838383838384

I am not stressing my neck doing sit ups.  I am rotating this with Sleek Sculpt, and Slim Sculpt.  I love them all!  I am 55 and I did this workout with 2lb weights.  I am also sleeping better since doing exercise DVD's.",1406764800,,394,4.301369863013699
3114674,5,B0013KGWBM,"WOW!  What a fantastic workout!  I used 2 lb. weights for my first use and I did not have a problem!  This workout works every muscle, the abs workout was also terrific.  I cannot do sit-ups to save my life, and this abs workout worked my abs so much better.  I will be rotating this with skinny sculpt and sleek sculpt.  I am 55 and feel like these workouts will give me everything I need.",1406592000,,390,4.133333333333334
3114675,5,B0013KGWBM,"I LOVE this workout!  Harder than it looks at first, but not too hard.  I feel energized when I am done.  This is a 45-minute workout with light weights in your hands most of the time.  I love Ellen Barrett's signature whole-body movements and fusion fitness workouts.",1405641600,,268,4.638297872340425
3114676,5,B0013KGWBM,"I have almost all of Ellen Barrett's exercise DVD's. Though some of them are similar to each other, this one focuses much more on using repetitive movements with light weights, surprisingly harder than one might assume. She works through the body, and you get an excellent workout. Highly recommend!",1404432000,,299,5.122448979591836
3114687,5,B0013KGWBM,Excellent workout. I love Ellen and have many of her DVD's,1404000000,,58,4.363636363636363
3114688,5,B0013KGWBM,"I love Ellen Barrett. I have done and own almost every one of her workouts, including her earlier crunch days, her fit tv appearances, and her self workouts. Out of all of those workouts, this one is my favorite. I find that this is honestly her most difficult video, so if you are looking for an overall challenging workout, this one is for you.

I find each series to be pretty darn difficult and I am begging Ellen to stop! You warm up, go into light weight work (but do not worry, there are lower body workouts as well, the chair segment, wow!), then around the 30 minute mark, you do 15 minutes of matwork. I really enjoy ending my workouts with matwork that complements your standing work. I absolutely adore Ellen's matwork segments and I wish had a DVD of all her little matwork segments combined. Also, if you are short on time and just looking for a 30 minute workout, you could cut out the matwork segment at the end.

I like all of Ellen's workouts, I really do. But I love this one because it challenges me. Even though this workout always challenges me, I feel so amazing after I finish it. I am energized and feel invigorated and amazing! I just love that feeling. Also, I know this workout has made me stronger. I can outlast all my friends with weight work, and I even upped my the poundage of my weights on my other Ellen workouts! I have a rotation of Ellen workouts I do every week, and believe me I see the difference in my body. I love it! In case anyone is wondering my Ellen favorites are: Skinny Sculpt, Bikini Ready Fast (Self), Sleek Sculpt Express (Great for arms), Fat Burning Fusion, Slim Sculpt, and Power Fusion! As you can tell, I am partial to her DVDs that use weights. Thats because I do other cardio throughout the week and want to tone up when doing exercise DVDs.

In conclusion, Ellen Barrett is fantastic. You will love her cueing, her choreography, and her mixture of pilates, yoga, ballet, and traditional aerobics. She is positive and helpful without being overly perky. She is relatable and you will always get a great workout and feel it the next day! Any level of fitness can do her workouts, you can modify the workout by not using weights, and her other workouts have beginner modifications as well. Her workouts are tough and relaxing all at the same time. Sorry about the length, but  I truly believe you cannot go wrong with any of her workouts. But my favorite is this one! Give it a try.",1402185600,3,2441,4.441964285714286
3114689,5,B0013KGWBM,Ellen Barrett works the entire body using light weights.  Women need a workout like this.  It works on toning the entire body but mostly I feel it in my upper body.  Great DVD.,1399248000,,176,4.2727272727272725

I felt more out of shape...her fancy hand and arm movements and happy feet moves do nothing for me. I was never tired after completing her dvd's. I think if someone is a beginner they might find her workouts helpful, I need more intense movements than ""Happy Feet"" and slow arm movements.",1378425600,5,453,4.469879518072289

3114701,5,B0013KGWBM,"I discovered Ellen's DVDs just over two years ago and have become addicted to working out - more so in the past 1.5 years. Ellen has helped transform me from a lazy couch potato who had 1001 excuses to not exercise to someone who looks forward to working out each day (and thanks to Ellen's other DVDs - someone who now has sculpted obliques!!!). I admit I am usually cursing my bad food choices and exercising in general while I am doing any workout, but after finishing Ellen's DVDs I feel accomplished and inspired to do more.

Ellen's cueing is always excellent so you know what you're doing next (unlike some Denise Austin DVDs where you have to be psychic to figure out what her next move is - and are constantly rewinding because you missed the changeover to the next move). And Ellen's voice (and personality) is pleasant and not at all grating. Love her personality and nature.

Slim Sculpt is similar to Skinny Sculpt in that light hand weights are used for the majority of the workout - this is to help sculpt your arms (my #1 obsession). With both DVDs your arms are up in the air with the weights a lot of the time so do not be a hero and use heavy weights (especially when starting out). With Skinny Sculpt I jumped straight in using weights bad idea as I had the upper body strength of a kitten. I went back to no weights, graduating to weights for part of the workout to being able to use the weights the whole way through. I have had Skinny Sculpt for a while now so I could use weights right away with Slim Sculpt. I love that the moves/workout in Slim Sculpt are different to Skinny Sculpt so with those two and Ellen's newer, Sleek Sculpt Express (and my free weight workouts) I can happily focus on my arms obsession without getting bored!

Ellen Barrett's workouts are for those who want to obtain a flexible, sleek, long line feminine physique without getting injured. If you want a cut/muscle bulging body this lovely lady and her workouts are not for you.",1375574400,2,1980,4.449035812672176
3114702,4,B0013KGWBM,"I think I will like this the more I get into it, but I'm not rating it 5 stars because the music at the beginning of this dvd, when Ellen is talking, is too loud & distracting.  It makes it difficult to concentrate on what she's saying, & I don't want to miss anything Ellen says, because she's really good at giving helpful hints & encouragement without taking it too far.  Of this dvd and her Grace and Gusto one, I'd choose Grace and Gusto first, then this one.  I actually have four of her dvd's, and each of them is better than anything else out there, especially if you're in a time of your life when you can't quite do what you were able to do a few years ago.

These are all great: cool music, challenging moves, and a fun, spunky Ellen who is clearly enjoying herself.  By comparison I find the studio workout to have dull, quiet music, far less challenge, and Ellen seems much more business-like.  I don't feel like she was having any fun, like she does in Power Fusion, Grace and Gusto, Sleek Sculpt Express, and Super Fast Body Blast.  Skinny Sculpt in particular felt like work and I kept watching the clock.  I did sweat a little but I kept watching the clock.  I don't think I will keep this one.",1370304000,2,618,4.464285714285714

3114718,4,B0013KGWBM,"I recently decided to purchase new workout DVDs to add to my collection. I saw all of the rave reviews of Ellen Barret's DVDs so I purchased her entire series before auditing them one at a time. I thought because so many people love her DVDs I would too. I actually do like her DVDs, but I'm in the minority here because I don't feel they are challenging enough. I feel that this workout is great for someone older or starting a new fitness routine. However, for someone who is already in good shape they may find these a little too easy, repetitive, and may just want to use them on a rest day or easy day. If you are trying to lose weight you will definitely have to supplement these workouts with something else.",1365033600,3,715,4.303703703703704
3114719,3,B0013KGWBM,"I own many of Ellen Barrett's DVDs and use them frequently. Her fusion style, presence, and excellent cueing make her one of my favorite video instructors. These are the reasons why Slim Sculpt is somewhat of a disappointment to me.

After a refreshing five-minute warmup, the next fifteen minutes go steadily downhill. The standing Pilates and ballet-style moves with hand weights, when considered individually, are fine and work compound muscle groups. Unfortunately, Ellen plugs on with too many fast repetitions of full arm circles that strain the neck and shoulder socket.

After doing this workout the first time I became sick of ""tracing the sun"", butterflies, and squat circles umpteen times. My 3-pound weights were too heavy for this, yet 3-to-5 pounds are just fine for me on many other similar workouts. Since then, I do my own thing (bicep curls, pectoral flys, etc.) while the ladies on the TV press on with their circles. There is more to upper body work than doing circles!

This DVD does have some redeeming qualities, like the wisp, one-legged squat with pullers, and the ending matwork. Nevertheless, I would not recommend this title if you're shopping for an Ellen DVD. Fat Burning Fusion, Grace & Gusto, Crunch series, and her Blood Type B workouts all represent better versions of the Ellen Barrett repertoire.",1364169600,3,1332,5.045454545454546

3114748,5,B0013KGWBM,"This is the third workout I've tried from Ellen Barrett's Studio series.  I first picked up&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fusion-Flow/dp/B0031SD4G0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fusion Flow</a>&nbsp;and really enjoyed it, so then I moved on to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Slim-Sculpt/dp/B0013KGWBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Slim Sculpt</a>, which uses light weights.  I found that workout to be just okay, but I thought I might prefer SKINNY SCULPT, another one of Ellen's workouts which offers the option of using very light dumbbells.

Ellen works out here in the same large, open studio used for FUSION FLOW; she instructs live, providing very good mirrored cuing.  She is joined by Natalie and Michelle, with Michelle modifying the moves by using no weights.  The Main Menu offers options for ""Play All"" or ""Chapter Selection.""  I have provided detailed breakdowns for each of the chapters (including approximate times) below.

Warm-Up, 4.5 minutes
After a few deep breaths with plies, Ellen begins the warm-up with side overhead reaches and side punches, moving these into a combination.  She adds a large Figure 8 move which stretches the entire shoulder girdle before repeating the sequence on the other side.  This section had a nice flow and felt very good!

Series One with Weights, 9.5 Minutes
Here Ellen starts by repeating the same combination of side reach, side punch, and then Figure 8s, this time holding the weights.  In between most of the movements, she performs ""breathing arms,"" which involves simply lifting the arms up over the head with the weights, palms up, and then moving the arms back down, palms down.  She moves into ""star arms,"" spreading the arms on a diagonal while performing a moving plie from side-to-side.  This is followed by an arm squeeze back to the rear, adding in a plie mambo to the side.

Series Two with Weights, 14 minutes
Ellen begins this series with a warrior lunge to the side, adding in a biceps curl.  From here she goes on to a pulsing chair move.  Coming back to standing, she performs shoulder presses both up and forward and then adds in side leg lifts.  After repeating this sequence on the second side, Ellen finishes this section with some work in a wide legged forward bend position, including heel lifts and rear delt arm raises with a twist.

Abs with Weights, 2.5 minutes
This short series is performed in a slightly leaning seated position (""bucket seat"").  Still using the weights, the moves include pull backs with both bent and straight arms as well as a rowing exercise.

Dancer Mat Work, 9.5 minutes
Ellen starts the mat work lying on the back for some bridges, adding pulses to these.  Next comes heel beats:  Ellen performs a total of 3 sets, alternating wide-legged straddle moves in-between.  This is followed by a set of knee drops to each side, adding in a kick.  The final move in this section is a wiper leg drop to further work the inner thighs.

Finishing Series, 5 minutes
For the stretching, Ellen begins seated in a side-saddle position for a thigh stretch; she performs a seated forward bend with knee pumps between sides.  She concludes the workout with additional seated stretches for the shoulders and neck.

I definitely enjoyed this workout more than Slim Sculpt, as the arms work felt more balanced and there seemed to be more targeted leg moves overall, particularly in the floor work.  I used 3 lb. weights, and I definitely would not go any heavier than this; in fact, I had to put the weights down for most of the ""breathing arms"" repetitions.

Overall, I think that SKINNY SCULPT is a very nice 45-minute workout that offers a bit of everything (i.e., light toning, a bit of cardio, and plenty of stretching) and is likely to appeal to a wide audience; I would definitely recommend it!",1344556800,4,3872,5.140575079872204
3114749,5,B0013KGWBM,"I like Skinny Sculpt a lot as it gives a great workout and results. This would probably be good for those anywhere from beginner to intermediate levels.

Although I am fairly uncoordinated and at a beginner level (somewhere between couch potato & light exerciser), I was able to learn/do the moves within a few workouts and complete it. You really do get what you put into the workout. Number 1 tip is to always control your movements to see results. Of course, using weights will yield even better results! However, I have not used weights yet.

I have being using Skinny Sculpt 4-5 days a week for 30 days. I changed my diet to eliminate as much as possible processed foods, sugar, salt, reduced fat intake and increased my water intake. I have also added lots of salads, veggies and fresh fruits.  However, I am still eating about 1,800 calories a day. This is why I have only lost 2.2 lbs in 30 days.  However, I have lost a combined total of 6 inches (in): 0.5 in (chest), 1.5 in (waist), 1.25 in (hips), 1.25 in (arms) and 1.5 in (legs). In addition to the weight loss and lost inches, I have also noticed an increase in energy and flexibility as well as better posture.

I am delighted with my results as my top goals were (and are) to increase my activity level and tone up. I am certain I would have lost more weight *if* I had reduced my daily caloric intake.

3114750,4,B0013KGWBM,"This is the second workout that I have tried in Ellen Barrett's studio series.  Although I didn't click very well with some of her older workouts (e.g., Crunch Pick Your Spot Pilates), I recently tried and loved her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fusion-Flow/dp/B0031SD4G0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fusion Flow</a>, so I thought I would look into to some of her other newer DVDs.

As with all of her studio workouts, Ellen performs this routine barefoot in a large, open studio.  She has two background exercisers, Debra and Meg, who modifies the exercises to be performed without weights.  The only equipment used is a mat and LIGHT weights (at most 3#, but even that felt heavy to me for many of the movements).  The Main Menu offers options for Play All, Chapter Selection, and Greetings from the Studio!

Although this workout is well-chaptered, the chapters flow into each other rather than have defined start/end points.  However, I will use the names which appear on the chapter menu to describe each segment in greater detail below (all times are approximate).

Warm-Up (5 minutes)
Ellen begins with gentle breaths in and out, arm circles, and plies; she concludes the warm-up with an inner thigh stretch.

Side Leg Lift Series (5.5 minutes)
Ellen picks up the weights for this segment and begins with a side arm lift, palms up/palms down.  She transitions into side-to-side leg lifts, continuing with arm movements.  This move ends with a squat circle.  She also performs ""butterfly arms"" (wide, circling arms) while doing plies from side-to-side.  She repeats the whole series, this time lifting the leg to the rear.

Plie Stance Series (9.5 minutes)
Ellen continues to use the weights for even more arms work in this section.  Standing in a Pilates stance, she performs moves including side reaches, shoulder presses, big circles with plies, triceps overhead presses, sun arms, Pilates arm circles, Pilates chest expander, and additional butterfly arms.  The legs get just a bit of work with a set of static lunges to either side.

Pulley Arms Lunge (9.5 minutes)
The name of this segment describes the first move:  a single leg lunge with a one-arm ""pulley"" move to the rear.  Additional moves include whisps around the body, back extensions with lasso arms, single and double arm rows, and again, just a bit of legs work with skater squats.

Mat Work (10.5 minutes)
Ellen begins here with a twisting move from a reclined seated position.  She then comes to lying for some Pilates-inspired matwork, including single leg stretch, ballerina criss-cross, partial to full rollup, and knee drops (progressively adding increased challenge).

Final Stretch (5 minutes)
Ellen starts the stretch in cobbler's pose for a rocking butterfly move; she also performs some hip lifts.  Additional stretches include a seated twist, cross-legged forward bend, and brief neck/shoulder stretches to finish.

Overall, I enjoyed this workout.  It definitely had more of an upper body emphasis, although I was aware of that going in.  However, I found it a bit difficult to find the right amount of weight to use consistently throughout the workout.  I started off with 3#, but this quickly felt too heavy.  I switched to 2#, which was better, but I found that I liked doing some movements, such as the butterfly arms, much better without the weights.  So, the second time I did the workout, I tried it WITHOUT the weights for most of the exercises (I still used weights for the tricep work and rows), and I found this to be much more to my liking, as I got better range of motion from the movements.

I am glad I discovered Ellen's studio series and would definitely recommend these DVDs.",1341273600,2,3723,5.095709570957096

I have been working out almost every day faithfully for the last couple of months and have been doing more grueling videos such as the Kettlebells series, the ""90 day shred"" series and Jillian Michaels.  When I went to do this, I figured I was ""taking it easy"" for the day.  Even though she said no more than 3 pounds, I figured since I was using weights almost daily I could use my 6 pounders.  Well it was pretty tough with my 6 pound weights and I couldn't do the whole thing with that high of weights.  As others have mentioned, she is very likeable and not annoying and the time goes by pretty fast.  Some videos I am looking at the time, hoping it will end and didn't feel that way with this one.  I also agree that it isn't as grueling as a lot of the other videos out there so I stil consider it one of my ""easier"" videos but it was still good and I would recommend.",1326758400,2,897,4.091428571428572

This workout is completely low impact (yay!). There is no jumping, extreme flexing/lunging, etc. I used 2lb hand weights and my arms were ON FIRE. I was dripping sweat within 20 minutes of this workout. What I like about this workout is the principle of not building bulk, only getting lean and long. That is just what I need. I am glad I found Ellen Barrett and her style of working out. I will alternate her with Leslie Sansone and my usual long walks around the block. The one thing I would caution is if someone has terrible knees not to try it. There are lots of squats and the movements involve the knees and surrounding muscles quite a bit.

It is great though for getting the shoulders to drop down and release tension in the neck and shoulders, and really helps to stretch out the sides, which is an area that many workouts don't touch on very effectively. While there isn't a huge focus on the legs, the legs still do get plenty of workout since many of the exercises require movement of the whole body from side to side, or bending of the knees. There is also enough movement to get a gentle to moderate cardio workout, which for many people is more than enough. I find it a great complement to my martial arts training since it helps to sort out the tightening of muscles in the shoulders, upper back and chest, however it does get a bit tough if I have had a heavy workout with my arms in a previous day.",1300233600,4,944,4.25

You won't find serious cardio here, but my heart rate was elevated and I worked up a slight sweat.

- Are returning to exercise, just trying to stay healthy rather than run marathons, or trying to squeeze exercise into a full schedule
- Are interested in protecting your back, knees or feet from stress (I have terrible feet - can do this barefoot)

Like all her workouts, you're moving all the time, using multiple muscle groups and keeping your heart rate elevated.  It isn't the most intense workout you'll ever do, but it's fun, gentle, and if you're not an exercise junkie, you'll still want to do the workout all the time.

Ellen is a great instructor with an excellent voice.  She cues well, and is encouraging and upbeat without ever acting hyper.  She constructs great routines that are doable but never boring. My athletic history is swimming and distance cycling, and workouts with really complex choreography are discouraging.

I have the older version, Slim Sculpt, and I noticed in this version, she clarifies a few times that this workout uses all muscle groups, etc., probably based on feedback from the older version (Slim S.)
So - I thought I'd include this video during my ""light"" rotation days, and boy, was I wrong. It is arm-heavy, but my legs ached too - there's a lot of legwork in this one. A lot of abs, too.
Overall, it's great to add in as a weight training workout. I've used many ""sculpt"" videos, but both Ellen's Sculpt ones are my favorites.
Plus, people notice I've ""lost"" weight, even if I haven't, simply because her videos give me that lean look.

Well, for this new DVD, I had to immediately switch to 3 lbs. Just by using light weights, Ellen is able to engage many, many muscles simultaneously. She even says at one point, ""In real-life, we use more than one muscle at a time."" Don't expect to develop big muscles with this workout, but you will feel long, lines of muscles burning all at once.

The workout begins with a quick warm-up, followed by the majority of the workout with weights. Finally, before cool-down, you do a lot of mat work to shape and tone your core, legs and butt.

I love that you can do this barefoot. If I do a day or two of high impact or heavy cardio in a row, this is a nice treat for my body. I still sweat, my heart is pumping, and I still feel like I did not take a day off. Your body gets a challenging workout from Skinny Sculpt!",1277596800,11,979,4.147368421052631

I have a nerve injury on my foot right now that is keeping me from the gym so I wanted to find something that was low impact, required no shoes, and would still give me a workout.  Well, this tape does all of that!  I had to start the arm work with no weights and slowly have moved up to 3 pound weights and sometimes I end up putting them down to take a break.  The whole time I was doing the tape I was thinking about how sore my arms and shoulders would be the next day so when I woke up the next morning and found my legs and glutes were sore, I was surprised.  This is a very complete workout that doesn't miss a muscle of the body although I did find the ab work to be a bit short and not quite as challenging.  The reason I gave it 4 stars was because the music was a bit annoying and there is a bit of repetition to her moves that can also bore you.  So, for that reason, I do this video about 2 times a week and alternate with Jillian Michaels Yoga DVD's or with Core Fusion DVD's.  I can't wait for my foot to heal so I can get back on the cardio work but for now, these tapes will do!",1277424000,9,1183,3.8595041322314048

3114813,5,B0013KGWBM,"This is my 3rd dvd from Ellen and that tells you I like her as an instructor. I alternate Slim Sculpt with Tracy Anderson's Mat workout when I want variety in my toning days. I also use Jari Love, Voight, Tamilee, etc. when I want to lift heavier than 3 lbs. to strengthen my bones and avoid osteoporosis. But for reshaping/sculpting my body, it's either Ellen or Tracy. I have a long way to go transforming my body to a lean non-bulky look but who says I'm in a race for that....My rotation consists of 4 cardio days-3 Strength/Toning days and I add a 'Power' Stretch routine to 1 cardio day. At 45 years old, I just have to keep at it-meaning exercise daily and eat sensibly [the hardest part for me]. Consistency in exercising got me to avoiding hypertension and diabetes maintenance meds. Back to Slim Sculpt, Ellen's moves may be repetitive but I personally don't mind. There's more upper body work here particularly the shoulders and arms 'cuz you'll feel it the next day and the floorwork emphasized on the core and butt muscles. The thighs were worked a bit during the standing routine so it's a good total body workout. Ellen's routine is very gentle to the body but you will sweat!

I find it quite challenging, at times, since you're constantly using your arms while lifting 3-lb weights. I have shoulder problems and so I'm mindful of this, and use 2-lb weights instead, and when my shoulders begin to feel the burn, I alternate between using the weights and exercising sans weights (Ellen has 2 others demonstrating the exercises, and one of them does not use weights as a modification). I find that I get a good workout, and feel really good at the end of it.

I have several fitness DVD's (Denise Austin, Kathy Smith, Suzanne Bowen, Lara Hudson, Leslie Sansone, and Chris Freytag among others) and this is a workout that I think I will use alongside my Denise Austin workouts.

The 2 shortcomings of this DVD: 1) The background music sounds weird and I would have preferred hearing something else instead! 2) I would have liked to have had the option of mixing and matching the different segments of the workout so that if I didn't feel like doing the whole 45 minutes at a stretch I could have chosen not to do so (this option is available on Denise Austin's DVD's).",1275177600,10,1170,4.5933014354066986

I never write online reviews but here I go.  There are so many fabulous aspects to this DVD that I will just say: buy it (it's cheap) and do it every day.  You will be strong, not sweat much and enjoy your workout. It's 45 minutes of attention to every muscle group, and it really does build long, firm muscle without bulk.

Ellen's cuing is extraordinary, even for a person like me who can hardly follow in an aerobics class.  Plus I have no idea how she talks and explains and encourages and keeps her breath, wow. Yes, she's a bit Valley Girl perky sometimes but I have learned to like it.

A couple small issues: On the lunge portion, Ellen explains the process so much on the right leg that she ends up doing many more lunges there than on the left.  So I change legs every day to accommodate that and to keep the workout even.

Absolutely wonderful, the only workout DVD you need....just do it, every day.",1273104000,44,1171,4.339449541284404

I have been doing a rotation of Ellen's videos every week for a year with this being my most recent one, so I am definitely no beginner, and I had to pause a few times throughout the first few times I did it. I thought my arms were going to fall off. The mat workout at the end is great too, with different moves she hadn't done before. I am definitely feeling my inner thighs after Skinny Sculpt.

It effectively works your arms (especially your shoulders) while elevating your heart rate and leaving you feeling great afterward. My only complaint (and the reason I'd give this workout four stars instead of five) is that for Ellen junkies who've been faithfully doing her Studio workouts, it would be nice if they increased in difficulty, or if she released some workouts for more advanced exercisers. This workout is lovely, but it didn't seem any more rigorous than her earlier ""Slim Sculpt"" release, and her other two latest releases also seemed on par or even easier than the earlier ones.

I remain a big fan of Ellen's and especially like her studio series (PS: I like the new carpet in the studio too - looks great).  My only minor complaint is that during the second half of the dvd, the music seems to get louder and I struggle to hear Ellen's instruction so I turn up the volume but then the music is even louder and so on.

I don't need any added bulk and I like using lighter weights to workout with instead of heavy weight at my age (early 50's), heavy weights hurt my joints.  With this workout I feel long, lean and strong.",1265500800,7,339,4.508196721311475

Ellen Barrett is a great instructor and has given me a leaner physic I wanted to achieve. The moves are simple and the pace is perfect (not too intensive that you might want to quit, but you will not get bored and turn it off). The best part about using Ellen's workouts, you might not feel sore after the workout... but the next morning you will!!! Her videos are perfect if you want to add a little something extra to your workout routine.

3114856,3,B0013KGWBM,"I love most everything about this DVD but it does have an emphasis on upper body work with many reps of arm raises above the shoulder and over the head. If you have had any kind of shoulder injury I would approach cautiously.  I have strong shoulders as a competitive swimmer but I found that even without weights this workout nags at an old shoulder injury.  This isn't a workout I can do very frequently because of that.  I love the music and the ballet and pilates moves so I will try from time to time.  It will be an occasional change of pace, not a standard for me.",1254787200,11,571,4.2110091743119265
3114857,5,B0013KGWBM,"I swim most days & when I don't I have used this fitness dvd on non swimming days. Swimming gives a very good workout but,  when I've done this dvd I find my muscles a little sore the next day. So  it seems this workout is targeting different muscles. I find the workout to be easy to do even for the first time. Ellen is good in her instructions & the workout is not a real fast pace one. Perhaps this is why the workout is effective, slowing down makes it harder for the muscles because you don't use momentum. I find my heart rate in my target zone when doing this workout. I have seen Ellen Barrett on Fit TV & like her Slow Aerobics, so I figured I'd give this one a try. I was not disappointed! This workout combines weights (1lb.or what you can handle), yoga and dance & is not difficult at all to do.  I would recommend this dvd if your looking to sculpt your muscles.",1252108800,,876,4.111111111111111

In just a short time, I feel more flexible, I am able to stand and sit straighter (I have fairly-significant curvature of the spine) and my hip pain from the malalignment is greatly reduced to almost non-existent at times.  I can only imagine the benefits this program would have for those with ""normal"" spines.  Ellen is so pleasant.  She is like having your most non-judgemental best friend right in your living room, encouraging you to be the best you can be.  Her stated goal is to inspire and she certainly does in my opinion.",1251763200,7,692,4.5772357723577235
3114859,5,B0013KGWBM,"I have all three Studio workouts and adore them. For me, SS is the hardest of the three due to the upper body work with weights (I only had two pound weights but will try it with one pounders). This has Ellen's signature moves: skater, second position plies, lunges, butterfly and some very unique and nice stretches at the end. I am a workout junkie, low intermediate, and highly recommend The Studio series. I am alternating all three with great results.",1244505600,,456,4.6419753086419755

I'd absolutely recommend this for an ""off"" day.  Besides the light workout, Ellen always has an upbeat attitude and makes you really want to do your best.
I guess I'm just bias to her Crunch days.",1240876800,6,467,4.213483146067416

3114864,5,B0013KGWBM,"This workout uses light weights (3 lbs) to tone the arms and shoulders, without building bulky muscles. I was amazed at how challenging 3 lb weights can be (I usually use 5 or 8 lbs with Kathy Smith). I can barely make it through all the exercises with the 3 lb weights and feel sore and great the next day. It's true, there's not much lower body emphasis, so I don't think this workout would be great on its own, but combined with Ellen's Yogini and Fat Burning Fusion DVDs with both focus more on the lower body, it's perfect. Slim Sculpt also contains some great standing core work, and works well with Ellen's Fat Burning Pilates or Self workouts, which I also love. I actually look forward to working out with this set, and that's saying a lot for me!!",1236124800,3,757,4.375886524822695

If you need strength training, stretch, flexibility, and cardio all rolled into one, look no further! Ellen's programs aim to create that long, lean, and yet strong female physique without building bulk.  This one is no exception.  I use a pair of 3-lb weights and feel great each time I'm done with this workout. It not only works your upper body, but also your core, glutes and legs.  I consider myself intermediate in terms of fitness level and this routine is perfect for me.  I own dozens of workout dvd's and Ellen's are my favorites.  Bar none.",1224201600,4,661,4.79646017699115

3349117,5,B0013KGWBM,"I found this workout to be very effective for the whole body  - not only for arms.  A previous review complained it concentrated mainly on arms, but if you listen closely & follow the instructor you can feel it working not only on your core but in your legs & glut area.  I used very light weights & believe me it was enough. You have an option not to use weights, & it's still effective. I liked the mat exercises. It stressed toning on the abs, legs & glut.  The music was also good, fitting into the whole mood.",1221782400,4,514,4.161616161616162
3349118,5,B0013KGWBM,I have been a fan of Ellen since I began doing Pilates.  And this workout doesn't disappoint.  Like other reviews there is a lot of upper body work but if you really listen to what she is talking about while you do the arm work you focus and use your core as well.  She is soothing and calming through this very flowing workout.  It does use light hand weights but the moves are shown without weights by another lady in the workout.  I really enjoyed this workout and would recommend it to anyone who wants a different twist on Pilates.,1211414400,4,536,4.32
3349119,5,B0013KGWBM,"Yes, you will use a lot of upper body muscles in this workout, but if you listen to Ellen explain what you're doing, and if you really apply your mind, you will realize that the power you need to get through it comes from the core.  That is what is so intelligent about her videos.
Ellen's workouts flow beautifully and are perfectly balanced. No jerky moves or stomping.  I LOVE how she challenges you to think about each move.  You'll really notice the difference if you use your brain!!
I hope this doesn't make it sound too new age-y or spooky.  Ellen Barrett's videos are all fun and lighthearted.  She's like your little sister dying to share her secrets to achieving the perfect bod.  All is forgiven if you just give it your best!  I always feel like a million bucks after doing one of her workout videos.
Bonus: it's a barefoot workout and the music is nice.
Clearly a lot of effort went into making this video series nothing short of excellent.
I recommend all three.  (the Yogini workout is not yet listed on Amazon, but is awesome, too)",1210291200,34,1048,4.478947368421053

There is a lot of upper body work, but also plenty of side lunges and glute work, too. The floor exercises are tough, but not impossible - it's probably wise to pace yourself and just do what you can without forcing things. I definitely feel realigned and relaxed when it's all over. This is a good companion to her Yogini workout - now that's one tough routine!! (Amazon doesn't have it yet.)",1209686400,5,567,4.514563106796117
3349121,5,B0013KGWBM,"I liked this workout. I'd agree with the last review that this DVD does have focus on arms and upper body, but I still feel this is a great complete workout.

3349122,2,B0013KGWBM,"I was a disapointed in this dvd.  The first three sections worked mainly the arms non-stop, and only last section ""matwork"" had any leg work at all.  I felt it was quite an un-even workout.",1206489600,5,189,4.371428571428571
3349123,5,B0013KGWBM,"I am a big fan of Ellen Barrett's, and have been for a couple of years.  My favorite routine of her's, up to now, was the one she created for FitTV's ""All Star Workouts"" called Zen Sculpt.  My next favorite, also from ""All Star Workouts"" was her Slow-robics.  This new DVD, ""Slim Sculpt"" is from Ellen's Buff Girl Fitness productions, and is a melding of both of the ""All Star"" routines!  It is a great workout from start to finish, and is very challenging and tough.  It is Ellen at her very best.

A little note about Ellen's style...she isn't for those who want a bulky physique.  She is more about elongating and strengthening the muscles for a lean and feminine dancer's body.  Her routines blend Plilates and weight/resistant training, with cardio integration.  The entire program works all areas of the body--the powerhouse, the heart center, and the limbs.  So, you burn calories, build muscle, and stretch through each move smoothly and gracefully.  There is a great warm up, followed by the main body of the routine using light hand weights, which has plenty of her signature plies and ""butterfly"" moves and some balance challenges, with mat work (powerhouse and glutes) and a cool down/stretch at the end.

Working out with Ellen is not easy, but it is gentle to the mind/body.  If you want hard-core cardio, with lots of jumping around and kick-boxing, she's not for you.  If you want to look like Cathe Friedrich, Ellen won't get you there.  However, if you want to be toned, flexible, long and lean, she's your gal.  Done on a regular basis, you will see results.

If you want to see what this workout is all about, watch Ellen's ""All Star Workout"" segments, then think of a combination of each routine.  That's what this is, and for me, it's perfect!",1204070400,113,1765,4.675324675324675

It makes me think of music from my childhood, maybe in a nursery, but also (dare I say) could have been lifted from a 1970's adult video...  Yeah, it creeps me out.

3349151,4,B0013KGWBM,"This is a nice exercise DVD for a light day.  It's doable but still a challenge for someone new to exercise.  The music is pleasant. The pace is nice, and not frantic or dull.  Ellen is calmly encouraging. A modifier is shown in the background.  It's a full body workout, but the emphasis is on the upper body with light hand weights (1-3 pounds).  The real work is done in the first 30 minutes. The last 15 minutes are floor work and stretching.  I enjoy Ellen's demeanor - she cues well, her voice is pleasant, and she's appropriately encouraging.  Some of Ellen's other DVDs are more challenging, but this one is graceful without being complicated.  As I said, it's good for a light day or someone new to exercise.

What I can't address is effectiveness of the workout.  Yes, your heart rate goes up a bit.  Yes, you're using light weights.  However, this is probably not a shape changing workout unless you're new to exercise and are careful with your calories.

I own many of Ellen's DVDs, and the ones I use most are those with weights.  I'm a fan of her Crunch and SELF DVDs.

I can do all the exercises in this video without hurting my knee.  There aren't alot of moves that involve squatting and there are no moves done on the knees.

3349185,5,B0013KGWBM,"I love Ellen Barrett. I have done and own almost every one of her workouts, including her earlier crunch days, her fit tv appearances, and her self workouts. Out of all of those workouts, this one is my favorite. I find that this is honestly her most difficult video, so if you are looking for an overall challenging workout, this one is for you.

I find each series to be pretty darn difficult and I am begging Ellen to stop! You warm up, go into light weight work (but do not worry, there are lower body workouts as well, the chair segment, wow!), then around the 30 minute mark, you do 15 minutes of matwork. I really enjoy ending my workouts with matwork that complements your standing work. I absolutely adore Ellen's matwork segments and I wish had a DVD of all her little matwork segments combined. Also, if you are short on time and just looking for a 30 minute workout, you could cut out the matwork segment at the end.

I like all of Ellen's workouts, I really do. But I love this one because it challenges me. Even though this workout always challenges me, I feel so amazing after I finish it. I am energized and feel invigorated and amazing! I just love that feeling. Also, I know this workout has made me stronger. I can outlast all my friends with weight work, and I even upped my the poundage of my weights on my other Ellen workouts! I have a rotation of Ellen workouts I do every week, and believe me I see the difference in my body. I love it! In case anyone is wondering my Ellen favorites are: Skinny Sculpt, Bikini Ready Fast (Self), Sleek Sculpt Express (Great for arms), Fat Burning Fusion, Slim Sculpt, and Power Fusion! As you can tell, I am partial to her DVDs that use weights. Thats because I do other cardio throughout the week and want to tone up when doing exercise DVDs.

In conclusion, Ellen Barrett is fantastic. You will love her cueing, her choreography, and her mixture of pilates, yoga, ballet, and traditional aerobics. She is positive and helpful without being overly perky. She is relatable and you will always get a great workout and feel it the next day! Any level of fitness can do her workouts, you can modify the workout by not using weights, and her other workouts have beginner modifications as well. Her workouts are tough and relaxing all at the same time. Sorry about the length, but  I truly believe you cannot go wrong with any of her workouts. But my favorite is this one!

3349198,5,B0013KGWBM,"I discovered Ellen's DVDs just over two years ago and have become addicted to working out - more so in the past 1.5 years. Ellen has helped transform me from a lazy couch potato who had 1001 excuses to not exercise to someone who looks forward to working out each day (and thanks to Ellen's other DVDs - someone who now has sculpted obliques!!!). I admit I am usually cursing my bad food choices and exercising in general while I am doing any workout, but after finishing Ellen's DVDs I feel accomplished and inspired to do more.

Ellen's cueing is always excellent so you know what you're doing next (unlike some Denise Austin DVDs where you have to be psychic to figure out what her next move is - and are constantly rewinding because you missed the changeover to the next move). And Ellen's voice (and personality) is pleasant and not at all grating. Love her personality and nature.

Slim Sculpt is similar to Skinny Sculpt in that light hand weights are used for the majority of the workout - this is to help sculpt your arms (my #1 obsession). With both DVDs your arms are up in the air with the weights a lot of the time so do not be a hero and use heavy weights (especially when starting out). With Skinny Sculpt I jumped straight in using weights bad idea as I had the upper body strength of a kitten. I went back to no weights, graduating to weights for part of the workout to being able to use the weights the whole way through. I have had Skinny Sculpt for a while now so I could use weights right away with Slim Sculpt. I love that the moves/workout in Slim Sculpt are different to Skinny Sculpt so with those two and Ellen's newer, Sleek Sculpt Express (and my free weight workouts) I can happily focus on my arms obsession without getting bored!

Ellen Barrett's workouts are for those who want to obtain a flexible, sleek, long line feminine physique without getting injured. If you want a cut/muscle bulging body this lovely lady and her workouts are not for you.",1375574400,2,1980,4.449035812672176

It makes it difficult to concentrate on what she's saying, & I don't want to miss anything Ellen says, because she's really good at giving helpful hints & encouragement without taking it too far.  Of this dvd and her Grace and Gusto one, I'd choose Grace and Gusto first, then this one.  I actually have four of her dvd's, and each of them is better than anything else out there, especially if you're in a time of your life when you can't quite do what you were able to do a few years ago.

I don't feel like she was having any fun, like she does in Power Fusion, Grace and Gusto, Sleek Sculpt Express, and Super Fast Body Blast.

I saw all of the rave reviews of Ellen Barret's DVDs so I purchased her entire series before auditing them one at a time. I thought because so many people love her DVDs I would too. I actually do like her DVDs, but I'm in the minority here because I don't feel they are challenging enough. I feel that this workout is great for someone older or starting a new fitness routine. However, for someone who is already in good shape they may find these a little too easy, repetitive, and may just want to use them on a rest day or easy day. If you are trying to lose weight you will definitely have to supplement these workouts with something else.",1365033600,3,715,4.303703703703704
3349216,3,B0013KGWBM,"I own many of Ellen Barrett's DVDs and use them frequently. Her fusion style, presence, and excellent cueing make her one of my favorite video instructors. These are the reasons why Slim Sculpt is somewhat of a disappointment to me.

After a refreshing five-minute warmup, the next fifteen minutes go steadily downhill. The standing Pilates and ballet-style moves with hand weights, when considered individually, are fine and work compound muscle groups. Unfortunately, Ellen plugs on with too many fast repetitions of full arm circles that strain the neck and shoulder socket.

After doing this workout the first time I became sick of ""tracing the sun"", butterflies, and squat circles umpteen times. My 3-pound weights were too heavy for this, yet 3-to-5 pounds are just fine for me on many other similar workouts. Since then, I do my own thing (bicep curls, pectoral flys, etc.) while the ladies on the TV press on with their circles. There is more to upper body work than doing circles!

This DVD does have some redeeming qualities, like the wisp, one-legged squat with pullers, and the ending matwork. Nevertheless, I would not recommend this title if you're shopping for an Ellen DVD.

3349245,5,B0013KGWBM,"This is the third workout I've tried from Ellen Barrett's Studio series.  I first picked up&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fusion-Flow/dp/B0031SD4G0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fusion Flow</a>&nbsp;and really enjoyed it, so then I moved on to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Slim-Sculpt/dp/B0013KGWBM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Slim Sculpt</a>, which uses light weights.  I found that workout to be just okay, but I thought I might prefer SKINNY SCULPT, another one of Ellen's workouts which offers the option of using very light dumbbells.

Ellen works out here in the same large, open studio used for FUSION FLOW; she instructs live, providing very good mirrored cuing.  She is joined by Natalie and Michelle, with Michelle modifying the moves by using no weights.  The Main Menu offers options for ""Play All"" or ""Chapter Selection.""  I have provided detailed breakdowns for each of the chapters (including approximate times) below.

Warm-Up, 4.5 minutes
After a few deep breaths with plies, Ellen begins the warm-up with side overhead reaches and side punches, moving these into a combination.  She adds a large Figure 8 move which stretches the entire shoulder girdle before repeating the sequence on the other side.  This section had a nice flow and felt very good!

Series One with Weights, 9.5 Minutes
Here Ellen starts by repeating the same combination of side reach, side punch, and then Figure 8s, this time holding the weights.  In between most of the movements, she performs ""breathing arms,"" which involves simply lifting the arms up over the head with the weights, palms up, and then moving the arms back down, palms down.  She moves into ""star arms,"" spreading the arms on a diagonal while performing a moving plie from side-to-side.  This is followed by an arm squeeze back to the rear, adding in a plie mambo to the side.

Series Two with Weights, 14 minutes
Ellen begins this series with a warrior lunge to the side, adding in a biceps curl.  From here she goes on to a pulsing chair move.  Coming back to standing, she performs shoulder presses both up and forward and then adds in side leg lifts.  After repeating this sequence on the second side, Ellen finishes this section with some work in a wide legged forward bend position, including heel lifts and rear delt arm raises with a twist.

Abs with Weights, 2.5 minutes
This short series is performed in a slightly leaning seated position (""bucket seat"").  Still using the weights, the moves include pull backs with both bent and straight arms as well as a rowing exercise.

Dancer Mat Work, 9.5 minutes
Ellen starts the mat work lying on the back for some bridges, adding pulses to these.  Next comes heel beats:  Ellen performs a total of 3 sets, alternating wide-legged straddle moves in-between.  This is followed by a set of knee drops to each side, adding in a kick.  The final move in this section is a wiper leg drop to further work the inner thighs.

Finishing Series, 5 minutes
For the stretching, Ellen begins seated in a side-saddle position for a thigh stretch; she performs a seated forward bend with knee pumps between sides.  She concludes the workout with additional seated stretches for the shoulders and neck.

I definitely enjoyed this workout more than Slim Sculpt, as the arms work felt more balanced and there seemed to be more targeted leg moves overall, particularly in the floor work.  I used 3 lb. weights, and I definitely would not go any heavier than this; in fact, I had to put the weights down for most of the ""breathing arms"" repetitions.

Overall, I think that SKINNY SCULPT is a very nice 45-minute workout that offers a bit of everything (i.e., light toning, a bit of cardio, and plenty of stretching) and is likely to appeal to a wide audience; I would definitely recommend it!",1344556800,4,3872,5.140575079872204
3349246,5,B0013KGWBM,"I like Skinny Sculpt a lot as it gives a great workout and results. This would probably be good for those anywhere from beginner to intermediate levels.

Although I am fairly uncoordinated and at a beginner level (somewhere between couch potato & light exerciser), I was able to learn/do the moves within a few workouts and complete it. You really do get what you put into the workout. Number 1 tip is to always control your movements to see results. Of course, using weights will yield even better results! However, I have not used weights yet.

I have being using Skinny Sculpt 4-5 days a week for 30 days. I changed my diet to eliminate as much as possible processed foods, sugar, salt, reduced fat intake and increased my water intake. I have also added lots of salads, veggies and fresh fruits.  However, I am still eating about 1,800 calories a day. This is why I have only lost 2.2 lbs in 30 days.  However, I have lost a combined total of 6 inches (in): 0.5 in (chest), 1.5 in (waist), 1.25 in (hips), 1.25 in (arms) and 1.5 in (legs). In addition to the weight loss and lost inches, I have also noticed an increase in energy and flexibility as well as better posture.

I am delighted with my results as my top goals were (and are) to increase my activity level and tone up. I am certain I would have lost more weight *if* I had reduced my daily caloric intake.

3349247,4,B0013KGWBM,"This is the second workout that I have tried in Ellen Barrett's studio series.  Although I didn't click very well with some of her older workouts (e.g., Crunch Pick Your Spot Pilates), I recently tried and loved her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fusion-Flow/dp/B0031SD4G0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fusion Flow</a>, so I thought I would look into to some of her other newer DVDs.

As with all of her studio workouts, Ellen performs this routine barefoot in a large, open studio.  She has two background exercisers, Debra and Meg, who modifies the exercises to be performed without weights.  The only equipment used is a mat and LIGHT weights (at most 3#, but even that felt heavy to me for many of the movements).  The Main Menu offers options for Play All, Chapter Selection, and Greetings from the Studio!

Although this workout is well-chaptered, the chapters flow into each other rather than have defined start/end points.  However, I will use the names which appear on the chapter menu to describe each segment in greater detail below (all times are approximate).

Warm-Up (5 minutes)
Ellen begins with gentle breaths in and out, arm circles, and plies; she concludes the warm-up with an inner thigh stretch.

Side Leg Lift Series (5.5 minutes)
Ellen picks up the weights for this segment and begins with a side arm lift, palms up/palms down.  She transitions into side-to-side leg lifts, continuing with arm movements.  This move ends with a squat circle.  She also performs ""butterfly arms"" (wide, circling arms) while doing plies from side-to-side.  She repeats the whole series, this time lifting the leg to the rear.

Plie Stance Series (9.5 minutes)
Ellen continues to use the weights for even more arms work in this section.  Standing in a Pilates stance, she performs moves including side reaches, shoulder presses, big circles with plies, triceps overhead presses, sun arms, Pilates arm circles, Pilates chest expander, and additional butterfly arms.  The legs get just a bit of work with a set of static lunges to either side.

Pulley Arms Lunge (9.5 minutes)
The name of this segment describes the first move:  a single leg lunge with a one-arm ""pulley"" move to the rear.  Additional moves include whisps around the body, back extensions with lasso arms, single and double arm rows, and again, just a bit of legs work with skater squats.

Mat Work (10.5 minutes)
Ellen begins here with a twisting move from a reclined seated position.  She then comes to lying for some Pilates-inspired matwork, including single leg stretch, ballerina criss-cross, partial to full rollup, and knee drops (progressively adding increased challenge).

Final Stretch (5 minutes)
Ellen starts the stretch in cobbler's pose for a rocking butterfly move; she also performs some hip lifts.  Additional stretches include a seated twist, cross-legged forward bend, and brief neck/shoulder stretches to finish.

Overall, I enjoyed this workout.  It definitely had more of an upper body emphasis, although I was aware of that going in.  However, I found it a bit difficult to find the right amount of weight to use consistently throughout the workout.  I started off with 3#, but this quickly felt too heavy.  I switched to 2#, which was better, but I found that I liked doing some movements, such as the butterfly arms, much better without the weights.  So, the second time I did the workout, I tried it WITHOUT the weights for most of the exercises (I still used weights for the tricep work and rows), and I found this to be much more to my liking, as I got better range of motion from the movements.

I am glad I discovered Ellen's studio series and would definitely recommend these DVDs.",1341273600,2,3723,5.095709570957096

I didn't feel this video was much of a cardio style video like her others, but great for toning perhaps, after some cardio. She makes everything look so easy, but the next day you really feel it. I've combined this video with her Burn and Firm Pilates (for Cardio) since this video is such an arm focus. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants a great arm work out.",1330560000,,541,4.313725490196078

In the middle of it I had to drop my 3-pound weights, because it simply became too much! Great for those women who like to break a sweat and feel their muscles burn. Some of the moves were a liitle complicated, like ""the wisp"", which also put some strain on my lower back, but, boy, did I feel my arms and inner thighs burn with other moves!

I have been working out almost every day faithfully for the last couple of months and have been doing more grueling videos such as the Kettlebells series, the ""90 day shred"" series and Jillian Michaels.  When I went to do this, I figured I was ""taking it easy"" for the day.  Even though she said no more than 3 pounds, I figured since I was using weights almost daily I could use my 6 pounders.  Well it was pretty tough with my 6 pound weights and I couldn't do the whole thing with that high of weights.  As others have mentioned, she is very likeable and not annoying and the time goes by pretty fast.  Some videos I am looking at the time, hoping it will end and didn't feel that way with this one.  I also agree that it isn't as grueling as a lot of the other videos out there so I stil consider it one of my ""easier"" videos but it was still good and I would recommend.",1326758400,2,897,4.091428571428572

This workout is completely low impact (yay!). There is no jumping, extreme flexing/lunging, etc. I used 2lb hand weights and my arms were ON FIRE. I was dripping sweat within 20 minutes of this workout. What I like about this workout is the principle of not building bulk, only getting lean and long. That is just what I need. I am glad I found Ellen Barrett and her style of working out. I will alternate her with Leslie Sansone and my usual long walks around the block. The one thing I would caution is if someone has terrible knees not to try it. There are lots of squats and the movements involve the knees and surrounding muscles quite a bit.

It is great though for getting the shoulders to drop down and release tension in the neck and shoulders, and really helps to stretch out the sides, which is an area that many workouts don't touch on very effectively. While there isn't a huge focus on the legs, the legs still do get plenty of workout since many of the exercises require movement of the whole body from side to side, or bending of the knees. There is also enough movement to get a gentle to moderate cardio workout, which for many people is more than enough. I find it a great complement to my martial arts training since it helps to sort out the tightening of muscles in the shoulders, upper back and chest, however it does get a bit tough if I have had a heavy workout with my arms in a previous day.",1300233600,4,944,4.25

Ellen is a great instructor with an excellent voice.  She cues well, and is encouraging and upbeat without ever acting hyper.  She constructs great routines that are doable but never boring.

This is a very complete workout that doesn't miss a muscle of the body although I did find the ab work to be a bit short and not quite as challenging.  The reason I gave it 4 stars was because the music was a bit annoying and there is a bit of repetition to her moves that can also bore you.

I also use Jari Love, Voight, Tamilee, etc. when I want to lift heavier than 3 lbs. to strengthen my bones and avoid osteoporosis. But for reshaping/sculpting my body, it's either Ellen or Tracy.

Back to Slim Sculpt, Ellen's moves may be repetitive but I personally don't mind. There's more upper body work here particularly the shoulders and arms 'cuz you'll feel it the next day and the floorwork emphasized on the core and butt muscles.

I find that I get a good workout, and feel really good at the end of it.

I have several fitness DVD's (Denise Austin, Kathy Smith, Suzanne Bowen, Lara Hudson, Leslie Sansone, and Chris Freytag among others) and this is a workout that I think I will use alongside my Denise Austin workouts.

The 2 shortcomings of this DVD: 1) The background music sounds weird and I would have preferred hearing something else instead! 2) I would have liked to have had the option of mixing and matching the different segments of the workout so that if I didn't feel like doing the whole 45 minutes at a stretch I could have chosen not to do so (this option is available on Denise Austin's DVD's).",1275177600,10,1170,4.5933014354066986

You will be strong, not sweat much and enjoy your workout. It's 45 minutes of attention to every muscle group, and it really does build long, firm muscle without bulk.

Ellen's cuing is extraordinary, even for a person like me who can hardly follow in an aerobics class.  Plus I have no idea how she talks and explains and encourages and keeps her breath, wow. Yes, she's a bit Valley Girl perky sometimes but I have learned to like it.

A couple small issues: On the lunge portion, Ellen explains the process so much on the right leg that she ends up doing many more lunges there than on the left.  So I change legs every day to accommodate that and to keep the workout even.

Absolutely wonderful, the only workout DVD you need....just do it, every day.",1273104000,44,1171,4.339449541284404

3349325,5,B0013KGWBM,"This workout is the one I turn to when looking for a Pilates type strengthening workout. It helps me get into ""golf shape"" and usually feel it the next day. If I need more aerobics, then I do a short 30 minute workout prior to this one. I love Ellen and have several of her workout dvds. She's very good at cuing the next move and her voice is happy and encouraging - which makes it a fun workout. I always feel good after her workouts. If you're just starting out, Ellen shows easier levels on all moves and you progress as you build strength.",1272067200,3,544,4.190476190476191
3349326,5,B0013KGWBM,"I found this workout to be quite challenging. While there is alot of emphasis on working the arms & shoulders, there is also plenty targeting other areas throughout. The chair sequence for example, is a little different than on any of her other videos and I know I am trembling by the end of that segment. I have been doing a rotation of Ellen's videos every week for a year with this being my most recent one, so I am definitely no beginner, and I had to pause a few times throughout the first few times I did it. I thought my arms were going to fall off. The mat workout at the end is great too, with different moves she hadn't done before. I am definitely feeling my inner thighs after Skinny Sculpt. This video has worked WONDERS for my tricep definition. Definitely one of my favorite Ellen videos!",1271980800,20,803,4.36
3349327,4,B0013KGWBM,"I love Ellen Barrett and truly believe you can't go wrong with her workouts. This DVD is no exception. It effectively works your arms (especially your shoulders) while elevating your heart rate and leaving you feeling great afterward. My only complaint (and the reason I'd give this workout four stars instead of five) is that for Ellen junkies who've been faithfully doing her Studio workouts, it would be nice if they increased in difficulty, or if she released some workouts for more advanced exercisers. This workout is lovely, but it didn't seem any more rigorous than her earlier ""Slim Sculpt"" release, and her other two latest releases also seemed on par or even easier than the earlier ones. I didn't feel any muscle soreness after Skinny Sculpt, even though I definitely felt the ""burn"" during the workout. I'd love to see these workouts stepped up a notch to provide an extra challenge!!",1271808000,36,897,4.907894736842105
3349328,5,B0013KGWBM,"This is a great arm workout.  I especially feel the workout in my shoulders and am liking the shape I am seeing already.  Amazing what a set of three lb. weights can do.  As usual, Ellen delivers an energetic and motivating work out.  I like the mat workout at the end also because Ellen introduced some moves that I had not seen before in her other dvds.  I remain a big fan of Ellen's and especially like her studio series (PS: I like the new carpet in the studio too - looks great).  My only minor complaint is that during the second half of the dvd, the music seems to get louder and I struggle to hear Ellen's instruction so I turn up the volume but then the music is even louder and so on.  This might just be the copy of the dvd I have.  Overall, I highly recommended Skinny Skulpt.  It's enjoyable. How often can you say that about a workout dvd?",1269907200,7,854,4.158536585365853
3349329,5,B0013KGWBM,"I have to say, this workout puts a smile on my face! Very calm and peaceful yet invigorating and challenging. Ellen rivals Tracy Anderson's arm toning in this one! Your arms will feel sore after this workout. In a good way! She uses light weights and big ranges of motion but also has a modifier if you would rather do the workout without weights. In my opinion, Ellen hit it out of the park with this one. You probably will feel like dropping your arms at time during this workout but that's a good thing! I love the graceful blend of strengthening and toning that is incorperated into this workout. Feel good, challenging, and wonderful!",1269475200,9,639,4.565217391304348
3349330,5,B0013KGWBM,"I would love to say, this workout delivers! I felt it for days afterwards in my arms and my arms were pretty used to being worked from Tracy Anderson's dvds. I love how this workout has some of the same principals, long fluid movements with light weights and big ranges of motion. I love how cheerful Ellen is it makes the 45 minutes zip by!! And working out barefoot is surprisingly relaxing (you don't have to find your shoes or make excuses like, 'ahh my shoes are in the other room' lol. I cannot recommend this enough especially if you want to be strong, lean and mean. This is not for a body builder type physique but will still challenge. I highly recommend this for intermediate exercisers or even advanced ones who want a graceful workout. Beginners- don't despair you can do this too! Ellen has a great modifier!! I also loved how this worked the whole body even though the arm section was a standout (you actually spend 30 minutes with approx. 3 lb weights!) Her matwork is invigorating and hits trouble zones. Amen!! :)",1269475200,41,1031,4.548387096774194

I absolutely love this workout!!!  In the past I have not enjoyed weights so much (prefer aerobics or power walking), but this workout never gets boring and you really can feel your muscles working -plus, you get an aerobic workout with this as well.

The moves are simple and the pace is perfect (not too intensive that you might want to quit, but you will not get bored and turn it off). The best part about using Ellen's workouts, you might not feel sore after the workout... but the next morning you will!!!

3349353,3,B0013KGWBM,"I love most everything about this DVD but it does have an emphasis on upper body work with many reps of arm raises above the shoulder and over the head. If you have had any kind of shoulder injury I would approach cautiously.  I have strong shoulders as a competitive swimmer but I found that even without weights this workout nags at an old shoulder injury.  This isn't a workout I can do very frequently because of that.  I love the music and the ballet and pilates moves so I will try from time to time.  It will be an occasional change of pace, not a standard for me.",1254787200,11,571,4.2110091743119265

Swimming gives a very good workout but,  when I've done this dvd I find my muscles a little sore the next day. So  it seems this workout is targeting different muscles. I find the workout to be easy to do even for the first time. Ellen is good in her instructions & the workout is not a real fast pace one. Perhaps this is why the workout is effective, slowing down makes it harder for the muscles because you don't use momentum. I find my heart rate in my target zone when doing this workout. I have seen Ellen Barrett on Fit TV & like her Slow Aerobics, so I figured I'd give this one a try. I was not disappointed! This workout combines weights (1lb.or what you can handle), yoga and dance & is not difficult at all to do.

I can only imagine the benefits this program would have for those with ""normal"" spines.  Ellen is so pleasant.  She is like having your most non-judgemental best friend right in your living room, encouraging you to be the best you can be.

For me, SS is the hardest of the three due to the upper body work with weights (I only had two pound weights but will try it with one pounders). This has Ellen's signature moves: skater, second position plies, lunges, butterfly and some very unique and nice stretches at the end. I am a workout junkie, low intermediate, and highly recommend The Studio series. I am alternating all three with great results.",1244505600,,456,4.6419753086419755

I'd absolutely recommend this for an ""off"" day.  Besides the light workout, Ellen always has an upbeat attitude and makes you really want to do your best.

3349361,5,B0013KGWBM,"This workout uses light weights (3 lbs) to tone the arms and shoulders, without building bulky muscles. I was amazed at how challenging 3 lb weights can be (I usually use 5 or 8 lbs with Kathy Smith). I can barely make it through all the exercises with the 3 lb weights and feel sore and great the next day. It's true, there's not much lower body emphasis, so I don't think this workout would be great on its own, but combined with Ellen's Yogini and Fat Burning Fusion DVDs with both focus more on the lower body, it's perfect. Slim Sculpt also contains some great standing core work, and works well with Ellen's Fat Burning Pilates or Self workouts, which I also love.

Ellen's programs aim to create that long, lean, and yet strong female physique without building bulk.  This one is no exception.  I use a pair of 3-lb weights and feel great each time I'm done with this workout. It not only works your upper body, but also your core, glutes and legs.

8251553,4,B0013KGWBM,"I have about six Ellen Barrett DVDs.  I started working out with years ago when she was with Crunch and continued to follow her to these Studio workouts.  I'm a long distance runner, I do P90x and Jillian Michaels, but Pilates is my go to for long lean muscle and for strengthening my core.  I love Ellen's style and cuing - always have, which is why I have been such a faithful follower of her DVDs.  I bought this one because I wanted another weighted pilates work out.  I own Burn and Firm (one from her Crunch series) and always enjoyed that, so I decided to give this a go.  First, the pros:  I fell like this really works your shoulders and arms.  As I said before, I do P90x regularly and my arms burn with this workout just holding three pound weights.  There is one section in particular that is almost pure agony with arm circles followed by a static hold on one arm with a pulley move with the other -- it hurts so good.  The legs also get a pretty good workout, though not as good as in some of her other DVDs, more attention seems to be given to the arms, but this can be remedied  a bit by dropping your stance a bit in the plie, while doing some of the arm exercises - but it might be harder to maintain good form with some of the exercises.  The mat exercises are great and feel effective.  The cons:  My only complaint with this workout really is that I find myself watching the clock more than I normally do with her workouts.  I don't enjoy it as I do others.  I like the attention to the arms and I feel like it is worth doing....but I really can't quite put my finger on what it is that makes this one, in particular, less appealing to me than others.  Maybe it's just the pain that my arms are in or maybe it's the lack of good background music....I'm really not sure, though I think I'm leaning towards the latter.  I just don't feel motivated with this one....I still do it, but I'm forcing myself through it, while with others I've done, I feel like the exercises flow well and I hardly notice the time.",1488412800,4,2028,4.196382428940568

It's fantastic.  What I like about it is this: 1) she workouts out upper and lower body at the same time, so you are not wasting precious time,  2) when she works one side of the body, she gives you a break and does something different before working out the other side - so it's not monotonous, 3) she has a great personality, 4) she works out barefoot on a mat, which I love, although you could certainly wear sneakers and 5) I feel like I've had a great, healthy overall workout for my body after doing this, and it's all without jumping around, but seriously working all muscles of the body.  I really recommend adding this DVD to your collection.",1480291200,,822,4.339869281045751
