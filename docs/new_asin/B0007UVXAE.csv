2245077,5,B0007UVXAE,"This is a great box set. Sure, the design with DVDs over each other is not ideal and can make getting the volume you want tricky, but for this price its worth it. I actually got this box set a few years ago when I was broke and was so happy to see that the price was manageable as this is one of my favorite series. As other reviews have said, it doesn't have all the special features, or really anything that die-hard fans might be itching for, but its still well worth the price to have all of season one.",1292716800,,507,4.02970297029703
2245078,4,B0007UVXAE,"This economy box is great! The series is really good and the ending is very deep...I can't wait till I have the money to buy the second season..This set has both the dubbed and the japanese with subtitles  version and interviews with the american cast including the actress who plays Mokona who did both the Japanese and the

American versions...I had a bit of trouble playing the Omake endings and an alternate theme songs on the special features area I would click on it and my dvd player would stop but that's really the only downside I saw. Mokona was what attracted me to this series since I had enjoyed him in Tsubasa Resevior War Chronicles the manga..and yes Mokona is a boy...however in this series there is only the white Mokona and his entire language is pu! There is also a bonus disc containing two interviews with the Japanese director and someone else who I have yet to watch. Overall this series is wonderful and worth the money and will make you keep watching to the end! I am really glad I bought this series.",1145923200,,1027,4.516129032258065
2245079,4,B0007UVXAE,"Magic Knight Rayearth is a work from clamp that takes the best (and worst) of all the anime world.  This is not your run of the mill anime series.

First, you must be patient with MKR...its begins rather slow and gives little or no background about the characters.  It is also emotional.  I find that refreshing, because many anime series are all about panty shots and robots...ie MOLDIVER.  The animation is NOT upto par with clamp's manga, or even cardcaptor sakura.  The animation reminds me of NADIA or something from the late 80's.

But the facinating and complex storyline pulls you in.  And when the mecha finally shows up (The RUNE GODS), its Awesome.  It is not as detailed as Gundam, but apparently, the ladies get hit whenever the mecha gets hit.  Yep, there's a bit of blood in this series (would have made a perfect show for FOX and they wouldn't have to butcher it like they did Escaflowne).

That what it reminded me of, with the robots, the girls and emotion of the show, Escaflowne. There are no panty shots (the potential is there) and the violence is as mild as Macross. I don't even know why its 13 and up.  There's body lines (ie Sailor Moon), but no profanity and no overtly sexual details.  The end of the series WILL MAKE YOU GO BUY MKR2.  By the way...Rayearth is Hitomi's Rune God.  He doesn't show up until the end of the series. The Dubbed V.A.'s and the opening and closing songs dubbed and in its original Japanese is high pitched and annoying.

I got so emotionally connected in the series...The ending made me angry...I found myself yelling at the characters like they could hear me.  Dragon Ball never made me do that.  That's why MKR should be a part of any Anime lover's possession.",1143504000,7,1717,4.537459283387622
2245080,5,B0007UVXAE,"Magic Knight Rayearth.  Even the title is filled with a sense of wonder and fantasy.  In this 20-episode first season, Shidou Hikiru, Hououji Fuu, and Ryuuzaki Umi are all transported from Tokyou Tower to the land of Cephiro by a princess who needs their help.

The storyline starts out quite simple and familiar to those of the magical girls genre.  Girls, accompanied by cute animal sidekick, set out to save the world meeting interesting allies and enemies.  But, MKR takes a very interesting twist at the end, one that makes even the filler episodes well worth the wait.

There's the story, now to review the actual set.  I was thrilled when I realized that there was an economy box being created.  It doesn't have any inserts, and I dislike the way the dvds are placed into the package (they overlap each other), but if you're looking to get this series and don't care about all the bells and whistles, then this is what you want.  No frills, just a great anime series at an amazing price.",1125619200,18,994,4.6022727272727275

8052081,4,B0007UVXAE,"My only complaint is as mentioned before, the disks over lap weirdly and I'm nervous about scratching.

8052083,5,B0007UVXAE,"Anime fantasy is a genre that has been forgotten in the past years. There used to be anime like Slayers and The Record of Lodoss War, but many seem to overlook Rayearth. This anime begins with three middle school girls who are on a field trip to the Tokyo Tower. They are immediately whisked away to a fantasy land known as Cephiro. Hikaru, Umi, and Fuu are tasked to rescue Princess Emeraude from High Priest Zagato. They quickly learn magic and make many friends while they are in this world. They also meet the mascot of the series, as well as other Clamp series such as Tsubasa and Xxxholic. This character is known as Mokona, a white rabbit like creature that guides the three girls through Cephiro.

During their adventures, the girls acquire the power of the Rune Gods, which allow the girls to use giant robot looking beings to fight against their enemies. This show is not really a mecha series, so don't worry if you are not into mecha. The series is about overcoming your weaknesses and also about friendship. The first half of the show (20 episodes) is about finding the Rune Gods, and the second half of the show (27 episodes) is about using the Rune Gods to defeat the enemy forces. This particular collection covers the first half of the series.

The collection comes from the distributor, Media Blasters, and the menus look rather old for this set. The menu cursor moves very slowly, and the voice actress interviews seem to be really hard to hear; you'll have to turn the volume up on those. Also note that the opening and closing songs are sung in English, not in the native Japanese like any other anime series. I am not sure why the DVD defaults to the English songs or why they exist in the first place. There was nothing wrong with the Japanese songs; they are good. This also applies to the second collection as well.

Overall, this is a very good anime series. It is probably the best of Clamp's earlier works. However, this collection ends on a big cliffhanger, which is probably one of the best plot twists in any anime series. Therefore, you must purchase the second collection immediately to find out what happens. It is true that this anime was made in the 90's and does not look on par with current anime, but it should not deter someone's interest in this show. If you are interested in this series, you should check out the manga as well. The characters look even better in the manga; their eyes look very detailed, even more than they do in the anime.",1381190400,,2484,4.527839643652562
8052084,5,B0007UVXAE,"MKR is vintage clamp that is totally worth a look if you haven't yet.  It sits nicely in some cross-genre niche of magical girl and mecha.  I think it has as much appeal to males as females.  Great action, great animation, and great character development.",1359936000,,255,4.622222222222222
8052085,5,B0007UVXAE,Thanks really do enjoy it. Great to watch. Great condition. The only thing is it does not fill the tv screen but really like it.,1355875200,,128,4.16
