2714258,5,B000LV6VZG,"Dora is always fun and educational.  My kids have all of the Dora's, and this one is no exception.  I believe the early introduction of Spanish has given them a good start, my 2 1/2 year old son blurts our Spanish phrases or verbs on a regular basis.",1215216000,4,250,4.1875

2714261,5,B000LV6VZG,"After renting this movie at the movie store for my children (2 and 4) and then having to return it under protest, I decided to buy the DVD. It has two epsiodes on it that are particularly good: my son (2) loves the ""Bugga Bugga"" episode, and my 4-year-old daughter absolutely adores the jokes in ""a Crown for King El Bobo."" If you are looking for a crowd-pleasing Dora video that meets the needs of multiple ages, I'd recommend this title! My children's total interest in this one makes any ocassional annoying overtones of Dora tolerable.",1187049600,11,539,4.625
