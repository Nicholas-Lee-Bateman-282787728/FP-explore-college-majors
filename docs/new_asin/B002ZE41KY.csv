But, truth be told ICP never payed for the rights to sell this from the jump
I seen this on VHS back in 1996 I traded my copy of ECW Massacre of Queens Bld. for ICP's Stranglemania
made a dubbed copy of it then got my master copy of ECW back
Needless to say there were 2 dozen or so copies of Strangelmania being circulated through-out my high school within less then a month

This is a interesting must see version of the infamous 1995 IWA King of Deathmatch tournament
But, get the VHS version this dvd is terrible the PQ is rough
I'm sure they took the vhs version and transferred it to dvd  (Playboy does this with there dvd's too)
The only saving grace to this Collector's Edition is you get both volumes of
Stranglemania 1 and 2
Plus 3 never-before seen matches (aka recycled footage with new audio play by play with ICP)
It's a fun party type video but, only hardcore pro wrestling fans will want to throw the price down for the Collector's Edition dvd
It's simply not worth it....
it's not digitally remastered and you're save with the vhs home video versions
Stranglemania  volume 1 for entertainment value is a solid 9.5/10
  The dvd however is terrible cheap garbage  4/10",1451347200,,1213,4.441441441441442
8384705,5,B002ZE41KY,Do you like listening to Clowns make belligerent fun of washed up wrestlers? Ever wanted to see a wrestler turn into a werewolf turn into a bat mid-match? Into completely baked hair-pies? You've found what you've been looking for all of your life.,1418774400,2,247,4.767441860465116
8384706,5,B002ZE41KY,"After all the years of just having the VHS copies of these classic wrestling tapes from ICP we finally have an official 2 DVD set. And best of all they even gave us three bonus matches that feel like a preview of ""Strangelmaina 3"". If you're a fan of wrestling and/or ICP this DVD will not disappoint. The commentary by the Clowns is some of the funniest stuff I've ever heard. Well worth the price of admission by itself. The matches are some of the bloodiest and most violent wrestling you will ever see. Thumbtacks, barbed wire baseball bats, fire, glass and just about anything you can think of is used to mutilate during these deathmatches. The highlights of the set include a match from these two tough Japaneses guys using real thumbtacks. Not those wimpy ones they use nowadays. Real thumbtacks. You'll see what I mean when you watch Vol 1. Plus the classic exploding ring no rope barbed wire bed of death match between Terry Funk and Cactus Jack. It's great having this in my DVD collection after all the years of waiting. The only negative I can think of is that the 10 minuets of ""Big Money Hustlas"" is nowhere to be found on the DVD's. The three bonus matches more then make up for it though.",1294617600,3,1204,4.4772727272727275
