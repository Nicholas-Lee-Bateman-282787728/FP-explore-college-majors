1058423,5,6305661723,"I have never taken a yoga class but I found this tape easy to follow and still a bit challenging which is what I wanted.. What I was surprised at was that every time I have completed the whole tape I end up falling asleep after the relaxation session.. Since I have such difficulty sleeping this is an added ""bonus"" for me.. I definately recommend this tape to anyone who is starting out!!",998179200,2,389,4.342465753424658
1058424,5,6305661723,"I am a 46-year-old woman who began practicing yoga--off and on, and with several different teachers--since I was 18 years old.  I cannot say enough great things about Alan Finger.  He is truly the best yoga teacher I have ever learned from.  For years, I have done these postures without clear directions about exactly how every muscle should be held and positioned.  Believe me, doing the poses with the muscles engaged properly makes a huge difference!  I agree with the others who have written here that the best part about this tape is that I really enjoy doing it.  I am not a person who normally enjoys exercise, but this tape makes me feel as if I am pampering myself.
I have neck and back problems, and the minute I feel my neck getting tense, I know it's time to do this tape.  Alan Finger has the best series of neck-tension-releasing exercies I have ever done.  I feel the difference immediately.  I have been to many chiropractors for my neck over the years and none have helped me any more than the exercises on this tape.  The best part is that I have learned that I can stop a bad neck from ever happening because I have learned to listen to my body and help those muscles relax before I am in a crisis.
This may not be the most challenging workout, but for a person who wants to be gently guided into the beautiful, healing art of yoga, I can't think of a better place to start.",994809600,51,1394,4.368217054263566
1058425,5,6305661723,"I'm new to Yoga.  My daily workout takes place in a small, converted bedroom that doubles as a storage facility.  I'm not terribly flexible, not good about remembering to breathe, and don't look like the attractive women in this tape (and never will...yoga or no yoga).  I also don't have the room to store, nor budget to purchase special Yoga chairs, mats, pillows, or clothing.
Alan Finger's teaching style is perfect for me.  His delivery is deliberate and well paced, and his reminders to breathe and to release muscle tension are consistently timed for beginners like myself who are often so focused on twisting and balancing into an unfamiliar posture that they forget to breathe.  Unlike other Yoga tapes I've tried that pulled and pushed me through their exercise regimens, Finger's tape - in figurative terms - transports me from one pose to another, giving me the time I need to orient myself and my blood pressure to each new posture.  And, unlike the exercises contained in other Yoga tapes (such as the Rodney Yee series), Finger's exercises do not require the use of special equipment -- which means a lot to me in my space-starved exercise area.
To say that this tape focuses on conditioning and stress relief does it an injustice.  It also serves as a great introduction to Yoga for folks who aren't flexible, aren't health-nuts, aren't budding-Buddhists, and who are easily discouraged from taking the time to take care of themselves.  Finger has come up with a teaching method and series of postures that are effective, encouraging, relaxing, and immediately achievable.  I'm looking forward to purchasing other tape in the Yoga Zone series.",991526400,178,1659,4.96028880866426

I use this one almost every day, alternating it with most of the other tapes in this newest series. Alan is a gentle, thorough teacher, and his videos are comforting, yet highly effective and energizing at the same time.

A great beginner tape, it's  made a real difference in my tension level. I'd tried Patricia Walden's  Yoga for Beginners which seemed too disjointed, useful if you want to learn  but not if you want a ""class.""

Alan is great for beginners who are new to the concept of yoga, he explains things well, offers modifications for those who have back problems or a just starting to get in shape, and isn't annoyingly ""soothing"".

One of the nice things is having two poses demonstrated by two teachers (Michelle, and Lisa Bennett). There are times I'd do the easier pose because I am not that flexible. This video did address some of the key points in Yoga practicing which is easily overlooked as something simple.

1058620,5,6305661723,"I loved my Yoga Zone Conditioning & Stress Release VHS (part of a boxed set I purchased in 1997) so much that I brought it with me when I moved to Europe. Afraid that the tape would wear out or the recorders become obsolete I now own it in DVD! I'm sure blu-ray is next...

11 years ago as a former ballet dancer I needed a way to stay supple and stress free after I quit dancing. Now as a Pilates teacher I use this tape to start my day relaxed and stretched. It is the perfect antithesis for an active Pilates teacher who regularly uses her core. I also love the momentum of this tape to get my day started, working out aches and pains. The clear and precise information Alan Finger imparts develops  body awareness, an important aspect to owning a body. Much like a car, one must listen to the rattles and wheezes to know when to add oil or send it for a tune-up. Mr. Finger has a soothing voice and he never says too much going slowly enough to make it a pleasurable session everytime, even after 11 years! It is the perfect meditative way to start my day.

Lastly, I was also able to use Conditioning and Stress Release at home while doing physical therapy to rehabilitate my shoulder after  arthroscopy for a torn supraspinatus tendon. Routinely and gently doing the many neck and shoulder stretching exercises finally helped me to realize my goal of almost 100% full use of my arm.

I recommend this tape for anyone interested in starting yoga. The boxed set which includes this DVD is perfect for continuing on with meditation and the asanas.",1220572800,4,1550,4.424561403508772
1058621,2,6305661723,"This video is way too basic, and you barely get anything out of it.  Too much talking and not enough flowing.  If you're a beginner, start with the intermediate videos.  They're just as easy to follow, but you get more out of them.",1214611200,,231,4.325581395348837
1058622,5,6305661723,"I have several yoga DVDs and VHS tapes, but Alan Finger and Yoga Zone are among my favorites. This particular title, ""Conditioning and Stress Release"" is one I use the most. I think it adequately addresses both flexibility/strength and stress release, and no matter how many times I do this DVD I do not tire of the moves. Alan is very soothing to listen to, and describes the asanas so well that you need not look at the screen to know what you should do after the first few viewings. I had this in VHS format and replaced it with DVD, I loved it that much. I take it with my portable DVD player when I travel.",1205193600,3,611,4.230769230769231
1058683,3,6305661723,"This is my second yoga DVD. I am a 32 y/o male who is trying to take up yoga as a way of dealing with chronic neck/low back pain and also stress relief. My first DVD was Element: Yoga For Beginners with Elena Brower. I felt it was excellent overall.

This DVD, however, just hasn't been very good for me. It seems less like a beginner DVD and more like a just past beginner/early intermediate stress relief type DVD. The instructor, Alan Fingers, is very thorough in his descriptions. Quiet honestly though, for stress relief, he talks entirely too much and his voice is not soothing at all. Its a non stop voice that sounds more like a professor in a lecture hall than a yoga instructor who is trying to help you relax. Elena Brower's voice and music combo was far more soothing and I had always felt an immediate sense of ease and release when starting her DVD.

Overall, I feel like this one may be good for a lot of people. I may even come back to it later after I have become more comfortable with my breathing and postures. I just didn't find it to be a good DVD for my purposes and tastes. However, considering the knowledge and instruction given are top notch and my issues are with the presentation/voice/etc., I would rate it 3 stars because it seems to have a lot of good information.",1202688000,9,1295,4.369294605809128

I have 4 Yoga Zone dvds, and this is the one I pull out when I am sore from some other vigorous activity, like hiking or a cardio class. For me, this video is less like a yoga workout and more like yoga physical therapy. Don't get me wrong, it's not easy... yoga never is! But this is the least strenuous of all of my yoga videos, and my favorite for a good stretch and some de-stressing.",1193788800,2,532,4.33
1058685,5,6305661723,"After completing this DVD more than 5 times, I can say that it really grew on me.  At first, I thought it was a bit slow because in the warm up section there are lots of neck and shoulder stretches.  At first this seems unnecessary, but after doing them a few times, I find that the tension does release and it can only be relaxed by holding.
I found the ""work out"" portion to be just enough to relieve stress, but not to re-excite you and increase your energy before bedtime.
The relaxation is long and relaxing.  Perfect for evening.
The instructor's voice is calming and peaceful.  He also explains each pose step-by-step...beginners will find this very helpful....not having to look at the screen.
I recommend this DVD for Beg-Int for evening yoga.",1191369600,5,752,4.631578947368421
1058686,4,6305661723,"Alan Finger's calming instruction style allows you to relax into each pose as you release tension and heal the body. Two yoga instructors show the exercises while Alan Finger guides you through each movement with a sense of precision. Deceptively easy stretches become a challenge when held for extended periods of time. Throughout the routine the body is calmed by breathing deeply.

You may recognize table, cat, cow, downward dog and mountain pose. If you are intermediate you may want to do this routine to increase your patience. Beginners will be happy with the slower pacing and lack of difficult postures.

1058687,5,6305661723,"I have purchased several yoga tapes in my journey to find an at home guided yoga workout as good as ones in a yoga studio. Aside from the relatively minor fact that the camera person is clearly a male (due to the inordinate amount of time focused on unnecessary close-ups of the two lovely instructor's figures) this tape really does give some innovative and very helpful stretching sequences.  Alan has the all-important yoga, tension releasing focus and commentary that helps to really you to release tension and let the day melt away. The other thing I really appreciate about this tape is the pacing. MANY of the yoga videos out there simply don't provide enough time in a posture to really release into it fully. This one doesn't make you feel rushed. I also loved the fact that at the end he doesn't make you get up, but you can stay in a relaxed corspe pose as long as you would like once the tape is finished. This tape focuses mostly on flexibility but there are a few mintues of good strengthing poses. Yoga is a very important balance to our society which focuses on strength and cardio with out tying the body's performance to the breath. Alan does a great job of drawing your focus back to the breath.  It is a great substitute for being able to actually go to a yoga class. You will be refreshed by the workout.",1186272000,5,1325,4.471074380165289
1058688,4,6305661723,"I've been interested in trying this Yoga Zone practice for some time now.  Even though I'm no longer a yoga beginner (I consider myself a solid intermediate), I had heard that this program was very relaxing, particularly for the neck, and I am always looking for yoga practices along these lines.  I have tried many of the Yoga Zone videos, but this was only my second full-length (almost an hour) practice with Yoga Zone founder Alan Finger.  The first thing I noticed about this program is that is it performed in an indoor studio; since every other YZ video I've every tried was outdoors, this was a bit disappointing but not a major factor.  The entire practice moves at a slow, relaxing pace, with long holds of the postures allowing you to really feel the release associated with each move.

Alan and his two students, Lisa and Michelle (who displays less flexible modifications) begin in a seated position with basic breathing exercises and continue with simple warm-ups, including a cross-legged seated forward bend and forward bend with a twist.  Next comes the neck release series, which involves a slow turn from side-to-side, a partial turn using the opposite hand as a weight on the top of the head, and a chin push.  A few additional moves for the shoulders follow, namely a shoulder roll and an arm pull across the chest.  Staff pose rounds out this initial seated series, which lasts about 15 minutes.  Alan then transitions you to a lying position for reclined bound angle, bridge, and double-leg back release.  Moving to hands and knees, you'll do a cat series plus some really nice wrist stretches.  The only down dog of the practice follows, and then a standing forward bend prepares you for the short standing series to come.  The standing postures include tadasana, side bend, standing back bend, forward bend, side angle pose, and a wide angle forward bend series.  You are now 35 minutes into the practice, and Alan moves back to the floor for 12 point, table, seated forward bend, thread the needle, leg extensions/lowers, single leg back release, revolved stomach pose, and finally, savasana.  As with the other longer YZ I've tried (Flexibility & Stress Release), Alan leads you through a lengthy (10 minutes) savasana that is extremely relaxing--there is something about his voice that nearly puts me to sleep every time!  The total practice time is approximately 58 minutes, but the soothing music continues into credits, so you could easily relax into savasana for a bit longer.

Although I liked this practice and did find it very relaxing, I also felt that it was a little below my current level.  At this point, I have other relaxing yoga videos which I prefer to this one, particularly Benagh's Yoga for Stress Relief and Yoga in the Garden of Serenity (the latter has amazing neck stretches which go way beyond what is offered here).  Still, this is an excellent beginning yoga program, and I think it would also be a good fit for those who usually don't enjoy yoga but are looking for a relaxing, full-body stretch routine.",1174521600,8,3059,4.827586206896552
1058689,5,6305661723,This DVD is someone who wants to start with Yoga. These poses have power to remove stress and make you feel sound. And yeah... Alan's voice is very soothing.,1173312000,2,157,4.448275862068965
1058690,5,6305661723,"This was definately a good buy.  I bought this because I was having some back problems and thought maybe this would give me some relief.  It did that and more.  While it can be challenging-the stretching, the directions are every clear, and the result is awesome.  I could feel myself loosening up throughout and then the relaxation at the end is the kicker.

1058691,5,6305661723,Love this DVD. It is a practice for everyone. We all need stress relief and this DVD does the trick. Alan Finger is a master at working the kinks out of the body. Not all yoga needs to be like a boot camp. It is much more than that. This DVD proves that you can get great health benefits from yoga with out having to jump up and down like an 80's aerobic class. This is great for men and women. I will use it everyday.,1154908800,6,418,3.872093023255814
1058692,5,6305661723,"When I decided to give yoga a try, this was the first tape I bought, and I still return to it regularly.

For beginners, this is an excellent tape for learning. Alan Finger is great at explaining how to do the different stretches correctly, and he goes just slowly enough that you don't feel rushed. (However, I do advise following Mr. Finger's advice and watching the tape at least once the whole way through before actually trying it.)

For the more advanced, this tape is a nice way to unwind and get rid of tension. I've had problems with muscle tension in my back for over a year now, and this routine is the only thing I've found that loosens up my back where I need it.

I always feel refreshed and relaxed after doing this routine, and I recommend this tape to anybody, no matter how advanced.",1143417600,8,801,4.398648648648648
1058766,4,6305661723,"The best part of the Yoga Zone series is the level of instruction in how to perform the poses.  Alan Finger and his crew understand that mere observation and vague, vapid monologues about relaxation and breathing do not sufficiently explain yoga poses and practices.  Yoga Zone instructors do point out how yoga can lead to inner harmony and abstract notions of spirituality and being, but the majority of the series is spent telling and showing you how to perform yoga safely, emphasizing that yoga is not about competition with others, but with the self.  Some instructors are better than others, and some routines feel like repetitions of other DVDs.  I am writing this introduction to all of the Yoga Zone DVDs I own.  The following pertains to this particular DVD.

Yoga Zone's Conditioning and Stress Relief is a great starting point for beginners.  You can do this routine for a long time before having to move to different routines.  The main reason for this is that the full and modified forms of the poses are quite different in their levels of difficulty.  My main complaint is that the DVD is not longer.  The routine needs an extra ten to fifteen minutes.  Not enough time is spent on releasing the muscles in your neck, hips, and groin, which are generally the seats of the most stress.  I find myself pausing the DVD to perform extra long neck and hip/groin poses and exercises.

Yoga Zone founder Alan Finger leads this routine.  He comes off as a little pretentious and corny at first, but if you ignore his delivery you will find that he is excellent at explaining how to do the poses, including proper breathing.  This is especially important for those new to yoga.  I recommend this DVD for beginners to yoga and for those who desire a lighter routine.",1141344000,12,1772,4.704545454545454
1058767,5,6305661723,"I'm very new to Yoga and I love this DVD.  I love it so much I will purchase other DVD's in the same Yoga Zone Series.  I can see now, why Yoga is so wonderful!  This tape doesn't make a beginner feel as if they are contorting their bodies in a strange form with no instruction.  The instructions are clear and easy to follow.  Workout is simple and great for beginners!",1140998400,3,370,4.154929577464789
1058768,5,6305661723,"I just did this program this morning and as usual Alan Finger and his Yoga Zone instructors were perfection!

 This particular program is on the gentle side, about an hour long and is sequenced beautifully. It features Lisa Bennett (Matkin) and Michelle Carillo (who does the modified version of the poses) with Alan Finger leading the session.

 Being firmly in my mid forties, and having had my share of trauma to my body do to various mishaps such as car wrecks, falls etc. I definitely have my share of aches and pains when I wake up each morning. Thanks to a daily Yoga practice for the last 9 years I have found a way to overcome much of those ailments and can honestly say I'm in the best shape of my life.

 A big part of my home practice (I have over 90 Yoga programs on either VHS/DVD) are Yoga Zones excellent programs.

 This particular program starts seated and does various movements to open up the back, shoulders and neck. It continues to move the body through various asana from all fours, supine and standing before eventually bringing you back down to seated postures and then lying in Savasana (a pretty long guided Savasana).

 I started this morning's practice a bit stiffer than usual and I can honestly say as I'm typing this that I feel great, pain free and really open in my body!

 This is a program that could be used by someone quite new to yoga though perhaps a brand new beginner might want to start with Yoga Zone's ""Introduction to Yoga"" or the shorter ""Yoga Zone Basics"" (which has two 20 minute segments).

 I can see that this program will be part of my regular practice for those days when I want a longer but gentle practice. For me it really felt like a moving meditation.

 Alan Finger is the real deal! He is one of the true master Yoga teachers in the West and has taught many of the top Western yoga teachers including Rod Stryker. He was taught by his father Mani Finger who was a disciple in the lineage of authentic Indian Yoga Masters such as Paramansa Yogananda and Swami Sivananda. He was later initiated into Tantric Kriya Yoga by Kavi Shudananda Bharati.

 I highly recommend this!

1058769,5,6305661723,I originally purshased the Yoga Zone beginner video set.  Somehow lost this video and wanted to replace it with a DVD.  I have a lot of joint and muscle pain and this video is extremely helpful in relieving my symtoms. Alan Finger gives excellent directions on how to perform each pose and is completely doable by beginners.  This video is especially helpful in relieving neck and shoulder tension and I would highly recommend this video.,1126569600,10,438,4.8133333333333335
1058770,5,6305661723,"This is the best beginner's yoga video out there, period. Alan Finger's soothing voice and detailed instruction guides the student through a 60 min. practice of gentle stretches followed by the best guided relaxation I've found on any yoga video. The background music is pleasant and unobtrusive. Two women demostrate the poses to Alan's narration, one doing modifications you can follow if you're not up to the full form of the pose yet. I've culled many of the beginner videos out of my collection, but this is one I'll never get rid of; it's perfect for low energy days when I know yoga will make me feel better, but I'm not up to a more vigorous session.",1116028800,24,658,4.632478632478633
1058771,5,6305661723,"This video was my first experience with yoga. Alan Finger has an extremely soothing voice, and he is supportive and encouraging. If you can't complete a stretch at an advanced level, you don't feel like a clumsy idiot. The poses are demonstrated at different difficulty levels, and the instructions are very clear. The exercises will release tension from every part of your body. By the end, when Alan invites you to grab a pillow and blanket and close your eyes, you'll be ready to zonk out on the living room floor.",1115942400,12,517,4.6923076923076925
1058772,5,6305661723,"Yoga Zone Conditioning & Stress Release delivers what it promises. By focusing on major stress points in the body such as the neck, shoulders, wrists, pelvic area, and back, this video is the answer to my hectic days. I actually look forward to doing these exercises at the end of a long day, because it helps me relax and unwind. I do not blame the previous reviewer for actually falling asleep at the end of the session - it's that effective.  And I would have to credit Alan Finger for his soothing voice and encouraging manner of instructing yoga students.  While he gives out the instructions, his two senior yoga instructors perform the poses, with one doing the modified postures for those who are less flexible.  Two thumbs up for this video.",1087516800,5,750,4.666666666666667
1058773,5,6305661723,"I'm warning you--don't do this video in the morning when you get up, because you'll want to go right back to sleep again.
It's very relaxing. Most of the video is just stretches, but there are also some of conditioning poses which are strenuous physcially, so your muscles will feel tired when you're done. It's a nice feeling.
This video is labeled ""beginners"" and it that's appropriate because it is a very easy video. There are no props required and none of the moves require very much skill. In addition, the instructor's explanations are very detailed and easy to understand.
This would be a great starter's tape for someone who has never tried yoga before.",1068249600,2,662,4.765217391304348
1058774,5,6305661723,This video is great if you want to do Yoga but don't want a real intense work out. It is good if you would like a nice workout and a chance to unwind.  This video really helps to relax after a stressful day.  Al Finger does a great job in explaining the poses and how they help to relax you.  As well there are two other Yogis to follow depending on your skill level.  I would recommend this video for any one who is new to Yoga to help develop a appreaciation for the relaxation qualities that Yoga can bring.,1068163200,,510,4.07
1058835,4,6305661723,"I've ""dabbled"" in yoga several times over the last 10 years or so and have thoroughly enjoyed it, but have most recently been focusing on cardio/strength training.  Having lost most of the weight I've wanted to, I started looking for alternative exercise forms to help maintain the weight loss (and maintain my interest in exercise).
This video is definitely a great beginner or ""starting-again"" yoga workout.  Finger's voice is soothing and instructive without being chatty and the fact that he instructs while having two other people demonstrate is a great format (one girl does the more intense variations and the other the more basic moves).  The only negative is that it is just a tad too short (you don't want it to end) overall and the relaxation portion at the end is too long.  I definitely recommend this video, however!",1066608000,3,830,4.9071428571428575
1058836,5,6305661723,"This is the first Yoga home video I purchased, and it remains one of my favorites. The instructor, Alan Finger, has the most soothing voice and gives such clear, concise instruction.  I also like that he is not too ""new-agey"" in his language and focuses mostly on the straightforward physical benefits of this program, rather than the effects on your psyche.  I appreciate how the 2 assistants demonstrate the poses for both beginner and more advanced viewers. The conditioning portion of the video is not particularly strenuous so if you are looking for a Power Yoga workout, this tape is not for you. This program is a light workout and an amazing tension release.  I particularly love to do this video after a long, stressful day. Wash your face and brush your teeth before you start this video because if  you're like me, you will fall asleep or close to it by the end of this wonderful video!",1052179200,7,897,4.658227848101266
1058837,5,6305661723,"I bought this DVD for stress release and stretching. It is perfect for just that. It's about an hour of slow, deep stretching with a few ""conditioning"" poses thrown in. The stretches themselves are great, mixing some conventional yet effective moves with a few I'd never seen. The stretching covers areas of the body that do tend to store stress - neck, shoulders, wrists, back - in addition to more typical arm and leg stretching.
By the time I make it to the relaxation/breathing sequence at the end of the workout I tend to nod off because I am so relaxed. Because of this I use it as stretching and relaxing before bedtime. I wouldn't recommend this tape to someone looking for more intense stretching or real conditioning because this tape is not about that. It will, however, calm you and increase your flexibility whether you are a begininner who has never tried yoga or someone who already has a moderate amount of flexibility.",1048032000,7,935,4.7073170731707314
1058838,5,6305661723,"This is the best video.  Alan Finger shows you how to do the postures and positions... and explains what you should be feeling.  He tells you how to adapt the poses so that anyone can do them (fit or not...).  He works on breathing throughout the poses, which I have a hard time remembering.  I feel much better after I do the workout.  My posture is better, my body is religned, and I am much more relaxed. This is a beginner tape... but I will use it forever.  The better I get at the poses and positions the more it works.  I now have the tape memorized, but I listen to it anyway.  Alan Finger's voice is so calming and the relaxation exercise at the end is terrific. I feel like a new person when I'm done.",1042243200,3,711,4.138686131386861
1058839,5,6305661723,"This continues to be the best, most satisfying and relaxing tape I ever do.  Alan Finger does the best job of any instructor in reminding us to breathe (otherwise I forget!) and in explaining how to do the poses correctly and why.  I also like the 55-minute format much better than any shorter videos.  This length makes me feel like I've worked out without rushing every pose, gives time to really stretch, and provides enough time for relaxation.  I think Yoga Zone makes the best tapes of anyone.",1027036800,5,499,4.636363636363637
1058840,5,6305661723,This is the most relaxing video of all the yoga tapes I own.  I have most of the the Yoga zone videos.  I am not flexible enough to do some of the poses in some of their other videos.  Alan Finger's instruction is excellent and there are two instructors to show different modifications of the poses.  This is a good tape for a beginner or intermediate.,1017705600,9,352,4.287878787878788
1058841,3,6305661723,"This is ok, but in my opinion not a recommended purchase, there are better ones.",1009065600,2,80,4.4
1058842,4,6305661723,"this is a very fine yoga instruction tape.  the greatest emphasis is placed on stretching your entire body.  however the many static positions means you're getting more strengthening benefit than you realize.  it's absolutely essential for beginners to start out with a tape like this because it will help them to stretch out difficult areas like hips, hamstrings and shoulders that so often limit yogis from making it to the more advanced levels.  and more advanced types should relish the chance to hone in on the stretching aspects of yoga that tend to get lost in the more advanced power yoga workouts.
dare i say a must for any yoga collection?",1005350400,67,649,4.81981981981982
1058843,4,6305661723,"After starting yoga with this video, I practice every morning and have no problems motivating myself.  The instructors who demonstrate the poses seem to be enjoying themselves.  They make it look easy, but the instructor always reminds you that it will be easy for you one day.  I highly recommend this video as a first yoga video.  Because it's so relaxing you'll immediately feel the benefits.  You might even get hooked like me!
Yoga Zone primarily makes videos for the beginner for different aspects of yoga like the back or flexibility and toning.  (I knew that by looking at their web site - I'm not an advertiser or affiliate).",1005004800,4,634,4.770642201834862
1058844,4,6305661723,"I purchased this tape to help with my back and leg pains. I began doing this tape about 2 weeks and I feel the difference. There are two instructors so the positions are done either modified for for advance. The instructions are spoke well. It is best to watch the tape at least once before performing(this is best with all tapes).I am sleeping better and the back pain is easing up slowly. This tape is really for stress release. Removing it out of your arms, legs,back, neck, etc. If you are looking for sun salutions you will not find them here... I look for forward to purching additional Yoga Zone videos.",998611200,,610,4.504504504504505
