7909929,3,B00000IC1U,"Bela Lugosi made both good movies (Dracula)and, what some would consider,  bad movies (Bride of the Monster). I consider the movies on this disk,  somewhere in between. The Devil Bat is a lot of fun to watch. It's  definitely the better movie of the two. Scared to Death was Lugosi's only  color film, so if for no other reason, it's worth a look. The video and  sound quality for both of these movies are surprisingly good. For any fan  of Bela Lugosi, this is a must have disk.",968198400,7,479,4.386363636363637
7909930,4,B00000IC1U,"I'm like a lot of old horror movie buffs that have purchased 2nd rate copies of the rare classics because that's all that was available.  And it wasn't the poor duplication process, it was the poor surviving master tapes  that gave us an often fuzzy vision.  You could call it horrific for the  ""Devil Bat"" until the Roan group took charge.  What you will get  is a fantasically remastered version of a Bela ""must have"".  I  was taken aback by the quality of the newly mastered version on this DVD.  Kudos also for the ""Scared to Death"" remaster that shows Bela in  his colored glory.  Although it's not in as good a shape as ""Devil  Bat"", it's not bad and considering the lack of attention to early film  preservation.  Highly recommended.",943401600,35,740,4.549618320610687
