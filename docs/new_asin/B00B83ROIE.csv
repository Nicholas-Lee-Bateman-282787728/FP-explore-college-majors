5562668,4,B00B83ROIE,"My husband, whom these were for, liked them a lot. I'm now on his good gift side for Christmas holidays.",1389916800,,104,4.25
5562669,3,B00B83ROIE,"This is the best Kevin Costner film collection available on DVD or Blu-ray to date. It includes Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, Wyatt Earp, The Postman and JFK. The 4 Film Favorites is ideal for Costner fans on a budget. There are some light extras provided (trailers, interviews, etc.). These are 4 star films in a 3 star package because this works as a value pack only. These films are also available in deluxe stand-alone Blu-ray releases (sold separately).

Robin Hood is my favorite version of the legend on film.
Wyatt Earp is a western epic with some great performances.
The Postman is a futuristic adventure about a postman who inspires hope to the small group of Americans left alive.
JFK looks at the Kennedy assassination.",1379894400,4,732,4.809523809523809

5562673,5,B00B83ROIE,"Okay, I admit it. I'm a bit of a Kevin Costner fan. This 4-movie set fills the need to see something with him in it, especially Robin Hood - Prince of Thieves (I LOVE Alan Rickman as the Sheriff of Nottingham). Wyatt Earp is also Good, as is The Postman. I have yet to watch JFK.",1430438400,,279,4.0

5562696,1,B00B83ROIE,"This is a waste of money - none of the films are in the correct aspect ratio, so unless you preferred chopped-down VHS versions of movies to the way you saw them at the theater, why bother?  There's a reason you get four movies so cheaply - you're only seeing part of the films!",1397952000,8,278,4.148148148148148
5562697,5,B00B83ROIE,It was a great deal.  I like Kevin Costner and this was a way to own four that he made,1397865600,,86,3.3

If wide screen is what you want this is not the  4 Film Favorites set for you.",1395360000,8,351,4.208955223880597

8563929,4,B00B83ROIE,"I am a Costner fan so getting 4 movies for a low price works for me.  None of these are masterpieces but for the low price, its quite a bargain for cheap entertainment.  I look for deals like this and it was a good find.

The quality of the DVDs is fine.  These are not Blue Ray so if you are expecting high fidelity at the Blue Ray level, don't get these.  For every day use in a standard home theatre, these are fine.",1438214400,,419,3.9404761904761907
