 time elapsed.  I was hoping for something more like ""Trekking Forest"".  It gives you the sense of hiking, but unfortunately doesn't go to an actual destination. This was a complete waste of money.  Oh, and get rid of the goofy background music.",1516320000,,390,4.485714285714286
8568828,5,B00BI4N338,"Love this series especially with Johnny.  He encourages but isn't bugging you all the time.  They are a good pace, nice scenery and for me 35 minutes on my elliptical is all I can do at least for now.  Just wish he would do a Paris one.  I have several of this series and no dud yet.",1456012800,,283,3.912280701754386
