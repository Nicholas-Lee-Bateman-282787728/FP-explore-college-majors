A future history as scripted by the visionary writer H.G. Wells, Things To Come set a high benchmark for science fiction with its fantastic design, gigantic sets and spectacular special effects. Acknowledged as a landmark within the genre, Oscar-winning William Cameron Menzies creates an astounding vision of post-war desolation and utopian futurism.

Starring Oscar-nominated Raymond Massey as John Cabal and his descendants and the award-winning Ralph Richardson as The Boss, THINGS TO COME showcase a gorgeous, and instantly recognisable, score by Arthur Bliss. Presented for the first time in High Definition, this version of THINGS TO COME has been painstakingly restored from the remaining film elements and represents the most complete version known to exist.

It is Christmas 1940 and the people of Everytown, unprepared and ill-equipped, find themselves at war against an enemy who has been planning such a conflict for years. The land is devastated by the horrors of aerial bombardment as the war drags on for thirty years, causing a period of despair, with feudal tyrants ruling a downtrodden populace suffering famine and pestilence. Can the human race rise above its desperate circumstances and build a scientific utopia?

FILM FACT: All of Theotocopulos's scenes were originally shot with Ernest Thesiger in the role, but H.G. Wells found his performance to be unsatisfactory, so he was replaced with Cedric Hardwicke and the footage re-shot. Terry-Thomas, who would become known for his comic acting, has an uncredited appearance as an extra in the film, playing a ""man of the future."" It was his seventh film appearance.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: One of the most characteristic aspects of science fiction in the 1930s is its being influenced by another fantastic genre horror, so intensively that in many cases it is hardly possible to establish a dividing line between these two categories of fantastic creation. There are very few science fiction films which are exclusively devoted to considering scientific and societal evolution in terms of an extrapolation into the future. An exception is the Britishh film of 1936, THINGS TO COME. The book on which the film is based, The Shape of Things to Come, is a speculative continuation of H.G. Wells's The Outline of History and is, according to the author, ""basically an imaginative discussion about social and political forces and possibilities."" The story of the film covers a period of 100 years of civilization. It begins in 1940, in a time permeated by fear of an imminent war which finally explodes and lasts 25 years. During that period, the entire globe is devastated and almost all of mankind exterminated. However, the human will and spirit remain active, and so at the end of the book, in 2040, a completely different world is depicted, in which human hardships have been eliminated and man is assured of all his material as well as mental needs. Progress is unrelenting as mankind plans to leave Mother Earth and take over the universe.

Released in 1936, THINGS TO COME, and adapted by H.G. Wells from his own 1933 science fiction novel The Shape of Things to Come, was the most ambitious production to date from Alexander Korda's London Films, and cemented its reputation for producing intelligent drama on an epic scale.

H.G. Wells's work fascinated and still fascinates readers by its original images of the future. Wells himself, however, valued more highly his scientific studies than his fiction, and so the speculative aspect of  Things to Come  receives more attention than the story. The plot of the film proceeds from Wells's assumption that a war will mean the end of the Western civilization. The structure of the story is based on a conflict of two forces always present in humanity's evolution. One of them represents chaos and regression and encourages man's barbaric nature; and the other represents order, healthy reasoning, and scientific progress. When these forces collide, science and intellect win although this victory will always be threatened by other pressures, due to our imperfect understanding of how best to invest our human resources.

THINGS TO COME was an ambitious project with a vast scope - covering a century of future history and a scale to match: enormous sets, particularly in the sequences set in 2036, thousands of extras, and imaginative design and editing. Several of the performances are equally impressive, notably Raymond Massey as the messianic Cabal and Ralph Richardson as the thuggish 'Boss', a role he modelled explicitly on Mussolini and the Italian dictator's response was to ban the film outright in Italian cinemas.

However the human story at times feels overshadowed by the design, with the ending, particularly, lacking impact. The film's overwhelming seriousness is a problem, although understandable given the immediate fear of war. But it still has moments of real power, including a subtle and moving scene in which an airman [John Clements] offers his gas mask to a young girl whose town he has just attacked, as well as the dazzling montage of the re-building of Everytown.

THINGS TO COME offered a very different vision of the future to Fritz Lang's German classic Metropolis [1926], to which it was inevitably compared; H.G. Wells was scathing in his criticism of Lang's film, which offered a portrait of a world enslaved by science. By contrast, H.G. Wells saw science as a promise of mankind's salvation. But one comment that no one else has mentioned in any of the film reviews I have read, especially about this very prophetic H.G. Wells  THINGS TO COME 1936 film, is that you see near the end of the film one male and a child watching a Flat Screen Widescreen Television of times of old in how people use to live in buildings different to the year 2036, so how in 1936 would they have known that we would have this type of television in the 21st century, now that is something to think about and someone must have been able to realise that is how television would progress in the future.

The design of the film THINGS TO COME presented one of the greatest challenges, particularly the representation of the fabulous Everytown of the future. H.G. Wells approached legendary artist Fernand Lger, architect Le Corbusier and Bauhaus legend Lszl Moholy-Nagy before finally settling on in-house talent in the form of Vincent Korda and his own son Frank Wells. Some 90 seconds of Moholy-Nagy's apparently designs made the final cut, but he is not credited.

Because THINGS TO COME dares to attempt something that no film before and few films since have even tried: enormous in scope, it tries to encompass the whole of mankinds foreseeable future into a single comprehensible narrative. Its cast is literally every human being on earth. The only other sci-fi film I can think of those even attempts such a long view is 2001: A Space Odyssey. Besides that, the fil is often visually striking, and for a film from 1936 to appear visually stunning nowadays is quite an achievement. There are dozens of memorable images throughout the film which will be carried away by the viewer for a long time to come.

The THINGS TO COME film is certainly less glossy and shallow than much of Alexander Korda's output, but was not a great success, perhaps because the real threat of war was something people preferred not to be reminded of. Regardless, its relative failure probably confirmed Korda in his preference for lighter subjects. A second Alexander Korda/H.G. Wells association collaboration produced the film The Man Who Could Work Miracles [1937 which was directed by Lothar Mendes, and was notably more whimsical in tone.

Blu-ray Video Quality  THINGS TO COME Blu-ray is presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.33:1, encoded with a 1080p image transfer, courtesy of the British distributors Network. There are dramatic improvements in every single area we typically address in our reviews. Detail and especially clarity are very good. The daylight footage in particular often looks spectacular, especially the larger panoramic shots. The night-time footage also conveys surprisingly good depth. I was particularly impressed by the excellent balance between the greys and blacks and take a look at our screenshots and notice how the blacks and greys never overwhelm each other. Furthermore, there is a layer of fine and well resolved grain throughout the entire film. More importantly, however, there are no traces of problematic lab tinkering, because this Blu-ray release truly is a prime example of how when an older film is left to breathe the results are very impressive. Finally, occasionally there are tiny light vertical lines or very small scratches that pop up here and there, but it is quite obvious that enough was done to remove as many of them as possible without affecting the integrity of the film. A few minor transition issues are present as well, but again, considering the fact that different elements were used to assemble this version of the film; the final result is indeed enormously satisfying. Indeed, this is one truly fabulous restoration. Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  THINGS TO COME Blu-ray is presented with only one audio track on this Blu-ray disc 2.0 LPCM Mono Audio. Network has also provided optional yellow English SDH subtitles for the main feature. There are some minor fluctuations in the mid and high-frequencies, most likely inherited and impossible to fully address with current digital tools. Depth and crispness are not compromised, but occasionally the dialog is not well rounded. Generally speaking, Arthur Bliss' famous orchestral score is stable, though its dynamic intensity is quite limited. There is no heavy background hiss. All in all, the audio appears to have been optimized quite well, likely as best as possible.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

DISC ONE  BLU-RAY:

Audio Commentary: Commentary with Things to Come expert Nick Cooper: Here Nick Cooper welcomes us to his audio commentary on the 1936 film THINGS TO COME, and where he points out that the proper Title of the film is H.G. WELLS THINGS TO COME, which reflects H.G. Wells big influence and involvement in the film and his stature as a writer at the time the film was made. When we get to the start of the film where we get the wording Everytown appears, Nick points out that is obviously based on London. We get to see all the people walking about, but in the background we constantly get the warning that WAR is looming and at the time he wrote the novel, H.G. Wells thought that the 2nd World War will eventually happen. We find out from Nick that the original length of the cinema release in 1936, with the rough cut was supposed to be 130 minutes long, but the British Board of Censors in 1936 certified it for 117 minutes long, but for a long time there was only a print available in the UK that was just under 93 minutes, but with this Blu-ray release there are four reinstated scenes, which takes this USA release to just over 96 minutes. Essentially the film suffered from development nightmares, where H.G. Wells brought out a draft script that was totally impractible, so was made to produce a second screenplay that is what we view with this Blu-ray. The reason the film is much shorter, because it was felt that the 1936 film was very ground-breaking and the audience at the time would not of enjoyed the longer version, but in bringing this 1936 film to the screen it was felt that H.G. Wells was showing his belief that this is what would happen after a devastating war on the scale witness in the film and H.G. Wells also thought that society would organise itself in the way it is portrayed in the film. When we see the futuristic planes flying over Everytown there was an initial discussion on how the planes should be flown, especially whether they should have propellers, or should they be jet powered or even rocket power, but felt audiences would not accept advance driven aeroplanes, so decided to go with propellers. With the building of the New Everytown we get to see machinery working and the effects were very ground-breaking for audiences in 1936. When H.G. Wells wrote the screenplay for THINGS TO COME he was paid 10,000, which into days money it would be equivalent to  500,000, which was originally for a four film deal, for his collaboration, but in the end only two films were made and that was THINGS TO COME and The Man Who Could Work Miracles. Finally, we come to this audio commentary with Nick Cooper, which I fond rather dull, especially he is far too soft spoken and in the end I found it slightly boring and he tended to waffle a lot on stuff that did not interest me, I also had to crank the sound up, which didn't help my enjoyment of this audio commentary, but despite this, there were hints of interesting information of behind-the-scene information of the making of the film THINGS TO COME. But all in all it was okay, but when I view this Blu-ray again, I certainly will not be listening to this audio commentary.

Special Feature: Comprehensive Image Gallery [2012] [1080p] [17:22] Here we have a collection of 249 stunning rare black-and-white images courtesy of THINGS TO COME expert Nick Cooper.

Theatrical Trailer [1936] [480i] [1.33:1] [4:07] This is the USA re-release of the Original Theatrical Trailer for THINGS TO COME.

DISC TWO  DVD:

Special Feature: THINGS TO COME  Virtual Extended Edition [2012] [590i] [1.33:1] [94:00] Though this restored version of THINGS TO COME, presented on this DVD disc, is the longest-running print known to exist, compared to its original theatrical run-time that was significantly longer. Though this DVD version is now lost. Additionally, there were a number of scenes that were either filmed and not used or not filmed at all. This Virtual Extended Edition of THINGS TO COME, is an expansion of the print on this disc in such a way as to include cue-cards at various points detailing additional dialogue and scenes. This is not a Director's Cut of THINGS TO COME, or even an attempt to reconstruct the original theatrical version. A viewing option allowing for the inclusion of text and images from long-missing and un-filmed scenes to present a tantalising What If? in attempt to show what possibly could have been . . . But what I can say is that for this particular film version of THINGS TO COME, released on this DVD is truly excellent and stunning quality. But after viewing it, I can see why they released the shorter very 0f 96 minutes, as it tended to drag on far too long, and is very wordy, so I feel the shorter version is the best viewing experience.

Special Feature: Sir Ralph Richardson interview with Russell Harty [1975] [590i] [1.33:1] [41:02] Eccentric acting great, Sir Ralph Richardson, talks with host Russell Harty on the British talk show in London on the 26th September, 1975, Sir Ralph Richardson went on London Weekend Television and gave an interview with Russell Harty, which he gave his finest stage performances in this jolly romp of a TV special, and he sure showed that he was a freewheeling and free-associating, seeming artless in his candour, yet laying artful diversionary smoke screens whenever anything central to his privacy appeared to be threatened. We were watching a master mesmerist. We find out that when he was a young child he was always very seriously ill and hardly went to school, but when he did he hated it. At the time of this TV broadcast, Sir Ralph Richardson was appearing in a Harold Pinter play entitled No Mans Land at The National Theatre in London. Sir Ralph Richardson informs us that he is not happy with his looks and says, I have seen better looking hot cross buns. Russell Harty asks Sir Ralph Richardson about all the countries he has performed in and what ones were the happiest to perform in, and Sir Ralph Richardson says that he enjoyed working in Australia and found it very charming, he also enjoyed working in America several times, but would not like to live there, because he loves where he lives in London overlooking Regents Park. We find out that Sir Ralph Richardson admires Engineers, because they are able to build things and are very clever, he also admire Explorers as they will go to places deep underground that he would never ever dare to do so and finds them fascinating to talk to. As we get near to the end of the interview, Sir Ralph Richardson brings up a poem that Russell Harty quoted at Sir Ralph Richardsons home and was by John Keats entitled Ode to Autumn and happened to bring it with him and Sir Ralph Richardson decides to read the full poem in front of the audience, and was a fitting end to one of the most interesting and fascinating interview with this brilliant and eccentric acting great Sir Ralph Richardson.

Special Feature: On Reflection: Brian Aldiss on H.G. Wells [1971] [480i] [1.33:1] [23:36] This is a rare filmed documentary and was originally broadcast on ITV on the 28th February, 1971. Here we find Brian Aldiss outside the last house at Hanover Terrace that H.G. Wells lived in before he passed away, which is opposite Regents park in London. Brian Aldiss talks about when H.G. Wells was growing up as a young child and was very think and sickly child and was afflicted by Tuberculous. But over his many years when he started to become a writer of his novels, he was very prophetic in all of his novels, but was also a human dynamo, and a great ladies man, and the public put H.G. Wells on a pedestal in the same ways as Charles Dickens. Although H.G. Wells travelled all over the world, it was his London home that he preferred to be in and loved the best, but at the same time thought London was a complete muddle. H.G. Wells was born in London Borough of Bromley and his parents Sarah Neal and Joseph Wells. His father, Joseph, owned a shop but made more money coaching and playing professional cricket. After an injury prevented Joseph from playing cricket, Sarah, Herberts mother, worked as a maid and housekeeper. A working wife ended the familys claim to middle-class status. H.G. Wells made much of this, perhaps exaggerated, his familys struggles, and his characters often struggled with the conflicts of social respectability, personal satisfaction, and happiness. It is almost impossible to overstate the influence H.G. Wells had on the emerging field of science fiction. Trained in science and as a teacher, Wells was also intensely political: he was a socialist, a radical, and a supporter of a planned world state. In his fiction, Wells often combined his pedagogical tendencies with his political concerns, but that in no way affected the creativity and high literary value of his sci-fi writing. Among his genre-defining works are a time travel novel The Time Machine, a riveting classic about interplanetary warfare War of the Worlds, and some genuinely creepy novels exploring the social implications of scientific exploration The Invisible Man, The First Men On The Moon and The Island of Doctor Moreau. To earn a living, Wells began teaching. In 1886 he met his cousin Isabel Mary Wells, whom he was to marry in 1891. Wellss relations with women were always problematic. His libido was strong, and although short (around 5 feet 6 inches) and a bit pudgy later in life, his chestnut hair and blue eyes were striking. Women were attracted to him, but he found respectable behaviour difficult. Within one year of his marriage, he was enthralled by a student, Amy Catherine Robins. In 1895 his marriage ended in divorce, and he married Robins, whom he always called Jane. This marriage lasted until her death in 1927, but Wells had many affairs, most notably with Rebecca West, Moura Budberg, and Odette Keun. These relationships resulted in several illegitimate children. He frequently attacked restrictive sexual mores in his fiction. His novel Ann Veronica [1909], for example, was criticized because the heroine finds unwed bliss with her science teacher. The conventional view was that she should have suffered for such immoral behaviour. He addressed this theme repeatedly but perhaps most effectively in The Passionate Friends [1913]. Wells continued to teach and earned a bachelor of science from the University of London in 1890. He also wrote more and more, first stories and articles, then the Text-Book of Biology, which was published in 1893. Wells moved steadily toward being a full-time writer. With four books, 1895 proved to be the breakthrough year. Most important was The Time Machine, for its satiric treatment of human foibles viewed through the eyes of a traveller and the struggle between the Eloi and Morlocks found by the traveller in the future has also been portrayed as a socialist class struggle. Whatever its ideological focus, it was a good story that sold well and gave H.G. Wells and his new bride the beginnings of financial stability. Of the other books published in 1895, The Wonderful Visit, the tale of an angel that appears in a small English village, is the most well-known for its comments about hypocrisy and peoples failings. As we enter the 1930s, H.G. Wells becomes a big celebrity and met people like Franklin D. Roosevelt [32nd U.S.A President] in the White House, chatting with Vladimir Lenin, arguing with George Bernard Shaw and visiting the Kremlin in Russia to discuss the future with Joseph Stalin. In his later years, H.G. Wells found that he could bridge the gap from Victoria Society to the modern ideals, and was a total visionary, because he worked for the League of Nations Union that was an organization formed in October 1918 in the United Kingdom to promote international justice and human rights, which was finally adopted by the United nations after H.G. Wells passed away. If you want to find out why H.G. Wells was ahead of his time, one should read his novel Babes in the Darkling Wood: A Novel that was published in 1940. A very interesting fact we find out, is that H.G. Wells wrote over a 100 books, most have never been reprinted, he also did lots of activities to keep on the move, but the negative side of his character is that he was always borrowing money, which people seemed to oblige. Men and Women had a great love for H.G. Wells, far beyond his personal acquaintance and beyond normal readership., because they found him witty and honest, as well as an optimist. As we get near to the end of this fascinating insight into the world of H.G. Wells, Brian Aldiss sums up this prolific writer by saying, H.G. Wells died in 1946, just after the Atomic Bomb was dropped on japan, which was one of his prophecies, where the world is at the end of its tether, which he wrote in his last book. The end of everything we call life, is close at hand, and cannot be evaded. Well it was true for H.G. Wells, but not for the world, he has gone, but the rest of us are still muddling along.

Special Feature: The Wandering Sickness  Original 78rpm Recording [Audio only] [2012] [590i] [1.33:1] [4:18] This unique single-sided acetate gramophone disc, formerly in the collection of an ex-London Films employee, was used to record an extract from the novel The Shape of Things To Come, describing the symptoms of the ""Wandering Sickness,"" followed by a reading from the shooting script of the disease's first appearance in the film. The intended purpose of the recording in unknown, one possibility being that it was used to brief the numerous extras during filming scenes in the film. At the same time you get to view some black-and-white still images from the film THINGS TO COME. Unfortunately there is a lot of surface noise. This acetate 78rpm resides in the archive of Nick Cooper and is used here with his kind permission and assistance.

PLUS: A really nicely designed reversible Blu-ray Cover.

BONUS: Beautifully designed extensive 32 page booklet that has been expanded from the DVD by Nick Cooper entitled VIEWING NOTES, with the subtitled essay THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME. It also contains lots of rare sepia photographs from the film and a nice reproduction of the Cinema poster.

Finally, this is a tremendous release of William Cameron Menzies' THINGS TO COME [1936] by British distributors Network, and one that will definitely appear on my Top 10 list at the end of the year. Not only is the technical presentation very impressive, but the supplemental features are simply outstanding. Whatever one makes of the message here, the visual impact of the film is undeniable aided by a bombastic score from composer Arthur Bliss. The war scenes are suitably devastating, and the miniature work is effective and impressive given the resources of the time, while post-apocalyptic humanity struggles for survival amid artfully designed ruins. You have some really interesting and fascinating special features. In addition, there is the beautiful 32 page booklet with fantastic writings on the film. Highly Recommended!

929923,5,6304818254,Great movie,1455840000,,11,5.0
929924,3,6304818254,"This was a tremendously ambitious project. Once could say that it is three movies in one, but it is likely that at the time the connection between the then current world events needed to be tied to the visions of the future.

Nowadays one can make post apocalyptic, dystopian movies with no real explanation (see Mad Max II and beyond, movies which are indebted to the second segment) but at the time audiences might have needed an explanation on how the world got there. Thus we have to go thru the first segment, which today feels not so much like science fiction as simply a world at war movie. There are portions with vaguely futuristic vehicles, but they are no weirder than what vintage tanks and plans would look to modern eyes.

Welles obviously thought that another world war would last for decades, would exhaust resources and would plunge the world into a dark age. WWII happened, and this never quite happened. Yet his vision has remained influential as mentioned, to other dystopian film makers, but strangely enough to the current zombie film fad. How else to see the walking sickness victims, who walk around in a daze infecting others and need to be shot down by their neighbors as the only way to stop them?

The last portion of the film, while still relevant is the least effective one. On the one hand we still have social group opposing science and technology, political, religious and extreme groups deny basic scientific knowledge & the space exploration by NASA of the past is now for the most part dead;  but on the other hand scientists have demonstrated that they are just as human and fallible as any other group: Their judgment is no better (but also no worse), they'll sell out, wash their hands, be irresponsible, etc.

A system of checks and balances may not be perfect, but it is still bound to be more balanced than any sort of dictatorship or oligarchy, whether science based, beneficent and well intentioned or not.

Looks close enough and you will see wrist radios, large screen, high def TVs, Segways (two wheel scooters,) etc. The space gun (visual design) has been criticized in Science Fiction literature, but if you listen carefully to how it is supposed to work (it was meant to accelerate the spaceship by stages - not in  a single explosive blast - till it reached escape velocity,) maybe it was not quite as bad as the critics make it seem.

May seem slow and stodgy to the newcomer - a bad transfer and no subtitle option will not help, but watch that middle portion with Mad Max in mind and you will see that this a a film that remains full of still valid ideas.",1450137600,4,2609,4.607758620689655

930081,3,6304818254,"Firstly, if viewers of this film can hold on to the fact that it was made in 1936, then much negative commentary can be shunted aside as ""picky, picky.""  It simply is a tribute to the technical people involved in its production in what they were able to achieve back then.  Inventor Igor Sikorsky didn't fly his first experimental helicopter until 1939, yet--son of a gun--the chopper shown in the film is right on target, except for the steering yoke and no tail stabilizer.  The eight-engine aircraft appeared to be very much like the much later 1950's Northrup Corporation's ""Flying Wing.""  BBC was broadcasting TV in 1933 so its appearance on screen here is not too much of a surprise.  What is a surprise, though, is the desktop TV receiver and the wrist phone transmission in a quick scene.  Congratulations are also in order for the ""space gun"" launch setup which so very closely approximates what generations later appeared at Cape (Canaveral) Kennedy.  The scenic and technical directors involved in this production were amazingly on target, guesswork or no.  However, note must be given to the histrionic acting by all of the stars.  Most of the leading characters--Massey, Hardwicke, Richardson--were all products of the stage where large scale movements and posturing and dramatic, bellowing voices were needed and necessary during those days of no one being wired for sound.  Today it all seems ridiculous and unnecessary but in those days a film director would be hard pressed to ask the leading characters to ""tone it down a bit...""  In all, this pix is akin to a grand piece of antique furniture:  take it for what it is and for what it represents and you will have spent a worthwhile hour and a half.",1431993600,8,1717,4.822525597269625

930083,4,6304818254,"OK ""Things To Come"" gets 5 stars but I put 4 here for this presentation.  I appreciate it being available here, now I must tell you I have a VHS copy I took off TV 20 years ago which I enjoy more.  I'll have to update this review a bit later when I've had a chance to figure out why this new clearer more complete version doesn't really cut it for me like my old VHS version does, it may have something to do with screen size and aspect - things like that.  The following comments about the movie are based on my enjoyment of it over the years watching it on my old tape copy.

""Things To Come"" is an epic story practically novel length written by H.G. Wells, the famous writer who wrote many well known books including ""The Time Machine"".  I believe the movie did the writer a favor by helping to further popularize his very worthy science-fiction books, the movie has a requisite number of well articulated scenes that show the story's sweep of futuristic science-fiction history it seeks to show from the writer's more than a hundred years ago perspective and the movie maker's vision of it from their 1936 vantage.  I think, but I'm not sure because I'm not a movie historian, that the art design, old-time score, and acting are really good to excellent and give a good snapshot sense of what life was like in 1936, but maybe the movie originally could have used a few more takes so the editors could have made it flow a bit better.  But then again I'll need to update this review after I've watched this version again.",1429315200,,1523,4.379432624113475

930156,5,6304818254,"I'll forgo indulging in a preliminary narrative about my recent small obsession with this film, which I remember watching as a youngster on television many decades ago. It was a staple of late-night TV fare, offered up on some local horror/sci-fi program to viewers of 19-inch B&W sets with rabbit-ear antennas. Over the years I'd see stills from the film in books and magazines, and gazed with a mixture of puzzled fascination at the strange costumes and bold set designs.

I recently decided to check out You Tube to see if I could rekindle my fascination with the movie. Unfortunately, what I saw was pretty much what I'd expected, a smudgy, distorted thing that held little appeal. It only made me reflect rather sadly upon how the wonders of clear-eyed youth are invariably diminished when seen through the lenses of age.

However, in reading of the film's copyright history I took hope that perhaps there exists a version of the film that still has the power to awe and amaze, and that in my careless rush to see some version of the movie I'd simply stumbled across a poor copy. So, of course, I go to Amazon. As I'd hoped, there are multiple new releases of the film on the market. After streaming both the Motion Picture Archive as well as the Legend Films versions I still hadn't touched upon what I wanted. So I decided to commit myself to purchasing the version released by Criterion. I've seen several other classic movies released by the Criterion Collection, and I've found their restorations to be superior. I was fully satisfied with my decision. Not only does Criterion's release utilize the full-screen film ratio that modern viewers of wide-screen TV's are familiar with and used to, the video is crisp and the audio is free of the muffled distortion so trying on the ear.

I enjoy the simple artistry so evident in films of an earlier time. I've learned that often younger viewers are not quite so patient to take the time to savor the the more involved aspects of a motion picture. Don't get me wrong, I believe that films today are vastly superior to what's gone before, particularly in terms of acting, cinematography, and set design. But modern audiences have come to expect a degree of opulence and complexity only made possible through the liberal use of CGI. And many viewers are impatient with dialogue and mannerisms, seeking only a quick sequence of explosions and destructive noises from opening to easily identifiable resolution.

But as with all classic works of cinema this film is best enjoyed within the context of its own time. Many of the effects strike us as primitively quaint, and the film's vision of a postwar world we now know to be wholly wrongheaded. The viewer should remind himself that though he sees things as they have come to be, the film portrays a world of things to come. From the pathos of its opening scenes contrasting the merriment of the holiday season with the urgent warnings of impending war, through the chilling image of a dead body hanging on the wire deteriorating to grisly rags in the wind, through the gargantuan images of artistry and science, to Raymond Massey's concluding flight of rhetoric this is a film well worth the time to watch.",1425513600,6,3209,4.755834829443447

The movie is both timeless and relevant today, showing the utter insanity of war and of people who advocate war.
The utopia that can be achieve by man when he forbids war and instead worships science is a theme of the movie.

My favorite quote from ""Things to Come""
Raymond Passworthy: Is there never to be any rest?

Oswald Cabal: Rest enough for the individual man - too much, and too soon - and we call it death.
But for Man, no rest and no ending. He must go on, conquest beyond conquest. First this little planet with its winds and ways, and then all the laws of mind and matter that restrain him. Then the planets about him and at last out across immensity to the stars. And when he has conquered all the deeps of space and all the mysteries of time, still he will be beginning.

Raymond Passworthy: But... we're such little creatures. Poor humanity's so fragile, so weak. Little... little animals.

Oswald Cabal: Little animals. If we're no more than animals, we must snatch each little scrap of happiness and live and suffer and pass, mattering no more than all the other animals do or have done. Is it this? Or that?
All the universe? Or nothingness?

The US and much of the world has been at war  since the late 1930's, luckily for us, it has not been total inhalation of societies. (at least so far)

I found the whole space travel, moon launch prophecy interesting, but way off the mark on how it would be accomplished and WHEN.  They really thought it would be far off in their future.

There was an interesting discourse at the end between the artists/philosophers and scientists.  We are just now having some of the same discussions.  A good guess on future events.

Ive always been fascinated by what storytellers have been able to accomplish in cinema, and its even more captivating to see how the tricks of their trade have evolved over time.  In most respects, new technologies help to make stories more and more complex, but when you go back and take a peek at something like H.G. Wells THINGS TO COME one comes to realize that, largely, the technology has always been there.  Sure, it may be more refined, and there may be more ways to fool viewers; but effects have been a part of the motion picture since they began.  Perhaps theres no better proof of that that the final third of this highly regarded film.

(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then Id encourage you to skip down to the last two paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at things to come, then read on )

Over the course of a century, the residents of Everytown, U.S.A. experiences the highs and lows of civilization.  When a world war promises to wipe out an entire generation, their fair city is almost entirely reduced to rubble.  Decades later, a plague threatens to wipe out even more.  But in the distant future, the town elders will rise up with a message of hope for the future.  Will the people embrace their destiny once more, or will they bring the dreams for things to come crashing back to Earth?

Much ado has been made over the years about THINGS TO COME.  It was made possible only by very close collaboration between renowned science fiction writer H.G. Wells and the sharpest minds of a major motion picture studio.  Like Wells fiction, it grasps mostly at ideas that transcend the usual, trying to plot out the course mankind finds itself on while balancing the authors desire to make a statement about our world.  Having read a handful of his books, I can certainly see the masters mind at work  but  so far as this humble critic is concerned  thats as much a weakness as it is a strength.

Wells spent much of his writing trying to surround his fiction with internal discussions of culture, of war, of mans inability to see his own fallibility for what it is.  Progress never comes without consequence, and consequences are never explored without some even greater cost to the world-at-large.  As a result, some of his books can be slow-going, and this predilection for everything to have greater significance practically grinds THINGS TO COME to a halt.  Instead of allowing sequences to blend seamlessly one to the next, THINGS gets heavy-handed very quickly and never lets up, weighing down an already cumbersome narrative with endless montages which fundamentally keep making the same point: every step forward may invariably be two steps back.  Or three steps.  Maybe four.

Relying on too many didactic scenes, the film never legitimately posits any characters an audience can relate to other than perhaps maybe one simple trait.  When the people don't seem real  when they appear to be nothing more than constructs serving the plot  then the viewers are put in the untenable position of not investing any real emotion in their fates (individual or collective), and Ill admit that it wasn't until the films final section  Everytowns future  in which I felt some attachment.  Thats an awful long time to sit waiting for all of this to feel like it isn't preaching to me about mankinds arrogance, warning me against mankinds failure to rise above it all  sentiments most cynics like me already know before the lights dim.

However, THINGS TO COME remains a film thats definitely worth seeing.  Yes, it might be painful.  Yes, it might feel at times like a visit to the dentist.  But the films structure alone is admirable.  The artwork and art direction is phenomenal.  Go in realizing that this story is very slow paced, and youll probably enjoy it a bit more than I did.

THINGS TO COME (1936) is produced by London Film Productions.  DVD distribution for this release has been handled by the good people at the Criterion Collection.  As for the technical specifications, this film looks and sounds very solid with some interesting cinematography to help push the sluggish plot forward.  If its special features you're interested in, then this Criterion release is pretty special: theres an audio commentary from film historian David Kalat; an interview regarding the films design work; a visual essay on the films score; some unused special effects footage; an audio recording involving the wandering sickness (trust me, its in the film); and a terrific booklet with photos and an essay from Geoffrey OBrien.

(MILDLY) RECOMMENDED.  Others far more learned than I have said it before, but methinks it bears repeating: the only overwhelming reason to watch THINGS TO COME is to study the films art direction.  At 97 minutes, the first hour is a bit of a slog with several sequences going on vastly longer than they need to in order to make a relatively simple (if not predictable) point; and once the film progresses into the storys distant future its clear just how ambitious the costumers, set designers, craftspeople, and special effects folk had to work to bring this to life the way the way they did in 1936.  Otherwise, I just found so very little memorable from the entire experience.  A disappointment but visually interesting.",1396224000,4,5538,4.835281615302869

The story is allegorical, and thus many of the characters are obvious repeats of the same person throughout history; it's kind of fun to pick out the different characters through the makeup & costume changes. Coming from the pen of Wells, it's a story well-told. The only problems I have with the film are more the result of changes in society than with the film itself; there isn't a non-Caucasian face to be seen anywhere at any time; the taking of all natural resources from the earth without regard for any negative side-effects is treated as manifest destiny and (perhaps) the purpose of humankind; and that wonderful, perfect society the Engineers build at the end seems to be the kind of ""One World Government"" that has all the negative connotations attributed to the idea by the most vehement anti-governmnet survivalists of the present day.

My favorite is that Wells sees the World War lasting several decades, before finally being stopped by a somewhat fascistic group that subdues others with its (non-ironic) Gas of Peace. Yes, according to Wells, we'd be living like Mad Max by the 1970s, culture and technology having been put on all hold for all but a few blessed ones, who will rule over us as benevolent dictators.

It also amused me that the peaceful future envisioned is so banal as to be a kind of hell. Indeed, aren't utopias and dystopias the same thing?

Seeing photographs of all the imaginative sets and unusual aircraft from the film let my imagination run wild, and I couldn't wait for the day when I could actually see the movie!

930473,4,6304818254,"As a kid, I spent a lot of time watching Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers on the tiny black and white TV in our home.  I was also a big fan of H. G. Wells and his science fiction novels.  It is no surprise many of his stories have made their way to the big screen.  In this film, however, screenwriter Wells was instrumental in the development and final outcome.  Since Wells was no filmmaker, the results have both a positive and negative effect.  From what I gather, the final product was the result of compromising collaboration with producer Alexander Korda the final arbitrator.  Directed by William Cameron Menzies, the focus was more on the set and art design, for which he was more famous, than his working with actors.  This is one of the shortcomings of the film.  There is little character development or for the viewer's concern for their welfare.  Admittedly, with the film covering a 100 year period, there wasn't a lot of time.

The film opens on Christmas Eve, 1940 with the juxtaposition of joyous celebration in Everytown (obviously London) combined with ominous placards and signs warning of impending war.  Many don't believe war will come and want to enjoy the economic good times.  As deadly bombs rain down, we get a prescient look at the German bombing of London, 5 or 6 years in the distance.  Although I don't recall Germany being named in the film, there is no illusion as to who the filmmakers were talking about.  This war, however lasts decades.  The effects of the initial war thrust includes a pestilent disease known as the Wandering Sickness.  There is no cure other than death and many are executed to protect others.

The film moves ahead to 1966 and the world is in crumbles.  The remains of Everytown is subdivided into various fiefdoms, with The Boss (Ralph Richardson), aided by his wife Rowena (Margaretta Scott), running things.  When an unknown pilot of an airplane of advanced design lands, The Boss imprisons him.  It turns out it is Oswald Cabal (Raymond Massey), the grandson of John shown in the earlier scenes as a scientist/pilot hoping to secure peace.  Eventually Cabal and his now technologically advanced culture drop peace bombs on the populace, which puts them to sleep for a while before awakening to a new scientific movement.  The Boss doesn't make it and turns up dead.  He was fiddling with his pistol so I figure he committed suicide, otherwise why would he die?  It's never explained.

A few years go by and we begin to see the advances that science provides.  This section is perhaps the highlight of the film.  Wells' vision along with that of several artists of the day and some great set designs complimented by unusual miniatures are really mind boggling especially for 1936.  It is here as well that the wonderful soundtrack provided by Arthur Bliss really stands out.  In the concluding act, Cabal wants to take the next step by sending a pair of explorers, including his own daughter, up to the moon using the new Space Gun to get them there.  I suspect this caused some controversy at the time as the ""gun"" just recoils and then launches the capsule into the sky.  Again, I suspect this was Wells' idea and he ultimately won out.  Cabal's scientific advancement has tired the populace who just want to relax for a while.  Led by a sculptor named Theotocopulos (Cedric Hardwicke), a rebellion is formed to overthrow Cabal and destroy his Space Gun before the duo are launched.

Without question, ""Things To Come"" is a political message from the socialist leaning Wells.  The film labors with some of the extended dialog, mostly from The Boss and the Cabals (both generations).  Cabal in particular, preaches about the wonderment of science to the point of sensible elites (as Wells thought of himself I'm sure) running things to get to a Utopian world.  Certainly Wells believed that war was evil, beginning with John Cabal's early declaration that ""If we do not end war, war will end us.""  This is not a perfect film but is one of historical significance and one that I recommend.

Although the Criterion worked film is certainly watchable, there is no question the print used had more problems than could be corrected even with today's technology.  In some scenes there is flashing noted.  Otherwise I think the transfer is well done.  The film maintains its original 1.37:1 aspect ratio.  Here are the Criterion notes on the transfer:

""This new high-definition digital transfer was created on a Spirit 4K from a 35mm fine-grain composite print held by the British Film Institute. Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, and jitter were manually removed using MTI's DRS and Pixel Farm's PFClean, while Image Systems' Phoenix was used for small dirt, grain, and noise reduction.

However, even at only 97 minutes, portions of it seemed interminably dull. It's hard to enter into the lives of the characters--the good guys (both played by Raymond Massey, too often a stilted, affected actor) are too self-righteous and preachy. It's typical humanistic, futuristic wishful thinking--""In spite of the horrible circumstances we live in right now--in spite of the war and pestilence and inhumanity--mankind really is getting better and better, and someday we will bring Utopia here on earth!"" In other words, in spite of all the evidence to the contrary, mankind will bring in heaven on earth, and let's leave God out of the discussion, thank you very much!

Having said all that, though, let me add that as usual Criterion has done a great job with the presentation. A nice, crisp print of the film, beautiful packaging, a booklet containing an interesting essay about the film, great extras on the DVD. I love so many titles released by Criterion!

Barring the discovery of long lost footage, this is the version I've been waiting for.  Image resolution and audio are very good, far superior to the el cheapo copy I've lived with until now.  I'm especially pleased by the music, which comes through clearly.  The soundtrack is a classic in its own right, one of the all-time greats.  I have Bernard Hermann's selections on CD, but they don't quite suit me, and I want the complete score (I don't know enough about Gamba's recording, about which I've heard good things, but I gather it isn't entirely complete either), so until it turns up, I'll listen to the blu-ray.

He did this for several Dr. Mabuse movies (as well as writing the ultimate book on the subject), thereby adding immensely to the presentation.

930546,5,6304818254,"If you're someone who appreciates classic movies, then chances are you've been gnashing your teeth over the fact that such an important title like THINGS TO COME (London Films, 1936) hasn't been properly distributed on home video. Well, you can sigh with relief because Criterion's new Blu-ray release of H.G. Wells' prophetic, groundbreaking production is a joy to behold. Finally, the dazzling imagery of this film emerges from the fog of public domain dupiness.

THINGS TO COME was an ambitious undertaking at the time, not only in its subject matter - that of predicting 100 years into the future - but also in its cinematic creation. This was the first time that a noted author was directly involved in every aspect of adapting one of his novels for the screen. Wells collaborated closely with everyone; from producer Alexander Korda and director William Cameron Menzies, to set designer Vincent Korda and composer Arthur Bliss, to cinematographer Georges Perinal and special effects supervisor Ned Mann. While there were clashes over creative control, everyone's contribution remains intact making THINGS TO COME a testament to their considerable talent.

Although Wells was adamant toward having his film differ in every respect from Fritz Lang's futuristic epic METROPOLIS (UFA, 1927), similarities between both link them in the minds of many sci-fi aficionados. The scope of the sets, the archetypal characters, the idea of a utopian society, the masses ruled by an elitist class dedicated to technological advancement, the discontented mob rising against the elite - these are all common denominators in METROPOLIS and THINGS TO COME. There are significant differences too, in that Lang didn't make specific predictions whereas Wells accurately foretold another World War and a lunar expedition. In depicting the latter, Wells' scientific mechanics were off by using a ""space gun"" (Lang got the physics right in 1929 with UFA's WOMAN IN THE MOON), but this was a dramatic choice to show how a weapon of war could be used for a constructive purpose. It effectively brings the film full circle from the violent opening scenes of an aerial attack and anti-aircraft artillery to the hopeful space gun blast-off at the end. It also recalls the lunar launch from the very first sci-fi film, Georges Melies' A TRIP TO THE MOON (Star Films, 1902), in which the rocket is literally shot from a cannon.

There are those who find fault with the rather cold demeanor of several characters in THINGS TO COME, but I disagree; Technological advancement has its obvious advantages, but I could see how its side effect could be a decline in emotional interaction. Indeed, there's already some indication of this in our current tech-obsessed, insatiable society. I like how the characters stand for certain types, symbols if you will, rather than individual personalities. THINGS TO COME is a broad, visionary tale with a message, not a character study.

The visual design, even today, is stunning, and when combined with that terrific music, it all produces a unique and memorable film experience. It anticipates by thirty-two years ""things to come"" with Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (MGM, 1968).

Criterion's disc is off a 35mm fine-grain composite print and looks/sounds fantastic. For a movie whose effect depends so much on how well its design comes across, this Blu-ray of THINGS TO COME is the last word in quality. Special features include an intelligent and informative commentary by David Kalat, an interview on the film's design by Christopher Freyling, a visual essay on Arthur Bliss's score by Bruce Eder, unused effects footage by artist Laszlo Moholy-Nagy, a 1936 audio reading about the Wandering Sickness, and an illustrated booklet with an essay by Geoffrey O'Brien.

My highest recommendation.",1371859200,32,3815,5.2052117263843645
930547,5,6304818254,"This review is of the June 2013 Criterion Blu-ray, compared with the 2001 Image Entertainment DVD.

Briefly, this 1936 film presents a future history from 1936 to 2036. It begins with the outbreak of a decades-long world war which leaves civilization devastated - with isolated pockets of people slipping back to pre-industrialization as things simply wear out and are not replaced. For example, a rattletrap Rolls-Royce being pulled by horses and a doctor emptying his last bottle of iodine. A small-time warlord, the Boss, tries to make war on neighboring warlords with worn out equipment. The Boss, and his like, are ""cleaned up"" by a powerful league of scientists and engineers who have built a technological society - and enforce their vision of the ideal state with sleek airplanes and ""the gas of peace"". All this culminates in a gleaming world of peace and harmony.

The film has been given the usual fine restoration by Criterion, and is much improved over the 2001 DVD. The image is in fine shape with only occasional brief sections that are slightly soft looking. There is little new material, however. According to my player the 2001 DVD is just under 93 minutes, and this Blu-ray is just over 97, so there is only about 4 minutes of new material. There is a new scene of a victory banquet, a few other scenes are slightly longer, but the banquet is the only new scene I noticed.

If you are a serious film collector you will want this restored Blu-ray; it is much better looking than the DVD. This was truly a landmark film - probably the last big-budget science fiction film until ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", in 1968.",1371859200,2,1628,4.745583038869258

930610,5,6304818254,"NOTE: THIS REVIEW APPLIES TO THE CRITERION COLLECTION DVD OF THINGS TO COME, ISSUED IN JUNE OF 2013.
Let me start by saying, purely in the interest of disclosure, that I made a small contribution to part of this release, in the form of an account of the music from the film -- but I had no role in any other aspect of the release, and have no participation in the sales or other activities surrounding the Criterion Collection DVD (or ANY other DVD edition) of this movie, nor did I have anything to do with the elements of the release about which I'm about to comment.

That said, I can safely say that the picture and sound quality of the movie itself as presented on this DVD (the FIRST authorized video release of the movie, at least on this side of the Atlantic, incidentally, and taken from the BFI's restored edition) are both stunning -- I'm old enough, and was lucky enough to have seen THINGS TO COME long before the wave of degraded, faded, worn out, and chopped up editions of the movie began filling the airwaves in the 1980s, at a time when there were still authorized 35mm prints of the movie around; and this release is a match for those 35mm sources and THEN some, for sheer quality in the detail, contrast, and richness, of the picture and the sound. It's the best the picture has looked and sounded in my experience since I first saw it in 1969, and it's better than that presentation (which was on a proper, network owned-and-operated TV station, incidentally -- on Christmas Day, no less, maybe because of the film's opening sequence?), as well.

As to the running time, it's 97 minutes -- that IS the running time of the movie, period. THINGS TO COME was previewed at 117 minutes (and perhaps even a longer version at one point), and subsequently cut down several times before its actual general release at 97 minutes, and was later cut to 92 and then 89 minutes; but 97 minutes is what there is of the movie. Unlike, say, Fritz Lang's METROPOLIS (1927), which was actually released in Germany (albeit briefly) at its full, 153 minute running time before being cut -- and which had full-length prints sent to distributors in various markets on different continents -- THINGS TO COME only ever went out at 97 minutes into general release, so there aren't any ""loose"" or unaccounted for long prints of it to be found around the world (as, fortunately, there were with METROPOLIS).  There do exist stills representing scenes and characters that were cut from the film before release, and an ""alternate cut"" of the movie, incorporating those stills and other visual elements to fill out the ""lost"" sections in tandem with surviving script portions representing the deleted scenes, has been done for release in the UK; but there is no actual 117 minute, or 107-minute, or 100-whatever minute version of the movie, or whatever the frequently-cited figure is for an ""extended"" cut of the movie, to be seen intact as a finished, complete film. (That's anymore than there will ever -- EVER -- be an official ""extended"" cut of 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, incorporating the scenes [was it 16 minutes' worth?] that Stanley Kubrick edited out after the previews but before the actual opening of the movie, in the basement of the MGM building on Sixth Avenue in New York. Reviews of the film from the opening even cited the still-visible splices at that point; and that removed footage is gone forever). And anyone who wants to rectify that situation on THINGS TO COME would have to take a page out of one of Mr. Wells's other playbooks, and perfect a time machine, journey back to London in 1936, and persuade Alexander Korda to save the deleted portions of the movie (good luck with that . . . . though if one could do such a thing for this sort of purpose, I'd sooner do it for the lost reels of Erich Von Stroheim's GREED and Orson Welles's THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS, ahead of THINGS TO COME . . . . )

I'll also add, equally important to anything else about this release is David Kalat's audio commentary for the movie on the Criterion DVD -- it is a wonder: Charming, witty, informative, and entertaining, and this comment comes from someone who has done about 30 audio commentaries in his time.

As to the movie itself, it's even more fascinating than it looks and sounds, if that's possible to say (how can a movie be more fascinating than it looks or sounds? read on . . . .) -- a ground-breaking social/science-fiction film of its time, purporting to deal with the next 100 years of human history starting with the Second World War (the start of which it only gets wrong by about 15 months) and its aftermath. THINGS TO COME is, in many ways, akin to Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, a later monumental look into the future, and the relationships of humankind to technology, and technology to power (questions also raised by Lang's METROPOLIS, which Wells thought a very silly movie). And THINGS TO COME shares many characteristics with Kubrick's movie, including a coldness that repelled a lot of audience members in 1936, and characters who are mostly more symbolic figures than dramatic creations). And the whole thing was initally conceived by H. G. Wells as a near-operatic creation, with the music giving the work its structure, shape, and texture (and the music still mostly does, even though it wasn't shot that way except for the building-of-the-new-world sequences in the last third of the movie).

In other words, yes, it's all well worth buying.",1370304000,51,5470,4.674974039460021

Will mankind ever learn to live in peace or are we destined to destroy ourselves watch this movie as you are about to see ""THINGS TO COME.""

For those people that actually have read HG Wells you will find that this film is not too far left field from his original thoughts. Much of HG Wells' works shows that he has some sort of a techno-fascist who believes that scientists and engineers were designed to rule the world. Raymond Massey who makes great speeches; you might remember him from Ayn Rand's the Fountainhead. In this film he states ""and now for the rule of the air man and a new life for mankind.""

The original movie version has over 30 minutes of never before released film.  There first is news and then there isn't.  The British version (not available in the U.S.) is 12 minutes longer and then there is still more footage waiting to be discovered.

In the meantime, there has been repackaging, colorizing and now with the Criterion ""version"", commentaries (very much welcomed) but it could be thought of as ""filler"" while we wait for the remaining footage.

Films such as ""Metropolis"", ""The Quiet Man"" and ""Lost Horizon"" have each in their own way, been treated with some lack of respect until someone FINALLY decided to REALLY put in the time and effort to restore those films as they should be.

It really becomes topical in most years as it seems that humanity is becoming advanced yet war and constant threats to destroy others and themselves bring yet again the animal out on us.

Considering this was made only three years before the second world war, its premise that another war would be the same as the first world war of attrition that would drag on forever as the first world war had seemed to do and leave such a large hole in the populous that it would change humanity forever.

That technology would forever create more ways to kill effectively and horrendously that it would become a two tier world of the haves who cling together and the have not's who don't even know of their existence.

It's old, it's black and white, some of the acting is hokey to say the least but like metropolis, it's the word and feeling it brings over, the subtext that brings life to H G wells classic.

He is one of the masters of science fiction with his war of the worlds, invisible man, time machine, the island of Dr Moreau, etc.

This is filmed in the line of the early Flash Gordon films but like the early invisible man you have to look beyond the filed SFX and to the real storyline.

930680,4,6304818254,"Things to Come; written by H.G. Wells; directed by William Cameron Menzies; starring Raymond Massey (John Cabal/Oswald Cabal), Edward Chapman (Passworthy/Passworthy) and Ralph Richardson (The Boss) (1936): Things to Come gives us 100 years of extrapolated human history in about 100 minutes. That doesn't leave a lot of room for characterization, but characterization isn't on Wells's mind anyway -- or at least not the characterization of individuals, as humanity is the evolving character in the bildungsroman presented here.

We follow humanity's rocky road by watching the history of Everytown (pretty obviously London, England), beginning on the eve of a world war in 1936 and ending with humanity's first baby steps into outer space in 2036. In between, we get vignettes of diasaster and rebuilding, and one long middle section setting the hyper-civilized, transnational Airmen against the tribal warriors of bombed-out Everytown, led by Ralph Richardson's engaging barbarian Boss, the only character in the movie I could imagine not punching in the face as soon as I met him. And he's the bad guy!

The visual effects are occasionally stunning -- moreso given the technology of the time. One's reactions to Wells's utopia, built by scientists and engineers who love lengthy declamatory speeches and airplanes with giant wings, will vary depending on one's own opinions about 'human nature', the perfectability of man, and the wisdom of wearing togas and capes all the time. Why did seemingly everyone in the 1920's and 1930's think the citizens of future utopias would wear capes and dress all in white? Recommended.",1326585600,,1623,5.3359375
930681,4,6304818254,"H. G. Wells (1866-1946) was one of those outstanding personalities that emerge every so often that set him apart from the rest of us mere mortal human beings. He was not merely the greatest science fiction writer of his time (The Time Machine, The Invisible Man, The War of the Worlds, The Island of Dr. Moreau), or perhaps all time, he also wrote about history (The Outline of History), politics (Ann Veronica) and class struggles (The Sleeper Awakes, The Time Machine) and developed the first war game (Little Wars).

Wells had a long standing interest in predicting the future, and his very first best seller in 1901 (An Experiment in Prophecy) was an attempt to describe the world in 2000 where he correctly predicted the decline of Germany, the rise of cars, the growth of suburbs, and the sexual revolution. In 1914 (The World Set Free) he anticipated the atomic bomb.

The current film was based on Well's 1933 novel ""The Shape of Things to Come"" and Wells himself adapted the book for the film.

It stars Raymond Massey (1896-1983) who is best remembered for his roles as Lincoln - ""Abe Lincoln in Illinois"" (1940), ""The Day Lincoln was Shot"" (1950), and ""How the West Was Won"" (1962). Prior to playing Lincoln, most of his roles were villainous (e.g., Philip of Spain in ""Fire Over England"", Black Michael in ""The Prisoner of Zenda"", Prince Ghul in ""The Drum""). On TV he played Dr. Gillespie in the series ""Dr Kildare"" (1961-5). He made nearly 100 films and I never saw a bad performance.

Alexander Korda (1893-1956) produced nearly 60 films in his career that started in 1923 in Hungary. His break through film was ""The Private Life of Henry VIII"" (1933) and there followed a series of historical dramas including ""Rise of Catherine the Great"" (1934), ""Private Life of Don Juan"" (1934), ""The Scarlet Pimpernel"" (1934) and ""Rembrandt"" (1936). Korda was known for his cheap production values, which are evident in this film, sometimes laughably so.

William Cameron Menzies (1896-1957) directed this film, but is better known for his art direction for which he won 2 Oscars - ""The Dove"" (1927), ""Tempest"" (1928) - and was nominated for 3 more. In 1940 he received a special Oscar for his color work on ""GWTW"" (1939). This was his seventh of 20 films he directed, the most notable of which were ""The Thief of Bagdad"" (1940) and ""Duel in the Sun"" (1946).

Menzies was a great fan of German director Fritz Lang, and one can see the influences of Lang's Metropolis"" (1927) in many of the sequences in this film.

So what does he get right in his predictions for the next 100 years?

* A World War (he predicted it would start in 1940)
* Massive bombings and near total destruction of cities
* Mobile phones
* TV (including big screen TV)
* Holographic communication
* Trips to outer space
* World wide plagues
* A worldwide organization trying to keep the peace

But not all of these predictions are necessarily worthy of praise. The world wide plague had already occurred in 1918 and previously; The League of Nations had already been created (although it failed); World War 1 was already in the bag, etc.

And what does he miss?

* The computer revolution
* The shortness of the World War and the quick comeback
* The extensive use of automobiles

Bottom line - an interesting film and a look at the mind of one of the great writers and thinkers of the 20th Century.",1326240000,,3373,4.669477234401349
930682,5,6304818254,"This film isn't for everyone.  For example, people who believe that Sarah Palin or Rick Perry would make good presidents should pass it by.  Ditto for those who think that Obama is a Muslim, or that anyone who dies without converting to Christianity goes to Hell.  By the same token, if you're a fan of reality shows like ""The Kardashians,"" then you might as well pass it up.  So should those who think that zombie movies are good science fiction.

In short: stupid, shallow persons will not appreciate it.  That's because it foretells a world where stupidity simply has no place.  If you're familiar with the brilliant film ""Idiocracy,"" then imagine the exact opposite of the world it portrays.

""Things to Come"" tells the story of a world that might very well have come to pass, had Hitler chosen to use his stores of chemical weapons during WW2.  In the first half, civilization is devastated by a conflict between nations, in which poison gas is used as sort of a low-tech version of the atomic bomb.

In the second, the world is rebuilt by a coalition of rational thinkers led by the central character, an engineer and aviator named John Cabel, who saw from the story's beginning how war would destroy humanity if it wasn't forever banned.

Keep in mind that this film was made in the 1930s, so don't expect fancy CGI effects.  The special effects are crude by modern standards, though not bad at all by the standards of the time.  The strong point of the movie is its plot, and even more importantly the way it correctly identifies the cause of war and mass suffering, as well as their solution.  The character known as Rudolph, or the Boss, exemplifies every hyper-patriotic, anti-intellectual, intolerant, war-loving brute that has ever walked the earth.  He hates science, loves the past, and sees the world as an extension of his own ego.

Think of Napoleon, Mussolini, Saddam Hussein, Glenn Beck, CEOs of corporations driven to bankruptcy, etc.: men that had great potential, but chose to squander their gifts in search of personal glory.

John Cabel, conversely, says it all when he proclaims that he represents law, sanity, and common sense.  He is a vision of what humanity may become: clear-minded, rational, and concerned with the common good. He and his allies enforce a global peace, turn the resources of science and industry towards purely peaceful ends, and transform the planet into a near-paradise.  Illness and poverty are banished, and individuals are free to pursue their own intellectual or artistic endeavors.

At the end, however, ignorance and fanaticism rear their ugly heads once again. There's a climactic conflict between those guided by Reason and tolerance and an irrational, violent mob, made up of the kind of people one might expect to watch Fox News.

I got a real chuckle out of some of the one star reviews.  Especially amusing were those who called Cabel's character and beliefs fascist.  These people should really learn the definitions of words before they use them.  The movie is stridently anti-fascist.  In the future world, everyone is free to speak as they will, even when it threatens the governing authorities and the burgeoning space program they have launched.

It's only when the enemies of Reason turn violent that the authorities act, and then they do so in a surprisingly gentle fashion.  Cabel's world offers to hysterical fanatics something they would surely deny him: peace, safety and freedom.

If you've seen ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" from the 1950s (another outstanding movie) then think of Cabel as being a home-grown version of Klaatu, a bit more benevolent but also a tad more stern.

For instance in the opening credits, you can actually see the clouds behind the opening credits.

930734,3,6304818254,"Calling the acting stiff would be an understatement, and no one in the movie ever says anything - everyone declaims, and in bold, often stentorian tones. Every point made in the movie is made with the subtlety of a jackhammer. To modern ears the result is vaguely ridiculous, and sometimes irritating.

Like everyone else in his era, Wells was a great deal too optimistic about the Wonders of Science (the capitals are essential). But the movie made a lot of good points and Wells clearly made a handful of good guesses. He foresaw European war (even if he clearly had no idea what the battle lines would be drawn over), and anticipated germ warfare, non-lethal crowd control, and the general ""scaling up"" of science. Even where he was wrong (his ideas on spaceflight were unworkable, his apparently fond hopes for an uprising of scientists and engineers unlikely) the guesses were interesting. (Whoever it was that dreamed up the movie's clothing fashions for the far future era, though, was out to lunch.)

I can't imagine the impact that would have had on a 30's audience. It was probably little short of mind blowing. Watching it with that in mind makes it worthwhile. And some of the sets were fascinating, providing eye candy for when when the actors aren't quite holding up their end. If you like sci-fi at all, worth a rental.",1244764800,5,1334,4.770562770562771

930739,3,6304818254,"First of all, I just wish to clear the air for those fans who may be sitting on the edge wondering if they should buy another poor copy of THINGS TO COME, a wonderful but extremely dated film. This DVD transfer is about the best I have watched since I started collecting copies of this old movie.

All my prior VHS and DVD copies were made from terribly degraded originals and could barely be watched without feeling like you weren't forcing the situation. This DVD is far from perfect, but may possibly represent the best they can now do, and is worth the price in any case. I really don't know the business of digital enhancement, however, I suspect a more meticulous job of making the transfer might improve the DVD only slightly, after all these years of wear and tear on the film.

Viewers interested in the preservation of the original B&W film will be happy to read that an enhanced B&W copy has been included on the DVD. As a test, you might wish to turn down the color setting to ""zero"" and screen the color version in B&W and see if you can tell the difference between the two.

For the record, when I first saw this movie as a child I was mesmerized by the story and its message and would have given the film five stars. Now, with more mature taste for sci-fi and after the jading of senior citizenship, I would only rate it at three stars. By today's standards the script (which sounds very idealistic and elitist) could use some major rewriting. Also, this film's special effects would benefit immensely from today's precision modeling and CGI effects. Then again, it would no longer be the THINGS TO COME we all love.

I must confess, I have never read the HG Well's book to compare the script to, and it may also contain narratives I consider ""elitist"". This is especially true when an alliance of engineers, technicians and aviators believe their skills and common sense can be used to govern the world. I only believed in technocracy when I was a small child.

If I may just comment on the special effects used to represent the march of technology and creation of a new age; this series of images was very impressive in the early 50's when I first watched it.  It is interesting to see how a socialistic-technocracy could lead to the same Earth raping that we now credit only capitalism with. It was, however, nice to watch the unbridled march of technology without a green peace movement.  Oh yes, they did have that anti-technology movement at the end of the film when their spokesman said attempting to stop the first lunar flight, ""We shall hate you more if you succeed than if you fail"".  I bet NASA can relate to that statement which predicted that no good accomplishment will go unpunished.

It is also amazing to me how the imagined technologies of the future shown by this film were outstripped by actual inventions and innovations in (at least) the following fields: aviation, space, medicine, manufacturing, mining, tunneling, electronics, computers, the world wide web, communications, TV, radio, and robotics (not to mention nano-technology).  We now watch more impressive real world machines on nightly news and TV episodes of Modern Marvels.

I no longer understand what Raymond Massey was raving about during the last two minutes of the film. Somehow his words drove me to tears when I was a boy of about eight, back when I thought I understood what he was gibbering about.",1213660800,6,3406,4.650582362728786

930742,4,6304818254,"H.G. Wells in 1936 was past his prime and the books of his that will survive were long gone by. He was coming to the end of his life and he was confronted to his dream gone sour. At the very beginning of the 20th century he defended the idea that the world was doomed because the evolution of species, natural biology, on one side, and Marxism, market economy on the other side, were necessarily leading to the victory of the weaker over the stronger due to the simple criterion of number.

The weaker were the mass of humanity and the stronger were the minority elite. He defended then a strict eugenic policy with the elimination of all those who were in a way or another weakening the human race. First of all the non-Caucasian, with the only exception of the Jews who would disappear thanks to mixed marriages.

Then, within the Caucasian community all those who were not healthy, the alcoholics, the mentally disabled, all those who were genetically disabled, etc. That was not Hitler. That was H.G. Wells and that was not after the first world war. That was more than ten years before. And twenty years before the first world war he had published The Time Machine that defended the idea that the human ""race"", left to its own means and due to the vaster cosmological evolution of life on earth, would see the differentiation of the human ""race"" into two ""species"": the working class would become a subterranean laborious species and the bourgeoisie would become an idle surface species.

The point was in the novel that the surface sophisticated and weak idle species was the prey of the other species who were the predators. Wells was convinced humanity was in danger and politicians were supposed to stop this evolution by imposing a strict eugenic policy. The first countries to follow this injunction were the Scandinavian countries who were also the last to drop it only very recently for some of them. The film here proposes a vision of 2036 with a world government that is absolutely dictatorial in the fact that there is no election, no parliament, no really democratic institution, only peace imposed by military conquest, and the government is dominated by one man or at the most one man and his few councilors.

And in that future world all, absolutely all human beings are Caucasians. Wells was able to imagine humanity being completely white by 2036. Amazing. Wells envisaged some kind of a rebellion but that would be short lived and lead to nothing at all. The last sentences are the vision of this white civilization conquering the whole universe when contemplating the sky and its stars and planets. Frightening. And that was produced in 1936. All the more frightening since nowhere the slightest mention of Hitlerism, fascism, Japanese imperialism or Stalinism can be found.

But it is essential to have that film in a good restored edition because it is crucial to have a full vision of H.G. Wells. We are obviously very far away from the Brave New World of absolute ""democratic"" social selection, or the Animal Farm of the dictatorship of the porcine proletariat, or the 1984 of the abstract mediatic dictatorship of Big Brother. This vision is at least just as much frightening as the three others. And I only want to compare Wells with the British science fiction writers of his days. It would be unfair to go beyond. This reveals that in England in these first three decades of the 20th century there was a tremendous fear among intellectuals: the fear that the future would only be somber, bleak and in the form of an impasse of some kind.

I agree its no Star Wars but nearly everything in Star Wars, right down to the type disappearing in the distance, is lifted from Things To Come, Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers.  Things To Come is long and dated but even with the sound off, its worth seeing for the set design.

This colorized version is fun but no Criterion edition.  In fact, the amount of ""restoration"" appears to be around 0%.  There is no mention of licensing as there is on the Image DVD, so I presume they got a free, public domain copy and ran it through their computer.

There is a short segment with some lofty talk about how realistic colorization has become.  While that is (obviously) false, there  is something about this movie that lends itself to the ""hand tinted"" look of colorization.  There are vivid blue skies, pale brown and pale blue clothes and copper skin tones.  And a bit of black and white they just skipped, I guess.  Nothing terribly realistic but still,  very pretty!

Two things worth mentioning .  They managed to pull a little more out of the shadows than on the Image DVD so the early night scenes are easier to see.  And there are some vintage, 1950s space toy ads, also very-unrestored, that are fun.

So the best version is still from Image but if you're a big enough fan, you might want this one as well.  Of course, avoid anything from Madacy as nothing from them is any good.  I have to wonder what Things To Come would look like if Kino Video gave it the restoration they gave Metropolis....

I'd give it another star if they were honest about what they had and had not done.

The colorizing, directed by filmmaker and animator Ray Harryhausen, is well worth seeing. A nice special feature includes an interview with Harryhausen and the colorizing process--it has come a long way since the 1980s. Please note that director William Cameron Menzies dreamed about making the film in color; based on notes and period materials, the film, in a strange way, realizes the director's 1930s pre-color dreams. It is a film that imagines life in the late 1900s and early 2000s. While it has a naive pacifist  ""anti=war"" theme and prefigures the dangerous modern left-wing dreams of America and Europe, it is at its heart anithetical to traditional American ideals of individual freedom and republicanism. Wells was, in the end, a misguided man who believed in outmoded ideas such as world government or United Nations-type institutions such as the League of Nations; incredible to think people still advocate for world government believing, like children, that it could come close to solving genuine problems and stop war. Wells never conceived of today's Third-World thug leaders hiding under the skirt of the toothless United Nations.

WELLS:THINGS TO COME"" (Released: March 31, 1936) (92 mins) (Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) --- now in COLOR and Glorious Black and White --- Things to Come is a 1936 British science fiction film, produced by Alexander Korda and directed by William Cameron Menzies. The screenplay was written by H. G. Wells and is a loose adaptation of his own 1933 novel The Shape of Things to Come and his 1931 non-fiction work, The Work, Wealth and Happiness of Mankind. The film stars Raymond Massey --- The film, written throughout 1934, is notable for predicting World War II, being only 16 months off by having it start on 23 December 1940, rather than 1 September 1939. Its graphic depiction of strategic bombing in the scenes in which Everytown is flattened by air attack and society collapses into barbarism, echo pre-war concerns about the threat of the bomber and the apocalyptic pronouncements of air power prophets. Wells was an air power prophet of sorts, having described aerial warfare in Anticipations (1901) and The War in the Air (1908).(From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

The Shape of Things to Come is a look into the future from the perspective of the people of 1936 --- the film relates to what could have been a real possibility, shows the horrors of war and the price of progress looking at a world on the brink of World War II --- what the world would be like if a major war broke out --- an early attempt of a science fiction film that takes a long hard look into the future.

930790,4,6304818254,"This film is basically divided into three parts. The present (circa early 40's wartime Britain)...the foreseeable future (the '60s) and the ""distant future"" (mid 2001st c). The murkiest section, both in terms of plot, acting, cinematography, is the first third. Pretty mundane, war is bad, humanity is lame sort of deal. The film quality for some reason looks washy and badly filmed. Don't know if it's the quality of the print or of the original camera work, but it hasn't worn well.

The second part is saved by an over the top performance from one of my favorite actors of Brit stage and Cinema, Sir Ralph Richardson. He plays the Banana Republic, fascist ""fearless leader"" to the hilt and back. The cinematography is also a bit better, and in retrospect, maybe that's what the director intended. As time progresses, the film quality does as well, though given that logic, ""civilization"" actually regresses after all the years of warfare, so the film quality might have too.

At any rate, the main reason to purchase this film is for the final third, the futuristic, early '40's Art Deco vision of the future.

The sets are truly mind boggling. I don't know what sort of budget Korda & co had, but they spent every pence of it in constructing these wonderfully inventive, wonderfully detailed models. In an era before CGI, this has to be the state of the art in terms of set design. Truly incredible!

Some camp value in terms of the short tunics the men wear in futureland. Couldn't conceal a smirk or two in seeing those.

The ending is pretty corny, but still endearing. Raymond Massey was a great enough actor to pull it off. Definitely worth owning and the DVD quality is excellent (given the caveat about the first part, which I gather was intentional).

Oh, and a note about the colorization. I generally hate it. Who wants to see The Maltese Falcon in color, for Turner's sake? But it works very well here and Harry Harryhausen oversaw it, so you know it can't be half baked. Again, as with other technical aspects, the colorization is pretty murky in the early parts, but works fantastically in futureland. It's definitely a plus, rather than an artisitc hindrance, in this instance.

My one regret is getting to be 40 years old before seeing this movie.  I love old Sci-Fi movies, mostly of the late 1950s genre.  I was very impressed by the special effects, considering the year the movie was released.  I was also impressed by the art direction, including the camera angles used.  The war scenes at the beginning of the movie were surprisingly brutal.  As for some aspects of the movie being too dated as some reviewers reported, one of the things I find fascinating about older Sci-Fi movies and stories are the descrepancies between what is written and what actually comes to pass.  This movie was more about making statements about society than showcasing special effects, but the special effects were great.

(The colorized version of SHE put out on the same label is much more impressive.) It has that rather pastel look reminiscent of the early days of  the process. The ""restored"" black and white version, also included on this disc, is also a disappointment. Although not as bad as many of the public domain DVDs out there, it pales in comparison to the Image DVD, which still remains the benchmark at this time. Besides the slightly dupey look, the beginning of the opening credits is clipped, and the climactic last chord of music at the film's finale is missing.  Most importantly, the film runs 92 minutes, NOT the 100 minutes promised on the DVD case.

While on this subject, does anyone know if there's a reason why longer versions of this film have never appeared on video (at least not to my knowledge)?  I saw a print on Chicago television in the 1980s which included at least two scenes I've never seen in any other print. One of them was a victory banquet at which The Boss gives an impassioned speech to his chiefs and commanders. The other was a short scene near the beginning of the film, in which Passworthy speaks out about vengance upon whomever started the war.",1164844800,12,1295,4.641921397379913

The war scenes, some of them footage of real military equipment and others very cool looking models, seem very realistic.  In the end, H.G. Wells's other book, The Shape Of Things To Come, is brought into the movie.  The book is about the wonderful, bright, future and the film shows a future where airmen have joined together in their wish to bring peace to the world, using science and bravery, by overthrowing the old ways and the old world.  In the end mankind takes the first steps to the stars.

The second movie is called Journey To The Center Of Time.  The idea is that scientists are trying to find a way to peek into the past or the future.  But an accident breaks the lab away from the present, tossing it into the river of time and space, first far into the future and then back into the past.  There seem to be some complaints that dinosaurs did not exist one million years BC but nobody says the giant lizard is a dinosaur.  It fact it could be a giant Komodo Dragon.

OK, maybe I am being silly, but outside of the somewhat bad science, the movie isn't that bad.  It isn't great but it isn't that bad.  I remember seeing a part of it as a kid and being impressed that the bad guy ended up killing himself.

On the other hand I am not too impressed by the new lab coming out of no where.  Maybe the movie producers wrote themselves into a corner and they had to find a way out?

930841,4,6304818254,"Unforunately, you're not likely to find stunning the look of the DVD or VHS transfers. Image Entertainment's DVD is the only one approaching watchable quality. I first saw the film on TV in the 1950s and remember finding it remarkable, so decent prints must have survived at least until then.

That Things to Come was a financial disaster upon its release is irrelevant to its achievement (although central to the failure to preserve its original negatives). It's a visual feast, created with the help of meticulously detailed miniatures, superimposition, rear projection, and dynamic camera movement.

Dated, shmated. It's a story, not history. The acting is, as in a fable, magnificently over the top. Raymond Massey, Ralph Richardson, and Cedric Hardwicke are perfect. And dozens of its indelible images remain with me fifty years after I first saw it.

A bonus is one of the finest film scores ever written, by Arthur Bliss. A shame the sound quality also suffers on these prints. The full power of the score can be heard separately on a number of modern CDs.

Approach the poor prints of this movie as you might an early operatic recording, say of Caruso. The quality comes through despite the limitation of the medium. And one day, who knows, maybe someone will find a pristine print and present this great film as it deserves.

UPDATE NOVEMBER 2013

I watched the film recently after not seeing it for a long time and felt compelled to downgrade it from five to four stars.

It's magnificent filmmaking.

But the preachy script and hammy acting are downright embarrassing. And although I love Arthur Bliss's music on a separate recording of the suite, its use in the film is almost unbearably heavy handed. And that chorus at the end singing ""which will it be"" is, well, excruciating.

H. G. Wells was an amazingly prescient man. He predicted the start of World War II with great accuracy. And having the first moon mission be a circling of it rather than a landing was also on the mark. Of course, Wells could not have known that the moon would be reached not in 2036, but in 1959, and circled (by Russia) in 1966.

But shooting a missile at the moon with a cannon? Come on. Wells had to have known better. A moon cannon reminds one of Jules Verne and goes at least as far back as Cyrano de Bergerac. Robert H. Goddard published his first papers on using rocketry to reach outer space in 1919, and by the time this film was made he had been experimenting with rockets for ten years.

But I suppose that the use of a moon cannon was undoubtedly more dramatic than a rocket, especially with the incredibly exciting scenes of the crowd rushing to try to destroy it before it can be fired.

I still love the film, being thrilled by its action and visuals ...  while cringing at the dialogue and acting.",1145491200,13,2806,4.65587044534413

930884,5,6304818254,"If you are a special effects buff as I am and love looking at the kind of art that was produced long before today's ""sterile"" and extremely boring digital age, this film will not disappoint. In fact, I would venture to say that the visuals hold up rather well considering where the technology was at the time, some of the techniques used in a few shots still look practically flawless even comparing to today's technology. Other production values were first rate as well and that's what earns the film it's five stars.

As far as the story goes though, it's extremely dated, therefore it is necessary to transport yourself back in time and place yourself in the mind-set of the apocalyptic types who predicted utter doom and gloom as envisioned before WW2 to continue on for more than a century, as that is the point of view the story is told from, which today of course renders it completely meaningless. The work of pure fiction is very clearly told from the point of view of the Neville Chamberlain appeasement mentality and, given the time it was produced, was very obviously anti-Churchill. Even though the film was British in origin and is nearly seventy years old, the similar beliefs of today's anti-war Hollywood left predominate throughout. The actual outcome of WW2 and the next half century though is what mostly dates this film's storyline into utter irrelevancy.

Make of the story as you will, but the film is pure art at it's best and should be thought of as no more than that. Nothing else about it is timeless.",1122854400,4,1528,4.697761194029851
930885,3,6304818254,"William Cameron Menzies' ambitious British sci-fi ""Things to Come"" is impressive when one considers its 1936 release.  A skinny legged and sometimes toga clad Raymond Massey stars as both Oswald and John Cabal who are grandson and grandfather.

The movie commences on Christmas 1940.  The world is on the threshhold of war.  Hostilities begin and the war machines are mobilized.  Massey plays an airforce pilot.  Both sides are using chemical warfare, dumping lethal gas bombs on each other.  The war drags on and leads to a deadly plaque known as 'wandering sickness"" which decimates half the worlds population.  After 30 years of continual warfare most of Europe has fallen into anarchies governed by local warlords.

Elsewhere a society of airmen known as Wings Over the World has evolved separately.  They have perfected flight and created the gas of peace which they use to finally end the war.

The flick jumps to 2036 where a futuristic society has been created which is now experimenting in space travel.  This society lead by Massey, now playing the grandson has its troubles as well.  An unruly group lead by Cedric Hardwicke, sickened by mankind's too rapid progress threatens to destroy a ""space gun"", which will propel a rocket to the moon.

Viewing this flick almost 70 years after it's release was a revelation into the expansive mind of H.G. Wells.  The movie, however is reminiscent of the ancient Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers serials in their authencity.",1113264000,6,1472,5.0
930886,5,6304818254,"Things to Come is an unusual film with an unusual history.  It plays on several levels, the most important being its anti-war message.  H.G. Wells, from whose book The Shape of Things to Come this film was adapted, was a man deeply opposed to war.  As the twentieth century progressed, Wells worried greatly about the future of man and society; he studied the past, publishing the impressive nonfiction book The Outline of History, and he began imagining the future - as it might be and how he might like it to be.  His embrace of science remained true, but it was a more tenuous embrace, one espousing both fear and hope.  Things to Come, released in 1936, takes up these ideas - some of them, anyway, as some of the more controversial aspects of the novel The Shape of Things to Come were ignored in the emphasis on the horrors of war.

The movie opens on a Christmas night in 1940; the residents of Everytown argue the possibility of war among themselves, only to have the holy night shattered by a bombing attack on the town.  The world quickly descends into major warfare, and we are treated to a number of images of the spreading conflict.  The war is made to look as frightening as possible, featuring frightened masses, decimated buildings, and the curse of gas warfare.  Then the movie shifts to the year 1970.  Three decades of constant warfare have brought civilization to its knees, and the Wandering Sickness has wiped out half of the human population.  Local warlords rule their own little fiefdoms, and the Chief we are introduced to is still dangling the prospects of peace in order to sell continued warfare.  The weapons of mass destruction are in short supply now; his only mechanic has been unable to repair the few remaining airplanes, and there is no petrol for them even if they could get airborne.  Into this backwards world of modern barbarians comes John Cabal - arriving in a modern airplane, of all things.  Cabal represents Wings Over the World, a new society made up of airmen and scientists committed to remolding the world (and social order) and eliminating war.  The Chief, naturally, rejects Cabal's overtures, refusing to give up his hard-won authority and martial aspirations.  Cabal's friends soon come to rescue him, flying in on a fleet of impressive airplanes armed with ""the gas of peace.""

The final third of the movie takes place in the year 2030.  John Cabal and his scientists succeeded in their mission to reshape human society under their influence.  The futuristic city is impressive - immaculate, gleaming white, and technologically rich.  Cabal's ancestor now holds the position of authority, and he is totally committed to a new course of space exploration.  The ""Big Gun"" is built and ready to send two intrepid young explorers around the moon.  You might expect the citizens to be shining, happy people - but they're not.  One man in particular, an artist named Theotocopoulos, leads a reactionary people's revolt against the follies of ""progress.""  He says the time has come to rest on society's laurels, not waste the people's money and energy on frivolous projects such as the Big Gun.  Suddenly, it's a race against time to fire the Big Gun before it is destroyed.  The drama draws a sharp line between the two choices for the future.  Cabal actually comes across here as slightly mad in his final ""Which will it be?"" moral speech, daring to dream of conquering the entire universe in the name of science, resulting in a sense of ambivalence toward science I found a little confusing.

The filmmakers had no fear of melodrama, as several scenes essentially drip with sappiness.  The dialogue is somewhat stilted, as the important characters, particularly the Cabals, give speeches rather than merely speak.  As for the look and special effects of the film, we're talking about some amazing stuff for the year 1936 - the film company spent a bundle on this film, and it shows.  The scenes of warfare are particularly impressive -so impressive and disturbing that the movie-going public did not really warm up to the film - after all, the horrors of war were still rather fresh on their minds.  As things turned out, Things to Come would play better to future generations than to its contemporaneous one.  What does the film's lack of success in 1936 mean to you, the viewer?  More than you might think.  The film was not preserved the way it might have been, and the prints that fell into the public domain were of disappointing quality.  I can't speak to the merit of this DVD, but I can say the print of the film I saw was exceedingly dark, making much of the first third of the movie very difficult to see.

This film is a true time capsule, though, and it works much better than most ""prophetic"" movies of its kind.  Much of the acting and dialogue appears quite dated, but the themes of this movie are eternal - in fact, they are probably more important and applicable now than they have ever been.  Its endorsement of a one-world government will not go over well in many places (especially my house, as the very idea is anathema to me), and I find its rejection of warfare quite nave (especially in the world of today), but this is a very important, instructive look at man and society (as well as an underappreciated masterpiece of science fiction).",1094688000,21,5312,4.732608695652174
930887,4,6304818254,"Okay, enough already about the transfers, let's talk about the film itself.
In a nutshell, this 1936 Brit sci-fi feature deals with war and progress. Everytown (London?) is shown in 1940 about to celebrate Christmas amidst blaring headlines of war (in a nifty bit of symbolism, the children play with war toys around the Christmas tree). Then war hits the city (in an eerily accurate foretelling of the German blitz that DID rock England in 1940). As time goes on, the war drags into decades ending up in a post-apocalyptic society in 1966.
Because of the war, Everytown/London has regressed into a crude, medieval  type society without electricity which wastes its resources on senseless wars and is led by a Hitler-type warlord ogre called ""The Boss."" The world is also famished by a deadly, incurable disease called ""Wandering Sickenss"" whose victims are shot by the boss (reminds you of Castro's quarantine of AIDS patients).  John Cabal (Raymond Massey) is a leader of scientists who return to civilize Everytown/London and establish a scientific technocracy. But the Boss demands the technology to wage more war, which he tells his followers is necessary for the peace (he begins to sound frighteningly like George Bush Jr. during such  speeches). Anyway, the Boss and Cabal face off, and I'll leave the rest to your imagination. A moon shot and some anti-progress protesters (simialr to today's anti WTO protesters) play major parts in the latter third of the story.
For those of us who are into history, this film is extremely eerie, yet fascinating and worthwhile to watch. It's scary in that some of what H.G. Wells prophesized did indeed come true in ways that are even more so than what I just mentioned. (Think of some of today's so-called Third World countries whose resources are wasted by boss-like dictators among other things). Basically, this film, despite the overtly speechike dialogue (Raymond Massey's soliloquy about the need for progress near the film's end is a bit hard to take), is an eloquent sermon on the hindrance that war makes on the progress of humanity and the need for education to triumph over ignorance. It would be great for a high school or college history teacher to show and have a discussion with their classes about this film.",1085443200,4,2271,4.955380577427822
930888,4,6304818254,"This movie, made between the two World Wars, preserves a complex and varied view of its time. The movie opens on a holiday, with family scenes, caroling, and the rest. The background, however, is a constant threat of war, blared from the news media. In an uncomfortable foreshadowing of 1984, the aggressor is never identified clearly, even when the bombs start to fall.
The next scenes were, I'm sure, as horrific a the director could make them, within the standards of the time. The city, the families in it, and the civilization that it stood for were bombed to the ground and the wreckage gassed. This must have had a special horror at the time. WW-I was still strong in living memory, and the veterans crippled by gas were still alive. But this movie's war went on for decades, long after were no more weapons left to fight it with.
The post-war population was slashed by plague - again, something vivid to people who still remembered the deadly Spanish Flu. Society collapsed into village-states, each governed by the biggest bully around.
New hope for the world came from pure technological optimism, the belief that scientists and engineers could create a moral society in their Buck Rogers laboratories and factories. Don't get me wrong - it is not possible to create a humane society without the labs and factories. We now know that it takes a lot more, as well. The arrogance, techno-tyrrany, and 'weapons of peace' in that new order seemed natural, even proper in that era. They chill a modern viewer, since we now know that a lab coat isn't a mantle of moral authority. That technological utopia was not perfect. It carried its own inherent vices, the easy life and the sense of entitlement to every comfort imaginable.
This movie is a time capsule. It recorded the beliefs and hopes of its age, and plays them back for us 60+ years later. I am boggled by what was then the most advanced thinking; it now seems so naive. We've had a chance to the predictions that came true (mostly, the negative ones) and the predictions that failed miserably in practice (most of the positive ones).
The science fiction aspects of this film will seem hopelessly dated to today's effects-junkies. Even the style of acting will seem stilted. No matter, this one is worth watching and re-watching.

930935,3,6304818254,"Let me preface this review by letting you know my frame of reference. I am reviewing Things to Come as a film, a historical visual doccument and a DVD
Things To Come has excellent set design, they evoke images that still ring strong. It's depiction of civilization and near feudalism due to constant war and attrition of resources creates a dramatic contrast when the future's 'Everytown' goes from a metropois to a shelled city, to a home for tinhorn dictators.
The second section of the film, the rebuilding and absortion of civillization into the world of science and progress is fun to watch, the sets hold up well today, even the rounded look a airplanes and society.
I also need to preface this review by saying I liked looking at the film but at times gritted my teeth at the dialog. It was the 1930's so I can forgive some overacting and mugging as it was the tradition of it's time, but the endless preaching of science as the savior of mankind and the 'c' word, civillization gets old fast. Worse, the film and dialog seemingly contradict themselves. Science is the only hope for humanity yet it is pondered if things haven't progressed too far.
Think of the film as a bell curve. The action builds, meets it's climax halfway through the film and starts to lose steam. The future city looks great but there's very little that clues us in on society other than H.G. Well's rants about a science based socialist state compared to a dictatiorship.
If you like the politics you might enjoy the dialog. I could have accepted the themes if they would have been backed up by actions. It's a film, not the short story.
The transfer to DVD is poor. If this is the film to buy I can only shudder to think what a bad version is like. There are many segments where the picture literally sparkles unintentionally. The print quality may be acceptable in terms of saving what is left of it to archive but many of it's problems could have been fixed with no continuity changes. The sound is terrible as well, at times distorted but comprehendable. Again, this could have been fixed rather easily if someone warranted the restoration.
Perhaps because Things To Come is difficult for several reasons it is not deemed worth quality commercial treatment. As a result your stereo (if you use one) will sound like the worlds largest $0.50 speaker.
To sum:
Hisorical importance: 5
The film itself: 3
Transfer to DVD: 1
Get it if you want to see some fightenly close to reality scenes of war and destruction or the fine art deco tinged future. There's projections or holograms predicted, and not to far from our possible future, Metropolis influenced buildings that look like late 80's malls. :) Things to Come is visually pleasing as long as you can get past the film transfer.

930936,1,6304818254,"This double feature by (shudder) Madacy contains two amazingly poor looking films: ""Things to Come"" and ""Journey to the Center of Time.""

""Journey to the Center of Time"" is a terrible, lifeless, shamefully low budget film in which almost nothing happens.

930937,4,6304818254,"Image Entertainment's DVD edition of H.G. Wells ""Things To Come"" is a welcome improvement over other home video editions.  The package and marketing information state that this edition features ""a new video transfer from original source materials"", and so it evidently does.  Yet, these words could be misleading.  Image may have obtained the use of an authorized ""original"" studio print for this edition, and I appreciate their doing so, but this does not look like an ""original"" print in the usual sense.

In 1935 & '36 London Pictures spent a fortune to make ""Things To Come"".  The movie is a sober warning of the horrors and retrograde effects of war on society.  At the time of its appearance, the world still suffered under the brutal memories of the World War that ended in 1918, and at the time of the film's release, with rumblings of the rising Nazi war machine in Europe, the public was in no mood to be reminded of war's frightful prospect.  Audiences shunned ""Things To Come"" in droves.  The studio never came close to recovering the costs of the picture, and ended up abandoning it.  The rights eventually fell into the public domain, and there it has languished, with numerous opportunists making duplicate prints from the existing original 16mm prints.  These shoddily made prints were transfered to tape,  and cheaply copied to VHS tapes that are unviewable as anything other than a poor suggestion of the film's original glory.

By abandoning the film, the studio didn't bother to preserve the negatives, and the scarce original release prints made in the 30's and the hundreds of unauthorized duplications are all that remain.  Since most studio films are shot in 35mm,  a 35mm print would be the closest descendent from the camera negative, and the best existing source from which to make a new negative, or a video transfer. Since most 35mm prints are destroyed when a film is withdrawn from theatrical distribution, very few, if any 35mm prints of ""Things To Come"" have survived to our time.  It is therefore not surprising that Image Entertainment's video transfer is not from an original 35mm print.  Indeed, strictly speaking, it isn't really from an original 16mm print, either.

If you duplicate an old photograph without first shooting a negative from the photo, the final printed duplicate will not look much like the original photo: it will lack contrast and range of gray scale.  Yet, that is how most 16mm ""duped"" movie prints are made.  Printing of movies is very expensive, and shooting an intermediate negative doubles the expense if only a single positive duplication is made.  What's more, 16mm offers a very tiny frame from which to shoot a negative.  An intermediate negative shot from a 16mm print would perhaps produce better contrast and range of gray tone, but because it is an added step in the duplication process, it  further diminishes the final image resolution and adds more distortion and noise in the optical sound track.

The source elements for this DVD edition are not your typical ""duped"" 16mm print.  They appear to be printed from a negative generated by reduction from a 35mm POSITIVE print.  It also appears that exposure correction may have been applied to various scenes during the printing process.  This then is probably a studio duplicate using a 16mm duped reduction inter-negative, resulting in a 16mm print with fine contrast and gray tones, while still exhibiting good image resolution and sound.  The sound for this negative may have been electro-optically transfered, thus reducing the distortion and noise contributed by optics-only duplication, and nearly matches the sound quality of a true original 16mm print.  The sound is so primitive however, that it is hard to be certain.  Nevertheless, the dialog comes through nearly as well as from original 16mm studio prints of other titles from this period. The music, however, is a bit distorted and shrill at times.

Having gone to the trouble to make a 16mm reduction inter-negative, it is surprising that the 35mm source print for it wasn't first cleaned up.  There are emulsion lines, and a lot of dirt that could have been removed fairly economically.  My guess is that the inter-negative was made long ago, before methods for line removal had been developed and before the film was felt important enough for such maintenance.  Nevertheless, the results, while hardly gorgeous, are the best I've seen of this title, and the DVD should bear up well to repeated or extended viewing.

I find Daniel P. B. Smith's comments (elsewhere on this page) telling.  I quote:  ""In the late sixties, I saw a clean print of this movie in a New York theatre and it blew me away.  ...it is visually spectacular....

Just because such a 35mm print was still extant in the 60's is no proof that such a print still exists more than 30 years later, although it seems likely.  It is lamentable that the film has not been digitized, and so  preserved for all time, using original 35mm elements.  This is a visually ground-breaking film which continues to impress viewers as well as influence film makers, and it will no doubt continue to do so; but  unless a collector comes forward with an original 35mm print for high resolution digital transfer, future generations may be consigned to view it thru a glass, darkly.  But, at least with this DVD, the glass is now significantly less dark.  Thank you Image Entertainment for taking pains to obtain this print.",1044316800,36,5579,4.907150480256137
930938,4,6304818254,"""Things to Come"" is really of much more interest as prediction and propaganda than as performance and plot.  The 1936 film is based on H.G. Wells' ""The Shape of Things to Come,"" which certainly goes as far as any of his works in talking about what the future would look like because of the advancements of science.  However, this is also Wells at his most pessimistic, as he predicts a global war made more horrific by new weapons.  It is interesting to look at this film and see the strong anti-war stance that it takes, remembering where England and the rest of Europe stood at that time, on the brink of World War II.  Certainly the depiction of the coming war, as Everytown (a.k.a. London) is destroyed by air raids, would be proven realistic within a few years.
""Things to Come"" is very much of a paradox for viewers.  On the one hand the production designed by director William Cameron Menzies (best known for his work on ""Gone With the Wind"") is superb, using art deco to represent the progress of the future; a visual counterpart to ""Metropolis"" to my mind.  Menzies even shows himself a student of Eisenstein with his use of montage, especially during the opening sequence and the air raids on Everytown.  But the film leaves you curiously cold.  The overall effect is not so much wonderment (cf. Dorothy opening the door in Oz, which alone blows away this entire film), as it is the conviction that you are looking at a clinical portrait of the future.  The performance of Raymond Massey as John/Oswald Cabal is key because you almost always get the feeling he is lecturing not acting because he is not so much a character in the movie as he is the Basil Exposition of his day.
Furthermore, the movie clearly falls into two halves: the first dealing with how humanity rebuilds itself and the second generations later with a backlash rising up against the launching of a ship to the moon.  The problem is that the two halves fit together awkwardly.  The rhetorical messages end up being embrace technology as a means to peace for the first half and do not turn upon the technology you have embraced as a means to peace in the second half.  You would think that the first lesson there would be the point and that the second would be a bit premature at that point in time.  Certainly you have to see ""Things to Come"" once in your life if you are a student of science fiction films, but prepare yourself for the same ambivalent feelings that so many of us are expressing here.",1035417600,3,2482,4.538116591928251
930939,3,6304818254,"By 1936, Europe was aflame with the fear that a war was coming. Most Westerners suspected this, but few knew what to do about it. Hitler had been making land-grabbing noises for the last few years, and it became pretty apparent that whatever optimism the West once had for peace was to flicker out soon enough. It was against this background of the failure of faith that director William Cameron Menzies called on H. G. Wells to write the screenplay for his novel THE SHAPE OF THINGS TO COME. It was not a hit, either with the critics or the paying public. It was only after the reality of the war that soon followed that caused viewers to re-evaluate a film that just a few years before had seemed laughably implausible.
 THINGS TO COME is a movie in three parts. Raymond Massey, who plays three generations of one man, is the thematic glue that binds the disparate strands. In the first part, Menzies is quite prophetic as he pictures Everytown (read London) getting ready for a new form of war in 1940. Massey plays John Cabal, who discusses with friends the blessings of a new technology that soon may be blighted by war. This war comes, and Everytown is quickly reduced to a confusing melange of swirling dust and collapsed buildings. Panic and death permeate the screen. The first part concludes with a montage of events, each portrayed by the continuing collapse of humanity with the passing years flashing onscreen. Death, disaster, and pestilence are of Biblical proportions. In fact, this part eerily foretells a similar Fall of Civilization in THE ROAD WARRIOR. The second part begins in 1970. The war is over, and England has been reduced to a feudal state with local warlords using a horse and buggy technology to maintain power. One such leader is the Chief, played by Sir Ralph Richardson, whose booming voice matches his robust physique. Right in the middle of the Chief's war against the Hill people (a name later picked up by Steven Vincent Benet in his similar short story 'By the Waters of Babylon'), a propellor driven aeroplane lands, piloted by a descendant of John Cabal, who immediately announces that all such feudal warlords will be replaced by an elite coalition of scientist-philosopher rulers called Wings Over the World. Naturally, the Chief objects, but he and his primitive thugs are soon routed by the Peace Gas. Sanity returns to humanity. However, this sanity is the sanity of Plato's REPUBLIC, a system of government in which the individual is repressed by exactly the same type of elite rulers as Wings Over the World. Wells and Menzies went too far to hammer home this point. For the last ten minutes of part two, the viewer is bored to distraction with innumerable scenes of machines digging, plowing, building, all of which suggest that man can be bettered by the wise use of technology. This focus on the struggle between the individual and the state forms the dramatic center of part three. Here, the latest descendant of John Cabal extols the latest symbol of man's search for better living through science, a monstrously huge Space Gun that will shoot a manned projectile to the moon. As Cabal discusses the success of the Space Gun, a friend objects with: 'Is there never to be an age of happiness? Is there never to be any rest?' Cabal responds, 'Rest enough for the individual man. Too much of it too soon, and we call it death.' The movie ends with Cabal's warning to the audience of 1936: 'All the universe--or nothingness? Which shall it be?'
 THINGS TO COME is a movie of flawed power. The scenes of western civilization crumbling are gripping. The images of what a power-hungry leader like the Chief could do are stern reminders to all audiences of all ages that power is a vacuum that can be filled by the brutal despotism of one like the Chief or by the more benevolent despotism of Those Who Think They Know Better how to rule. Menzies' choice is a bleak one. It would do well for a viewer to remind himself that perhaps a third alternative is possible, one that still has a place for the individual not to get lost in the glitter of advancing technology.",1024531200,7,4111,4.7004160887656035
930940,4,6304818254,"Before post-apocolyptic war movies became common and overdone, Things to Come was a stunning cinematic masterpiece that had breath-taking special effects for the 1930's.
A technique using mirrors at different angles to project the actor's image onto a miniature model, the sets for the future are quite impressive.  The special effects really are great.  The montages of the advanced technology in the future, and the scene of thousands of people swarming around the rocket are mind boggling when you think about the year this movie was done.
Raymond Massey is excellent, as always.  If you don't want to watch it for the special effects, just watch it for him.  This is a must for a Raymond Massey fan.",1017187200,,703,4.932203389830509
930941,5,6304818254,"UPDATE: These first notes refer specifically to the Criterion Collection DVD Edition, Spine #660.

I'm not a cineaste or a film historian, just someone who saw the movie in a theatre in the 1960s and wanted to see it again. I am pleased to say that FINALLY we have a DVD edition that has good picture quality, worthy of the phrase ""restored."" I submitted negative reviews of two earlier DVDs that look like they were made from bad 16mm prints: contrasty, grainy, blurry, and flickery. The best way I can describe this one is to say that it is good enough--it recaptures my memory of the theatre experience. Obviously Criterion did some hard work, and obviously they must have had to piece together footage from different sources. It's very noticeable, for example, that all scene transitions retain the ""grainy old 16mm look"" for several seconds. Even the ""good"" parts look grainy in freeze-frame; I don't own a BluRay player but I suspect that BluRay wouldn't be much better.

But it's good enough. Some of the most memorable sequences, notably the flight of the ""Basra bombers"" and the ""Building of the New City"" sequence, now have the visual power I remember.

The good image brings out everything, including the movie's many flaws. It also reveals a lot of variation in the quality of the special effects. Many of which are really darn good, while others--the aircraft and spacecraft in particular--look like they are made of plywood.

It's a pity that the sound isn't better, but I don't remember the sound as being very good in 1960, either. This was optical sound of the 1930s and it's the way I remember optical sound as being. Not hi-fi. According to the commentary this movie was a pioneer in the use of dense, symphonic music. There are excellent modern recordings of the suite, and if you see this movie you owe it to yourself to listen to a modern recording, and I'll go so far as to recommend ""The Film Music of Sir Arthur Bliss"" on Chandos; search for ""B00005A8EF"" on Amazon.

I found the audio commentary by David Kalat to be excellent, witty, and informative, but I was disappointed that it wasn't really a scene-by-scene description and that nothing on the disk gives any details of just how the special effects were done.

To call the film ""preachy"" doesn't begin to describe it! Like 2001, the visual aspects carry the film, but the characters and dialog are awful. And I just can't believe the premise of the Theotocopoulos character being opposed to ""Progress"" itself, and the idea of a grand opposition between those who favor it and those who want mankind to ""rest"" and stop exploring. Just possibly there may really have been something of that feeling in England in the 1930s (G. K. Chesterton?), the humanists versus the British Interplanetary Society and so forth. But among the many big predictive ""misses"" in the movie, the contrast between the public attitude toward spaceflight in the movie, and in historic reality must be one of the biggest.

Anyway, I can recommend the Criterion Collection edition. It is a decent approximation to the way I remember the movie looking, I have finally gotten my chance ""to see the film again,"" and in my personal opinion it is well worth watching.

NOTES ON EARLIER VERSIONS
NOTE: Unfortunately, I think the new colorized Harryhausen version has the same problems. See more below.

""Things to Come"" was the ""2001"" of its day.

In the late sixties, I saw a clean print of this movie in a New York theatre and it blew me away. Although it is in black-and-white, it is visually spectacular; the story is exciting; and it has a wonderful score. The sound was mono optical sound, but it was crisp and clear and capable of delivering the impact of the Arthur Bliss music.

For years, I've owned a disappointing VHS copy, which looks as if it were made made from a dirty, blurry, over-contrasty 16mm print, and the sound quality is poor. I've yearned to see a clean copy.

So when I got my DVD player, one of the first things I did was to buy this release, which says that it ""features a pristine new film-to-video transfer from original source materials.""

I am sorry to say it looks EXACTLY like the cruddy old VHS version, and the mushy sound is completely unworthy of the composer and music director.

So, I don't know what to say. If you've never seen the movie _Things to Come_, I recommend the movie highly. But the image quality and sound on this DVD have, alas, that ""lousy old 16mm print look.""

UPDATE: I'm afraid I think the ""Harryhausen"" colorized version is just as bad. My remarks above were written about an earlier DVD, Alas, and to my great disappointment, apart from being colorized, I'm afraid that they do. My review was for an earlier DVD edition.

I had great hopes for this new release with the Harryhausen name, and I'm aware that apparently other reviewers' opinions differ from mine. I think they must never have a 35mm print of this film, though.

Black-and-white films from the late thirties are technically every bit as good as ""Casablanca"" or ""Citizen Kane."" This DVD still looks to me like a bad 16mm print. I'm not a purist, but the film grain is coarse and obvious. The framing is not steady. The exposure varies, giving an irregular flickery effect. It's not exactly blurry, but it's not as crisp and sharp as any ordinary DVD of any ordinary 1950 black-and-white movie. Comparing it to the earlier DVD, I'm not sure what ""restoration"" was done except for colorization.

I'm glad that people find this version enjoyable to watch, but _Things to Come_ is a minor landmark in cinema history, and a major landmark in science fiction cinema history. Like 2001, this film was a visual spectacle and low picture quality greatly reduces its impact. It deserves better than this.",1012608000,172,5766,4.7260956175298805
930942,4,6304818254,"&#8220;Things To Come&#8221; is one of those intelligent sci-fi films that you dream about.  It is an adaptation of H. G. Wells book of the same name.  Filmed in 1936, it traces the history of a (fictitious) world war that begins in 1940, and is continually fought until the 1970's.  The film show life before the war, life during the apocalypse, and finally traces world society into 2036, with a planned space mission, and a group of futuristic luddites who are opposed to the plan.
The sets and cinematography is pure eye-candy, and remind me of a rough Fritz Lang, and life during the apocalyptic war has become chilling, considering the possibilities that may happen in this war on terrorism.
It is an anti-war film.  However, Wells naively thinks that scientific endeavor can save humanity.  Contrast this with the idiotic statements that we got when the genome was cracked:
&#8220;Perhaps most surprising, two analyses released this month suggest that the entire human genome may contain fewer than 40,000 genes - about half the number that scientists have presumed (no more than a worm and a fly combined, Collins quips).&#8221;
Would you want scientist Collins, who can't see the difference between a fly, a worm, and a human, to operate on you?  And we are to build humanity on this foundation?  Science had given us many trinkets, but she has failed to give us any meaning&#8212;due to the Naturalistic Fallacy.  How do you get from &#8220;E=mc2&#8221; to &#8220;Love your neighbor?&#8221;  The scientific endeavor, therefore, would just be a type of busy-work.
The copy is very rough and blurry at times, and the dialogue fades in an out, and the DVD has no frills that we love and use.  But this rough copy is better than no copy at all!  This is a perfect classic, and a must for an sci-fi junkie.
&#8220;Journey to the Center of Time&#8221; is bad.  But I think it should be mandatory viewing for people who think that Star Trek: The Original Series was bad, since &#8220;Center of Time&#8221; makes Kirk look like Shakespeare!",1012521600,5,2042,4.8530259365994235

But be warned: it is still an old print.  Some reels are better than others, and the whole thing could use a good clean and some scratch removal.

I agree with some reviewers that Wells's vision of the future is fascist in some respects.

""My Man  Godfrey"" and ""Nothing Sacred"" come to mind.  And, of course,  ""Things to Come"".
If one could reify the art deco aesthetic  into a story, this would be it.  If the Chrysler Building really were a  rocket ship and could fly past the the moon and stars and comets of art  deco friezes . . . if we could look into the mindset of those whose naive  and fresh vision of man's destiny had recently been energized by the  discoveries of relativity and of deep space and of rocket travel and their  implications . . . we would perhaps come up with the image of ""Things  to Come"".

931005,5,6304818254,"Things To Come is a stunning view of a quixotic future, with an apocalyptic End of Days followed by a millenarian Rebirth. The vision of Raymond Massey staring into the night sky as Humanity's seed is flung to  the stars, asking ""All or nothing. Which shall it be?"" is matched  in its emotional power only by Edmund Gwenn's ""Nobody can  predict"" closure in Them, and underscores Mankind's impetus to the  stars that drives us today. Behind the images, Things To Come provides a  wealth of insight into England's intellectual milieu in the 1930s. Massey's  horror at the prospect of a new world war, and his companions' disbelief  that any power or statesman could contemplate one, reflects the war-weary  nature of the British public in 1935 and the country's refusal to  acknowledge that Hitler, who had just come to power, had more in mind than  mere bluff. ""Another speech by him? It's nothing I tell you.  Threatened wars never occur."" The subsequent locust-like invasion of  England by hordes of foreign aircraft flying over the cliffs of Dover was  prophetic in that this actually occurred shortly thereafter in 1940. The  film is steeped in Marxist ideology, as were English intellectuals at the  time. TTC suggests that war is not waged by particular humans but is a  function of capitalism, and can only be prevented by a total transformation  of society. The futuristic civilization that finally emerges is the ideal  of 1930s English socialism. A society of workers is ruled by a committee of  technocrats headed by Massey who defends ""our Revolution"" by  forcibly suppressing all independent states (with ""peace gas""  thus distinguishing those poorly bred Bolsheviks who actually shot people).  One almost sympathizes with Cedric Hardwicke when he leads a new revolution  against Massey's descendant, except that his own vision is retrograde and  even less tolerant than Massey's, if that were possible.
