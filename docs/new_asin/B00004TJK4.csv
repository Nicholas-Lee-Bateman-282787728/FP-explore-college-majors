7922588,5,B00004TJK4,"Wonderful production, beautiful scenery, brightly colored characters. Good ""crisis-proofing"" for potential crises like sleepovers, doctor visits and darkness. Good role models for sharing feelings and working through fears with play. Children loved it. They danced and sang along and immediately identified with the characters. ""I slept over at my grandma's house and I was scared too."" ""Lets pretend we're going to the doctor's office."" ""The dragon had a thorn in his foot.""  Ages 2-5.",1000252800,2,486,5.5675675675675675
7922589,3,B00004TJK4,these are simply three episodes of dragon tales that can just as easily be viewed on pbs.  my 3 year old enjoyed them but tired of the same three  episodes after a short time.,966124800,3,175,4.117647058823529
7922590,5,B00004TJK4,"What a wonderful video!  My 3 year old loves Dragon Tales and this video puts together 3 very good shows.  It teaches children that it is ok to be  afraid and that talking about it will help. It also teaches parents to be  patient and work with children, on their level, to over come their fears.",965088000,,296,4.232142857142857
7922591,5,B00004TJK4,This video is a collection of three of the shows on PBS. The kids love it since it does not have commercials. Highly recommended.,965088000,,129,4.416666666666667
