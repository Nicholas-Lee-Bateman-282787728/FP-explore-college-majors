8004840,4,B0000ZG090,"I did like David Janssen playing in a role that made him the ""bad guy"" and think he did it well; however I prefer him playing a good victim as he does in the Fugitive.",1378080000,,167,3.8
8004841,3,B0000ZG090,"One of a series of similar themed films released circa 1959 - 1964. And in my opinion the worst of them all. The film is weak, David Jassen game but miscast. With only Micky Rooney to make the movie watchable. Helped by some fine Hollywood character actors such as Micky Shaughnessy, William Demarest and Keenan Wynn. If not the direction or script. Available only as an Archive Collection release it is an expensive buy. And not really worth its cost. Not unless you are a huge fan/collector of these. Gangster and semi gangster black&white low budget. Semi exploition films. Instead I suggest passing on this one. And perhaps buying the wonderful 'The Rise And Fall Of Legs Diamond' or Rooney's fine prison flick 'The Last Mile'instead. Both available from the same source but worth every penny.",1366156800,,797,4.867647058823529
8004842,3,B0000ZG090,"King of the Roaring 20's (hereafter, KR20s) - The Story of Arnold
Rothstein (1961) is great for those keen on  the perspective of
the 50's  generation about events at the turn of the 20th century,
during prohibition and Wall St.

KR20's is a professional, serious and respectable portrayal of the
1920's and 1930's era in the USA, albeit sugar-coated and spun
lite. This is the case, from the feminine audience in mind, and a
desire in never losing sight of its entertainment objective.

David Janssen  as  Arnold Rothstein,  Dianne Foster as  Carolyn
his wife,  Mickey Rooney as  Johnny his childhood pal are
remarkably sincere actors, and connect astoundingly well with the
audience, and a  natural charisma, also the case for Jack Carson
as officer O'Brien.

KR20's succeeds in demonstrating the tremendous wealth of
Rothstein and his family, a workoholic nature, an infinite number
of luxuries, furniture, jewelry, clocks, chandeliers, silverware,
opulent decorations, silk pijamas and night gown,  tuxedos and 3
piece suits, in between underlining the social etiquette of rich
folk, high-end parties (charleston dance, live big band, string
quartets), mannerisms s of communicating.  This angle is
underlined as well with the frequency of scenes showing AR and his
wife being waited on, as patrons, and AR owning racing horses and
part of a stables, and gambling on track competitions,

The personal life of AR centers on the seduction of a dancing girl
(Foster), not before hiring a P.I to look into her schooling,
friends and background. The old values of Rothstein's family, is
exposed when his father reveals concerns of the nature of the
girl's career, parents (or lack thereof) and  intensity of her
Faith. Those clash with AR's own business ethics and personal
values.

Part of the story bravely goes into backroom deals needed before
the go ahead to any underworld investment (the law taking an
active part, in return for some profits or career promotions),
brow beating and physical intimidation, etc, while at the same
time, showing the vulnerability of the most powerful men in face
of being front page news and the object of a public outcry.

The accuracy of the script, is an open question, especially the
part of Johnny being a business partner, having started with crap
and dice games on the streets, later bookie operation taking bets,
and other rackets.

Paradoxically, AR's upstanding moral character depicted from being
of rich folk, is counterpoised with his passion for the street
rackets, riding with hoodlums, buying off officers, etc. It is
also defined through Rooney's character,  shown as having
an ease in spilling secrets,  drinking, lacking composure.

AR is said to habitually walk in public with tens of thousands of
dollars in his pockets, despising the banks which he labels as
shady.  AR is also said to run boilerrooms, employing high
pressure salesmen pulling in whales for various penny stock
promotions. The gambling operations include roulette games, some
of which are run by his own croupiers, dealing cards or games to
conspirator or patsy players, bleeding the casino dry. He is said
to have thrown a World Series.

Overall, the picture is time well spent, as this clever, modern,
insidious businessman and city slicker meets his maker, soon
before the Great Depression.",1269993600,3,3318,5.1359404096834265
8004843,5,B0000ZG090,"I originally saw this on Television as a kid and it was titled ""The Big Bankroll"" at that time. It concerns the story of Arnold Rothstein who was known as ""The Man Who Fixed The World Series"" during the 1910's and 20's. I enjoyed the film so much that I searched out the book to gain a better understanding of the character in the film. For many years the film has been very difficult to find but then idiot that I am I was looking for it under it's original title! It is a fast paced story and you may have to re-watch it or pause the DVD if you miss anything but if you are interested in history of this period of America it is very good and amazingly accurate.",1261353600,6,663,4.068702290076335
8004844,4,B0000ZG090,"THE KING OF THE ROARING TWENTIES IS STORY OF ARNOLD ROTHSTEIN IN PROHIBITION.
Moving from one scam to another Arnold Rothstein quickly becomes rich, and settles into the life of owning big-town gambling joints. Along the way he falls in loves and marries, makes a life-long enemy of a cop on the take, and gradually becomes hardened even to his closest friends. Many actors were given a break to be in this movie and went on to stardom.
I have placed an image of this movie, showing Diana Dors and more girls getting dresses in their outfits. This is mainly a plot review since no one had made one. Amazon has chosen this as a classic.",1183766400,,635,4.482758620689655
8004845,5,B0000ZG090,"This documentary presents a very powerful message: That HIV/AIDS is real, and if we are not careful, it can haunt us like it haunts this group of men.  But it is absolutely fantastic that these healthy-looking men can continue to lead productive lives even though not denying the fact that their lives have changed forever.  If you want to convince your friend or any type of audience on the demand of practicing safe sex, this is THE VIDEO to get.  It will leave your eyes watered out -- because it is so real.",1017532800,,511,4.473118279569892
