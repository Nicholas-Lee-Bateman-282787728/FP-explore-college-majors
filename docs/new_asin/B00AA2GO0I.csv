8666322,3,B00AA2GO0I,"If this cost more than about $5 USD I would not waste the money on this. It is fascinating and Ms. Hendricks does sing some lovely pieces, but it lacks a sort of backbone that makes the story a story to tell. I love Barbara Hendricks and her thoughts on this opera, but I had hoped I would have gotten to see her perform much more than I saw...I was left with barely ten minutes of performance?",1396915200,,394,4.12987012987013
8666323,4,B00AA2GO0I,"This hour-long documentary features an in-depth behind-the-scenes look at the rehearsal process for ""Don Pasquale"" at the Aix-en-Provence festival in 1990, focusing on the contribution of the production's leading soprano, Barbara Hendricks.  Ms. Hendricks provides many comments about her life and studies, in addition to her thoughts on rehearsing/performing and on the role of Norina in ""Pasquale"" in particular.  Extensive rehearsal footage is included, with three complete scenes from a live performance at the end of the film.  In addition to Hendricks, the other primary interest here is the superb Gabriel Bacquier as Pasquale.  The picture is rather grainy, and close-ups are often too close, but it's a pleasant production that transports the viewer back in time to what must have been a wonderful summer for Hendricks and the production team.",1364515200,3,852,5.480916030534351
