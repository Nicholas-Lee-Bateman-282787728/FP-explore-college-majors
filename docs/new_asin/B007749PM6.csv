While Hooligans does have some fantastically shot and choreographed fight scenes the movie is more than a bunch of guys beating the crap out of each other. It's the story of how a man can learn to believe in both himself and something larger (brotherhood). I highly recommend it.

Technically - the bluray opening previews were sound only, no video, I was able to 'chapter skip' ahead and get to the movie menu which shows up fine and the actual movie itself plays wonderfully for the US bluray region.

I'm forever blowing bubbles.",1359072000,7,669,4.661016949152542
