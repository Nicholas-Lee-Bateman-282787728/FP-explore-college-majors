3748253,5,B001PJRAUI,I enjoy watching Mr. Ferrara.  I love the way he tells his stories and the way he cracks himself up!  I have not laughed at a comedian this hard in a while.  Love it!,1247961600,,166,3.823529411764706

3748255,5,B001PJRAUI,"""I've got spoons hidden all over this house! Keep it up and your napkin rings will start to disappear!""

That was the tag line from Ferrara's first comedy central special where he talked about his relationship with his girlfriend. So many jokes to make you laugh. Ferrara is not a stand-still comic. He is very animated, such as in his Lincoln joke where he claims the dismount is the hardest part of the joke. This is much the same although rather then talking about how much he likes his girlfriend he talks about how much of a bad experience it was, everything from the jewish food to her family. Yes this was more about his ex then anything, but it was still very funny.

I will say I like the original comedy central special more then I like this ""funny as hell"" routine, but this one is still a great laugh.",1242777600,,813,4.377483443708609

3748260,5,B001PJRAUI,Adam is a riot!!  I have enjoyed his work ever since his Comedy Central spots.  His stories about his girlfriends and his parents are touching and hilarious at the same time.  He is very real on stage and it is especially funny when a memory gets him laughing as well.  Great job Adam and I look forward to your next special!!!,1404432000,,327,4.311475409836065

3748269,4,B001PJRAUI,This stand up special is really funny not much to say about the comedy other than spectacular. The special features include 1 outtake not outtakes like the dvd says and this outtake can be found on his youtube at [...]. Also it has a video of the photo shoot for the dvd not much to say about this and the final special feature is Mom&Pop this is a video of his parents backstage talking about one of the late night hosts this special feature is good because Adam's father is really funny. I gave this a four because of the some what lack of special features and towards the end of the special the jokes are not that good. In all i would say get this if your getting it for a good price like the one on here.,1296172800,,708,4.100719424460432
3748270,5,B001PJRAUI,This guy is funny as hell. i love his jokes about his dad doing the answering machine i nearly fell out of my chair. this guy is awesome. if you have not seen this movie then you should,1288137600,,185,3.8947368421052633
3748271,5,B001PJRAUI,"Adam Ferrara is flat out hilarious.  His relaxed manner lets every joke land just so -- it feels like a living room conversation.  Except for the part where you're pounding your fist on the couch because he's so funny.

I won't quote him here -- I wouldn't presume.  Suffice it to say no one is safe.  Especially Ferrara himself, as his self-deprecating, scathingly honest commentary on life, love, death, ethnicity, the battle of the sexes, life with Dad and just about everything else had my wife and me howling for a solid hour.

Rent, buy, watch, laugh.

3748272,5,B001PJRAUI,This is one of the funniest stand-up shows I've seen in a looong time! I laughed till my stomach hurt and tears ran down my face. A must see!,1259625600,,141,3.896551724137931
3748273,3,B001PJRAUI,"I don't know what to say, its a nice stand up comedy for the first part of the show, say the early 30 minutes, great hilarious moments.
However the momentum seriously drops down after a while and reduced to family jokes, more like gossiping, which all of us are short of not!. Think of it as fillers

If i want to put a price tag, I would say 8$ is more than plenty. Never the less , Adam Ferrara has an enjoyable character and I would love to see his future work.",1256083200,,464,4.043478260869565
3748274,5,B001PJRAUI,"We saw Adam Ferrara live at Governor's Comedy Club on Long Island - he was HYSTERICAL!!!  We were laughing our a.. off!!!!  lol  He's so funny!!!

Some of the material on the video is the same as we saw in person, but we still laughed as hard as if we never heard it before!!  Excellent!

Adam Ferrara is cute, very very funny, and has a great smile!!!!!!!  Love him!!!",1253232000,,454,4.186046511627907
