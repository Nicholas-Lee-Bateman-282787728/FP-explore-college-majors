8065881,5,B0009S2K92,"If you are an Eames fan, this is a must have.  These films were a part of their lives and is a part of their legacy.  It's all connected.",1392249600,,137,3.689655172413793
8065882,5,B0009S2K92,"Filmed during the '60s, '70s, and '80s, these films are a wonderful look into the creative collective that was Eames design. Two standout films from the first disc are ""The Power of Ten"" - perhaps their most famous film - which feels like an acid trip about distance, scale, and picnics that takes you through the nethersphere then into microbial DNA strands and the little guys deep inside them. It's exceptional for anyone who wants to gather some sense of scale and to get an illustrated view of what all of the little zeros mean once you cross the one billion mark. The second film, whose title escapes me right now, is a twenty minute, or so, look at the Eames office physical space being deconstructed when the business was closed. What's so cool about this is to see all of the inspirational nonsense on the walls, furniture in all states of usability, the physical reckoning of filing 50 years of production and inspirational minutae into what began as an open, static floor plan, that grew over time into an intricate labrynth of shelves, desks, partitions, and eeked out office space. Watch them pull everything apart, piece by piece, and you feel like a little piece of the space's soul is being removed. It's unbelievably moving. SSo, what are you waiting for? Click the buy button. This set is amazing if you're ready for it.",1273795200,3,1338,4.697872340425532
8065883,4,B0009S2K92,"If you are fascinated by the talents of the Eames' and want to build a fuller insight into the extent of their work then this is certainly worth getting. Be warned though that this has very little to do with their work as furniture designers and more to do with the films they produced either as personal projects or commissioned by companies such as IBM.

The movies are quaint and endearing, lovely 60s animations and models they built in their studio.

There is a nice film made by the family of the Eames' workshop when they packed it up after their death - we get to see the textures and environment of their work areas. the sound track to some of this films, particularly this one, can get a bit jarring, but the sound is relevant as it is from the music box they used to have.",1222992000,2,783,4.319727891156463
8065884,5,B0009S2K92,"The work of Charles and Ray Eames remains the strongest design voice of the century. This collection of their own films and works of others relating to their products and ideas illustrates the power of design.  It opens the world of design to everyone.  As a teacher, I use these films to demonstrate the design process and to inspire students to think and inact using both their intellect and their inuition.  All the work is done with fun and imagination!",1180396800,8,457,4.6875
8065885,4,B0009S2K92,"I bought the films as a surprise Christmas gift for my husband, who loves unusual and ""quirky"" things.  He was just thrilled.  He has enjoyed all the films, but most particularly ""Powers of 10,"" which he plays for anyone who will sit still, including my 3 year old grandson.  I wish I would have taken a picture of the 2 of them, seated in chairs in front of my computer, making appropriate sound effects and exaggerated faces.  Priceless!",1168300800,5,439,4.589743589743589
8065886,5,B0009S2K92,"Charles Eames was the most influential designers of the 20th century.  Chances are you own a knockoff of one of his original and innovative pieces of furniture.  But his work does not stop with chairs: both Charles Eames and his wife Ray (also a genius in her own right and his partner and collaborator for life) created a world of joy, innovation and sheer excitement, with a minimum of materials other than those they often found in empty fields or gutters or wherever and incorporated them into their many films, sculptors, household design, or simple pen aand ink holders.

Their films (and all their work) not only set the stage for movement in design, but influenced the better half of most serious filmmakers whether independent or Studio funded.

Their work is playful, complex, quite simple while being very insightful, and of course they all had the element of using the found object or everyday aspect of life.  From a film about washing a black top playground to a wondrous overlay of toy trains, both conveying the excitement of the old compared to the new but also the sheer elegance of an innate understanding of space and its power to communicate.

For anyone who wishes to see our world anew and with the genius of vision; this is about the BEST series of films anyone appreciating the art of film making and the purity of seeing, could purchase. 10 STARS if it were possible.  DO NOT PASS UP THIS COLLECTION and always remember to keep ones eyes and mind open and receptive: your life will be the better for it and for having had Charles and Ray Eames and their works in our lives.",1167782400,15,1599,4.628975265017668
8065887,5,B0009S2K92,"This collection could be termed Charles and Ray Eames Greatest Hits!  For anyone growing up in the late fifties or early sixties, the Eames' designs were the ultimate in modern sophistication. To my childhood eyes, their style personified what it meant to be an adult.  Their films personify no less. Watching Powers of Ten, Tops or Day of the Dead, I feel like both the wordly adult and the fascinated little kid. It's as if I'm at the 1964 World's Fair again, enjoying all it's wonders AND enjoying a dry martini at the same time. If you'd enjoy seeing the Adult World again just as you saw it when you were a kid, then this collection is a must-have.  For students of design this collection is a must-have. And for devotees of classic High Style this collection is a must-have.",1167177600,13,780,4.557142857142857
8065888,5,B0009S2K92,"If you know who they are you'll probably want these.  The educational films are what such pics should be and almost never are. I was  not interested in the math one but found it fascinating.  My favorite was on vol 2. 19th century American navy ships invade Japan and force them to trade with west as drawn by Japanese artists at the time. Beady eyed giant nosed hairy things in US naval uniforms peer at us across time, Japanese officials sit on a small train and get a taste of the future.  It makes this moment in history real from the Japanese point of view as I've never seen it.",1129852800,8,584,4.281818181818182
