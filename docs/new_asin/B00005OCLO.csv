7948777,2,B00005OCLO,"I bought this movie for one reason: Paul Bettany. I suffered through to the end for the same reason. This movie got a whole two stars because, as always, his acting was superb. That was the only draw of this movie. It takes a lot to offend me, and this movie managed to do it the entire time it was on. It was simply foul. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone except maybe die-hard Paul Bettany fans.",1394928000,,405,4.205128205128205
7948778,5,B00005OCLO,"'Mood Swingers' with Paul Bettany. Well, you really should see this film with someone
,because this film is sick. Drugs, sex and death. I watched this alone, please don't watch this film alone.
 Paul Bettany and cast of this film get into a lot of drugs for fun. Yes, they do! Why ?? To make the story more sick and as it goes on it gets sicker.
This film is not for children or someone with a weak heart. This film isn't easy to watch at all.
The end of the film was great ,because it was over.
Paul Bettany, will wake you right up around the end of this film. I have to say that, Paul Bettany will do any role that dark and filled with anger. I feel Paul Bettany pushes himself again and again so he not put in one kind of role. He doesn't want to do the same role again and again. I love that about Paul Bettany.",1368230400,,815,4.0
7948779,1,B00005OCLO,"I am so upset by how bad an adaptation this is that I am lost for words that could be displayed here. I shall proceed profanity free any how.

Everything good about the novel is lost in this movie, the soundtrack is gut-wrenchingly awful (the irony being that at the end of the version I watched, thay actually advertised in the credits where you could download it), the majority of the characters are completely hollow (I do not beleive for one second they even read the original), and to top it off the costume and design is completely contrived and just plain wrong. Last but not least the biggest mistake was transposing the story to present day. Marsh gave the weakest performance out of the lot, and his direction was severly lacking as well. What should be a dark, funny, chilling and intriguing examination of the human psyche, came out as souped up 'post-trainspotting' trash. Martin Amis apparently gives it his seal of approval, all I can say is he must have been on drugs.",1145491200,,984,4.622857142857143
7948780,1,B00005OCLO,"This picture is a quintessential nihilist picture.  If you share the value system that life has no meaning or value, you may find some comfort in the Conceptualists from this film.  William Marsh who plays the drug-dealing Marvel in the film also directed and wrote the screenplay.  I have no idea what the feud entailed between Marsh and producer Holmes' final cut of the film, but I doubt it could essentially be less dreadful.  Paul Bettany has shown himself to have a great range from ""Wimbledon"" to ""Gangster No. 1,"" so I wanted to see this film.  As the self-absorbed Quentin, he turns in another performance that surpasses the material.  Titled ""Dead Babies"" in England, ""Mood Swingers"" shows a group of bored and insecure people getting together for the weekend for drugs and free sex.  Olivia Williams who starred as the mother in ""Peter Pan"" and the wife in ""The 6th Sense"" is a bored and restless woman looking for kicks.  Alexandra Gilbreath plays Bettany's wife and is equally restless for some unnamed satisfaction.  She looks nice dancing in her sheer floral print blouse, but one hardly understands what draws the character to this loose company.  Andy Nyman as the pimple-faced heavy-set loser who prances around in his bathrobe wondering why he can't find a lover turns in one of the best performances.  Charlie Condon as Giles also does a nice job as the insecure weakling who worries about his teeth.  Kris Marshall does a great job as the part psycho/part victim/part gay crazy Skip.  Added to this is the nymphomaniac Roxanne played by Hayley Carr and Lucy who has the rep as a loose woman.  All in all, the plot twists through the Conceptualists invading the weekend party and unexpectedly turns to a pile of corpses.  While certainly foreshadowed, the ending still seems to come out of left field.  In the end, watching this film is mostly a waste of time and money.  Taxi!",1113177600,2,1897,4.787692307692308
7948781,2,B00005OCLO,"This is the version I got stuck with.  Completely linear.  No chapters, no menus, no special features, but a decent transfer of FULL FRAME Version.  Hit the menu button or chapter advance and you start the whole movie over.  May as well be VHS.  Buyers beware!  Ask your sellers which version your getting. Too bad because this is a fun film.",1102636800,7,342,4.524590163934426
7948782,4,B00005OCLO,"In spite of a somewhat ham-fisted ending, Mood Swingers delivers the goods.  It's a relatively plotless tale of a bunch of young blokes and babes who converge in London--three of them are American--for a weekend of drug-induced chaos.  The drug supplier is played by the same chap who wrote and directed the film, which is based on a novel by British bad boy author Martin Amis--who even blurbs the film on the DVD front cover!
More an ensemble piece than anything else, the film veers wildly from relatively straightforward narrative to occasionally very imaginative jump cutting.  The thrust here doesn't seem to be storytelling as much as it is a ""let's cram as much sharp dialogue, striking images, and violent segues into this 100 minutes as possible"".  The emphasis is on violence--meaning, not graphic violence (although yes, there is some of that)--but more to the point, a violent, hyperbolic style.
This is in keeping with the source material from Martin Amis.  The youthfulness of the group aligns with their powerful urges for sex and drugs and also with the violent style of the film.  This three-way convergence actually works well and it would have been perfect if the same approach had been used for the ending, which unfortunately descends into a thicker, more predictable mode when the real perpretrator of the graphic violence is revealed.
Nevertheless, this is an interesting film because of the chances it takes stylistically and the often sharp--and funny--dialogue.  The mixture of biting comedy, intense emotionality, and sudden outbursts of manic energy is more than enough to hold your interest throughout.
Different and worthwhile.",1008460800,11,1658,5.164179104477612
