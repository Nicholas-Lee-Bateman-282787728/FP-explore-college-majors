Editorial Reviews
Part of an 11-part series for children grades K-4, this disk takes kids on a fun journey to asnwer questions like, ""Why does light shine through some things and not others?"" and ""Why can we see our reflections in water, but not in a rock?"" Learn how light travels in waves, as well as how those waves behave, including an introduction to the 3 main characteristics of light waves: amplitude, wavelength and frequency. Explore the connection between light and color in a fun, hands-on activity in which kids use a prism to split white light into the colors of the rainbow and then combine colored light to create white light. This program is based on the concepts outlined in the National Science Education Standards for Physical Science.",1343606400,,946,4.89375
