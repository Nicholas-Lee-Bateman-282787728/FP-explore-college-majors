8180064,4,B000NOK24M,"I have a lot of Wing Chun and TCMA books and videos and I would rate this above average. I am closing in on my third decade of practicing Wing Chun, and my second of teaching. Although Tei Sifu is stylistically different from my sifu, he still has some interesting takes on drills and applications that I was able to adapt to my teachings.",1350777600,,339,4.3125
8180065,5,B000NOK24M,"One of the best DVD martial arts training sets for Wing Chun Kung Fu that I've come across. For over 16 years I've been training on and off beginning with Shaolin Kung Fu then Wing Chun Kung Fu classes (training in a class setting is by far the best way). For me, this 5 DVD collection is very close to the feel of training in a real class situation. The production value is as simple as you can get and offers easy to understand instruction and applications of the Wing Chun forms and weapons. Having formerly trained under a Wing Chun instructor, I could immediately react to the benefits of this very valuable alternative training tool and I responded favorably to the instructor on the DVDs, Sifu Todd Shawn Tei. Sifu Todd offers great commentary and explanations of the techniques as well as demonstrates their applications with the use of his students. I highly recommend getting the whole set, since each DVD breaks down the instruction: The 3 forms are covered separately on their own DVD vol. 1-3, vol. 4 focuses on the 116 Wooden Dummy techniques and weapons forms (nunchakus, butterfly broad swords, staff, and more), and vol. 5 focuses on street fighting techniques. Great overall DVD collection to learn Wing Chun Kung Fu.",1193875200,4,1235,4.748837209302326
