8563888,4,B00B81NRHI,"Such a hilarious idea.  It's basically an audition show like a lot of other shows that are SUPER popular right now...only this one goes horribly wrong and people die.  It's like they made Idol into a horror movie.  The movie itself isn't hilarious, however, it's actually quite a decent thriller...I mean, the humor element is there, but it's not goofy to the point of bad.  This is a good one.",1384128000,,394,4.585714285714285
8563889,5,B00B81NRHI,"Woah - pretty awesome flick. I'm surprised by this point that this wasn't based on true events.  Some of the people that go audition for these talent shows are insane, plain and simple.",1374710400,,185,4.606060606060606
8563890,4,B00B81NRHI,"Wow- this movie is pretty trippy. I don't want to ruin the plot for you, but I'll say that it kept me on the edge of my seat. American Idol and all those shows should be like this - heh heh",1362614400,,189,3.6341463414634148
