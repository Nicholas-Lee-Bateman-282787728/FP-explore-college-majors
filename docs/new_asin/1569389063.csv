187420,5,1569389063,"Mythologist Joseph Campbell is perhaps best known for his PBS series, The Power of Myth, a television program aimed at reawakening mythic consciousness in everyday life. In ""Sukhavati"", the Joseph Campbell foundation combines some of Campbell's best work along with mythic imagery and music from around the world into a short but concise 78 minute introduction to the world of global mythology.

""Sukhavati"" spans a number of spiritual traditions, most notably Hindu and Buddhist as well as the mythology of the Great Goddess, the ancient Greeks, indigenous peoples, and the Holy Grail to convey myth as a central component of spiritual experience. Though not specifically Witchcraft or neo-Paganism, Campbell covers elements central to contemporary Pagan theology, specifically in his analysis of the Mother Goddess, ""She is time, space, causality...she is the giver of life and she is the giver of nourishment...the whole universe, the sphere of the universe is the womb of the Goddess and the deities and all the names and all the forms are within her bounds.""

Perhaps one downfall of this DVD is that those unfamiliar with mythic concepts may find the film too abstract or nebulous. Still, ""Sukhavati"" is a heartfelt and intelligent exploration of the function of myth in spirituality and how it is applicable to one's life; to understand the power of mythic consciousness and find one's own sukhavati, or ""place of bliss"". As Campbell teaches, ""We're in a free fall into future... And always when you're going through a long tunnel, anxiety comes along. But all you have to do to transform your hell into a paradise is to turn your fall into a voluntary act... Joyfully participate in the sorrows of the world and everything changes.""

187553,5,1569389063,"All of the other DVDs I have seen of Joseph Campbell, prior to this one, have been interview formats, so it was a pleasant change of pace to see him in his natural environment as a teacher, in front of classes teaching students.

Of course the DVD switched from shots of him in front of students to a variety of other settings, often beautiful and very spiritual places he had visited and seen for himself. One of these places was a beautiful cathedral. Although my wife is Jewish and not very religious at all, she was touched by the sight of this cathedral, as was I.
Another place he showed pictures of and described as a place that still emanated a feeling of power, was a cave showing early pictures that depicted religious beliefs of early men who lived in that area.

The whole DVD was well done in my opinion, including background music, art work, and film work. Joseph Campbell: Sukhavati is well worth the small price I paid.

Through SUKHAVATI Campbell weaves so-called primitive philosophies in order to provide the viewer not with instruction, but with doorways to discover their own spiritualism. Through SUKHAVATI the viewer is walked through philosophical development. Not once does Campbell impose his perspectives through his informative lectures, but instead opens the flower of possibilities one petal at a time. For me it was SUKHAVATI that supported Campell's writings; writings in which I had immersed myself in order to properly weigh his information.
In conjunction with a plethora of writers and artists I methodically developed through fiction not ""The Hero With a Thousand Faces"" but The HEROINE with multiple countenances through my 4 novels guaranteed to charge a new and improved attitude:

187557,5,1569389063,"Sukhavati is a compilation of a variety of lectures given by Mr. Campbell over the course of many years(10+). This DVD provides a cursory view from JC's scholarly perspective on a dizzying array of subject matters, from economics to religion, from cavemen to astronauts and most importantly from the depths of human psychology to the relationship with mythology.

This DVD can take you places you can't even begin to imagine, if you let it.

""You hear a pang, mother or something...""
-Freud or Campbell?

""'Very deep is the well of the past, should we not call it bottomless?' And as one who has strived himself to go back to the origins of mythic forms, I can see this, it is bottomless. The mythological themes don't have a beginning, they have the archetypes....And so where is paradise, where do they come from? They come from desilee, the soul. The origin is from the soul of man.""
-Campbell

""At present, our world has rejected this world of symbology. It has gone into an
economic and political phase, where spiritual principles are completely disregarded. You may have practical ethics and that kind of thing, but there is no
spirituality in any aspect of our contemporary Western civilization. Our religious
life is ethical, not mystical. The mystery has gone and society is disintegrating as a result.""
-Campbell

""The question is whether or not there can ever be a recovery of the mythological,
mystical realization of the miracle of life of which human beings are a manifestation.""
-Campbell

187559,3,1569389063,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I got this video but I have to say it was intriguing.  The video itself is fairly well done with a mix of haunting music, mythological imagery and parts of a taped seminar by Campbell which at times mimics a spoken word performance.

He discusses throughout the video historical references that relate to spirituality and the true nature of us all.  I appreciate this sort of information as I am a healer by trade.  Personally I prefer a more straightforward discussion on the topic however I'm certain that a lot of folks will be captivated by the imagery, spoken word and the message that comes forward.

3 Stars based on a less than perfect delivery of significant information for the soul.  Worth checking out if you are into the metaphysical.  You may want to netflix this one first unless you are Campbell fan.

187564,5,1569389063,"Joseph Campbell was an amazing man full of insight and understanding of the religions of the world and how they all are the same metaphorically, and they all share common themes since the dawn of time. I will share some of his perceptions and thoughts from this DVD.
There is a wealth of information here that will inspire anyone to a spiritual life and the wonders of the great mysteries of life and God as Campbell sees him. Joseph Campbell was an enlightened man full of the wonder and joy of life. Just watching him I feel a deep sense of connection to God and the mysteries of the universal cosmic truths.

 Myths and dreams are transformations of consciousness and are the way to a deep rich life of mystery; transforming thought. The Ego is the dragon holding you in and keeping you small. Following your bliss by doing what brings you vitality within yourself saves the world. The Buddha says that Nirvana is a psychological state of mind that is not compelled by desire, fear or social commitments or acting out of our own center. We are all seeking an experience of being alive; we are not seeking meaning of life since there is none really. It's the inner value we seek and it is not in what we do. The ultimate mystery of being transcends thought and cannot be understood. God is transcendent and God is within our world, others and us. Eternity is here and now. This is it and we must get it from within ourselves not out there and not after we die!  We cannot concretize that symbols as fact. Jesus did not ascend up but within us. All the symbols are metaphors and are not fact. We are all manifestations of Buddha consciousness. Jesus is within us all just as are heaven, and Hell and all the Gods. Inward we are the source. All religions are true for their time. Open up to the mysteries of life of all things, and make a choice to stay in your life and realize the truth and depth of your experience of your own being through consciousness and bliss. Experience it here and now.

Do not judge. Open-up and love thy enemy. These, Campbell says, are Jesus' greatest teachings.

We need to shift the perception to joyful participation in the sorrows of life and everything changes. Find the immoveable center within yourself and we can survive anything and float down the stream of life. To save the world we must save ourselves. The influence of a vital person vitalizes the world. The world is a wasteland and we cannot save the world by shifting it around. Bring it to life by being alive yourself.

Choose to affirm life. Life is great say yes to it. It is a childish way of thinking to say no to life with all its pain. We all participate in evil. No matter what we do it's evil to somebody. If all the universe is Divine how can we say no to anything in the world? Brutality, stupidity, thoughtless ness and suffering; we must say yes. Affirm the world and life. We are not to judge anything. This is the greatest teaching of Jesus. Affirm both good and evil. Do not withdrawal from the world when you realize how horrible it is, but see the horror as the foreground of a wonder. Come back and participate in it.

To be spiritual we need a deep sense of mystery of the dimension of the universe that is not available to the senses. Divinity is the realization of wonder that is much larger then the human dimension. Divinity is just what we think. God is a metaphor of what is guiding you and comes from within. The transcendent mystery is where we come from and we do not have to identify it. I am the vehicle radiant of the spirit, as we all are. The virgin birth is the symbol of the birth of the heart to the awakening of the spiritual life in accord with another or a principle. To not be driven by the lower centers of lust, greed, power and wanting but to be driven from the compassion of the heart to open-up to the realization that God is within the other and us; a whole new life comes.

The ultimate mystery is finding God within you. That God is within us just as he is within the earth and all of nature and everything. God is everywhere. This is the real truth- He is not up in the sky separate from us, but within us and around us supporting us always, and we just need to become awake to this fact. I can see why the goal is to die before we die. To die to our animal and material nature and become reborn to the spiritual nature, which is our true nature.

And he often mentions how we are to live our lives in accord with nature and to worship nature just as most of the world does. Western Christian thought sees nature as fallen and our religion is one of exile that nature is fallen and evil. This is ridiculous Campbell says because what else do we have to worship then nature? All other religions but Christianity, teach to live in accord with nature and the God's are much more elemental of the earth. We come from the earth and are a part of the Earth not separate from it.

Here is a quote from Chief Seattle that Campbell dictates and lives by:
 ""Will you teach your children what we teach our children, that the earth is our mother? What befalls the earth befalls all the sons of the earth. Earth does not belong to man; Man belongs to the earth. All things are connected like the blood that unites us all. Man did not weave the web of life; he is merely a strand in it. What he does to the web he does to himself. One thing we know, our God is also your God. The earth is precious to him and to harm the earth is to heap contempt on its creator. Your destiny is a mystery to us. What will happen when the buffalo are all slaughtered? The wild horses tamed? What will happen when the secret corners of the forest are heavy with the scent of man? When the view of the ripe hills is blocked by talking wires? Where will the thicket be? Gone. Where will the eagle be? Gone. What is it to say goodbye to the swift pony and the hunt? The end of living and the beginning of survival.""",1195862400,47,5927,4.283035714285714

7797043,4,1569389063,"Sukhavati is a very fascinating documentary about various aspects of folklore and religion, primarily Hinduism and the stories of King Arthur, by the renowned religion scholar and folklorist, Joseph Campbell (1904-1987). There are two reasons why I have chosen to deduct one star from my review. First of all, I was expecting it to be a comprehensive box set with several lectures on various aspects of Hinduism on it, NOT merely the hour and eighteen minutes which is on this disc. Since the topics are so interesting to me as a scholar of religion and as one who is spiritually attracted to the religion, I was expecting ""Sukhavati"" to have multiple discs and multiple lectures on various aspects of Hinduism and/or India in general; and so while I certainly enjoyed this documentary and would recommend it to all fans of Joseph Campbell and to those wishing to learn about both Hinduism and King Arthur, I was somewhat disappointed that it was just one documentary rather than a series. I just wish it had been more comprehensive. Furthermore, while I do think that his claim that certain religious and folkloric systems should supposedly be abandoned based solely on the fact that they are not confirmed by empirical reality is narrow minded and is a classic example of what the philosopher Susan Haack calls ""Scientism"" (i.e.the worldview that asserts that science and the scientific method is the only source---or at least, the best source---of truth and/or the only source for answers to life's questions). I DO, however, agree with him that Hinduism---and really all of the religions of India---are the religious and folkloric systems which are the most compatible with the contemporary scientific understanding of the world. For Mr. Campbell to imply that religions and/or folkloric systems that do not conform to the standards of modern science are supposedly irrelevant, useless and/or false in the so-called modern age is incredibly arrogant and narrow-minded. . In fact, there is a great book which talks about a lot of the scientific facts that were known by the ancient sages of India---the rishis (male sages) or rishikas (female sages)---who had composed the various hymns in the Vedas, the Puranas, and other Hindu scriptures. It is called Advancements in Ancient Indias Vedic Culture by Stephen K. Knapp. Mr. Knapp is an American-born convert to Hinduism. In fact, according to Mr. Knapp's book, the rishis and rishikas were in fact scientists, mathematicians, scholars and philosophers in addition to being yogis, yoginis and religious leaders. I also give this documentary three stars instead of five because while it was very interesting, I was expecting that it would be a box set similar to Joseph Campbells series, Mythos, it ended up only being one short, hour-long program. I was expecting it to be much more in-depth. To conclude, this documentary is very interesting. I would highly recommend it.",1522540800,,2925,5.108559498956159
7797044,5,1569389063,"We learn or see what we already know. But sometimes it is hard to articulate; Joseph Campbell can. It becomes black and white, time and eternal.

The eastern religions and ancient realigns share the path of enlightenment. However it is up to us to make the journey. Only the western religion is at odds with nature by making symbols facts.

The message is reiterated in several ways so we have opportunity to realize that we need forgotten symbols and can regain them through our dreams.

He leaves us with the question as to will we ever be able to become one with nature once more?

Hinduism gives us the best presentation or mythology to fit our time.

I bought it used because the ad said that it still played fine.  I would like to return it for a refund. Please forward me the info to do so.,1470096000,,287,4.053571428571429
