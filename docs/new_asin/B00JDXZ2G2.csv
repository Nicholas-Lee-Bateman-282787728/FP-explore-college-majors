This 1939 film won many Academy Awards and was the most successful movies in Hollywoods history. It is the story about a wealthy, spoiled, and beautiful woman who cant marry the man she loves, is widowed twice, then is rejected by her first choice and third husband. [She looks the same after the passage of years and the war that destroys her society and country. This destruction symbolizes the Great Depression which also created changes in America.] This four hour movie uses one disc for its programming content, which suggests EP mode and a less than optimal video.

It begins in 1861 when there is talk about a war as if it were a sporting event and not a catastrophe. The scenes show life for the OHara family who own a large cotton plantation. There is little mention of the life of their workers or ordinary people. Scarlett loves Ashley, but he marries Melanie. Do girls still argue like Scarlett and Suellen? The cotton plantation owners want to fight the Northern states to keep slavery which produces the wealth enjoyed by their owners. [A rich mans war but a poor mans fight. There was no mention of the Dred Scott decision which overturned the Missouri Compromise of 1820. What did the Justices get for this decision?] Scarlett marries Charles after being rejected by Ashley, but she is soon widowed. The early success of General Lee is not repeated. Rhett Butler is a blockade runner who smuggles imports.

The Battle of Gettysburg is the turning point in the war; Southern armies will never attack the North again. The heavy losses lead to drafting soldiers on both sides, volunteers are no longer enough. There are food shortages in the South. Shermans Army invades Georgia to split the South, depriving the east from supplies from the west. Tara still stands when Scarlett returns home, she digs roots for food. Im going to live through this and never be hungry again! Scarlett knows how to use a revolver to protect herself from a looter! After the war the Occupation brings new political rule, the slaves are free and can vote. Tara is hit with property taxes, Scarlett marries a wealthy businessman. Convicts now provide cheap labor for the plantation.

Money is the most important thing in this world says Scarlett. Rhett Butler says money will buy everything. Scarlett becomes a widow again, Rhett marries Scarlett. [Has she found true happiness? Some people never do.] Scarlett goes to a party alone and is greeted by Melanie. Their young daughter dies after falling from a horse! Later Melanie asks Scarlett to look after her son and Ashley; she is going away on a long trip and won't return. Ashley tells Scarlett he always loved Melanie. Rhett tells Scarlett he is leaving, he is through with everything. Saying Im sorry cant make up for the past. What will Scarlett do now? Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn. Scarlett know tomorrow is another day.

The above synopsis doesnt do justice to this very long and complicated story. Its lesson seems to be that pride and arrogance lead to failure. Pride is said to be the deadliest of sins - because those with pride misread or ignore the reality that exists outside of their assumptions and conceptions. What do you think? This is basically a story about personal relationships set in the Old South of the 1860s and how the Civil War affected a slave owning society.",1412208000,,3375,4.752559726962457
