2455475,2,B000CC1TQA,"I believed from the picture and description that this was all Boris Karloff and it isn't.  The quality of the video transfer is poor and sound is often unintelligible. Bought two others in the ""Mystery"" series, but no more.  Save your money at any price for these.",1336780800,7,264,4.595744680851064
2455476,5,B000CC1TQA,Truly enjoyed watching this old movies and well worth the money.  Fear in the night was new to me and a real thriller. If you like good old movies you will love this collection for sure.,1336780800,10,186,4.166666666666667
2455477,5,B000CC1TQA,"This package contains a variety of movies. I have not watched all of them yet, but for the price, you have access to older movies that may not be shown on television, but are excellent with good casts and good stories.",1329436800,,218,4.341463414634147
2455478,5,B000CC1TQA,Boris Karloff was great in these movies.  I never did like the horror movies that he was in but these I really like.  He did a exceptional job as Mr Wong.  Well worth the little price that was paid.  The picture and sound was very good.,1211846400,54,236,4.065217391304348

2455480,4,B000CC1TQA,Mildly interesting films from very poor quality prints.  Some films are pretty good and some are laughable.  Echo Bridge Home Entertainment (ebhe.com) has them cheaper than Amazon.,1435363200,,180,5.62962962962963
2455481,3,B000CC1TQA,shows how marketing exploits a customers desires.  Was disappointed to find only one episosde of Mr. Wong.  The others were so-so.,1428883200,,130,5.142857142857143

2455490,3,B000CC1TQA,Disappointed in quality of pictures on DVD.,1410307200,,43,5.285714285714286
2455491,5,B000CC1TQA,A brilliant collection of the classic mystery movies.,1410134400,,53,5.75
2455492,4,B000CC1TQA,"FIRST I WANT TO SAY THAT MR RAINS HAS BEEN A LONG TIME FAVORITE OF MINE EVER SINCE I WATCHED HIM IN THE INVISIBLE (John Cena's ""you can't see me"") MAN: AND ALSO IN ""ANGEL ON MY SHOULDER"" WITH THE GREAT PAUL MUNI. I BELIEVE THE PART HE PLAYED IN ""THE CLAIRVOYANT"" IS HIS CUP OF TEA. HE IS GOOD AT THESE KIND OF ROLES.

THE FATAL HOUR WITH MR KARLOFF AND AN OLD FAVORITE CHARACTER ACTOR; GRANT WITHERS; WAS A GOOD AND FUNNY STORY. NOT EXCITING BUT ACCEPTABLE FOR ME. MARJORIE REYNOLDS: WHO PLAYED IN ""THE LIFE OF RILEY"" IS A CHARMING ADDITION TO THE STORY AS WELL. I LOVE THESE BLACK & WHITE FLICKS OF OLD.

""FEAR INTHE NIGHT"" WAS DONE WELL BUT IT REMINDED ME OF AN OLD TV MOVIE (The name I can't remember; with Keith Brazzelle; playing a similar role.) ALL & ALL NOT A BAD SHOW.

I HAVE SAVED ""THE DEVIL'S PARTY"" FOR LAST BECAUSE IT WAS THE BETTER OF THE FOUR FILMS. TO ME IT WAS A MOVIE KIND OF RESEMBLING ""ANGEL'S WITH DIRTY FACES"" WITH A TWIST. IT WAS A FIRST RATE STORY WITH ONE OF THE BIGGEST MEN IN MOVIES: VICTOR MCLAGHLIN. (I know it's not spelled right.) HE PLAYED HIS ROLE TO THE HILT. IT WAS ALSO GOOD TO SEE MR GARGAN IN A THE FILM; WHOM I HAVEN'T SEEN A FILM WITH HIM IN IT FOR MANY YEARS. I RECOMMEND THIS FILM TO ALL WHO WOULD ENJOY WATCHING; CAGNEY, BOGART, ROBINSON, GARFIELD OR MANY MNAY MORE OF OUR PAST GANGSTER MOVIES. THIS IS A CLASS #1 NOIR FILM TO ME. IT ALONE WAS A 5...",1398988800,3,1394,4.043478260869565
2455493,4,B000CC1TQA,Ths volume of the series has an eclctic selection. Four different movies with four different approaches to mystery. The conclusions of the movies are different as one can imagine.,1374624000,11,179,5.206896551724138
2455494,5,B000CC1TQA,"All these movies are great. The Clairvoyant is very good thriller with Claude Rains and King Kong's Fay Wray. Fear in the night with Deforest Kelly (doc Star Trek)and also a good thriller. Boris Karloff in the Fatal Hour is also good, as this was a different type of roll for him. All 4 movies are worth the price.",1373846400,12,314,4.338983050847458
2455495,5,B000CC1TQA,I love mystery movies that why I bought this can not wait too watch it I will buy more mystery movies again,1370995200,,107,3.909090909090909
2455496,5,B000CC1TQA,I had never heard of these movies before; but I love old mystery classics. These movies were great. I enjoyed every last one of them. I am going to order more of these classics. I got this one and another one at the same time and I have watched them both. Anyone who really loves mystery movies; these should be in your collection.,1365811200,3,331,4.26984126984127

2455498,3,B000CC1TQA,"It hard to believe Boris being a detective you  normally is him in master movies, but the movie was very good. The writing good and compiling",1341619200,,141,4.423076923076923
