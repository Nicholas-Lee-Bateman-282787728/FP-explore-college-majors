You can find a more accurate cover on this other version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Power-Kids/dp/B003DNLLM2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Power Kids</a>.

The plot of the movie is as follows:

A group of young kids who study Muay Thai have a younger brother with a heart condition. After a small feud at a track for remote control car racing the young boy collapses and is rushed to the hospital to receive a heart transplant. Unfortunately, the heart that he will be receiving is at another hospital which has just been overtaken by terrorists (Johnny Nguyen is one of them) demanding political protection of their minority group. Consequently, the heart will not be transported from the hospital in time to save little brother. The remaining four kids sneak into the other hospital through the sewers and use their Muay Thai skills to fight the terrorists. The final battle featuring all four kids is the only fight scene featuring Johnny Nguyen, but it is a good fight and it is very interesting to see how the fight choreography has been adapted to accommodate child fighters. There is also another very funny fight scene featuring the children against an obnoxious, drunk American guy near the beginning of the movie.

Overall, I enjoyed the movie and I recommend it, but I want to caution those who expect a starring role from Johnny Nguyen. I'd also like to point out again that this is a children's movie, but don't let that discourage you. The Thais take their Muay Thai very seriously, so this still has better fight choreography than what we can expect to see in many American or European movies.

One final note... rather than buying this movie by itself, you can purchase it as part of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Power-Kids-Somtum-2-DVD-Set/dp/B005DIZVNK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Power Kids / Somtum [2-DVD] Set</a>.
