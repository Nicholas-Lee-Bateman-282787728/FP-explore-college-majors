8041576,5,B0006GAOS6,The Secret of NIHM is an incredibly beautiful animated movie for people of all ages. It really is incredible. The sequel on the other hand is pure garbage and an insult to anyone who loved the original film...Saturday morning cartoon rubbish. Don't bother with the sequel but the 1st film is wonderful.,1409011200,,302,4.826923076923077

8041578,1,B0006GAOS6,"My daughters and I thoroughly enjoyed Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of NIMH.  We looked forward to the movie, especially with all of the good reviews.  The movie on its own is probably pretty good, but if you have read the book, you'll be extremely disappointed.  We felt like the heart of the book had been changed, and not in a good way.  BOOK:  Nicodemus was the leader of the rats MOVIE:  He had magical powers.  BOOK:  Due to experiments by scientists at NIMH, he was extremely intelligent as were the other rats in his group  MOVIE:  fairly same but added magical abilities for Nicodemus and a magical stone as well.  BOOK:  Jenner had different idea of how things should be done (basically he saw nothing wrong with stealing electricity, etc. and Nicodemus and the others did)  and  he left with a group of rats to create their own colony MOVIE:  Jenner has same opinions but also wants to take control of the colony at any cost and kills Nicodemus, as well as trying to kill Mrs. Frisby and his kids.  Anyway, the differences continue throughout the movie.  We felt like the whole idea of cooperation, bravery, trust and loyalty was lost in the movie with it's need for a terrible villain (other than NIMH) and for magical powers to make everything turn out good in the end.  Following the book would have given a more appealing story:  letting hard work, cooperation, etc. lead to the happy ending.",1206662400,,1402,4.580645161290323
8041579,5,B0006GAOS6,This is a great movie and should be put back out. The shipper got it back out to us very fast.,1198627200,,94,3.5238095238095237
8041580,5,B0006GAOS6,I purchased The Secret of Nimh one and two they were brandnew and unopen! They work perfectly and were shiped very fast!,1185062400,,120,4.5
8041581,5,B0006GAOS6,"""The Secret of N.I.M.H."" is an excellent adaptation of the book ""Mrs. Frisby and the Rats of N.I.M.H.""  Very good animation is combined with a story that only marginally diverges from the book (specifically, the book does not portray Brutus as such an inimical character, and Jenner does not make an appearance at all).  The sequel ""The Secret of N.I.M.H. 2"" is, by comparison,  only average.  It completely divorces itself from the second book in the series (""Racso and the Rats of N.I.M.H."", a very good read in its own right).  When compared to the first movie, both animation and story suffer.  Nevertheless, it is not really painful to watch, even after viewing the first movie.  I highly recommend this item, especially for the value, since ""The Secret of N.I.M.H."" alone costs about the same.",1168473600,2,799,4.874074074074074
8041582,5,B0006GAOS6,"I hadn't seen these movies for years and I thoroughly enjoyed watching both movies just as I did the first time I saw them.  I thank you very much for the rapid response to my purchase.  It is always a pleasure.
