3737149,2,B001P3SA9Y,"Woopak never learns...

Being a fan of Takashi Shimizu's ""JU-ON: The Grudge"" and ""JU-ON: The Grudge 2"", but never really liked their American remakes; I still thought I'd check out this 2nd ""Americanized"" sequel since I was bored and curious. Shimizu directed the first two remakes of ""Ju-On"", ""The Grudge 3"" has a different director at the helm in the person of Toby Wilkins (Splinter). Loosely based on ""Ju-On"", the film does adapt the established formulas set by the first two, with a different cast and shot in Bulgaria, released by Sam Raimi's Ghost House pictures. Well, I decided to check this out since the director is the guy who gave us ""Splinter"" which I somewhat liked. So how does ""The Grudge 3"" rate? Well, it is different but also very run-of-the-mill--it is a direct to dvd popcorn snooze.

The story takes off after the events of ""The Grudge 2"" as Jake (Matthew Knight) is the sole survivor from those events that took his family. Jake is certain that something bad will happen in the Chicago apartment where he used to live; he tries to warn his doctor (Shawnee Smith) but she never believes his warnings. That is, until Jake is broken into two. Now, Doctor Sullivan decides to look into Jake's unexplained violent death, and goes to his former apartment building. But it seems like strange things have already began to occur as people have started dying. Max (Gil McKinney), the building's super lives with his two sisters; Lisa (Johanna Braddy) and an asthma-stricken Rose (Jadie Hobson) may already be in danger. Naoko (Emi Ikehata) is a young woman from Japan, who may be able to end this curse...but at what price?

I liked ""Splinter"" which is the main reason why I gave this ""made for dvd"" movie a look. Wilkins does display competency in generating thrills in that film, and in ""The Grudge 3"", his finest moment would have to be a ""Mister Potato-head"" very creepy approach. Forget crawl spaces that looked spooky, Mr. Potato head is one creepy gimmick. Other than this, the film is pretty routine and I thought Wilkins tried to inject some nice compositions to an otherwise simple screenplay. I guess the best way to approach this film is to look at it from other direct to dvd sequels such as ""Rest Stop 2"" and ""Wrong Turn 2"", which this film is superior. Heck, this film is even better than ""The Haunting of Molly Hartley"" which saw its release in theaters. Let's make up a phrase; it is so routine, but it is fabulously routine (?).

The screenplay by Brad Keene is totally disconnected from the events of ""The Grudge 2"" although it is linked. Jake played by Knight and Doctor Sullivan (Smith) would be expected to be the film's main characters, but the film takes its focus on Max's family. There are some pleasantly creepy moments as we witness the ""Yurei"" (long-haired vengeful ghost) do the familiar scary movements and the sound of a `clicking' and 'vibrating' throat which is an ominous sign of things to come. The timing of the scares are good, although a bit too familiar. It was curious that this time around, the cinematography is brightly lit most of the time, and doesn't have that gloomy dimly lit areas, although the make up effects of our ghosts go from good to pretty darned cheap.

I suppose the cast is pretty competent. Johanna Braddy is so charming as the lead actress, and she is quite easy in the eyes. She does show some potential as an actress despite the weaknesses of the script. Now, I don't mean to go overboard, but she is full of character (as your girl next door) that she managed to get some sympathy from me. Her supporting cast is quite decent, I liked Hobson and McKinney was acceptable. Too bad Ikehata was underused, she should've gotten more screen time. I was disappointed that the ceremony wasn't fully fleshed out, I would have enjoyed a little more groundwork.

Overall, ""The Grudge 3"" isn't amazing nor would it be worth as anything more than a rental. At least it wasn't as annoying as I feared it would be. There are some freaky images that may interest fans of the franchise, and for the non-veteran horror fan it can be a diversion. The script is boring and very routine, but its energy is pretty pleasant. I suppose mediocrity can be passable when compared to some real BAD movies. Better than ""The Grudge 2"", dare I say?

Rent it [2  -Stars]
Video/Audio: 1.85 ratio anamorphic widescreen. The picture is incredibly clean and sharp. The transfer is pretty darned good. The 5.1 Dolby Digital track is clear and powerful.",1242172800,3,4495,4.688212927756654
3737150,2,B001P3SA9Y,"To be perfectly honest i'm not all that happy with this film, the first 2 were a whole lot better and more scarier. After i watched the first grudge i was unable to walk in the dark by my self for like 2 weeks. After i got over it i went and watched it again and again couldn't be alone in the dark then when it came out on dvd i bought it. Same went for the 2nd grudge. But this film well lets just say that i was waiting and waiting and waiting and again waiting to be scared out of my skin and well as it happens it didn't and im not afraid to walk alone in the dark. In my opinion this film could have done things alot different and alot better. But you know what this is just my point of view on the 3rd grudge film, others may have liked it alot better than i did. So to be honest don't listen to anyone be your own judge and base your opinion about this film your self. You never know you might like it a whole lot more than other people. Enjoy everyone.",1242172800,3,961,3.8585858585858586
3737151,4,B001P3SA9Y,"The Grudge 3 takes place where the 2nd left off with Jake now under the care of a doctor (Shawnee Smith); he keeps informing her that Kayako is still after him but she doesn't believe him (thinking he's simply disturbed from the death of his family.) We also see a new family living in the Chicago apartment building that Jake had lived in and it seems as though the curse still lingers there. It is up to Naoko, a relative of Kayako's, who has arrived from Japan to put an end to the curse.

The Grudge 3 is surprisingly effective and a fine sequel to the Grudge trilogy. There are some genuinely creepy moments and fine performances from the lead cast. It's a bit more gruesome than the previous films (now with an R-rating) and a bit more is revealed into the Grudge curse. While not a masterpiece by any means, it's a fun little horror movie. Recommended for fans of the series.",1242086400,3,882,4.411042944785276
3737152,3,B001P3SA9Y,"I was also one of the few who saw it already and to be honest, it was a big improvement over The Grudge 2. The acting's pretty decent and the story was a lot more coherent this time around. The deaths weren't all that special but they definitely stepped up in the violence department to say the least. The ghosts were more aggressive and the story gets pretty intense as we get closer to seeing if this is truly the end of Kayako and Toshio's killing spree, but when it's all said and done, I had very mixed feelings about the ending. It's an ending that can truly be interpreted in so many different ways. If this is in fact the final movie of the trilogy, then we're left with a lot to think about. Rather that's a good or a bad thing is up to you.

On the the whole, despite me seeing it early, I'm seriously buying it no matter what. It definitely wasn't a waste of my time, but it doesn't surpass the first one in any way. If you're a die hard fan like me, you'll enjoy what this film has to offer to some extent.",1233878400,24,1018,4.09

Anyhoo, it's a pretty lame. Lots of boring ""drama"" pad the minutes away. It's not filmed in an especially engrossing style like the first movie, which sucked my into the screen and made me jump. It looks like it was produced by people who might normally do lighting for TV commercials, so the creepy gray kid is not so creepy, just out of place.  At any moment, I feel like Billy Mays is going to pop out and introduce a new soap for when the kids play in the chimney ash.",1411776000,,715,4.1

3737183,5,B001P3SA9Y,I chose this rating because this movie is really scary. The first time I saw it I was on the edge of my seat. The story was written really well and the cast was great. I loved the fact that we had the back story of Tashio's mother and how that all tied the movies together. I am a fan of the movies Ju-On and Ju-On 2. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan of Japanese horror movies and horror movies in general.,1394150400,,425,3.896551724137931

3737186,2,B001P3SA9Y,"The Grudge 3 does not succeed very well at tying up the trilogy. After watching it, I felt as though it was incomplete and needed more. It has some good scares, however, and very creepy scenes to it, I can't argue with that, however the disappointment exceeded the scares on this one.",1375228800,,284,4.480769230769231
3737187,3,B001P3SA9Y,"The first two installments in this series were well done, nicely atmospheric. This one was more about the shock value, with none of the delicious creepiness. Only diehard fans should buy this one.",1370995200,,196,4.96969696969697
3737188,2,B001P3SA9Y,"The Grudge 3 is a direct sequel to the Grudge 2, as the curse now resides in the Chicago apartment building. The Grudge 3 is a mostly mediocre, occasionally creepy horror film.

The story in this film is okay. It's really nothing new or innovative as it uses the same concept, and the same scares as the original; however, this isn't a bad thing for those that aren't tired of it. It's not really a scary film. It lacks the suspense and eeriness to create a truly effective horror film. Most of the jump-scares fall flat, with the exception of two, maybe three; the ghostly imagery isn't haunting or disturbing anymore, it looks like the iconic ghosts have simply been covered in paint or dipped in milk; the croaking sounds and cat sounds are still creepy, but they were rarely used. The film does, however, utilize some vicious gore effects that visual effect fans might enjoy (I did.) The acting was okay- never spectacular, occasionally bad. The ending was also decent.

Overall, The Grudge 3 has a few decent moments/scenes, and it stays true to the Grudge formula, which is a plus for hardcore fans; the series has lost some steam, though, and this film doesn't standout nor does it ever truly terrify. As of 4/12/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming, a rental/stream is recommended, a purchase for devoted fans of the series.

The Grudge has some strong violence and gore, and some brief nudity.",1366329600,,1413,4.712550607287449
3737189,5,B001P3SA9Y,"This is not the same story as the Japanese Grudge 3. Its good, but no where near as pants wetting scary as Juon 3 is.

3737196,3,B001P3SA9Y,"Not as scary as the first two, it's mediocre. It tries, at least, unlike some horror movie sequels (like hell raiser 3 and on, or some of the Return of the Living Dead sequels). I just think its not that original anymore. The first Grudge was so unique looking the creatures and their movements were jarring and surreal. The white pasty face and twitching just doesn't do it for me anymore.",1348444800,2,390,4.507042253521127
3737197,1,B001P3SA9Y,"The movie arrived in a timely manner.  This movie turned out to be too scary for the family to watch.  A note to younger viewers,  DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE! To much of the dark side.",1347753600,,181,3.9722222222222223
3737198,1,B001P3SA9Y,"Admittedly, in my short thirty years, I've seen many terrible movies but this one stands above the rest. With precious little to do with the original franchise or plot, the story mainly details the mundane lives of a family living in and trying to help run the day to day upkeep of an apartment building. it might make a good plot for a rom-com or perhaps a typically forgettable hollywood kids movie. But no. Sadly, this plot is borrowed for a film that was supposed to take place in an entirely different country and seemingly, in total ignorance of any of the original premises which formed the story. In short: this film has almost nothing to do with any of the Grudge (or Ju On as it's originally known) films. This said, a better film to check out for those who enjoyed the first two films would be the original Japanese films Ju On and Ju On 2. You can easily locate both of them on YouTube under these exact search titles or, if you are the sort of person who (like my husband) demands nothing less than surround sound and letterbox featuring, you may be able to find both of these titles for relatively cheap on YesAsia.com (just search under the exact names given) a pretty good place that sells Asian media. In conclusion, for those who have already seen the aforementioned films, yet another film worth seeing that has recently been added to the Ju On franchise is
""Ju On: Girl in Black/Old Woman in White"". It is a fascinating film which gives another look at Japanese culture as well as a satisfying addition to the series. Again, you can find these on YouTube as well as YesAsia.com (Taiwan sells them cheapest and often, region free. Though a region free DVD player is easy to get online these days.) Lastly, don't bother with this film unless you are hankering for some utter trash that leaves you in total despair about the future of the American film industry (joke, there).",1347580800,,1893,4.55425219941349
3737199,2,B001P3SA9Y,"I felt this movie overused the ""ghost/spirit"" shots and showed the ""ghost/spirit"" too much.

3737202,4,B001P3SA9Y,"I can say that the movie focuses more on plot and details then it does scariness, but don't get me wrong, this movie had one point where it startled my mom who has been watching horror movies since she was young and never got startled like that in the past 10 years (the only other thing that scared her was ""The Shining"" when she was young).  The movie itself had a plot that branched out from the original, but still retained the original content to an extent.  I can say that if it wasn't for plot and details, they could have added in more scary moments, more thrills and still keep it to where the characters would just so that the audience can pick and choose their favorites.  The scary moments are really scary when it comes down to it, but I wasn't expecting that much gore from a movie that's more about scary than gory.  The ending was extremely predictable so I wasn't really expecting too much from the ending (There generally are 1-2 survivors in American remakes, whereas Japanese horror there's no stopping the force and therefore generally no survivors).  Other then that the movie was pretty good.  The only reason I emphasis the plot and details is because the movie has basically 8-12 scary moments, which is good for a movie, but left me and anyone else I was watching it with crave for more.  Just as a quick summary of what I said; Originals = Good, Remakes = not as good; too much plot and details to be perfectly scary, but is still pretty scary when looking at the whole thing; too typical of a movie ending (survivors, but only to an extent do they survive) to give 5/5 stars, but is too good for a 3/5 stars.",1331251200,3,1636,4.397350993377484

3737204,2,B001P3SA9Y,"I loved The Grudge and thought The Grudge 2 was pretty good, but this was just disappointing. The story continues with the Chicago apartment from the previous film (which I thought was the weakest part of the film). One cast member returns briefly and everyone else is new or is replaced by a new actor. I loved Kayako in the previous films, but didn't care for her in this film due to the new actress. The plot is pretty boring and at times I wanted to shut the movie off. The film also ends on a cliffhanger, which is likely to never get resolved. There are a couple special features which are pretty boring and a bunch of trailers for other films. I only recommend this film if you really love The Grudge series.",1312156800,,715,4.343283582089552

I enjoyed the characters and felt their fright of the unknown.  This was a great horror film.  However it does stir away from the other two plots of movie and can be confusing as to how and why.  The setting is more current and not in China and locates more in a  apartment complex of the boy  who witnessed the murder of his family and  who is having some problems  sleeping.  A great horror flick.",1301356800,3,579,4.336448598130841

3737208,3,B001P3SA9Y,"I had heard that this would be the Grudge installment that explains how the curse can be contained.  The first two films depicted something like exponential growth like a plague (each person infects a few more).  The world should have succumbed to a similar curse millennia ago if it worked that way, unless it's possible to stop it.  So, I had high hopes for a grand finale.

There were several characteristics of the earlier films that were hard for some to follow but added to the mystery (and fun) for me.
1) Moving around through time.  The viewer had to put the pieces together.  This drew me into the picture, had me feeling a need to understand the meaning of the time sequences so I could help the poor characters know how to fend off the creepy-crawlies.  In G3, it's a strictly linear time sequence.  Active thought not required.
2) Randomness of the villain.  In Japanese horror, so I've read, raw hate doesn't need a provocation to strike its target.  G3 Americanizes this with a revenge motive.
3) The exponential growth thing.  G3 tries to fudge the plots of the previous two films, depicting simply that the curse was ""reborn"" in Chicago rather than spreading there as a second outbreak location.

Last but not least, G1 and G2 had me on the edge of my seat to see how it would unfold.  (Again, the out-of-sequence depiction of time helped with that.)  G3 had me slumped way back on the couch predicting what was going to happen as much as 10 minutes in advance.

I don't share the perspective of those who had seen the Japanese version (Ju-on) first, so I really got into the first two installments; but alas, it seems the well of ideas has been used up. The Grudge has run its course, and I'm disappointed that it didn't wrap up with more of a bang.  The first two films really set the stage for a grand show-down, either containing the rapidly-spreading curse or seeing it destroy the earth.  Instead, it was a half-hearted effort as the direct-to-video marketing foretells.  If they make a Grudge 4, I will not make it a high priority to watch it.",1280793600,,2067,4.555555555555555

She travels to the haunted Chicago apartment from the sequel, to stop the curse of Kayako once and for all. The film begins in a mental hospital, where Jake Kimble (Matthew Knight) is in a cell. He complains to his doctor, Ann Sullivan (Shawnee Smith) that if she leaves him alone, then She (Kayako) will get him. Sullivan tells him that he is there for his own protection, and that he will be safe there. She apologises to him and leaves, telling him she will be back later. Jake bangs on the door, but Kayako appears behind him. Kayako's sister, Naoko Kawamata (Emi Ikehata),is a Japanese woman who hears of Jake's death in the newspaper and becomes worried. and travels to to Chicago where the last incident with Kayako occurred. She is introduced to the Chicago apartment by Max,(Gil McKinney) the landlord, and immediately she begins to feel her sister's presence in the house This was a much better film than the second film. GOOD FILM",1275264000,,1078,4.561855670103093
3737211,5,B001P3SA9Y,"The Grudge 3 tells the story about a brother and his two sisters, who live in the apartment building from ""The Grudge 2"", fighting for their lives against the menacing ghosts of Kayako and Toshio. A young Japanese woman Naoko, revealed as Kayako's sister, travels to the apartment and Dr. Ann Sullivan (Shawnee Smith) investigates also, after the death of her patient Jake, the sole survivor of the sequel.

First of all, if you've seen as many horrible DTV films I have, you'll immediately notice that The Grudge 3 is one of the better ones in terms of production values, actors, quality etc. The trailer for the film makes it look cheap, but the movie looks just as theatrical as the first two. The soundtrack is exactly the same from the first two movies, the apartment looks exactly the same from the sequel, plenty of exterior shots and a solid set of actors. This movie actually looks like it had a budget to work with, unlike recent horrible sequels ""Pulse 2"" and ""Pulse 3"".

DTV movies in general, and sequels such as ""Wrong Turn 2"", ""Joy Ride 2"", ""The Grudge 3"" etc. are definitely getting a lot better, and some of them are even better than some of the crap in theaters. If you've seen the first two, you'll also notice this is the most violent Grudge movie yet, with some bloody deaths. Kayako and Toshio have been recast, but it's not necessarily a huge issue since they are just actors in white make-up.

The acting is solid from the cast, and it was great to see Shawnee Smith (Saw I, II, III) in another horror movie. Toby Wilkins, who recently directed the very good horror movie ""Splinter"" (2008), does a great job here and is probably one of the reasons why it doesn't feel cheap and tacky. He's a talented director and does a solid job. The script is pretty good, and I loved the introduction of Kayako's sister and the twist of events at the end. It was also much smoother than ""The Grudge 2"", which could get a tad confusing at times.

Overall, The Grudge 3, in my opinion, is a solid entry to The Grudge franchise and it's one of the best DTV movies you can ask for. This movie could have easily have had horrid production values and it could have been horrible, but I actually loved it for what it was. Solid cast, solid director, good death scenes (with even more blood this time!) and it's a solid continuation to the storyline.",1274659200,4,2353,4.490654205607477
3737212,5,B001P3SA9Y,"In Chicago, the boy Jake (Matthew Knight) is interned in a mental institution and his therapist Dr. Sullivan (Shawnee Smith) does not believe that he is haunted by the ghost of the boy Toshio. When Jake is killed in his cell with all his bones broken, Dr. Sullivan decides to investigate further with open-mind. Meanwhile, Lisa (Johanna Braddy), who is the sister of the super Max (Gil McKinney) of Jake's building, steals the key of apartment 305 to have sex with her boyfriend Andy (Beau Mirchoff). When she realizes that the spot is a crime scene, she immediately returns to her apartment, where she lives with Max and their sister Rose (Jadie Hobson). In the meantime, the Japanese Naoko (Emi Ikehata) decides to travel from Tokyo to Chicago to stop the curse of her sister Kayako. She meets Lisa and tells that she needs hers and Rose's help her to stop the fiend of her sister, but Lisa does not accept the offer. When Max is possessed by the evil spirit of Daisuke (Takatsuma Mukai), Lisa visits Naoko but it may be too late to stop the curse.

""The Grudge 3"" is better and better than the second movie of the franchise. The screenplay is well-developed and the ghosts are very creepy and scary. Max recalls Jack Nicholson's character in ""The Shining"" when he is possessed. Lisa is a character quite dumb and her stupid attitude refusing to help Naoko is the weakest part of this good sequel. Now it seems that Naoko has reborn the curse, but I hope the producers stop this franchise. My vote is 5.",1274659200,2,1505,4.594795539033457
3737213,3,B001P3SA9Y,"I liked this ""episode"" of the Grudge better than the second one.  I thought the plot was a little bit more coherent.  It was less creepy, though, and more gory, which is a criticism of horror films I have about the last 20 years or so of American horror films.

Apparently, the grudge has immigrated to the United States, and this movie starts pretty much where the last one ends. Same apartment building, but this time the main characters are the three siblings, the oldest of which, Max, manages the building. Lisa, about 18, and Rose, 8, are his sisters. Kayoko and Toshio are busy killing off the tenants of the building.

Enter Dr. Sullivan, who realizes that the last survivor, Jake, who died in her care, was not a crazy little kid, but telling the trusth about a vengeful spirit boy. She visits the building and encounters the grudge.  Too late for her.

Enter Naoko, Kayako's sister, who is experiencing a guilt trip, and wants to end the curse by performing a ceremony involving Lisa and Rose. Lisa rebuffs Naoko's offer to help, but now, Max, has taken on the personality of a deranged Takeo, Kayako's husband. Lisa runs to Naoko for help, and agrees to an exorcism ceremony.  However, at the critical moment,Lisa stops the ceremony. Max comes in and eventually kills Naoko. Kayako chases Lisa and Rose goes back to the room to finish the ceremony before Lisa is killed. Max comes to his senses, but now Naoko's spirit carrys on the grudge.

The pace is pretty fast. Gil McKinney, who plays Max does a good job of morphing from nice to evil, and I really appreciated his performance. The obligatory replaying of the original murder in a new environment was also a good touch. The vengeful spirit is a theme that for me, you can't go wrong with.

Where the movie falls short is the suspension of belief required on top of what is required for a horror film. Sure, many tenants have moved out, but no one heard any of the carnage going on at the end?  Lisa asks for Naoko's help without question, they are about to get killed and then questions the methods at the last minute?

All in all, an enjoyable movie. Ignore reality (even for a horror film), don't analyze, just sit back and enjoy.",1274486400,3,2199,4.555837563451776

3737215,1,B001P3SA9Y,"There are only two good things about The Grudge 3, and here they are: 1) The excellent set design, which places you exactly back into the look and feel of the Chicago apartments even though they were actually reconstructed from the ground up in Bulgaria, and 2) Shawnee Smith (the Saw francise), because she's an amazing actress (and she's great looking!). She gives probably the best acting in the entire film, but even she can't save it from sucking. Matthew Knight reprises his role as Jake from The Grudge 2, but the absence of Sarah Michelle Gellar as Karen and Takashi Shimizu in the Director's chair doesn't lend any sense of true continuity to the Grudge series. Grudge 3 gets the first R-rating in the series. The lighting and cinematography are good, but the story line is, to say the least, a little weak.

You have the dead woman's sister who travels all the way from Tokyo to try and exorcise the curse from the Chicago apartments, as weird things have started happening to the residents. People begin to die, and the ghostly culprits are (once again) the dead mother and her cat-noise-making son, Toshio. He is gigantic in this film -- closer in fact to the size of a 12 year old tween than that of a 5 year old boy. There comes a point where all of this just isn't scary anymore. I guess it's easy to understand why this film didn't even make it to the box office. A bigger budget, better acting and a much, much stronger storyline could have saved The Grudge 3......but no.

The Grudge 3 isn't worth your time. Go and see the original Ju-On movies instead -- they're much better!",1267488000,2,1595,4.534722222222222

Somehow I just can't get freaked out by watching a Japanese boy and woman painted with white body make-up and lots of mascara around their eyes. In this terribly low-budget slice of cheese, these two figures are the only demonic monsters. I hit the reject button after the main male figure becomes possessed by an evil spirit and proceeds to stab a woman who doesn'try to escape--she just cowers and watches him come toward her with the knife.  And watching this happen is the heroine and child who also just stand and cower and weep. No one ever tries to escape the evil spirits. They merely bulge their eyes and freeze. This cheapie is so low-rent I can't see it even playing on the SyFy Channel-notorious for showing the cheesiest made for TV schlock fests on planet earth.",1267228800,2,951,4.594117647058823
3737217,5,B001P3SA9Y,"Usually Japanese sequels tend to move into really bizarre directions that take a little too much puzzle work to make any sense of. Given that this was the first Grudge movie to not have Takashi Shimizu in the director's chair, we get a fresh approach while still staying faithful to the series.

The second movie had the curse spread to Chicago by a girl who went into the original house in Japan, surviving long enough to bring it home with her. Eventually the apartment complex she lives in becomes cursed itself and anyone who enters falls victim. So in this third chapter the victims are plenty.

This movie was more of a straight forward horror flick than the previous chapters and gives us a little resolution by the end. At least now we know that there's a way to stop the curse- although most likely only for the time being.",1259280000,,832,4.54
3737218,2,B001P3SA9Y,"It goes on and on. When you think everything is over, it is not. Three years after ""The Grudge 2"" comes another sequel featuring Kayako and Toshio, Japan's answer to Jason Voorhees (sort of). The new installment is as effective as the last ""Ju-On"" entry, which, sorry, is not saying much.

It seems there is no way to stop Kayako the vengeful spirit. That's what Jake (Matthew Knight, reprising his role in ""The Grudge 2"") keeps saying in the opening of the straight-to-DVD sequel ""The Grudge 3."" Dr. Sullivan (Shawnee Smith) doesn't believe him, which, as you know, is a big mistake. Then two ghosts, Kayako and Toshio, start haunting the cursed Chicago building where some residents still remain after the terrible event described in ""The Grudge 2."" In the meanwhile, a young Japanese woman travels to America, believing that she only can stop the curses.

The third installment suffers from the predictable storytelling and bland direction. The film just follows the basic template of horror genre faithfully. There is no surprise, no originality in the script. There is no logic behind the random appearances of the pale-faced ghosts Takao and Kayako, but still you can tell when they appear and how the victims get killed. Even the ""twist"" is not really a twist.

Though unnecessary and uninspired, ""The Grudge 3"" is not totally bad. There are some nice scares and the photography and production designs are decent. The acting is acceptable. Aiko Horiuchi plays Kayako, replacing Takako Fuji (who did the same role seven times). Maybe Ms Fuji thought it's time to do something different. Aiko Horiuchi is pretty good as the creepy woman with a crackling voice though sometimes her Kayako looks like computer-generated Sadako/Tamara.

It is not a total disaster, but obviously it is time to stop. But wait, this year another two ""Ju-On"" films have been released in Japan, ""The Grudge: Girl in Black"" and ""The Grudge: Old Lady in White""....",1254700800,,1943,4.969230769230769

If you enjoyed the Grudge and Grudge 2 my guess is that you will at least like Grudge 3.

This sequel was placed in America and Japan, but filmed in Bulgaria.  A quick check on the web confirmed that labor rates are lower at this filming location than almost anywhere in the world that studio talent can be found.  Work on sets was done quickly and accurately by Bulgarian talent and where sets could not be built on time, good scouting work found on site filming locations that would do the job with a minimum of dressing.",1250467200,,791,4.36734693877551

It's basically Kayako doing what she does best, scaring the hell out of everyone and killing anyone who comes near her. The movie's not nearly as scary as the first while staying about as scary as the second as well as adding quite a bit of un-necessary gore; Kayako only makes one of her victims' bodies vanish this time around; the rest are set up as amusing tableaus a la Friday The 13th.

I was impressed with all of the acting this time around. The main character was an amazingly stupid woman but I really believed she was an amazingly stupid woman. The actress playing Rose, the young girl suffering from a completely unamed disease, was fun as anything to watch and hilarious to boot.

It was by no means an award winner but it's a nice addition to the series. MASSIVE points lost for sticking a now 14 year old Toshio in black swim trunks though. I'm no proponent for child nudity but it just looked weird.",1248652800,,1112,4.4411764705882355
3737221,3,B001P3SA9Y,"Having enjoyed The Grudge and not enjoyed its sequel, I was a little iff on viewing the third one. How much farther could they take the story of the vengeful ghosts? Requestion. How much farther could they take the story and make it work? Question's now answered.

 The answer: Not much farther. The new details in the curse's mythology were interesting, but they were never fully expanded beyond a simple explanation and a simple flashblack. I think there could have been more done there to make it a tad bit more interesting.

 There were a lot of firsts for this Grudge: the first R-rated, the first not directed by original director Takashi Shimizu, and the first to actually be scene in chronoligical order. Just like with the new mythology bits, the R rating could have been stretched farther. I thought I was simply watching a PG-13 film again. I'm not a fan of gore, but the mind's curiosity would have liked to have seen just what these ghosts could have done with the addition of some gore. Shimizu's tone and pace of the two previous entries was adequately picked up by new director Toby Wilkins, nice job. The chronological order shtick was just something I enjoyed in the previous entries. It not being here really didn't add or take away from the film.

 I do commend the casting choices. Shawnee Smith? Amazing as always, but a little underused, perhaps? The return of Matthew Knight from The Grudge 2 was a nice addition, and his scene was one of the only to use the R rating, I believe. Johanna Brady as our new lead chick was great, although her reactions were semi-blah. Gil McKinney played the underdog brother takes care of his sisters and holds the family together deal pretty well, and when his character took a turn, the transition was awesome. And I have to give props to Jadie Hobson for being a kid in a horror movie who didn't irk me to death. I actually enjoyed the kid.

 I pretty much feel on the fence about how much I did like the film. I know that it ranks above The Grudge 2. And extra creep factor? The film's twist at the end was definitely creepy. The movement there . . .",1247097600,,2110,4.505235602094241
3737222,3,B001P3SA9Y,"The series that won't die continues with a third installation. Focusing again on the building in Chicago, the survivors of Grudge 2 are picked off in quick succession. This leaves Alex and his sisters Rose and Sam alone to fight off Kayoko, until receiving a visit from Naoko, Kayoko's sister. Things quickly deteriorate in a Shining like fashion as Alex struggles with keeping the building together and his sister alive.

The scares in this iteration have drastically deteriorated, and just about all of time involve Kayoko walking or Toshio meowing annoyingly. What suspense and tension there was in the first movie has evaporated completely. There are a few tolerable moments and honest efforts to try something different, but they end up feeling like cut outs from the Ring.

The characters have regressed to pancakes, and a couple are so forgettable that you don't recognize them or care when they die. The ceremony near the end of the movie, one of the few moments where they could've made a good impression, involves too many candles and speaking in tongues. The few people who know whats going on refuse to act, of even call the cops when necessary, as giving the illusion of helping means making a decision. Cowering quietly in a corner for fifteen minutes is what is called for.

While the movie is pedantic and dull, it at least tried to keep things scary, and even tried to offer a tolerable explanation for the overall storyline. This does not do enough to paper over glaring plot holes, terrible acting, and startle scary scenes that do neither. The first Grudge managed to be scary by keeping things subtle, muted, making the scares a combination of seemingly mundane things.

Grudge 2 was the scariest ghost story I had seen on film since Stanley Kubrick's The Shining.
Where I grew up as a kid there were resident ghosts and they made me sure I'd never be alone.
This was during the days when people thought that after the body ceases to be then the person dies because they're the body which has been disproved by every means whereas serious research has been conducted.
In Iceland it was said on Grudge 1 , 'Japanese ghosts are the scariest of all ghosts'and it was done seriously and to seriously promote this movie - Grudge 1.
Grudge 2 one star reviews scare me even more. What kind of far more frightening ghost movies have those reviewers seen?
I mean for me that's that - this is serious criticism of the Grudge and I give it five stars - positive criticism.

3737224,1,B001P3SA9Y,"I came into this one with fairly high hopes, having been a fan of the previous films in the franchise, especially the original Japanese versions. I was sorely disappointed. This film has a different writer and director, and it really does show. While Shimizu uses a style where the story doesn't flow from start to finish, the new director uses a traditional beginning, middle, and end formula.

The actors who played Kayako and Toshio have been replaced, and while this isn't necessarily bad as a rule, it is here, Toshio is replaced with an actor who looks far too old for the part, and the actress for Kayako, while she looks the part well enough, just can't copy the original's creepy movement.

The special effects are lackluster to say the least. The lighting is far too bright, and doesn't set the mood that has made the Grudge what it is. The makeup is also poorly done, making Kayako and Toshio seem like something from a high school play, using flour to make them ghostly.

The plot picks up after the second movie, naturally, and is set in the apartment building seen in the second movie, the only time the original house is seen is during flashbacks. The kills are few and far between, and they're all pretty much rehashes of old kills with new victims, Kayako appearing out of paintings, instead of pictures, dragging people into bath tubs, etc. One thing that stood out, and not in a good way, was the addition of a sister for Kayako. As soon as I saw that, I almost hit stop and threw the DVD away, but then I remembered I paid about $30 for this. I remember in the special features of the previous American Grudge movies, Shimizu commenting about how the American producers were really dead set on the idea of giving Kayako a twin sister, and he thought it was an idiotic idea. Well congratulations Hollywood, you got your way. I salute you! With one finger, guess which.

If you're thinking of buying this, don't. Borrow it from a friend who was unfortunate enough to pay up for it, heck, they might even just give it to you. Unless you find it in a bargain bin somewhere, it's not worth the money, go track down a copy of Kairo instead, you'll be much more satisfied.",1244937600,4,2185,4.5240506329113925

At one point in the movie, I was pretty sure I'd been watching for at least an hour. Unfortunately only about 27 minutes had passed.

Yes, this is a painfully boring story. Far more ""dialog"" than anything else.

This 3rd installment is poorly written, poorly acted, re-visits familiar territory and adds nothing to the legacy of the first movie.

I found 2 fairly good ""scare"" moments in the film, but that's about it. The first Grudge film managed to be scary throughout by setting a tone and mood. The films since the first one have not been able to capture this eerie feeling.

Grudge 3 just doesn't work. It's not scary, the characters are uninteresting and the new pretzel ghost can't hold a candle to the original.

I found it funny that the kid ghost is now bigger, taller and has taken to wearing brown shorts. I wonder if he'll be a teenage ghost in the 4th one?

The first Grudge is a horror classic as far as I'm concerned. Although the 2nd one was not bad it did not measure up to the first. This 3rd one is a pale imitation. Enough is enough.",1244851200,3,899,4.3273809523809526
3737227,1,B001P3SA9Y,"At this point the Asian horror genre is somewhat tired due to American remakes of the Ring & The Grudge, followed by their sequels. The first Grudge came at a time when we were still intrigued by this creepy, robotic moving ghost girl which led to a decent film. The second was pretty much the same deal with a little less of a budget, a slightly weaker story, and an appearance of Kumar. Now we are brought to the third and hopefully last installment which lacks just about everything. Obviously the budget was way less since it was a straight to dvd release, the story was the same but with a few boring twists, and our scary ghost girl/brother have really lost their effect.

The story picks up kind of where the second one left off. The apartment in Chicago where our asian ghosts have caused havoc is now forcing tenants to flee leaving it close to shutting down. Max is the manager of the complex who lives there with his two younger sisters. As he desperately tries to retain and gain new tenants he winds up becoming possessed by the spirits. As his sisters lives lay in the balance between the spirits and their possessed brother they are told they must do a ceremony to end the spell.

Out of the series this by far is the worst of all. It was supremely boring with way too much dialogue. To watch the film you will have to fast forward through roughly 70 % of it or you will be fast asleep in you chair like Santa at work. Even the ghost girl and her brother were way less creepy. The way the girl would crawl around in that bizarre twitching motion has even been cut back. I guess they couldn't afford the camera function that made it appear so scary because this one didn't have it. Even their make-up was more b. It looked like they rolled the actors in some flour and threw them out on set. When this one is returned it will get the Sid patented ""He's gone, the evil's gone from here!""

3737229,3,B001P3SA9Y,"I can see why Grudge followers might be let down by this latest installment.  It's obvious right away that things have changed since Grduge 2.  New director and writer means new look, and a whole new storytelling approach.  The first act somewhat confused and bored me with all the character development and lack of scares.  Rather than keep the viewer off balance, like the first Grudge did, the approach here is standard three act American movie making, complete with an obligatory attempt to clearly explain what was going on.  The thing is, at some point during the second act, I began to care for the characters.  The downside for a ghost story is that my biggest fear up to that point in the film was that little Rose would suffer a serious asthma attack, with the ghosts seeming a less serious threat.  Fortunately by the third act, the ghost story kicks in full force and I was enjoying it for what it was:  an American tale of haunting that just happened to have the spirits from The Grudge in it.  As a stand alone work, I liked The Grudge 3 enough to give it 3 1/2 stars, but as a follow-up to Grudge 1 & 2, I found it mismatched and even misleading.  I've got to think that Shimizu would have done things much differently.",1242777600,2,1234,4.444444444444445
3737230,1,B001P3SA9Y,"After reading a few of the positive reviews, I was excited to see this movie, but after sitting through this piece of trash, I would suggest you save your money. I've seen a lot of bad movies in my life, but this movie is just plain STUPID! Every time the ghastly dead Japanese woman enters a room to attack one of the actors, the actor would fall to the ground, start crawling backwards as slowly as they possibly can, and put their hands as far away from a defensive position as possible.  All the actor would need to do is stand up, turn away from the creature-woman, and walk away, and the dead crawling woman would be left in the dust.

--- Spoiler ---

To make matters worst, every male actor in this movie acted like this was their first time in front of a camera - they were atrocious.  The best actors, the psychiatrist Sullivan (Shawnee Smith), and the tenant-friend Gretchen (Mirina Sirtis - aka Counselor Deanna Troi), are killed off early in the movie.  The other good actors are made to act stupid, causing the movie's plot to completely unravel.  Never mind, there was no plot, what was I thinking.

Save your money and buy a good movie like ""The Eye"" with Jessica Alba, and you'll be a lot more entertained, and a lot happier that you shelled out over $20 for a movie that wasn't a complete waste of time.",1242777600,3,1321,4.411522633744856
3737231,1,B001P3SA9Y,"WHY ... did they bother to create this film? That is my question.
The FIRST TWO american-version Grudge films were exemplary; not only were they faithful to and did justice to the Japanese versions, but they were a credit to the enitre horror genre, a style that in many ways has been consistently failing since the 90's. They were a much needed breath of fresh air for horror die-hards like myself, who were tired of directors sacrificing top-level dialogue, acting chops and plot outlines to pander to quick DVD sales and an industry expecting little to nothing from the Horror genre save for the endless drivel of ""Screams"" and ""I What You Did Last Thursdays...""
And this is how Grudge 3 fails in every way... not necessarily because it wasn't released theatrically; that's irrelevant. But the director, when it came to quality, should have been ""thinking"" theatrically.
And yet, this time around, we have actors who can't act, poor cinematography, a weak, rehashed plotline thats already been covered better and in greater detail in the first two films, very minimal screentime for both Kayako and Toshio compared to the first two, and when you do see them... oh.. don't get me started! The character of Toshio is a young boy, approximately 6-8 years of age, can't remember which. In 3, we have a young man who is CLEARLY way too old for the role, looking more in the 15-16 range. Do ghosts age, too? Apparently so. And Kayako, the greatest villainess of recent times in all of horrordom; replete with dark hair, faded looks and the her signature fright-inspiring stop-motion cinematography... all that of that is ruined here. Its a different actress, which albeit is not always a bad thing, but it certainly is when the new actress blatantly overacts, and is not saved by the directors cheap makeup and effects. The makeup looks very ""straight-white,"" not ""natural ghost."" Cheap. The trademark stop-motion is choppy and less smooth. And the attacks are minimal. Which means the creepiness is minimal. The only thing ""new"" is a cheap attempt at an even further backstory for Kayako and her newly introduced sister character, but even this is done tactlessly and ends up feeling very forced.
I REALLY WANTED TO LIKE THIS MOVIE! PLEASE UNDERSTAND! But I feel this new ""director"" should have left Grudge material to Sam Raimi and Takeshi Shimizu. The big guns of Horror!
If you are a die-hard like myself, go ahead... give it a whirl. Just don't expect too much.",1242691200,7,2463,4.852731591448931
3737232,3,B001P3SA9Y,"I'll admit, I liked the first American Grudge film.  It was creepy.  Once the director's cut was released the intensity of the Japanese counterparts was put back in place and we were give a decent little fright film.  The sequel, while I didn't hate it as much as everyone else, wasn't very good.  I really enjoyed the way the story was structured, which basically meant that the viewer didn't fully get was going on until the final moments.  I just thought the basic language of scares was played out and less effective with a few minor ones here and there.  Now we have The Grudge 3.  The first Grudge film not to have the original's creator in the director's chair...and it shows.

This film has the same problems as the second one in that the scare tactics are all used up and it's not particularly frightening anymore.  Though, there is one area, Marina Sirtis' death, that has a very creative arrival of the evil spirit through a painting.

The acting goes back and forth.  Some is very capable, and some is awful.  The actor playing the brother is just too timid and not very good.  The sisters young and old are both very believable.  There's one no-name actor who plays the apartment complex owner and he is the pits.  He sucks the air out of the two very brief scenes he has.  It's laughable.  Current reigning scream queen Shawnee Smith shows up briefly and does a decent job, which is good considering she has so little to work with.  I mentioned Marina Sirtis, and her role in this film could be better classified as an odd cameo.  She looks weather beaten and more croney then I recall her looking back in 2002's Star Trek: Nemesis.

The plot picks up directly after The Grudge 2, takes place in the same Chicago apartment complex, so we lose any prospects of new or interesting locations.  Already in boring sequel town.  The film is done in sequence unlike the previous and this shows the Grudge films for what they are: derivative ghost stories that are as predictable as they are cliche'd.  The lighting is too bright as well.  There's no mood, at least not a scary mood.  It's lit like a Lifetime movie.

There's some decent twists in the third act that expand the mythos, but they're written fairly ham-fisted and certainly rushed.  The script and the cinematography are the main offenders in this sequel.  It's well made and most of the actors do good jobs, if nothing exceptional.  Our lead actress does garner our care and sympathy.  The director is the same man behind the far superior and totally neglected monster movie Splinter.  I suggest buying or renting that one first, before Hollywood totally steers the man in the wrong direction and we forget why he was given more job offers to begin with.

A decent rental.",1242259200,3,2743,4.603305785123967
