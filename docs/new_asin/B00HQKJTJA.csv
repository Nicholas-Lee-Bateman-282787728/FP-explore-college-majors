8634358,5,B00HQKJTJA,"I normally don't write reviews, but wanted to comment as there are only a few reviews for this wonderful film.
Bottom line, this is worth watching....and re-watching.

As I myself am a middle aged man working through the Kyu ranks of Shotokan, I relate to this documentary and to David.
This is entertaining and inspirational and has become one of the few films I re-watch from time to time.
Highly recommended to any martial artist.",1490400000,,433,4.773333333333333

8634361,5,B00HQKJTJA,"This documentary was done pretty well. Mr. Liban did a pretty thorough job explaining the process and more importantly the character the the martial arts instills in the student, even if that  wasn't the initial reason for starting. Good film, well worth it.",1398211200,,258,5.0

Despite a successful career and a loving family, at 46, David Liban was depressed. He had few, if any, interests outside of his family and work, and with the big five-o fast approaching, he felt almost trapped in his own skin.

So, what does any self respecting adult do when they see a mid-life crisis approaching? Do they buy themselves a Porsche? Nope. Do they find a young lover? Nope! A change of career? Not a chance! They take up Karate, of course!

David shares his very personal story of his journey towards the coveted black belt, through the eyes of a Husband, Father and Karateka. We pick up his story mid-way through the kyu grades and watch as he struggles with his fitness in the dojo.

We see the number of hours and his dedication to his art, represented by pebbles in a jar  each stone representing an hours training.

In this movie we see the guilt of creating a karate-widow of his wife and the impact on his family life, balanced delicately against the personal benefits enjoyed from regular training.

We see Liban-San putting in those extra hours, training in his basement. We see him seeking advice from his Sensei (Gary Swain, no less) an.

This all builds up our investment in David as a character, and the movie makes us want him to succeed! Like most of us, David starts to make a few new friends through the dojo, and these often become (well, they did for me) life-long friendships stronger even than the relationships we have with some of our real relatives!

He wants to drop a few pounds to improve his performance and stamina in the dojo, and he turns to professionals to get help  we see his progress from a fly on the wall perspective in both his gym work and the medical supervision he receives.

We get to travel around Colorado with David as his kyu and dan gradings are shared with the audience, and all this is interspersed with interviews with, and comments from, a very impressive cast of karateka, including Gary Swain, Chris Wilder, David Jones, and many other famous names from Shotokan Karate including ISKF Chief Instructor and 10th Dan, Sensei Teruyuki Okazaki.

I loved this movie. It could easily have been my story, and if I hadnt already returned to karate after a long (23 years) break, this movie would, I am sure, have been the kick in the ass I needed to get me back to a dojo. Sensei Gary Swain puts a perspective on what karate is in the movie when he says:

If I thought that all I was doing was teaching people to kick and punch, Id quit tomorrow. Thats teaching violence; I don't want to teach violence. Karate is a method of honing the body and the mind so you can use it to protect yourself.
- Gary Swain, ISKF 7th Dan.

So, I give this movie the traditional two-thumbs up and I think, if you're at my website, that youd like it too.

Anyone involved in Karate would enjoy this movie, and we at DojoDiary agree with Black Belt Magazine; it really is A Wonderful Movie.
