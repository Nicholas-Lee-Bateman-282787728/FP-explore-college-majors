8454655,5,B0052WNHMY,"The title of really smokin' blues DVD needs a bit of explanation. In 1971 a team of blues fans, who just happened to be cameramen for television westerns (yes, Including CBS' ""Gunsmoke""), had a few days off and headed to Eugene, Oregon to catch  - and film - the all-star blues tour headed by Muddy Waters with Big Mama Thornton, Big Joe Turner and the lesser-known George ""Harmonica"" Smith. They captured the concert on 16 mm film (so don't expect hi-def here) and, just as important, got to travel in the car with Water, Thornton and Turner.

In 2004 this material was compiled by producer Toby Byron (who made the wonderful ""Masters of American Music"" series for PBS) and it was released by Universal on DVD. (This reissue was licensed by S'more Entertainment - a new reissue company founded by former Rhino exec Arny Schorr).

There is so much fun packed into the 5 inch disc - but would need to keep your remote handy to get to much of it. The basic 53 minute ""feature"" contains two songs each by Thornton (including her composition ""Ball & Chain"" which Janis Joplin made famous), Smith (a smokin' version of ""Juke"") and Turner (including his hit of ""Sjake Rattle & Roll), with the ""headliner"" Waters getting four songs before the all come out to introduce each other. Between a few of the performance we get scenes of the performers traveling in the card - no big tour buses at this stage in their career - and they get loose drinking whiskey right from the bottle and telling stories. (The ""bonus section"" includes Thornton discussing Elvis and ""Hound Dog"" (which SHE recorded in 1953) and a few stories from Turner. Also in the Bonus section are two compete performances each by Thornton and Waters (total time 24 minutes), and two audio only tracks from Turner and Smith. The bonus interviews last about 5 minutes.

The audience in 1971 looks like the folks that would attend a Joplin concert and the even the band backing all but Waters (his Blues Band backs him) look much like Big Brother and the Holding Company.

With the performances (Thornton still played a mean blues harp) and the filmed conversations in the car, this DVD is a must for blues fans and I'm glad that S'more decided to give it another release.
