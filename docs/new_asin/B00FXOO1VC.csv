6036149,4,B00FXOO1VC,"Slow pacing may turn you off, but persevere through to the end, you won't be sorry. If you like strange and twisted movies you'll like this. Strong acting from the young female cast members, the male actors seem to be a little too over the top. Better than most of the horror shlock they are peddling these days, based on atmosphere, suspense, and plot rather than gore factor and sudden special effects shocks. A chilling and truly creepy story that stays with you.",1388448000,,466,4.626506024096385

6036154,4,B00FXOO1VC,"I almost didn't watch this due to the negative reviews.  I don't think they were deserved, however.
The filming was beautifully done.  This is the kind of horror I like....suspense with just the right amount of gore.  I had read about the movie this was remade from, so I thought I knew how it would end.  I was wrong.  I was NOT expecting what actually happened, and I can't help but wonder where it went from there.  This movie was FAR from boring.  I've never reviewed a movie on Amazon before, but given the limited reviews and the negative rating from some reviewers, I felt compelled to do so.
There are more surprises in store than the last one, though the last was definitely the biggest.  If you are a fan of lamb, you might not be after this.",1387756800,6,752,4.359712230215828

However, the actual story is not very good or scary in my opinion. The movie is weird and nothing really happens until the end of the film. The final act isn't that surprising or a reason to buy the movie as other people have said.

She'll go far & I can't wait to see if her range of characters expands although this movie was surely difficult for both young ladies to play, they both pulled it off.
As did the father figure, absolutely wonderful performance.  There is a BIG surprise ending that will BLOW YOUR MIND!  Best put this one on your list of movies to watch during the holidays.  I'm glad I took a chance on this one - well worth the rental price.",1387324800,7,705,4.737704918032787

6036163,3,B00FXOO1VC,"While this movie is very slow and very predictable, those two things don't neccessarily make for a bad movie. There is a lot of mood here and some really nice performances.

This movie is light on the on-camera violence and tries to play up the psychological aspect of the story but ultimately I feel like the film makers did not have a great understanding on how to make the movie feel tense. It suffers greatly from this lack of tension, because setting and mood can only take a movie so far.

Apart from that there were also a few scenes that went just past the line of ridiculousness for me as well. The ""instense reading books"" part and the ending became a little goofy after a while, especially the end. Without spoiling it there is an attack at the end that keeps going on, pausing, then going on so much it begins to feel like a comedy routine.

The beginning of this movie has so much mystery to it that the rest never holds up in comparison. But it is still probably worth a watch if you don't mind a very slowly paced movie.",1477440000,2,1035,4.324742268041237
6036164,5,B00FXOO1VC,"All of our families have traditions. In my family, we always eat cake at Thanksgiving, even though we know pie is more typical. By eating cake at Thanksgiving, we all have a few laughs and then bond together as a family.

Well, let's just say (without spoiling the movie) that the family in this film also has some eating practices that bring the together. They have deep traditions, in fact, and everyone gets involved. Mom not so much anymore, because she bleeds out in the first 5 minutes of the movie, but everyone else? Yes, they love to eat special things together. And it's created quite a bond between them.

I'm not that into horror movies, but this one was totally compelling for me. I was disturbed by it, I'm not going to lie. But it really got me thinking about family traditions, what brings us together, and jus a little bit about these weird neighbors of mine who seem a little bit too much like the people in this movie.

6036174,4,B00FXOO1VC,"Horror movies about cannibals have been a staple since Tobe Hooper took a big bite out of the genre with 1974's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre. That micro-budget indie set the basic pattern for a score of sequels, remakes, and imitations: An inbred, monosyllabic sub-Mensa family - with a penchant for making masks and lampshades with human skin - trap, kill, and cook unwitting teenagers.

The Silence of the Lambs gave us an articulate, Euro-suave gourmand cannibal, but served up pretty much the same stew.

There's nothing formulaic about We Are What We Are, a brilliant, deeply disturbing religious allegory about an otherwise normal family in rural, upstate New York who subscribe to a generations-old belief that they will die if they don't consume human flesh.

Loosely adapted from Mexican director Jorge Michel Grau's stunning 2010 shocker, We Are What We Are is the third feature from indie wunderkind Jim Mickle, who breathed new life into the vampire genre with 2010's equally riveting, innovative Stake Land.

An American Gothic yarn about the power of tradition, ritual, and sacrifice to bind a clan together, We Are What We Are doesn't waste time with cheap scares. Mickle keeps his story on a steady, slow simmer, transporting us minute by minute into the very heart of dread.

Ambyr Childers (Tee Master) and Julia Garner (Martha Marcy May Marlene) give deeply moving performances as teenage sisters Iris and Rose Parker, who find themselves the heads of the family when their mother is accidentally killed in a violent storm.

Their father, Frank (Bill Sage), expects them to take up their mother's mantle and initiate their clan's generations-old ritual of preparing, sacrificing, and consuming another human being. Frank may be the enforcer who reminds the girls of the strictures of their strange covenant with the universe, but he's powerless to perform the ritualized killing himself: It's always been the matriarch's role.

Kill Bill's Michael Parks has a strong turn as Doc Barrow, who begins to investigate the family when his autopsy of the mother reveals a shocking secret.

Perhaps the most frightening aspect of Mickle's film is that it elicits sympathy for Iris and Rose's singularly melancholy family.

Shot in an area of New York state that still bears the scars of Hurricane Irene, and fortified by amazing sound design and an exquisite eye for visual rhyme and rhythm, We Are What We Are is suffused by an eerie, biblical atmosphere.

It evokes such terrifying scenes as Noah's Flood, Moses' sublime confrontation with God, and Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac, reminding us that the sacred can manifest itself as a voracious monster.",1447891200,,2663,5.11520737327189
6036175,4,B00FXOO1VC,"Wonderful, atmospheric film. I wish it had gone a little more into the reason why the family continued their flesh-eating tradition. The origin of it makes sense, but why continue?
The last 15 minutes degenerated into tedium, though there is a dinner-time shocker (understandable, since there's been a week-long religious fast).
I liked the film, though gore-and-action types won't. I wish it had gone more into the history.
And seriously, Kuru? CJD would have been a more likely diagnosis, especially in a rural New York town cut off from the rest of the world due to natural disasters.

6036179,4,B00FXOO1VC,"There's a rule in the dramatic arts that two things are equally important: what one says, and what one doesn't say.

The makers here follow this rule conspicuously, until the final moments; then it's as if they can no longer help themselves.

This film is about what it's like to live inside a nightmare. It starts in bad weather. A woman dies. The local doctor misdiagnoses
her disease. The technical aspects carry us along inside the dream until there is a change in tone, a sort of misstep, which allows
us to wake up. Part of this has to do with what they have the local doctor, whose daughter has gone missing, say at the end.
Part of it has to do with what they have him do (or fail to do), falling back on formulaic methods. His characterization falls apart
a little.

Wisely, there are no dream sequences, which would undermine the dreaminess of the main narrative.

There is a flashback sequence which establishes ""what we are"" as historical. A family tradition from the 19th century. It seems
to disrupt the main narrative. Maybe it could have gone at the beginning, and been gotten over with. The girls could still read
to us from the book.

One should see this for its many good points. The remarkable acting by the young people. The tight storyline. Pared down scant dialogue. The washed out bloodless look to the thing. Haunting music. All-in-all a sort of minimalist masterpiece. But not without
flaws.

One doesn't like to quibble, but I would have gone for the whole enchilada, by staying the course.

Not so young viewers will recognize Kelly McGillis of Witness fame as the neighbor woman, as well as Michael Parks as the
doctor.",1436918400,,1648,4.642611683848798

6036187,1,B00FXOO1VC,"A ponderous pantomime of the poison of paternalism, with Bad Daddy vs. Good Daddy facing off at the end (if they'd only had an actual Cage-Travolta-Lecter ""Face Off""!). I've yet to see the 2010 orginal Mexican film of the same name, but I'm afraid this funereal hootenanny may have put me off that indefinitely.

About two daughters caught in the undertow of reigious and familial misfires, this is a picture of testosterone in aspic, that leaves one desparate for an imaginative treatment, a risque ritual of rebellion that the girls could have exercised against their father. Instead were lured into the promise of a taboo tale, of grand guignol, of a genre grotesque, of which we get absolutely none. Canibalism has never been so tame! Borrowing heavily from more lurid genre spectacle, WAWWE features a family dinner of flesh, much the same as the infamous scene from 1975s The Rocky Horror Picture Show, minus the wit and the gross-out factor. It also contains a flooded pool of muddy human bone fragments like the scene in 1982s Poltergeist, again, without the menace and the hysterics.

Its obvious the co-writer and director Jim Mickle is disdainful of the demands of the horror genre, so he immediately shows his hand: in the first few frames we get a meat grinder and a missing girl posterhe wants the audience to know whats going on so they can concentrate on the turgid roll out of on-the-nose arthouse dialogue that tells us whats transpiring and how we should feel about it, instead of showing the themes in suspensful visuals. Compare this to a current film in theatres and VOD that explores the same subject of obectified fatherhood, Foxcatcher, whose paralyzing portrait of mens obsession with paternity is a dread-soaked affair that leaves you squirming in your seat, even though you also know what happens at the end before sitting down to watch it (its a famous crime story).

Along with the equally idiotic Tusk, this is the second bomb for the great character actor Michael Parks in as many years. He always outshines any material hes in. Parks is so comfortable on screen and so mesmerizing to watch that he dwarfs all the other actors. Check out a 90s TV Movie, The China Lake Murders, on Netflix for an absolutely riveting performance by him in a better caper about a pyschopathetic serail-killer cop.

The cannibal genres offerings have been meager in the last couple of decades, save for Eli Roth's ingenious cannibal film, The Green Inferno, which is everything WAWWA is not: ritual as fetish, blackly humorous and anthropologically insensitive!

6036197,4,B00FXOO1VC,"We Are What We Are (Jim Mickle, 2013)

Less than a minute into Jim Mickle's reimaginingone cannot call it a remake with a straight faceof Jorge Grau's fine 2010 film Somos lo que Hay, he has already made it plain to the viewer who has seen the previous film that We Are What We Are is a different movie indeed. The two movies start with the same event; the death of the head of a family. While that death is never explained in the 2010 film (the family gets a visit from the coroner about two-thirds of the way through this version with a cause of death, not that it matters), the two of them are virtually identical in the method in which each family member dies; it starts with a nosebleed, descends quickly into convulsions, and within seconds that person has shuffled off this mortal coil. It is the circumstances surrounding the two deaths that make all the difference. When Papa does in the 2010 film, he is in a large city. He is surrounded by people, yet he is utterly alone and anonymous. (One of the movie's finest, funniest, blackest scenes is the revelation of what happens to him after his death, which takes place in the following minute or so.) In the 2013 film, Emma Parker (Evil Dead II's Kassie DePaiva) is trying to beat a coming storm in a small backwoods town somewhere in Appalachia, frantically grabbing groceries, but still managing to have time to have a conversation with the clerk at the general store. (Yes, this town is small enough to still have a general store.) In the space of a couple of minutes, Jim Mickle has changed the sex of the dying parent and the type of city in which the family lives. This should be creating a string of what if?s in the head of any viewer who has seen the original movie. It is to Jim Mickle (Mulberry St.)'s credit that instead of doing this and then trying to shoehorn the rest of the movie into remake territory, he gives us, essentially, an entirely new film based on those what if?s. And it is a good one indeed, Jim Mickle's best film to date.

After Emma's death, her husband Frank (Mysterious Skin's Bill Sage), is distraught enough that his daughters, Iris (The Master's Ambyr Childers) and Rose (Martha Marcy May Marlene's Julia Garner), have to step up and take charge. Well, that's the way it looks at first, but here's where those amazing what-ifs start cascading; Emma and her family, it seems, are from a long line that stems from an entirely matriarchal culture, and so Frank is stuck playing second fiddle and, occasionally, enforcer. This is especially the case when the girls' younger brother Rory (Every Secret Thing's Jack Gore in his screen debut) starts to get close to Marge (Top Gun's Kelly McGillis), their nearest neighbor, and the friendship between the two threatens to expose the Parkers' long-held secrets.

Perhaps the biggest change to the original film is when those secrets are revealed. They become obvious in the original film not long after the two children (sons in that one) are forced to take over the family; here, they are held back longer, turned into a Big Reveal(TM). This could be because I've seen the original and am a fan of it, but I didn't think the skeletons in the family's closet were really as big a deal as that would lead one to think; in many ways, that seems to me the weakest link in this otherwise very good film. I hesitate to say that this is the best way to remake a movie, but it is certainly a far sight better than the vast majority of remakes that have been coming out of Hollywood for the past ten or so years. Imaginations ran wild when Mickle and longtime partner in crime Nick Damici were putting this script together, and most everything falls into place pretty nicely; those pieces that had to be forced or shimmed are minor, really, and We Are What We Are is a worthy descendant of the original film that manages to blaze its own trail successfully. *** ",1406505600,,3893,4.533428165007113

The cinematography is good and the cast brought more to the table than was inherent in their roles as written in the screenplay. Character motivation and background were completely missing. The father's religious fervor didn't ring true - probably because the writers never outlined his tenets. He prays and insists on a weekend long fast but that's about it. As an audience, are we supposed to believe that the ""missing persons"" plot element has been going on in this small town for years without anyone falling under suspicion? The script just isn't strong enough to justify the 105 minute running time. The first time I tried to watch it I turned it off after 20 minutes.

It is another take on the cannibalism sub-genre of horror movies. If you liked the 1999 movie Ravenous I think you will like this one too as there are some similar plot sequences. The acting is rather good, and from what I can tell the blu ray transfer looks very nice also. At first I was going to give it four stars, but then I reconsidered and bumped it up to five stars. Well, a couple reasons include that it is not a so called ""found footage"" film which has really worn thin, and it's not in 3D which is tiresome too. I would much prefer to watch a well-made little horror film in the more traditional sense. There is a good amount of ""gore"" I have to say, but you might expect that in a film about cannibalism. Another movie it sort of reminds me of in the way the father is being the ""role model"" for the children is Bill Paxton's film Frailty.

6036204,3,B00FXOO1VC,"This sort of plot has been run before. The directing is what raises this outing above the fray.

Here's the scoop. Frank Parker's ancestors came to the new world in the late 18th century. It was tough going and the harsh winter made it tougher so they needed to alter their diet. They twisted the Christian religion to rationalize said diet and wrote a new ""family"" bible. Now, generations later, Frank's wife has died due to Kuru disease brought on by the odd form of nutrition. Now the family, and their ways, begins to unravel.

This is a deliberately paced flick. Some might consider it too slow but I liked it. The performances, particularly that of Michael Parks, are all really good. The two sisters, though not long in the business, seem comfortable in front of the camera. I liked the way the plot points were meted out and began to add up. The climax got a bit clunky. I believed what had to happen. I just didn't believe the way they tried to pull it off. The music also worked well with everything. But here, the director shines. You see from the opening frames that he's in for the long haul and not the quick kill. He pays good attention to the landscape so the viewer gets a good sense of place. I liked his previous ""Stake Land."" and his upcoming ""Cold in July"" is getting a good buzz. I hope to see more of him.

I'm going to assume that anyone who is interested in this movie understands what the general theme is.  For those of you who don't, cannibalism is involved.  So if that isn't what you're looking for in a horror film, you might want to look elsewhere.

While this remake of a 2010 Mexican film certainly qualifies as a horror film, there are no traditional ""jump out"" scenes and limited gore.  The horror is the subject matter and how 2 young sisters, forced by tradition, have to carry out what they believe to be long standing family values.  Director Jim Mickle certainly has a handle on drama and horror or to be more precise, suspense.  It builds ever so slowly after the Parker family matriarch (Kassie DePaiva) dies mysteriously after fainting and hitting her head on a pipe.  She falls into a partially water filled ditch and eventually drowns.

Set in upstate New York, a driving rainstorm causes flooding in the area.  This manages to dislodge suspicious artifacts which begin to wash up on a creek bed.  Discovered by the local coroner, Doc Barrow (a very good Michael Parks), wonders if they might be clues to the mysterious disappearance of numerous individuals, including his own daughter, over the years.  An autopsy of Mrs. Parker provides more clues.

After Mrs. Parker is put to rest, patriarch Frank Parker confronts his two daughters.  Iris (Ambyr Childers) is about 16 or 17 and as the oldest must be the chief chef as it were.  Younger sister Rose (Julia Garner) is about 14 and takes responsibility for rearing younger brother Rory (Jack Gore).  A neighbor, Marge offers to assist Frank but he puts her off.  I didn't even recognize Kelly McGillis as Marge.  Many horror-schlock fans may not be happy with the pace of the movie and a lack of gore throughout, but patience has its virtue.  Others, settling in for a white-knuckled suspense drama, may be unhappy with the conclusion.  It took me a day or two to think about it, but I concluded the final scenes are just about perfect.

The Blu ray disc comes in a 1080p video resolution and a 2.39:1 aspect ratio.  While I noticed a brief bit of video noise, the film looks good overall.  It appears the director and cinematographer purposely wanted a dull color grading.  Some of which is due to the bleak home setting and the constant rainfall.  The audio comes in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1.  I thought the sound effects were excellent in this film.  The constant rain changes from a light drizzle to modestly dense rain to a raging storm.  The surrounds are well utilized and the dialog properly centered.  Subtitles are limited to English SDH in this Region A disc.  Extras include a commentary track with the director, screenwriter Nick Damici and some of the actors, a 55 minute ""making of"" feature, a trailer and some interviews with the director, Sage and Garner.",1398643200,3,2863,4.748478701825558

While WE ARE WHAT WE ARE is not just a constant schlock-fest, there is some pretty disturbing stuff here: Short but graphic scenes of an autopsy, etc.

There's been some debate about whether or not WAWWA is really a horror film, and I would vote a definite ""yea"" even though the whole mood and atmosphere are different (and better in many ways) than most contemporary horror flicks. There are some elements of suspense, but you know the big ""secret"" before it's halfway through--the cover also gives a decent hint--so it doesn't exactly work as a mystery. Regardless, the brief flashbacks to the family's ancestors in the 1780s add a great deal.

Though none of the individual elements here are anything that hasn't been done plenty of times before, WAWWA's whole combination of qualities make it a different experience. It's obviously low budget but still far from being another super-amateurish cheapie. The makers of this film did an excellent job with what they had to work with. There are some blank spots--e.g., the body in the water--and a little stronger sense of place would have been nice.

6036221,3,B00FXOO1VC,"There is very little mystery in what's going on with the Parker family in WE ARE WHAT WE ARE (2013).  It's clear from the start that their nasty little secret has to do with murder and cannibalism.  Family patriarch Frank Parker (Bill Sage) is bringing up his daughters - Iris (Ambyr Childers) and Rose (Julia Garner) - to follow family traditions outlined in an ancient book dating back hundreds of years, traditions that have taken on religious overtones.  The Parkers are celebrating a communion of sorts, a sharing of ""bread"" as an homage to God and a purification of the soul.  Of course the ""bread"" isn't really bread.  We know what it is, even before the film spells it out.  And director Adam Wingard manages to make a close-up of someone eating a bite of stew seem grotesquely squirm-inducing.

WE ARE WHAT WE ARE is a very strange film, reminding me a bit of  DOGTOOTH (2011).  Both films are about weird families with weird practices, suggesting that there can be true horror in so-called ""family dynamics.""  Wingard instills WE ARE WHAT WE ARE with a dreary, sloggy moodiness that permeates every scene.  Rain becomes a virtual character here, dripping into every frame.  In fact, it's the rain that threatens to unravel the Parker family's secrets, as bones from their many communion suppers begin to float downstream, causing a local deputy (Wyatt Russell) and the town doctor (Michael Parks) to get suspicious.  The doctor's daughter disappeared a few years ago, and he can't help but wonder if the weird Parker family is somehow behind it.  The best moment of the film comes when the doctor confronts Frank Parker, asking, ""Did you eat my daughter?""  Great line, that one!

In some ways, however, WE ARE WHAT WE ARE is a bit too slow, too dreary, and too weird.  I never really bought the Parker family's religious beliefs - from the start, Iris and Rose seemed uncomfortable with their father's practices.  These are teenage girls who want what all teenage girls want - to be normal!  When their mother dies at the start of the film, it falls to Iris to take over the role of family butcher, but it's a role she has little stomach for.  For much of the film, Iris and her sister are strangely detached from both their father's commitment to ritual cannibalism and the community in which their live.  Their faces are wide-eyed and vacant, and they both seem visibly nauseated by the grotesque bowls of stew they are forced to serve and consume.

Which makes what happens at the end (the promised ""shocking"" twist) rather difficult to swallow.  The film's final act ramps up the gore, but what Iris and Rose do makes very little sense.  The audience gets its gross-out moment, but at the expense of logic and believability.  Iris and Rose simply wouldn't do what they end up doing.  But Wingard doesn't care about logic and believability - he's after a certain horrific image that he hopes will linger long after the film's credits role.  And he pretty much gets that, even though the image seems oddly disconnected from everything else that happens in the film.

WE ARE WHAT WE ARE isn't a bad film, but neither is it particularly original or compelling.  The X-Files did an episode back in 1995 on a similar theme (""Our Town,"" focusing on cannibalism and Prion disease).  There are few surprises here, at least few surprises that make sense.  I appreciated the performances (Sage, Childers, and Parks especially), and the bleak moodiness of the film is nicely done.  But I can't say it was an enjoyable or exciting experience.  I wouldn't want to watch it a second time.",1394496000,,3587,4.74313408723748

The father, Frank Parker, rules the family consisting of teenage daughters Rose and Iris, and young son Rory, with a puritanical dedication to his familys legacy.  That legacy, dating back to the 1700s, includes the murder and consuming the body of their victim in an annual feast just as any other family would celebrate Thanksgiving.

When Franks wife passes away, the responsibly of assisting him with killing the victims now falls to eldest daughter Iris.  But she and Rose are hesitant, desiring only to be normal teenagers. As they prepare themselves for their ghoulish feast, the local doctor begins unraveling the clues that will reveal their cannibalistic legacy and lead him to discover what happened to his own daughter who went missing.

We Are What We Are is a slow moving film and despite its subject matter it is extremely light on blood and gore.  The film was directed by Jim Mickle who directed the excellent 2010 vampire film Stake Land.  Like that film, this one also relies heavily on characterization and atmosphere.  To that end he employs much of the same cast and crew including actors Kelly McGillis and Nick Damici, Cinematographer Ryan Samul, and composer Jeff Grace.  The film has the same somber and often gloomy tone as Stake Land.  The killing and eating of the body isn't done for gruesome effect but rather as a reluctant but respectful almost religious observance of a family tradition.  Thus the film never becomes over the top.  Might be too slow moving for some horror fans and runs a tad too long but all in all and interesting and very different type of horror film.",1390608000,3,1704,4.837931034482758
6036236,5,B00FXOO1VC,"* spoilers *

The Parkers live in a small, rural town and have always kept to themselves. Their neighbors find them a bit odd, but good, wholesome people with Christian values. Frank, the patriarch of the family, rules with an iron fist, forcing the family to keep with their ancestral traditions at all cost. The mother has died recently, leaving the two oldest girls Rose and Iris to assume her responsibilities in the family and these traditions. The time for the gruesome ritual is upon them and unfortunately coincides with the worst storm they've seen in years. Due to the torrential downpour, clues of their previous rituals are being uncovered by local police and it seems only a matter of time until the family and their unorthodox practices will be discovered.

The Parker family appears to be wholesome, good, and pious, but their family dynamic and cannibalistic religious practices are warped and bizarre. The film boils down to the old trying to unsuccessfully stifle and combat the young. Frank Parker is the driving force of their family. Although physically imposing, he is actually weakened by a prion disease contracted from his highly regarded ritual of eating human flesh and is prone to tremors and mental deterioration. He forces his own beliefs and sensibilities onto his children, which are an amalgamation of his ancestor's traditions and Christianity. In the 1700s, their ancestors were stuck in a cave and subsisted on human flesh to survive. Frank is somehow convinced that their family will die out if they don't continue this bizarre tradition exactly how it was done in the past, so they kill and eat one young women a year. Frank represents an old order literally consuming and basically enslaving the unwilling new order, mostly comprised of young women.

Rose and Iris are Frank's teenage daughters who are obviously less than enthused about continuing Frank's traditions, but reluctantly follow his leadership. They appear much younger than they are because of the old fashioned, very modest clothes they are forced to wear. Iris also has her hair styled in severe braids to represent Frank's control over them. When they have to kill, gut, and prepare a young woman for their meal, they express disgust, reluctance, and vow to figure out a way out of it for next year. Iris is the older of the two and seems to resign herself unhappily to assume her mother's role in the home and in the ritual. She comports herself as largely silent and stoic, almost zombie-like. When a young deputy expresses interest in her, she quickly shuts him down. Iris wants more out of life and already rejects the insane teachings and authority of her father, but sees no way out of it.

Then the young conflict with the old until one is overthrown. Iris' rebellion starts by having sex with the young deputy who she previously rejected. This act is a natural expression of sexuality and appropriate for her age. Her father finds them mid-coitus and slaughters the man while he's on top of her in an effort to bury her burgeoning womanhood and keep her complacent and childlike. Rose's rebellion is represented by her hair. After she rejects the tradition and plans to leave, she stops braiding her hair, leaving it wavy and free. This changes her appearance drastically and gives her more womanly, modern look. Rose and Iris' final rebellion is in their own version of the ritual. Their father tries to kill them and commit suicide when it's obvious that others know their secret. To protect themselves and their little brother, Iris and Rose attack their father using only their teeth and nails and devour his flesh. In stark contrast to their tradition ritual, they attack and eat with savage fervor, acting on instincts rather than thought. Eating their father is getting rid of the diseased old ways and restoring the natural order, giving themselves the opportunity to move forward and have their own lives. Afterwards, they are free and wear modern clothing while they look to build a new life somewhere else. Iris takes the book with their traditions because it's undeniably part of them, but not to continue honoring them.

We Are What We Are is a well done horror film with a lot going on under the surface. It goes a different direction than one would expect of a cannibal film. The performances are excellent, especially of Ambyr Childers and Julie Garner as Iris and Rose. I like the pacing of the film and how it methodically tells the story without rushing. The ominous atmosphere of the stormy small town in built and maintained. This film is surprisingly a remake from a 2010 film of the same name set in Mexico. The two films seem to have the same general story line, but not much else in common.

6036239,4,B00FXOO1VC,"WAWWA for short is unlike any movie in this genre that I have seen in a very long time and I mean this in a good way! If you are looking for a fast paced blood and guts slasher flick you will be better served looking elsewhere. If you are looking for teen sex, drugs and rock ""n"" roll look elsewhere too!
This is a slow paced ""let it simmer"" kind of movie that gets to the meat and potatoes of who and what the Parker family is and tells the story of their history in parts through a narrative from their families journal.

The story revolves around a family of five deeply religious (mom, dad, 2 daughters and 1 young son) living deep in the South (I believe) who are barely scraping by. The story starts with the loss of the mother and the eldest daughter is ordered to take her mothers place the families hierarcy. This will play a crucial role in the story as it progresses.

The town's coroner (Parks) is plagued with guilt from the loss of his missing daughter and his quest for answers leads him on the trail of???

The towns sheriff is dismissive of the doc's ideas and has more important things to worry about like the severe weather and a missing girl.

This should give you a good idea of the story without giving to much away to see if its your ""cup of tea"" kind of movie.

Now for the production side of the movie. The direction and cinematography are top notch for this genre as is the casting, locations, and the acting.  There is no CGI and the special effects are kept to a minimum, but what there is is well done.
For me if this movie suffers from anything it might be the pacing and the writing, but neither detract to much from this movie as presented.

Rating ) to 5 stars

Story = 3.8 It could of had more suspense and a little better pacing.
Direction = 3.8 The director could have injected more suspense and fear.
Acting = 4 The cast do a great job of telling this story.
Gore = 3 There is a fair amount of gore both visual and perceived.
Sex/Nudity = 3 There is one scene of sex between the eldest daughter and a deputy without nudity except for the guy's plumbers butt. There are a few scenes of full frontal female victims nudity.
Cursing = 2 There is some and I think there was a couple of the F words, but overall not that much.
Violence =  3 There is about 4 or 5 scenes with knives, guns and shovels, but again not real graphic.
Entertainment Value =  4 If you have patience and like movies that tell their stories in detail over time I think you may enjoy this one as much as I did.",1390176000,3,2514,4.175619834710743
6036240,4,B00FXOO1VC,"We Are What We Are is fantastic, creepy, and completely unnerving. I loved this movie. Not for the faint of heart.",1390003200,,114,4.476190476190476
6036241,5,B00FXOO1VC,"TRADITIONS ARE USUALLY great  especially during holidays. But, what if descendants of the Donner Party lived in town? The Donners were American pioneers who set out for California only to become snowbound in the Sierra Nevada, resorting to cannibalism to survive. What kind of traditions might have they developed?

The cannibalism theme is not much of a spoiler; its easy to guess whats going on shortly after the movie begins. Whats good about We Are What We Are, based on a Mexican film, is the subtle and suspenseful way director Jim Mickle and writer Nick Damici present their story. You might remember Mickle and Damici from Stake Land, a classy independent about survival after a vampire apocalypse.

We Are What We Are doesn't fall into the spatter category  a feat that caused gore-loving horror fans to give negative reviews. Its a thriller, restrained and moody. Mickle is on record that he wanted to create a family drama with a horrific secret. Beautifully filmed in upstate New York, the setting could be Anywhere Mountain Rural, USA. It is always raining, maintaining a gothic, small town look  although that effect turned out to be a challenge. In An Acquired Taste: The Making of We Are What We Are, Mickle explains the sun shined throughout filming. The only time it rained was after theyd finished shooting a scene; other than that, the crew was in charge of creating cloudbursts.

Characters  played by Bill Sage, Julia Garner, Ambyr Childers, Jack Gore, Kelly McGillis (also of Stake Land), Michael Parks, and Wyatt Russell, son of Kurt and Goldie  are well drawn, believable and sympathetic. The Parkers are a religious and kindly family, who run the local trailer park. They keep to themselves, but after an accident in town that kills the mother, authorities begin to uncover clues as to why the family are such loners.

Commentary with Mickle and the cast is a jolly gab fest; theres a lot of goofing around, but good details throughout about how actor Jack Gore, who played the Parkers youngest child, made it through the scariest scenes. Theres lots to learn in Interviews with director Jim Mickle, Bill Sage and Julia Garner and An Acquired Taste: The Making of We Are What We Are, like how well the film played at Cannes.

Its not Silence of the Lambs, but it will keep you thinking.",1389830400,2,2312,4.830379746835443

6036243,5,B00FXOO1VC,"I have been waiting for this, ever since seeing Stake Land. I have very quickly become a big fan of Mickle and DaMici. I like the ""Art Film"" aspect of ""We Are What We Are"", which I had only seen prviously in films by from Kiyoshi Kurosawa. Alfred Hitchcock comes to mind as well. I was not prepared for the improved production value and overall quality of this film compared to their earlier releases, and it is clear that they are rapidly honing their craft. The writing and acting were excellent.",1389830400,,498,4.483516483516484
6036244,1,B00FXOO1VC,"Just a poorly structured, predictably irrational movie. Cultivates a mood of dread but it's purposeless. You know from the beginning what's going on and the conflict that finally picks up steam towards the end of the film needed to be there from the start.  If you like being frustrated by bad plotting, basic flaws in portraying simple (and not so simple) human psychology and behavior, then you may enjoy it. If not, you'll be totally annoyed that a film this dumb was shot so beautifully and wasted the talents of such good actors.",1389744000,,534,4.741935483870968

6036246,4,B00FXOO1VC,"I'm not going to give anything away by saying too much, But for a ""B"" movie, it was really interesting and well done. The acting was awesome and on the money. I like the fact that there was enough back story to understand this family and why they "" Are Who They Are"". lol. The ending was totally shocking and you won't see it coming! The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it was a little slow here and there. No problem for me though, it just sets you up a little longer for the ending.",1389571200,,497,3.98
6036247,4,B00FXOO1VC,"If you're looking for something other than a cheap thrill, this is it.

The film was well written and directed,  with many depths of meaning in each scene, much silently.  The story is well thought, and allows you to see the predicaments for yourself without turning to falsely obvious plot lines to lead you along.  The look is lush and beautifully colored.

All of the actors did a superb job.  Bill Sage, playing the father of the family, deserves great credit for his powerful interpretation of the role.  The two daughters played by Julia Garner and Ambyr Childers brought, I thought, an unusually nuanced performance level for their age, and younger of the two was especially talented.  You can clearly feel the weight of her emotions.

This is a horror film that won't disappoint.",1389398400,,787,4.813432835820896

6036249,2,B00FXOO1VC,This movie did a great job of being really creepy. My friend loves what I call barf movies. I forced myself to watch to the end but I was squirming and gaging all the way.

6036253,5,B00FXOO1VC,"This movie was worth it for the performance of the younger daughter alone-what an amazing actress. I hope to see her in more movies in the future. The movie had a spooky and disturbing air about it, I wasn't sure how to feel when it was over. It just has a weirdness about it that made you feel unsettled. Definitely something different and more of an art house flick. If you are into slasher films like Texas Chainsaw Massacre 3D this probably isn't for you. It's moody and moves at a slow pace while things unfold. Definitely something different. The man playing the father had a creepy serial killer vibe that worked for the part he played. He seems like just the type to abduct you from the side of the highway.",1388793600,6,715,4.424242424242424
