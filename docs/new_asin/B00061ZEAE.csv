8036863,5,B00061ZEAE,I love this one as I can't walk to see it in person. Marj,1526601600,,57,3.142857142857143
8036864,5,B00061ZEAE,this dvd showed some great tours of the cave-it was almost as good as touring in person-showed some great scenes of some large rooms----with great color photography,1521244800,,164,5.111111111111111
8036865,4,B00061ZEAE,"The DVD is a great summary of what one sees on a tour of the caverns.  Pretty much all of the major features are included.  I really appreciate it because as I get older, it would be difficult to return there.  The one down side is that this is a DVD rather than a Blu-ray.",1515542400,,273,3.9272727272727272
8036866,4,B00061ZEAE,"the family went to Carlsbad and bought a DVD while there. It was not given back when someone ""Borrowed"" it.",1395360000,,107,4.4
8036867,5,B00061ZEAE,"This is a virtual tour of some sights. They run on a PC. They take full 360 degree pictures from a location. Then you can maneuver your viewing direction with a mouse to see anything from any angle from the location the camera was located. You can look around, up at the roof, or down at the floor. You never see any part of the camera that took the picture or anyone standing by. Although you sometimes see people at a distance. The picture quality is quite good. These give you a good idea of what there is to see at the sites. We had been to Carlsbad and saw this at the book store. These are a better visual tour of a site then many as you can scan around and look at anything you like. You need good lighting to take pictures in Carlsbad. There are more from various national parks and we have several of them now.",1231200000,,819,4.125
8036868,5,B00061ZEAE,"My family and I recently visited Carlsbad Caverns. We entered through the natural entrance and toured the big room. I purchased this video at the gift shop on the way out. It shows the highlights of the cave in a way that I could not have filmed it myself. Also, the music tour, an extra on this dvd shows the bat flight from both inside the cave and outside the cave. Since no cameras or video recording devices are allowed at the bat flight program, this dvd is a true gem.",1224460800,2,475,4.230769230769231
8036869,5,B00061ZEAE,"The bonus footage of little-known Guadalupe Mountains National Park (which even has its own -- limestone, not granite -- El Capitan) adds to the value of this Carlsbad video.

At more than an hour in length, and exploring the aboveground desert of Carlsbad as well as the caverns, plus the 8,000-foot Guadalupes, this is a value buy.

Just about any Finley-Holiday video will be worth your money. High-quality shooting, good cinematography, informative voice-overs and very fitting musical scoring all add up to make a great series.

Plus, videos in the Finley-Holiday series normally have bonus features, such as sidebar attractions in the area. And, they film in all seasons of the year, something you and I can't do on a single trip.

In other words, if you haven't gone to a particular park yet, Finley-Holiday will be the final thing to get you going. If you have, it's a great souvenir without having to lug a camcorder around yourself.",1136160000,5,942,4.90566037735849
