4384931,3,B004I9SJFW,"Architect Peter Highman (Robert Downey Jr.) is trying to get home to his pregnant wife who is expecting soon when he comes into contact with Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis) an aspiring actor. After a series of unfortunate event's Peter and Zach get kicked off of their plane and end up carpooling to get home. These two characters confront several obstacles on their way home that seem impossible to recover from.

  ""Due Date"" is oddly low rated and I wonder if some critics saw the same movie I did. While I'm sure this movie isn't the next ""The Hangover"" it surely doesn't deserve such a low rating. The story isn't too great this is more of a new age of humor that was brought about due to movies like ""The Hangover"" and ""Superbad"" which sold like crazy to young audiences who find this more grotesque humor involving masturbation and bodily fluids wildly entertaining. Older audiences aren't going to enjoy it as much.

  This is basically the same scenario as ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles"" where you have two opposite characters who must work together to achieve the goal of getting home. This movie does not quite have the story and moments moments that really provoked strong emotion like in ""Planes, Trains, and Automobiles"" it does provide the laughter with some pretty bizarre scenarios. Robert Downey Jr. and Galifianakis is a weird combo but I believed that this movie really pulled it off.

While it isn't AMAZING it is still a decent movie to go see and provides some good laughs if you are in to that kind of humor.
I give this movie a 6 out of 10

4384932,4,B004I9SJFW,"Last year, Todd Phillips brought us The Hangover. Along with its massive success, it helped turn its three lead actors into even bigger stars. Included in that line up was Zach Galifianakis, stand-up comedian turned actor who now seems to be Phillips go to guy. So how could Galifianakis possibly top being in the highest grossing R-rated comedy of all time? He teams up with the man who became known for his portrayal of Tony Stark in Iron Man and Guy Ritchie's Sherlock Holmes, Robert Downey Jr, for the most outrageous comedy of 2010.

Seeing Robert Downey Jr in a film like this after his career exploded from doing Iron Man seems more outstanding than it really is. Or maybe it's just the mere thought of seeing the lead actor from some of the past few years biggest blockbusters in an R-rated comedy that features his character get high and be extremely ill tempered throughout its duration is entertaining in itself and strangely liberating. There isn't source material to follow that if strayed too far away from could cause fans to go into an uproar. Due Date is an original film and it just seems like doing comedy after two superhero films and a film based on the world's most infamous fictional detective would be creative freedom of sorts.

There was some concern that Zach Galifianakis' character in Due Date would be too similar to his character in The Hangover to really deliver a lot of laughs or be distinguishable in comparison. Truth be told, both characters are extremely similar but it works so well. Galifianakis is so funny, it hurts. Ethan Tremblay's ignorance is really what makes the film so incredibly ridiculous, over the top, and just downright hysterical. The blossoming friendship between Peter and Ethan is where the heart of the film truly lies though. The chemistry between both RDJ and Galifianakis is what makes so many scenes in the film so great. Watching Peter be in agony over having to deal with Ethan and his eccentric ways is pure comedy gold.

An interesting note about the film is that nearly every scene from the trailer is in the film. With all the alternate takes and deleted scenes that get shuffled around these days before a film gets released in theaters, that's saying a lot. It does make you wonder what sort of extras will be on the DVD and BD versions of the film though. One scene comes to mind that wasn't in the film, but that's it. Everything else that you've probably memorized (""You better check yourself before you wreck yourself."") is in there.

A few scenes to be on the lookout for, Peter has a certain way of dealing with the kids of a local drug dealer named Heidi (played by Juliette Lewis) that is sure to get an outstanding reaction from a packed theater. Also, the film puts an awkward yet priceless spin on the simple act of masturbating . There are so many gloriously preposterous things that transpire in the film that it should give you plenty of material to talk about with friends for days.

It's safe to consider Due Date as this year's The Hangover and that should definitely be taken as a compliment. It's the same director and one third of the main cast, but Due Date manages to set the bar for ludicrous acts achieved in film. Zach Galifianakis will provide most of the laughs, but it's the chemistry between both him and Robert Downey Jr that makes the comedy feel a bit more genuine than other comedies out there. With the end of 2010 just around the corner, Due Date may just be the funniest film of the year.",1289088000,4,3496,4.6231884057971016
4384933,3,B004I9SJFW,"A PLANES, TRAINS & AUTOMOBILES for a new generation (but far less successful), DUE DATE delivers many solid laughs, but is sloppy and unmoving.

Robert Downey Jr. is an uptight architect working away from home in Atlanta.  He's got a ticket to fly back home, because his wife (Michelle Monaghan) is scheduled to deliver their first child in just a few days.  Zack Galifianakis is the strange, troublesome guy who utterly messes up his plans...and the two are forced to embark on a road trip across the country together in a bid to reach California in time.  5 days should be plenty of time, but if you've ever seen a film like this...you know that there will be many frustrating delays along with way.

Galifianakis dreams of heading to Hollywood to come an actor, even though he has no experience.  He carries with him, in a coffee can, the ashes of his recently deceased father and also this French bulldog...an animal that gets laughs just by looking at him.  Galifianakis causes havoc everywhere he goes, with almost everything he touches, but his blissfully unaware.  He comes across as just a little simple minded.  Downey is very much the straight man; he's the victim of almost all the terrible consequences Galifianakis brings down on them.  He's uptight and humorless, a real misanthrope.

The biggest laughs, frankly, come from the interplay between this odd couple.  Their dialogue.  The two characters operate on such different levels that they seldom seem to be on the same page.  There are other, more slap-sticky laughs, with car crashes and perhaps the least likely ""escape from the cops and lead them on a chase"" scene you're ever going to see.  But these two pros really banter together nicely.

But the movie tries to intersperse ""touching"" moments (mostly revolving around memories of fathers) into the often highly crude proceedings.  These scenes, frankly, feel forced and clumsy.  We can sort of believe Galifianakis' odd remembrances of his deceased dad, but when Downey abruptly spills his heart...it feels almost like that scene in GREMLINS when Phoebe Cates suddenly talks about the death of her dad.  It's abrupt, clumsily written and because it generates no real emotion, becomes almost laughable.  (In fact, Galifianakis has a wonderful reaction to the moment and thankfully sets the tone right again.)

There is a supporting cast, but mostly they do far from their best work.  Jamie Foxx appears briefly and looks to be in a hurry to get out of the film.  Danny McBride delivers his usual shtick (but he does have a good line about making a reservation for Chili's).  Juliette Lewis appears as a drug dealer and is given nothing to do.  And Michelle Monaghan, who was SO good with Downey in KISS, KISS, BANG, BANG mostly spends time on the phone pleading with hubby to come back...ANYONE could have played her part.

Because the film generates no emotional resonance (it simply tries too hard), it leaves room to notice bothersome things.  The film seems to imply that El Paso/Juarez are fairly near to I-40, when in fact they are 4 hours apart.  Vehicles are abandoned (what DOES happen to the Range Rover?) and we have the time to wonder about them.

Director and co-writer Todd Phillips did such a great job with THE HANGOVER.  He gave us annoying characters that we grew to like.  The movie tied up all loose ends (heck, the entire thing was pretty much about tying up loose ends).  While it was obscene at times, it was always funny.  DUE DATE is frequently obscene and cringe-inducing.  It spends too much time showing characters on drugs (don't moviemakers get that extended sequences showing a character that doesn't do drugs getting stoned aren't really all that funny?).  It leaves loose ends everywhere it goes.  THE HANGOVER didn't try for ""touching moments""...it just tried to be the funniest movie it could be.  DUE DATE tries too hard, and the comedy suffers.

In the end, I feel the biggest fault of the film is that although we like, as moviegoers, Downey and Galifianakis, we DON'T like their characters.  Downey is kind of a mean and obnoxious guy.  Galifianakis is kind of clueless, annoying and dangerous.  We just don't really care all that much what happens to them.  I laughed a fair amount at the film, and had a good enough time...but I had hoped for much more, so my overriding feeling was disappointment.",1289088000,3,4364,4.834008097165992
4384934,5,B004I9SJFW,"""Due Date"" is great! This is how the story goes: Peter Highman is an expectant first-time father whose wife's due date is a mere five days away. As Peter hurries to catch a flight home from Atlanta to be at her side for the birth, his best intentions go completely awry when a chance encounter with aspiring actor Ethan Tremblay forces Peter to hitch a ride with Ethan--on what turns out to be a cross-country road trip that will ultimately destroy several cars, numerous friendships and Peter's last nerve.

The cast led by Robert Downey Jr. (as Peter Highman) & Zach Galifianakis (as Ethan Tremblay) is great! The directing by Todd Phillips (also co-wrote the screenplay & produced) (he also directed ""Road Trip"" (2000), ""Old School"" (2003, also produced and wrote the screenplay & story), ""Starsky & Hutch"" (2004, also wrote the screenplay), ""School For Scoundrels"" (2006, also produced & wrote the screenplay), ""The Hangover"" (2009, also produced) & its upcoming sequel (2011, also producing and writing the screenplay) is great! The story by Alan R. Cohen & Alan Freedland, the screenplay by Cohen, Freedland, Phillips & Adam Sztykiel (who also wrote the story & screenplay to ""Made Of Honor"" (2008) is great!

The music by Christophe Beck (who also did the music to ""School For Scoundrels"", ""The Hangover"", ""Waiting For 'Superman'"" (2010), ""Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief"" (2010), ""Hot Tub Time Machine"" (2010), ""Date Night"" (2010), ""Death At A Funeral"" (2010), ""Red"" (2010) & the upcoming ""Burlesque"" (2010) is great!

The film editing by Debra Neil-Fisher (who also did the film editing to ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" (1991), ""Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery"" (1997) & its sequel, ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" (1999), ""How To Lose A Guy In 10 Days"" (2003), ""Baby Mama"" (2008) & ""The Hangover"") is great! The casting by Juel Bestrop (he also did the casting to ""Starsky & Hutch"", ""Dodgeball: A True Underdog Story"" (2004), ""Anchorman: The Legend Of Ron Burgundy"" (2004), ""I, Robot"" (2004), ""Kicking & Screaming"" (2005) & ""The Break-Up"" (2006) & Seth Yanklewitz (both of them also did the casting to ""Norbit"" (2007), ""Blades Of Glory"" (2007), ""Fool's Gold"" (2008), ""The Unborn"" (2009), ""The Hangover"" & ""Alvin And The Chipmunks: The Squeakquel"" (2009) is great! The production design by Bill Brzeski (who also did the production design to ""Matilda"" (1996), ""As Good As It Gets"" (1997), ""Blue Streak"" (1999), ""Stuart Little"" (1999) & its sequel (2002), ""The Bucket List"" (2007), ""The Forbidden Kingdom"" (2008), ""The Hangover"" & its upcoming sequel) is great! The art direction by Shepherd Frankel (who also did the art direction to ""Stuart Little 2"", ""Terminator 3: Rise Of The Machines"" (2003), ""Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed"" (2004) & ""Fantastic Four"" (2005), he also did the production design to ""Step Up"" (2006), ""P.S. I Love You"" (2007), ""27 Dresses"" (2008), ""Four Christmases"" (2008) & ""Couples Retreat"" (2009) (supervising art director), Desma Murphy (who was an assistant director on ""The Hangover"" & is doing the art direction to its upcoming sequel) & Clint Wallace (who also did the art direction to ""Couples Retreat"" & the upcoming ""Captain America: The First Avenger"" (2011) is great! The set decoration by Danielle Berman (who also did the set decoration to ""Memento"" (2000), ""Into The Wild"" (2007) & ""The Hangover"") is great! The costume design by Louise Mingenbach (who also did the costume design to ""The Usual Suspects"" (1995), ""Apt Pupil"" (1998), ""X-Men"" (2000), its sequel ""X2"" (2003) & one of its prequels ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" (2009), ""K-PAX"" (2001), ""The Rundown"" (2003), ""Starsky & Hutch"", ""Spanglish"" (2004), ""Superman Returns"" (2006), ""School For Scoundrels"", ""Hancock"" (2008), ""The Hangover"" & the upcoming ""Battleship"" (2012) is great!

This is a great comedy that keeps you laughing and thinking at the same time. This is a funny and entertaining movie. This is a great follow-up for Todd Phillips & Zach Galifianakis after ""The Hangover"".",1289001600,,4252,5.159420289855072
4384935,5,B004I9SJFW,"I just saw the advance screening of this movie, I won't give away anything if I can help it, because some things in this movie are funny because you don't know they are going to happen.

The genre is comedy, but I think it was a little closer to comedy/action movie which really made it work well.

Some of the really funny bits in this movie might be time worn cliches, but Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis pull them off masterfully!

I was part of a crowd of approx 420 people and I think everyone in there was laughing.

It does have some usage of the ""F"" word, but in context, so I was not offended, even though I normally do not use cuss words.

My personal reactions to this movie? Laugh, face palm, laugh, laugh, kick the seat in front of me (oops) Laugh really hard, etc",1288569600,4,785,4.241610738255034

4384948,5,B004I9SJFW,"Robert Downey, Jr. plays straight-man Peter Highman to the quirky & thoroughly amusing character played by Zach Galifianakis.  Downey's Peter Highman is a thoroughly reponsible businessman whose wife is 'due' to have their baby within just a few days.  Zach Galifianakis plays Ethan Tremblay, an insecure, aspiring actor who has his French Bulldog along for this zany ride.  To the somewhat straightlaced Peter, Ethan seems to fall somewhere between a brain-addled nut and a harmless (anything but!) innocent man-child, who Peter vacillates between feeling sorry for & somehow also reponsible for and furious with!  These two diametrically opposed strangers meet on a plane where a mishap occurs, which results in the two being removed from the plane & embarking on a cross-country trek where, at every turn, bedlam ensues!!  Michele Monaghan & Jamie Foxx co-star.

This is the movie to reach for when you need a good laugh that's an almost ""out-of-body"" experience...it IS THAT FUNNY!!!  And, also, happily poignant & touching...which was totally unexpected from such an uproariously madcap screwball comedy!!",1517616000,,1110,5.4186046511627906

4385039,1,B004I9SJFW,"I wish there was a way to give this film less than one star!  The movie's only redeeming qualities were that Robert Downey, Jr. was in it and the brief clip from Two and a Half Men.  As usual, Zach Galinakis was obnoxious and not at all funny.  If I had been Downey, Jr.'s character, I would have killed him.  I won't compare this film to The Hangover because Zach was obnoxious in that one as well.  His attempts at physical and derivative comedy just don't do it.  Sorry, just my opinion!",1470873600,,490,4.271739130434782

4385106,1,B004I9SJFW,"This movie stars two of my favorite actors, so  just assumed it would be great. Not so! Not the fault of the actors, but the bi-polar screenplay. It changed from best-buddy to worst enemy so many times we couldn't keep up. We did not care about any of the characters or what happens to them, well maybe the dog, but only a little. Another reviewer compares Due Date to Planes, Trains, and Automobiles. This movie isn't anywhere good enough to compare to that Steve Martin classic. There is just no clear concept of what the writers wanted, so no way that the actors, no matter how good at their craft, could possibly deliver. This was not even good for a couple hours of escapism. It is so bad that you spend time watching it, thinking it will surely get better, and when it doesn't, you feel cheated out of the time spent waiting for what never happens.",1443312000,,854,4.439490445859873

I loved RDJ as Sherlock Holmes.  I bought this movie specifically because he was part of the Due Date cast.  I won't make that mistake again.  After watching all I could stomach of Due Date, I no longer have the same admiration for RDJ.

Pass on this movie. It isn't funny and the script is lame.",1421193600,,645,4.120967741935484

It ranges from sad and feeling sorry for someone...to wanting to bang that person's head against a locker. Downey is ostensibly the star, or has more recognition and star power, but Galifianakis almost soaks up and steals every scene. It is very funny, and I do not laugh easily.

What is even more bizarre is the fact that the main characters were driving a stolen Federales vehicle and the CHP didn't even notice?  Give me a break.

This is not a movie I would buy, but I don't regret watching it twice. I'm a huge Robert Downey, Jr fan, and he's awesome in this movie. He's a more serious character in this one than his other popular movies--a perfect performance! Zach Galifianakis, I either love or hate him in movies. This one, I love him because I hate him!

4385246,4,B004I9SJFW,"Given who the stars for this movie were, I, and many others, expected more comedy from the pairing of Robert Downey, Jr., and Zach Galifianakis.  Unfortunetly, while the film was still enjoyable, it wasn't what it could have been.  For one thing, it ought to have somehow had more of Michelle Monaghan, who, in my opinion, is someone whose talent as an actress is rarely put to use to its full potencial.  We could have also used more of Jamie Foxx, though he's seen much more screen time in his career.  The plot was a decent idea, though it had been used already in films such as Planes, Trains, and Automobiles.  Ultimately, I am not sure what exactly caused this film to fall so far below its expectations.  Maybe it was bad writing, bad direction, bad something else, or a combination.  Maybe it's simply because, while the idea of the straight-man Robert Downey, Jr., and goofy Zach Galifianakis might look good on paper, it simply didn't work in real life...that just sometimes happens.  But, being a fan of both actors, I didn't find this film the worst in the world.  Everybody definetly tried to make it work and that should be applauded.  Enjoy.",1401408000,,1156,4.650246305418719

Well, no actually. The film includes scatterbrained plot twists and set-ups that go nowhere, or almost nowhere. The two main characters' poisonous relationship (the only potential laugh-getter in this film) is suddenly and inexplicably transformed into a moping kind of bromance.

Then we have the odd ball, sensitive character (Zach) who bumps heads with (Downey) at every turn through out the movie. It was an OK movie and I may watch it again for free.  Ultimately in the end,  Downey's character seemed to embrace the other character (Zach).  I just kept feeling so sorry for him (Zach) through out.  It was hard to follow (Downey's) character other than him being a very uptight guy who was void of any fun.  (Zach) was a lonely guy in need of quality friendship.  In the end he finds it..  It was filled with laughs as well.",1391299200,,716,4.363636363636363

Robert Downey Jr. actually takes a step in the right direction.  Sharing the spotlight with a comedian even more manic and juvenile than himself forces him to underplay it for once.

Remember that really funny movie where the straight-laced business man is trying to get home and winds up accidentally stuck with, but half relying on a lout that may not be that bright, but has a good heart, and by the end they're caring friends to each other?

Yeah, it was called Plains, Trains and Automobiles. You should rewatch that if you ever even think of putting this other piece of dreck on your screen. Due Date attempts to rip off, er, ""pay homage"" to that formula and fails miserably at it. Neither of the main characters have the likable qualities of the characters from the better movie and it's hard to feel sympathetic towards either part of the duo. Clever funny gags and innuendos have been replaced by crude attempts at humor, a poor script, and generally annoying dialogue.

And while in Plains, by the end of the movie, for all his mistakes and foibles, you still want to give Del Griffith a hug and invite him to Thanksgiving dinner, by the end of Due Date you want to take Ethan and apply percussive maintenance until he stops twitching. Any attempts to make him sympathetic are bulldozed over by the obnoxiousness of his overall characterization. The same can be said of Downey's character, who constantly reminds us that even if he may be justified in being annoyed, he goes beyond all bounds of decency to sheer a-hole half the time. And not even the kind of a-hole we can laugh at that much.

So avoid this mish-mash of a movie and just watch the classic, actually-funny comedy from which it ripped off half its plot points.",1370390400,5,1600,4.607017543859649

I think Peter was supposed to come away from this ""enlightened"" but he's not the one who needed changing. It pretty much ends where it started. The diversion to his friend's house in Dallas isn't really resolved. There is a LOT of violence and blood for a comedy. It's just odd and not funny.

Unfortunately, if you've seen the preview, you've seen all the funny parts. Robert Downy is great as the moody, uptight, Peter. Zach Galifianakis however, was pretty bland. Metro-sexual Ethan didn't have the same shock value and loveable loser quality as Alan did, I didn't find him funny, I just felt sorry for him. The plot didn't help the film much either.

(The dog should be given credit for the cute factor. Cream colored Frenchie named Sonny)

We thought they tried to make this like the movie : TRAINS -PLANES AND AUTOMOBILES- which was a GOOD movie, but this road trip felt like it  never really went anywhere.

Simple storyline:Downey has to get back home to his  very , due any moment, pregnant wife and time is running out.

That is it.

 The rest is a mad rush with the two characters using any means of transport to get Downey back to the hospital in time.

When I went over the scenes in my head after it was over, I couldn't figure out what happened.  Each scene had the potential to be funny, but it just wasn't.

My guess is that the original script was funny, but something happened in the directing, acting, and final edits that just went sour.

It could be another case of delusions of grandeur where the makers of this film were so sure it was funny that they went into it over confident and forgot to get feedback on each scene after it was shot, to go back and edit it.  As I said, each scene should have been funny, but the delivery made it awkward, uncomfortable, and something you groan at, not laugh at.  It was a huge disappointment.  Towards the end of the film, they just take it way too far.  I don't want to give away spoilers but there's no way the main character would respond to the other main character the way he does, warm and tolerant at the end.  The crazy guy tries really hard to ruin his life, and it ends with them good friends because of all they went through.  That made NO sense at all.  It seemed obvious to me that this was a result of a bad editing job.  It's like they ended up with too long of a film, so chopped out scenes where they redeem the crazy guy's character, but it still ended as if they've showed us some reason why the main character wouldn't just have him arrested or worse, killed him or something.",1360886400,2,1457,4.2202166064981945

I'm sorry but I didn't laugh once (ONCE I TELL YOU) during the entire run time. It just didn't make any sense even in the most stoner, moronic or desperate of ways. There are several times in this film where you say ""I would have parted ways with this guy."" but for some unexplained reason they keep staying together. The whole ""I have to get home one way or another before the my wife's due date"" just didn't gel with me as a sufficient reason to risk life or limb. It's an important event but is it worth all the crap RDJ went through in this film? I understand desperation but the scenarios were unfunny and idiotic. Anytime somebody nearly kills you or seriously maims you is a surefire reason to part ways with them. I know they want Zach Galifianakis to be the lovable, clueless moron but he never seemed like a nuisance you didn't mind having. Zach was the same exact guy you saw in that ""other"" film and I mean the exact same character. Robert Downey Jr usually kills with his charm but in this he was equally at fault as Galifianakis as to why this wasn't funny. Neither was relatable or you cared about and neither were Jamie Foxx  or Michelle Monaghan who equally gave some wooden performances. Planes, Trains & Automobiles had heart and plenty of laughs but this was the 1st time in a while I didn't like any character in this film.

4385410,3,B004I9SJFW,"And that film was ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"", the John Candy/Steve Martin vehicle.  However, that film was funny (hilarious in spots) and very enjoyable to watch.

'Due Date' stars Robert Downey, Jr. as Peter Highland, a man whose wife is about to give birth.  He's across the country in Atlanta, and the movie details all the trouble he runs into just trying to fly back to the left coast (LA).  He runs into
Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis) who is one bad luck charm just waiting to ruin your day (and your trip).

The resemblance to 'Planes...' is enough to periodically compare the two at different points of the film.  Due Date suffers in comparison, unless you are looking for a dark comedy to watch for an hour-and-a half.

This movie will be great to people who can ignore how much of it has already been done in other road trip comedies. I even saw things ripped directly out of Todd Phillip's last movie. I love the cast, and honestly, they're the main reason that I can re-visit this film for repeat viewings. Zach Galafianakis is always a pleasure, to me at least, and I really enjoy Robert Downey Jr. in just about everything he does. Problem is that Due Date seemed to not have much effort put into it, but luckily the cast cared enough to make up for it. Otherwise, it's sure to get a handful of laughs, especially if you didn't see the trailers a hundred times.

The movie is laugh out loud funny. I didn't think that it measured up to the original PT&A, simply because Downey's character was far less colorful than Steve Martin.

Zach Galifianakis absolutely flounders here.  Don't get me wrong.  I think Galafianakis is a real comic find with his work in the ""Hangover"" movies and ""Dinner for Schmucks"".  He could be the next John Candy but here he seems to be channeling Chris Elliott or, even worse, Tom Green.  Robert Downey Jr. is left with egg on his face playing straightman to Galifianakis' pathetic antics.  What keeps me from giving this one star is the occasional laugh notably a scene at the Western Union station.  Regardless, a waste of time.

4385424,1,B004I9SJFW,"If you've seen Planes, Trains & Automobiles, it's basically the same thing but without any of the warmth, depth or charm. Irredeemable narcissist Peter Highman (Robert Downey Jnr) is trying to get home in time for his wife's due date, while freakishly-weird-yet-naive Ethan Chase (Zach G) gets physically abused by him. That's it.

In an update to the problem of getting on a plane from the first film, Due Date sullies the good name of our passenger-gropers at the TSA by placing our intrepid heroes on the no-fly list. There are some bag mix-ups and other really, really weak coincidences to force this situation but needless to say they both end up in a rental car pegging it across the country while they get to learn about each other.

Before we get any further, I should point out that this is another ""all the funny parts are in the trailer"" movie though anything that looks mildly amusing in the promo is more unpleasant when you watch the whole thing. For example, RDJ at one point spits in the dog's face - HE SPITS IN THE DOG'S FACE - and then threatens to rip it apart limb from limb. Violence to humans can be funny - it's the basis of the banana skin joke and most cartoons - but violence to animals always falls flat. He then goes on to punch an 8-year old - no kidding.

The character arc that's jammed into Act 3 is one of the most unconvincing in modern cinema. When RDJ decides to be best pals with Zach, I felt like I'd  accidentally cued forward 10 minutes and missed a bunch of important scenes. 5 minutes earlier he'd rammed Zach's head into the side of a car panel and now suddenly they're soul mates.

Due Date is possibly the most unpleasant film experience of the year (barring any sequel to Touristas I don't know about), consistently confusing comedy with cruelty and it may continue to rank as one of the cruelest films of the decade (at least until the Farrelly Brothers write another script). In case there's any confusion, I hated this film. I didn't laugh once - and I laugh at almost anything.",1327536000,5,2028,4.5

Zach plays Ethan, a wanabee actor headed from Atlanta to Hollywood.  Downey is an architect headed the same way trying to get to the birth of his first child.  Naturally mayhem ensues as both are kicked off the plane and put on the no fly list - the first of many improbables in the movie.

Essentially it all boils down to the relationship between the smug Peter (RD, Jr.) and the wacko Ethan.  Think ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"" only meaner.  Neither character is likeable, but I guess that's the point.  Downey is Zach's straight man for the most part.  For me, the best scenes are when they end up in Mexico.  Too many unlikely or impossible events, but still slapstick funny.",1325721600,,817,4.7785714285714285
4385427,1,B004I9SJFW,"Let me begin by saying that I have immense respect for the talent of Robert Downey Jr. and normally his presence can rescue any film. That being said, it is unfortunate that Due Date weighs him down to the point that ""rescue"" is not possible. This film is a recycled Trains, Planes and Automobiles which sadly lacks the charm so associated with the famed John Candy, Steve Martin classic. Due Date has a disease - poor writing combined with absence of heart. Its not all that funny and the lead characters in general are so unappealing that I found it hard to root for either of them.

There are other unfavorable reviews here reflecting that the reviewers do not subscribe to this type of comedy (The Hangover, Harold and Kumar, Bridesmaids) but I am not one of those. I usually enjoy a good ""gonzo"" picture as long as the laughs/writing is there to back up the crude antics of the players. Due Date just didn't succeed in this arena or in any other.

4385435,3,B004I9SJFW,"This film is a pale shade of the much, much superior and even more hilarious Thanksgiving classic: Planes, Trains and Automobiles. Steve Martin and John Candy may have physical differences, but their comic styles compliment each other well. Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis as a mismatched couple, would likely end up in a bitter divorce. Of all mismatched buddy movies, this match is made in hell. Director Todd Philips should take a leaf from early buddy movies such as 48 hours, Lethal Weapon and the aforementioned John Hughes holiday classic for a template.

Other than the badly miscast Downey Jr., who should be in Zach's role in my opinion, is a typical Type A tightass yuppie. Zach is a social misfit and with all his eccentricities considered, it's a wonder he's not being committed in an asylum. Carrying pot wherever you go, jerking off in front of a stranger? Come on, all these are ingredients for getting your hind thrown into the joint. He's a walking and talking police bait.

All in all, other than a few laugh out loud moments; such as the episode involving the ash urn and Jamie Foxx, the rest of the movie seemed cobbled together and joined up in a slipshod manner.

4385439,5,B004I9SJFW,"When catching the commercials for this movie there were certainly hints at how funny this movie could be, but in watching it you really get a much fuller experience.

There are moments of subtle humor where you have to listen to the under the breath commentary while the louder moments are happening to catch all of the gems of hilarity, and while this does have a bit of a tried and true formula to it, the main characters are far funnier than expected.

Sure, when Peter and Ethan meet at the airport you just know things are going to go from bad to worse, and when that ball starts rolling you almost grind your teeth in frustration at how bad things are getting for poor Peter (played by Robert Downey, Jr.) but it's the smaller moments, not the over the top guffaw moments, that make this such a funny movie.

Yes, some of it is adolescent humor, but that's a foregone conclusion when you have two guys and a funky little dog on a road trip.

It also has some very sweet and heartfelt moments mixed in between the onslaught events that keep pushing them toward getting home for the birth of Peter's baby.

For those who want to compare this movie to others are welcome to do so, but in all truth, I watch each movie with one thing in mind:  I want to be entertained.

Was this movie entertaining?  Absolutely.

Was this movie funny?  In places I laughed so hard I could barely catch my breath.

4385440,3,B004I9SJFW,"First, I really like Downey as an actor - he can be as serious or as corny as they come (like in Tropic Thunder) and be good either way. He basically mailed this role in - there's nothing here that stretched him as an actor in any way but he's still better mailing it in than most actors trying their best.  There's some really funny moments in the film and his ""buddy"" interaction works for the most part.  However, to enjoy this movie, you have to totally dismiss any connection to reality and forgot how lame the story really is.  I will mention ONE scene that totally blows it - Downey calls his friend (Fox) to help him out and is given money and car to DRIVE rest of the way.  Now, given his circumstances and urgent need to get to his wife AND his hate for the forced roadmate, WHY THE HECK DIDN""T HE JUST FLY REST OF THE WAY?",1318204800,,833,4.15527950310559

4385448,4,B004I9SJFW,"Due Date is about two men who are polar opposites meeting up unintentionally at an airport and gradually becoming friends.  The one man is ultra uptight and serious while the other guy has a couple loose screws and is just a plain goofball who appears to be uncertain about what exactly he wants in life.

Together, they go on a cross country road trip.  The purpose of this trip?  Well there appears to be two reasons.  One, the goofy guy wants to find an appropriate place to dump his fathers ashes, and the serious guy wants to get home to his pregnant wife in time for the birth of their baby.

For the most part, the strength of Due Date lies almost entirely in the way the two men try to communicate with each other and accept each others *drastically* different perspective of the world.  It's a challenge for sure!  While travelling across the country, the two men find themselves in several different interesting situations.  My favorite is when the two men arrive to a house where a woman likes listening to the rock band Cream and doing drugs, while her kids have fun picking on the serious guy in the living room.  It's funny because the serious guy shouldn't even BE there in the first place!

Pretty soon however, viewers will begin to realize there's not much of a plot taking place.  It's just one silly segment leading directly into another one, and that's about the gist of what you can expect with Due Date.  Overall, funny at times, though sometimes the silliness reaches a level of absurdity that's just plain pointless and makes you wonder if you really want to see this movie to its conclusion.

I would counter that the real problem is the overuse of character types and traits by the same actors or actresses across multiple movies.  This movie, Due Date, exemplifies my point.  The movie is about two men who go on a cross-country road trip which leads to them bonding as friends.  Robert Downey Jr. plays one character, a self-made, successful man who lost his father while young, and has a successful black man as his best friend.  This sounds oddly reminiscent of his character in the Iron Man movies.  The other main character of Due Date is played by Zach Galifianakis.  His character is an idiot, disturbed, gross, yet desperately seeking friendship to the point of doing cruel, underhanded things to the other people.  This sounds too close to his character in The Hangover films to be mere coincidence.  And seeing that this movie came out so close to the latest Iron Man and Hangover movies takes away from its innovative and original plot line, and some of its humor also.  I guess if one were to see this film before watching either Iron Man or Hangover movies, it would come across better, and probably deserve more than the 2 stars I am giving it here.",1311379200,,1316,4.682608695652174

They run into each other at the airport and Galifianakis continues to be a bother for Downey Jr. After being forced to exit their plane, they have to go on a cross-country drive to California in a small call with a dog.

The only scene that I was actually laughing was the ""take care of my kids for awhile"" scene with RDJr but after 10 more minutes... that was it.

Zach Galifiankis has his moments in his role, but grated on me at times. Overall the humor is uneven, and it started off slow. Although it has some funny moments, it also has many that fall flat, and some of the attempts to make the movie more soulful didn't quite work (to be fair, some did.)

Through a very unbelievable set of events these two characters are thrown together on a road-trip across country, to try and make it to the birth of the Downey character's first child. They are opposites - Downey's character is clean, orderly, and uptight, Galifiankis's is dirty, sloppy, and annoying. They both have emotional baggage having to do with their fathers, and at times their emotions related to this baggage create touching moments, but at other times it just falls flat. The same goes for much of the humor - it either works or completely flops.

If you like either of these actors, it's worth your time, or if you are looking for a few laughs but are OK with some flops in between. Otherwise, try something else.",1305936000,,1154,4.4904761904761905

Due Date, for me, is by far the lesser of the two. I suppose one could watch them back to back and ponder the societal changes that have gone down in the intervening quarter century as reflected in what's acceptable fare on the screen.  Instead, I personally spent most of the last half hour of the movie wondering if our border crossings with Mexico had become so lax that an obviously stolen vehicle, driven by two people without ID, can get so easily into the United States.  That puzzle  replaced the earlier bemusement at how two people could survive an obviously fatal crash with only minor injuries.  Due Date has some laughs, no doubt about that, but too many of them are tinged with sadism and antic though the plot is, it is ultimately not all that engaging.",1305936000,,971,4.654970760233918
4385471,4,B004I9SJFW,"Note: There are spoilers.  You have been warned.

I'm not going to lie.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film.  There is nothing better than fate (mostly Ethan) colliding two complete opposites as they must rely on one another with the task of traveling across the country.  It's the kind of film that you watch when you just need to laugh.  While I thoroughly enjoy many different films, comedy is the one of the few genres that can easily mask and interweave itself in other genres.  However, this film is made for the single purpose of laugher.  I am totally fine with that.

What I loved most about the film was the dialogue.  There was some mild wit but truly hilarious moments.  Of course, Zach Galifianakis was the perfect choice as the unbelievably clueless Ethan Tremlay.  It doesn't show Galifianakis' range of acting, but he perfects what he does best: being annoyingly awkward and idly enjoying the aftermath.

Robert Downey Jr. as Peter Highman was an interesting yet exceptional choice.  The differences in both Ethan and Peter are present physically but throughout the film (of course) you see their similarities (which are few) but magnified by their experiences together.  A feeling of comraderie slowly engages Peter leaving the audience wondering if he is in it to reach his wife before birth or if he truly feels a friendship forming between him and Ethan.  Or was it the pot?

Throughout the film, there are great moments of clarity.  Ethan will say something extremely intuitive, and Peter will respect him, feeling that he probably judged Ethan wrong.  Immediately after this revelation, Ethan does something else to break it.  It's repetitive but effective.

One thing I didn't like was the entrance of Darryl's character.  It was never resolved, and I absolutely hate it when conflicts like that are never resolved.  Also, I felt that his character was filler.  It added nothing to the movie, and I immediately forgot about his character after the movie was finished.  Of course, it did add a little bit of conflict between Peter and his wife, Ethan egging him on to interrogate until he received the answer that he wants.

Is this movie worth watching?  Absolutely.  If you're in the mood to laugh, if you love Zach Galifianakis' humor, and if you just love silly comedy films, it's definitely worth it.  I loved this film.  It was like a movie.",1305676800,2,2365,4.84

4385475,3,B004I9SJFW,"When Peter (Downey Jr) is on his way home from Atlanta to LA for the birth of his first child, he meets Ethan (Galifianakis) and his life gets turned upside down.

Over the course of the film they will get thrown off the plane, start an ill fated road trip where mishaps and injuries occur and Peter's patience is tested to it limit. Ethan is a well meaning, but clumsy, irritating buffoon and his entry into Peter's life starts a chain of events that will leave them irrevocably bonded, but it won't be an easy ride by any stretch of the imagination.

This film had a few funny moments that raised a chuckle, but generally I found it to be a rather dry affair. The chemistry between Downey Jr and Galifianakis seemed lacking and whilst the extras gag reel showed them having a good time during filming, this didn't translate onto the screen. Juliette Lewis' brief appearance was one of the highlights of the film and her performance was as good as we have come to expect from her. The direction was average at best with nothing especially note-worthy and the best part of this film was probably the soundtrack which features Neil Young, Band of Horses and Pink Floyd.

All in all this is an ok comedy film, but the laughs are few and far between and whilst it isn't the worst film I've ever seen, it is nowhere near the best either. This is the kind of film you'll watch once, be reasonably entertained and then forget by the time a couple of days have passed. Give it a go, but don't expect anything outstanding.

This will more than satisfy that, but the movie itself moves into a different direction that it partially--but not fully--deliver on.

Robert Downey Jr. is masterful as the dickish, temper-prone, soon-to-be father architect on his way cross county after an incident on an air plane puts him on the no-fly list. He is accompanied by a wanna-be actor, Zach Galifanakis.

Of course, hilarity ensures. But with it comes a lot a heart as both recount memories of their respective fathers and how it has shaped their lives. The film, though, had much more room to grow with this though, failing, though, and contimues in the outlandish comedic actions.

There is a lot of heart and as you continue to watch it, your feeling for the charactors grows. You only make it to the top of the hill, though, instead of over to the other side. But it is full of laughs front to back.

4385502,4,B004I9SJFW,"Road trips always seem to make funny movies. The discomfort of those forced to endure another irritating person or having to make do with a bad situation are situations we've all been faced with. So why not get a laugh out of the same thing at someone else's expense? It made the hilarious PLANES TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES one of the funniest movies even after 23 years. Yes it has been that long. Who better to take the reins from Steve Martin and John Candy than Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis?

DUE DATE begins with architect Peter Highman (Downey) trying to make it home from Atlanta in time for the birth of his son. He begins by nearly being killed as he exits his limo by some yokel dropping off Ethan Trembly (Galifianakis). This leads to a misunderstanding (and some hilarity as Ethan attempts to put his luggage in the overheard) leaving Peter on the no-fly list, suspected of terrorism. Who else is there to blame but the goofy Ethan?

With his wallet packed and on the plane, Peter searches for a way home. Fortunately, or perhaps unfortunately, one presents itself when Ethan shows up with a rental car insisting that Peter join him for the road trip to LA. And so begins one of the most famous road trips that has some of the funniest moments in a comedy of late.

As the pair travel we get to see Peter as a stick in the mud, serious person with little room for anything in his life other than his own needs. On the other hand Ethan moves about willy nilly without a care in the world, looking at the trip as fun and taking care of his pet dog Sonny. In point of fact, this trip will change both men. Peter will learn in the oddest way possible what it means to be a father and take care of someone. Ethan will face the reality of his father's death.

That's another part of the story. Along for the ride carried in a coffee can are the ashes of Ethan's recently deceased father. As Peter maps out their route to get them there in time, Ethan mentions that the Grand Canyon would be a great place for his father's ashes to which Peter informs him that it's miles out of their way. The topic comes up again later with a different location, each time revealing something more about Ethan.

The duo make their way cross country, stopping to pick up some weed (it's medicinal for Ethan's ""glaucoma""), crashing their car, finding they have no money, a run in with a vet at Western Union and more. Each scene seems to offer more laughs than the last and no, I won't spoil them by giving you details here. Suffice to say that there were moments that I had to either pause the movie or back it up once I stopped laughing.

But there is a sweetness to this movie as well. And that's another thing that reminded me of the earlier PLANES. We have two characters, both stuffy and all businesslike that end up next to someone with a lot of well hidden pain in their life. The question becomes less about the physical trip and more about the emotional one that they both make.

Downey shines here as the jerk that has the best intentions in his decisions, a man who is fearful that he won't make the birth of his child. Short tempered most of the time and very caring at others, he makes the journey to fatherhood over the miles. Galifianakis turns in his usual solid performance as the waif who needs something more in his life. His trip to Hollywood in hopes of being an actor, even though his character shows little ability, shows the dreams that so many have. My biggest fear with him is that he will find himself pigeonholed into these same roles. This one seems very much like the one he played in THE HANGOVER. It's a curse that many comedic actors fall into but few rise out of. Take a look at Pauley Shore for a bad example.

The movie offers some terribly crude moments that are sure to offend some and make others laugh till their sides split. For the sake of my family I'll plead the fifth (although one scene involving both Ethan and Sonny made me laugh harder when I saw the shocked look on my wife's face while we watched the movie). And when the final sequence shows, amazingly enough during the whole Charlie Sheen brouhaha of late, you'll find yourself touched by these two men and the trip they took.

4385506,4,B004I9SJFW,This is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a while. I am not about to compare it with any other as it does just right on it's own. It's the tale of two characters and a dog making a trip that would not have happened if one party had a choice and how the experience pulls them into a friendship of sorts as well as drives them apart at times. Robert Downey's character was a bit of a snob but five minutes into the film I was on his side with a travel partner like that.,1301184000,,476,3.8181818181818183
4385507,3,B004I9SJFW,"Due Date has been receiving quite a bit of mixed reviews since its release; it seems viewers either love it or hate it. Obviously Due Date is not The Hangover and it was never going to be, it's very different. Both movies have the same director and Galiafinakis acts in both movies but it shouldn't be seen as anything close to a sequel to The Hangover (in fact a sequel to that movie will be in theaters on May 26), it's a movie on its own. I found the unlikely pairing of Downey Jr. and Galifianakis to be a very effective one; in fact they almost complete each other by the end of the film. Both actors are so different but they go together really well and this makes for some funny situations. It seems some reviewers have a strong hate for this movie, I understand that it's not an excellent movie but it does have its moments and there are far worse movies than Due Date. I just don't get why some say it's the worst movie ever made, that's more than a bit harsh.

Architect Peter Highman (Downey Jr.) is headed home to Los Angeles to attend the birth of his first child. Ethan Tremblay (Galifianakis) is headed to Hollywood in order to become an actor and hopefully star in Two and a Half Men . The two meet as they are about to take the same flight and Ethan manages to get them both on the no-fly list. Ethan offers Peter a ride home and Peter has seemingly no choice but to accept and must overlook his hatred of Ethan during the trip. With the two characters being almost complete opposites there is bound to be some difficulties. Some situations in the film really are over the top but it's only a movie and its part of the fun. I certainly like the road trip aspect, we get to see beautiful scenery like the Grand Canyon. There's definitely some slapstick humor in the film and obviously some things that won't seem funny to every viewer (masturbating dog is comes to mind) and some will find it totally stupid and pointless.

I appreciated and enjoyed Due Date or what it was, a mindless fun movie. It wasn't meant to be a sequel to The Hangover, I think some viewers had the wrong idea of what to expect before watching and in the end maybe that hurt their perspective on Due Date. As I said earlier, this is by no means a great movie but it's an enjoyable one that has its moments. I don't regret watching it and I did find it funny. Reading other reviews I have come to the conclusion that this is a love it or hate it movie, and plenty of people hate it. It certainly isn't a 5 star performance but I don't think it's as awful as some are making it out to be, 3  stars for this one.",1301184000,,2600,4.227364185110664

For one thing, there is absolutely no chemistry between Downey and Galifin-arse-kiss! I say that only because he seems to be the ""It-Man"" in comedies ever since ""The Hangover"". Downey is very drab and overly serious. Zak makes attempts at comedy, often resulting in playing the crude-card to get a laugh, but the crudeness is just not funny, IMO.

This had as many 4-Star reviews as 1-Star reviews, until now! I am being a critic and I may be wrong. You may think it is funny while I think it is one of the worst movies of 2010! 500 million people don't all agree on everything!

4385516,4,B004I9SJFW,"Peter Highman (Robert Downey Jr) is an architect who's returning home after a business trip to witness the birth of his first child which is due in a week or less. Everything has been arranged, the airplane tickets are booked he just gotta go to the airport, set in his first class seat and viola ! However, things get pretty messed up when he unexpectedly bumps into a Pot head, inspiring actor Ethan Trembley (Zach Galifianakis) who wants to go to Hollywood. Not only does Ethan accidentally switch bags full of Marijuana with Peter. He also manages to get him kicked off the plane because of some lame joke about terrorist. Now Peter is pissed ! He can't fly cuz the airline company won't let him, he doesn't have his luggage, wallet or any money. He doesn't even have his license so he can't rent a car but he have to be in LA for the birth of his first baby, so what should he do ? The only solution. Ride with the man who was the reason for his misery.

O.K, I don't really know why people are ""comparing"" this with the Hangover I've seen that movie, I know it's been directed by the same person, it has Zach Galifianakis in it also and they are both road trip films except the Hangover only took place in Las Vegas while this manages to wander around between Kansas, Alabama, Mississippi, Texas, Arizona and eventually LA but come'on guys this movie couldn't be more different than the Hangover even if it tried.

I have to say I really felt bad for Peter in this movie, I mean Ethan really made him go through hell trying to get him to LA. Ethan was very hard to like at first, I mean he's kinda the geek, weirdo guy who's also a pot head and everyone is trying to ignore and needs a hair cut really bad but then I soften up a little for him. The part in the plane was really funny ! I kept on laughing at that. Another part that had me laughing out loud was the part where Peter was high and he imagined Ethan as a bear, that was soo funny ! There were also other funny moments too like the sleeping while driving thing and the dog sunny !

On top of that I thought the scenery was really beautiful, I mean you got to see the landscapes and even the Grand Canyon too, almost a year ago I went on a trip to the West Coast we went to see California, Las Vegas and the Grand Canyon so it kinda brought back memories for me. Another thing I liked about this movie was the soundtracks, the music they were listening to was awesome ! I really liked that.

Well, Of course if you picked this movie up you'd be expecting it as a Comedy it's not the next big thing or the Greatest Show On Earth it's just a Comedy pure and simple so If your gonna watch this movie I'd say the only way to enjoy it or at least try is by viewing it as something totally pure entertainment, your knowledge is not gonna get bigger your IQ is not gonna get higher, your life won't change but your gonna laugh just for the sake of it :)",1300924800,2,2913,4.159574468085107

I did expect that there might be one character with whom a reasonable person could connect. This isn't meant to be a film where one thinks too hard. This is not some arthouse film. The fundamental flaw is that Downey Jr. plays an unlikable jackass, mean and unsympathetic. His plight, to get cross-country to his pregnant wife in time for the birth of their child, is not the kind of life and death situation where most reasonable people would risk all. Galifianakis's character is just as unlikable. There's a moment or two when his backstory about his father's recent passing is relatively touching, but it doesn't last. His character is so irredeemably stupid, the plot would have been better if Downey was trying to get him across country to donate a kidney to his wife. Yes, I suggest his character's sum is less than the value of his body parts. I am being nice giving this 2 stars simply because despite the lame plot, poor character development and numerous other flaws, the acting is good and there are infrequently nice moments in the film. I turned it off before the end as it became clearer and clearer neither main character was going to die in some horrible manner, thereby forcing the other character to reevaluate his life and be a mensch.",1300838400,2,1342,4.690677966101695

4385524,5,B004I9SJFW,"This is a classic slapstick, tough luck comedy story involving a road trip from East to West coast.

In a nutshell: an expectant father is flying from ATL to LA when he crosses paths with a odd-ball guy who ends up getting them kicked off the airplane for suspicious behavior.  In the process, he ""loses"" his wallet and, by a mixture of circumstances, has to travel across the county with the same nutcase who got him thrown off the plane.  During the journey, they get into a mix of trouble.

What I liked:  Zach Zach Galifianakis is really funny throughout -- great scenes and acting.  The obliviousness to societal ""norms"" is what makes it funny.  As you see in the preview, Robert Downey Jr.'s character is telling a sad tale of his father leaving him as a child.  After hearing it, Galifianakis starts cracking up laughing and says something about how his father would never do that because he loved him.

Disliked:  Some of the craziness is overdone; needed more edgy scenes and clever ideas in some points of the film; the Mexico scene was a bit much.

Overall:  VERY GOOD for a mindless comedy.  If you liked Hangover, Wedding Crashers, Sex Drive, Road Trip, American Pie, etc., you'll probably enjoy it.  Fortunately, it doesn't go as far as Borat or Jackass in terms of shocking and grotesque humor.

And to describe some of the scenes to my friends, you would think it was a hilarious movie. So I'm pretty sure the writing was good, but the execution was off. The timing and the passion never seemed to click. Maybe having Downey Jr. as the straight guy was the problem. He seemed more mean that funny. Mean can be funny if given proper attention - Dr. Evil is quite funny, but he was vulnerable too. Downey's vulnerable side seemed fake so you never really cared about the character. Comedy is surely one of the hardest forms of acting to capture on film - you really have to commit to the character and the scene. This movie and the actors never really did that. There were a few funny moments, but in all it was a rather dull ride. What a shame. I really wanted to like this movie. Two popular actors cashing a check. That's all.",1300147200,,923,4.25

4385533,3,B004I9SJFW,"Todd Phillips needs to pay residuals to the late John Hughes for a complete theft of his plot for ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles.""  But while that movie was light and funny, and quite often genuinely from the heart, this movie aims below the belt, and is often dark and cruel.

The cool little twist to this movie (at least to me) is that Robert Downey Jr.'s Peter is very much a sarcastic prick.  Yeah, he earns it, since Galifianakis' character is so intolerable, but it's nice that Peter has an edge.

I think the problem is that even though the movie is occasionally funny, Galifianakis' behavior is beyond disgusting and repulsive, and yet the movie seemingly looks down at Peter for his reaction to it.  Whenever Peter lets loose to tell Galifianakis' Ethan what a slob he is, he either pays for it by being physically hurt or is forced to apologize.

What saves this movie is Downey Jr. -- because quite honestly, he's the one who has all the laughs.  For all the crazy behavior by Galifianakis, it's actually Downey who gets you laughing.  His wrinkle-faced expressions of disbelief are hilarious.

The movie goes into loony-tunes territory later on, when Peter and Ethan get into all sorts of illegal activity, and the movie conveniently fails to mention why they're not put in jail for the rest of their lives at the end of the film.

Michelle Monaghan (reuniting with ""Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang"" co-star Downey), Jamie Foxx (who almost doesn't seem to know why he's in the movie) and Juliette Lewis are completely forgettable and wasted.

What ""Due Date"" really is is just a cash-grab by Todd Phillips, who threw together the film with Galifianakis to capitalize on the success of ""The Hangover.""  But the film suffers from a slapdash feel.  You can sense them massaging out the script to make it to feature length.

I laughed until I cried while watching this movie-even during my second time seeing it in the theaters.

To me, this is an R rated comedy done right: it's a comedy written for adults, using adult language, in adult (albeit fantastical) situations. If you are looking for boobies, pseudo-porn, over-the-top gross humor, this is not the movie for you. If, on the other hand, you are looking for intelligent humor, mixed in with a low brow punch here and there, this is the movie for you. It's smart, keeps you on your toes, and unlike most comedies nowadays, didn't give away the best laughs in the trailers.

But even if you do prefer your comedies on the low-brow side, you'll probably love this movie. My dad, who raved about The Hangover and whose favorite movie is Dumb and Dumber, loved it. I think this comedy suffered from being R rated and not catering to the 18 year old male demographic. But it's too good to stay under the radar.

It's worth mentioning: RDJ is ridiculously good-looking eye-candy throughout this movie, even when he's been through heck and back. If you're an RDJ swooner, I'd recommend the movie for that reason alone.",1299024000,4,1372,4.610655737704918

It does kind of make sense in that Warner is trying to encourage people to buy rather than rent the movie and what you're getting here is the same disc that they're selling to the rental places.

Definitly not as funny as the hangover but still a decent attempt from director Todd Phillips. In all honesty I find all of his movies better than this other than starsky and hutch. Phillips has directed the movies road trip and old school as well so he's done a few good ones. Of course there were still things I laughed at during this film especially the part with Juliette Lewis, the part with Danny Mcbride the legless veteran and the wonderful Galifianakis who has become quite a charm ever since his breakout role in the hangover.

The movie itself was not bad it just was not anything too special. I honestly expected more from the film given all the talent on the set. It was like dinner for schmucks for me almost. There was lots of potential and talent from everyone involved in the movie just not amazingly executed. Overall a pretty good watch, but there are many funnier films out there. I hope I've been helpful.

Galifaianakis is hillarious in this movie.  I understand not everyone will appreciate his humor, and I think it boils down to; if you like Zach's humor, you will like this movie.  He's sort of created a persona in his last two major releases, Due Date, and The Hangover, where he is this dim witted, weird (but in a good, funny way), loner.

Outstanding: It was fun seeing Michelle Monaghan and RDJ in the same movie. It reminded me of Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang - a movie I loved. Even when he's working with a movie like this, Downey Jr. remains watchable.

Unacceptable: The jokes were strained and unfunny and there were so many loose ends I started to think there wasn't a rope. Gross out comedy has taken the place of wit.

4385557,4,B004I9SJFW,"DUE DATE isn't a grand bit of comedy, in the vein of THE HANGOVER, though it tries.  Instead, it's much smaller in scope, which actually has its benefits.  The film concerns the stuck-up Peter Highman (Downey Jr.), struggling to make the birth of his child.  Because of a misunderstanding on the airline, he is relegated to hitching a ride cross-country with Ethan Tremblay (Galifianakis).  Hi-jinks ensue.

Todd Phillips is retreading HANGOVER territory (before an actual sequel was developed, this film was referred to as ""Hangover 2""), but that's okay.  If you can get past the lack of originality, DUE DATE is actually quite enjoyable.  Downey Jr. and Galifianakis have great chemistry, and both are masters at this sort of comedy.  Michele Monaghan is grossly underused as Highman's wife, though it's great to see her and Downey Jr. reunited (remember KISS KISS BANG BANG?  You darn well should).  We also get supporting roles fro RZA, Jamie Foxx, Danny McBride, Juliette Lewis, and Jon Cryer and Charlie Sheen (in one of the most desperate, yet funniest, tie-ins ever).  The result is a crude, yet memorable comedy with some genuine heart (like all great comedians, Downey Jr. and Galifianakis are both great at finding the emotional center of their characters) and a whole lot of laughs.

Much like ""The Hangover"" this movie was a series of bad luck after bad luck.  This one though very funny was also very touching in many parts.  I will say that this movie does have what I call the ""Hype Syndrome"".  This means that the longer it takes to watch it, the more you hear about it and when you finally do it's built up so much it's not as good as you were expecting.  It is really funny, don't get me wrong.  I just think I would have liked it more if I haven't seen the preview for it 10 times a day (which about 75% of the funniest parts are in), and heard that it was the funniest movie ever.  Not really a new idea, two guys who don't know each other (one neat & one a slob) get stuck together for an extended amount of time.  But the two actors give it new life and it's fun to watch the two opposites play off each other.  I recommend it but tone down your expectations.  I give it a B+.

4385563,4,B004I9SJFW,"Following up The Hangover, Todd Phillips directs and co-writes Due Date, a road movie in the vein of Planes, Trains, and Automobiles. With the unlikely comedic duo of Robert Downey, Jr. and Zack Galifianakis leading the film and appearances by Danny McBride, Juliette Lewis, Jamie Foxx, and Michelle Monaghan, Due Date could have been something really special. While it's funny and entertaining enough, I couldn't help but think there could have been something...More.

Peter Highman (Downey, Jr.) is travelling from Atlanta to Los Angeles to be with his wife (Monaghan) while she delivers their first child. His troubles begin from the moment he arrives at the airport, where he first meets Ethan Tremblay (Galifianakis). Soon, he finds himself kicked off the plane, on the no-fly list, and with no way to rent a car because he's without his wallet. In a moment of desperation, Peter accepts a ride from Ethan, an aspiring actor, also on his way to California who offers to drive Peter to Los Angeles as well as pay for the whole trip.

If you've seen the trailer, you probably knew all of this. Ethan is an aspiring actor, who claims to be 23-years-old, is carrying his father's ashes in a coffee can, and travels with his dog Sonny. Some people assume Galifianakis is just recycling his character Alan from The Hangover. While there are similarities between Alan and Ethan, they share a similar flamboyant, stupid personality and, obviously the same actor but they are different characters. While Alan was more childlike, like a small boy trapped in the body of a grown man; Ethan just seems oblivious to his stupidity and the destruction he causes. Downey, Jr. plays the same egotistical and self-centered character he's been making his living from playing over the last few years (with a few notable exceptions, of course), except Peter lacks the charm of his usual ventures. Throughout the film, Peter tends to be a thoroughly unlikable character. In fact, Ethan is so stupid and Peter is so despicable that many people will not like this film based on that characterization alone.

Sort of uncharacteristic of a studio film, the movie is built on mean-spirited humor. Obviously mean-spirited humor comprises almost every comedy released in theatres today, but Due Date is much meaner than you'd think. In two scenes played for laughs, Downey, Jr. spits on a dog and punches a child. Some may find these scenes offensive, I found them to be some of the funniest moments in the movie. All of the comedy comes from situational humor and irreverent, funny one-liners and while some of these one-liners are very funny (""We split a six-pack...of 40's""), some fail at even being amusing (""He's a famous pirate. And his name was Shakesbeard""). There's also an oddly amusing sight gag, never before used in a movie before, to my knowledge, in the form of a masturbating dog.

The hilarious Danny McBride takes the spotlight away from the two leads in his brief, but hilarious scene as a Western Union clerk/Iraqi war veteran. Most of the bit roles are amusing, but considering the talent involved it should be much better than it is. I blame the script for this as it doesn't move through the plot so much as stumble through it. Every scene seems built on how bad Ethan can screw Peter over, with each scene trying to one-up the scene before it. Some have said its derivative of Planes, Trains, and Automobiles and, yes it has a similar structure, but plenty of movies have used this same premise since that film was released. However, Phillips and co. could have taken a few pointers from that film, specifically in the relationship between Peter and Ethan.

As a foil for Peter, Ethan probably gets Peter in more trouble than any character has before in a movie like this. In every movie of this sort, where the smart, successful protagonist about to reach his breaking point must team up with the simpleton there's usually a sense of companionship between the two even though one can't stand the other. While Peter is shown to have some compassion for Ethan, he seems to genuinely despise him and even tells him this several times. Downey, Jr. and Galifianakis share a strange comedic chemistry together and a gift for both deadpan and off-the-cuff one-liners, but they don't share a personal chemistry. It seems highly unlikely that Peter would ever befriend Ethan and when the film tries to give it heart, it just feels forced. Due Date could have benefitted from keeping it mean, going against the grain a bit, and keeping Peter the same throughout; people already don't like his character, so why try to make him a good person to no avail?

Due Date is no comedy classic and it lacks heart, but it has a cast that makes it worth watching. Downey, Jr. and Galifianakis are an unlikely, dysfunctional pair with such contrasting personalities that there's something fun in watching the two together. While many people will find it wholly unappealing, I was amused enough by it and it was a brisk 90-minute comedy that made me smile. My head is telling me to give it 3-stars, but as far as simple entertainment it warrants a 4-star rating. It's worth a rental, but don't expect something too memorable.

There other similarities that I don't want to give away. Anyway, I just found it mostly boring. There might have been maybe a few laughs here and there but it mostly seemed boring, recycled and unfunny to me but, hey judging by the number of positive reviews chance are you might like it.

4385565,3,B004I9SJFW,"The set-up is a familiar one. Two different people with wholly different personalities pair up and hit the road together. Misadventures ensue. It was effectively used in John Hughes-directed ""Planes, Trains & Automobiles"" with Steve Martin and John Candy. Part mismatched-buddy movie, part road movie, ""Due Date"" directed by Todd Phillips (""Road Trip"" ""Hangover"") employs the same format. The difference is the jokes are cruder, even violent, including masturbation, gunshot and car crashes (twice).

Because of a series of misunderstanding Peter Highman (Robert Downey Jr.) is put on a ""no fly"" list. Stranded in Atlanta, Peter has to come back to LA, where his pregnant wife Sarah (Michelle Monaghan) waits for him in hospital. With only five days to the due date, Peter has to hurry, so the high-strung architect reluctantly hitches a ride with Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis), a wannabe actor and avid fan of ""Two and a Half Men."" The problem is that everything Ethan (and his dog) does irritates Peter during the following cross-country ride.

Jokes are hit and miss - it depends on you - and though I enjoyed watching the film, I thought it was not as good as the same director's ""Hangover"" not because of the nature of the jokes - I like crude jokes - but because of the casting. I am not completely sure Robert Downey Jr. is the right choice for the role. Talented as he is, he seems a bit too ""in character,"" making some of the scenes too serious. His ""unlikable"" character of Peter IS really unlikable at some points.

Cameos from Jamie Foxx, Juliette Lewis, Danny McBride and RZA are mildly amusing, but not surprising as in ""Hangover."" Not that ""Due Date"" is a terrible movie. This is an enjoyable comedy, but not as hilarious as ""Hangover.""",1295740800,,1756,4.866220735785953

STARRING: Robert Downey Jr., Zack Galifianakis, Michelle Monaghan, Jamie Foxx, Juliette Lewis, Danny McBride, Todd Phillips and RZA

WRITTEN BY: Todd Phillips, Alan R. Cohen, Alan Freedland and Adam Sztykiel

DIRECTED BY: Todd Phillips

Rated: R
Genre: Comedy
Release Date: 05 November 2010
Review Date: 16 November 2010

Due Date is without question the funniest film of 2010, with only The Other Guys at its heels. What makes this ironic and fantastic is that the best comedy of last year was The Hangover and Todd Phillips directed both Due Date and The Hangover. Good for him and good for people who like to laugh. Oh, and he's doing The Hangover Part II next year; see a pattern?

I can help you very quickly in deciding if Due Date is a movie you will find amusing or not. I can do that with one simple question in fact, which is: Did you enjoy Planes, Trains and Automobiles? If you hated it, skip Due Date, if you loved it, you will love Due Date, and if you haven't seen it, then for God's sake - see both films this weekend!

Due Date is molded in one of the most generic but favorable story fashions in American cinema; it's a road trip movie. Why it does so well, is that it gives us a nice melody of both the things we love in road movies (i.e. vehicles getting destroyed, an overly eccentric character or two) as well as a handful of new psychotically humorous things we haven't seen.

Which brings me to the comedic genius that is the man, Zack Galifianakis; or Zack G, if you stumble over his name like I do. The guy is amazing. He makes things funny that if anyone else were to do, we would find repulsive or childishly immature and or simply not funny. As you might have guessed; Zack G gets to play the overly eccentric character; making up half the necessary equation in any buddy-pic or road movie, which Due Date is a perfect combination of.

So naturally we need our straight man, right? Of course! Our Steve Martin of Planes, Trains and Automobiles or our David Spade of Tommy Boy. Enter, Robert Downey Jr. Only this time around, the straight guy has a tick to him, in which he has all the vulgar one-liners and at times results to violence in trying circumstances. Awesome!

Downey plays an architect named Peter who is desperately trying to get home to his wife who will be having a C-section in a few days. But thanks to Ethan, a bearded repulsive weirdo (Zack G), Peter's plans are about to land in the dumpster. Ethan not only has both of them thrown off a plane when the two get into a spat, but Peter's name is added to a no-fly list. Road trip time, baby. But however can Peter get home to Los Angles, from Atlanta - when he's lost his wallet? Why, with Ethan in a rental car, of course.

Ethan is heading to LA with high hopes of becoming a successful actor. At one point he re-enacts a Brando monologue from The Godfather for two potheads. When asked if he wrote that, he tells them with bitter dumbfounded earnest, that it was written by the mafia. He also tells people he's allergic to waffles and that he's 23 years old; Zack G is 41, mind you. You can imagine the looks that Downey gives his character Peter, in response to some of Ethan's comments, and they're as good as gold. Oh, yes - and wait till you see Ethan's headshots; priceless.

Roger Ebert wrote in his 2  star review of this film, that the fact that Ethan decides to freely masturbate in the car with Peter sitting next to him trying to sleep, was not funny. I can't disagree with him more on this. I can at least admit that in plain text such as this, it may not sound all that humorous, but it was hysterical and Zack G's performance of doing so, and Robert Downey's reaction, made up one sensational scene! At least Ebert and I agreed that it WAS funny when Ethan's small dog mimics him at this. Good for you, Ebe!

To tell anymore would be to spoil a real treat at the theater, folks. Its 95 minutes with two talented actors, doing hilarious things in the course of a well written and directed film. Ethan is a sweet but creepy man-child and Peter is an A-hole who is aware of it, and trying to fix it. Ethan adores Peter and Peter is crushing every bone in his body, in an effort to resist the urge to strangle Ethan. This is what makes the film magical. We care about them and want to see where their crazy relationship will take them by the end of their trip to LA.

Due Date is wild and zany and it's got Michelle Monaghan, Jamie Foxx and Juliet Lewis in it too. What else do you need to know?",1293580800,,4514,4.331753554502369

I don't know why I should have paid attention to their review because they also said ""Piranha"" was so good they were giving it four stars.  Worst movie of all time, worth only a negative amount of stars. In ""Due Date"" Robert Downey, Jr. plays his part without hitting one false note and Zach G. is fabulous also.  The writers who conjured up the situations these two get into will hopefully continue to write many more such gems.  There is only one little gross episode but it quickly passes and the rest of the movie is great.",1291852800,2,794,4.36734693877551
4385569,4,B004I9SJFW,"I saw this a couple of days ago. It's a completely forgettable movie with barely a memory-embedding moment in it. But it did hold my interest and I laughed throughout.

I actually enjoyed Robert Downey Jr. in this movie more than anything I've ever seen him in. I ""got""  his straight-laced attitude, his conflict, his character (in a way, I could have imagined the role being played by Hugh Laurie of House fame). Zach Galifianakis is an actor I'm not familiar with but he was funny too.

The set-up is thus: Downey and Galifianakis are both strangers taking the same plane from LA to New York together, and through some unfortunate conversation they both end up getting kicked off the plane as suspected terrorists and put on a no-fly list. Downey's wife is going to have a baby in 3 days, so he needs to get back across the country desperately. But in the incident, he also lost his wallet. Downey is considering stealing a car, when Galifianakis drives by and offers to give Downey a ride. Downey would rather do anything in the world than ride with Galifianakis, who's been established as a goofy, well-meaning, but annoying imbecile, and who drives Downey nuts. But Downey sees no other choice. After a moment of agonizing indecision, he gets in the car.

The rest of the movie is just funny bits involving Galifianakis needing to make detours to buy some marijuana for his glaucoma (Downey's character has never taken a toke in his life), Downey having to deal with Galifianakis' unsanitary method of making himself sleepy at night, Galifianakis' tendency to fall asleep at the wheel, and Downey's attempts to escape from Galifianakis and sometimes feeling like a heel for doing so.

The questions are: Will Downey get to his wife in time before she gives birth? Will he escape from Galifianakis, or will they become friends after this 3-day ordeal? Is Downey's baby going to be black? (Downey's best friend in the movie is played by Jamie Foxx, who also used to date Downey's wife, played by Michelle Monaghan, and 9 months ago spent some ""secret"" time with her.)

A funny buddy movie based on the premise of complete opposites being forced to be together, but without any lasting messages or points to take home.

4385570,2,B004I9SJFW,"Maybe Todd Phillips set the bar too high with his previous comedy,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hangover/dp/B003VQZ4OW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hangover</a>. That movie was too funny, too phenomenal for words. Even a lot of the previous films in 2009 that I loved (more serious ones too) look inferior held up by comparison.

That said, the reviews are right in saying that this is basically a remake of Planes Trains and Automobiles. The only difference is that instead of a Thanksgiving dinner, they're trying to get home to a birth. I'd have thought that it would be hard to screw up a comedy that was directed by Phillips and had Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifinakis in it. I was sold before I even heard a single plot detail.

The film is basically about a man trying to get home in time for the birth of his child. After a brief stint by Galifinakis' character that gets them banned from flying with the airline permanently, this leads to him having to hitchhike the way there... as long as he doesn't kill him first.

Overall, There were a few good laughs. The first 20 minutes had me on the floor. And then... it just sorta... repeated. There wasn't enough plot to advance the humor, which is a major problem- you'd expect a film with a plot as unoriginal as that to have some funny stuff, but really, all the funny stuff is in the trailer, and towards the end I just wanted the movie to shut up already.

Overall, worth a rent I guess. But don't buy or pay to see it in the theatre.",1290988800,5,1549,4.768656716417911
4385571,3,B004I9SJFW,"Robert Downey Jr. teams up with the star and the director of The Hangover - Zach Galifianakis and Todd Phillips - for the road comedy Due Date.

When two people get into an argument on an airplane, they find themselves on the ""no-fly"" list, having to make other arrangements to get from Atlanta to Los Angeles. One of these people is a no nonsense businessman and father to be, Peter Highman (Downey Jr.), and the other is a grieving yet oddly upbeat aspiring actor Ethan Tremblay (Galifianakis). Through a series of ""leave your brain at the door to enjoy"" happenings, the two decide to travel cross country together attempting to arrive at the LA hospital in time for the birth of Highman's baby. This isn't Homer's Odyssey by any means, but the two do cross paths with numerous interesting characters and learn more about each other along the way.

While the film really never goes anywhere, being stuck in neutral with the perfect straight guy absorbing jokes from one of Hollywood's new leading funny guys, there are many worse ways to spend your time at the movies. There are more holes in the storyline than I could count, and law enforcement is seemingly non-existent after the first ten minutes of the movie, but again, I still found myself laughing quite a bit. And for all of the R-rated comedies released in the past few years, this is one of the cleanest of the bunch (but it still earns it's R rating.)

Overall, I would recommend this flick to those just looking to laugh. It's not complex, not award-worthy, not going to blow you away - but it is going to make you laugh for the better part of 90 minutes.",1290211200,,1620,4.5793103448275865
4385572,1,B004I9SJFW,"""Due Date"" is a hugely disappointing film. Todd Phillip's follow-up to ""The Hangover"", one of the funniest films in recent memory, relies on an oft-copied formula and the basic conceit that everyone in the story is one-dimensional and pretty stupid. These two problems add up to ""create"" (har, har!) a miserable little film experience.

Peter Highman (Robert Downey, Jr.) is an architect currently working on assignment in Atlanta. He and his wife (Michelle Monaghan) are pregnant; Peter  is the type of uptight guy who can come up with a reason to reject everyone of his wife's baby name choices. Scheduled to fly home the next day, Peter has left plenty of cushion for the baby's birth on Friday. But Peter bumps in to Ethan Tremblay (Zach Galifianakis), literally, as soon as they both arrive at the airport. Before you can say ""Homeland Security"", both men, who are naturally on the same flight to Los Angeles, get bumped off the flight and further circumstances conspire to keep them grounded. They end up sharing a rental car for the long drive from Atlanta to Los Angeles. Or Hollywood as Ethan, an actor headed to an important audition, keeps referring to it.

This film should've been called ""Planes, Automobiles and even more Automobiles"". How many times can they remake the seminal John Hughes film? In fact, if I remember correctly, Steve Martin also played an architect. I guess in Hollywood-speak, architect equals uptight and anal which is a necessary trait for one half of the duo to make this concept work. At least, it is necessary if you want to put as little thought as possible into the creation of a film.

Downey is basically the straight man. Because he is so uptight and anal, every moment Peter and Ethan are on the road, confined together is a rental car, will test him, making him wince, cringe or get inpatient. In a better film, most of these moments would be new and original. In ""Due Date"", many of these moments seem recycled, often from earlier moments. And this just makes the movie seem longer and more problematic.

As the straight man, Downey simply has to react to Galifianakis' shenanigans. But to make Peter work, we have to like his character. Or at least care about him. But because all he does is react, usually in mean ways, to his road trip partner, we never have the chance or a reason to give a flying fig about the uptight architect. Granted, Ethan does extremely annoying things, but because we don't care about Peter, his tormentor seems like a saint.

Galifianakis comes closest to making us care about this stereotype than anyone has come since John Candy. He has the same sort of nave innocence about him, a certain clueless, endearing quality that helps us learn to care about him, no matter how stupid he may be. He first appears wearing a Lilith Fair t-shirt, a scarf and pants that may be two sizes too small. Then, we notice his perm (as do many others they interact with). His oddball appearance seems sweet and natural for his character. But this quality quickly wears thin and he often simply becomes annoying; Part of the reason for this is his decisions seem so random. This trait also robs Ethan of any empathy/ Because he is so annoying, when he does do something amusing, we can't see it or enjoy it.

Practically everything in this film that is supposed to be funny happens because every character excercises no common sense. Without even the smallest bit of reality, we can't identify with anyone and nothing is funny. For instance, when Peter moves through security at the Atlanta airport, he is stopped for a search and the TSA agent (RZA) finds a marijuana pipe in his bag. After a brief exchange, we next join up with Peter on the airplane as everyone else is boarding. Huh? In what world?

In addition to RZA, Juliette Lewis, Danny McBride and Jamie Foxx pop up for brief cameos. Because of the nature of this film, Peter and Ethan traveling cross-country, they will meet and interact with people, but these interactions will be brief. The filmmakers include these moments to put a new obstacle in the path of the main characters, to infuse some new humor into the story. But these moments are, as stated, brief, and in ""Due Date"", none of them work. ""Borat"" is a recent, better example of this same idea.

I'm not sure why someone like Jamie Foxx would do such a small, insignificant role. He is a better and funnier actor than this material. What does it do for his career? Fill some time, pay for a small portion of his house? I don't get it.

However, for RZA, Lewis and McBride, their participation makes sense. Each gets a moment, hopefully a funny showcase in the new film by the director of ""The Hangover"". If the cameo works, maybe a career is resurrected, more work is offered. Guys, I wouldn't count on anything coming from your participation in this project.

Maybe the worst problem with ""Due"" is it just has no new ideas. It even seems to run out of stean and they begin to recycle confrontations and ideas from earlier in the film.

If ""Due Date"" were funny, all of this could be forgiven. Every year, the best dramas receive the highest praise and the most awards. But as any comedian will tell you, making a good comedy is a very hard thing to do. When they work, they should receive equal praise. Given the number of truly funny films we get to see every year, this theory would seem to be true. Something, somewhere wasn't clicking during the production of ""Due Date"". Making a good comedy is very hard indeed.",1289952000,9,5503,4.644398766700925
4385573,4,B004I9SJFW,"I thought this movie was very funny and packed with the right amount of comedy. It's very similar to 'Planes, Trains, and Automobiles' Robert Downey Jr. and Zach Galifianakis were perfect together. Downey Jr. stars as Peter Highman, a man on his way home to Los Angeles to be there for the birth of his child. Unfortunately, he runs into Ethan Tremblay, who soon becomes a nightmare for Peter. They switch bags on the plane, and both get put on the no-fly list. When Ethan rents a car, he offers Peter a ride, and he reluctantly accepts. Along the way, Ethan asks him strange questions and continues to bother Peter. They get injured, and almost thrown in jail in Mexico. Will Peter get to L.A. in time for the birth of his child? I highly recommend DUE DATE!!!",1289347200,,761,4.521739130434782
4385574,3,B004I9SJFW,"but it doesn't come close to ""Planes and Trains"". These characters are neither likable nor sympatheic, pathetic, yes. These guys are not nice. You would run from them. To sit with them thru the movie is difficult. A couple of laughs keep you in your seat, but I can't see rewatching this one.",1289347200,,292,4.528301886792453
4385575,3,B004I9SJFW,"At the start of ""Due Date,"" Robert Downey, Jr.'s character leaves a message on his pregnant wife's cell phone. He describes a dream he had, one in which a bear chews through his child's umbilical cord immediately after the birth. By the end of the film, he becomes convinced that the dream was prophetic. I became convinced he was deluding himself - or, more accurately, the filmmakers were deluding themselves into believing they had actually pulled off a display of twisted symbolism. The only thing they pull off is an act of desperate contrivance, which comes in the form of an oddity played by Zach Galifianakis. No, not a character. An oddity. When the moment comes and the dream is interpreted, I sank in my seat, realizing that I had endured nearly 100 minutes of lowbrow humor for nothing. There's no payoff, apart from more oddness.

""Due Date"" is directed by Todd Phillips, who a year ago helmed ""The Hangover"" to tremendous box office and critical acclaim. I admit that the film never appealed to my sense of humor, but at least it had an engaging story. Not only does ""Due Date"" suffer from a plot that's neither original nor interesting, it's also a nonstop barrage of unappealing physical and verbal gags. Many of these are given to Galifianakis, whose character doesn't even work within the context of a vulgar road trip buddy comedy; he's a bizarre goofball caricature that plays on one note - a man defined solely by flat, tiresome, scene-killing quirks. He's so thoroughly off-putting, it's impossible to believe anyone could grow to love him as a friend. In real life, a man like this would be committed to a sanitarium and forced to undergo extensive psychological testing.

Downey plays Los Angeles architect Peter Highman, a father-to-be excited to fly home from Atlanta in time for his child's birth. As soon as he arrives at the airport, he crosses paths with the over-the-top Ethan Tremblay (Galifianakis), who, as it turns out, is also on his way to Los Angeles. Specifically, he's on his way to Hollywood; he's an aspiring actor who dreams of making an appearance on ""Two and a Half Men."" An unlikely luggage mix-up forces both Peter and Ethan off the plane and onto a no-fly list. This forces Peter into hitching a ride with Ethan and his beloved pet dog, Sonny, in a rented car. Thus begins a madcap, disaster ridden cross-country journey, highlighted by such pleasant visuals as the dog masturbating, Peter getting beaten by a surly paraplegic veteran, and Peter punching a young boy in the chest. We're also treated to a run in with corrupt Mexican border-patrol officers, resulting in a car chase that miraculously resolves itself as soon as the scene ends.

Ethan is developed on nothing other than his ability to drive Peter and everyone else he comes into contact with insane. He has no social skills. He's immature, pretty much to the point where it's obvious he has a mental disorder. He regularly smokes marijuana, which he claims is for glaucoma. He dresses like a bum who robbed a thrift store. He has a curious habit of asking incredibly stupid questions, saying the wrong thing at the wrong time, and spouting facts and figures that are wrong. He carries his father's ashes in a coffee can. He parades his dog around as if the poor little thing were actually a human friend. He's so utterly unlikable that I simply didn't buy the idea that Peter could ever come to accept him. Perhaps Galifianakis is qualified to play a role like this, but to be perfectly frank, I'm getting tired of seeing him play the same eccentric loony he has been playing pretty much his entire career.

This leaves Downey. While playing the hapless straight man allowed me to like his character a lot more than Galifianakis', I'm wondering if that ultimately contributed to the film's unappealing tone. Comedy has thrived on mismatching (Laurel and Hardy, Abbot and Costello, Martin and Lewis), but here, it doesn't feel like a calculated move so much as an unfortunate misdirection. Downey and Galifianakis are so completely ill-fitting together that absolutely nothing they say or do registers as funny - it merely registers as awkward.

The same can be said about the story, which draws in the audience not through a genuinely intriguing series of events but by appealing to our inner immature teenager. Crude movies can be hilariously enjoyable, but there has to be something more to it other than crudeness, if you get my meaning; there needs to be an engaging plot, good characters, and a clever screenplay. This movie falls short in every respect. Consider a brief subplot involving Jamie Foxx, who plays Peter's best friend. When Peter suspects him of something terrible, we expect it to be integral to the rest of the film. But it isn't. In fact, it's resolved almost as soon as it begins. That begs the question of why this particular subplot was included in the first place. I suspect it was only because it gave Downey and Foxx the chance to work together again following ""The Soloist."" ""Due Date"" tries and tries hard, but unfortunately, it just doesn't have what it takes to be a comedy classic.",1289260800,,5127,4.801812004530011
4385576,5,B004I9SJFW,"I am already looking forward to the DVD release!! I will probably go back to see it again on the big screen in the meantime. Some compare it to the classic ""Planes, Trains and Automobiles"". It does have a few things in common with that great comedy, but ""Due Date"" is definitely more than capable of standing on its own merits. If anything, it is even funnier and more outrageous because in many ways it is much more realistic. There are some elements of ""boy humor"" that may offend some, but no more so than many films being made these days.
