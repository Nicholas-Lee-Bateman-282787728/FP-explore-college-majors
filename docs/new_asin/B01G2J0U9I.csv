7753606,4,B01G2J0U9I,"""The Fits"" (2015 release; 72 min.) brings the story of Toni, an 11 yr. old girl. As the movie opens, we see Toni doing push-ups and working out in the boxing gym alongside her older brother. But afterwards she watches a nearby dancer troupe doing their workouts, and it's clear Toni wants to join them. Toni's brother encourages her and it's not long before Toni enters a whole new (dancing) world. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: this is the debut full-length feature from writer-director Anna Rose Holmer. Here she picks a familiar topic (coming of age, fitting in and social acceptance), but Holmer brings it in a unique way, focusing on an 11 yr. old girl whom we watch as she tries to find her way. There is no dialogue to speak of during the first 20-25 minutes of the movie. Instead, we decipher all we need to know from Toni's face and body expressions. Newcomer Royalty Hightower as Toni as an absolute sensation. Did I mention that the entire cast of this film is African-American? (Interestingly, Holmer herself is not.) The movie is set entirely in Cincinnati's gritty West End neighborhood (much of the film being set at the West End's Lincoln Community Center, not far from Union Terminal). As a complete aside, I also noticed in the opening credits that the movie is ""Presented by the Biennale di Venezia"", yes, the famous arts fest. Bottom line: ""The Fits"" is an abstract, yet very real comment on a young girl's coming of age, dealing with social acceptance and related challenges.

The movie opened recently at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati. The Tuesday evening screening where I saw this at was PACKED, to my great (but pleasant) surprise. The fact the movie was shot here surely had a lot to due with that. Equally surprising was to see how many young kids were in the audience. If you are on the fence, perhaps because the movie's short running time, please do yourself a favor and check this out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. You will thank me later.",1467072000,13,2137,4.665782493368701

There were little things in this movie with which I identified: having that pent-up energy as a girl, the giggling, the joy of moving, of putting on the costumes wearing pierced earrings for the first time. The performances were fantastic, especially from Hightower, who conveyed so much with so few words, a look, a sigh, a gesture. This was a subtle and almost imperceptible coming of age story.",1495238400,,439,4.714285714285714

7753614,5,B01G2J0U9I,"The Fits features a cast of amateurs from theinner city schools in Cincinnati- but you'd never know it from their utterly natural, convincing acting and equally convincing story line.  11 year old Tony (Royalty Hightower) is a tom-boy on the cusp of adolescence. She's athletic (her big brother gives her boxing lessons), sweetand completely captivating. She's also trying to figure out what the next stage of her life is all about becauseshe sees the older girls flirting and acting sexy and knows that somehow she's headed there soon but doesn't quite understand how or why. She alsoseesthe older girls in a most beguiling hip hop dance troupe, The Lionesses(played by the real life Q Kidz)and she wants in! Forget the boxing, she wants to dance with the big kids!

At the same time as all this is going on the dance troupe suffers from some kind of weird mass hysteria. Suddenly and without explanation, girls come down with the ""fits"" -like a seizure followed by fainting spells. Frankly, this plot element is never really explained.

It is almost impossible to convey the charms of this movie or its star, Royalty Hightower, not to mention the joie de vivre of the its other star, the Q Kidz dance troupe.",1491004800,,1210,4.8076923076923075

(Spoiler coming)  Turns out, you never find out.  The basic plot -- the heroine of the story goes on to discover her real goal of becoming a tom-girl and not a tom-boy.  Well acted but is it worth the 1.5 hours+.

7753651,4,B01G2J0U9I,"Yup: if you loved The Tree of Life, see this ASAP; if not, skip it. This is pure arthouse: superb direction, cinematography, and editing, very fine score, sometimes slow pace (enlivened by some dance action), and a very slight story. The two lead performances are very good, the others perfunctory (they're all non-professionals).

For arthouse fans, the 5th star is going to depend on how much metaphorical meaning you draw from the title phenomenon. For me, the film left too many dots for the viewer to connect (which is to say, all of them). The ""fits"" would have seemed more meaningful to me had the elements of the story that they seem to symbolize (coming of age, the need to conform to one's peers while remaining an individual, etc.) been fleshed out more in the literal story. As it is, they stand in for these themes rather than connecting to them (since they're not much there to connect to). I can understand why some arthouse fans would rather have it the other way around, though.

In the meantime, this is a stunning directorial debut, in terms of behind-the-camera talent. There are images as breathtaking as anything you're likely to see this year.",1483401600,4,1166,4.767326732673268

Rating 1.5 out of 5.0

Who is Anna Rose Holmer? Well she's the writer and director of a 72 minute indie by the name of the ""The Fits,"" which inexplicably has garnered a slew of accolades from a host of major critics. Like many fledgling indie directors, Holmer shows great promise in the technical area of filmmaking and The Fits doesn't disappoint when it comes to some great editing and cinematography. But as far as screen writing, Holmer doesn't have a clue how to develop characters or construct a plot featuring a modicum of suspense.

Holmer's narrative is mainly shot in an inner city community center in Cincinnati, and her protagonist is one Toni, played by 11 year old Royalty Hightower, whom the critics have taken under their wing as cinema's next great child actor (I won't speculate as to why this has come to beonly to throw in my two cents that this is a young girl who lacks the requisite charm for placement in the pantheon of young, precocious, cinematic talent).

The plot here (if there is one) concerns Toni's desire to join the Lionesses Dance Team, an all female pre-pubescent/teenage dance group that specializes in competitive dance drills. Toni finally makes the team, despite opposition from two older girls, who dislike outsiders infringing on their turf.

In addition to the focus on choreography, there's the artificial intrusion of a plot point concerning some of the girls felled by seizures, fainting spells, which may or may not be blamed on contaminated drinking water inside the gym. The introduction of the ""Fits""the aforementioned seizuresdoes little to evoke suspense and awkwardly attempts to link the film's narrative to the horror genre.

What then has captivated the critics about this very slight bauble of a film? Ty Burr, writing in the Boston Globe describes Toni's experience as a ""rite of passage""she's particularly impressed with a scene such as this one for some reason: "" Toni piercing her ears in the community center's bathroom as her friends comment and help out.""

The NY Times critic, Mahnola Dargis, likes it because it's free of controversy: ""The miracle of the movie is that, like Toni, it transcends blunt, reductive categorization partly because it's free of political sloganeering, finger wagging and force-fed lessons.""

Noel Murray writing in the A.V. Club feels that Toni's ""awkward puberty"" is a revelation: ""For Toni, who practices and practicesfruitlesslyto move as gracefully and throw shade as fiercely as her peers, this new level of badass womanhood represents something else she may never be able to attain. The best she can do is to keep honing her own private, personal hybrid of fighting and stepping, while waiting for some inexplicable external force to define who she's going to be.""

Only Nikola Grozdanovic in IndieWire is on to something when he writes that Holmer is walking a very thin line between ""special"" and ""disposable."" Grozdanovic is perhaps the only brave enough critic to draw this damning conclusion about The Fits: "" The emotional investment, fully rounded characters, and engaging events that are needed to make the film work on all fronts simply isn't there. Three writers (Holmer, Saela Davis, and Lisa Kjerluff) are credited for what turns out to be the film's Achilles' heel; and at some point on the way, it gets irreparably sprained.""

When all is said and done, The Fits is really a documentary masquerading as a short feature film. The subject matter is so slight that I wonder why its director was drawn to it in the first place. Director Holmer is guilty of perhaps a neophyte's hubris. With all the good scripts out there, why not work with someone who has an established track record or an exceptionally talented newcomer? Instead, it's the old indie film canarda technical virtuoso attempting to develop a visually impressive but inert, intellectually barren script.",1482624000,,3921,5.018461538461539

In yet another remarkable first time performance by a child, Royalty Hightower, age 9, plays Toni the youngest member of an energetic dance troupe. The entire movie takes place in the neutral spaces of a community center. Toni looks in on her peers who periodically seem to suffer from strange fits. Other dancers will suddenly begin twist and spasm as though possessed, but there is little follow-up and no cause given. We watch Toni watching. A haunting soundtrack adds an ominous atmosphere, but this is not at all a horror film.  Dancing as an art form is enormously competitive and physically taxing. The film catches frenzy of dance at the same time it transposes the anxieties of the changing body, desires, insecurities, and limits of adolescence into the realm of the fantastical. The only white characters are the instructors, and they are kept at a blurred distance. This is a unique, haunting and strangely liberating film.",1481500800,,1044,5.069767441860465

-The acting was fantastic!  I love movies with unknown and amazing talent.  One of the interesting things about the acting was that you only really ever got to see and hear from the teens in the movie.  All the adults are nameless, faceless (mostly), and all around useless/unimportant.  That was very novel and interesting to watch that way.
-Fascinating plot with very little dialogue.
-Simplistic yet stunning directing and filming.  The simplicity made everything that happened in the film important.  Example: The main character Toni will just be walking in a scene and the camera will be focused on her, but there is so much going on in the background all the time. Keeping the camera focused on her even when she isn't doing anything except walking, gives the viewer time to notice what is going on in the background.

Why I just can't give this more stars:
-Too short!  I normally don't notice how long a movie is, but this was so short that it felt like the movie wasn't over yet.
-What is happening? Why is it happening? Why just girls? What was the dance scene towards the end? Is the theme about fitting in? Is it supernatural? Is it coming of age? ENDLESS questions!  I generally enjoy movies that leave the viewer with questions and that make the viewer think, but this one was SO open ended it was frustrating.  There was pretty much zero closure.  WARNING SPOILERS: You think you know what is going on towards the beginning; the girls are pregnant and are suffering the side effects in an extreme way. As the movie continues, all the girls, even the ones too young to be pregnant get the fits (did they all just get their period? Yet ANOTHER question).  Then Toni has a vision, floats towards the other girl, then also has a fit.  Finish the movie with a slight smile and a confused look on my face.

I would love if a film professional could examine this movie, because I think there is more going on than my tiny brain can understand.  Overall, fantastic movie but I'm not so sure it will be on my repeat watching list.",1514160000,,2068,4.536388140161725
8762170,4,B01G2J0U9I,Would a girl with a lot of talent and energy prefer to be a boxer or a dancer? In this case youll have to watch to find out but its really entertaining to see how it happens. I was a little lost on as the group begins to suffer from fainting spells and other violent seizures part but it became pretty clear as to what was happening toward the end. Some humor along the way and no gratuitous sex or violence was required.,1508544000,,421,4.0843373493975905
8762171,4,B01G2J0U9I,"I liked this a lot. A bit of Black Swan, a bit of Picnic at Hanging Rock, but with a documentary-like exploration of a world I know nothing about. Efficient, too, at hardly more than an hour in length.",1505606400,,201,4.17948717948718
8762172,2,B01G2J0U9I,"The premise of this film intrigued me; combined with the positive reviews, I was eager to watch it. Sigh. Well, film had tremendous potential: a coming-of-age story featuring an African-American cast. Yes! Unfortunately ""The Fits"" lacked cohesiveness, backstory, and dialogue that could have greatly enhanced it. I was so bored watching this, waiting for something to develop. Also, I did not care about Toni, the protagonist. And Toni did not seem to care about the fate of her teammates as they had ""fits."" Boredom/frustration marred her features too often. For me, too much effort was put into making the film artsy and metaphorical. My biggest question is: Would this film appeal to pre-teen/teenage girls?
The two stars are for the natural acting ability of the cast and the vision of Anna Rose Holmer.",1505088000,,807,5.075187969924812
