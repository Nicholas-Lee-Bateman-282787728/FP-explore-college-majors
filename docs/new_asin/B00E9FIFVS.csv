5897987,2,B00E9FIFVS,I prefer the 1959 Charlton Heston version. There's a reason that the 1959 Ben-Hur garnered so many awards. It's that good. Hollywood is ruining the classics. What's next? The remake of Cleopatra? The younger generation doesn't know what its' missing. I'll keep my older movies or read the book.,1471824000,4,294,5.020408163265306
5897988,1,B00E9FIFVS,This movie was pathetic. It should not even bear the same name as the 1959 movie. I wish I had my money backl.,1471824000,10,110,3.8260869565217392
5897989,4,B00E9FIFVS,"It hardly seems fair to the makers of this film to say anything negative about it because everyone who has ever adapted Lew Wallace's 1880 novel is in for some seriously hard graft. First off, it's a sweeping historical epic that requires convincing locations and a huge cast. Next, this is the fifth big screen adaptation of the novel and it is obviously going to be compared to the others. The serious competition comes from William Wyler's 1959 version which starred Charlton Heston and won a squillion Academy Awards. And because all the adaptations essentially follow the same story, it is very difficult to do anything other than tell a story about a dude who gets shanghaied onto a slave galley and returns to seek revenge culminating in a chariot race.

The production challenges additionally include the fact that the chariot race is the bit that everyone always remembers the most and was based on actual historical chariot races that were held in a real place in Rome (Circus Maximus) that every tourist to Rome knows well and yet which the Rome authorities won't allow film makers to use for chariot race movies - you can sort of see their point. So you have to go somewhere else to shoot your chariot race. This film goes to lots of places to create the right look and feel for its locations and on top of that uses plenty of CGI which works OK. Although inevitably, like most people I suspect, I am bound to say that the 1959 film, which obviously didn't have CGI available to it, looks much better to my eye.

For me the biggest problem with this film, noble effort that it is, is simply that it cannot compare to that 1959 version. This new version's budget although it was 6 times the budget of the 1959 version, when adjusted for inflation etc., doesn't come anywhere near to enjoying the lavish resources that were available to William Wyler's. It would have taken a James Cameron-sized budget to match the 1959 budget, a commercial impossibility given the inevitably and predictably luke warm reception given to this version. In the end, you almost have to ask yourself why they bothered. That said, it's a good effort with a solid cast who give their very best. Superior camera technology (like masses of go-pros buried in the dirt for the chariot race) does give this new version a different look. But I cannot really detect any meaningfully new interpretation of the original text - and nor should there be - the original story as written is just fine.

You may or may not enjoy this version. If you do enjoy it, you will probably be in a minority as, at the time of writing, its poor budget-to-box office performance singles it out as a resounding commercial flop. But if you are fan of the period with its heavily religiously-themed back story and you love exciting chariot races then you may well enjoy this production. For me, it's a worthy 4 stars for having the guts to tackle a massive canvas movie.",1471824000,5,2929,4.639691714836223
5897990,5,B00E9FIFVS,"Just came back from seeing Ben-Hur!  Best movie I saw this year.  The 59 version was somewhat uneven, parts were epic, but others not so much.  This movie was smoother and the story of forgiveness communicated much more clearly.  Certainly a message needed for this generation.",1471564800,7,277,4.956521739130435
5897991,5,B00E9FIFVS,"Ben-Hur is a classic double-millennial historical adventure epic (1st century) that began as a novel. The first adaptation was a silent movie.  Charlton Heston put Ben-Hur on the map in the 1959 movie, a towering screen presentation that has helduntil now. Jack Hustons rendition of Judah Ben-Hur is equally compelling, but this 2016 release has the advantage of over half a century of cinema technology advancement. It shows, and it creates superior viewing, and its breathtaking. I already knew the story so found no failings for this film.

The screenplay writers (Keith R Clarke & John Ridley) held true to the original storyline of the Indiana Civil War General Lew Wallace novel titled Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ released in 1880. Id guess Wallace, who turned writer after retiring from the military, would approve of this new explosive adaptation released during Indianas Bicentennial. This film shows some darkness of Roman Era life, but also adds romance, and recognizes Jewish and Zealot (Christian) faith principles without bashing. The wrongness of slavery is addressed as appropriately gruesome. Likely even Heston would say Well done, wish we had those film capabilities in my acting hay-day.

The cinematography is exquisite and enhanced with some over-the-top CG and special effects. Breathtaking action occurs in chariot racing, shipwreck, and more. There are well developed characters portrayed by skilled acting, only two I found quickly recognizable, Huston and Morgan Freeman as Ilderim. The success of this film is in the story and the overall presentation, not individual actors selling the film. Even the music is worthy of owning separately. Props and sets are Roman era authentic. Having owned the book, former DVD, I had to see this new, and Im glad I did. I was rewarded with a thrilling big-screen ride. Ill be buying the DVD eventually.
I gasped, ducked, cheered, smiled, and gripped the seat armand exited the cinema thrilled.",1471564800,25,1960,5.215873015873016
5897992,4,B00E9FIFVS,"Although no match for the silent version, this was satisfactory mainly due to the star's performance and its changes plot-wise.

5897998,5,B00E9FIFVS,"The original Ben-Hur movie has been on my favorite movie list since I was 10 and first saw it. This movie keeps all the most important points of the original, but provides an updated view of the classic story.

One complaint I have is that it separates the story of Ben-Hur from the parallel story of Christ, other than a few convergences. However, that is a fault of the original novel more than the film-makers, so I won't hold it against them.

I showed this movie to my English class at the university where I teach (in Haiti, so ESL students). It's a great ESL movie, because the dialogue is not overly complex, and is supported by the drama. And the action keeps their attention quite well.

It also helps that it comes with French, English, and Spanish subtitles. When I show it on a weekend, making it open to the whole campus, I'll play it in English with French subtitles so that even those who are not very good in English will benefit. But for my English 1 class, I might show it in English with English subtitles. This is a great aid for learning English. I'm really glad I bought this movie!",1526083200,,1105,4.4068627450980395

5898001,1,B00E9FIFVS,"This knockoff of the 1959 classic fails to engage the viewer's attention at any point. The central characters are dull and uninteresting due to the uncharismatic actors and the predictable dialogue. Morgan Freeman serves as a sort of Yoda here, advising the protagonist with trite and banal pronouncements.

5898011,4,B00E9FIFVS,"This movie gets quite a bit of flak for not living up to the 1959 version of Ben Hur. To be honest, film making from that era was far more of an involved process back then and the barrier of entry was probably exponentially harder for every aspect, from writing, pacing, edit, and technical support. It's the same reason why certain, older masterpieces from celluloid have that depth of character which leaves a legacy.

If I were to criticize the biggest thing in the film, it's the fact that they actually showed Jesus' face and gave him dialogue. 1959 Ben Hur is sublime because of the way they portrayed Jesus and instead focused on how the other characters reacted to him. Compared to the wordless, revered  presence Jesus inspired in Charlton Heston, the messages  he says to Jack Huston's Ben Hur feel spoonfed in comparison. Beyond that, I don't think keeping Messala alive was a bad change. The way it changed the ending was the one thing that was, in my opinion, made it better than the 1959 classic. The other thing, although I didn't notice it right away, is the strangely anachronistic costumes used as other reviewers have noted. In fact, I wouldn't have noticed without you guys mentioning it and when I rewatched it I found I couldn't unsee it.

Considering Hollywood's general disdain for Christianity these days, I'm actually really glad this film was made. It's well paced, surprisingly well acted by the main male leads, and the few SFX employed were well done. If you're going to dislike this because it isn't like the ""classic"", then you've probably already made up your mind about remakes. It's very much worth a watch and has a genuinely moving message.",1522627200,,1677,4.752577319587629

He still didn't convert but at least he saw that this man had something worth teaching.

No explanation of why Drusus (the man that Judah held at knife point) would reveal to Judah what happened to his family.  Well, ok Drusus mentioned wanting payment, but his unkempt look wasn't explained.  I almost thought they might throw in a plot of how he was secretly part of an underground protector of persecuted Jews and had left the Roman army because of it.

Kept my attention through the entire thing and there were many messages in this movie if one would look at what was going on.  Loved the ending and I won't spoil it but it was a twist.  To those who say this isn't good I am supposing they were not open minded about the ending.  Everything done in this was total class and talent and I don't have one complaint about it.  EXCELLENT!

But I did and was pleased that they didn't aspire to the grandiose as did the classic. It was practically naturalistic in intent. It tended to draw the viewer into it rather constantly coming out at its audience. I also liked how they gave more nods throughout regarding the Christ story than did the Heston treatment which gave support to character development of its protagonist. I have to admit that when Morgan Freeman came on the screen I had to roll my eyeballs.

5898085,3,B00E9FIFVS,"There were substantial deviations from the plot of the story compared to the original ""Ben-Hur"" starring Charlton Heston. Messala did not survive his injuries from the chariot race and died hating Judah Ben-Hur. In the remake, he survives and there is reconciliation among the Hur family with Massala. In the remake, the crime with which the Hur family was accused was an assassination attempt on the Roman procession through Jerusalem, which Judah ""confessed"" to in an attempt to save his sister and mother. Judah treated and sheltered a young zealot who fired the arrow at the Romans. In the original movie, a large piece of pottery accidentally fell from the rooftop balcony of the Hur house, and was seen as an attempt  on the prefect's life in the procession on the street below. The scenes of Judah's interaction with Jesus during his lifetime were well scripted. Some of the dialogue early in the movie, particularly between Tirzah (Judah's sister) and her mother were ""modernized"" with Tirzah speaking disrespectfully to her mother and not in keeping with the Jewish custom of respecting parents, and also, being in the presence of young men alone and unchaperoned was strictly forbidden. In the original movie, when Judah was shipwrecked, he saved a Roman officer from drowning which promoted him from slave/prisoner to the officer's servant. The African's role as Judah's benefactor was a change in the remake's plot. It was well acted, but there are many differences between the original movie and the remake,",1513036800,,1520,5.08

5898103,4,B00E9FIFVS,"There are plenty of movies made by Hollywood that manipulate viewers into all sorts of political views, social acceptance, and use CGI to generate adrenaline. I found this movie emotionally gratifying in that - regardless of it being a remake - it touches on something much of Hollywood believes an audience can't grasp; an ability to be moved by the simplicity of something like two brothers who come to odds. Is this film as grand as the original? Maybe not to film purists. In actuality, I found the original over-acted and dull with little of the heart this film showed. Are there historical errors? Yes, but they are not errors placed within the script to convince the viewer they can't possibly know any better. Rather, they were cinematographically erroneous and did not affect the storyline. I would much rather have my children watch this film and be able to take several messages away from it than 80 percent of the trash that is out for viewing these days. It was entertaining, full of action and drama. Above all, the characters were believable and so were the emotions of most of the lead characters.

As much as I like Morgan Freeman he really didn't fit into the world they created, nor did Pontius Pilate.

5898208,3,B00E9FIFVS,"After reading an number of reviews I realized my biggest beef with other viewers is how frequently they refer to the ""original"" film, by which I assume they mean the 1959 film starring Charlton Heston. While that film is a classic, and for good reason, it is not the only film before this one, and there may be future versions to follow. I love the 1959 version. It's so well done that when I watched in while in high school in the 90s, I thought it was amazing, even though it was outdated. All of this to say that I knew I would need to view the 2016 version with a different lens, knowing that it would be too short to feel like an epic tale. Because I did so, I was able to enjoy it for what it is. The movie has some historical flaws and some extreme deviations from the novel, but it was intended to be a re-imagining of the story, and as such, was entertaining to watch. No, it did not have me on the edge of my seat the way Charlton Heston's chariot race did, but it was still exciting. No, it did not have the full character development a longer film would allow. But in the end, I was glad I gave it a chance. It is a movie marketed to those who will not or cannot sit through a three hour movie that is so old it has an intermission. It retained the faith element while re-creating it a bit, allowing for reconciliation instead of revenge. I would give it four stars if they'd made it just a little longer to fill in some of the gaps in the story line (and if that time was used well).",1507334400,,1496,4.074576271186441

I mean the writing is not as good as the Godfather either...but it is really excellent in a number of moments.  Some excellent directing too...and editing...cinematography...and....every aspect of moviemaking is good here and there...and then pretty bad here and there.  It's all bandaged together by a great idea, solid storytelling, and mostly decent acting.  Bad set design, really bad costumes, uneven budget, even worse editing and directing at moments make it almost crash like a chariot hitting a rock....but to me the good outduels the bad just enough to stay upright.  I may be biased in that i think it also portrays the subversive power of Christ's relational theology in a way few movies have before...all with out making it the main focus of the film..or being too heavy handed.  If the movie ever does crash it may be in the last few minutes...but by then it did enough good things to put me in a forgiving mood. This movie tried to be great...and at times really was.

5898230,4,B00E9FIFVS,"Honestly, I was surprised that I liked this.  I love the old Ben Hur movie and it's very hard not to compare to an iconic film with Charlton Heston as the lead as well as the rest of the cast.  However, if you can look at this movie as a stand alone and not a remake, it's pretty good.  It was very exciting to watch and moved quickly, so I would definitely categorize it more as an action movie rather than a relational movie, though it does have it's moments.  It has a strong male cast which carry the movie.  The female cast was  a bit weak, I thought.

The religious aspect was watered down and pretty flaky.  Jesus was portrayed as a good man rather than God in flesh and moral rather than miraculous.  While some of His lines were quotes, some were completely fictional.  I'm sure this was to make this movie more palatable to the general public, but I found it detracted from the impact that Jesus made on Ben Hur in the book and movie.

Overall, a really good film.  It was visually stunning, exciting, the sets were good as well as the costumes.  Worth a couple of hours of your time.  Made me want to read the book again.",1506816000,,1132,4.228971962616822

(also, I can't compare the two since I haven't watched the 1959 version in forever. But that's always going to be the classic and best version to me). I think they did a great job with this version--- all the acting was great and it was a good movie in its own right. The actor who played Jesus really did an excellent job with his role. The final scenes with the crucifixion were done well enough for what was needed for the story.  and the chariot race! -----thank God for ""effects""  I kept saying ""those poor horses!""------- and even though I knew how it would turn out, it kept me on the edge of my seat - something I wasn't expecting, and was pleasantly surprised by.

MINOR SPOILERS(reason for removal of one star):

The idea of Judah, blaming completely his adopted brother Messala for the events that trigger the demise of his family was not something I could relate to completely . The movie depicts Messala as a merciless Roman commander towards his adoptive family, while essentially ignoring his perspective and reasoning. I personally saw a man who was trying to protect the community he grew with while staying true to his nation. This
is demonstrated  after capturing settlements without killing all the men, attempting to convince his superior officer that killing anybody was unnecessary, begging his brother (who is a prince) to help him prevent death and even trying to give excuse as to the killings of roman soldiers in the graveyard(Paraphrasing:This is holy ground to the Jews, shouldn't had tried to build here). Therefore, when the zealot Judah helped, attempts to kill a Roman general/Governor Messala is left with no choice. First, not only was Judah housing the rebel his brother had asked his help against but he let him escape after the same man doomed his family completely. So Messala, who sought his brother's help to avoid bloodshed, not only believes his brother is a zealot but also personally feels betrayed after being assured there was nothing to worry about. Messala's only downfall was his complete obedience to execute his foster family AFTER he believes they are zealots. Forced to a unwilling and brutal decision in which he has all rights to blame Judah for.",1506816000,4,1743,5.024221453287197

The movie begins with the hero throwing himself off his horse when his friend falls off his horse in a race. I don't see a sensible rider doing that. It immediately meant he had to carry the other fellow all the way back home, since he lost his horse. So double stupid. And in the first place, he could have seriously injured himself. Historically, riders frequently have injuries from falls. I expect more nobility died from horse incidents than battle.
But some work was put into the movie, so it gets three stars. I just get tired of contrived scenes, as if the director just doesn't know enough about anything to fit the plot to events.

And that is if the original wasn't done right in the first place.
With that sage observation in mind and the fact that Ben-Hur has been done (albeit remade as a talky after having been made as a B&W silent a fair excuse to redo it I'm sure JH would not take issue with), is a classic and still holds up as well as it did when it had its first run nearly sixty ago.

Sadly, apparently no other character development was needed. The female characters were mostly eye candy, as this version had little heart for their development. I was just glad it was over.
One other thing about these ""Biblically"" based movies the producers should note. Do you need to have a pop singer for every end credit or can't you afford a real composer?

I usually don't watch Christian movies because they usually butcher the stories but this was done fairly tastefully and there probably wasn't 10-15 minutes in total of the main story line characters encountering Jesus.

The changes kept it interesting and gave it fair and interesting twists to the original story. Yes, the dialog was a little campy now and then, but the entirety was well done, emotional, passionate. The ending was unforeseen and creative, the love stories fulfilling. The original has unforgettable moments, and nobody can be Judah like Charleton Heston.

The movie has nothing about His teachings or His miracles until the cross.  It did fairly accurately portray the crucifixion scene, words and deeds.  The big race was corny.  Horses drag one contestant around the arena making corners and running as fast as ever with his full weight pulling back on the reins the entire time and going from one side to the other.

Judah Ben-Hur was a Jewish prince who lives in Jerusalem with his adopted Roman brother, Masala.  The two were best of friends as kids, but one day Masala feels he's nothing compared to Judah and is never going to be a Ben-Hur, so in trying to gain his own reputation, he joins the Roman army believing he can make a name for himself.  In doing so, he puts his family in danger, partly because Judah refuses to give up names of his people who want to use violence to retaliate against the Roman occupation and Masala wanting to prove he is a true Roman aggressor.  Soon, the family falls apart and Judah is made to suffer for many years, but managed to stay alive no matter what hardship he faced.  Judah is then given a chance to face Masala in a chariot race in which winning does not cause retaliation, but a sport of who is the best and it wins the respect of the people. This story takes place at a time when Jesus was spreading his gospel of love and care, and not of hate and violence.

5898326,1,B00E9FIFVS,"Pretty boring movie, nothing like the 1959 version.  Lots of changes in the nature of the conflict between the central characters from the '59 version contributes to this.  Contributes to the lack of tension.  Pretty much dampens the theme of vengeance and forgiveness. Scriptural inaccuracies as well.  Poor soundtrack also contributed to the slow pace. A 2 hour movie seems longer than the 3.5 hour one from '59. Only high part is the chariot race, and even that does not compare. Why watch an imaginary CGI creation when you can see a real chariot race in the '59 version. Overall, a big fail.

I've read Lew Wallace's original book and seen both the silent movie version and the big-budget Charlton Heston version when I was a young teenager. This move really pales by comparison to all of these previous versions. It strays wildly from the book and the fairly honest movie remakes. Even the CGI is weak, which is the only reason I watched it. In fact, I basically fast-forwarded through much of it. Unfortunately, it plays to the modern audience with its trite relationships and over-explained plot lines, literally spelled out by constant blatheringeven in the chariot race, during which the charioteers literally bait each other through speed-induced conversations. It almost seems like a first-century version of road rage. I can't even image having wasted money on this fake version of an otherwise very fine book, and likewise fine earlier movie versions.

5898341,3,B00E9FIFVS,"I read the book so long ago that I cant compare the movie to that; however, the 1953 Heston version is a classic that is still fresh in my mind. I think its fairer to start out with a clean slate, but maybe Im making allowances because I just adore Jack Huston. Santoro is miscast as Jesus  I nearly laughed out loud when he told Ben Hur to love your enemies. It came out way too sexy! Anyone who has played a character named Paulo should not play Jesus  just wrong! I was pleased to see A. Zurer  I recognized her by her unique nostrils. At 25 minutes in, though, I can see why it got bad reviews  the dialogue stinks. I found myself wandering off to multitask. The matte paintings and green screen shots are just horrible and don't blend in with the sets. I couldn't put my finger on what exactly was missing until I heard the blaring horns  theres a complete lack of an effective score. To me, the score is one of the most important glues that holds together a production. Overall, the quality of the sound editing is very poor. I had to keep readjusting my volume. I rarely have my speakers set to more than 15, but I had to crank them up to 45 just to hear the muffled dialogue. I got over that once I heard the camels belching and set eyes on the glorious white horses staring directly into the camera. Now, thats acting! Id nearly given up until the ramming scene revealed that this script was taking a different turn than the Heston classic. I was curious to see how the writers would finish the story and Im glad that I did. It picked up considerably after the 1 hour mark and finished with a VASTLY more intense chariot race scene. This Ben Hur has a LOT more very graphic violence - dangling bodies during the ramming scene; several chariot dragging scenes; multiple scenes with horses getting injured or killed. It was almost too much for me. Unlike the classic version, this production actually has closure, although the end credits song is totally out of place. Overall, I give the acting B, the script C, the special effects C, the music D, which equals out to a solid C movie.",1505347200,3,2092,4.3538461538461535

I was surprised that the original release ratings were so bad and that convinced me to wait until it was released on video.  I was very thankful to see it was recently made available as part of our Amazon Prime subscription.

It took a bit of convincing to get my Wife to watch it as she is a big fan of Chuck Heston but she finally relented and we watched it last evening. In the end, she too thought it was a good film but said that everyone who watches this version should also go find and watch the 1959 version. Each has it's own greatness to it.

The visual effects of this new version are amazing to say the least but 1959 version had special effects that amazing for the technology available at the time.

5898355,4,B00E9FIFVS,"Decent and enjoyable but don't compare it to the original.  It is a good film in its own right but trying to whittle down a 4 hour classic into a 2 hour movie means that some of the back story and interaction that made the 1959 film a true epic is missing in this film.  This is not an epic like the old movies from the 1950s.  But that doesn't take away from the updated film.  Modern CGI effects make the movie more 'realistic' and the interaction between Ben Hur and Messala are explored well as are the concepts of redemption and forgiveness.  It probably isn't completely realistic, without giving away the ending (it is moderately different from the 1959 film) it is unlikely that this kind of forgiveness would occur after all the injury and pain but it was a nice attempt at a 'feel good ending' for a film.

It is a quick paced action type film that probably tries to do more than is possible in 2 hours but it is enjoyable and watchable.  Just don't expect anything epic..",1505174400,2,982,4.362637362637362

5898364,2,B00E9FIFVS,"Terrible mess of a movie.  The original, starring Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd, was so much better.  I could understand changing small parts of the original story line to bring a fresh look at the relationship between Ben Hur and Messala.  In the original, Ben Hur was the protagonist and Messala was the antagonist.  I found the changes in this new version had me rooting for Messala during the first hour before I shut it down and gave up watching.

**Spoiler alert**  One change to the original had a zealot attempt to kill Pontius Pilate while he lead his legions into Jerusalem.  This zealot was hiding in Ben Hur's house to heal from a wound received during an earlier skirmish with Romans soldiers.  So how does he repay Ben Hur?  He attempts to kill Pontius Pilate with a bow and arrow from the roof top of Ben Hur's home.  Before the zealot flees, he drops the bow in open space  giving you the impression he is leaving the evidence behind for Ben Hur and his family to take the blame. Of course, the Romans know the attempt came from Ben Hur's house.  Would you protect this jerk knowing your family will bear the brunt of Roman brutal justice?  Well, in this version Ben Hur puts himself and his family in danger with his unbelievable actions.  I thought, 'come on, that was such a stupid plot line'.  There were other plot line changes at the beginning of the movie that also had me slowly rooting for Messala and not for Ben Hur.  Did not expect to feel this way.

In the original Ben Hur was a man of principle.  In the newer version, Ben Hur came off simply as an elitist.  The phony British accent or whatever it was didn't help any.  Frustrated with the story line I decided to shut it down at the one hour mark.  My two star review is being generous.  This movie was just a total bummer.",1505001600,,1809,4.401812688821752

5898445,2,B00E9FIFVS,"Being a critic of the Jewish Zealots, I knew the tragic story of Judah Ben-Hur (Jack Huston), a Jewish prince falsely accused of the attempted murder of Pontius Pilate, was going to be a bone of contention with me as I watched this movie. On the one hand, the Romans, for better or worse, ruled that part of the world; on the other, there's the inevitable clash between Judah and his adopted brother Messala (Toby Kebbell), a distinguished Roman officer who's forced into choosing loyalties between state and friendship. My primary gripe with this adaptation is it needn't have happened (except as a device to push the plot in the desired direction). Why would Judah have sacrificed himself and his family to save a Zealot youth who betrayed the hospitality of Judah's family. The logical thing would have been to name the culprit and some of the Zealot leaders, but Judah chooses his loyalty to a kid we barely know and whom Judah barely knows!

The script also is lacking and the lines are delivered in a lackadaisical manner that makes the movie difficult to follow. Acting also is distressingly unconvincing, most likely because of the script. I found myself angry at Judah for selling his family down the tubes and subjecting them to Roman brutality simply to protect the one person in the movie who deserved to die and who probably ended up dying years later on Masada! To ask one's family to pay the price was unconscionable.

The battle at sea was not well done and there were no adrenaline-pumping scenes. And though one would expect the chariot racing scenes to be exciting, they don't begin to compare with Charton Heston's epic scenes. In fact, one wonders why this movie was even necessary.

It is worth watching but I'll only watch it once. The chariot race is good. It is silly that Morgan Freeman is yelling racing instructions to Ben-Hur during the race.

There were some pieces of the story line that did not flow smoothly from one portion of the story to the next but all in all, this was not a bad movie.

If you are expecting to see a remake of the Charlton Heston version then straight off you will be highly disappointed.
This is ""Ben Hur....Lite"", but LONG, ...VERY long!

The characters are all so PC ""nice"", .....you know, good-looking WHITE blue-eyed sensitive new-age guy Jesus and yes, if you were wondering,  Morgan Freeman turns up AGAIN to play yet another god-like role, all kitted out with the most idiotic set of dreadlocks ever.
He's literally wearing an old grey dead octopus tied to his head!
Hmmm...I was wondering what they did with all those ""fishy"" prosthetics left over from Pirates of the Caribbean Dead Man's Chest!

Of course this time the CG works overtime, but only serves to demonstrate just how much more effective movie making was back when you had to do just about everything ""for real"", with maybe only a bit of back projection now and then.
The OLD version beats this on every level.
This version is chock-full of historical inaccuracies of costume and setting and has inappropriate ""modern"" dialogue inserted every now and then to make it sound hip. At times Ben looks as though he's in Medieval England, or has just stepped off Rodeo Drive!

The script is god-damned awful,...crack-up lines abounding.
Wait for Ben's Mother and Sister residing in a very grim leper colony who are suddenly ""cured"" of their small disfigurements by a rain shower, ...which just happens to coincide with Jesus dying ever so prettily on the cross.
""We have been cleansed.""  she says, with all the emotion of announcing  her nails need cutting!

This movie was obviously made with the single express purpose of re-doing that famous chariot race, so that's what you get after a VERY drawn out prelude, but again made with so much very poorly done CGI, that once more you will be left with nothing but appreciation for just how good the old movie was.
Actually the chariot race sequence reminded me very much of that pod-racing bit in Star Wars..The Phantom Menace...and was just about as believable.

And did I mention this thing is..... L....O....N....G?
It took me three separate goes to get right through the piece, and each time with greater reluctance to sit down to yet another try.
Then, a ""feel-good"" ending did nothing to alleviate my tedium, or time invested I can tell you!
Everybody ends up friends with everybody else and then they all just ride off into the desert like some old Tom Mix western.
Everybody that is except poor old JC.....but we see no more of him after his head lolls forward and he ""gives up the ghost"".
Actually, he wasn't the only one thinking about giving up at that stage too!

Regrettably I bought the thing but there's no reason you should waste good money too.
If you get the chance to see it for nothing, just realise you are probably being overcharged, ...unless you can keep your finger firmly on the Fast Forward button. There are a lot of very dull bits.",1497225600,,2986,4.7471042471042475

5898502,3,B00E9FIFVS,"First of all, the visuals are splendid. The look of the film and the art direction is just gorgeous. That's it for what I loved about this film.

Now, at the end of the film, as I watched the credits roll, I thought that, more than anything, it was a mash up of the 1956 film and an episode of FRIENDS (the one about Joey's chariot ride). The characters, their sensibilities, their inner lives, everything is 21st-century, urban, young adult. I can't go into this anymore without writing a spoiler, so I will leave that there.

Even so, I could've gone along with the story, until the ending. It reminds me of those 18th-century theater companies that rewrote the endings of Shakespeare's tragedies so they were not so sad.  Juliet wakes up to find Romeo and Emelia tells Othello about the handkerchief business before he kills Desdemona, and everybody lives happily ever after. The ending was about that dumb.

I think they should've just made this movie and call it something else, but not Ben Hur.  I actually read the book, when I was a youngster, I remember it vividly, and remember a lot of details that made it hard to watch this movie. Like how Judah learned to drive a chariot, really? I kept waiting for ""wax on, wax off.""

I really did miss the part about the three wise men. And the Roman who adopts Judah. Okay, it's a melodrama, I admit it, but it's a terrific melodrama. This movie just got it wrong.",1493596800,9,1415,4.5078125

5898507,2,B00E9FIFVS,"Soooooo bad. I really wanted to like it and decided not to compare it to the original so I could enjoy the story on it's own. But it was just so flimsy. They based everything on the CGI chariot race and slapped the rest of it together. Jesus was weakly portrayed and dull. Morgan Freeman's character was terrible. And what was with Judah Ben-Hur wearing pants? So wrong for that era! In the chariot race he got dragged around the arena a couple of laps and 1) didn't turn into raw hamburger meat, 2) pulled himself back up using nothing but reins (seriously?!!) and 3) didn't have a scratch on him.

5898540,2,B00E9FIFVS,"Lot of reviewers compering this to the earlier William Wyler (1959) and Cecille B. DeMille (1925) versions.  In my opinion, thats mistargeted.  True, its not as good as either of those, but where it really falls short is in departing so far from the Lew Wallace novel that inspired it.

Worse, it follows the usual pattern we have come to expect from Hollywood  not the recorded Jesus, but the imaginary Jesus, reinvented for these modern times.  A selective Jesus, who preached only love and tolerance and inclusiveness and nonviolence.  The Hollywood version is the thoroughly nonjudgmental Jesus.  The almost convictionless whatever Jesus.  Not the recorded Jesus who railed about sin, guilt of sin, repentance from sin, embracement of faith, and holy living.

The recorded Jesus actually did preach these things  and he preached them far more regularly than what is included in the highly selective Hollywood version of his message.  But because these are perceived as negative things that can make people feel bad or guilty, they almost always get redacted out of any Hollywood portrayal of Jesus.

Apart from that, the main storyline itself  the personal dramatic conflict between the antagonist Messala Serverus and protagonist Judah Ben-Hur -- simply failed due to a combination of poor writing, poor directing, poor acting, and poor film editing.  The climax of the movie is the chariot race.  In the 1925 DeMille and 1959 Wyler versions of this film, we see pretty much the entire event and know whats happening most of the time.

But these days Hollywood has fallen in love with trendy techniques like shaky cam, overly quick scene cuts, and unrealistically accelerated action (much more rapid than occurs in real life) -- all of which leaves us wondering much of the time as to what is happening.  We're reduced to guessing.  It obscures the story more than it tells the story.

If you want a disconnected adrenaline rush, abstracted from any meaningful activity that might deliver it, this is your movie.  Its not nearly as satisfying as a good round of sporting activity or a meaningful moment of connection with those you love, but it definitely will make your heart beat a little faster.  But its like finding a counterfeit twenty-dollar bill.  The immediate gratification fades quickly when you realize its not the genuine article.",1489968000,2,2348,5.044155844155844

5898544,2,B00E9FIFVS,"Saw this movie two days ago as a rental, and I have to say it was really all over the place in terms of story telling and theme; sometimes it seems like it wants to be a movie about revenge, other times its a movie about family and loyalty, and weirdly enough there are scenes with Jesus that make me think it's trying to be a philosophical/religious movie.

These weird tonal shifts will throw you off when they happen, and leave you confused and unsatisfied; as the movie seems to want to tell several different stories at once but just doesn't commit enough to each narrative to make it happen.

The main character seems at first to be motivated entirely by pacifism at the beginning (to the point where he lets something horrible happen to his family because he doesn't want to turn in someone who might be killed for what they did); then for the rest of the movie he seemed dedicated to revenge, only for him to do a full reversal and go back to being a pacifist. It doesn't really add up, it's like this movie is trying to be the Count of Monte Cristo or something, but just cant motivate us to identify enough with it's characters to make it work.

Also the main character talks in a really guttural and low voice, which makes it hard to understand what he says sometimes and ruins a lot of the dialogue.

I'd say give this movie a pass, unless your looking for something ""funny bad"" in which case watch it with a group of people, not alone.",1489881600,,1448,4.351851851851852

5898551,1,B00E9FIFVS,"This is the STUPIDEST pile of horse manure of a movie I've seen in quite a long time. The plot was totally laughable from beginning to end:

1. The idea that a Jewish family would take in a Roman orphan in approximately 20 A.D. is LUDICROUS.
2. The first appearance of Jesus in the film is more or less in the year 28 A.D. Jesus was not working in Jerusalem as a carpenter in 28 A.D. And he would not have been alone, he would have been working with his family. And his ministry did not even start until 30 A.D., so how would he have been preaching to passerby in a market?
3. What was the actual crime Ben-Hur was accused of? I couldn't figure it out for the life of me.
4. Man becomes slave on ship + ship is later destroyed in an unknown war + slave then happens to float to the shore of his homeland = ridiculous storytelling.
5. Ben-Hur states to Esther it's dangerous for him to be back in Jerusalem -- but he thinks absolutely nothing of going back to his old house to search for a sword.
6. THE HOUSE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN LEFT LIKE A SHRINE. Some other family or the Romans would have been using it by then. THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO SWORD for him to swipe.
7. Pontus Pilate NEVER said he thought Jesus of Nazareth was a threat. He didn't care one way or the other -- it was the Jewish High Priests that had it out for who they deemed a heretic.
8. There was not a Roman sports arena in Jerusalem. Israel was considered ""the armpit"" of that part of the Roman Empire. It was not turning into a new capital with things like chariot races happening.
9. Ben-Hur tells Esther it's not safe for him to be back in the city (need to repeat it) -- so don't tell anyone he's there -- SO THEN WHY ARE THERE HUNDREDS OF JEWS AT THE CHARIOT RACE CHANTING HIS NAME?!?!?! AND WHY IN THE HELL WOULD ZEALOTS SET FOOT INSIDE A ROMAN CIRCUS?!?!?!
10. I have to say it again: THERE WERE NO CHARIOT RACES HAPPENING IN JERUSALEM ON THE DAY OF JESUS' DEATH.
11. And why in the world would Ben-Hur be sad at the execution of a Messiah that he saw for all of two seconds?!
12. NO ONE stopped to offer Jesus water while he was carrying the cross down the city streets.
13. There was NOT a huge crowd at the Crucifixion. Most of Jesus' followers had fled in fear for their own lives.
14. There was NOT a woman named Esther among the Disciples. Inventing a character and inserting them in the middle of pivotal historical events for the sake of attempting dramatic effect is a crime against artistic integrity.
15. The idea that the estranged brothers would reconcile within 2 minutes after years and years of hating and trying to kill each other is JUST PLAIN BRAINDEAD.
16. And what the crap was a pop song from the 21st century doing in the credits of a movie set in the era of the New Testament?!?!?!

5898553,5,B00E9FIFVS,"Set during the time of Christ in a Roman-occupied Jerusalem, Ben-Hur is the story of two brothers, Judah Ben-Hur (Jack Huston), son of a wealthy Jewish family, and his brother Messala (Toby Kebbel), a Roman by birth who was adopted into the Ben-Hur family at a young age.  In a time of Jewish uprising against the Romans, circumstances and fate pull the brothers apart, with Messala becoming a celebrated officer in the Roman military and Judah winding up a slave on a Roman galley ship.  Through a series of events spanning several years, Judah eventually rises high enough to try and win his freedom in one of Rome's ferocious and bloody chariot races, a race which is heavily favored to be won by his former brother.

Ben-Hur works great as both historical drama and large-scale action movie, and manages the task of being inspiring without seeming preachy.  Set against the backdrop of Christ's time on Earth, Jesus (Rodrigo Santoro) appears in only a few scenes, but obviously crucial ones.  It's actually one of the best film portrayals of Jesus, keeping in line with a general high standard for acting on the part of the whole cast.  This is a difficult movie to review without giving away too many spoilers, since so many of the scenes the film is built around, such as the chariot race, occur toward the end.  So I'll just end off by now by saying that this is a must-see for anybody into the grand historical epics, and one of my favorite movies of 2016.",1489017600,,1464,4.651162790697675

Charleton Heston as Juda Ben Hur!  Clean cut, a little hammy on the acting, but makes you believe his actions.  This current offering shows Juda s an unshaven (to begin with), unwashed mr. good guy who wants to get even with his old friend.  So they race chariots to see who can kill the other.  And that ENDING!  Ben Hur's friend who he tried to kill in the chariot race, and who WAS dragged around the track at high speed and then THROWN over the crashing chariot and horses, is, after apparently a short time, recovered fully and then happily races Benny down a trail.  Wow!

5898611,4,B00E9FIFVS,"Ben-Hur, 2016 film

This is set in the time of the Messiah, 33 AD. The Roman Empire covered thousands of miles. It shows two young men riding horses. Judah Ben-Hur has an adopted brothre, Messala, a Roman. One is thrown from a horse and is hurt. They show their family life. Messala will return to Rome to fight the rebels in Germania. Years pass. They talk, and a carpenter comments on proper behavior. How should people behave in a cruel world? They talk about the Zealots who protest Roman rule. Later Judah Ben-Hur is taken in by the Roman soldiers. Messala has returned. He tells about the wars in Persia and elsewhere. Messala asks Judah to use his influence with his people. The Zealots attacked Roman soldiers. Messala and a soldier visit the Ben-Hur palace. Messala asks Judah to name Romes enemies; he wont. Roman soldiers march into Jerusalem.

An archer shoots an arrow at the Roman ruler! The Romans break into the palace and take prisoners. Who shot the arrow? Judah confesses to save his family. Take them all is the order. Messala says Judahs actions condemned his family. Judah is led away to his punishment. A man offers him a drink of water. Judah is sent to the galleys. The galley slaves are given their orders. There is a battle, flaming arrows strike below deck. Their galley is rammed, water pours in, the slaves fall into the water. Judah breaks free and survives. The Roman fleet was sunk, Caesar demands a retaliation against the Greeks. Judah reaches land. He finds fresh water and food. He is questioned about his past. Judah promises to cure a sick horse and asks for help. Men attack one man, another speaks against this. Is he a danger? Chariot horses run away, Judah halts them, then explains why.

The Romans use bread and circuses to entertain their people and keep them happy. Judah goes to Jerusalem and meets Esther. He asks about his mother and sister. Only Messala could know their fate. Messala speaks about local conditions. A gift is delivered to him; he know where to go and meets Judah. There is conflict between Judah and Messala. Esther warns him about hatred. The attack on Messala is punished by reprisals against twenty Jews. Know the world you live in says a man. He suggests beating Messala in the circus as revenge. There is a wager against Messala in a chariot race. If the Jew wins all charges against him will be forgiven. The African tells Judah about the tricks used in the races, and tells him to stay back at first.

A captured thief tells Judah his family is alive in the caves. Judah is taken to them; they are lepers! The day of the race arrives. The teams race around the course. Some drivers fall from their chariot when they are upset! [Demolition Derby?] One man is dragged but regains his seat. Then Messala makes a misstep! Judah is the winner. Charioteer and horses are expendable. There is a future for a winning charioteer in Rome. Later Jesus is taken by the Romans, condemned, and led to his execution. The crowd mocks the criminals on the cross. The sky darkens, rain falls. Later Judah meets the crippled Messala and offers help. Judahs family is released. Messala and Judah are reconciled.

I never read the book so I cant comment on this version. It does not seem to have been commercially successful. You can compare it to the 1959 version which ran on for much longer because of its padding. General Lew Wallace was Governor of the New Mexico Territory in the 1880s. He offered a pardon to William Bonney if he surrendered; this promise was not honored. You know the rest of that story.",1486857600,,3566,4.627172195892575

He later gets his revenge on them by winning the chariot race and even makes up with Messala once he gets religion. Sorry, but all this seemed rather unbelievable and trite to me due to the limited acting abilities of the cast. Morgan Freeman was the best actor in it.

The zealots were a  murdering sect that killed and terrorized the people of  Jerusalem  so completely and were so unstoppable that the people of Jerusalem asked the Romans to help them with the problem. The Romans did show up and tried everything they could think of to stop the zealots but nothing worked. In time, after having lost many of their own soldiers ,the Romans, made the decision that only complete destruction would work and proceeded to do so. I only watched about half an hour and it was awful. I am disgusted with fractured history that Hollywood pours out. Aside from that I thought the lines were boring and the acting really second rate.

5898667,2,B00E9FIFVS,"This unnecessary remake seems to be targeted at the audience that searches for faith-based movies.  I say that because Jesus (Rodrigo Santoro) keeps popping up from time to time.  Set in Jerusalem at the time of Christ, two men who have grown up together set off in different directions, only to be reunited in a grueling chariot race.

Messala Severus (Toby Kebbell) is not Jewish but is adopted by the family of Hur, noble Judeans.  His adoptive brother, Judah (Jack Huston) is close in age and both love competition.  Messala, realizing that he will never be truly accepted into society as an outsider, decides to head to Africa to see whats what.  It turns out he becomes a soldier for the Roman Empire.  Hes quickly promoted to officer rank and heads the plans for the Emperors representative, Pontius Pilate, to go to Jerusalem.  He meets early with Judah and urges him to keep the locals compliant.  The Romans are brutal and unforgiving.  And there is a rebellion afoot.  The Romans have no regard for what they call Zealots and have no compunction about killing able bodied males to keep their conquest under foot.

When an assassination attempt from atop the Hur home fails, Judah and his family are blamed for harboring a killer.  Judah is sent to the slave galleys of Roman warships.  He manages to escape when the ship sinks in a battle.  Washed up onto the beach he is rescued by Ilderim, a wealthy African gambler played by a dreadlocked Morgan Freeman, doing his best to stifle laughter when he recites his dumb lines.

This clunker of a film is directed by Timur Bekmambetov and looks like it should have either been a TV movie or straight to DVD.  The dialog is ridiculous.  I was expecting some of the characters to start high-fiving each other.  The moment we wait for is the chariot race of course and it does have its moments, but is also loaded with plenty of CGI effects.  When Judah gets temporarily knocked off his chariot and thrown through the air, somehow he manages to hold onto the reins and gets dragged for a couple laps before climbing back on board.  When it was all over, I was mostly worried about the horses.  While the film isn't a total waste of time, it isn't very good either.  My advice is to stick with the original 1959 version.",1486080000,,2273,4.599502487562189

5898677,3,B00E9FIFVS,"Watered down version of Ben Hur. If you want to watch the real version, watch the 1959 version. Messalah dies in the 1959 version. He is symbolic of the person that succumbs to hate/competition/pride, lives his life by it, and never breaks from it even in death. This symbolism also depicts the path of destruction that is carved through hate/competition/pride. Judah is the opposite, in that he symbolizes perseverance and eventually turns from the cycle of hate (breaks the cycle). Not surprising this modern version of the movie has the campy, happy, feel-good ending. Typical of modern watered down Christianity. Life as a Christian most often does not have happy endings. It is through trials and suffering that a Christian's faith grows and their character is refined. Also, the cheesy statement by Jesus in this film that states mankind's natural state is love. Not only does this misrepresent Jesus' character, it misrepresents a main theme of the Bible... man's natural state is evil/sin. It's after coming to Christ that man turns from and fights his natural state (and continues to do so).",1485907200,6,1100,5.049450549450549

5898681,5,B00E9FIFVS,very very good movie!,1485907200,,21,4.5
5898682,4,B00E9FIFVS,"I am a bit fan of the original Ben-Hur, I own the anniversary gift box! So when I heard that Ben-Hur was being re-imagined, I was like most people - very skeptical. I don't like to pre-judge movies without watching them, so I went into this movie with very how expectations and just try to see the movie as something new and fresh. This is a very worthy re-imagining of Ben-Hur!

Here are my comparisons:

- The sets were incredible as well as the feeling that you are actually seeing first century Jerusalem.
- The famous chariot race is well done, but in all honesty the chariot race in the 1959 Ben-Hur is still breathtaking today as when it was first shown.
- Jesus, yes he plays a part in both of these versions, more so in this new version.  But the quiet presence of Jesus in the original film is very moving, there's no need to have dialogue.  You absolutely understand what is going on and how this unfolds and effects the characters in the movie.  But I will say that in this new version, Jesus effects all characters and his main teachings directly reflect what the characters are going through as well as the final outcome.
- Relationship of Ben-Hur and Messala: there is no doubt that this new version shows us so much more about them as individuals and as true ""brothers"", this is the cornerstone of the movie, their love, devotion, loyalty to one another and how their fears over took their better qualities. It was very refreshing to see this on screen.
- Character of Messala, in the original film you have no pity or understanding for him - you see why that hatred between both Ben-Hur and Messala exists and festers.  In this version of the film, you see the confusion, the hurt that Messale feels.  You have a mixture of feelings for both the protagonist and the antagonist.
- Original film was about hate and revenge, a sentiment that all can relate to (especially under the circumstances of the film) but in this re-imagining it's more about redemption and forgiveness.  I like both takes on this, but there is something very profound in this new version with both main characters going through this journey.  The movie does a great job of conveying that there is only so much hate a person can have, that it will eat you up but in the end, does not grant you the peace that one longs for or is in need of.

In all honestly, I like both versions of Ben-Hur a lot, for some reason this story has always touched me and I do agree with others who say that the story of Ben-Hur will always be relevant and transcend time.",1485907200,,2539,4.440860215053763

5898708,5,B00E9FIFVS,"I was raised on the original Ben-Hur starring Charlton Heston more than 50 years ago; some people haven't seen what a masterpiece Cecile B. DeMille put on screen.  The movie won 11 academy awards with an all-star cast and brilliant script.  So what about the new movie?  First, don't compare the two movies as they are different stories in many ways.  Second, the cast members in the new movie do a brilliant job of drawing peoples heart and soul into the movie.  Finally, each movie should stand on its own merit.
I read the novel that was recently released from a descendant of the writer of Ben-Hur originally written by Lew Wallace; the new book is by Carol Wallace.  Each novel is unique in telling the story of Christ and His interactions with people.  The story focuses on how Christ as a man ultimately came to give His life for mankind.
In this newest version, the ending was really powerful and I couldn't help but be deeply moved by the scene between two brothers.  I was amazed at the chariot race scenes and thankful the studio didn't feel compelled to focus on the blood and gore.  The movie focused on the battle between a Roman and a Jew when Rome was oppressing the Jewish people and nation.
These movies, both the original and the newest Ben-Hur, are ones to add to a home library and watch as a family.  Talk about the Jewish people and how much God loves them and came to them and to us so we might someday be with Him in heaven.  Explain what isn't in the Bible and visit the Lew Wallace website about the museum and the grounds right here in Indiana.  I plan on taking a trip next year to see where Lew Wallace penned his tale of the Christ over a period of 10 years.  I believe there is one manuscript written in Wallaces own handwriting still in existence at a college library for people to see though I expect it might be moved to the Wallace home or perhaps shared with others in some way in the future.  For history lovers, ones who like adventure, battles and such, Ben-Hur rates very highly in both written and media form!

The main character is fictional can his tale is told around events we believe actually happened. its probably not 100% historically accurate where pilate is concerned.

I expected something WAY better in the re-showing of this wonderful story 57 years after the original.  And the photography?  Forget about that too!  Wobbly and shaky picture from a hand held camera?  What's up with that?  This is Ben-Hur, not some cheap ""shoot it quick and get it edited"" flick.  If you want to see the story of Ben-Hur, don't buy this 2016 version.  Buy the 1959.  There is NO comparison.  And that guy Jack Huston?  Well, let's just say he ain't no Charlton Heston.

5898823,1,B00E9FIFVS,"I recently finished reading the book for the first time this week, what I had wanted to do was read the book then watch all three versions on film. I have LOVED the Heston '59 version since I was a child and owned it on VHS, DVD and now the Blu Ray Box Set. Upon watching the 1925 version, again, after 15 years, and the '59 version again (I seem to watch it yearly, if not from my own copies, on TCM) I was excited to see the 2016 version. I like the cast and hoped for some great CGI. I was sorely disappointed, and that's being kind! This movie... I don't know what this movie is, it calls itself Ben-Hur, but IT IS NOT!!!!!! This is the LEAST like the book! From the start this film is wrong, amongst other things, there are peppers in a market scene, I have an anthropology degree, peppers came from the New World, so over a thousand years after the first century C.E.. I use this example because if they can't even get something like that right, something soooo simple, don't expect them to get anything right! Another thing, Ben-Hur KILLS Quintus Arrius! OK, He never does that in the book or the other two film versions. Messala and he are not actual brothers, they are best friends, closer than brothers. Lew Wallace, Ben-hur's author, was very specific, he did not want Jesus played by an actor in the stage play, because he felt it would be sacrilegious. The producers honored that request, by not casting the role, he was depicted as a beam of light. This tradition was continued in the '25 version, we only see his arms. And in the '59 version, it's the back of him or his hands, his face is never shown, and he never speaks, neither does he speak in the book, until the crucifixion, and then only the words from the Bible. But this film says to hell with tradition to hell with Ben-Hur's story! These are just some of the MAANNY inaccuracies in this movie! It is no wonder this film flopped. Had the producers and director (this is what you get when the director of Abraham Lincoln vampire hunter is in charge) made a truer adaptation of the source material, it probably would have done better, as the stage play, and other two film versions did in their time. They were HUGE! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY! DO NOT WATCH THIS GARBAGE!!!!",1484179200,5,2245,4.373205741626794

5898829,5,B00E9FIFVS,"I didn't expect to really like this version since the Charlton Heston movie is such a classic but I was pleasantly surprised. While the older movie, at almost four hours, takes longer to develop and goes more in depth in the story, this new version provides a faster paced modern retelling while still keeping the spirit of the story. The ending is slightly different which gave it a stronger Christian forgiveness theme and had a more feel good aspect to it. I never read the book so I can only compare the two movies, both of which I enjoyed.

Both movies also had a great chariot race with loads of brutal stunts but as you may expect, the newer movie looks even more deadly and found new ways to take out both horses and riders.

I will always recommend watching the classic but if you are time limited or just want a more modern looking movie, this version is a good substitute.",1484179200,13,883,4.444444444444445

5898866,5,B00E9FIFVS,Wonderful movie.  Especially if you love how they portrayed Jesus and the love He has for all of us.  The Chariot race and the horse scenes were exciting and pretty violent. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone too young to know that the people got up and went home after filming. I also had to keep telling myself that no horses were hurt in this film.  I suppose CGI has come a long way.,1484006400,,387,4.202702702702703

5898903,5,B00E9FIFVS,I actually prefer this version of Ben-Hur over the great DeMille version with Charleton Heston.  I haven't read the novel but the story seemed more complete with more Christ interactions and the scene at the Cross was heartbreaking.  Highly recommended.,1483920000,,253,5.3
5898904,4,B00E9FIFVS,"I didn't bother to see this in the theater because I love the original and didn't think this one could compete. Admittedly this one does a better job of being closer to the book than Heston's version from the 50s did and it helps that it's not a true remake as they weren't trying to redo Heston's version but adapt the book.

This movie took a lot of hits from critics because like me they assumed this was a remake of Heston but it's not. It's a beautiful movie that doesn't take anything away from the original and deserves its own place in the history of cinema. You really need to give it a chance.",1483920000,,603,4.243478260869566

5899000,1,B00E9FIFVS,"I'm fairly sure the scriptwriters of this movie didn't bother to read the Lew Wallace Classic, watch the 1959 classic the whole way through, or consult a history book because despite the great cast, beautiful sets and effects this movie lacked most of the elements of a nuanced novel and instead invented their own overly contrived and overly complicated plot with a watered-down message. What a waste of a great cast and a great story! I recommend the audible unabridged edition or numerous editions on Kindle or you can just watch the 1959 version which like any adaptation made edits - but it still managed to capture the heart of Lew Wallace's message about faith.",1483315200,24,668,4.817391304347826

Jesus shows up in 3 (or was it 4?) scenes in this version, with only a back shot in the 1959 version.  As a Christian I love that.  And who doesn't love Morgan Freeman?

5899021,3,B00E9FIFVS,"First off, I loved the Charlton Heston, 1959 version of this film. I loved everything about it, Heston, Boyd and the entire cast and story. I had such high hopes for this version of it, as I like jack Huston who portrays Judah Ben-Hur and love Toby Kobbell who portrays his ""brother""/nemesis. jack Huston seemed to have a problem with, whay I believe to be the necessary amount of passion for the role, toby was totally ""hiss-worthy"" as the bad fellow. it was a very pretty production, don't get me wrong but maybe I held onto the original just a bit too much, the religious overtones were well put forth and were beautifully portrayed. All in all, I say give it a try but don't look to Jack Huston to carry this movie as heston did. Just try to approach it as a new and different movie.",1483315200,9,787,4.360544217687075

5899103,5,B00E9FIFVS,"I enjoyed this movie so much that I saw it twice in the show.  Knowing the 1959 Charlton Heston version as well as I do, I decided to see this new film for itself, did not compare it to the 1959 version--it's a very different approach to the story.  The 1959 was all spectacle and documentary in aspects, whereas this was straight-forward story telling.  They highly accented what was most needed in the galley/sea battle and chariot race scenes, but the film itself is well filmed overall.

It did bring to mind the 1920s silent version with Ramon Navarro--which I found the chariot scene more gripping that the 1959 version.  It was fast paced and kept your eyes glued to the screen--same with the 2016.  It kept a very fast pace and was very gripping.

What else I enjoyed was showing more background in the friendship between Judah and Mesala, and you see how the change in Mesala comes to be and why.  This movie was more heart moving for me than the 1959 movie.

See it for itself and don't view it as a ""remake"".  It stands alone and should be viewed with that lens.",1482796800,,1073,4.428571428571429

Obviously the original is a far better cast and wrought story.
The cartoon version of Rome too is silly. Someday we will write this story without so many obviously white European faces. I don't say that because of something instilled into me in college or public schools it is rather just an observation that someday the actual faces of the period will hold as much attraction as those of the dominate group in the West and the deep strangeness of the story of Jesus and of Ben-Hur will be told with depth.

5899170,2,B00E9FIFVS,"I suspect most everyone old enough to have seen the original release of the 1959 version of this film would find this remake a very poor effort. I can understand that the younger set of today might find the earlier version a bit too long, a bit too melodramatic and a bit dated in style and tone. As an eight year old, I was taken to see the 1959 version at the Egyptian Theater in Hollywood and saw it in its original Camera 65/Ultra Panavision roadshow presentation. That version simply cannot be seen today - the manner in which it was meant to be seen. In spite of its age, the 1959 version remains a magnificent production, resting on a very good script (by Christopher Fry, Gore Vidal and several others) - a difficult thing to pull off for a Biblical epic. Stephen Boyd was a terrific Mesala, Hugh Griffith was a cunning, witty and humorous, Ilderim in an Oscar winning performance, and Heston, another Oscar winner, did well in carrying off the title role. The 1959 version had one of the greatest scores ever composed for a motion picture thanks to Miklos Rozsa - another Oscar winner. The chariot race is still considered one of the greatest action sequences ever filmed and was, of course, free of CGI and digital effects - in other words - it was real. The present film's race was exciting in some ways, true, but it was a preposterous sequence devoid of any sense of reality. The acting in this remake was, in my opinion, mediocre at best. The main actors just don't have the acting chops or the screen presence to carry it off. Even Morgan Freeman, one of our finest actors, can't help this production. I have never seen him less effective in any film. Even he can't overcome a lackluster script. Seemed like he was phoning it in. (To say nothing of his bizarre dreadlocks.) Unless I missed something, it looked as though Jesus had moved to Jerusalem and set up a carpenter's shop. Very strange scripting. I could go on with this film's many faults but I will resist the temptation. In spite of the inevitable datedness of the '59 version, a fate which all films are doomed to suffer from to one degree or another, the makers of that film understood how to construct a narrative and develop character that emerges from a literate and well crafted script. After many viewings and many years later, I noticed a very subtle yet powerful motif in the film: the recurring image of (or the spoken word of) ""hand"". It is a thread that runs through the film often from beginning to end. You might look for it next time you see the film. I can't imagine such a subtle motif finding its way into a film like this present remake. Great movies are often characterized by attention to details like this. The mode of film production these days, unfortunately, is primarily devoted to producing over the top, viscerally graphic, blood-drenched and frenetic action sequences which the younger set craves and demands. It can be very exciting, I will agree, but all too often it comes at the expense of a well constructed narrative, good acting and a well chosen cast. Time and money do not seem to be channeled into those facets of film making these days. Attention to such elements don't really matter much, in the mind of Hollywood producers of today, if the special effects and action sequences are riveting enough: ""If you jolt them - they will come!"" Would the many 4 and 5 star reviews on this page have been posted if this film had chosen to eliminate those sequences instead of the ones that were in fact not included? I seriously doubt it.  A comparison of these two versions is, of course, a matter of taste as well as the perspective of different generations separated by six decades. For me, the 1959 version, despite its datedness, is a movie. The present offering's DNA is more related to a video game.
An afterthought: Five of six years ago, another remake of Ben-Hur was made as a television mini-series by a Canadian production company. As an admirer of the 1959 version, and William Wyler in particular, I scoffed at the attempt to remake this classic then as well. I was certain it would have to be a dreadful mess. There is a long list of embarrassing attempts to remake classics. (Will someone someday attempt to remake The Godfather? Good Luck!). I decided to watch this new effort and was fully prepared to find it an abysmal failure. I have to admit that after watching it, there were several things about it that I found interesting. Messala's back story was particularly interesting I thought. The mini series did not try to compete with the Wyler version but found its own way in reinterpreting the story, with a much smaller budget and a much younger cast. It is not a great film, to be sure, but I thought they did fairly well given the task they were undertaking. (My biggest problem with it was that the actor who played Ben-Hur looked like one of those blond teen age hunks from the recent TV teen dramas such as Gilmore Girls, Gossip Girl, Dawson's Creek etc.) In any event, I found that remake much more original and worthy than the present effort. Perhaps I was poisoned against this version from the start when I read on-line: ""Director of 'Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Slayer' to helm remake of 'Ben-Hur'."" I remember saying to myself, ""You gotta' be kidding me!""",1482364800,,5293,4.601058201058201

5899210,3,B00E9FIFVS,"It is tough doing a remake of a classic such as the Heston version of Ben Hur in the late 50s.  Sometimes remakes work out well but more often than not they dont.  Even with my skepticism of a modern remake, I was willing to give this movie a chance.

Although I won't say that this matches the height of the 50s classic, this abbreviated version wasn't as bad as a lot of the critics said.  I say this movie is abbreviated because the original was over 3 hours and 30 minutes long versus this one that is just over 2 hours in length.  With that shortened length of the movie it becomes one of the main weaknesses of the movie.  It leaves a lot of the story out of this version and instead chooses to try to appease a modern movie audiences attention span with a 2 hour version.

As it is with remakes, there are also some changes (some big, some small) made in the story that if you have seen the 50s version, you will notice right away.  To a casual audience, that may not be a big issue but is a detriment to those familiar with the story.

Huston as Juddah and Kebbell as Messala are ok in the roles but I cant help but think of some higher profile actors who I think would have been better fits in their respective characters.  Maybe this was a budget decision to choose these actors but at times, especially early on, the acting seems a bit cheesy.  They do seem to get a bit more comfortable in the roles or at least maybe the script writing is better in the second half of the movie.

The climatic chariot race with its modern effects and CGI, I think is well done and is the highlight of the movie to me.  As expected with a movie in 2016, the effects are well done as is the costuming and scenery.

The ending with the two brothers though, I felt was a bit of a letdown and could have been more powerful if they had stuck to the ending from the Heston version.

Although this movie won't match the classic, it does have some things going for it which makes this an ok movie to watch.  It isn't as bad as some critics have described, although it is far from a modern day classic.

I must admit, I have not seen the original, but from what I've researched this is not the same exact story as the Zimbalist/Wyler/Heston epic. Apparently it follows the novel it was based on more accurately. I teach New Testament in a Christian high school and I'm going to use it with the aforementioned movies to help give kids context to that time period of history. From that motivation, I'm happy with this purchase. Now, as far as movies go, it's not up there with say, a ""Gladiator"" kind of epic. It's not THAT good. That's why I gave it 4 stars. I combined my history teacher review with my movie critic skills; a 3 from the movie critic,  and a 5 from the history teacher. I taught 4th grade math for 10 years, and I'm betting that's an average of 4.

I have been a great fan of the many ""sword and sandal"" and ""religious historical"" films starting from ""THE ROBE"" up till now.  This film is not only bad, it cut short much of the original story, such as leaving out Ben
Hur going to Rome,  saving the Roman Consuls life as well as omitting the birth of Christ!  The opening of the 1959 BEN HUR was very inspiring as
well as beautifully photographed with the Star.  The music in the original was magnificent, inspirational and rousing.  As a young man I got the
sound track album and listened to the Music over and over.  There was no opening theme, no birth scene, only a flat ""BEN HUR"" title...It did not
even call it a tale of Christ!  There was hardly any music until the Chariot Race which was effective and well done.. and probably consumed most
of the films budget.  And even here no opening parade music and flags!  The Circus was well done but the photography was a bit less dramatic
as the original.  The sets are very well done,  the Roman uniforms are correct and beautifully done (poor Roman uniforms and costumes in the
'59 film.  Jerusalem was well done though I was unaware that it sat on a high bluff!?!?!  I thought the real city was rather flat!  Anyhow the film runs
rather quickly unlike the '59 one.  Jesus looked quite ordinary and really had little to do in this movie.  The crucifiction(!) was  ok but kind of rushed
through a bit.  And no blood running down the hill to the sea.  Pontius Pilate is portrayed as a real Nasty, probably not historically accurate.  He
is considered a Saint in the Eastern Churches.  Marcella is, believe it or not, somewhat sympathetic..  But the ending, after the Benster gets
his family back is really weird and NOT FAITHFUL to the book (which I read in High School...quite a feat!).  But I will not reveal the ending now but let the watcher beware!!  Two Stars only because I like the sets and the Race.  Otherwise, zero!

The CG for the battle of the oared galleys, for the chariot race, and for the stadium was excellent.  While I missed Quintus Arias and Balthazar, I thought the plot-line for this version was deeper and richer and more three-dimensional and nuanced that the Heston version.  You got much more understanding of Messala, and the actor who played him, while a relative unknown, gave a rich portrayal.  It would be very tough for fairly new actors to match Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd, and they don't quite pull it off, but they perform their roles believably.  Because this version provides a richer background for Judah Ben-Hur and Messala the story is not so much a tale of good versus evil, but of characters who are shaped by, and yet overcome, their circumstances.",1481760000,,900,4.927152317880795

5899257,3,B00E9FIFVS,"The story set during the time of Jesus tells of a wealthy Jewish Noble-Family 'Ben-Hur' who despite the occupation of the
Romans, thrive.
'Judah Ben Hur' (Jack Huston) has grown up alongside his adopted Roman brother 'Messala' (Toby Kebbell) and have
remained close friends.
'Messala' takes up a career as a young man in the Roman Army , his friendship with 'Judah' remains strong, though he has
had to fight many a battle in Germany but after three years returns a decorated officer.
There is trouble in Jerusalem, the Zealots are trying to overthrow the powerful Roman occupation of their city, a new governor
is about to take control 'Pontius Pilate' (Pilou Asbaek) 'Messala' asks his friend 'Judah' to ensure that there will be no trouble
when 'Pilate' arrives to take up his post, though 'Judah' will try, he makes it clear that he has little or no influence over the Zealots.
During 'Pilate's' march into the city 'Judah' and his family watch on from their balcony, a young man that 'Judah' had helped who
was staying at their villa attempts to assassinate 'Pilate' from the roof-top of their home.....bringing an immediate response from
the soldiers who storm into the 'Ben-Hur' household, the young man who had fired the arrow - gone, leaving the accusations at
the feet of 'Judah's' family, to protect his mother and sister he claims responsibility, 'Messala' though knowing that none of his
adopted family were responsible is obliged to save face in front of his contemporaries immediately arrests 'Judah' his mother and sister
...'Judah' will be condemned to working as a slave on-board a Roman war-ship, his mother and sister a more
uncertain future awaits, though talk of crucifixion appears the likely outcome.
While being led to the galley 'Judah' exhausted and beaten is given water by 'Jesus' (Rodrigo Santoro)
Life is hard below deck, five years pass when during a sea-battle n which the ship 'Judah' serves upon is delivered a fatal blow
and begins to sink, 'Judah' struggles to free himself from the chains he is being dragged down by.....he is the sole survivor.
Reaching shore he is found by 'Sheikh Ilderim' (Morgan Freeman) who immediately recognises 'Judah' as a galley-slave, but does
not give him up to the Romans instead seeing how good he is with his horses 'Ilderim' is happy for 'Judah' to work with them
and even trains the once nobleman to race chariots.
However 'Judah' has revenge in mind for his once friend 'Messala' for the wrongs he had inflicted upon both himself and family,
a revenge that will be fulfilled in the arena as both become contenders of a deadly chariot-race.
The story leads on to the crucifixion of Jesus which will deeply affect 'Judah'
The remake of a cinema classic such as 'Ben-Hur' is a tall order, though in my view given the extended versions which made the 1959
film some three and a half hours or so long was probably longer than it should have been it was a cinema-classic made at a time when
many of the great Hollywood-Epics of yesteryear were released, sadly, though there are several impressive sequences not least of which
is the chariot-race, this version is not the equal of what has gone before.
I myself didn't feel the lead characters especially that of 'Messala' were either strong-enough or convincing enough....
It is almost impossible not to draw comparisons with the 1959 version that many if not most will know well...

5899261,1,B00E9FIFVS,"The action was ok as big budget films go, but that is the only thing the movie might be able to praise. The story was totally botched with the theme of vengeance and forgiveness being muddled into a shotgun ending. It's almost like they wanted you to be confused at the end. They didn't give enough attention to Christ, which was necessary for their choice of ending. They would have also needed to give an accurate portrayal of Christ for the movie to make since like the original.

Considering the book and the original movie message was actually Christ centered, this movie downplays Jesus and destroys his deity. My main concern is this movie portrays Jesus as only a grace giving-good person with a message of love, not the miracle performer that the Gospels clearly teach, and because of this the ending is absurd. (The movie didn't even attempt to give any historicity to the Gospels and the acts of Jesus let alone to ancient Old Testament Judaism.) The ending only makes since if you have seen the original movie, otherwise you are left with nonsensical miracles and healing that seem unconnected, because they portray Christ as just a man the whole movie, not a miracle worker.

The ending felt really rushed and makes you focus on the moral of the movie being vengeance not redemption and forgiveness. They failed to tie the forgiveness theme in with any emphasis.

This is just another case where Hollywood has cut out the message of the Gospel and destroyed a good story in the process. I do not recommend this to any fan of the original, to anyone wanting to see a Christocentric message, or to anyone who was hoping for a little historical accuracy concerning the Gospels.

I would also say the chariot race scene, which is the focus of this movie, fell short of the original one with Charlton Heston.",1481673600,7,1816,4.683385579937304

The story line was kind of cheesy at the end. It was also incredible and beyond me how Pontius Pilate allowed Ben Hur to live after he came back.

5899302,3,B00E9FIFVS,"Whenever anybody talks of Ben-Hur the first thing they recall is the chariot race. In William Wyler's 1959 Oscar-winning classic, Charlton Heston flew around that wide expanse of a track, captured in breath-taking 70mm at a time when spectacle like that truly felt like a spectacle. And clearly director Timur Bekmambetov, who previously-helmed Wanted and Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, remembers that chariot scene quite well because it seems to be his main point of interest. Fortunately, the lack of emotional drama isn't enough to completely sink this modern update despite it lacking the prestige of prior versions, but at least it's not 3 1/2 hours long, thank God.

Remaking Ben-Hur was always going to be a difficult proposition, even in today's climate when the most pitiful faith-based movies still find an audience. The most famous version won an astounding eleven Academy Awards, which you'd think would be a deterrent from anybody trying to redo it for any reason. That hasn't been the case by a long stretch. Bekmambetov's hiring signaled immediately this Ben-Hur wouldn't be concerned with Oscars aspirations; blockbuster entertainment geared towards the already-converted was its goal. And that audience will surely find this more palatable than they did Darren Aronofsky's supposedly left-leaning Noah, despite some contemporary changes to the material.

Beginning at the starting blocks of the big chariot race, former Jewish prince Judah Ben-Hur (Jack Huston) and his adoptive brother, the Roman warrior Messala (Toby Kebbell, good luck finding a blockbuster he isn't in), jaw at one another about vengeance and old grievances. They had been like actual brothers once, and the film flashes back to that innocent time. Ben-Hur comes from a wealthy family, born into privilege that he feels very comfortable in, while Messala is the grandson of a Roman traitor involved in Caesar's murder. As an orphan he was taken in and raised by Ben-Hur's family, although the mother (Ayelet Zurer) clearly plays favorites. Shamed by his given wealth and the constant shunning, Messala seeks individual power by joining the Roman legions on their global conquests. Meanwhile, Ben-Hur finds love, and begins to find a new faith in his seemingly random encounters with a certain charismatic and sexy carpenter, Jesus Christ (Rodrigo Santoro).

This is a major change from the book but is closer to how the many adaptations have gone. Another change comes after Messala returns years later, a Roman commander who has fought and won many battles. He needs Ben-Hur's help squashing those who oppose Roman rule, but his brother offers little support. Rather than a falling roof tile it's an arrow shot at Pontius Pilate (Pilou Asbaek as the man who crucified Jesus) which triggers Messala's betrayal of Ben-Hur and his family. Tiles are boring, but an arrow fired by an agitator (Moises Arias) staying in Ben-Hur's home is a twist that makes his downfall more ironic. The once-wealthy prince is thrown in shackles to become a slave, while his family is hauled off to be killed.

Surpassing the chariot race as the centerpiece is the galley scene, a claustrophobic jaw-dropper of hot oil, flaming arrows, and watery death. The 3D is especially good here as projectiles wizz past the rows of battered slaves, including Ben-Hur, all stripped of their humanity and beaten into submission. It's here that Ben-Hur, after years in the galley (we see like 30 seconds of it) decides it's time to go home and get some payback. But first he has to survive. The carnage Bekmambetov unleashes is impressive and horrifying, but not dissimilar to the gruesomeness of his prior work. Let's not forget he's the guy who gave us Wanted, a movie that had ""violence is freedom"" as the basic core message.

Whether you're familiar with the Ben-Hur story or not the characters will feel that way, thanks to a no-frills screenplay by Oscar winner John Ridley and Keith R. Clarke. They breeze quickly through philosophical discussions on faith, freedom, and family, in order to get to the next impressive action sequence. That said, some of the quiet scenes have surprising strength as Ben-Hur wrestles with his desire for peace and need for payback. You can feel the pull within him as he tries to reconcile the man Messala is now with the one he used to share such a brotherly bond with.

Huston doesn't command the screen like Heston did but he brings a sensitivity that makes him endearing and sympathetic. He's not a natural action hero, though, and that is never more apparent than during the chariot race when Kebbell really takes charge. Add to the list of strong performances by Kebbell in movies he's probably too good for, a list that includes Fantastic Four, Warcraft, Wrath of the Titans...and that's just the start. There's a welcome expansion of the female roles, giving Zurer and co-star Nazanin Boniadi the chance to bring a different kind of ferocity than their male counterparts. Santoro feels out of place as Jesus but then that whole parallel storyline, which ends with a smaller, less torturous Crucifixion than The Passion of the Christ, doesn't need to be there. Oh, and Morgan Freeman is here too, completely phoning it in as a rich African gambler (he's a sheik, but they never say it) who finds Ben-Hur, and trains him in chariot racing so he can humiliate Rome in the big arena. Freeman also voices the mostly pointless narration, because what would a Biblical remake like Ben-Hur be without the voice of God?",1480723200,,5512,5.038377192982456

5899315,1,B00E9FIFVS,"Right from the beginning, when this new version was announced, I thought, 'WHY? Why mess with perfection?' Lew Wallace's epic novel Ben-Hur: A Tale Of The Christ had already been done five times heretofore this version: as a short silent in 1907, a spectacular silent in 1925, an epic and Academy Award winning spectacle in 1959, an animated version in 2003 released direct-to-DVD starring Charlton Heston in his final role, and a horrendous miniseries in 2010. Three of the aforementioned are wonderful, excellent, faithful adaptations of the novel (the 1907 silent film doesn't count, as it only covered the chariot race).

What was Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer thinking, remaking Ben-Hur a third time? The first two times they made it, in 1925 and 1959, the results were literally golden and spectacular. This third time...was a spectacular chariot crash. If General Wallace were alive today, this version would cause him to have a massive coronary.

My low expectations for this new cinematic incarnation were met, and surpassed. It is just as bad, if not worse, than the 2010 miniseries, which featured two sex scenes, one of them extremely graphic. Without getting into detail, I will say that Jesus is completely misrepresented in the film, so it is appropriate that this one does not bear the subtitle A Tale Of The Christ, because the Saviour was barely in the film, and His message is watered down so much it smacks of political correctness. In my opinion, a crucial shot in this version looks like it was copied from The Passion Of The Christ. You will know that of which I speak when you see it. There are a lot of historical inaccuracies in the film, which are jarring and distracting. And that pop song at the end...what was that? Sounded like a cat scratching glass.

One of the many reasons this version does not work is the music; save for the leper colony and chariot race scenes, the music here is utterly forgettable, and even the music for the leper colony and chariot race scenes were good but ultimately weak attempts at being epic. Listen to the soundtrack of this version once, and forget it, and then listen to the over three hours of music from the 1959 spectacle over and over. There is literally NO COMPARISON. The music for the former stumbles like the horses in the arena, and the latter races clear across the finish line, and earns the crown of victory.

The differences betwixt the novel and this cinematic waste of celluloid are too many to list here. I will say, though, that you would do well to read the novel first, and then see this version to compare them, and then watch the 1925 silent film, and then watch the 1959 epic masterpiece, and then watch the 2003 animated film (which is a perfect introduction for children to the world of Ben-Hur).

Rated PG-13 for sequences of violence, and disturbing images.",1476316800,9,2840,4.7877551020408164
5899316,2,B00E9FIFVS,"""It's not as bad as I expected.""

I imagine that's not the kind of audience response the makers of Ben-Hur hoped to inspire.

But it's the best I can do for this un-epic faith-based 3D adaptation of the best-selling 1890 novel Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ by lawyer and Union Maj. Gen. Lew Wallace. A populist Christian apologetic, the book is about two violent, vengeful men who reappraise their lives after crossing paths with Jesus.

Directed without much flair or panache by the usually adventurous Timur Bekmambetov (Night Watch, Wanted), this is the sixth screen version of the novel, including that has yielded a 2003 feature cartoon and a clumsy 2010 miniseries. It is best known for Charlton Heston's loud, loutish portrayal in the lavish 1959 studio-made mega-epic.

The new Ben-Hur isn't much of an improvement. Dominated by CGI effects, it's a soap opera better fit for basic cable.

Jack Huston (Boardwalk Empire, American Hustle) stars as Judah Ben-Hur, a suave, Jewish nobleman from Jerusalem who refuses to take sides in the bloody revolts by the Zealots against their Roman rulers. Toby Kebbell (Warcraft) plays Judah's adopted brother and childhood BFF Massala, a brutal Roman officer who enforces Pontius Pilate's (Game of Thrones' Pilou Asbk) Draconian policies.

When a Zealot uses Judah's house to launch an attack against Pilate, Massala puts Judah's entire family to the sword and condemns his brother to life as a galley slave.

Ben-Hur escapes and, aided by a rad-looking, dreadlock-sporting Morgan Freeman, he becomes a chariot racer to challenge Massala, a famous chariot driver. The two men are destined to face off in a deadly battle.

Ben-Hur is riddled with problems. Huston (grandson of film legend John Huston) plays Ben-Hur as a sensitive aesthete. His transformation into a bloodthirsty, avenging warrior just doesn't play. Kebbell's Massala has the opposite problem. He's such a brutish believer in Rome's martial creed, it's hard to believe he'd ever be swayed by the message of Jesus, who is a peripheral character throughout the film.

After all, that's the endgame.

Produced by Mark Burnett, the man behind a slew of faith-based works including Son of God and The Bible, Ben-Hur tries to elicit a spiritual response.

While its depiction of Jesus' suffering is graphic, the film's religious message is so gooey, soft, and feel-good, it might as well be a New Age pamphlet.

Ben Hur just doesn't measure up - either as an action picture or a religious testament.",1476316800,2,2504,5.080487804878048

5899319,4,B00E9FIFVS,"My wife and I saw this version at our ""Second Run"" theater. We read all of the reviews, yet we knew it would appeal to the evangelistic Christian, of which we are.  All of the special effects and the sound were terrific. My only problem is that it did not follow the book.  It left out the rescue of Arrius,and adoption of Judah Ben Hur.  This is an important part of the story.  As others have stated this is not a remake of the 1959 film.  It is a new adpation.  One suggestion if you want to see the movie that has the best screen play based on the novel, watch the silent 1925 version.  In my opinion this is the best of the three!",1475452800,4,635,4.032

The pace is brisk-okay, some parts needed more exposition, not less-and the story is tightly told. Great chemistry among the cast, I laughed, I cried, I gripped the edge of my seat-I loved it. So much, in fact, that I have seen it several times. Can't wait to buy on DVD. Have tissues ready, you may need them.",1474588800,3,557,4.365384615384615
5899323,5,B00E9FIFVS,"I wish I could give this movie ten stars!!  Five just doesn't seem adequate.  The casting of Jack Huston as the lead role was absolutely brilliant!! Stunning performances by the rest of the cast as well.  I enjoyed the '59 version of Ben-Hur (the 3 hours and 44 minutes of running time is a negative element for me) and so was greatly looking forward to the 2016 version.

What I absolutely loathe is that movie reviewers set this movie up for failure.  QUIT COMPARING IT TO THE ORIGINAL VERSION, YOU AWARD-HUNGRY CRITICS!!!! Yes, the original was great, but I thought this movie was even better than the original.  So terrible of me, right?  Yes, there is use of CGI, (hello, which modern movie doesn't use it?) but according to the cast of the movie, they were actually racing horses in actual chariots and did so much of what you see on the screen in person to make it believable.  I certainly think they achieved that!

The amount of thought and care that went into this movie was very apparent.  The development of the characters, the realistic galley and arena scenes, the emotion of Jesus, and the cinematography and musical scores led to an incredible movie- the best movie of 2016 by far.

So much power, depth, love, and forgiveness packed into one movie.  It's rare to see a Hollywood-produced film deliver such quality and valuable morals to it's viewers.  It's increasingly more difficult to go to a movie anymore without there being blatant sexual content, profanity, and overall lack of feel-good elements which makes me feel like I wasted hours of my life.  Does every movie have to leave a lasting impact? No.  But when did all that is crude and profane become the #1 form of entertainment in the film industry?

Thank you Ben-Hur team for creating a movie that allowed me to FEEL something in the theaters again.  You have an amazing platform to reach mass audiences with messages of true love and forgiveness- messages that matter outside of the theater.

I went to see this movie twice in one week and I will definitely be buying this movie for myself and giving everyone I know a copy for birthdays, Christmas, just-because-gifts, you name it. For everyone who won't go to the movie because critics say it's a waste of your time, my message to you is this: Don't be a sheep that just follows the rest of the herd.  Go and see it for what it's worth, and then cast your opinion.  I highly encourage everyone to go see this film- and bring your tissues!! <3",1474416000,10,2476,4.596810933940774

5899326,5,B00E9FIFVS,"Released in 2016 and directed by Timur Bekmambetov, Ben Hur is the tale of two brothers circa 33 AD: Judah Ben-Hur, a privileged Hebrew in Jersalem (Jack Huston) and Messala, an adopted orphaned Roman (Toby Kebbell). After a period of separation, Messala returns to Jerusalem as a Roman commander wanting Judahs help to capture & punish rebels, which isn't received well. Then all hell breaks loose. Can the family ever be restored?  Morgan Freeman is on hand as Sheik Ilderim while Nazanin Boniadi and Sofia Black-D'Elia play Esther and Tirzah, the women Judah and Messala love respectively. Ayelet Zurer is on hand as the Jewish matriarch while Pilou Asbaek plays Pontius Pilate.

This is well-done streamlined version of the classic 1959 movie for the current generation, running just over two hours (125 minutes) as opposed to three and a half hours. Since the 59 film is one of my favorites I know the plot well, so none of the interesting plot turns surprised me, but the story will be more impressive to those who aren't familiar with it. To be honest with you, I wasn't expecting anything that great, particularly in light of it bombing at the theaters; but I was surprised by how good it is. The decision to make Judah and Messala non-blood brothers was a good decision, as were most of the other small changes, like what Judah does to the commander of the galley and the climax. The best parts are, of course, the brutal galley sequence, which is far better than Hestons version, and the chariot race, which is impressively amped up. The more direct depiction of the mighty Christ is another positive change; they chose the right person for the role (Rodrigo Santoro), far better than the relatively bland actor in 2016s Risen. The only part with the Messiah that doesnt really work is the stoning sequence.

In any case, I found the movie engaging from the get-go. The action is interspersed with some quality dramatic scenes, like Judah and Esthers reunion in the alley under an overcast sky. But some dramatic parts couldve been more effective if the filmmakers simply slowed things down rather than rush to the next scene to make sure they don't lose those with ADHD. The miracle at the end is a good example; it couldve been a more moving sequence if done right. But you can nitpick this movie, or any film. At the end of the day, this new version of Ben Hur cuts out the fat for a more kinetic take on the tale. I could care less if the major parts were played by no name actors, because they all do a fine job. For comparison, Id watch this over the overrated Gladiator any day (the arena scenes are far more convincing, as far as the outdoor auditorium and spectators go).

The film was shot in Italy and Painted Canyons, Mecca Hills, California.

5899327,5,B00E9FIFVS,"The new rendition of Ben-Hur is a must see. Not only is this a great movie, this movie will give a desire to forgive without limits, love your brother will all your heart, and to see the goodness in others. The conclusion of this movie is truly a great ""showcase"" of how Sacred Scripture should be practiced.

It saddens me the poor reviews this movie has been given. The only explanation is that the culture that thrives within society today cannot morally identify a great movie when they see one since they have no morals grounds except those that they deem to be moral but is total imagination and falsity.

The long of the short of it is, go watch Ben-Hur when it is released. Forgive some of the movies poor clerical work and watch the movie for watch it is, that of forgiveness and dedication. Also, please do not see this movie as a modern day copy of the 1959 Ben-Hur movie, see it as a distinct rendition of the Ben-Hur written by Lew Wallace.

Spoiler alert. One guy chops off another guys leg and they make up with a hug the next day. The next scene the producers niece is apparently singing in the background while peg leg and his new friend are riding off into the sunset together.  Seriously the only plausible answer is that whoever did the writing of this script, was a girl who has never watched anything other than veggie tales.

5899329,4,B00E9FIFVS,"We already know the end of the story as Ben-Hur (Jack Huston) is synonymous with chariot race. There is no mystery as to what happens to the Jesus character (Rodrigo Santoro) either. Jack Huston is not as a commanding figure as Charlton Heston, nor is he meant to be. They humanized the character.

The film is introduced by Morgan Freeman who later turns up as the desert trader Ilderim. Toby Kebbell plays Messala Severus, a complex protagonist/antagonist character, the adopted Roman brother of Judea Ben-Hur. The costumes were not very historical, the pants suit Ester wears, the saddles with stirrups, modern stitching showing on sleeves cuffs, etc. They attempted to keep things historical, but there may be a few issues there. At least no one was wearing a Rolex (Spartacus 1960).

Be aware there is a mock-buster ""In the Name of Ben Hur"" that is not worth a free viewing.

5899333,1,B00E9FIFVS,"This movie was a rushed choppy piece of crap. It did not have the spiritual and emotional impact that the 1959 version had.
It's as if the guy making it forgot it was a Tale of Christ. There are a few scenes but they don't seem  to have a connection with Judah Ben Hur.
It looked like a gladiator rip off got mixed with a few scenes from a Jesus flick. During the chariot race the editing was so bad you don't see why Masalla crashes. It jumps around too much.
In the 1959 Ben Hur, Judah is constantly questioning who that strange man that gave him water and why.
He comes full circle when he seeks out Jesus with his sick mother and sister only to find out the man who gave him hope is now dying on the cross. The rabbi Jesus who gave him the water. After defeating Masalla, his heart is full of hate, he is replacing Masalla by acting like him. Christ's message of peace and compassion fills his heart.
Nope, not in this crap fest 2016 version. We get this ridiculous clichd Coca Cola ad scene where Judah and Masalla suddenly become best of friends and a race off to the sunset like nothing ever happened.
The Morgan Freeman character looked like Ezekiel from the Walking Dead.
This is what you get when you get the director from Abraham Lincoln vampire hunter to direct a remake of an epic masterpiece like The 1959 Ben Hur.
Personally I am tired of non Christians making Christian movies. Roma Downey should have known better coming off the success of the Bible mini series.
Avoid this choppy rushed clunker and watch the silent film version and the 1959 version. All you need.

Moreover, the Roman soldiers' costumes were more authentic than those in the 1959 classic, and the Roman soldiers marching scene was impressive.

This is not meant to be a classic, it is just a different version of Ben-Hur. My hats off to Paramount and MGM for giving viewers something other than a superhero movie (too many of them).

As I looked forward with great anticipation to the release of the new BEN-HUR, I was really disappointed by all the negative reviews the movie got, well before it was even released.

Having said that, I finally made it to the theater to see the new release of BEN-HUR. To my surprise, I was literally the only person in the whole theater. What a treat!, I thought, a private showing of the new BEN-HUR movie, just for me! Well, at that point I realized the critics had killed it the movie before it was even born! I totally loved it, I guess 3 thumbs up would describe it!

MY REVIEW:  The adaptation of the book was more credible than in its 1959 version. I loved the storyline, it moved seamlessly, and it kept my attention, bringing pleasant surprises, all the way through the end. I loved the different nuances in the script. The score was great but I loved that it didn't interfere or compete with the movie, you didn't even notice it was there, and that's a good thing! It would be unfair to compare the score to the grandiose and opulent scores of the late 50's and 60's when scores were written as masterpieces often times outdoing the film.  I was really expecting to see an effort to remake the 1959 version but was pleasantly surprised by its big differences. I left the movie so enthusiastic and surprised at the same time of how much I loved it! Of course, I would forever be a fan of Charlton Heston's acting in the 1959 MGM BEN-HUR and the Miklos Rozsa lavish score. But I'll also be one of the biggest fans of this 2016 version. Can't wait until it comes out on BluRay, hoping that it includes a good deal of supplementary material. I was blessed to see the movie again with my wife, who also loved it, and a then a third time.

Lew Wallaces great-great-granddaughter, Carol Wallace, wrote a book to accompany the movie.  Its available in Kindle, Paperback, through Amazon.  Theres also a Hardcover and a Hardcover Collectors Edition available.

Interesting Facts:  Before you see this movie, it is important to note that this movie is not a remake of the 1959 film. The new release of BEN-HUR is another movie adaptation of the Novel Ben-Hur: A tale of the Christ written by Lew Wallace and first published by Harper & Brothers in 1880. The book became so popular that it prompted a stage play adaptation that opened November 1899 on Broadway. The Stage Play had over 6000 performances and its estimated that over 20 million people saw it during its 21-year run. The first BEN-HUR movie was filmed in 1907 by a studio called Kalem. An unauthorized 15-minute cheap version of the film.  Henry Wallace, Lew Wallaces son, together with Harper & Bros & Klaw & Erlanger filed a lawsuit that made it all the way to the Supreme Court and ruled in their favor.  Thanks to Henry Wallaces foresight, laws were put in place securing the intellectual property of authors from copyright infringement by film and theatrical productions. The first official movie was filmed 1925 followed by the 11 Academy Awards winner 1959 production.

This newest theatrical version of BEN-HUR was released on August 19, 2016, with a production cost over $100 million.  By October 2016 it has grossed $26.4 million in the US and $62.9 Internationally adding to a  disappointing total gross of $89.3 million.  The top nations in sales outside the USA were South Korea ($10 million), Mexico ($6 million), Brazil ($5.5 million), and Russia ($4.3 million).  Im sure the studio will at least break even after the DVD releases worldwide.

5899348,2,B00E9FIFVS,"A blockbuster of a disappointment with a few admittedly memorable scenes, rendering the film worthy of two-and-a-half stars.

I'm not certain to what extent this unnecessary remake of its brilliant 1959 predecessor was consistent in following Gen. Lew Wallace's novel, and frankly I couldn't care less. Here's what troubled me:

For starters, Judah Ben-Hur -- played rather unremarkably by pretty-boy Jack Huston -- exhibited that perpetual, starry-eyed (dare I say ""leftist liberal"") look about him that continually contradicted the gritty, rugged heroism, so visibly portrayed by the more adept Charleston Heston. On the other hand, Toby Kebbell, as antagonist Mesalla Severus, turned in a more compelling performance, despite the unpersuasive attempt on the part of the scriptwriters to characterize him (through a flurry of pretentious dialogue and self-indulgent overacting) as an embittered Roman, bereft of noble status, who would all too suddenly walk out on (and later betray) the brother and family he so dearly loved. The character of Pontius Pilate, woodenly underdramatized by Pilou Asbaek, appeared hopelessly disinterested (at times nonexistent) in his role as Governor of Judea, as though any effort to ""come alive"" might, in fact, actually kill him. Morgan Freeman, as Ilderim, with the aid of his incomparable voice and unwavering diction, was the strongest among the cast, while Naomi and Tirzah (mother and sister of Judah Ben-Hur, respectively) got lost and left behind altogether in the script.

The direction was uneven, and scenes often jumped artificially from one to the other without warning or transition. A number of them, whether due to time constraints or budgetary considerations, were regrettably omitted: e.g., Ben-Hur does not save Commander Quintus Arrius during the bloody naval battle; nor does he wind up as the latter's adopted son, who is brought triumphantly back to Rome and granted citizenship by the emperor himself. And -- if you'll permit me a bit of picayunish quibbling -- after five punishing years of being chained to his oars as a filthy, disheveled galley slave, Judah's sparkling polished teeth looked as though they'd been subjected to a daily dose of Crest 3D Whitestrips.

POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT:

In the 1959 version of BEN-HUR, the evil, unrepentant Messala, just before dying most deservedly from wounds sustained during the no-holds-barred chariot race, is still bent on spewing his venomous hatred at his erstwhile beloved friend. In the current version, we are treated naively to an improbable, (Kumbaya sort of) epiphany on the part of a more ""progressive"" Messala, who realizes ""the folly of his ways"" and winds up in a tearful, ""forgive-me-bro"" embrace with Judah...WHO, not to be outdone (or out-acted) by his rival, mawkishly beseeches the latter's forgiveness for having stifled his *own* brotherly love to pursue instead his unchristian lust for vengeance against him. It's all too good to be true...it's all too warmhearted and sunny -- a definite audience pleaser of the Hallmark variety -- and therefore totally (Hollywoodishly) unbelievable.

One of the most enduring features of the 1959 production of Ben-Hur was the incomparable Academy Aware winning score by the late Miklos Rozsa, who composed several hours of stirring, evocative music that highlighted the drama brilliantly and unforgettably. During the first year of the film's release (when I was only 13 or 14), I went to the theater 11 times -- just for the music alone. Marco Beltrami's unimpressive score did little to enrich the drama of the current production.  In fact, at the very end of BEN-HUR (2016), when the credits appear, the hokey pop-tune music -- an incongruous letdown, sung by a female, that was cloying to the nth degree -- totally annihilated whatever little feeling of reverence and epic drama I might have gained from the film.  At that point, I got up and walked out of the theater in disgust.

This is the sort of film that lends credence to the oft-stated complaint: ""They just don't make movies the way they used to"" -- and, in my humble opinion, they probably never will.",1472083200,23,4133,5.221719457013575

8602963,1,B00E9FIFVS,"you know that old adage. some things are better left to the imagination . apparently and sadly for some this does not apply .
why is it people ( I say that because I do not know who to blame ) feel the need to explain everything  Judah and  messalas were brothers juda is a jew his brother turned out a roman. why you ask ? I'm glad you did . in the original book  and in the 1959 version we do not know nor do we care .
as much as I love morgan freeman he should know better. his character was not responsible for the survival of Judah that happened through the manipulation of the roman ordering them to go faster
 but Hollywood must have its cgi so there ya go

My wife checked out when we saw the second person wearing ""pants"" and I managed another couple of minutes--until Judah Ben-Hur revealed he was way woke and so ahead of his time--that, or some kind of ""non-violent"" agnostic time-traveler from the early 21st century.
