8353707,3,B0026WJ3AI,The information was good and interesting.  It was just too short.  I would have liked for it to have had more information.,1365206400,,122,4.5
8353708,5,B0026WJ3AI,"My sons like to watch this over and over and over again.  The re-enactment of the battle between St. George and the dragon is well worth it!  It is a bit high priced at retail for the amount of time, and hopefully the price will drop as this is on the market longer, but these were done as theater-quality programs to be shown as a grouping with other DVDs related to the Bible and science.  So I think that is why the price is kind of high.  But the quality is excellent, and the content is so intriguing!",1325548800,4,506,4.13265306122449
8353709,5,B0026WJ3AI,"This 14 minute video is about the multitude of past legends of dragons (or should we say dinosaurs C the term dinosaur wasn't coined until the 1800s).  It builds a powerful case based on historic tales of large unusual creatures from all around the entire earth, that men and dragons lived at the same time.  I found it extremely useful in a Sunday School class that I teach.  I knew it was short before I bought it because I had already previewed it at the Creation museum in Kentucky, so I didn't have any issues with regard to that as the other reviewers did.  Anyway, for a short video it is very good.",1309996800,5,606,4.336283185840708
8353710,2,B0026WJ3AI,"I am a Christian and believe the Bible to be completely true.  I agree with all the information provided in the DVD (fossils are a result of Noah's flood and ""dragons"" may have been dionsaurs).  However, this was a 14 minute video which is way too short for that type of price.  It mainly consists of pictures (not moving pictures) and a person narrating as the pictures/drawings flash across the screen.  I bought this DVD for my boys who LOVE creation-based archeology.  We all found this to be kind of boring.  It just states a few facts, shows a few pictures, and then it's over. I wouldn't recommend this.",1278460800,8,610,4.5504587155963305
8353711,1,B0026WJ3AI,"Untill now there was no product description nor the slightest hint of the content and quality of this DVD except for the cover art. As a collector of this kind of material I finally gave in to curiosity and ordered it. My heart sank as soon as I read Creation Museum on the back cover. Before you read further, understand this.
  I am a Sold-Out-The-Whole-Route-Born-Again-Church Going-Believer myself, and prowd of it. And that is all I will say about that in this forum. I only say that much because it directly partains to the opinions expessed about this product. I harbor no Anti-Christian sentiments in the writing of this review.
  I do have serious problems with the lack of information prior to this purchase. In this case it speaks to a deliberate masking of facts pertinant to a buyer's decision to even buy this product. And it is hard to read it any other way.
  First, the whole video is only 14 minutes long! Cost wise that works out to over 50 cents a minute viewing time. That isn't much value for your buck. The contents shows several ""experts"" familier to this ministry, giving the standerd opinions of how dragons and dinosaurs were drowned in Noah's flood. And that is all. Show's over. There is no attempt to give any broad view of the subject matter on any level. There is the addition of websight addresses to get more ""information"" on. But this does not counter ballance the lack of content on this DVD.
  Second, the title, ""Dinosaurs And Dragon Legends"" implies that there is a wide expance of information in the offing. Nothing could be further from the truth. There is the Concervative Creationist ,Young Earth, King James Genisis Story and all the implications drawn from it. And that's all. That is why the lecture is only 11 minutes long. A point of view that limited doesn't take very long to present. For this reason I have to say that there is very little educational value in this DVD. The content can be most accurately described as propaganda. All the ideas are presented as ""point of view"" and ""conclusions"". The air of the presentation is authoritative giving an impression of truth to the ideas expessed. But in truth, this is only one, very small interpritation of a very large subject.
  The marketing here is classic Bait-And-Switch tactics. There is no mention of the Bible or any religious affiliation evident in the marketting of this DVD. This is an over priced Sunday School tool for a children's class. And only if one can accept the deceptive language and flawed logic inherant in all the Creationist teachings.
  IMHO, The Infinate Creator Of All Things does not need His believers to dumb down every aspect of reality into an easily understandable five thousand year old universe. The study of Nature and Science reinforces the existance of God. Knowledge does not disprove or invalidate faith. For me, the choice of Science or God forced by Creationist teaching is not valid. The third, perfectly sound choice is the study of Science reinforces  and proves the power and complexity of God's creativity. Science is not a substitute for Faith. And it was never ment to be. Nor am I alone in this view. Any practicing doctor,vet,geologist,or other church going profesional in the sciences will say the same thing. Belief in God and Science are not exclusive to each other. Science is the study of God's universe. For this reason, I can not recommend this DVD even for a teaching tool. The ideas presented as fact are only hollow opinions.
  For a good informative treatment of this material, buy the History Channel's DVDs about dragons and legends. The material is presented in it's proper perspective without any New Age confusion about whether or not dragons really existed.
  In conclusion, my opinion about this product and it's value, or lack there of,is based on my taste as a DVD collector, a fantasy, sci fi fan, a professional artist and film maker,a scholar, and a Christian. I hope that this critique is accepted only as a product overview. I presented my personal opinions as they partained to the value of this DVD. And that is all.
  I waited for over a year for someone, particularly the maker of this DVD, to post some information about it. Nobody did. I finally filled in the much needed gap.  ""nuff said""",1276128000,8,4274,4.75
