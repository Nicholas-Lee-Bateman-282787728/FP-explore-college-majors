7315302,5,B010OKHZTE,This documentary was lovingly filmed by the grandson Lloyd Handwerker of Nathan Handwerker who founded Nathan's Hot Dogs and built it into a multi-million dollar business. It is a true success story of a Jewish family fleeing an oppressive Europe and coming to New York to make a new life for themselves in addition to founding this business. The grandson interviews all of his relatives who were either involved with the business or were close with his grandfather(who was by now deceased). Their recollections of a New York which is now long gone as well was very touching and moving. Well worth watching.,1466726400,,607,4.902912621359223
7315303,5,B010OKHZTE,"The 2016 Documentary by Nathan Hanwerker's Grandson Lloyd,it tells the story of Nathan's life,his sometimes turbulence with his family and Working of His Hot Dog stand,now 100 Years Old! I highly recommend this!",1462320000,,211,5.424242424242424
7315304,5,B010OKHZTE,"Like a hot kosher frank with all the works, ""Famous Nathan"" not only filled me up with a great story but delighted this viewer with a portrait of Coney Island through its ups and downs. Grandson Lloyd does his eponymous grandfather justice with a portrayal that is equally loving and unflinching. Lloyd Handwerker grew up in awe of the family patriarch and, by the looks of it, started making this film in the late 80s while he was in college. Nathan Handwerker, by contrast, grew up poorer than dirt in an Eastern European shtetl before finding his way onto a converted cattle ship alone while still a teenager, bound for New York. (Some of his siblings were to follow.) He died in 1974 but his voice is woven through the film, care of a reel to reel interview recorded by one of Lloyd's cousins who was himself hoping to chronicle some of the family lore. That voice, still heavy with a Yiddish accent, even into his 80s, brings to life a time in New York when the challenges were numerous and the possibilities seemed endless. In 1912, when Nathan arrived on these shores, Coney Island was like no place on Earth. It was like Disneyland crossed with a Google Lab at a time when lots of people still lived without electricity. Many launched enterprises and small businesses but through tenacity, business instincts and chutzpah, Nathan and his business went from a single small food stand to occupying a half a city block in one of the best locations in Coney selling hot dogs, fries and clams. When Nathan purchased the property under his business (for twice the amount that his lawyer thought was sensible) he said, ""I didn't just buy a piece of land. I bought a business for my whole life and for my children to take on."" That sentiment was as true as it was fraught.

The parallel story to Nathan's success is the internal struggles among family members and long time employees, many of whom felt and were treated like adopted familials. This was a (giant) hot dog stand where people got a job and stayed for decades. At the center of the conflict was the competing visions of Nathan's eldest son Murray (who would take the company public to launch a thousand franchises) and a number of managers (including Nathan's long suffering nephew) who express their regret that the whole thing couldn't have remained local. The matter of which direction Nathan himself preferred is tossed around like a hot knish. Although by some accounts tyrannical at times (if not fanatical) in the way he ran his business, the thing that mattered most to this mensch among men seems to have been giving people a chance and doing the right thing.

But stop reading reviews and Go watch this movie! You won't regret it.",1453507200,4,2703,4.664570230607967
7315305,5,B010OKHZTE,"As a Long Islander, I grew up going to Nathan's in Oceanside, NY. What a story, actually quite sad. Well told and the visuals are outstanding. Highly Recommended.",1451692800,,162,4.821428571428571
7315306,5,B010OKHZTE,This movie makes you smile. Iconic Nathan's history as well as dish on the family squabbles. A real bunch of characters!,1448582400,,120,4.761904761904762
7315307,4,B010OKHZTE,"Two stories  one about the building of a major brand name; the other about family issues  with some funny stories but it needed editing
If you are anywhere in the Northeast US and someone says hot dog you usually reply Nathans. The full-block stand still running at its original location in Coney Island, NY and in a few months will celebrate its centenary. No, its no longer run by the original family  it was sold many years ago and is now franchised. But the original founder  Nathan Handwerker  ran it with a strong arm during his lifetime and  his sons and other family members worked there too.

This 96-minute documentary was written, produced, directed and narrated by his grandson, Lloyd. It would never have been possible without Lloyds dad and other relatives having made LOTS of home movies and preserved them. Lloyd (Ill use his first name to define which Handwerker Im talking about), has basically edited these hours of home movies along with interviews he did with family members and long time (30-40 year long) employees. Some of the employee interviewees are really funny  especial the guy who would, not only smoke marijuana, but came to work one day on LSD!).

There are really two stories being told here: One is the history of the company (Nathans)  some of which is told by Nathan himself from a recorded interview  his only one. The other is a story of a family that cant get along and fights all the time. That is really much less interesting, in my opinion. I also felt that Lloyd could have used a good editor as way too often the camera continues to film an interviewee long after they have made their point.

This is Lloyds first film as a director. He was a cinematographer on nine other films. And this inexperience shows. But Im still glad I saw the film  I just filtered out the family arguments and concentrated on the history of the company  and its demise when it tried to expand.  And, for that, Id recommend it.
There are two bonuses. First there is a full-length directors commentary, which I have not listened to. The second is a series of deleted scenes that total about 15 minutes. Honestly, Im glad these were here. Some really should have been in the film (which some film parts should have been removed.). There is a great story of how Nathan was able to walk into a bank and EASILY borrow $750,000 on his reputation alone.
The story of Nathans (the company) has never been told. It took Lloyd 25 years to do this. Yes, its a vanity project, but Im glad I saw it once.

If you aren't hungry before watching this film, you certainly will after you are done.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

7315310,5,B010OKHZTE,"Truly enjoyable!!! Shows the making of Nathan, where he came from, and how he achieved his success.  One thing that truly struck me was the way he cared for his employees which in turn led to his having their respect, appreciation, trust and loyalty; these people worked with pride and to no end because he cared for them.

8722861,4,B010OKHZTE,"Good homemade doc, doesn't quite live up to the brand or Nathan Handwerker.  The loyal employees really stood out, many working there decades or their whole working life. Not bad for an overgrown hot dog stand.. Unfortunately and to no one's surprise, some family members cared more about profits than people and the brand went downhill.  Today,  some faceless corporation gives us an average product at best.

Wish this would have had more about Nathan, a bit too much time spent on his greedy, no business sense brother.  3.5 / 5 stars.",1517875200,,538,4.804347826086956

Contains lots of tidbits and meditations on the immigrant experience, inter-generational conflicts, vagaries of popularity depending on decade trends and management quality, value of hard work ethics and maintaining integrity, necessity of adapting to change both external and internal, inevitability of aging, etc.  Cool vintage footage and kitschy film feel.",1499990400,,429,5.903225806451613

I just did not find the film very interesting.  It may appeal to people on the east coast,  New Yorkers or or to people who have been to the Coney Island Nathan's.",1470787200,,499,4.595505617977528
