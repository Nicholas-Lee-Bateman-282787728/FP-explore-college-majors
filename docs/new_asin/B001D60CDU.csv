8291909,1,B001D60CDU,"I wish I could return this for a full refund.  Demonstration of horses forced to do challenges under the influence of stress and anxiety.  A flag was waved in the face of horse to try to get it to turn, butt ropes were used to force a horse to cross over a tarp.  I could not watch the demo of ropes on the horses fetlocks to make it go over the tarps.  I was hoping for a gentle reading of horse body language and how to incorporate that into training.  I think that Tom Dorrance was a kind and gentle soul who understood horses, but this video did not help me to understand his perspective.  Buck Brannaman's 7 Clinics video is a much better investment.",1486252800,2,655,4.2
