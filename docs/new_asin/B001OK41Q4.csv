8330728,5,B001OK41Q4,"When I was just learning to cook, the explanation for how to make baked beans began with the instruction to spread out the beans in a shallow pan and sort them. I did that. I rolled those beans all around that pan, but they all looked the same size and color. I went on ""sorting beans"" like that for years before someone happened to watch me... and show me that ""sorting beans"" is an instruction left over from the days when beans were home raised, and the sorting was about taking out any small debris that might be left from gathering/drying the beans. Watching this dvd was like that. I'd been doing mokume gane for a year, and ""everyone"" knows to stick the clay onto the tile before cutting. Well, wait to you see what that means. And it's as easy to do as giving up bean sorting.

This tape shows the mokume gane process, from start to finish, and includes the reasoning behind each step. It's like a magician revealing the simplicity of the tricks. Aimed at newcomers, I suppose, but inspirational for the I-already-know-how-to-cook-beans set.",1236816000,14,1049,4.609625668449198
