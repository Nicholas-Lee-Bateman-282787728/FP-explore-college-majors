Campy and smart, I saw it twice in theaters and am looking forward to its release on DVD. I'm a sucker for a good cast (as you'd see in all of my movie reviews on Netflix and here) and this cast's synergy is crazy amazing. Definitely check it out and then come thank me later.

6994414,5,B00SXYM8W8,"My pre-order is placed!

I saw this film with a couple friends at the Chicago Comedy Film Festival in 2013 where it won both Best Feature and Best Actor (for Brandon Alexander III).

We laughed until we cried.  It's one of the funniest movies I've seen in years.

A short while later, we had a chance to watch it streaming online at another film festival that also allowed for online viewing and the film was just as funny the second time around.  In fact, I caught a number of jokes I missed the first time because I was laughing too hard.

I can't wait to get this movie on DVD and share some laughs with friends again.",1423526400,9,621,4.264957264957265
6994415,5,B00SXYM8W8,"I haven't laughed this hard at a movie in a long time. Granted, a few of the jokes fall flat, but this is a hilarious film with a few not-so-subtle references to great 80s movies. It also contains so many great one-liners you'll be quoting for days. Give it a shot! All the totally rockin' superstar extraordinaires are doing it.",1486080000,,329,4.5
6994416,5,B00SXYM8W8,"This movie is witty, campy, and well thought out.

6994418,4,B00SXYM8W8,"My first impression of this film was ""meh""...but I keep watching it. It keeps creeping up in my mind and makes me smile.

You can tell that they had to get creative to make this movie on a low budget. The cut corners are very obvious, but that quickly becomes part of the charm to this film. The cast is 100% dedicated to telling this odd story and make you smile.

The film is filled with cameos from the LGBT industry and I believe they supported the right project. It's a raunchy comedy that makes no promises or apologies.

It's just a great time!",1475280000,,551,4.278846153846154

It's a B or C movie for sure, and it borrows a lot of the typical high school cliches (they even stuck the teen witch rap battle in it).  There's some good jokes, and it's just weird enough to like.",1473033600,,313,4.114754098360656

6994432,5,B00SXYM8W8,"Well, color me shocked and surprised. I never would have thought in a zillion years that I would love this movie as much as I did. So very funny and major camp, too. But camp done well and that adds to the funny. The laughs were everywhere so it would be impossible to start and single any out. The 2 main characters are girls, they are that in the movie but played by 2 guys...but they are girls, not in drag, they are girls, you have to keep that in mind. Let me make this clear, they and the entire cast are truly hysterical. ""didn't we tell you not to talk, just take off your shirt"" (you'll see). Recommend this for any and everyone, you just need to be ready to have fun.",1446595200,,677,4.097744360902255
6994433,4,B00SXYM8W8,"This is one of those movies that I ended up liking, though I'm a little embarrassed for liking it.  Cassie and Maggie are two misfits - for several reasons - teen ""girls"" who become fast friends when the overly optimistic Cassie goes to high school after being home schooled her whole life by her mother (played by none other than Cassandra Peterson - Elvira) and becomes besties with the hapless Maggie.  The stage is now set for the odd girls out to battle the A crowd for dominance and quite a bit of silliness ensues.  This isn't exactly a classic, but it was good, silly fun and the acting was pretty decent throughout.  The over the top fun suited the theme especially as our two heroines are actually boys in drag.  I got several good laughs out of this movie and I wasn't even drinking at the time.",1444780800,,806,4.418918918918919

6994439,1,B00SXYM8W8,"Oh my gosh, I don't even know where to begin with this one! Yes, I do know where to begin with this one. The movie was awful, I had to totally agree (you're welcome) with the two reviewers that gave this the very lowest star, there really was not anything funny about this movie at all. I watched it twice to be sure I was watching the same movie some reviewers who gave it more stars and unfortunately it was the same movie. Buyer beware and save your money. I would give it no stars but because of the rating sysytem I have to give it at least one, if Amazon could cut that one in half it would be getting the appropriate number of stars it deserves.",1439078400,2,652,4.1015625
6994440,5,B00SXYM8W8,"I first saw this movie on Netflix after reading the ""Synopsis"". It intrigued me so I had to see more. I'm glad I did, too. This is such an amazingly hilarious movie. Cassie Glenn, (Totally Rockin' Superstar Extraordinaire... You're Welcome), has me laughing out loud in almost every scene she's in. From her lines to her facial expressions, I could not get enough. It is very cheesy and campy, but also very smart. If you watch one indie movie this year, make it this one! The two female leads in the movie are played by men, but that's what makes the movie and the jokes shine even more. It's been around a month since I've since I first watched it and I still watch it at least every other day. I literally ""LOL"" every time I watch it. If you appreciate campy humor, you will love this movie!

6994446,5,B00SXYM8W8,"Funny Funny Funny!  I've been Dubsmashing this movie like crazy!  I may turn it into a one-man show.
The writing and acting are great, especially as a drag-comedy.  The actors approach these characters as people, rather than one-note girl imitations.
Maggie could be a really sad character, but Beene always lets her go up to the edge, then brings her back at the right moments.
Cassie's unmitigated confidence is hilarious and inspiring.
Great as an original story & fabulous tribute to 80's coming of age comedies.",1432771200,4,516,4.976744186046512
6994447,5,B00SXYM8W8,"I have seen some real duds lately, and just when I was wondering why I watch movies, along comes First Period to remind me why. It is an instant gay classic. Not only does it star two drag queens, but there is hot guys (one of whom is shirtless pretty much every time he's onscreen, gay icon Cassandra Peterson (aka Elvira) in a supporting role, and it is as campy as a campy comedy can get. I've never had my first period, because I'm not a girl. But if all first periods are as good as this, then I feel like I have really been missing out!",1431734400,3,542,4.074766355140187

I bought this movie after seeing the trailer and reading the reviews here on Amazon.  Took a chance and I don't regret it.  Anyone who doesn't find this movie funny must have their funny bone broken.  There were times, some of the sight gags or lines had me laughing so hard, I was absolutely in tears!  How these two guys stay in character and deliver those lines is brilliant.  For those of you that have seen the movie, recognize Cassie's mom?  How about the art teacher or Dirk for that matter?  I can only hope these two guys will produce more movies with those characters.",1430956800,8,673,4.40650406504065

Drop Dead Gorgeous is one of my favorites - This movie I have already watched it twice and found things I haven't heard before because I was laughing so hard - BUY THIS movie  you won't be sorry. Paid homage to so many of my childhood movies....  Well done! Bravo  - these characters need their own TV show - Comedy Central should pick up on this.,1430784000,8,462,4.111111111111111

6994451,4,B00SXYM8W8,"I streamed this movie over the weekend and was really blown away by how funny it was.  There were a lot of scenes that I literally LOLd.

The story line is very reminiscence of Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queena weird girl with an odd overly inflated ego shows up at a new school, befriends other weirdos and launches a campaign to become popular.  Despite her detractors, she stays positive and upbeat throughout and ultimately triumphs, kinda.

The rapid-fire conversations have hilarious one-liners and come so quickly you have to rewatch to get them all.  The movie would have gotten a solid five stars if it weren't for two objections.  First, there was a minor technical issue with the streaming version I watched.  There were sections of the film where the audio didn't sync with the characters mouths.  That may only be a streaming problem or may have something to do with my connection speed.  The second problem was the laugh-out-loud dialogue didn't maintain the momentum for the entirety of the movie.  Toward the end, the funny parts were fewer and farther between.

This movie is definitely a must-see for anyone who appreciates campy humor.",1428883200,5,1158,4.887179487179488

6994453,5,B00SXYM8W8,"Written by and starring Brandon Alexander III who plays Cassie. She is the new girl at school and like all teens she just wants to be popular, date the hottest guy, eat sugary deserts and win the talent competition. Problem is Heather and the Other Heather are already super cool and have the boyfriends - the cute Brett and his best bud Dirk  who is hotter than Satan's Microwave.

On her first day she meets Maggie (Dudley Beene) who is about as popular as a pork pie at a Bar mitzvah. But girls will be girls and they soon hit it off. The problem is when you have super biatch's like the Heather's in the mix it means all competition has to be eliminated and dreams must be trashed or they will not remain uber cool. Cue a week of shenanigans, loose underwear and partays,  (sic) oh and some actual sick!

This is a genuine comedy with laughs scattered throughout like mozzarella on a 12"" pizza - with a stuffed crust.  Even the school teacher (Mr Klein) is dysfunctionally brilliant. Everyone gets to have a few good lines and the warmth shines through. This is one of those films that are destined to become a cult classic or even better. I enjoyed every single second and can't wait to watch again. After years of alleged `comedies' where you can cram all the best lines into a thirty second trailer, it is a breath of fresh air to get one which keeps the hits coming; and that is right up to the final scene. I simply can not recommend highly enough, watch alone, watch with friends, watch drunk or sober or any way you choose but just watch it - excellent.",1428019200,7,1564,4.379310344827586
