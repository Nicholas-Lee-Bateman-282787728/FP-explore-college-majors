8472735,5,B005H7WE14,"Rachmaninov's Second Symphony completes the program in the beautiful Teatro Real.
I was fortunate to see Madrid and visit El Prado Art Museum. There is a short train ride from Madrid to El Escorial, where the kings and queens of Spain are buried. Take the Spanish language tour of El Escorial to hear ""puro castellano"" which is not spoken in Mexico or Caribbean countries.
I recommend the film ""Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown"" by Pedro Almodovar for views of Madrid and lots of laughs.
The town of Aranjuez, located between Madrid and Toledo, was the summer home of the Spanish kings.
Many French composers saw Spain as an exotic country. Chabrier's Espana and Ravel's Bolero are examples of French composers giving homage to Spain.
Don't miss the bonus interview with Simon Rattle, who conducted this concert.",1353542400,2,821,4.913669064748201
8472736,3,B005H7WE14,"I admit it- I am a Simon Rattle fan. I have been for nearly 30 years- ever since he first lit up the classical music world. No mere flash in the pan, he is the real deal. I do not enjoy his concerts because he might be considered ""fun to watch"". His concerts are enjoyable because he always has something interesting to say with the music in the program. This concert is no exception. This would be, as one previous reviewer said, a good Blu-ray demonstration disc. Top marks for the audio and video quality, although I do have to crank up the sound system considerably higher than usual. Having said all that- I wonder who got the idiotic idea that it would be a good gimic to put the foundation of the guitar concerto world in the hands of a flamenco guitarist? Don't get me wrong- I love flamenco. In fact, I started out as a flamenco guitarist before I migrated to classical guitar several decades ago. But this is an embarassment on virtually every level of measurement. I am not familiar with the soloist but I am sure he is probably a fine flamenco guitarist. But he is way out of his depth here. I have no idea why anyone would think that this concerto, because it was written by a Spanish composer, would be a natural for a flamenco player. But it certainly is not. Having played this work several times myself, I found it to be an excruciating experience througout. Going into the performance I was curious about what a flamenco influence might bring to the work. As it turns out, not much. Rodrigo himself was notoriously critical and demanding when it came to performing his music. He would never have approved of this ""performance"". I won't even mention the soloists horribly anemic tonal quality. Oops - I guess I just did. My goodness. What a trainwreck. But the remainder of the program is worth the price of the DVD. Just be prepared to skip the Rodrigo. Unless you like this sort of thing. Oh- one more thing- the special features are worth the time also. Classical music DVD's rarely have any special features, and, when they do, they rarely amount to anything beyond advertisements for other DVD's. But this program, I hope, will help change that. High marks all around. Except for the Rodrigo. No marks for that.",1345852800,2,2233,4.543424317617866
8472737,5,B005H7WE14,"I was intrigued by the idea of a flamenco artist playing the Rodrigo concerto with the Berlin Orchestra and it was for that reason that I took the gamble and bought the disc. My personal favourite performance of this concerto up to this point had been the Bream/Gardiner CD which is excellent by any standards. I had some reservations about the Rachmaninov as neither the orchestra nor Simon Rattle are famed for such repertoire. I thought that sheer on-the-edge Russian fire (Svetlanov or Ashkenazy for example) might not exactly be a natural for them. Indeed their very sophistication might be a hindrance. As regards the Chabrier - well, quite an enjoyable make-weight but hardly the reason for purchasing such a disc.

I have now seen the disc 3 times and both I and my wife have been completely bowled over by the Rodrigo concerto on each occasion - a wonderful revelation and quite the best we have ever heard. Astonishing delicacy displayed by all is the over-riding impression coupled with a tight overall control of rhythm (as you might expect).
The Rachmaninov isn't bad either. Not the Russian fire as explained above but not the over-attention to small details that I feared from Simon Rattle either. Instead we get a deeply felt and convincing central European reading which is very well recorded as expected and which serves as a very satisfying alternative non-Russian view. One that is far more effective than the earlier version recorded by Maazel with this orchestra in my opinion. The Chabrier is OK!

Altogether an excellent concert here though that will surely give a great deal of pleasure to a great number of people - including doubters like me! Well done to all concerned.

Extra note for Rachmaninov enthusiasts
If a really authentic Russian sounding performance of the Rachmaninov is the key interest I would suggest investigating the 2007 double DVD set of the Symphony 2 under Bychkov coupled with The Bells and The Symphonic Dances plus 2 hours of illustrated documentaries on Arthaus - riveting performances throughout in excellent sound and vision.",1343520000,4,2080,4.988472622478386
8472738,5,B005H7WE14,"The Berlin Philharmonic have just completed two decades traveling to a different country of Europe every May 1st for their anniversary concert.  The Second Europa Konzert was conducted by Daniel Barenboim at the Escorial in 1992, with the assistance of Placido Domingo singing several operatic segments.  The Escorial has far too resonant an acoustic, and the building battled the musicians through the whole concert.  Now the Twenty-First Europa Konzert was been conducted by Simon Rattle at a far more favorable venue, the Teatro Real in Madrid.  The video contains a nice balance of close-ups and long-shots, and allows one to get a sense of the house, which has a very deep amphitheater.  The blu-ray clarity allows one to see the various cameras at work, one rolling back and forth right in front of the stage and filming both audience and performers from a low angle.  That angle becomes extremely important during the featured middle piece, the Concierto de Aranjuez, but also plays a nice role in the other two.
It is a shame to bring the Berlin Philharmonic all the way down from Germany and then excuse half of them for the middle feature, which requires much smaller orchestral forces.  They conclude the evening with a magnificent performance of Rachmaninoff's second symphony, which shows they had more music in them than the program let them play.  One wonders why the Russian composer appears in the Spanish concert, and the only connection I can think of is stylistic.  Rodrigo and Rachmaninoff were both romantic composers, and their pieces on this program are among the most nostalgic ever written.
Caizares (full name Juan Manuel Caizares) gives a flamenco-flavored account of the concerto.  Some of the orchestral players seated behind him seem a little dubious about his interpretation.  No doubt he brings out a quality of the music that would not be accessible otherwise.  Caizares once collaborated with his fellow flamenco guitarist Paco de Lucia on a recording which included this concerto, so he brings some experience to the performance.  It is good to have a recent high-definition audio recording of the concerto to add to one's collection, and a little different take on the old war-horse is certainly welcome.  The piece was played throughout the Franco period (1940-1978) for its nostalgic qualities, like a dirge for the trauma of the Civil War.  In 1981 when I visited Spain for the first time, the piece was still streaming from radios all day long.  Then later with the triumph of the Socialists the mood of the nation changed, and the music changed with it.  Now with perhaps the piece is making a comeback.",1318550400,10,2645,4.988610478359909
8472739,4,B005H7WE14,"I've usually been impressed by these Europa Konzert dvd's, especially last year's with the Elgar Cello Concerto and Brahms' First Symphony.

The main item here is that best known guitar concerto, the Concierto de Aranjuez by Rodrigo. The soloist, Canizares,is new to me. Apparently, he is a flamenco artist of some repute, and I can see why. As a guitarist of no repute myself, I can appreciate the skill here. On the bluray you can see the fingering and string-bending in all its glory, and the piece is beautifully rendered. A real winner!. Rattle and the BPO accompany flawlessly.

The Rachmaninov 2, not one of my favorites, is played very well. I just think it's too long and inconsequential. I quite liked movements 2 and 4. The adagio could have used a bit more passion.

The intro, Chabrier's Espana, is done well, if not showing much of the nationalistic color of early exponents such as Argenta or Ansermet. Rattle does not do Spanish accents that well, in my view. This is an issue shared by most British conductors. I know - I'm British.

The recording is outstanding both visually and sound-wise. This is a great demo bluray disc.

Despite my reservations, this is a worthwhile purchase. I got mine from Amazon UK, which was less expensive by several dollars, including delivery, than from Amazon USA. Always check new releases on both the USA and UK sites. Sometimes one is cheaper, sometimes the other.",1317945600,10,1417,4.814814814814815
