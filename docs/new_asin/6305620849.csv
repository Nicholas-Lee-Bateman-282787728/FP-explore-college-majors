1055882,5,6305620849,"I watched the Kino DVD of PETER PAN last night and was delighted to have this most charming of silent films finally available in a quality video release.
The picture quality, which was subtly tinted,  will disappoint  no one, although it looked more like a really good 16mm print than a 35mm  to me.  Perhaps I'm spoiled because I've never seen the film in any  gauge  but 35mm.  A great deal of the magic in PETER PAN was supplied by  cinematographer James Wong Howe. Scenes that could have been foolish in  other hands became enchantment in his.
Phil Carli's score works  perfectly:  It had that ""turn of the century, concert in the park on  Sunday afternoon"" feel to it.  It wouldn't have worked with many  silent films, but for PETER PAN it was marvelous------a  tribute to Carli's  ability to match a narrative theme with it's programmatic musical  compliment.
PETER PAN is filled with magical touches that never seem to  go too far or become foolish.  Peter's heart to heart talk with the  crocodile when they conspire to ""get"" Captain Hook was one of my  favorites, as were the mermaids on the beach. The only point that has ever  bothered me is at the end when Peter actually stabs and kills two of the  pirates.  Somehow I thought this was out of place and brought too much  realism to a light hearted fairy tale.  But this is very minor nit-picking  of an otherwise flawless silent film.
The ""value ads"" are  production stills from the film along with a poster and lobby card.  There  are also interviews with Esther Ralston (one video and three audio), who  plays Mrs. Darling.  The things she has to say about Louis B. Mayer are  more than just interesting.
A title card at the very beginning tells the  audience that the acting may seem whimsical to an adult but that ""all  the characters are seen with a child's outlook on life.....even to the  adults in the story.  Pull the beard on a pirate and you would find the  face of a child.""  So for 102 minutes, clap your hands and pretend you  believe in fairies.

1055954,4,6305620849,"This is a really great screen adaptation of the stage play.  It is well shot, though the camera remains static, and the print quality is beautiful.  You can tell from watching this that it was the main visual influence for the Disney version which came out almost 30 years later.  I always wondered why the lost boys in the cartoon were wearing animal pajamas ... and now I know.

Nana is played by a guy in a dog suit, but he does an incredible job.  This was about 50 years before Muppets; Nana's performance in the first few scenes will make your jaw drop.  Simply amazing pantomime puppetry - it couldn't have been easy to do that.  There's a pack of wolves later, as well as a lion and the famous crocodile; all people in costumes.

Peter is played in a completely manic over-the-top performance by Betty Bronson.  Her cocky stance, expansive gestures, wide eyes and crazy grin had me cackling with glee.  I think another reviewer mentioned how weirdly sexy she is in this role, and I'd have to agree.

Speaking of sexy, Tinkerbell (in the 4 or 5 close-ups of her) looks beautiful in her diaphonous wind-blown gown.  The shot of her tugging on the dresser-drawer handle has got to be among the greatest single shots in early cinema.  It's an impressive effect, even today.

Captain Hook hams it up delightfully as a melodramatic villain.  He is unapologetically vile ... but he has good manners!

The special effects are pretty impressive for 1924, and they hold up pretty well today.  Tinkerbell's first appearance is actually startling; it took me a while to figure out how they might have done it.  The kids are on wires when they fly around, but hey ... what do you expect?  The director didn't try to do more than he was capable of, and the end result looks very confident.

I can't give five stars because, even though this held my attention better than some silent movies I've seen, the story still drags toward the end.  Scenes on board the pirate ship after the lost boys are captured are too long, there are too many awkward cuts, and what's with the American patriotism?  Sure, this movie was made by an American studio, but everybody knows it's based on a British play.  Hoisting the Stars and Stripes and singing ""America the Beautiful"" after a victory over the pirates ... this element seems misplaced.

All in all, this is a charming film, not perfect, but definitely worth checking out if you are a fan of Peter Pan or silent cinema.  An unjustly overlooked masterpiece.",1250726400,5,2491,4.619589977220957
1055955,5,6305620849,"There are only three reasons someone would be interested in this movie:
They are into Peter Pan,
they are Anna May Wong Fans, (such as I),
or they are into ""early"" cinema, (such as I).
The most valuable information a DVD review can offer is describing the image and sound quality.
I was prepared for a ton of compromises for this 1924 feature, and was very very pleasantly surprised.
What you will find throughout is exceptional image quality and a fine accompanying soundtrack.
I can only add, for fans of Anna May Wong, that you will see  a total of about 1 minute of Anna May Wong at a very young age, before her longer role in The Thief of Baghdad which was released in the following year.  As a fan, I am appreciative to have this very brief, but of exceptional image quality, rare sample of her early performances.",1235433600,3,820,4.46

Here is yet another video/DVD version of PETER PAN (others include the ""Disney"" version, the Mary Martin TV version, Cathy Rigby's A & E Broadcast, Speilberg's HOOK, and soon Disney's RETURN TO NEVERLAND) that should be of interest to both fans of Peter Pan and classic film buffs. It is fully restored from the archival 35mm hand-tinted elements (thought to be lost forever) of the 1924 silent film. This ""first"" film version based on the Sir James M. Barrie's extremely popular play stars Betty Bronson, who was hand-picked by the author himself. Both the video and the DVD include a fully-orchestrated score, and the DVD has some very interesting bonuses for Peter Pan enthusiasts, i.e. publicity photos and art, cast member interview, etc.. Probably closest to the original New York stage production starring Maude Adams, the film goes above and beyond with cinematic effects that were, and still are, a marvel to behold for a film produced in '20s. This is a Peter Pan of both literary and historical importance. With a new $100 million Sony Pictures/Disney joint production (P J Hogan directing) to begin soon, this classic gem should add to the ""Pan-demonium""! Incidentally the original written work by Sir James M. Barrie will be celebrating it's centennial soon, and his life will be commemorated with yet another film starring Johnny Depp as the author.",1234396800,2,1418,5.034042553191489
1055957,4,6305620849,"Peter Pan is a classic story that never gets old. Children love the idea of being able to fly to a wonderful place of fun and imagination, and adults love to go back to a time when they felt the same way.

As always, Peter Pan is played by a woman, this time she is Betty Bronson. Although hardly a recognizable name today, Bronson worked very hard to win the role over the top names of the day. Alongside her are actresses Esther Ralston as Mrs. Darling, Mary Brian as Wendy, and Anna Mae Wong as Tiger Lily. Ernest Torrence makes a great Captain Hook, though one might not expect him to.

The only strange thing about this film is that all of the animals are played by people in fuzzy suits. There is a dog, a crocodile, and wolves played by people. The special effects are pretty good; the flying children look good for the time period and Tinker Bell is done very well. However, sometimes it is obvious that people and objects are being pulled by strings, and there is a major error in the beginning. When Peter Pan is trying to stick his shadow back on, the light in the room casts a real shadow onto the floor.

All of these things aside, this is a really entertaining film. The sequences in Neverland seem very short because they are so fun, and the story really pulls at your heartstrings. The central theme of family is very prevalant.",1154563200,5,1344,4.368
1055958,4,6305620849,"I recently bought this movie because I'm a huge fan of Peter Pan and I was curious to see this 20s rendition of the lovely story. Though I wasn't expecting much, it was very accurate to the story. A very good movie, but I was a little disappointed at how they made the Darling children into patriotic Americans. Sure that would have been fine had they really been American..but no... Yeah the patriotism was borderline cheesy. But I guess we can't win all the time. If you can get past that, it's an amazing movie. Betty Bronson did a good job at the boy who never grows up, very cute. I'd recommend it for anyone who likes Peter Pan or old movies (or both for that matter).",1073433600,11,674,4.31496062992126

1055960,4,6305620849,"When I showed this to my friends, (none of whom are silent-movie addicts) the comment was unanimous: LOVELY! These are guys who normally watch Men in Black and Armageddon for kicks.
But how true it is: Peter Pan is a lovely picture. Or rather, a picture-play, with the stress on play. There are rather few set-ups: The children's bedroom, the forest, the underground cave and the pirate boat. The linking sequences are very short. You can imagine this has been lifted more or less intact from the theatre, with a few extras, such as the mermaids on the beach and the flying-sequences.

Herbert Brenon's direction is OK, though not very impressive. No matter. Once you get into the J.M. Barrie story, you are transported anyway. Like the foreword says: Every character in this play is a child, and you have to become a child to understand it.
Betty Bronsons balletic pantomime as Peter is enchanting, the Lost Boys are genuinely charming and the villains are deliciously stupid. When the end comes, you've had an experience worth having.
Technically, the film holds up well, the photography and lighting is sensitive and first-rate. The grey tones are velvety, and there are very few scratches. Excellent! The DVD-copy is struck from a marvellous print.
The new music score is in character and just right for a 1920's movie. The extras include a 35 minute interview with Esther Ralston, where she talks about her career and her part as Mrs. Darling in Peter Pan. There is some juicy stuff about Louis B. Mayer here!",1025827200,13,1514,4.823076923076923
1055961,5,6305620849,"I know that Betty Bronson is playing a boy in this film, but she is still as beautiful a silent actress as I have seen. It's a wonder that she did not really go on to greater things. All the more reason then to enjoy her performance in this film. It is delighful, subtle and strangely sexy especially with regard to her somewhat reluctant romance with Wendy. One has to accept from the beginning the conventions of this film. It is theatrical and thus a dog is obviously a man in a costume, a crododile is obviously fake etc. That is not to say however, that the special effects are primitive. The scenes of Peter and the children flying are as realistic as anything done with 'blue screen.' It is worthy of note that J.M. Barrie did not much care for this adaptation of his work. It is hard to see why, but perhaps one can conjecture that he did not much care for some of the added americanisms. Maybe he had a point. It does seem a little strange to see the lost boys running up the Stars and Stripes on the pirate flag pole. Nothing against Old Glory of course, but it's rather like seeing the Union Jack run up a flag pole in Little Women. Still this is a very minor point. Whatever Barrie may have thought, this is clearly the best adaptation of his play on film. The print, on the DVD, is as good as any silent film I have seen, it is clear and tinted in a subtle manner. The score is amusing and fits in well with the action. The DVD extras are welcome, especially a large photo gallery mainly featuring Bronson. In conclusion I would say that this is one of the very best silent films I have seen. It is hard to imagine that it could dissapoint silent film fans.",980035200,17,1670,4.238244514106583
1055962,5,6305620849,"This film is the unsung masterpiece of cinema, along with Harold Lloyd's KID BROTHER and a couple of others. Enchanting and ravishing in the most deepest meaning of these words. Though I cry easily, this one got me crying  all along - tears of joy. And there are no words to describe that kind of  tears. Kino's edition is a must and it should be in every collection. It  would even be better if this film was to be the first element of a new  collection - it has everything to make you want to see more things like  this. But I believe it's one of a kind.",951091200,21,556,4.111111111111111

Considering that for years, we have had nothing but  terrible bootleg copies of this film to judge it by, this is a wonderful  treat.  Thanks to KINO for making this film available.  The special effects  are pretty nice, too.  Try to remember when you watch it that it was made  way back in 1924.......and enjoy.....",946944000,10,539,4.698924731182796

7892525,5,6305620849,"The first thing you notice in the film is the credits. Among them is George Ali as Nana the dog. Then there is a reminder that this film is for the kid in all of us and that even the pirates are kids at heart.

As the scene opens up we see that this film is more of a stage play captured on film. Nana takes center stage and is so well portrayed that you have to remember it is a George in a fur suit. For people that do not know the story it is well played out and you find yourself actually anticipating the next sentence. For those that do know the story you are in for a few surprises. There are a few scenes of Neverland that look a tad like the California coast. The crocodile is cute.

Several things stand out in this film that you can not help but notice; among them are that it is Americanized to the point that when the pirate ship is taken the ""Jolly Roger"" is replaced with ""Old Glory"" instead of the ""Union Jack"". There seems to be lots of medicine handed out. And surprise, a brief request for audience (this means you) participation. Peter Pan traditionally is portrayed by a woman however Betty Bronson is a tad over developed for the part. Bronson is very convincing.

This is the story if a young lad that decides never to grow up. He is snooping around the Darling house and being spotted escapes with the exception of his shadow that got caught. On a return trip he convinces the Darling siblings to fly of to Neverland where they have many adventures with pirates, Indians and fairies. Will they also never grow up and what will the parents do?

All in all the film follows the story and you may find this to be one of if not your favorite version.",1503792000,,1670,4.209375

7892529,4,6305620849,"Really great telling of the Peter Pan play. The film is a silent classic from 1924---and filmed by a British company. Oddly enough, they changed all British references to American! Great portrayal of all the scenes we've come to love and expect. Captain Hook and the other pirates are perfect and quite comical. As is customary, Peter Pan is played by an older woman pretending to be a younger boy. Musical score is chipper and reflective of a silent score from the 1920's. Title cards are easy to read and keep the story line moving forward. Sometimes you can actually read the lips of the actors who are saying the actual words that are on the following title card! This was a last version of the film until Disney's animated version in 1950.",1404432000,,744,4.601503759398496
