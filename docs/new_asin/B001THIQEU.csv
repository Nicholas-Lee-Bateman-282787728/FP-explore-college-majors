3790632,5,B001THIQEU,"it really brought back memories from when I use to watch this show when I was younger, it was great then and still great.",1360195200,,121,4.083333333333333
3790633,5,B001THIQEU,I was watching this series on tbs on Sundays but I wanted to see it from the begining so I looked for it on site and I found it for a great price,1358726400,,145,3.4242424242424243
3790634,5,B001THIQEU,Both my husband & my myself enjoyed this video of the Second Season of The Jeff Foxworthy Show alot.  We were alittle surprised the entire Second Season was so different from the First Season but both Seasons were very funny.  Too bad the show ended after the Second Season - I think the way the Second Season last show finished it would have made a very interesting & enjoyable Third Season if the show had gotten that chance.  I would recommend this video of The Complete Second Season of The Jeff Foxworthy Show to anyone considering purchasing it.,1275264000,8,551,4.6020408163265305
3790635,1,B001THIQEU,"I bought this having been amused with season 1. Unfortunately, season 2 was just pathetic. There were so many holes it's not funny, and the recasting was just absolutely horrible. WHY anyone would like this show is beyond me.

Foxworthy, himself is great, and the only reason I don't fully regret purchasing this show, but the rest of this god aweful piece of trash is just horrible, unentertaining and wrong.",1263772800,3,409,4.8428571428571425
3790636,2,B001THIQEU,"I got this because I thought it would be a good comedy for a cheap price. I couldn't even watch two episodes, it wasn't really funny, it seemed like it was trying to hard to be a family comedy but fell flat. There is a reason you missed this on TV because it just isn't that good.

Watch Everybody Loves Raymond or The Cosby Show if you want to be entertained.",1252108800,2,360,4.070422535211268
3790637,3,B001THIQEU,"Unlike season one, there are a number of good episodes in this set: Wrestling Opera, Twister of Fate, and Field of Schemes to name a few.  The real charm of the show is getting to know Jeff's family and friends in his fictional hometown of Briarton, Georgia.  Among these are Jeff's dad, Big Jim played by G.W. Bailey, pal Bill Pelton played by fellow blue collar comedian Bill Engvall, and co-worker Florus Workman played by Neil Giuntoli.  But just like season one, the producers kept tweaking the show over and over again, especially with Jeff's boss (three of them in 23 episodes).

There are no extras, no commentaries, no subtitles.  Menus are the same as the season one set.",1242172800,5,681,4.689075630252101

3790640,4,B001THIQEU,"The second season of The Jeff Foxworthy Show is very funny.  They replaced most of the cast, but still had good writing.  I personally like season one better.  However, you should watch season two and judge it on it's own merit.",1388707200,,228,4.512195121951219

3790643,5,B001THIQEU,This has impacted me a lot. It has comedy and hilarious scenes in it. It's all about how Jeff made the show. He works for a trucking company that does  a lot of shipping. The shipper was very fast and prompt with the shipping. They gave me a tracking number for it and so I will order from them again. Cause this was a gift for my dad.,1378425600,,335,3.926470588235294
