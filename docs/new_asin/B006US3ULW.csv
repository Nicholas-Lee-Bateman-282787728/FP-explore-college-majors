8504677,5,B006US3ULW,"Ridiculously inspiring documentary about the coming together of a musical group formed by homeless street people, most of whom are older paraplegics, in the poverty ridden Congo.  They take in a young man with his home-made, one-stringed instrument as a sort of protg. They practice for years (the film was made over a 5 year period) before finally getting to play in Europe.  The music and performances are amazing, the people even more so.

Often I find warm your heart docs too sticky and manipulative.  But these brave and wonderful musicians earn every bit of our admiration, respect and joy.  We see the downs as well as the ups, and the film never short changes just how much work and luck have to come together for these artists to have any hope of success.

The film-makers make no pretense at staying removed and objective. They are just as won over, and in time actively become a part of trying to raise enough money to help these men live their dream, to record, and to travel with their music. (But in an understated way  this never feels like a film of self-aggrandizement).  A true triumph of the human spirit story, filed with smiles against all the overwhelming odds.",1426032000,2,1184,4.685990338164252

8504679,5,B006US3ULW,"If you love music and you love people, you'll adore this group of disabled, homeless, Congolese musicians who turn the cards they've been dealt into a winning hand.  You'll also want to pick up ""Bouger Le Monde,"" a CD of their triumphant European tour.
One of their songs (as explained on this DVD) is ""I sleep on cardboard.  One day I hope to have a mattress.""  Let's help them get one.",1378857600,3,387,4.422535211267606
8504680,4,B006US3ULW,"Benda Bilili - look beyond appearances; this is a street band from the Congo, who are given the chance to record their music and tour Europe. We see the musicians, 4 who are paraplegic and 3 others, who make music that gives them this success. However, since this was filmed in 2004 and it is now years later that this is released, it would be nice to have a follow up to tell what has happened to these men.

We do see an amazing acceptance of life. That is one of the amazing features of this film, not to mention their infectious music.
We see a group of men who know ""the wind can blow the other way"". It is a philosophy that is as good as their music is engaging. It's an interesting film not only for the music but to see the life these men live in the Democratic Republic of Congo - one that many should take note of. I just wish there was more of a follow-up from 2004 to 2010 when this program is dated.",1341273600,,912,4.066666666666666
8504681,4,B006US3ULW,This documentary is inspiring and entertaining.  My two youngest children (10 and 12) watched this with me.  It is a social eye-opener and the music is fantastic!  What a talented group.,1334880000,,186,4.935483870967742
