Filmed at the Colchester Conventions Centre in the UK -a place not other than a deconsecrated church- in 2007 with only 4 cameras that do an excellent job of superbly capturing the ultra-intense performance from a chick trio from Japan who play a weird mixture of doom metal and crust -let's just say they wear Celtic Frost an Amebix t-shirts, but the moniker is a tribute to their fav band, Hellhammer,gal.....hammer, get it ?

These girls really take their stage prescence and attitude very seriously, from the way they wear rigorous crust-black to the total abscense of eye contact -let alone any kind of interaction- with the audience down to the The Ring film-inspired makeup that make them look like zombies - but fails to make the bassist unnatractive....if you know what I mean.

The picture is a sharp widescreen, with awesome edition that shows everything OK except for the drummer that gets only frontal shots, esp. on the song in which she leads vocals -incredibly high pitched, highly counterpointing the rotten, deathy stlye of the other two gals. Drumming is a tad sloppy and I could have used louder snares in the mix, which, by the way, is incredibly good, so I'm not complaining. Guitar and bass use inhuman amounts of distortion and the open notes from the 4th string of the bass made the floor shake under my feet.

If you're into Amebix, Celtic Frost, Hellhammer, or even crust or black metal as I am, chances are you'll LOVE every one of the main feature's 47' .

Extras include a few tracks recorded in clubs in Oslo and somewhere else I can't recall, a couple of videoclips made by mixing studio songs with edited live footage, and a 17' interview with the band. A bit lacking ? You bet, but at realistic volume level you'll get the same tinnitus -and satisfaction-  I experienced.

Get this, you'll thank me later. Jap bands RULE !",1271894400,2,2046,4.6353591160221
