645384,5,6303451160,I saw this movie many years ago and enjoyed it very much. Today I have a younger son and would like for him to view the movie with me. As a result I found that there is a continuation which I would love to see. Return of  tommy tricker. But it's not available. How very sad. Great movie.,946425600,3,287,3.9482758620689653
645385,4,6303451160,"I just saw this movie for the first time the day after christmas, and I was half asleep then woke up to that weird song, but it was very catchy! The movie was surprisingly entertaining, to be of Canadian origin! Anyway,  too bad its not available on video, I would enjoy seeing the film in its  entirety!",946252800,,304,4.315789473684211
7846997,5,6303451160,Wow I finally got to see the end of the movie in my school when I was younger we could never see the end lol. The movie was in great condition can't wait to get more movies from amazon.com its so worth it!,1295049600,,205,3.7906976744186047
7846998,5,6303451160,This movie is wonderful. It makes me warm inside. The excitement I felt when I watched this movie was only rivalled by Liverpool's victory in the Champions League Semifinal.,1116115200,,173,5.0
7846999,4,6303451160,"I got this movie to see 14 year old Rufus Wainwright in it (who is great in it, in a small role as a singer), and the movie turned out to be absolutely adorable altogether. It's a bit too cheesy to really be enjoyable for adults, but my 11 year old brother watched it and loves it now. It's so much better than the overly stylized kid's movies that are being made these days - in this movie, the kids actually act like kids, not overly precocious mini-adults, and there isn't a product placement every 2 minutes. Overall, a really fun adventure movie for kids - highly recommended!",1101168000,,581,4.388888888888889
7847000,5,6303451160,"Without a doubt, one of the best Canadian movies I have ever seen. I first saw this film when I was about six, and have been hooked ever since. It's redeeming quality is phenomenal, and holds up well to repeated viewings, even fourteen years later!
Yes, it's cheesy, yes it's a childs film, and yes, it's Canadian. But of my childhood memories, this movie stands out (Canadian pun intended). It is unfortunate that the film is now out of print with no signs of a DVD version or re-release evident. I was lucky enough to snag a VHS from ebay for $15. Let's just hope the tape doesn't wear out anytime soon.

7847001,1,6303451160,"I cannot possibly have seen the same ""Tommy Tricker and the Stamp Traveller"" as the others who have reviewed this film here. I work at a television station and had to air this travesty repeatedly. I can't give specifics of why it was bad, but the whole idea, feel, everything was just horrible. It wasn't even good to make fun of. At least I got paid to watch it. Run from this film, and for the love of all that is good, do not subject your children to it. I have a good mind to call DFYS on some of these people.",1009929600,,514,4.049019607843137
7847002,4,6303451160,We borrowed this years ago from our local library and my son watched it several times... It started him on a stamp collecting hobby and an interest in learning more about the countries depicted on the film... I liked it because it is hard to find wholesome family films these days so it was a treat to see this movie!!! We are trying to get a copy of it now!,998784000,5,358,4.128571428571429
7847003,4,6303451160,"I give Tommy Tricker a thumbs up.
It is a movie starring kids meant for kids.  If you are looking for some sort of ""inner meaning"" don't bother watching it.  If you are kid who wants to enjoy a fun movie see it.
SPECIAL NOTE:  Up and coming rock singer Rufus Wainwright has a cameo appearance.  He is credited as the ""Singing Boy.""",996796800,4,331,4.2063492063492065

7847005,5,6303451160,"Oh the memory of watching this movie in my grade 7 class.  I've never forgotten the kids running through the mall with (a then unknown) Rufus Wainwright singing that song in a mall talent contest (or something like that).  I still remember every word of that song.  It's funny how some things you just remember for years and years after.  I would love for my kids to remember just as many parts of the movie as I do.  I can guarantee the minute it comes out on video, I'll have a copy.",971913600,3,485,4.228260869565218
7847006,5,6303451160,"This is only one of a long list of very original films produced by the Qu&eacute;bec film-maker Roch Demers, and known as the ""Tales for Everyone"" series (originally produced in French as the ""Contes  pour tous"" series). What a shame that they are not all readily  available in English. Like the ""Stamp Traveller,"" these films all  rely on a high degree of imagination and are full of childish high spirits  and fun.
In this film, which puts the hobby of stamp collecting in the  foreground and then leads us on a merry dance to China and Australia, via  the post, the spirit of adventure and inquiry is never far away. Using  childhood models that we all know about, but which are nevertheless  realistically portrayed in spite of the obvious associated cliches, the  film challenges us to see the world in knew ways. Not only magic and  mystery are present, but the adult world of intrigue and, to some extent,  dishonesty, are included in a plot which is not afraid to examine people's  motives.
This is Demers's strength: to show us the spirit that exists in  the child and contrast it with the sometimes crass behaviour of adults who  have perhaps grown too old too fast. He is asking us all to look at the  world through the child's eyes and goodness knows, if his films can be  believed (and believe me, they can!), then we need to start taking a second  look right away. Find it if you can - it's around, as is the sequel and one  or two others in the series. Those who have access to the French series  will find they number something like 18 films by now, most of which I would  classify in the same class as this one: well worth watching.",956880000,,1649,4.469798657718121
