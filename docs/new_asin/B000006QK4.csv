7904986,4,B000006QK4,"I liked watching this video. But Nat King Cole had an amazing life and as the reviewer said, his whole story just could not be told in 50 minutes. It  does cover the highlights and tragedies of Cole's career, but doesn't really have the  time to elaborate on them. But it is a nice tribute to the late  singer/musician/composer. It features interviews with Maria Cole, Nat's  widow; daughter singer Natalie Cole; his friends, and business associates.  A couple of other things about this video that Amazon didn't get right: Nat Cole was 45 when he died, NOT 47 (he was born in 1919) and the date of this video is 1997, not 1987, as Amazon.com  has listed here, so it is rather recent. A better video is the UNFORGETTABLE  documentary from 1988, but if you don't want to spend a lot of money, this  video will suit just fine.",966124800,5,824,4.483221476510067
