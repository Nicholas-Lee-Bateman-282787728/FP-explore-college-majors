8591894,4,B00DCLT9X8,"Several chapters from this DVD have been excerpted and shared online. Some of those chapters don't seem to work as comedy very well. My initial impression was ""more angry than funny"". However, I bought the DVD out of my sheer fandom of Dave Foley, and when I watched the whole thing, I had a much better experience than watching clips online. If you liked Dave Foley in Kids in the Hall, or NewsRadio, this DVD deserves a place on your shelf, and you should set aside the time to watch the whole thing at once. It's much better than the freely-available clips would indicate. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is simply because it's not the sort of thing you'd want to watch VERY often, but I am sure I will watch it several more times in the future, and I'll always be glad I own it.",1430265600,,803,4.2894736842105265
