8744048,1,B0195N4K6W,Complete crap. At least i only had to waste 15 minutes on it. Wish i wouldn't have wasted my money. CRAP!,1492387200,,105,4.0476190476190474
8744049,5,B0195N4K6W,"Very well done Thriller. The photography is great, the actors did an amazing job, especially Stephen Cardwell who plays Charles Manson and the actress playing the mother. The music is also amazing, very creepy. I love what they did with the sound tracks and the pictures, very creative.",1450137600,,286,4.979166666666667
8744050,5,B0195N4K6W,"You will never see Charles Manson like in this movie! What a clever plot! Charles Manson will get face to face with Roman Polanski for the first time ever (they never even met in real life!) and Polanski find the perfect way to pay him back for destroying his family.
Must Watch!",1449705600,,279,4.384615384615385
8744051,5,B0195N4K6W,"Great movie! The story, the performance of ""Charlie"", the photography, the soundtrack,...It is also very controversial. The movie is only 15 minutes, but the special contents are really cool and interesting, they will keep you busy for a while. There is also a documentary of the behind the scenes with interviews to cast and crew.",1449705600,,331,5.036363636363636
