8260089,5,B0015VMZ2E,"Tony has a great range. His deep understanding of the human condition is understood in the toss of his wild black mane. His acting skill is displayed in the perfect pitch of the jealousy he displays for the young woman and his fawning for Tom Mix's caress. The poster for the ""Just Tony"" moving picture without Tony's image is a travesty. Another issue is the total lack of dialog by Tony. An obvious oversight. Several existential questions have been raised by Tony. Like, was there a hint of racism displayed in the death of the inhuman character Manual Cordova and what is the true nature of the relationship between Tony, Tom Mix and the young girl. As for Tom Mix, a twenty gallon hat and a five gallon performance. Tony owns this movie.",1393891200,,742,4.586466165413534

8260091,4,B0015VMZ2E,"It all began with the legendary Tom Mix, the yardstick by which all B-Western stars are measured.

Born in 1880, Mix had worked with the Texas Rangers, had been a bartender, a sheriff, and a champion rodeo rider in his Wild West Show. Hollywood had a bona fide true blue western legend.  After becoming THE cowboy movie star at the age of 30, the extremely prolific Mix worked and played equally hard, developing a love for fast cars, fast women (married five times), and reckless spending.

Most of his 20's westerns were adapted from Zane Grey novels and were high quality entertainment for the masses.  Mix often wrote, produced and directed in addition to acting.  He was the polar opposite to William S. Hart's dusty realism.  Mix combined humor, increased action which featured his own stunt work, a star horse named Tony, flashy showmanship and enthusiastic energy in his films.

When his stardom naturally began to dim in the 1930's, mainly due to age, he toured with his beloved Tom Mix Circus before an untimely high speed auto accident and a flying metal suitcase to the back of the head on an Arizona highway put an end to all the Circus in 1940, but not to the legend. For ten years after his death, the Tom Mix Radio Show continued on with immense popularity.

Tom Mix comic books were also extremely popular for several decades, as was the touring Tom Mix festival which finally ran down (but not entirely out) in the mid 90's.  Since most of his films are silent, few today have even seen a Tom Mix film, and his reputation by far exceeds the actual films.

The Sinister Cinema presentation of ""Just Tony"" begins, aptly enough, with a trailer.  ""Hit the Trail!  The Gun Ranger  is out to clean up the town!  Bob Steel, two-gun deputy whose twitching fingers itch for fights!  Outlaws Rustlers Cowboys Posses and Bob Steel as the Gun Ranger!  A Republic Release.""  This trailer promises white hat cow dude Steel kicking black hat bad guy butt, a mix of masked bandits, pencil-thin mustached villains and a pretty girl exclaiming ""Oh, Dan!""

Tom has his eyes on the beautiful black wild stallion, Tony, that he wants to tame, but first things first as he has a score to settle with the SOB J.P. Lockney who shot him in the leg a few years before for playing his banjo in the middle of a card game at a bar.  Unknown to Tom, Lockney's gang has rounded up a bunch of wild horses, including Tony, who is being abused by one of Lockney's scumbag men.  Tom finds Tony being abused, saves him from the lash, and turns the whip on the low life.

Tony actually has a role here other than merely being Tom's horse.  Tom is the first human who has treated Tony well, and the expected bond between man and horse has begun.  All of this is witnessed by Lockney's daughter, Marianne Jordan, who immediately falls in love with Tom from a distance.  Tom finds that Tony has been entered in a local rodeo horse race and that Lockney has bet against his own horse.  Tom does not take to this bit of double crossing Tony and sees to it that Tony wins.

Winning the race only brings Tony more grief and, after another whipping, Tony tramples his tormentor and escapes to the hillside, rejoining what remains of his former herd.  Tony plots his revenge against man and frees the captive horses at Lockney's ranch (1920s audiences hardly subscribed to our realism fetish).  Lockney and his men declare war on this horse from hell.  Marianne calls on Tom to set things right and, of course, you can be assured he will indeed, but not until he has to deal with a conspiracy by Lockney's men to stop him.  Tom is ordered to go and answers, ""Maybe I will, but likely I won't.""  After that bit of business  and some derring-do, Tom captures Tony, tames him,  and cements the bond between man and horse.

Tom, Lockney, his men and Marianne all find out that Lockney is the man that Tom has sworn revenge against.  More action packed escapades follow.  Tom is kidnapped  and beaten.  Marianne saves Tom, then Tony saves them both from Lockney's gang . In the end, Tom forgives Lockney, Tony forgives mankind and the three walk off into the sunset together.  ""Just Tony"" is well paced, charming and a great balance between story and action.  It's easy to see why 1920's kids ate this stuff up.

8260092,3,B0015VMZ2E,"The name of one of early cinema's greatest Western stars, Tom Mix, led me to buy this DVD because although he starred in around 300 silent films, and wrote, directed and produced another 50 to 100 films, he is seldom seen these days.  Not only was he a huge name in films alongside other legendary Western stars like William S. Hart, Mix also made his mark as a true cowboy in Wild West shows, performing his riding and shooting skills on and off screen.  But as soon as ""Just Tony"" began, I barely even noticed the famous Tom Mix because his horse completely steals the show!  This 1922 silent film is the first of 30 other films which stars this astonishing animal actor called Tony, and now I know why he was labelled ""the Wonder Horse"".  All the exciting action scenes performed by Tony look very realistic and natural, especially a rather shocking and disturbing scene in which Tony, playing a wild horse, tramples to death the man who treated him cruelly.  Tom Mix plays the good-hearted man who loves Tony's wild spirit and sets out to win him over with love and respect instead, and at the same time, of course, win the heart of a certain girl who turns out to be the daughter of the man he has been seeking to exact revenge for a bar shooting.  What might be a good story with some depth and interesting plot is given superficial treatment to the point that there seem to be gaps and big leaps in the storyline.  This is not helped by intertitles which are a strain to read because the light and dark contrasts are quite faded in places and the writing almost disappears into the background.  They are still legible, however, and the overall picture quality, apart from general fading, is still good and quite clear without any scratches, snowflakes or other signs of deterioration.  This print appears to be from the Paul Killiam collection and has an old-sounding orchestral musical score which more or less suits the action in the film.  The few negative aspects of this film can be overlooked because Tony the Wonder Horse is such a captivating star in his own right, and a few stunts and scenes together with Tom Mix also stand out as raw and authentic Western action rarely seen in modern films.  No doubt Tony was an animal star on the same level as Rin Tin Tin who also amazed and impressed audiences in the 1920s, but this film is all about what its title says: `Just Tony'.",1222387200,6,2392,4.513888888888889
