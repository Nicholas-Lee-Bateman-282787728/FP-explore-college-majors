5837357,5,B00DNLZNH8,"What a great value. 3 of my favorite Christmas movies in one DVD collection. Some of the movies are out of print and some were never released on DVD until now. The savings are incredible. I love this new idea of combining movies for a much cheaper price. A big thanks to whoever came up with this idea. At last, quality at a tremendously low price!",1384560000,14,348,4.287878787878788
5837358,4,B00DNLZNH8,"I bought this specifically for Mrs. Santa Claus. I was a little disappointed they were not each on their own CD. But, the movie is there in its entirety, so it will be fine.",1384300800,21,173,4.117647058823529

5837361,5,B00DNLZNH8,"""The Christmas Box"" Hallmark Movie alone is worth the price for this timeless collection because it expresses what Christmas is all about.  What was the first gift of Christmas?  Watch ""The Christmas Box"" and find out.

This movie was heartwarming and thought provoking.  Our time on this third rock from a medium star is short.  Life is precious and not about getting more ""stuff"" but sharing time with those we love.",1383436800,23,418,4.830985915492958

5837425,2,B00DNLZNH8,I would love to order it. I love two in it are Night they Saved Christmas and Mrs. Santa Claus. But there is a problem - no closed captioned.

It's one of the favorite Christmas movies and holds a lot of childhood memories, and I fear the VHS won't last forever. I've looked for years to find the DVD version, but always struck out. I was ecstatic to find this collection. And it was an added bonus to see that it included another favorite, ""The Christmas Box.""

5837554,2,B00DNLZNH8,"The case is lined with a fake velvety material; it leaves fibers all over the discs so the need to be wiped off before every time played. There are 3 movies on two discs, and you can only start a movie from the beginning, there is no scene selection. First time played, it skipped several times. Only reason I give two stars is because the movies are good.",1419465600,2,356,4.25

5837573,5,B00DNLZNH8,"Absolutely love this Classic Christmas set, the pricing is pretty good for 6 Christmas films that are not only classic but hard to find as well..With such holiday gems as the 1996 musical film Mrs. Santa Claus with the legendary Angela Lansbury & the 1984 adventure The Night They Saved Christmas with everyone's favorite ""angel"" Jaclyn Smith alongside Art Carney & Paul Le Mat. The great thing about this set is being able to have all of these heartwarming family friendly films in 2 discs with 3 films on each disc. The con being there are no special features or trailers included but for the great price & the fact that all of these hard to find movies are in one set makes it worth while. Besides the films listed above the set includes :
An Old Fashioned Christmas starring Jacqueline Bisset, One Christmas with Henry Winkler & Katherine Hepburn, A Christmas Visitor with Meredith Baxter & The Christmas Box starring Richard Thomas. This is one set that will not disappoint filled with laughs, a few tears and lots of Christmas fun for the entire family.",1417824000,5,1059,4.698924731182796
5837574,5,B00DNLZNH8,I was looking for a dvd of The Christmas Box with Richard Thomas and Maureen O'Hara.  I found it in this collection for Christmas.  6 very different movies to watch - I loved them all.  From Angela Lansbury as a musical Mrs Claus to a Christmas Visitor with William Devane to an Old Fashioned Christmas to a Truman Capote short story to Art Carney as Santa.  It's a good variety for Christmas.,1417651200,,393,4.416666666666667
5837575,1,B00DNLZNH8,"Wow is this bad!  The Christmas box is okay - Mrs. Santa Claus has its moments (love the big production numbers of song and dance choreography) but the rest - especially ""The Night They Saved Christmas"" really - well frankly Stink.  The acting is bad - yes even Charlie's Angel  Jaclyn Smith - the plot is weak, the dialog is blah-humbug and the expressions, smiling et. al. are forced and scary.

I love any kind of Christmas movie that takes place at the North Pole! I guess I'm just a kid at heart. I don't think that Mrs. Santa Claus has been on TV since it originally aired. If it has, I don't remember. Any time I can add a good deal to my Christmas DVD collection, I do it. I just bought this last month for 17.98. Great deal!",1414713600,,464,4.0

All 6 movies however are very good. The only concern I find is these 6 movies are on 3 Dvd's and they rest on a felt cardboard holder. I would have thought that if they wanted just to conserve space and better protection they could have done better if the used a regular dvd case and put 2 movies on each dvd, then use the plastic dvd holder the can hold 2 dvd's that snaps the the inner spine, and the third dvd could be on the rear cover as all dvd come. Otherwise this collection will last ok. Each movie is watchable, could have had a better touch had they took the time to really care to painstakenly made sure these were rekeased in pristine quality. They are however much better than the Best VHS video tape releases.",1409270400,,888,4.381818181818182

5837610,5,B00DNLZNH8,Finally after many years of searching Mrs. Santa Claus with Angela Lansbury has been reissued.  This is a great value with six Christmas classics issued for one low price.,1388707200,,171,4.896551724137931
5837611,5,B00DNLZNH8,I really only ordered this for the Night they saved Christmas. It was a childhood favorite. Pretty stoked about it!,1388620800,,115,4.8
5837612,4,B00DNLZNH8,"First American system DVD we found for ""The night they saved Christmas"" and haven't wathed the other ones unfamiliar to us. The one we wanter played better than our worn VHS copy.",1388534400,,179,4.625
5837613,5,B00DNLZNH8,I'd been wanting The Night They Saved Christmas on DVD for some time but hadn't been able to find it until I came across this combo. It was actually cheaper than buying the movie I wanted by itself. If you haven't seen The Night They Saved Christmas you really should check it out. Art Carney as Santa Claus is wonderful. And Paul Williams plays Santa's chief elf. Great Christmas flick!,1388448000,,387,4.542857142857143
5837614,3,B00DNLZNH8,The movies were excellent. The tin case that has one dvd sitting on top of the other one was not. The tin was bad enough but why not at least have the discs in some kind of holder? Odd,1388275200,,184,3.7435897435897436
5837615,5,B00DNLZNH8,One of my favourite movies included (The Night They Saved Christmas) which has been difficult to find on DVD and many other wonderful heartwarming movies for the season.,1388102400,,169,5.071428571428571
5837636,4,B00DNLZNH8,"I loved ""An Old Fashioned Christmas"", ""A Christmas Visitor and ""The Christmas Box"".  Mrs. Claus was a musical, love Angela
Landsbury, hate musicals. ""The night they saved Christmas"" was ""awful""  And ""One Christmas"" was even worse!  So I liked
three out of six, good price so it was worth it!!",1388016000,,292,4.8
5837637,5,B00DNLZNH8,I originally bought this because of just one of the movies. This was the only way I could find it. After watching that one movie we watched the rest. All were very good! It came in perfect condition.,1388016000,,199,4.2631578947368425
5837638,5,B00DNLZNH8,Love all the movies in this set.  Great for the whole family.  Mrs Santa Claus is one of my favorites.,1387843200,,102,4.05
5837639,5,B00DNLZNH8,I love this set!!  I had been trying to find The Christmas Box & The Night They Saved Christmas on DVD for some time; so was delighted that these 2 were part of the collection!  The other titles were just a bonus!,1387756800,,213,4.0476190476190474
5837640,5,B00DNLZNH8,"We have been looking for ""Mrs. Santa Claus"" to purchase for years and finally found this package deal.  We are thrilled to now own ""Mrs. Santa Claus"" and have enjoyed a couple of the others from this collection.",1387756800,,211,4.552631578947368
5837641,3,B00DNLZNH8,"I bought it for ""The Night they Saved Christmas"" but it was darker than the VHS which I also have.
But still worth it.",1387411200,10,118,3.9583333333333335
5837642,5,B00DNLZNH8,What a great collection of little known classic Christmas stories! They truly depict the true meaning of Christmas. A great package well worth the money.,1387411200,,153,5.16
5837643,5,B00DNLZNH8,I ordered specifically for Mrs Santa Claus; however loved them all! Good quality transfer. So happy to find on DVD,1387238400,,114,4.75
5837644,5,B00DNLZNH8,"Wonderful movies of Christmases gone by!  Just like we remembered the ones when we were children growing up with parents who gave us their best in the hardest of times, these movies proved to be full of warmth and love bringing back the best!",1386979200,,242,4.5
5837645,5,B00DNLZNH8,All the movies on it - they are great family movies and movies a good friend of mine likes. I thought it would be a good Christmas gift.,1386633600,,136,3.892857142857143
5837656,5,B00DNLZNH8,I love this set!  I have been looking for these movies for over 10 years and have not been able to find them anywhere.  My favorite is the night they saved Christmas and I was only able to find it for purchase on amazon.  Thank you so much!  It is in perfect condition and I will treasure it always!!!,1386547200,,301,4.0508474576271185
5837657,4,B00DNLZNH8,"I gave this a 4 star rating simply because I'm not much for musicals which Mrs. Santa Claus was. Although it had a very good story line there was too much character singing. Overall the rest of the movies, a couple we'd seen before, were great. I must add the quality of the videos is much better than I expected.",1386547200,,313,4.233333333333333
5837658,5,B00DNLZNH8,I bought this originally because it had a Christmas classic that I had been searching for years to find on DVD Mrs. Claus with Angela Lansbury.  It also had on it Night They Saved Christmas which is another movie I thought I'd never be able to find on DVD.  Was very happy with this purchase just because of those two but each of the other 4 Christmas movies also are a wonderful addition to any collection.,1386460800,,407,4.342105263157895
5837659,5,B00DNLZNH8,I bought this for Mrs. Santa and enjoyed all of the movies.  It will be a Christmas favorite at our house.,1386201600,,106,4.0476190476190474
5837660,5,B00DNLZNH8,"finally two of my favorite Christmas movies are available on dvd!! Mrs. Santa Claus and The night they saved Christmas, are family favorites, that we haven't been able to watch for a few years after we lost the VHS tapes in a fire. SO happy to have these special stories to watch again!",1386201600,,286,4.415094339622642
5837661,4,B00DNLZNH8,"I think four stars is fair for this d.v.d.  The first story an old fashioned christmas is confusing and to be honest i still have no idear what it was about.  Mrs santa claus is not bad, if you like angela lansbury and corney singing.  one christmas is ho hum wake me up when its over.  I have to admit disk 2 is much better,  the night they saved christmas is really good children will like this one,  a christmas visitor is really good but does bring you down at times its a bit sad in places,  and last the christmas box is really really good they saved the best till last,  maureen o hara stars in this and you may be shocked how she looks very old and tired looking but still puts on an incredible performance, still the red headed spitfire.  This d.v.d set comes in a tin so thats different, should it be in your collection?  i think so ,you may not like all the movies like i said disk 2 is better but thats my opinion lol.",1386028800,,930,4.088397790055248
5837662,5,B00DNLZNH8,"I bought this 2 CD set mostly for 'The Christmas Box' starring Richard Thomas and Maureen O'Hara. It is one of my favorites and it is hard to find.  'The Christmas Visitor' is a very heartwarming movie as well.  I still have to watch the other 4 movies, but I'm sure I will enjoy them.  Another plus is the nice keepsake tin.",1385942400,,325,4.209677419354839
5837663,5,B00DNLZNH8,The stories all were very good.  I really liked mrs. Santa Claus.  Great music and dance numbers.  These stories can be enjoyed by all.,1385942400,,135,4.541666666666667
5837664,5,B00DNLZNH8,"One movie is a musical and hard to follow but the other movies are not too bad. I am watching the last of the set now and while the set was not quite what I expected, they are decent family movies. This review has been edited by myself because I based the set on the first two movies I watched and they were really the only two movies I personally did not like. The set comes in a nice Christmas tin. The movies are clear and they are enjoyable as far as no glitches in the DVDs themselves. One thing I prefer in my DVDs is the chapters and these do not have the chapter ability and need to be fast forwarded if you have to shut it down for a reason. Really they are not bad at all.",1385251200,,682,3.9136690647482015
5837665,5,B00DNLZNH8,This is worth the price just to get 2 of the movies that you cant get anywhere else the night they saved Christmas and the Christmas box plus you get 4 other good movies I have been trying to find both of those movies and could only find the Christmas box and the cheapest I seen it was 29.99 and that's for just one movie so this is a great deal,1384732800,,346,3.887323943661972
