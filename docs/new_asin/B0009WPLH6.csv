8068782,2,B0009WPLH6,"Plus - You get 12 movies cheap (especially if you get is second hand for $2-3)

Minus - Many VHS rips, especially of public domain movies so quality varies from poor to average. Several movies were shot in widescreen but are presented here in pan & scan (funny, just like a VHS!). Several italian movies with english dubbing the only option (original italian audio not included).  At least one movie (House on Haunted Hill 1959) is available in a remastered print from Warner Brothers which is far superior to the pan scan public domain version presented in this collection. Several of these movies have been released under other cheapo titles including Brentwoods Blood Bath sets.

I guess it's a cheap way to store some old movies as some will probably never be remastered but otherwise do some digging on the net.",1426809600,,816,4.773049645390071
8068783,4,B0009WPLH6,"Should probably say first off I'm really into low budget horror from the 70's and 80's, and there are some great rare ones on this set. Pieces is one of my all time favorites, a great college campus slasher from 1982. Birds of Prey I had never seen before, but has a big reputation as one of the ""worst movies ever made"" or something, but I call that hogwash this thing was great, by all rights it should have been called ""Attack of the Pigeons"" and anyone in P.E.T.A. should go nowhere near this flick, it's basically people of camera throwing pigeons at the actors, but it looks to have had a pretty big budget for a film like this, the gore was pretty good, and I found it hugely entertaining. Satan's School For Girls stars Kate Jackson and Cheryl Ladd, it's a made for tv movie from 1973 about cult killings in a girls boarding school, I like this one too. Little Corey Gorey I watched for the first time last night and loved it, it's a no budget Canadian film from 93, but it looks more like 83, this abused high school kid ties his overweight mother to a couch and goes on an unintentional killing spree to try to win over the girl of his dreams, fantastic flick. Slashdance was not as good, super cheesy, super low budget shot on camcorder movie about a bad ass female cop, didn't like it, but it had a few funny moments. Kill, Baby, Kill is pretty good gothic horror 1968. House on Haunted Hill, classic 1958 Vincent Price. I haven't watched the rest yet, not sure when I'll get to them, but this set is a steal as far as I'm concerned, and each film claims 1 side of a disk, not several jammed on each disk, making the quality more then adequate, while not remastered, or reference copy's I'm very pleased with this value set.",1354752000,,1736,4.328220858895706
8068784,3,B0009WPLH6,"A featured performer on two titles here is Enrica Bianchi Colombatto (better known as 'Erika Blanc'). Her Italian-made horror films from the 1960s and '70s are still highly regarded by fans. Another highlight brings together Cheryl Ladd and Kate Jackson several years before their CHARLIE'S ANGELS days. Vincent Price adds his inimitable talents as well.

""The Devil's Nightmare"" and ""Kill, Baby... Kill"" are the Ericka Blanc offerings. In the first, a group of tourists spend a frightful night in a haunted castle, while the second has murder victims turning up with gold coins embedded in their hearts.

A young woman investigates her sister's supposed suicide at ""Satan's School For Girls."" With Jackson and Ladd.

In ""House on Haunted Hill,"" millionaire playboy Prce invites five guests to spend the night at a haunted house. The bait: a $30,000 cash prize.
