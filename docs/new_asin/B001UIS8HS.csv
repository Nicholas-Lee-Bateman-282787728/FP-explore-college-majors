It was as if they were in the same room with the puppies playing with them.  I actually wept watching them have such a good time!  No blank, zombie TV stares, they were completely engaged!",1257379200,,311,4.327586206896552
8445058,5,B001UIS8HS,"I have blogged about maternity related products and was asked to give my opinion on AdoraPet Puppies video. The video details mentions for all ages. With 4 enthusiastic kids (9,7,5 and 15 months) ready to try this out with me. The music is very relaxing. It features 4 adorable puppies; hence the name AdoraPet Puppies. My older kids were waiting for something to happen as they watched the puppies play by themselves or all together. This reminds me alot of the Einstein videos. My 15 month old LOVED it! He pointed at the screen, clapped his hands together in excitement. The funniest was to watch him jump up and down in his spider man chair as he watched then jump up and dance. It was so nice to see a smile on his face as he watched.

I would recommend this for small children. My 5,7 and 9 year old lost interest after a few minutes.",1251849600,2,840,4.384615384615385

What better way to calm your child or settle down after a long day, then by watching adorable puppies playing together to beautiful music?

We recently received a DVD called ""AdoraPet Puppies"" from a company called AdoraPet. At first, I was confused about what it was all about? A video with just puppies, being puppies, set to music for a full 40 minutes? Ummmm...okay? But seriously, my kids loved it (and truthfully, I did too)! Especially our baby.

This video is so cute, you will catch yourself ""Ooooing and Awwwing"" and even giggling to yourself, as you watch these adorable pets play and be puppies. Definitely a DVD that dog lovers, children & even senior citizens would enjoy watching. I can see my Grandparents sitting and watching this video over and over again because it's so darn cute & stimulating!
Head over to [...] (their new website) and purchase a video for you, a loved one or senior citizen in your life today! Whoever receives these DVD's are going to fall in love with AdoraPets too!",1251244800,,1406,6.131979695431472
8445060,5,B001UIS8HS,"I bought this for my niece who loves dogs.  Whenever I babysit, she always asks me to put in this video. The video is AMAZING -- there's a puggle, dachshund aka ""weiner dog"", bulldog, cavamalt and terrier that play onscreen.

She can sit for hours just mesmerized by the puppies playing onscreen.

I highly recommend for anyone who has kids or anyone who loves pets!",1250121600,,366,4.6
