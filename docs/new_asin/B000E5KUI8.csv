8106118,2,B000E5KUI8,"Years ago, some witch lived in an apartment.  She killed 20 guys, drained their blood and then bathed in it.  Her sister was supposed to do something to complete the ritual and grant her immortality (or something), but she took off before the ceremony was over and the witch died.  So now some new people move into the apartment.  They have some friends over for a housewarming party, but of course the spirit of the witch comes back and takes over their bodies.  It jumps from body to body, so there's a ton of time spent trying to figure out who it's in.  this is used for some marginally interesting scenes where it turns out that the spirit wasn't in the body you thought it was.

Overall, this is just zero budget junk.  I've seen worse, but this is awfully bad.  Acting is adequate (and that's being extremely charitable), however the characters are so sedate that it's very difficult to keep from nodding off.  The whole film is very grainy.  There's not a hint of atmosphere, you certainly don't care bout any of these characters, and the plot moves along at a glacial pace.  There's very little theme music, and when you do actually get some, it might just be a single note held for an entire minute.  The movie is dreadfully boring.  It finally picks up a bit at the end, but that's certainly not to suggest that it gets exciting - just slightly less boring.  You get to see a couple of girls in their bras, and they're quite nice to look at.  That's about all this thing has to offer.

I imagine that the artwork on the box probably cost as much as the whole movie.",1222905600,,1576,4.397923875432526
8106119,3,B000E5KUI8,"This was called the LICH in pre-production as explained by Wikipedia: In the Dungeons & Dragons game, and in many works of fantasy fiction that draw upon Dungeons & Dragons for inspiration, a lich is a spellcaster who seeks to defy death by magical means. Liches convert themselves into an undead state by means of black magic and necromancy.

As a consequence, the only permanent way to kill a lich is to destroy its phylactery; otherwise, it will be able to recreate a new body for itself. Occasionally, this metamorphosis occurs by accident as a result of life-prolonging magic. A lich retains the abilities that it possessed in life, but it has a virtual eternity to hone its skills and inevitably becomes quite powerful.

Liches are usually among the most powerful undead creatures in almost any setting in which they appear, and are one of the most powerful non-unique undead creatures in the Dungeons & Dragons game.

If a lich exists long enough it becomes a demilich. The demilich's interest turns away from the physical realm, instead using astral projection to travel across other planes of existence. The magics preserving the demilich's body against the ravages of time weaken, usually causing the body to gradually deteriorate until only a skull or even a single skeletal hand remains.

The character of Lord Voldemort in the Harry Potter series stores fragments of his soul in a very lich-like manner; evidence from Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince spells this out. Whether or not he actually qualifies as a lich is a subject of debate, as his body is living, not undead.

Skeletor(Masters Of The Universe) may be considered a lich, because he possesses a skullike face and magical abilities. Since he was mortally wounded and then immediately brought from the brink of death and transformed by dark magic, he may qualify as undead and uninterred.

Or...What about Denzel Washington in FALLEN,Where he witnesses the serial killer dying and the pure evil of Serial killer jumps from one host to another.

Let's not throw a way the fact that director & writer Billy Parrish resembles Brandon Lee A LOT !

So,I've compared Resident Demon to D & D,Harry Potter ,Denzel and Masters of the Universe-Okay,skeptic.",1139011200,,2227,4.967741935483871
