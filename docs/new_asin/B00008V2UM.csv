1862282,3,B00008V2UM,"I must say that I am slightly disappointed at this series. This series may be of some interest to people who are into magic and demons storyline, but for anyone who plans on buying this as a replacement for Kenshin, do yourself a favor and skip it.",1057276800,,248,4.297872340425532
1862283,4,B00008V2UM,"well this review isn't much about samurai deeper kyoo the show, its about the dvd. tthe show is very cool though. just to tell you if you get volume one it has a glitch in the main menu. in setup it says english language, english language with subtitles, and english language with subtitles. yes it says english language with subtitles twice. the topb left english language with subtitles is actually supposed to be japanese language with subtitles and the bottom right one should say english language with subtitles like it does. besides that there are no other glitches on volume one and its an awesome series.",1057104000,,612,4.783018867924528
1862284,4,B00008V2UM,"After seeing and reading Kenshin I searched and searched for another samurai anime on the same scale.  Never found one, and I still haven't.  Samurai Deeper is very cool, but it cannot be compaired to Rurouni Kenshin.  Instead I think that Samurai Deeper can be best compaired to the anime Ninja Scroll.
Lets just say, if you are only looking for a ""realistic"" samurai anime (by realistic I mean no magic, no monsters, etc) then you will probably want to pass on Samurai Deeper.  If you are looking for a fun anime in general, definetely pick this one up... well maybe not this box set.  Seems a bit too pricy just for a box and 1 DVD.",1055376000,,635,4.3931623931623935
1862285,5,B00008V2UM,"I really love this anime. These first 5 episodes were magnificent.
Basically a killer called Kyo has too find his body while he inhabits some boy's. The series is extremely well done, but it has a flaw.
The animation may be the only problem. Now, the first episode feels more like a pilot episode. The animation isn't that great but you get to see some awesome scenes and such. But the animation is little. The next 4 episodes on this DVD have a bit more animation. It seems to increase as they go. You will probably notice the first few fights having basically a guy cutting someone. You see him, then the screen flashes with a sword slash, then you see him in a different pose and the enemy is gone. This changes a little and by the end of the 5 episodes, you will probably be ready to buy the next DVD.
I haven't read the manga, but this series really is great. The plot is wonderful. There are new things happening a lot and by the end of episode 3 it hits you... this plot was really well done. DBZ ran out of ideas but had good animation throughout. This series relys more on beautiful pictures and effects. Namely, the blue shine of a sword, the wind, the night sky, the rain, and namely everything makes the pictures more vivid. Now don't get me wrong, this series does have animation. There is not as much as DBZ, but there is much more than fist of the north star and it is beautful.
Well one more flaw.... the ending song doesn't really feel like it belongs. It is kind of a pop song that comes out of nowhere. Not a good choice, but you can skip it.
Cool characters, nice plot, and wonderful drawings. Brilliant.",1073606400,,1624,4.310457516339869
1862286,5,B00008V2UM,"This series is awesome. I was hooked from the first time i heard the line ""You heard it to didn't you? The voice of the wind."" With a great storyline and awesome charecter development, this is by far my favorite series.",1073347200,,219,4.365853658536586
1862287,5,B00008V2UM,"Looks like the beginning of a great series.  I am hooked already.  Will definately buy remainding dvd's.  Good plot and very exciting to watch.  Pretty funny in it's own way too.  I've already become attached to the characters.  The dubbing is pretty good and I've only seen some of the subtitles but from those, they are pretty good too.  The beginning/ending songs are cool too.  Don't have a bad thing to say about samurai deeper kyo.  Can't wait to get rest of the dvd's!",1070323200,2,475,4.559523809523809
1862288,2,B00008V2UM,"I must have seen the ""sanitized for your protection"" version.
The beginning held some promise of some really good samurai action, but then it turned into something just as silly as that Kenshin foolishness. No blood, no guts plus alot of off-screen swordplay made me very sleepy.
Each episode is just like the last one: Monster grabs/assaults the female bounty hunter then Kyo ""Hulks Out"" and bloodlessly kills it. The End.
Some of the side characters are pretty interesting though and the sub-plot is not half bad; but I'd rather watch Ninja Scroll again than this.",1067817600,,566,4.90625
1862289,4,B00008V2UM,"This is a surprising twist on the Samurai legends of arising in the battles that marked the rise of the Tokugawa Shogunate.  In the carnage of the critical battle of Sekigahara a feared Samurai - Demon Eyes Kyo - comes face to face with another powerful swordsman - Kyoshiro Mibu.  Just as Kyoshiro took the upper hand for the last time, they are struck by a meteor.  All that is left is some dust and Kyo's sword - Murimasa.
The scene shifts to years later, and we find Kyoshiro in the part of a feeble minded intinerant apothecary, seeming the innocent victim of his own misadventures.  Then the intervention of Yukimora Saneda triggers a terrifying change, and Demon Eyes Kyo's spirit regains consciousness - in the body of Kyoshiro.  Suddenly we are catapulted into a drama of clan warfare, demonic ninjas and balletic (and ballistic) swordmanship.
What makes this story even more unusual is that it quickly becomes apparent that appearances and reality shift without warning.  At first Kyo seems evil, but then we get glimpses of something deeper.  Is this the influence of the unconscious Kyoshiro?  Or is the relationship between the two of them something else entirely.
And what exactly are Saneda's motivations?  Ostensibly he in the service of Kyoshiro's wife and clan, but why does he insist on waking Kyo.  Throw in a beautiful bounty hunter and the heir to the Tokugawa empire and a genuinely complex and interesting story develops.
As is often the case when Japanese anime decides to experiment with a normally predictable genre, music, art, and script are excellent.  Acting in the dubbed version is only average, but it stays fairly close to the subtitles and is listenable.  I found this first DVD both intriguing and enjoyable with hints of potential greatness.  Worth following.",1064188800,7,1797,4.930232558139535
1862290,5,B00008V2UM,"Hey this is an awesome series, but the main reason im a fan of this is not just the action but the story that is filled with information with interesting tidbits of info on Japanese history.  Its really great how some of the characters are some of the most prominent characters of the Tokugawa era, it adds a bit of interest that most series don't have.  But hey the action is great to, you will love to see how Kyo summons all his great techniques and lets just say before the end of the series Mizuchi and Red Mirage are not gonna be the only techniques you will see.",1060560000,,569,4.2110091743119265
1862291,5,B00008V2UM,"Hey this is a nice beginning to a series drawn nicely. ( I mean in the aspects of the story) I watched Kenshin and yeah i loved it but not in the first few epsiodes and you would be wise not to judge this anime from only the first five. In time this could probably become one even greater than Kenshin. The main character a split personality dude name kyoshiro has got big problems with a demon livin in him. The probable love interest between him and the young blonde bounty hunter keeps you pondering if she has what it takes to change him for the better.
Well i don't like to spoil so i will only say you would be wise to just give it a try I promise no matter what type of anime you are into you won't be dissappointed......",1059436800,,728,4.0979020979020975
1862292,4,B00008V2UM,"I've seen Kenshin, loved it, and was eager to see another 'samurai' anime so I checked out Samurai Deeper Kyo (SDK). Despite a somewhat confusing opening - lots of place names and people plus told in flashback then fast forwarded 4 years - once the story got going and I got things sorted out I rather liked it. Initially I had been disappointed because from what I gathered of the story Kyoshiro is supposed to be the hero of our tale who is somehow afflicted with carrying the personality of his rival, an evil samurai (and possible demon) called Demon Eyes Kyo.
Unfortunately Kyoshiro seemed pretty bland and boring, and a lecher to boot. I had my doubts that this guy could be interesting and sympathetic enough to carry a series. But the spunky bounty-hunter Yuya and some intriguing glimpses of Yukimura Sanada helped keep me interested until the third episode, when things really start heating up. For one the milquetoast Kyoshiro's personality is completely subsumed by Kyo - who appears to be one legitmate, bad-a** dude. And not in the way Kenshin becomes the Battosoui when necessary, but reverts to his peace-loving self. If Kyo has any regrets it's likely that hasn't completely wiped out all his enemies yet. So far so good. There are also hints that the current situation has it's roots in a complex web of past alliances, battles and relantionships. Kyo is nasty all right, but there are hints that he might be that way for a reason, which sounds interesting. Also, who the heck is Yukimura and what's his deal? I don't know if he's helping Kyo or what, but I can believe he's got his own interests firmly at the forefront.
Besides meeting the main characters, Kyo, Yuya, Yukimura and Benitora, we also get a sense there are a lot of bad guys, some kenyou (monsters), rogue ninja groups, heirs in disguise, political intrigues, and some interfering women who also appear to be running the show behind the scenes. Oh, and there's some humor as well. Yukimura commands a group of ninjas (?) including a super-serious guy who works what could best be described as magic. Yukimura seems to enjoy yanking his chain once in a while which is rather humerous.
So overall the characters and the story show some definate promise. The animation is pretty decent, although there are a couple of shots of Kyoshiro where his arms have a really weird perspective which looks awful. There also seem to be a few too many stills and the battles themselves aren't too thrilling. No exciting action ala Kenshin since it's more implied than shown. Although who can resist an evil grin and the line: ""You heard it too,  didn't you? The voice of the wind.""
I'm looking forward to the rest of this release, hopefully it will live up to it's promise. There's also an outakes extra (english dub) on this disc. Normally they ..., but this one actually had a couple of funny moments. And if there continue to be 5 episodes per disc that will be great. So if you like swords, Japanese history and demons and magic this might be the next anime for you.",1058745600,4,3038,4.667910447761194
1862293,5,B00008V2UM,"This series is awesome!  AnimeWorks has done a wonderful job with this DVD.  The animation is flawless, the characters are wonderful and believable, and even the music is absolutely gorgeous.  The humour in the series is well-placed (except for one comment the main character makes about breasts in the first epi).  The outtakes extra alone had makes this DVD worth buying.
However, what shocked me about this DVD is that there are *FIVE* episodes on it!  Unlike the trend of four -or worse, three- episodes per DVD, AnimeWorks gives a great deal of value for the buck.  A great buy and highly recommended.",1058486400,2,606,4.834951456310679
1862294,5,B00008V2UM,"Any big follower of anime will have already watched the fansub version of this anime.  I won't review the anime in great detail but suffice it to say, it's probably one of the nicest animes out there to watch.  I hear people mention Kenshin all the time but please don't buy this in the hopes of getting a kenshin clone, while they are similar in certain aspects the two differ greatly.
The DVD quality is great, a surprise as most anime DVD's i have only feature 3 or 4 episodes per disc yet this one features 5.  There isn't much in the way of features but so what.  The special DVD series box is really nice.  If you've got a good anime collection already this one will really set it off.  If you can afford it, buy this box set.",1057363200,,732,4.192857142857143

7986949,2,B00008V2UM,"At the battle of Sekigahara, the infamous Demon Eyes Kyo fought against Kyoshiro Mibu. Then a CGI meteor hit, samurai turned into monsters, and Kyo and Kyoshiro ended up being roommates in the same body.

Unfortunately, ""Samurai Deeper Kyo - Demon Awakens"" doesn't really improve after that. Technically it's an adaptation of Akimine Kamijyo's epic fantasy manga... except that the scriptwriters threw out the manga's storyline, shuffled around what was left, and threw in a bunch of ugly shapeshifting monsters. The result is a bizarre, strangely scattered anime that's riddled with plot holes and bizarre action scenes.

Four years after Sekigahara, bounty hunter Yuya Shiina nabs a minor criminal, the harmless wandering medicine man Kyoshiro Mibu. But when a bizarre snake monster (a kenyou) shows up and tries to kill them both, Kyoshiro transforms as well -- turns out he's two personalities in one body, and the other one is Demon Eyes Kyo. After the fight, he reverts back into Kyoshiro.

So Yuya decides to stick with Kyoshiro/Kyo, so she can collect a vast bounty. But it turns out that there are a lot of people (and kenyou) entangled with Kyo/Kyoshiro as well -- a devious woman named Okuni, a deadly spider-ninja, a trio of kenyou assassins, and the mysterious ex-general Yukimura Sanada. And when Okuni causes Kyo to become the dominant personality in Kyoshiro's body, the journey becomes a lot more dangerous for them all...

For some reason, apparently the people behind this anime thought bloody battles, fantasy powers and political machinations weren't interesting enough... so most of Akimine Kamijyo's manga gets tossed out the window, and instead we get shapeshifting, gravel-voiced monsters. Can you say ""dumbed down""?

As a result, these five episodes are a surreal, clumsy mess, full of plot holes (Benitora and Mahiro never noticed that their buddies were MONSTERS?), bloody fights, and half-baked political tangles involving Tokugawa and Yukimura. But every time something interesting happens, it turns out to be the kenyou's fault, Kyo kills them all, and everybody moves on.  Even the humor is wrong -- funny moments like Yukimura's gleeful ""the plan... is a secret!"" or Benitora's ""sassy lassie"" comment are always a beat off.

It also seems like the animators were either clumsy or lazy -- the episodes are crammed with still shots (especially for simple stuff like talking and walking) and dismally obvious errors. On the other hand, the outtakes are brilliant -- Dan Green is especially fun (""I gotta pee!"") especially when he sings a Sesame street song out of the blue.

The one saving grace of this anime is the characters -- Kyoshiro is a seemingly innocent, mildly lecherous man who may be worse than he seems, and Kyo is a cruel, chilly fighter who may not be as bad as he acts. Benitora is a big fight-happy goofball with a startling secret, and Yukimura is a laid-back nobleman who always seems cheerful and flirtatious (even drinking sake during a vast battle), but can be as deadly as Kyo.

It's usually not a good sign when an anime abandon most of its source material. ""Samurai Deeper Kyo - Demon Awakens"" is a bloody, scattershot beginning to the the anime, redeemed only by the likable cast.",1263254400,,3237,5.024253731343284
7986950,5,B00008V2UM,"I love a whole lot of samurai anime (Rurouni Kenshin, Samurai X, Saumrai Champloo, The Samurai, Samurai XXX ""the hentai"", Samurai Gun, Samurai 7, and more). Which now brings me to one of my newest favorit one (Samurai Deeper Kyo).

The english dubb my be horrible but thats alright for me cause American personalities are way better then Japanese.

The dvd have character profiles were they tells all about each character.

By reading the first reviewer words saying the manga is better then the anime show cause the stories are different which I really don't care cause I don't read any mangas.

This show has a lot of good action, mystery, and lots of humer it has a lot to offer.",1120176000,,682,4.6115702479338845
7986951,4,B00008V2UM,"The show isn't bad and has some great lines, namely the one about the women's kimono, not sure which episode that was in though...but if u want the REAL Samurai Deeper KYO, then you should read the manga because there isn't even a comparison. There aren't any ken'you in the manga, they like completely made those up, which is kind of annoying because if they turn a great manga into the show, they should at least keep the story the same...well i guess they thought that it would be more interesting this way...whatever....anyway, just get the manga because the manga rocks and is way better then the anime!",1109203200,,608,4.638888888888889
7986952,3,B00008V2UM,"If your new to this genre or a fan of the rurouni kenshin series you will love it. The setting is based in medieval japan during the 1500's. The main charcters have a coloful modern style. The story has the nice mix of serious action with a dose of humor and mystery. However I did find some stereotypical things in it. Also the story at first is bit muddy especially in the dubbed english version, but after the first few episodes things do get better. I will not say this is a great anime because I have seen better in this same genre. Overall its a good start for a new series. I certainly do not regret watching it or adding it to my collection.",1103673600,,649,4.2
7986953,5,B00008V2UM,"This anime has moved to the top three in my list of favorite animes. I love Berserk, Cowboy Bebop, Trigun, Big O, Armitage (all of them), Escaflowne, Rocord Of Lodoss, & many more. Demon Eyes Kyo is now tied at second place with Cowboy Bebop.
I absolutely loved each of the main characters. They had great humor and complete loyalty to one another.
I purchased the complete collection because of some happy reviews that I read. I had no idea what to expect and I fell in love with the series ten minutes into the first episode. It felt, somewhat, like watching the FOX TV series '24' in the fact that you just couldn't get enough and had to keep watching to see what was going to happen next.

The Japanese language is so much better on your ears, that is if you mind reading the subtitles.  But you can learn lots of Japanese words and phrases by listening to it!  The story is also really good because it is based on the Japanese history and the real people, but this is set in an alternate universe.  And the inserts in the dvd describe the real people that the characters are based on and the history, so you can get some background on the story, and kind of have an idea of whats going on.  :P  The characters are all great and the animation is so clear!!  And the music is defenitaly awesome, it kinda has the ""bad boy"" feeling to it, especially when Kyo is battling.  All in all, this is a series that you should not miss!
