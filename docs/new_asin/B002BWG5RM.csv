8362132,3,B002BWG5RM,"The first dvd, Desert Light is beautiful, definitely up to David Fortney standards.  The second, Earth Flight, is also beautiful--if you don't already have ""Timeless"", the source of a large part of this dvd.  The third DVD, Reflections, has some good scenery, but is ruined by an entirely different style--closeups of plants, etc., and any beginner can do as well.  Wish I had known that a very large portion is a reprint of other work, with some poor quality to fill out the Reflections dvd.

But:  David Fortney is an outstanding creator of this type video, only the last approximately half of the Reflections video leaves a negative impression of Fortney.",1348358400,,658,4.891891891891892
8362133,5,B002BWG5RM,"This multi-disk set gathers together extended excerpts from David Fortney's previous works such as Timeless (National Parks), Earthscapes, Earthdance, et al and may have been remastered a bit to keep up with advances in HDTV and the like. I never tire watching Mr. Fortney's exquisite work, even if I've viewed it many times previously, and that speaks to its potency for relaxation and renewal. The breathtaking imagery refreshes the mind, taking you to a different place where you move across time, view intriguing plays of intricate color palettes, watch clouds and shadows form, then travel across the landscape in nonlinear fashion--so surreal it stirs the imagination. The patience, prescience and technical prowess to pull this off so effectively staggers the mind. Aside from visual content, the main difference from his earlier works is that the accompanying music has switched from the ""New Age"" genre to classical music. One caveat I found distracting was the occasional inclusion of a faux flock of geese flying past. It becomes obvious that these were edited in and not part of the original scene. However, the overall perspectives across time that are the mainstay of the video series do not warrant discrediting solely on this latter intrusion.",1325462400,2,1259,5.237623762376238
