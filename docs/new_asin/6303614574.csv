Rick Rossovich has never been better, plus you have Paul Sorvino and Elliot Gould, and all of them in a good story that should have been in the theatres years ago.  Can't miss.",1368403200,,333,4.107692307692307
7852614,4,6303614574,"If you ever saw the ""shrinkage"" episode on Seinfeld, you know who Courtney Taylor is. She was George's date for that weekend at the coast. Jerry, Kramer and Elaine had the pleasure of seeing Courtney's character go topless, but George missed out as usual. Then his girl suddenly leaves and George agonizes that it has to do with his ""shrinkage"" after swimming. Courtney only appeared briefly in that episode but you remember her.

That's because Courtney Taylor is a babe. She is the reason this movie exists; it all centers around her as the beauty in peril. But even with all its cliches, Cover Me turns out to be a decent crime thriller B-movie. A serial killer is targeting models who appear on the cover of an LA skin mag. Police don't realize the killer dresses as a woman to get close to his victims. Meanwhile Courtney's character is a cop who loses her job because of a wrongful shooting incident (off-screen). She is also sleeping with a detective who is on the serial killer case. Grasping an opportunity to be re-instated on the force, she agrees to pose as a nude model to trap the killer. Naturally, this being an erotic thriller, scenes of Ms. Taylor's natural wonders abound in nude photo shoots as well as love scenes.

Aside from Courtney Taylor, good character actors like Paul Sorvino and Elliot Gould help to lift this movie from forgettable B-movie fare into something worth seeing.",1125360000,6,1404,4.726530612244898
