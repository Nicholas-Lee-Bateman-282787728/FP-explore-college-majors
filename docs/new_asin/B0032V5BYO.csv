4062679,5,B0032V5BYO,I'm lucky to have a husband who enjoys cooking and knows his way around the kitchen.  But I have to admit that I feel guilty and wish I could cook a delicious meal for him as he does for me.  I enjoy watching cooking shows like Top Chef but feel very intimidated when it's my turn to cook.  Cooking for the Clueless answers many of the questions a novice like myself has.  The host and the chef seem so approachable and break down the process easliy on how to cook a delicious meal. The host asks all the right questions that the clueless cook needs answering. Other cooking shows or videos do not seem to cover the basics like this DVD does.  Another aspect that I enjoyed was the variety of recipes covered by different chefs.  I finally was able to surprise my husband with a great pasta dinner this week instead of a frozen meal.,1266710400,5,833,4.3076923076923075
4062680,5,B0032V5BYO,"I was was truly ""clueless"" about cooking before this DVD!  My poor kids had to contend w/ boxed macaroni and cheese and spaghetti for every meal if we weren't spending tons of money on take out.

This is an wonderful DVD which has taught me tips and tricks as well as saving me money. Cooking is truly effortless with great results with ""Cooking for the Clueless.""  Highly recommend it for everyone!",1264896000,5,399,4.591549295774648
4062681,5,B0032V5BYO,"Its not just another recipe dvd, its a great cooking school dvd. Its fun to watch and good for people that need to learn one thing or another about how to cook. LOVE THIS DVD.",1264550400,3,175,4.0285714285714285
4062682,5,B0032V5BYO,"That's me - a self-proclaimed ""clueless cook"" the one that burns cookies, overcooks chicken and fish and even burned pasta (which I thought was impossible).

When I watched Cooking for the Clueless it was a complete eye opener. I was always too embarrased to admit I couldn't follow a recipe because I didn't know what all the terms meant. This DVD tells you every detail and is easy to follow along with. The recipes are delicious, even for extremely picky eaters like my husband.

If you have any difficulty with cooking, this DVD is a fabulous investment!!",1264118400,5,559,4.752577319587629
4062683,5,B0032V5BYO,"I have bought dozens of cookbooks in my life, but it's been like reading a foreign language. For the first time, we had the family Christmas dinner at our house. We made a turkey, and it didn't go as well as we had hoped. My wife and I decided we wanted to learn more about cooking. We eat dinner out far too often due to our lack of comfort in the kitchen. I heard about this DVD from a friend that raved about it. I wasn't really interested until he told me that it is good for those that want to learn kitchen basics, and a lot more. So I ordered it and my wife and I sat down and watched it. It seemed that every 3-4 minutes we would have an ""Oh, that makes sense"" moment. Things like how to cut meat in order to have it be more tender. I have always done it wrong. Anyway, these DVD's are full of wonderful things like this. My wife and I have cooked at home everyday for the last 2 weeks and are enjoying the experience. I never knew it could be so fun. It's funny, but the things we've learned from watching the DVD's seem so basic, but we never had a clue. No pun intended.
We gave these DVD's to a friend and she loves them as well. I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone. This may be my first review I've ever done, so that says a lot.
If you buy  this, you won't be disappointed.

8387652,4,B0032V5BYO,"its give you what is expected and as per the ""Editorial Reviews"", I can answer if you have any questions",1355097600,,104,4.25
8387653,1,B0032V5BYO,"I purchased this thinking as a new cook it would give me the basics of cooking skills and teach me techniques such as grilling, frying, broiling, cutting, and other techniques however it just seems that the host and producer decided to watch the Food network and take a couple of random recipes and cut them together into a cooking show. The host has no emotions whatsoever. I had to turn it off after about 15 minutes... really disappointed.",1307577600,,442,4.67948717948718
8387654,1,B0032V5BYO,This DVD is useless. I wanted to learn how to cook. Instead what I got was chit chat between experienced cooks. I was expecting the basics of cooking with some beginning applications. I could not cook before I purchased this item and I still cannot cook after the purchase. Save your money. I wish I could get mine back.,1292025600,2,320,4.440677966101695
8387655,4,B0032V5BYO,I enjoyed the dvd was very easy to follow and professional quality but was hoping to be able to print recipes directly from the dvd not directed to another site.,1275868800,2,161,4.4
8387656,2,B0032V5BYO,"Bought this for my daughter's 30th birthday due to the reviews.  Just got a call from her tellling me I obviously haven't a clue as to how clueless she truly is about cooking! She said it with laughter!  She didn't think it was for a person that doesn't really understand cooking and following recipes.  She is highly intelligent, but cooking doesn't come easy for her. Her husband and three daughters also had high hopes, but now we are back to square one and I am out the cost of a dvd that didn't help. I am very disappointed and don't think I will ever place any importance on reviews.",1275696000,2,589,4.385321100917431

8387658,5,B0032V5BYO,I loved this DVD.  The recipies are delicious and Zuzy and the chef's make it so easy.  Chef Preston really gives great tips too!  A great gift for anyone who is a bit clueless in the kitchen....,1268092800,4,195,4.216216216216216
8387659,4,B0032V5BYO,"Cooking for the Clueless offers a step-by-step approach to cooking both cozy in-home meals and those that look presentable for a restaurant. Zuzy is warm and animated, and entertaining to watch. The segments are chock-full of ""bite size"" tidbits featuring a fantastic education on food and its origin.",1268092800,3,301,5.291666666666667
8387660,5,B0032V5BYO,My wife Griselda and myself have always wanted to become better cooks.  We reviewed this amazing DVD and came away quite impressed.  Zuzy and her guests do a wonderful job of showing the audience that it isn't really hard to become a good chef and make delicious meals.  We would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who likes to cook but doesn't have a true feel for what they are doing in the kitchen!  You will love it!,1267574400,3,421,4.358974358974359
