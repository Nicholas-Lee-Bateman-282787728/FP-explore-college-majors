From the Brit-angle, only negative comment I have is wondering WHY the
finale's demise of the T-Rex wasn't the ORIGINAL idea in the first place...
oh yeah! It wasn't IN the plot-line.",1528761600,,258,5.317073170731708
8454096,1,B0052OSMZY,"This movie is a train wreck. Bad special effects,bad dialogue, and bad acting. the beginning is a ripoff of ""Sudden Impact"" and there is no originality. I love sci fi and B movies but this is one you can skip.",1528761600,,209,4.25
8454097,2,B0052OSMZY,"""Xtinction: Predator X"" is the original 2010 title. The film is being recirculated as ""Jurassic Predator"" as things with ""Jurassic"" in the title are being bought up. This isn't much of a story. One lone clone experiment predator kills locals. Sheriff (Lochlyn Munro) investigates. There are bad guys. Laura is the ex-wife (Elena Lyons) and Lacey Minchew sits around tied up in a bra having been ""used.""

I didn't see the end coming out of the blue. The film is SyFy made for TV quality. I don't know how they missed this gem.

8454098,4,B0052OSMZY,"If you're the kind of movie viewer who's heart skips a beat on reading the words of my review title, then I think you'll like this flick just fine.  I grew up with reruns of old  '50s monster movies, and if you did also, then let me present a comparison so you get some idea of what tier this movie occupies in the monster movie universe.  Remember the ""strengthier"" flicks like ""the Monster that Challenged the World"", ""20 Million Miles to Earth"", and ""The Creature from the Black Lagoon""?  Well, this one doesn't fall into that category.  This movie's spiritual forbears would be the ultra-low budget shock-dependent flicks like ""The She-Creature"", ""Giant Gila Monster"" or ""Monster On Campus"".

With that caveat in mind, it should come as no surprise that the titular monster is a rather low-grade CGI construct that is (very) sparingly used.  I would have greatly preferred some huge rubber prop, as that would have fit in with the nature of this production splendidly.  However, all is not as bad as it seems;  the brief glimpses of the monster underwater are rather creepy, with few re-used shots, and for cheap CGI, it has a rather solid look to it.  Best of all, it actually looks like the creature depicted on the DVD case and, in my opinion, still looks better than most Sy-Fy CGI critters.

The cast is quite competent  and well cast.  If the occasional line seems trite, remember that most people, in their daily lives, mindlessly repeat phrases programmed into them by TV and internet.  I believe this was intentional on the scriptwriter's part, as most of the other lines are quite realistic and well-delivered by the actors.  Stupid actions by protagonists were still present, although kept to a bare minimum compared to some flicks of this type. Picture quality was surprisingly beautiful, with (to me) fascinating if dismal Louisianna swamps for a setting (it seemed to be filmed during winter).  In one scene where the Sheriff is having a confrontation with the main character's ex-husband, the camera moves in circles around the two men.  Although this has been done before, I thought it wasn't so much derivative here as well-used in the context of what was going on onscreen.

Story line concentrates quite a bit on a pair of murderous backwoods inbreds hired by the main villain to help with procurring victims for his experiments.  This is quite in keeping with films like Ed Wood's ""Bride of the Monster"" and makes this one quite similar to ""Razorback"".  I suppose this helped cut down on the need to show the monster, but there was enough monster action to satisfy, considering I would rather have not seen the film makers try to show something they really didn't have the financial chops to show.  A couple of shocking moments, but not a whole lot of gore, though what there is is pretty convincing.  No nudity.

Although the production values are similar to Sy-Fy's (if not even lower), the film is made with more skill than most of that network's and with a much more serious tone.  Recommended.",1446595200,,3022,4.7784200385356455
