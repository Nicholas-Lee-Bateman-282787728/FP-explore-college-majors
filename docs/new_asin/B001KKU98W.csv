There is A LOT going on for a punk power trio... Jorma was playing exceptionally well...

and I was equally impressed with the guys..  they were tight..  Walking Blues,  Valley of Tears

especially smokin",1295136000,7,303,4.518518518518518
8315102,2,B001KKU98W,I've read reviews of this elsewhere and I would have to agree;a fairly lackluster performance. I've seen Jorma perform with Hot Tuna a number of times and the performances were high energy to say the least. I'm not sure what was going on with him during this period but he seems a little disinterested . The backing sounds merely adequate. Maybe it was an engineering problem.,1270080000,4,376,4.712121212121212
8315103,4,B001KKU98W,"Interesting time in Jorma's career. Picking up on the punk thing to liven things up. Nicely documented here from a 1980 German TV show. The complete set of 13 songs. Video quality is excellent. Sound could be better (no stereo) but it's OK. Don't expect any long drawn out rampage jamming. Everything is pretty much kept short and sweet with old favorites like Trimmed and Burning with the Stench bros. handling the rhythm section admirably. Some nice psych guitar and fingerpickin' here and there but for the most part the playing is raw and hard for the old rock 'n roll and blues numbers like Money Honey, Milk Cow (my fave via Eddie Cochran) and Walking Blues, as well as the newer material (Running' With The Fast Crowd) from his Barbecue King and Jorma solo albums. If you like Jorma, you won't be disappointed.",1242172800,5,817,4.680555555555555
8315104,2,B001KKU98W,"I'M IN MY EARLY 60'S AND HAVE BEEN LISTENING TO JORMA FOR 40 YEARS. TOO BAD THIS DVD HAS SUCH HORRIBLE QUALITY AUDIO. I'M GLAD THAT ROCKPALAST SAW FIT TO RELEASE SOME OF THESE GEMS BUT THEY COULD HAVE DONE MUCH BETTER ON THE AUDIO. I OWN SOME NICE EQUIPTMENT WITH A 40 BAND GRAPHIC EQ
AND STILL COULDN'T GET THE SOUND RIGHT. THE COMMANDER CODY RELEASE HAS SOMEWHAT BETTER AUDIO BUT IT STILL TOOK SOME WORK TO MAKE IT LISTENABLE. SOME OF THE BOOTS FLOATING AROUND OF THESE SHOWS ARE ACTUALLY BETTER IN QUALITY.........",1241827200,7,517,4.4526315789473685
