8172268,5,B000MTOM62,"Black Cat is the story of Train Hartnet and his bounty hunting friends. There in business to make a buck, but they keep getting involved with a gang of magic users hat are trying to take over the world. The Apostles of the Star is a gang led by one of Train's old syndicate colleagues who has a creepy infatuation with him.

This anime has plenty of action and comic relief. The animation is great and so is the soundtrack. Both English and Japanese voice tracks are pretty good. I think this anime had a little too much filler in it, but not enough to hurt the series. All of the characters are cool and very likable. The story is also kind of unique.

I had a good time watching this anime and for the price you can't go wrong.",1354579200,,729,4.2
8172269,4,B000MTOM62,"Creed has assembled all of the Tao powered supervillains of the series in an organization called ""The Apostles of the Stars"". He doesn't really see himself as evil though. In fact Creed thinks he will be able to free the world from the Illuminati-like control of Chronos and let mankind control its own destiny. Of course, a lot of maniacs think of themselves as saviors, and Creed isn't any different. He'd like nothing better than for Train to join him and is constantly frustrated and maddened by Train's continued devotion to the murdered Saya and his desire for revenge. Not all of the Apostles are bad though. One of its members, the fire-wielding Kyoko, has fallen in love with Train, and decides to defect, along with the tophat wearing Charden, who also admires Train. Train's old employer, Chronos, still has an interest in their best assassin, and Sephiria, the Number who trained Black Cat, is sent to scout out his intentions and decide whether he should be allowed to live.

Volume 4 of Black Cat was one of the better entries in an outstanding series, mostly because the stories were a bit quirkier than usual, and the animation was of a better quality. Sometimes, Black Cat pulls too many cheap camera shots to cover up for a lack of animation. This fourth volume also included some of the funniest episodes, such as Kyoko's sloppy love story and when Train and the others take the bounty for a lost lizard. Problem is, the lizard has grown to Godzilla like stature in the sewers beneath the city! It's not all fun and games as humor and cuteness mix up with drama when Train and Eve come to the aid of homeless orphans being threatened by the Yakuza. A really good volume.",1183680000,,1689,4.648829431438127
