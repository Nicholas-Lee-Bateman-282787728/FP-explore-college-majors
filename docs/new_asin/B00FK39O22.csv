Extremely entertaining! SRK is defo KING!
Love him like crazy.
If you haven't owned this film, don't hesitate. You'll love it too.

5994147,5,B00FK39O22,"Saw this film on the big screen, and can't wait to own it. SRK was at his best--making fun of his image as a 'big screen lover', his past roles and just about everything about him. This film pays homage to many of his past films as well as Shetty's prior films. Deepika and SRK's chemistry is still there from prior films--and they mesh so well together! This a fun movie that will cheer you up! A must have for any Bollywood or SRK fan!",1382313600,3,437,4.152941176470589

5994152,5,B00FK39O22,"In an interview, Rohit Shetty remarked that he does not make films for the critics and does not care about creating classics. He simply wants to entertain and he makes sure that the person who buys the ticket goes back home as a happy customer. He is doing that aspect of his job especially well, his last three films have entered the coveted 100 crore club the equivalent of a diamond jubilee ( A movie which runs at a single theater consecutively for 50 weeks is considered a diamond jubilee). He is selling a brand of cinema which is colorful, over the top and entertaining. Who understands this notion about branding and popularity than Shahrukh Khan a person who has trademarked his name SRk as a brand. While SRK enjoys undisputed popularity his popularity in India is not what it is used to be, the last time SRk had a humongous hit was with Om Shanti Om- his last few releases even though hits were lackluster by his standards.
Eyebrows were raised when Rohit Shetty and SRK joined hands, both had their favorite camps - Shetty with Ajay Devgan and SRK with Yash Chopra and Karan Johar however SRk has had maintained that he did want to try out something different. The results are there for us to see, Chennai Express in its opening weekend smashed many box office records and is on its way to become on the biggest films of this year.
I was very apprehensive to watch it because big budget movies are so hyped that the end result is less than satisfactory. However I did and found myself in a packed movie theater sitting on the front row. Did I enjoy the movie? I did so did the others. The movie ended with a standing ovation from the audience.

The movie begins with a flashback with a blood bathed SRK- in the film he plays a 40 year old guy who has been assigned to immersing the ashes of his dead grandfather in the waters of Rameswaran. He decides to board the Chennai Express and as the train pulls from the platform ( The most hilarious spoof on DDLJ takes place - please watch this, I got the most laughs from this scene and the rest of the train episode). We are next introduced to Meenamma ( Deepika Padukone)
Meenamma has been running away from her father who wants her to marry a boy of his choice- she is guarded by her fathers goons who are taking her back home. This is what ensues in the 143 minutes

SRK as usual delivers a over the top, out of control, and energetic performance, the role asks for it. There is effortless acting in his many scenes in the train initially when he taunts the goons and plugs Nokia incessantly. There are many such product plugs throughout the film. His interactions with Tangaballi as he mocks and pokes him throughout the film are fun to watch. There is so much spring in the overacting that it is hard not to like the performance. Loved his banter with the little person- amazing fun. During the entire film he makes fun of his own movies in a way that is hilarious. I hope he continues to work with other directors who have a sense of commercial cinema as well as Shetty. I hope his next film Happy New Year continues to take him higher. Hate SRK or Love him- You will enjoy this one.and finally ""dont underestimate the power of this Khan""

Deepika Padukone, the heir apparent to Katrina Kaif delivers yet another performance which assures her a shot of being the next number one actress. Another scene that I laughed was her take off on Vidya Balans act in Bhool Bhoolaiya or her Sauchalay song in the train.

Rohit Shetty marries his sense of entertainment with a riot of color and the film is very pretty to look at. Southern India as in Munnar along with Wai and Goa looks gorgeous. He can't restrain himself enough though as he does resort to flying and exploding cars towards the end. The film's story is not path breaking but it is the narrative that keeps us engrossed. Rohit Shetty has all the skill to become a worthy successor to Manmohan Desai.

Vishal Shekhar's music is good but not great. I liked Kashmir Main and the final Lungi Dance tribute to Rajnikanth- fun ( Honey Singh composed this one though)

I immensely enjoyed Chennai Express, notwithstanding the front row seat. It is a fun, fun, filled film which spoofs many films all done with style and a flavor for which Rohit Shetty is capable of. My views are echoed by the thousands of people around the world and India who have watched it and made it the highest opening for any Indian film ever. Just loved it and will watch it again. 5 stars. 8/9/2013",1381190400,16,4489,4.448359659781288

5994165,3,B00FK39O22,"Its nice to see Deepika Padukone and Shah Rukh Khan back in the same movie, the last time being Om Shanti Om made in 2007. This time Shah Rukh Khan plays a 40-year-old man Rahul, who gets involved with a powerful local family in Southern India, when on the train he tries to save a beautiful girl Meena (played by Deepika Padukone) from a group of thugs.

It is not difficult to guess from what Meena is really running away; and Rahul has to do for her reluctantly. This is a light-hearted romantic comedy with a few gorgeous musical sequences, but unlike Om Shanti Om there is no tragic undertone here. Jokes are often silly, and so are action scenes (in which cars flip and fly in a ridiculous way).

The Bollywood film is notable for its setting as most events take place in Southern India. Tamil cinema star Satyaraj appears as Meenas strict father. Some jokes are clearly based on the language/cultural differences, those jokes are lost on those who do not speak Hindi/Tamil languages like me.

Chennai Express is mindless fun, with a threadbare storyline and cardboard characters. As a comedy it is pretty enjoyable. As a romance it is weak.",1440374400,,1147,4.640394088669951

Also, the subtitles are not good.  The words ran  together.  I sent it back for another copy which does not play on  all  DVD players.",1433548800,,300,4.327272727272727
5994168,4,B00FK39O22,"I first saw this in a theater and hated it. Endless sound tags to SRK's old films, wild overacting by him, dialogue jokes predicated on differences between Hindi and Tamil that I couldn't understand (I am English-only)...and unmemorable songs.

BUT! After a long dry spell of seeing no new Hindi films, and being a big SRK fan, I decided to buy the film and try again. Revelation! I LOVED it! The color is enough (in a happy way!) to make your eyes bleed! It's exuberant! SRK's acting is NOT overblown, but correct and apt, and merely suitably farcical as called for. In much of the film, notably the 2nd half, he's quite himself, and excellent as usual.

I liked Deepika a lot. She has grown greatly since Om Shanti Om. Her beauty, grace, subtlety, and sense of humor are all on display here.

The songs are appropriate and quite enjoyable, IMO. And all those old-movie tags I hated? MY bad! I ""got"" most the 2nd time around, which, as intended, only made the movie richer and more enjoyable.

Chennai Express has gone 'way up on my list of SRK-starrers. I'll certainly enjoy it multiple times hence.",1431388800,3,1101,4.6020408163265305

5994173,5,B00FK39O22,"Chennai Express is not a work of cinematic art.  It won't win any awards.  It's pure crowd-pleasing entertainment, a popcorn movie, and it makes no apologies for it.

This is clearly a project that was a lot of fun and also a labor of love for all involved.  Nearing 50, Shah Rukh Khan, caked in makeup but still in top physical shape, puts in a good performance.  At this point in his career, he can choose whatever projects he wants, and he's come in for a lot of criticism for not challenging himself enough or playing to his ability.  But I think it's unfair to level that criticism at him for choosing this movie.  It's clear that he's having a lot of fun, lampooning his past performances and poking fun at his advancing age.

Deepika Padukone impressed me the most out of the entire cast.  I wish she would do more roles like this, honestly.  She's funny, beautiful, and a bit off her rocker all at once in this movie, and deservedly gets the headlines.

You don't go into a movie like this expecting a deep experience, with gritty realism or profound social commentary.  The plot has holes big enough to drive a train through.  Yes, Chennai doesn't factor into the story at all, and the titular train is gone within the first 15 minutes, but that's not the point.  This is more of a ""love letter"" from Bollywood to South Indian cinema, and it has all the hallmarks of the latter:  over-the-top fights, cornball comedy with weird sound effects, idealized villages, goons and village dons, the hero saving the heroine in distress.  It has offended some people because of this, but honestly, it seems that every Indian movie these days offends someone (just look at any Wikipedia entry for any Indian film released in the last decade, and the disclaimer at the beginning of this movie).  I've seen my share of South Indian cinema, and this is a pretty good parody of it.  Is that a bad thing?  Absolutely not.  Chennai Express is trying to be a tribute to it, as well as a satire.

And it's a heck of a lot of fun.  That's the main thing.  The 140 minute running time goes by in a breeze, and as long as you don;t go in with prior expectations, you'll come away from this feeling good and smiling.  All the elements taken together make this destined to become a modern classic in the ""masala"" genre, in my opinion.  It's a crowd-pleaser, which shows that language is a barrier and a cause for a comedy-of-errors, but also can be a bridge between peoples.

So, yeah...get on the train, baby!  Shut your brain off and enjoy the ride.",1425859200,,2536,4.49234135667396
5994174,5,B00FK39O22,This movie addressed so many complex social issues in India's culture. SRK and the creators of this film are to be commended for their attempts to present the sticky issues of society in such a sensitive and at times humorous portrayal. It is this characteristic in SRK that makes him such an outstanding individual and actor. Thank you Mr. Khan for making us think!,1424649600,2,366,4.734375

5994187,4,B00FK39O22,"It's a cause for raising eyebrows when, in CHENNAI EXPRESS, Deepika Padukone gets top billing over Bollywood superstar Shahrukh Khan. And yet somewhen during the second or third acts it may dawn on you that it's Deepika who quietly owns the film. She never fails to bring grace and beauty to the screen. Still, CHENNAI EXPRESS shattered all manner of box office records in India, mostly because of what Shahrukh brings to the table.

Me, I vastly prefer the understated Shahrukh who beautifully grounded films such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Swades/dp/B000P25X14/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Swades</a>&nbsp;(2004),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chakde-India/dp/B000WOQKL2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chakde! India</a>&nbsp;(2007), and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rab-Ne-Bana-Di-Jodi/dp/B0026I0NEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi</a>&nbsp;(2008). CHENNAI EXPRESS gives us the other SRK - the over-the-top, overwrought performer. So right away I've this sinking feeling. SRK is Rahul, a sheltered 40-year-old seller of sweets in Mumbai whose life is dictated by his intrusive grandfather. Rahul genuinely loves his grandpa, so when he passes away on his 100th birthday, Rahul experiences a deep sense of loss... but also vast relief. There's one familial duty to carry out: Rahul must scatter half his grandfather's ashes into the sea by Rameshwaram, a place somewhere on the distant southern tip of India. And if you must know, his grandma will scatter the other half of ashes into the Ganga in Anshaund.

Except that Rahul is making a bid for independence. He and his friends have already scheduled a holiday jaunt to sunny Goa. It's finally his chance to live life. And so Rahul puts on a deception, informing his grieving grams that he'll take the southbound Chennai Express to Rameshwaram. Truth is, he'll be on that train only until the next stop, from which he'll disembark, hook up with his chums, and motor on to Goa. Except Rahul never does make it to Goa.

Rahul's stay on the Chennai Express gets extended when he helps a fleeing Tamil girl get on board, and then he also helps on board the four large, bruising goons chasing her. These goons, who happen to be her cousins, intend to escort her back home. She's Meenamma Lochini (Padukone), daughter to the crime lord of Komban village. Meena, it turns out, is a habitual flight risk. In this instance, she's unhappy that her father has arranged her marriage. At this moment she's eyeballing Rahul, formulating a plan. Maybe the best part of the film happens during the first few minutes of our two leads' sharing screen time. Trying to talk around the goons - who only speak Tamil - Meena and Rahul communicate by hilariously taking turns singing in Hindi. The tunes they belt out should be very familiar to steadfast Bollywood audiences. Heck, I even heard ""Kajra Re"" (my personal jam) all up in there.

This is one of those movies in which one common man takes on a throng of thugs and somehow survives. But I appreciate that Rahul doesn't suddenly know kung-fu. Instead he makes use of the things around him to give himself an advantage. He still gets his butt kicked. It's sort of more believable.

CHENNAI EXPRESS is a boisterous romantic action comedy, and I rate it 3 out of 5 stars, maybe 3.5 stars, only because the camera is so infatuated with Deepika Padukone and showcases her so beautifully that I'm bewitched each time I set eyes on her. I commend Deepika for having shown growth and range as an actress. I feel that there's weight to her acting. Inasmuch as SRK is the featured attraction, it's Deepika who anchors the film, never you mind that one wonky night scene with Meena's freaky sleeping disorder.

CHENNAI EXPRESS is no&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Om-Shanti-Om-Bollywood-DVD-With-English-Subtitles/dp/B00124ONSI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Om Shanti Om Bollywood DVD With English Subtitles</a>&nbsp;(2007), which was SRK and Deepika's first collaboration. It aims for the same critical success and the same inspired giddiness flaunted by OM SHANTI OM but is hampered by the labored gags and all-around buffoonery. For most of the film, it's as if SRK is channeling Bob Hope or Don Knotts, so focused on self-preservation is his character. There's plenty of him flailing about and running away, and I don't find this endearing. In a twist, it's the damsel who, time and again, has to rescue the hero. If that doesn't throw you off and if you can stomach the lowbrow humor - and, okay, maybe I'm missing out on some comic subtleties because of the cultural divide - then maybe you'll get more enjoyment out of Meena and Rahul's sprawling journey and buy into the film's silly sense of escapism and maybe smirk at the crop of meta-cinematic references to SRK's and director Rohit Shetty's past film catalogue. It's with some reservation and a readiness to duck from hurtful things you'll throw at me that I recommend this movie.

What I have is the 2-disc set with the DVD case that feels nicely padded. Disc 1 has the feature film with an option for English sub-titles. Disc 2 has the following bonus stuff:

- Making of Chennai Express featurette (00:38:37 minutes long and bits of it in English)
- Music Video: ""Lungi Dance"" (featuring rapper Yo Yo Honey Singh)",1400976000,4,5448,5.393654524089307
5994188,4,B00FK39O22,This movie had tons of laugh out loud moments which I wasn't expecting. As far as the storyline it was a typical plot nothing complex I found it to be more of a comedy then anything else minus a couple of serious parts.

5994197,1,B00FK39O22,"One of the worst movies I have EVER seen in my life. It was a total waste of time.  Don't be fooled by the caliber of actors. Both should be ashamed to act in a movie with such useless storyline.  If after 15 minutes, you think the movie or the storyline will get better, don't bother to watch the rest.  It does NOT get better at all.  The songs are good but they are irrelevant to the movie. A movie is good when you feel part of it and you connect to the characters and their life. This has nothing of the sort.
 If you like watching selective and meaningful movies, this is not for you.  Buy English Vinglish instead. It will stay in your heart for days. Lower your expectations and you will enjoy Jab tak hai jaan or even Kahaani. Hope this helps!",1391904000,3,752,4.151724137931034

Eventually, it picked up the pace and I began to take more of an interest in the storyline.  All-in-all it was o.k., but I liked Deepika and Shahrukh better together in the Om Shanti Om film.

Truthfully, I don't like any movie where shahrukh gets beaten up as badly as he did in this movie, so that may have colored my opinion of this film.",1387670400,,512,4.425531914893617

5994210,5,B00FK39O22,"In an interview, Rohit Shetty remarked that he does not make films for the critics and does not care about creating classics. He simply wants to entertain and he makes sure that the person who buys the ticket goes back home as a happy customer. He is doing that aspect of his job especially well, his last three films have entered the coveted 100 crore club the equivalent of a diamond jubilee ( A movie which runs at a single theater consecutively for 50 weeks is considered a diamond jubilee). He is selling a brand of cinema which is colorful, over the top and entertaining. Who understands this notion about branding and popularity than Shahrukh Khan a person who has trademarked his name SRk as a brand. While SRK enjoys undisputed popularity his popularity in India is not what it is used to be, the last time SRk had a humongous hit was with Om Shanti Om- his last few releases even though hits were lackluster by his standards.
Eyebrows were raised when Rohit Shetty and SRK joined hands, both had their favorite camps - Shetty with Ajay Devgan and SRK with Yash Chopra and Karan Johar however SRk has had maintained that he did want to try out something different. The results are there for us to see, Chennai Express in its opening weekend smashed many box office records and is on its way to become on the biggest films of this year.
I was very apprehensive to watch it because big budget movies are so hyped that the end result is less than satisfactory. However I did and found myself in a packed movie theater sitting on the front row. Did I enjoy the movie? I did so did the others. The movie ended with a standing ovation from the audience.

The movie begins with a flashback with a blood bathed SRK- in the film he plays a 40 year old guy who has been assigned to immersing the ashes of his dead grandfather in the waters of Rameswaran. He decides to board the Chennai Express and as the train pulls from the platform ( The most hilarious spoof on DDLJ takes place - please watch this, I got the most laughs from this scene and the rest of the train episode). We are next introduced to Meenamma ( Deepika Padukone)
Meenamma has been running away from her father who wants her to marry a boy of his choice- she is guarded by her fathers goons who are taking her back home. This is what ensues in the 143 minutes

SRK as usual delivers a over the top, out of control, and energetic performance, the role asks for it. There is effortless acting in his many scenes in the train initially when he taunts the goons and plugs Nokia incessantly. There are many such product plugs throughout the film. His interactions with Tangaballi as he mocks and pokes him throughout the film are fun to watch. There is so much spring in the overacting that it is hard not to like the performance. Loved his banter with the little person- amazing fun. During the entire film he makes fun of his own movies in a way that is hilarious. I hope he continues to work with other directors who have a sense of commercial cinema as well as Shetty. I hope his next film Happy New Year continues to take him higher. Hate SRK or Love him- You will enjoy this one.and finally ""dont underestimate the power of this Khan""

Deepika Padukone, the heir apparent to Katrina Kaif delivers yet another performance which assures her a shot of being the next number one actress. Another scene that I laughed was her take off on Vidya Balans act in Bhool Bhoolaiya or her Sauchalay song in the train.

Rohit Shetty marries his sense of entertainment with a riot of color and the film is very pretty to look at. Southern India as in Munnar along with Wai and Goa looks gorgeous. He can't restrain himself enough though as he does resort to flying and exploding cars towards the end. The film's story is not path breaking but it is the narrative that keeps us engrossed. Rohit Shetty has all the skill to become a worthy successor to Manmohan Desai.

Vishal Shekhar's music is good but not great. I liked Kashmir Main and the final Lungi Dance tribute to Rajnikanth- fun ( Honey Singh composed this one though)

I immensely enjoyed Chennai Express, notwithstanding the front row seat. It is a fun, fun, filled film which spoofs many films all done with style and a flavor for which Rohit Shetty is capable of. My views are echoed by the thousands of people around the world and India who have watched it and made it the highest opening for any Indian film ever. Just loved it and will watch it again. 5 stars. 8/9/2013",1383523200,,4489,4.448359659781288

The plot of this romantic comedy is an well-worn one, and isn't particularly freshened by the chemistry of Padukone and Khan, but it's still a fun movie with a good message: ""never underestimate the power of the common man"".  Khan and Padukone give good performances with both the humorous and serious scenes. The music is solidly fine, with one exceptionally beautiful song (""Titli"").  Padukone's costumes are gorgeous throughout the film.  Despite it's predictability, it's typical enjoyable Bollywood, and would make a good introduction to those not familiar with the genre.",1521244800,,849,5.2592592592592595
