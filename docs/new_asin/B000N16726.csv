8173847,3,B000N16726,"Soon after being released from prison, a con man and master of disguise (Jean Paul Belmondo) goes back to his old ways, namely selling things (like homes and boats among other things) that don't belong to him. But when the new social worker (Genevieve Bujold) assigned to him catches his fancy, it puts a crimp in his criminal activities. In the 1960s, the comedies of Philippe De Broca found great favor with art house audiences with films like THAT MAN FROM RIO and KING OF HEARTS (THE DEVIL BY THE TAIL is a personal favorite). But he seems to have fallen out of fashion in recent years. L'INCORRIGIBLE is a frantic farce that gets a boost from Belmondo's energetic performance and Bujold's engaging presence but it's never as funny as it seems to think it is and more than once I wished Blake Edwards would come just take it over. The melodic score is by Georges Delerue. With Capucine (who isn't given enough to do), Andrea Ferreol and Daniel Ceccaldi.

The French DVD from Studio Canal is in anamorphic wide screen (1.66) in either French, English and Spanish language versions. There are no subtitles of any kind.",1355011200,,1120,4.685279187817259
