6396226,2,B00JWZUIZG,i expected more from the film. it was watchable and that is about all i can say.,1409788800,,80,3.764705882352941
6396227,1,B00JWZUIZG,"Didn't like it, confusing conversations just not a good flow of character content.",1408752000,,82,5.384615384615385
6396228,4,B00JWZUIZG,I enjoyed this movie though it was a little hard to follow. My friend is cousin to one of the actresses and everyone in the film is a novice to my knowledge. Based on this premise the acting is well done. The movie does hiccup on what exactly it is meant to convey. I am not really sure what some of the relationships are supposed to convey but movie was enjoyable nonetheless.,1407974400,3,377,4.25
6396229,4,B00JWZUIZG,This film is going to require the viewer to pay attention. It helps a little to read the synopsis of what the film is about because it doesn't go out of its way to explain what the main character is doing in Iowa up front. I thought it was pretty good. There are some points where you are left to insert your own imagination of what the characters are thinking while there is no dialogue. If you are not paying attention to what is going on then it can become disjointed during those times. It was worth the rental if you are into films that require viewer engagement.,1407456000,4,568,4.268518518518518

6396233,3,B00JWZUIZG,There seemed to be a huge disconnect between the reason that chick was there doing what she was doing (maybe doing we never saw her do any of it ) and the life she was actually living while there. I'm confused as to what the story was actually about.,1476576000,,250,4.122448979591836

6396235,4,B00JWZUIZG,"This was an enjoyable film.  The acting was surprisingly good and it was emotionally stimulating for me.  It's a story about a young girl still exploring her sexuality and she runs into a few characters along the way, some good, some not so good.  You wouldn't be wasting your time watching this.",1472515200,3,296,4.653846153846154

6396245,2,B00JWZUIZG,I never could figure out what it was supposed to be about.  Took me a week to get thru this thing because I kept falling asleep after a watching for 10 - 15 minutes.,1439078400,2,165,3.8529411764705883

6396250,4,B00JWZUIZG,"What a sweet film.  Excellent acting, beautifully written, sparse poetic flow.  Realistic girl/girl early relation dynamics.  Well worth renting.",1414886400,2,145,6.526315789473684
6396251,5,B00JWZUIZG,This one hits home to me Cat Smits plays her role very well not real keen on the ending Jennifer in the movie is great it is like the role is written for her.. All of the rest are like typical ppl in Iowa . The documentary shots are great  the suicide rate is to high.,1412812800,,268,3.7857142857142856
8654326,4,B00JWZUIZG,"I wasn't going to rate it, but when I read the reviews, I was disappointed and thought to jump in...I really like it. True, it is slow and at times, needs a few lines of script (especially  after Jennifer's 4 minutes teary eyed monologue), but there is softness that is really pleasing. The title could have been Bumble Love and be closer to the actual emotions.",1512086400,,362,4.484848484848484
8654327,5,B00JWZUIZG,"This rating doesn't do justice by this film. The simplicity of the film and emotional connection are perfect. Not to mention its a film that sheds light on an important current issue. (If you end up here for some reason, definitely give it a go)",1499817600,,245,4.466666666666667
8654328,2,B00JWZUIZG,"I really wanted to give it more stars but it was very hard not to fall asleep or at the very least lose a bit of interest in the story. I don't mind movies that move slow but this moved VERY slowly. It's worth a watch if you have nothing else to do. I didn't hate it, it had a lot of potential but so many empty scenes were dragged out while the ones they should have spent more time on were rushed. Not the worst movie I have seen though.",1499472000,,439,3.8351648351648353

8654332,5,B00JWZUIZG,Interesting film. This French woman who went to school with an male American who committed suicide comes to America to visit his grave and make a documentary about him and anyone in the lgbtq community and ends up falling a lesbian herself,1482019200,,239,4.714285714285714
