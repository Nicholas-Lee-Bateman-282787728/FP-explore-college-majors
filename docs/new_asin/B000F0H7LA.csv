8116040,5,B000F0H7LA,"This is yet again another top 80's horror, a very rare and underrated film, a must for anyone into this genre of movies, the story is about a biker gang leader who is executed for the murder of a girls sister, and days later his grave is empty and the killing begins again, a mysterious biker dressed in black is knocking off all the young drunk spring breakers one at a time, the movie has a very typical 80's ending and there are some very cool kills, the killers favourite means of dispatching someone is electrocution or burning so there are some interesting melting and burning effects. The Italian import is full English as it was made with English speaking actors, there are not really any features though, great film a must pick up for 80's horror fans!!!",1382313600,2,763,4.536231884057971
