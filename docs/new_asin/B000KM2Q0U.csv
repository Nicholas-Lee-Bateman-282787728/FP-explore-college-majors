8158150,5,B000KM2Q0U,"OK, it's not as good as being there.  But if you like the sound of surf, this is for you.  I use the CD when I go to sleep.  I close my eyes and picture the crashing of waves on rocks.  I've never gotten to the second track, because I fall sleep.  I particularly like the fact that there is NO subliminal messaging, and no music.  Just natural surf.",1255564800,2,349,3.9855072463768115
8158151,2,B000KM2Q0U,I am looking for waves where the swells are the focus and the scenery changes some.  This DVD kept the same scene and it at an angle.  It was not close and personally involving for me.,1203724800,6,184,4.083333333333333
8158152,1,B000KM2Q0U,This product is 60 minutes of one scene - waves coming over rocks. I am very disappointed. Camera never moves.,1201651200,5,110,4.55
8158153,2,B000KM2Q0U,"I really didn't feel that the quality of either the sound or the video was worth the purchase.  The entire thing seemed quite amateurish to me.  It's a wonderful idea, however.",1199145600,,176,4.645161290322581
8158154,5,B000KM2Q0U,"If I can't actually be relaxing along the ocean, which is pretty hard to do here in Minnesota, then the next best choice is relaxing where ever I'm at with ""Ocean - Relaxation on Demand DVD - Big Sur in Central Coast California"" playing in the background.

Pop in the video, and it will transform the cool wind blowing through your windows into a warm, salty ocean breeze. The director skillfully manages to transport you from where ever you might be clear across the globe to the beaches of central California - and does so without any annoying menus or other interruptions you'll find in other ""relaxation"" DVDs.

For a peaceful background sound during dinner, or a calming visual break during an especially hectic afternoon, you can't go wrong with ""Ocean"".",1189987200,3,760,4.793893129770993
8158155,5,B000KM2Q0U,"The benefits of this DVD is that it heals.  Absolutely!  No menu, no distracting music, no shifting scenes - it allows you to relax & be peaceful as if you are actualy at Big Sur. Really!  While working, I am less stressed w/the waves in the background, & with company, everyone finds it really sets the mood! (Even blocks out the noise of an overdone neighbor!)  So many ways to enjoy this DVD, and it plays continuously - how great is that - like the ocean....it's constant rhythmic motion - so wonderfully beautiful & unending. My compliments - well done, to someone who is aware!  While I am purchasing the ""Ocean & River Relaxation"" DVD, I look forward to others.",1186531200,6,668,4.533333333333333
8158156,5,B000KM2Q0U,"When you view this DVD you will feel you are in paradise. It is
fantastic. It goes continuously until you turn it off. All you hear is the waves crashing and the most beautiful oceanic views you will ever see.
It is the most relaxing thing I have ever used. I just hope that whoever
did this DVD will continue to do alot more DVD,s like this.",1185580800,5,342,4.119402985074627
8158157,5,B000KM2Q0U,"This DVD is not cheesy, unlike so many others nature relaxation titles.  I am suggesting this to a restaurant owner I know to replace his usual poorly-chosen sports-bar channels!  It is amazing that something simple like this can totally change the vibe of a public place.",1164153600,5,272,4.891304347826087
