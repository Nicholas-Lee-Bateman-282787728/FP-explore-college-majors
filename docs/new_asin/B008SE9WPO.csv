5181750,5,B008SE9WPO,"Just a couple of days after doing what I now lovingly call ""My Mirandas"" I could tell a difference in my entire body! I sit at a 12 hour day job all week and I feel my body is scrunched all the time. These stretches worked every tight muscle I have. I feel younger, sexier, and more in control of my body!",1379808000,3,305,3.935483870967742
5181751,5,B008SE9WPO,"I have watched some of Miranda Esmonde's classes on PBS and decided to purchase this series of hers. It has stretching for every part of your body. Being a 50 year old Accountant I needed something that would stretch out my tight muscles and not leave me hurting; I feel better every time I do one of the 30 workouts in this series. Plus the fact that they are a little over 20 minutes each is perfect for me. Sometimes I am able to do a morning and evening one. Or I'll do a stretch and another exercise, but regardless I always do the stretch. She has segments for specific body parts that has also helped when I have injured an area, like I recently did with my ankle. I think it's a fantastic way to get the blood moving in your muscles and start feeling better almost immediately!",1375833600,6,785,4.275167785234899
5181752,5,B008SE9WPO,"We watch Classical Stretch on PBS, and it is the most wonderful stretching program I have done.  I am active, but have never properly stretched, and you won't believe how this helps.
Similar to Tai Chi, which I have never done, but a 23 minute workout which is outstanding.  Both my daughters and their friends do this now, and feel the same way.",1374364800,9,346,4.476190476190476
5181753,1,B008SE9WPO,It had been recommended by a friend and it was I wanted.,1372032000,,56,3.75
5181754,3,B008SE9WPO,"So, this is one of those live and learn moments for me.  I paid $95+ for the 8th season without shopping around as I have found Amazon to have the best prices.  Today I went to the Classical Stretch website and find the price on that web site at $64+ !!!  I'm mad at myself for not looking further....so don't make the same mistake.  Take my advice and shop around.

This was my first time buying one of these and the fact that is said ""Age Defying"" caught my eye.  I have to say, this is the best routine for me.  I LOVE IT.....I only have to commit to 15-20 mins a day and I feel I have had a proper workout after I'm done!",1369353600,35,625,3.952
5181755,5,B008SE9WPO,"I have been a Classical Stretch fan for years. My review is to support this method of exercise, especially Miranda's PBS Series. The Age Defying Series is challenging yet you feel fully stretched and balanced at the end.  I love putting 2 different episodes together for a longer workout. My body has many issues and Classical Stretch is a blessing I use daily. Side NOTE: Many of titles for sale at Amazon are still available at the Classical Stretch site. Please don't be taken in the pocket book by the over pricing here or other sites. I occasionally find them here reasonably priced, but most are just ridiculous. I LOVE this method, but not at these prices!! Beware!",1367193600,60,672,4.694915254237288
5181756,5,B008SE9WPO,"Thexe videos are awesome and 23 minutes long.  You won't believe the improvement in a small amount of time......You will feel prettier, stronger, and more agile.  It is less expensive on miranda's website.",1366156800,51,205,5.181818181818182
5181757,5,B008SE9WPO,"I feel so much better. I have back problems and this really has decreased and balanced my body.  The music tends to be rather loud, but overall the gentle stretching has helped.  I am 56, 30 lbs overweight, and I am at a computer most of the day, so this is perfect for me.",1357948800,39,273,4.037037037037037
5181758,5,B008SE9WPO,"First saw Miranda on TV and loved how she goes about stretching slowly throughout, yet gets every muscle and works the core muscles. You need to do the whole routine, so you aren't sore the next day as I found out with sore quads. I'm 61 and have always done some moderate exercise walking and DVD, but this one is easy to get hooked, on. Will stay with this awhile.",1355616000,58,366,4.242857142857143
5181759,3,B008SE9WPO,These are copies made on USED DVDs.  The title comes up on my screen as a Doris Day DVD.  For $65 I expect better than that.  The work out is good.,1497312000,,147,3.6774193548387095
5181760,5,B008SE9WPO,"I first saw Miranda on pbs.  I had started having severe hip and leg pain, could no longer do even my easiest exercise vidoes and was hobbling around.  I read her book Aging Backwards, then ordered this set of dvds.  I was able to do the exercises every day.  Graduallly my pain went away.  I've been doing 1 of these workouts daily for over 2 years, rarely have any hip, back, or leg pain, or plantar fasciatis I used to have. I am 68, I'm so grateful for this program.",1496448000,2,470,4.177777777777778
5181761,5,B008SE9WPO,DVD arrived in good condition and is very helpful.  I like her approach.,1495756800,,72,4.538461538461538
5181762,5,B008SE9WPO,Used video 20 years ago and this is still the best exercise for me.  Bad back issues 3yrs ago .  This does not hurt and I feel better all over..,1492387200,,144,3.7666666666666666
5181763,5,B008SE9WPO,I use this CD every morning,1485734400,,27,3.6666666666666665

5181765,2,B008SE9WPO,Too muh repetitive exercises. There was no need to get the series.,1483401600,,66,4.583333333333333
5181766,5,B008SE9WPO,"This  dvd has helped relieve my stresses, aches and pains. The stretches are gentle to the body and easy to follow. Some routines target  specific problems- like my frozen shoulder. I am very appreciative of Miranda Esmonde White for producing these videos. They have  helped me tremendously. The classical music  accompaniments are soothing and  the explanations behind the moves incentivize me to keep doing them. Thanks much!",1482796800,,428,5.3283582089552235

5181768,1,B008SE9WPO,Poor picture quality! Wasn't at all what I expected! How do I get a refund. A waste of my money!,1480636800,,96,3.85
5181769,4,B008SE9WPO,"I believe in Classical stretch and what it can do for me. However, I think Miranda moves too quickly at times, with little explanation while moving from one movement to another. I am glad I purchased the DVD's however.",1437177600,3,218,4.615384615384615
5181770,2,B008SE9WPO,"This stretching video seems like it is geared for someone who is more fit than I. I actually re- injured my shoulder on the first episode I tried. I would term this vigorous stretching, not gentle stretching.",1437177600,5,208,4.648648648648648

5181772,5,B008SE9WPO,"I love this set of DVDs. I I have to do is following the instructions on each of the DVD (playing on a TV). In an environment of no rush and comfortable of my home, I am doing it and feeling better everyday.",1437004800,3,207,3.8372093023255816

5181775,3,B008SE9WPO,"Much harder workouts than I expected based on what I saw on Public TV show. I do believe her exercises are beneficial; however, it's up to me to do the work to make Miranda's program work. I am glad I ordered the DVDs, now just need to put them to use.",1436745600,2,252,3.9607843137254903
5181776,5,B008SE9WPO,Remarkable. Really makes a difference. I was having knee and shoulder pain but didn't know why. I thought I needed arthritis medication. My doctor recommended doing these stretches for at least a month to see if it helped. Pleased to report that the knee and shoulder pain are 90% better. Will keep doing these. I don't want to be one of those people who complains about old age and not being able to move around or be as active as they were when they were young. I have always been fit and active and I want to stay that way!,1436659200,2,526,4.27
5181777,5,B008SE9WPO,"This workout has been life-changing for me. I'm in my late 50's but was feeling much older, weak, tired, and stiff. After doing just one short segment every day for a week I started to notice a difference and that made me want to keep going. Now, a few months later, I continue to do one segment a day which lasts usually less than 15 minutes. I don't need special clothing or shoes or a lot of space. My upper body flexibility is amazing now. My legs are stronger and I walk taller because my core is stronger.  Friends have commented on how great I look even though I have lost only 5 lbs.  I know it is because I feel more comfortable in my own body and confident and it shows in the way I carry myself.  Earlier in the summer I was doing some work with boats: climbing ladders, rowing, hauling, and hopping in and out of small craft. Last year I could not have done any of that but this year it was possible all because I have been doing Classical Stretch. The workouts are simple, but not necessarily easy. Nothing is jarring or crazy and it is low impact. You can modify the movements yourself by stretching only as far as you feel comfortable that day. The first few times you do a segment, you may need to stop to see exactly what she is showing you.  Of the dozens of segments on the 4 DVDs, I have done only 10 different ones so I know that the set will keep me going and interested for a very long time. I'm quitting my membership at the gym because this has given me better results than anything else I've tried in years.",1436227200,15,1533,4.186440677966102

8530239,5,B008SE9WPO,"Undeniably the absolute best series of exercises I have ever done.  Miranda Esmonde-White is a genius!  My body is stronger and I am in better shape than  in my 30s and 40s.  I am turning 70 this summer, and I can attest that I am in the best shape I have ever been in.  You can not go wrong with these exercises.  Be sure and get a Doctor's ok.",1525564800,,345,3.927536231884058

8530242,5,B008SE9WPO,"The DVD set exceeded my expectations.  If you are a beginner, you'll probably find the exercises challenging.  The challenge is well worth it.  I feel better immediately after completing a session and have far greater flexibility.",1506816000,,230,5.333333333333333

It actually does reverse the aging process and give you new life!",1505865600,,243,4.454545454545454

8530247,5,B008SE9WPO,"I have experienced a lot of pain from various parts of my body, and within a couple months of doing her program, Monday-Friday, I definitely felt quite a bit of relief. I have been at it for about 5 months now.  Still have the pain in various places but it has become much more tolerable. Highly recommended for those with severe pain issues and also as prevention of such a state.",1497571200,,381,4.366197183098592
