The best part is listening to the kids talk about the different tricks they do. The little kid Kyle Mack was expecially cute to listen to because he was so young but had so much to say!",1124064000,,301,4.189655172413793
8619778,5,B000AL7BE2,"The action is great - these kids really DO rip!  I showed it to my son and his friends (ages 8-13) and they were glued to the TV.  I wish more producers made clean, quality entertainment like Rod Parmenter!",1123545600,3,206,4.256410256410256
8619779,5,B000AL7BE2,"A friend recommended this DVD to me, because he knew one of the Kids who Rip in the movie. I have three children and so I ordered one for them. When it arrived, my kids put it in immediately, and they (and I) were instantly glued. These kids are amazing!!! I've never seen anything quite like this before. it's fun, funny, educational, and the action shots are jaw dropping. It is really inspiring even for me. It made not only my kids want to get outside and try these sports but my wife and I as well. This movie is awesome and is for the kid in all of us. I've never written any reviews before but I just had to get the word out on this one. Buy Kids who Rip. It's worthwhile purchase.",1122508800,2,688,4.103703703703704
