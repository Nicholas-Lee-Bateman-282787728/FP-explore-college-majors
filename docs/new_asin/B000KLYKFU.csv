8158087,4,B000KLYKFU,"Great idea for a plot. Based on the novel, The Ax, by Donald Westlake, who authored many books, under other names. Some have been remade a few times, like Point Blank, ie. Payback. This one centers around a paper manufacturing executive that is 'downsized' when the factory moves to a cheaper country. Like a good engineer he comes up with an effective plan- kill every top candidate for the job he wants, and kill that guy, too.
Along the way, Westlake's character raises some interesting points about the myth of the Great American Dream in the suburbs and the death of the middle class in the U.S. This is the film Costa-Gavras made in France. Well directed with a sure hand.",1462579200,,678,4.6115702479338845
8158088,5,B000KLYKFU,"I saw this movie the year it came out, about 10 years ago. I found it hilarious, subversive, well acted and very well directed. I purchased it because I want my friends to see what French cynicism can bring to cinema. :-)",1448323200,,221,4.285714285714286
8158089,5,B000KLYKFU,"Bitter humor, real characters, right to the point! A brutal exposure of our ugly side and the ugliness of the world we live in.",1366934400,,127,4.333333333333333
8158090,4,B000KLYKFU,"An enjoyable movie, despite its implausible/not very promising premise. It'd work fine as a comedy, but it isn't; not quite. It might also have based a sociological/political polemic about how the current world of work makes us all one another's enemies; but, again, it's nothing quite so earnest. Instead, we get both, or something in between, and perhaps works best in this hybridized formulation.

A laid-off executive goes about killing off those who might compete against him for any opportunities in his field. This is the shaky foundation, but the acting is top-rate and things unfold in an extremely well laid out way -- including a few near-chuckles and a couple of scenes that make one ache in the quiet suspense.

You know things are being crafted by the practiced hands of a master with the late introduction of a subplot about illegality elsewhere in the family. It's plausible and adds to the proceedings without shouldering aside the plot.

In any case, we worry about the protagonist, no matter how nasty he really would have to be to leave strewn behind so many cadavers of people so like himself. Costa-Gavras has us asking: how can he possibly end this mess?

Not preposterously, as it turns out, considering that premise. It fits nicely within the protagonist's wonky world that we've consented to peer into.

The actor, Jos Garcia, has the role of a lifetime in this: it's a difficult part to play (again: absent the laughs, or any rending of garments), yet that's what he does - and to a curious degree of perfection. Also watch for the chameleon-like Karin Viard, little known to most outside of French cinema but probably the country's most natural actress today. She's already got an impressive body of work behind her, and is flawless and very engaging in her rather minor role. (How come few Hollywood stars accept small roles in which they can shine, while in their recognized prime?)

Recommended.",1365379200,,1926,4.892638036809816
8158091,5,B000KLYKFU,"Love this movie with it's dark humor and great actors! Hopefully, it will not inspire anyone to follow the hero's example in the movie! How the globalization and the New World Order  is transforming decent and otherwise nice people into predators... somehow, the use of the ""preemptive war"" principle used by the American Empire by a common man. Brilliant!",1363392000,,356,5.033898305084746
8158092,1,B000KLYKFU,The movie was very entertaining.... when it was not freezing on the screen during amazon instant streaming. Not to mention the 5 minute screen black-out in the middle of the show.,1352592000,,179,4.806451612903226
8158093,5,B000KLYKFU,"I love telling people that Russell Crowe recommended this film to me.  It isn't really a lie, more like an exaggeration of the truth.  I follow him on Twitter (so sue me) and he was raving this film a few years back, talking about how Jose Garcia was phenomenal in it.  He got my interest, and considering that the Leading Male category is notoriously my favorite, and Russell Crowe is my favorite current leading man (so I trust his taste level), I had to bite here.

I'm so glad I did.

`Le Couperet' is a very modern take on the film noir.  It isn't as stagey as the classics, and so it breathes with a little more follow-through, much like Curtis's '97 masterpiece, `L.A. Confidential'.  The story told is that of Bruno Davert, a middle-aged business man, married with two children who is very good at what he does.  Despite his loyalty to his company, downsizing and relocation costs him his job.  Two years later he is still unemployed and the economy is at such a low that he can't find any work.  Desperation devises a plan in his head where this otherwise rather sensible man becomes a cold blooded killer, tracking down anyone who stands in his way of getting a plum job in a well-to-do paper company.  Sure, he's nervous but he has to do this.

Perfectly meshing two worlds (it is serious and dark and provocative and yet equally witty and humorous), `Le Couperet' is a gem of a film.  The construction and pacing is splendid, never aching on particulars long enough to become tiresome, but constantly solidifying our attention with its sharp edits and story progression.  And then there is Jose Garcia, who is flawless.  He delivers one of the best performances of the aughts, delving deep inside this man's psyche to find the heart of his newfound chaos.  The way Jose wears each murder on his skin (scrub with soap) is achingly realistic.  He also understands how to shade this performance to find the nuggets of humor and even charm in this everyman-turned-killer.

Costa-Gavras directs a winner here, a film that is sure to entertain as well as provoke.",1319414400,5,2069,4.637362637362638

8158095,5,B000KLYKFU,"THE CORPORATION is an ambitious and demolishing film, that necessarily must be seen under several levels, its dramatic texture is incisive, mordacious and profoundly realist.

Since the first shot until the first word elapse four minutes and twenty six seconds, and the first lines are: ""This is a confession."" Because given these rules of the game, he is just a soldier who defends his trench.

A successful executive is suddenly removed from his job, after fifteen years of devoted service to the enterprise, the high management adduces reduction of costs and that set of commonplaces frequently said in this sort of action.

So, his well deserved status and professional achievements remain into a ""zero atmosphere"" . As you may suppose, after two years of unfruitful efforts, our central character decides to publish a postal code simulating an employment agency, in order to make a zealous analysis around the number of his potential rivals .

Since this decision, he gets his C.V, and decides into his gradually neurotic compulsiveness, to murder them to return his job in absence of competence.

The secondary personages play besides a sinister vision around the surrounding world: his son is a teenager who simply is out of control without INTERNET , his wife is a courageous human being who doesn't care to take two jobs to keep their social position.

Particularly remarkable is the employment of the semiotic language, there is a veiled tribute to Charlot (Monsieur Vedoux) in that smart sequence in which we see an ambulant misemployed imitating to Chaplin, on the other hand the clever allusion to important issues concerning to marketing, but above all is the gradual fragmentation as individuals, of people who simply does not know what to do in such undesirables position in which your social prestige, economical relations and self stem seem to vanish under their feet.

A struggling portrait of a contemporary and beating actuality. How to deal with this transition state?

Powerful, incisive, brilliant and demolishing approach around an issue that frequently tend to overlook, ignoring it or simply making new friends.",1188691200,,2138,5.176811594202898
