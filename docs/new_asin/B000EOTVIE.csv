The protagonist is a charming and humble man, and the rest of the cast is an interesting mix that create a warm impression of a rural village you could find just about anywhere.  I recommend it, but make sure you are in a patient mood when you begin watching.  You won't feel sorry you watched it at all.",1335398400,,469,4.306818181818182
8228541,5,B000EOTVIE,"This movie is a so far rare narration of how long distance cycling records are set in a setting (sic!). Personally I loved the first part since I have worked in a slaughterhouse and carried meat as is done there. The rest of the movie is a treat also, showing the need for comrade support (i.e. crew and sponsors) and the suffering and rewards of attempting to go the distance and succeed in the attempt. I recommend, especially for people interested in ultra marathon cycling.",1297036800,,477,4.623529411764705
