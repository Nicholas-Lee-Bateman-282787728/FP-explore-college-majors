8738673,5,B00KVP3ZRY,This documentary is great for those who are looking for more insight and views on how relationships work.  Thinking I knew it all Love's Journey really made me take a second look at the way some things work and really opened my mind to viewing relationships differently.  Great perspectives from the more acknowledged  people interviewed as well as the everyday people like you and I.,1402617600,,384,4.876923076923077
8738674,5,B00KVP3ZRY,"Loves Journey is a veritable treat for the heart and mind. Rick Bechard took an elusive yet familiar topic and rendered it enlightening and thought provoking. The various interviews with professionals, a clergyman and everyday people give a brilliant overview of diverse thinking and understanding on what it means to fall in love, or to be in love. I applaud Rick Bechard on having produced this wonderful and inspiring documentary. I particularly applaud him for having had the foresight to interview the Dr. Ken Wapnick, clinical psychologist and teacher of A Course in Miracles. Dr. Wapnicks commentary and in-depth understanding of human nature and spirituality cannot but touch one deeply about the psychological motivation behind seeking love, and its true meaning in our lives. Mylene DAstous, sexologist, gives some practical and sensitive, down-to-earth ways of dealing with everyday issues in love relationships. Rev. Monsignor Peter Riani, for his part, gives a more traditional but loving view on love and relationships. My first reaction after viewing this film was I want more! I sincerely hope there is a Part II. I recommend buying this film highly. Thank you Rick Bechard!",1402444800,,1190,5.301587301587301
