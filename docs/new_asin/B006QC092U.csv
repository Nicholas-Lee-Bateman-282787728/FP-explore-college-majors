8502974,3,B006QC092U,"There's simply not enough on the DVD.  He takes entirely too long to explain something that could be taught in 2 minutes, and then move on to the next pattern. He completely ignores the preps which are required to lead the patterns, but at least he shows them if you already know what to look for. And then at the end of the DVD he goes into a much higher level pattern that is worthless to the student at this point in their training.",1423612800,,435,4.178571428571429
8502975,3,B006QC092U,"It was ok, there was some material that was interesting. But I have been dancing WCS for almost three years and for the price I was expecting a whole lot more. If I paid half the price, my review would have been better.",1400716800,,219,4.116279069767442
8502976,5,B006QC092U,"We followed up Shawn's beginner DVD with this one and it really did take our dance to the next level.  I was immediately glad to see that they did not spend half the DVD going over the basics again, instead, they get right into the moves.  We especially liked the wrap covered on this DVD but will also be utilizing all the moves covered in our WCS quiver! 5 Stars for sure!",1398643200,,374,4.180555555555555
8502977,5,B006QC092U,"As I mentioned in my review of West Coast Swing ""101"" (2011) Shawn and JoAnna's grasp of what the student needs first as fundamentals and then as they progress is fantastic.  I can't even get this by going to so called ""private lessons"" where a half hour lesson is costing upwards of $50-95.  This Volume is completely broken down into six step foot patterns.  It builds on the 101 DVD as they put more emphasis on the ""cool"" looking turns and passes.  But once again they do stress you must understand the basic's first.... even when I go to dance lessons with various instructors they have you going through sophisticated moves to quickly... I guess they figure the students will get bored with the basic footwork, however the fundamentals are key before any of these moves.

Shawn and JoAnna do an excellent job of taking their time and explaining and demonstrating each of the patterns and moves and break them down so each one builds on the previous.  Once again I am not a competitive dancer, however by watching and emulating Shawn's body movement with the patterns and his footwork you can only get better and better.  But like everything else in life that you would like to accomplish YOU MUST PRACTICE .... you can't just sit back and absorb it... that won't happen.

So get up and get going... purchase their products, focus and have fun, as they do by dancing the night away !!!!  And if you have trouble they even have a toll free number for which you can call... and they do answer or call you back if you have difficulty with any of the instruction.... and to boot they are very sincere and pleasant on the phone.",1384473600,2,1628,4.5479452054794525
8502978,5,B006QC092U,"I am not new to West Coast Swing but I am certainly not an expert. I thoroughly enjoyed the light-hearted (they have FUN teaching) and informative DVD Moves and Patterns Vol. 1, and look forward to the rest of the series. If you have already gone through beginner DVD's or classes, this it a good next choice. One of my favorite parts was at the beginning where you learn how to start a dance without being arms-distance apart.

Shawn and Joanna Trautman explain the moves completely, and show close-ups of both hands and feet so you get a good snapshot of what you should look like doing the moves. I have also been lucky enough to attend more than one of his live classes, and even dance with Shawn Trautman personally. He is just as patient and fun to dance with in person as he is on the DVD!",1363996800,2,796,4.342281879194631
8502979,3,B006QC092U,I am new to West Coast Swing and dance and I find the movements were hard to follow.  I need something a with a little more explanation.,1361318400,,136,4.037037037037037
