5360942,5,B009Q6F6JY,this was the final dvd to my saiyuki collection. I loved it. the disc was perfect and played beautifully. thanks.,1388966400,,113,4.7
5360943,1,B009Q6F6JY,"I have been a Saiyuki fan for years since the first mangas were in stores and was obsessed with the series. I have read, reread, watched and rewatched everything. I was looking forward to adding this movie to my collection, but when I finally got it I found out how terrible it actually was. Yes it's a complete overview (emphasizes on overview) of what happen to the characters in their past lives, but that literally is all. The story makes little to no sense unless you know the story by heart. It skips huge portions of what happened and no real understanding of who the people are and what exactly happened between Goku and the other people of Heaven. It's very heard to follow and I'm annoyed that everyone is giving it a 5 star review simply because they find out how Goku ended up trapped on the mountain.  It was as if they took every cut scene you catch in the series and put them together with no plot, no correlation, nothing at all. If you want a truer understanding of what happened I recommend reading the manga or watching the series both give the same thing without skipping from one idea to the next. This was POORLY done and an insult to any fan who watches it.",1385510400,5,1180,4.3881278538812785
5360944,5,B009Q6F6JY,"Well, when I first watched it after receiving it in the mail, I was a little surprised on how the events took place. I was especially surprised when my favorite character's past selves died. It took a while to get used to, but after a couple weeks it just got better and made sense. I of course, love it. I give it a full 5 stars. I would really recommend this DVD to anyone who is a true Saiyuki fan.",1376006400,,401,4.025
5360945,5,B009Q6F6JY,I wanted more maybe they will finish this series one day soon. This is the pre-cue to the Sanzo party story .,1375833600,,109,4.0
5360946,5,B009Q6F6JY,"I loved Saiyuki, especially the second season. I had so many questions about why the four guys were kicked out of heaven and why Goku was treated so harshly that I read the manga. You really need to have seen at least the second season of Saiyuki to get the full story because Gaiden passes through that part quickly though it follows the manga very closely and gives the full flavor if not all the details. Having read the story, I was prepared for the violence and blood but it is as it should be and the end is poignant and sad. Saiyuki Gaiden is a much deeper story than one might think about the price of freedom. Now if only there was an OVA of the story about how Goku and Gojyo got their distinctive weapons. It was funny.",1364083200,,730,4.2214285714285715
5360947,5,B009Q6F6JY,"I was waiting for this video.  Yes! My favorite serie. Very good graphic quality. The story is condensed.  They try to make a serie of 4 hours in less, so you have to undertand the tale to enjoy.

Warning: that if you have not seen before the series, it is very hard to understand.

It is the past life before reincarnating in the life of the original story of the trip. In seeking to make history in a short time, you lose the connection between the main and secondary characters. I'm sure many are eager to see from where the bond between them. It's a shame that the story of the OVA does not lack action and blood but is lacking of narration of why.

All action, Yes!
Not have a tale, Bad! You need to read the Manga to really undertand what is happening.",1362960000,,758,4.2
5360948,5,B009Q6F6JY,"I am in love with the saiyuki !! greaat animation !!! I would tell anyone to go head invest in this saiyuki series, it is very entertaining.. people who are into Japanese animation will truly enjoy this animation!!!!!!!!",1360800000,,220,4.815789473684211
5360949,5,B009Q6F6JY,"If your a fan of kazuya Minekura this series will not disappoint you. The story is Pre-sequel to Genzomaden Saiyuki. Its beautifully done and the dubs it really well. They got all the original voice actors from Gensomaden Saiyuki , Saiyuki Re load and saiyuki re load gunlock.",1360195200,,276,4.770833333333333
5360950,5,B009Q6F6JY,"I've been waiting for years for this part of the story to come out and it was well worth the wait.  For those who have not seen the previous volumes of the story I agree that it will make more sense if you watched them first before viewing this OVA.

Be aware though that there is a lot of blood and gore during the fight scenes and there is some profanity so I do not recommend that children watch this.

As a long time fan I was moved to tears at the ending.  It did answer my questions about their previous lives and how Goku ended up in the mountain top prison cave with his memory erased.",1359590400,2,593,4.042735042735043
5360951,4,B009Q6F6JY,"First off, if you aren't familiar with Saiyuki, then you may wish to begin elsewhere. This story starts off assuming you already know who the characters are and what their relationship is to one another. If you're curious, by all means please read the Saiyuki manga or watch seasons 1 and/or 2 of the anime. Then swing back here and get this DVD, because it's a treat.

For people familiar with the story...

This is the Gaiden (""heaven"") arc of Saiyuki. It starts off a little after season 2 of the anime series.

Since this anime could only be 3 episodes long, the writers crammed the first two volumes of the Gaiden manga into the first 20 minutes of the series. Episode 1 is extremely fast paced and would truly be disorientating if you have not already read the first two volumes of the Gaiden manga or finished season 2 of the anime. It's more of less a highlight reel of the ""best"" moments in Gaiden volumes 1 and 2. After episode 1, the paces slows down a bit and the characters are given the time to be ""fleshed out"" and the story becomes easy to follow, even if you haven't read past volume 2 of Gaiden.

I remember years ago when I first read Saiyuki, I wondered how Goku wound up in the isolated cave on top of the mountain. Why was his memory erased and how did his friends perish? This series answers ALL of the questions that you might have about the character's time in Gaiden. And it does it well. The hyper-paced episode 1 is easily forgiven when you realize that the writers wanted to save time to do the climax RIGHT. The climax. I wish I was a good enough writer to describe how powerful it was. If you are a Saiyuki fan, please get the DVD and watch it. You will be moved.

The anime's visuals are nowhere near the quality of, let's say Bakemonogatari or Madoka, but they are striking none-the-less. The colors and character and background designs are faithful to Minekura's compositions, and so, even if things don't move a lot, they are still captivating to look at. The music is also lovely. The only extras included are a clean opening and closing credit sequence. You also get some Sentai previews.

As far as the dub, they got the original ADV crew to do the voices. Although I REALLY appreciate that Sentai did this, I thought the performances were extremely flat. Also, some of the characters sounded too much alike (like Hakkai and Goujun). If you don't mind subtitles, I STRONGLY recommend you listen to the original Japanese voice actors. They add so many nuances that, for whatever reason, the American actors just don't get.

Also, a fair warning to the squeamish. This story has lots of blood, guts, and a high body count. If you are easily disturbed with violent images, then you may want to avoid this one (or just close your eyes when a sword gets drawn).

If you are a Saiyuki fan, I strongly recommend you get this DVD. Not only does it tell a great story, but it lets American publishers know that there's still an interest in the Saiyuki series. I would love to see Sentai pick up the Burial OVAs or a publisher release the Gaiden manga.",1357948800,21,3080,4.467971530249111

8543724,5,B009Q6F6JY,Very graphic but it does help explain what when on before the main series started.,1484006400,,82,4.533333333333333

8543726,2,B009Q6F6JY,"First, let me say I'm a huge fan of the series, for the mythology and the storyline that was started but, regretfully, not finished.

The backstory of the characters, as presented in the original series, was fascinating. I looked forward to seeing that story fleshed out more. That is not what this ""series"" gave me.

First, the artwork was *incredibly* rough, with most of the characters looking nothing like they did in the original series. The look is primitive--more like a rough draft than a finished product. Having just recently finished rewatching the originals, this took a lot of getting used to.

Second, this is less a ""series"" than it is one story told from three different points of view. This DVD may run 90 minutes, but you're not getting anything like 90 minutes worth of story development. Repeating the same storyline (such as it was) from three points of view made it repetitive--never has a DVD felt so unending.  I kept waiting for them to finish ""recapping"" and get on with the story--but it didn't, at least not before the last 5-10 minutes at the end of the DVD.

Third, the ""story"" runs more like we're seeing the climactic scenes of a long-developing situation. We don't get much in the way of lead-up or development. There are a few scenes to set the story but this is mostly their final battle to get to the portal to earth, told from the POV of each of the older characters.

Overall, I found it unsatisfying. It lacks the subtlety and the emotional complexity that our original glimpses of these backstory characters offered. They would have done better to pull out the Heaven scenes from the original series and add storyline developments to those. That would, at least, have been related to the original series.

This DVD, though--it seems almost entirely unrelated to the original. If it was based off of more recent developments, in the comic, then maybe it should have been advertised as a comic tie-in, and not as an anime tie-in. (I'm assuming that the new elements introduced are something that appears in the comic.)

I'm sort of sorry I bought it, in spite of being a huge fan of the series. It wasn't the story I was hoping to get. I rewatch all of the originals occasionally. I can't quite imagine ever rewatching this one.",1425513600,6,2266,4.690176322418136
8543727,5,B009Q6F6JY,"As always, AWESOME!",1422403200,,19,5.666666666666667
8543728,2,B009Q6F6JY,"I hate to rate this so poorly since I am a huge fan of Saiyuki. I am in the minority, but I really enjoyed ADV's dub of the original Saiyuki series, and lost interest in Reload/Gunlock due to the change in art, voice-acting (dub) and characterizations. When I heard that this was going to be released featuring the ""ancient past"" characters, whose appearances I greatly enjoyed in the original series, as well as the the original ADV voice acting, I was very excited. Unfortunately, what we got wasn't really up to par.

I haven't read the Saiyuki Gaiden comics that these are based on, but I have seen the 3 episodes that cover their story-arc from the original series. However, instead of picking up where those stories left off, the first of the three episodes on the disc starts with a massive flashback that crams lots of information into a short amount of time. It's disconnected and jumbled, and it was hard to tell when the ""flachback"" stopped and when the actual episode began. The story is basically such that the four heroes have decided heaven is corrupt, and they want to escape.

The characterizations seemed a little off to me. Saiyuki has always been a very ""bro-mantic"" type series, but sometimes the relationships and dialogue between the characters was a bit over-the-top, particularly between Konzen and Goku. It was also hard to feel invested in the story because I feel like we as the audience are just thrown into the climax of a bigger movie. The battle scenes are fun and well-animated, although the foursome are doomed from the start (which anyone familiar with who the characters are should know) so throughout the episodes they slowly are picked off or sacrifice themselves so the others can continue trying to escape.

Overall, it was fun to see the characters brought to life again and it was an extra treat to have the original dub cast back, but the story was just a little too disjointed to really enjoy, and the characterizations struck me as off. I don't think I'll be watching this movie again, even though the artwork and animation is lovely and I really enjoy the ""ancient past"" characters that we rarely got to see from the original series. I'd reccomend this to hardcore Saiyuki fans only, and only as a rental.",1403049600,5,2251,4.7226463104325695
8543729,5,B009Q6F6JY,I chose this rating because I think everything went as it should. The DVD was prompt to appear and there was no damage to it. I'm really happy with my purchase,1393891200,,159,4.161290322580645
8543730,5,B009Q6F6JY,"Someone I knew, got me into this series. I love it. Sanzo, and Goyjo are my favorite characters. I would recommend this anime to people.",1393372800,,136,4.48
8543731,4,B009Q6F6JY,"I saw Saiyuki Gaiden long before I encountered the Saiyuki series.  The plot can be somewhat confusing if you don't have the backstory, but anyone can catch on quickly to what is going on.  Loved the character growth and development.  Not to give anything away for someone who does not know the story, but it will break your heart and the ending is so worth it.",1392940800,,361,4.4393939393939394
