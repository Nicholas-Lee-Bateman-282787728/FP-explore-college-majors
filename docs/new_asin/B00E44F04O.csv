Hot Toasty Rag, October 22, 2017

In this made-for-television flick, Stockard Channing plays a no-good, selfish, pathological liar with a rap sheet longer than her arm. Her current fixation is stealing cars, so that she can sell them and hopefully get enough money to actually buy a Ferrari. Beyond that, she has absolutely no life plan. Shes not thinking of getting a legitimate job, an apartment or house, a quality boyfriend, or even a bath. What a great heroine to root for.

For some reason that never becomes clear, her young, trusting public defenderplayed by Sam Waterston, who else?tells the judge to be lenient because shes a good kid and just needs a little guidance. He continually sticks up for her and tries to help her, even though she proves time and again she has neither the interest nor the tools to fully accept his help. Shes incredibly unlikable, and its very frustrating to watch her drag Sam down with her, especially for fans who know him on Law & Order. Unless you really love Stockard ChanningI dont; shes just too angry-looking all the timeyoull probably want to load up on your Jack McCoy fix the way nature intended, with a Law & Order marathon.",1508630400,2,1199,4.732057416267943
