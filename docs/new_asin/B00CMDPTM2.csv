5726712,3,B00CMDPTM2,"There are 12 movies that feature various good martial artist e.g. Jet Li, Carter Wong, Lo Lieh etc. However, some of the story lines and production are very poor. Other story lines were okay yet, lacked good direction, then again you had poor martial arts direction. If you are a collector of martial arts movies this maybe a must have. However, if you are looking for good movies -its a hit and miss. I would give it 5 or 6 out of 10; and no more. I purchased it because it had a couple of movies I didn't have already. Once again be careful as you may know with many older Chinese films they have multiple names for the same movie and you just maybe buying a movie you already have.",1378771200,9,684,4.229007633587786

5726714,4,B00CMDPTM2,"This 3 disc compilation is from Mill Creek.  The movies are in dubbed English; i didn't find any alternate audio or subtitles.  The quality is what you would expect from a Mill Creek package; the films are not restored or remastered.  Most are watchable as far as image. Some are full screen cropped (but not too badly in most cases) and some appear to be widescreen transfers.  The widescreen movies are slightly better image quality overall.  These are older movies mostly from the late seventies and early eighties so don't expect anything more than that.

 None of these are rare finds but there is some good action in most of them.  Story and action quality ranges from occasionally silly (Dynamite Shaolin Heroes directed by Godfrey Ho (aka Tomas Tang or Walter Lee in the credits here) to not bad (Fist From Shaolin, a poor man's OUATIC).

Overall this is a good value for the money at under $10.  YMMV. I don't think any of these are in the larger Mill Creek 50 movie set of martial arts movies although some might be listed under alternate titles in the set.  I give the collection 4 stars for cheap, fun entertainment but only for collectors and fans of the genre and era.

The titles included are as follows:

Dynamite Shaolin Heroes (1977) Fullscreen

Shaolin Invincible Guys (1978) Fullscreen

The Cavalier (1978) Fullscreen

18 Shaolin Riders (1980)

Stranger from Shaolin(1981) Widescreen

Shaolin Kung Fu (1974) Widescreen

Fist From Shaolin (1993) Fullscreen

Shaolin Brothers (1977) Fullscreen

Rebel Of Shaolin (1977) Fullscreen

Shaolin Death Squad (1977) Widescreen

Shaolin Super Dragon (1982) Fullscreen

The Magnificent (1979) Fullscreen",1371772800,38,1661,5.044280442804428

5726726,4,B00CMDPTM2,"Of the 4 movie compilations that mill creek entertainment released, Flying Fists Of Kungfu and Kickin It Shaolin Style are the best 2. On the KISS compilation, of the 12 movies, the only 2 bad ones are 18 Shoalin Riders( which looked like some scenes were cut) and Shoalin Brothers imo. I guess you can complain when your getting 12 movies for such a cheap price. Don't expect anything special like trailers because you won't get them. All the movies are vhs quality in both picture and sound but it doesn't matter because the movies are action packed . And when it comes to these types of movies, that's all that counts.",1431907200,3,621,4.553571428571429
