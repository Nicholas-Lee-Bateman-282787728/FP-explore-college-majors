My personal sports and fight hero was Mike Tyson. I hated him. He was an animal. We stayed up all night and he made the show in 2 minutes maximum.",1325116800,2,288,3.816666666666667

644426,3,6303444326,"The main actor does a good job of portraying Mike, the story quickly shows main people in Tysons life but I felt that the story does not give an insight on the complex personality from the pigeon loving guy to the short fused temper. Also no clue how he began as a boxer.",1482883200,,271,4.132075471698113

644647,5,6303444326,"Great casting and great writing highlighted this remarkable adaptation of Mike Tyson's life. At one time he was unbeatable but it all began to end for him 25 years ago when James ""Buster"" Douglass destroyed Tyson in the ring. The referee may have had something to do with that. He counted too long for Buster Douglass while counting fast for Mike Tyson. This upset was the death knell of heavyweight boxing. It would never be the same again as the belts and classes were all thrown into chaos after Tyson's loss to Douglass and his prison sentence two years later.

Michael Jai White's performance was fantastic. He looked and sounded like Mike Tyson and the youngster no doubt prepared for this role with great precision. The actor they got for Kevin Rooney was also a great lookalike. I'll go into George C. Scott later.

Tyson made many mistakes. He fired Kevin Rooney and he hooked up with Don King, who may or may not have stolen from him. Then he used his fame to pursue Desiree Washington. He should never have taken that woman to his room. Women are dangerous to men with fame power. Nothing good happens when a man has casual sex with a woman. At worst he should have gotten a call girl.

This film takes us up to the night in question but it makes no judgment as to the guilt or innocence of either party which I liked. That showed that the writers and producers wanted to be fair with the subject matter. I want to add how great the late great George C. Scott was as Cus D' Amato! He was a great man and helped to mold Mike Tyson. It's fair to say that Cus's death began Tyson's spiral downwards. But it was Jimmy's death that solidified his descent into moral turpitude.

I give this HBO original film a Four and a Half Star rating.

anyone back then though. we all know Tysons  ko record. but  never the less white gives an awesome performance and brings out a good

644816,4,6303444326,"I would watch this again but it will be a while, and primarily only because Michael Jae White is in it. Interesting what a different point of view makes the breakup of the marriage of Tyson and what's-her-name look like. Previously I had only heard things from her point of view and what a monster Tyson was, believable because of his in-the-ring persona.  I also did not realize he was so young when he achieved his fame and success.",1415836800,,434,4.493670886075949

644918,4,6303444326,"In short, they found a really good actor to play Tyson, and George C. Scott needs no introduction.  The casting was great. The story was really good. However, I think to really capture Tyson, they should have made this film three hours, and should have used real footage at times to better illustrate his life. So much was left out especially in the relationship with Tyson and Cus,  lost interviews with them, not enough with his childhood, or why he went to jail, what lead up to it, what he was like before jail as a person and as a fighter, how he ended up firing everyone who really cared about him and got him there, and then ended up in court with Don King for stealing from him.  So much they could have done with this movie. However, they did capture some highlights of important event in his life, his wife early on, junior Olympics, post Cus death, and eventually his demise.  And now thanks to his change in behavior, being away from the game, maturing, not being around the people who used him,  Spike Lee's direction of Tyson's one man show on stage, and appearing on Howard Stern, and other normal Hollywood events, Tyson appears to be more human and approachable and since this came late it is obviously not in the film.  If you don't know much about Tyson, this is a great movie for you to get started with.  They did a fine job, I just think they could have done much more.  But they did a decent job of the timeline of his life  up to the point this movie was made, and showed the more human side of Tyson when he was a very young man and teenager.  Great movie for anyone who is interested in the man and the fighter...",1402876800,4,1639,4.309446254071661
