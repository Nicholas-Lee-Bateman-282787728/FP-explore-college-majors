8420613,5,B004AOECV0,I always enjoyed Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition but only have copies in stereophonic sound.  This DVD was an inexpensive way to enjoy this piece in 5.1 surround sound.  Nice performance.,1395619200,,194,5.225806451612903
8420614,5,B004AOECV0,"I loved this video for several reasons. In addition to the superb performances, the sound reproduction and camera work are excellent. As an educator I use this video to enhance my music literature presentations to senior citizens. It is the next best thing to attending the actual performance.",1304380800,4,293,5.125
