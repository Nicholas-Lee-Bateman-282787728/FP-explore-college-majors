The music and the smiling faces bring back memories from their past.  It makes you smile just to watch them (as a family) performing once again.  is a movie you'll never, ever get tired of.  You can watch it over and  over and still sing along every time!",968371200,8,411,4.0625

If you have purchased the DVD ""The Osmonds - Live (1970)"" released in 2006 you don't want to buy this one released in 2000.  It's the same concert - the 2006 DVD is just a re-release.

Then again, if you are a lover of all things Osmond, just like me, why not have both in your collection, right?  After all, the jacket covers have different pictures of the guys on them!!!",1200960000,,581,4.0
7923732,4,B00004U5S7,"I liked this DVD, but it just was way to short! If you really like the osmonds it would be worth it for you, but is you are a casual fan, don't bother.",1128124800,,151,3.606060606060606
7923733,4,B00004U5S7,"As someone who is both a guitarist and familiar with the Osmonds' music, I was afraid that this would turn out to be a lip-synched TV performance--a la American Bandstand.  I was pleased to see that it was a live performance and that all of the guitar solos (with the exception of ""Down by the Lazy River"") were played by Alan and Wayne Osmond.  This was obviously a less than ideal concert situation, as the stage was too small for their dance moves and the microphones were mixed terribly.  You can hardly hear any of their trademark harmonies, except when Donny is singing his solo songs.  Those who wonder whether the Osmonds actually played their instruments will have ample evidence: a (brief) drum solo, some decent guitar playing and several keyboard highlights from Donny.  I might have rated this DVD higher if the sound quality had been better.  Since I know of no other live video of the Osmonds from this time period, I recommend it highly for Osmond fans.",1102550400,4,969,4.670588235294118
7923734,5,B00004U5S7,"This is a must for all Osmond fans - although the dvd is only 47 mins long it brought back all the memories of the Osmonds in the 1970's - from their outfits to Jay performing ""Crazy Horses""- certainly the audience didn't seem very enthusiastic about it but I thoroughly enjoyed the whole thing!!",1052092800,4,296,4.5
7923735,3,B00004U5S7,"Relive your childhood watching this DVD. But don't be mislead by the track length of 47 min. I can't believe Pioneer hasn't changed this to the correct length of 30 min yet. Far too short for a Concert DVD.

7923736,3,B00004U5S7,"As a true Osmond fan, I was just a little disappointed in this DVD.  Although, I found most parts enjoyable.  The way the cover looks I was thinking more of like the concerts I use to attend.  If you a are true die hard Osmond fan you will appreciate this DVD and it will bring back memories of the 1970's.  If you are more of a Donny & Marie fan, this video is not for you.",1009843200,4,374,3.8815789473684212
7923737,5,B00004U5S7,If you love the Osmonds you have to have this video.  They perform all their greatest hits from the days of Tiger Beat and Teen Beat.  Great jumpsuits and dance moves! It will definitely get you to remember your teenage years with a smile.,993600000,9,239,4.409090909090909
7923738,5,B00004U5S7,"I bought this video last December down in Branson at the Osmond Family Theater.  If you are a fan of the Osmonds, you will certainly enjoy this video.  As I watched this tape, the words to every song the Osmonds sang came back to me like I listened to all my Osmond albums yesterday.  It's nice to see Marie on the tape as well.  Donny is still my favorite Osmond Brother.  As you watch this tape, don't be surprised if you start singing along with all the songs.",992908800,4,463,4.215909090909091
7923739,3,B00004U5S7,"I have been a fan of The Osmonds since 1971 and still am 30 years later.  At least a fan of the older albums and music like Crazy Horeses and The Plan.  Both great albums.  However, I was disappointed in this video. I know it was 1972 when this video was done but with todays technology, they could have had this remastered and made it sound better.  I also think this was the time when Donny was reaching puberty because his voice cracked a lot.  I'm sure that couldn't be helped.  I was just disappointed in the overall performance and sound quality of the video.  It didn't sound like the recording on the ""Osmonds Live"" album.  It was worse.  It is good to watch though.  Brings back a lot of memories and I still like the group.  I was just expecting a better performance from the ""One Take Osmonds"" than what I seen on that video.  It does have it's good points to me.  This is the first time I have seen the Osmonds perform for this long of time.  They did some great hits.  Classics!  It was good to finally see a show from the group in their hayday.",992908800,2,1058,4.215
7923740,4,B00004U5S7,"This 1972 tape is only 47 minutes long compared to other concerts tapes being approximately 2 hours. They sing a total of 12 songs. It was more like watching a quick 30 minute T.V. special than a concert. But, it still was The Osmonds and overall I have to say 47 minutes is better than no minutes. I did enjoy the tape and would only recommend it to true die hard Osmond fans.",978825600,7,377,4.178082191780822
