Can someone who bought it tell me the name of the Buddhist musicians who provide the soundtrack? I used to have their cd, but lost both the movie and the music long ago, but I'd like to get it again. Thanks!",1497139200,,353,4.130434782608695
7976212,2,B00007G23I,"I purchased this DVD with the intent on being given an explanation on why people continue to risk their lives for such an adventure. I was greatly dissapointed. This DVD gave a sparse and short description of un named people climbing in a very generic way. Nothing new or exciting. I expected more, or even some griping detail of the hazards. I didn't get much I'm sorry to say.",1284336000,,378,4.492753623188406

A lot of information.",1138665600,4,80,4.333333333333333
