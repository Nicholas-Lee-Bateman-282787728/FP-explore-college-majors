4713683,4,B005JZBP9G,"I love Tom Cruise despite everything, and these are some quality movies to add to my collection. If you're looking for special features you'll be disappointed, but if you just want films then this is for you.",1337299200,,208,4.648648648648648
4713684,5,B005JZBP9G,Good collection of action movies. Each movie on its own disc. Good soundtracks to show off home theater system. Invite the neighbors over to avoid any loud noise complaints.,1336608000,,173,5.0
4713685,3,B005JZBP9G,"Doesn't Come in Separate packs, all the blurays are in one pack.
Bought the product when it was cheap.. Good for the price....",1336435200,,126,4.521739130434782
4713686,4,B005JZBP9G,"I was a bit disappointed to see the quality of these movies. Thinking the producers would have done a little extra to bring out these titles. They were grainy and seem to be just a flat copy over from DVD. True the picture had
more pop and more vibrant color but that is expected of all bluray transfers because of the higher bit rate. Sound was good though and due to this I felt keeping them was justifiable else I would have just kept my DVD's Top Gun and days of thunder. War Of The Worlds and Collateral is still decent flicks as well if the cost is worth it. As you can see I'm clearly mixed with this package.",1335398400,5,616,4.141666666666667
4713687,5,B005JZBP9G,"Five good movies at a bargain price, was able to sell my standard definition copies and recoup more than the price of the entire set. I like how all five movies are together in one slipcase, saving room on my shelf. Wish more movie sets came packaged that way.",1334880000,,260,4.326530612244898
4713688,5,B005JZBP9G,"This ""Deal Of The Week"" is great! This collection of movies is well put together, and you can't beat the value 5-pack. I love Minority Report and Top Gun. I can't wait to watch Days Of Thunder, it came out the year I was born! All five movies come in one case with clip-cover. I'm very satisfied!",1334707200,,296,4.2105263157894735
4713689,3,B005JZBP9G,With so many Tom Cruise movies to choose from why did they have to include a rated R movie in this collection. I would have bought this in an instant if not for that.,1334534400,,166,3.911764705882353
4713690,5,B005JZBP9G,What a good deal for the price. These is a good collection of Tom Cruise in high definition blu ray. Good action and good stories and good acting.,1324857600,6,146,4.25
4713691,4,B005JZBP9G,"This is nothing more than a re-packaging of 5 blu-ray movies, all of which have been released individually.  If you don't own any of these movies already, this is a very good deal, and these are all movies worth owning on blu-ray.

Unfortunately, there is one problem with this set: ""Minority Report"" was originally a 2-Disc release, but in this collection the studio has only included Disc One.  This means that none of the bonus features for that particular movie are included in this collection.  And that's a shame, because the ""Minority Report"" bonus features are really good in my opinion.

If you only care about the movies, then this is a great set.  If you do like to see some of the behind-the-scenes goodies, it's still a pretty good deal - the other four movies will all have bonus material... but just be aware that you're missing out on the ""Minority Report"" extras.

VIDEO QUALITY:
++ ""Collateral"", ""Minority Report"", and ""War of the Worlds"" are well worth the upgrade to blu-ray, and look incredible.
--  ""Days of Thunder"" and ""Top Gun"" are a bit disappointing, although I believe this is still the best-looking version currently available.

AUDIO SPECS:
""Collateral"" -  DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1
""Days of Thunder"" -  Dolby TrueHD 5.1
""Minority Report"" -  DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1
""Top Gun"" -  DTS-HD 6.1  &  Dolby TrueHD 5.1
""War of the Worlds"" -  DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1

4713700,4,B005JZBP9G,"The set is great with a great selection of movies but I have one complaint not related to it's condition. Two of the movies, Collateral and War of The Worlds, were filmed using some kind of weird filter that has a REAL grainy feel to them. This makes buying them on BluRay pointless because it's like watching a movie from the 30s. Like I said, nothing wrong with the packaging or anything just these two movies which some director thought it would be ""cool"" to put a grainy effect on them....NOT.",1360540800,,497,4.472527472527473

4713704,5,B005JZBP9G,"I have watched Cruise become a great star - I do love his acting abilities and how he really gets the character into his head to play the parts so well.  Keep up the great work, Tom...",1355270400,,184,3.972972972972973
4713705,4,B005JZBP9G,"I picked up this collection during a lightning deal for $25.  At that price, it was a no-brainer.  I've never been a Tom Cruise fan, but I'm happy I can separate my personal opinion of him from my respect for his work.

Collateral is my favorite film of this group.  All the characters do a great job playing against type: Cruise as a murderous sociopath, Jamie Foxx as a nervous, frightened cab driver, and Jada Pinkett-Smith as a (blessedly) low-key, dignified attorney.  The ending is far-fetched, but the ride is a thrilling one.

In the futuristic Minority Report, Cruise heads up the ""precrime"" police division, a group dedicated to stopping crimes before the perpetrator even knows he/she is about to commit one.  It's assumed that the program is 100% accurate until Cruise finds himself on the other end of an investigation.  The themes raised in this film are frightening but conceivable.

I enjoyed War of the Worlds more than most people I know, but I'm a sci-fan, in general.  The characters are cliched, but the special effects (both visual and sound) are great, as one would expect from a Spielberg-directed film.  I originally saw this film in the theater, and I remember being surprised that it was rated PG-13, because there were some big scares.

Top Gun - what needs to be said about this one besides the following: It's loads of fun, pure 80's cheese, and the volleyball scene will remain a classic.

I'm intentinally ignoring Days of Thunder which was a total snoozefest for me.",1348704000,2,1499,4.785992217898833
4713706,5,B005JZBP9G,"For Some reason they always release these kinda collectors edition Blu Rays after having already bought 3 of the original movies on Blu Ray and now for even a better price so sometimes is worth waiting with 5 good movies especially Top Gun PG with extras & special features - Collateral R with extras & especial feautures - Minority Report PG with no extras - War of The Wolrds PG with extras & special features and Days of Thunder PG with no extras except for Theatrical Trailer and when ever I play this movie on my PC reads as Top Gun , no drama because rather watch it in my main entertainment unit with a bigger screen , Five Good Movies on Blu Ray for a good price Great .",1338768000,,678,4.223076923076923

8476269,4,B005JZBP9G,"Tom Cruise Blu-ray Collection includes 5 films on 5 discs (Minority Report, Top Gun, War of the Worlds, Collateral, Days of Thunder). Since all the stand-alone BD releases of these films have been repackaged in this collection it is good value for those who haven't upgraded from the DVD versions. The films are all worth watching but my favorites are Top Gun and Minority Report. Top Gun is absolutely hilarious with awesome '80's music and Minority Report is based on a work by Philip K. Dick. Collateral and War of the Worlds are also interesting. Days of Thunder is the lesser of these films. Overall the picture quality is good and the audio is even better. This collection comes stacked with extras (over 7 hours of bonus content).

Exclusive to this release, Top Gun also gets the Best of the Best featurette (SD, 29 min.) which looks at a flight training facility.

Buy this Blu-ray collection. If you are a Tom Cruise fan you are getting your money's worth in this collection with 4 good films (and Days of Thunder). Fans of Top Gun should know the transfer isn't excellent but still the best version available on Blu-ray. Minority Report fans may be interested in the 2-disc version with all the extras that didn't get ported over here.",1378944000,,1834,5.066225165562914
