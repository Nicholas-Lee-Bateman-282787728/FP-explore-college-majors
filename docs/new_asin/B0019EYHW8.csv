8273730,3,B0019EYHW8,"I would have preferred a tactical lesson in managing your own money.  Everyone likes the professional Cantonese spinsters - their families like them because they have a free and willing slave who puts other people's kids through college and will leave them their real estate holdings.  Employers LOVE them for their high personal standards and trustworthiness.  I bet most of them would mind very much if they were depicted as mostly lesbians because they would feel it was inappropriate to think that familiarly about them but probably this would have been a good option for natural born lesbians but alas this was a Shunde thing.  Shunde is famous for being the birthplace and ongoing source of Cantonese cooking which is really THE ne plus ultra of Chinese cuisine.  Very creative and intellectual and sophisticated thought processes involved in their original ideas about food.

I found this movie boring with shots designed to be about looking nice.  Ultimately, this is one option in frankly a very nasty facet of Chines society - the chauvinism in Chinese FAMILIES against daughters - so as a drudge report, this one isn't laying the blame enough.

Whenever I see documentaries about China today and the daughters are ALWAYS expected to leave school and work because they have a male sibling who needs to come first and finish his education - I just think it is offensive and cause for a grudge - a war.  People should be made sorry for screwing over young girls like this.  And the girls have to be careful which is how the bangless hairstyle adopters came about.  This was an option for the clear eyed - marriage and raising daughters remain so tactical AGAINST females in Chinese society and possibly elsewhere that this unique distinct group is testament to that lesson learned i.e. get a job, a career.",1404604800,,1814,4.857142857142857
