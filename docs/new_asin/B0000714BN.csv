7973519,5,B0000714BN,Loved the final reunion between Pete 'n Tillie co-stars...Carol and Walter in this poignant and funny story.  It must have been a fun set to be on...probably much reminiscing about their PETE 'N TILLIE days.  John Stamos was terrific as well.  A great film for people who are especially aging well...along with the rest of the world!,1404518400,,333,4.807017543859649
7973520,3,B0000714BN,"Sure, it's sentimental, and the guy who plays Matthau's son is too beautiful to be plausible, but it's great to see Carol Burnett and Walter Mathau again. The two have great charisma.",1376611200,2,183,4.75
7973521,5,B0000714BN,"A lost gem...one that I have never seen, Walter still has that gleam in his eye
