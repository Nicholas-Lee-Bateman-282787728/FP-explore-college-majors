1000417,5,6305156441,"Bubblegum Crisis has long been one of the most popular Anime series in existence. Take buxom ladies in super-powered armor (Called Hardsuits) and pit them against an evil monolithic corporation called Genom, add in a  killer soundtrack and Gibson-esque environment and you've got Bubblegum  Crisis. Lots of explosions, computers and big robots. Life doesn't get any  better.",913334400,,374,5.526315789473684
1000556,5,6305156441,"This anime was the first of its kind to draw me into the world of Japanimation. Of course i seen Voltron and Robtech as a kid but i didn't realize that they were part of the Anime genre. But as i was saying about  the title, i bought this before i even had a DVD player. I knew i wanted  this title just from reading the packaging.  I wish to thank Animego and  everyone involved for an very intriguing title.",953942400,,409,4.075
1000557,2,6305156441,"I love anime. My advice to you is if you do buy this suite, only watch the last two DVD's and skip through the weak-@ss music scenes. The animation is awesome but the voices aren't very good. This is a decent title but it's  not my style. I recommend Lain, ghost in the shell, DBZ, and anything on  cartoon network even though it's edited and not subtitled.",952128000,,357,4.313432835820896
1000558,5,6305156441,"The setting, stereotypical megatokyo 2032 (every anime is set in something-tokyo, 20-something), this is fantastic anime. great storyline, and great plot development, along with action scenes that are mesmerizing.
However: technically, there is a bit to be desired. The  picture is not too stable, and moves a bit on screen (maybe becuase of my  DVD-ROM drive, so don't take that for gospel). The sound is decent, and  picture is a bit fuzzy, but hey: for 1987 vintage, it's pretty nice  stuff.
the ""multiplay disc"" simply has some extra stuff for PC:  you can print out technical notes and images from the gallery that can only  be viewed onscreen.
and, a little pet peeve...the discs come in normal CD  jewel cases, not DVD clamshell cases...so i had to go buy some blanks to  throw the disk in. but i'm just wierd.
but all in all, a sweet anime.  it's long too, so you can cardly beat it for fun and viewing  pleasure. definitely a must have.",950486400,3,945,4.672727272727273
1000559,4,6305156441,"Bubblegum Crisis, is the epitome of ""cyberpunk anime."" Lots of mechs and high tech weapons set in a foreboding, futurisitic Tokyo. But all of this stuff would mean nothing if the story wasn't good. As it turns out,  the story is great and classic anime.
Follow the exploits of the Knight  Sabers, a group of women who don mechanized suits against the malicious  Genom Corporation and its evil ""boomers,"" (cyborg/robots).
From  the first episode, to the 8th and last episode, the animation is great.  Each story is well done, some are continuations while other episodes are  storylines within themselves. But what puts this over the top, is the  soundtrack. In fact, the Bubblegum Crisis soundtrack is one of the best  anime soundtracks ever made. Lots of dark, foreboding rock music set  against the neon glow of futuristic Tokyo help to create a really  enveloping atmoshphere. This series is the reason why I got into anime. One  of the great anime series of all time.",948412800,5,970,4.853658536585366
1000560,4,6305156441,"Bubblegum Crisis as much as any other anime, is what brought Anime to the American mainstream.  The DVD brings an end to the perpetual subbed vs dubbed argument by allowing you to choose.  The animation and story are  good and this is a DVD that I rewatch frequently.
I do have a few  complaints, mostly the packaging.  This is not packaged as a DVD, but in  normal jewel boxes and packed more like software than as a DVD set.  Also,  for a series that isn't really very long, it seems strange that the set  requires 3 DVDs.
Complaints aside, I recommend this series to anime fans.",944784000,14,581,4.40566037735849
1000561,5,6305156441,"This is an awesome series of anime! The mecha is great, the Knight Sabers are infinitely cool, and the storyline is top notch. Fast, furious action, good pitcture quality (for being 10 years old) and pretty cool music (if  you like 80s stuff) make this set a must-have if you're looking for some  great anime. Hey, the price is right for this much anime on DVD, so what  are you waiting for? Buy it already!",943142400,5,407,4.4
1000562,4,6305156441,"I like this, it isn't the greatest Anime out there but it is good.  the picture quality is pretty good considering the age of the films.
There are the usual translation problems and drop you in at the deep end stuff  like most Anime.
Like what is a Boomer, why isn't the background for  Silvia Stingray explained better.  Also some of the episodes seem like  fillers, the car one for instance.  They only seem to establish Pris and  Sylvia as characters leaving the other two until the last couple of  episodes. They also introduce main characters on a whim expecting us to  care when they die, they don't seem to establish relationships between them  and the Night Sabres.
You may get the impression i didn't like this but i  thought it was good Anime. Like a Jackie Chan film you forgive these sort  of things in Anime because it just doesn't seem to matter.",939945600,,860,4.512987012987013

1000564,5,6305156441,"Having been a fan of BGC since 1994, I was overjoyed when I heard this was coming out. To me, BGC remains one of the standbys of modern anime fare. We have all the right stuff: likeable and striking characters, a gothic  cyberpunk setting, hardcore mecha combat action, and ....well, J-pop idol  music. It's not as silly as it sounds, either.  Most importantly, the  storylines touch the heart as well as thill the senses. We have plots  motivated by revenge, bitterness, sorrow, the desire for justice and  obsession. They make a lasting impression even in today's age of  CGI-enhanced animation. I will agree with my fellow reviewers: the  packaging was just silly. It was on my software store's shelf for weeks  before I realized it was a DVD set and not one of those jukeboxes. Also, I  will warn others that the subtitling is embarassingly out of sync in places  on disc 2. Still, with these meager flaws, this is a set that no sci-fi  enthusiast can be without.",932256000,2,967,4.65680473372781
1000565,5,6305156441,"Box-comments aside, this is the top piece of anime available as far as I'm concerned. Nothing comes close.
The quality of the DVD is excellent, and the subtitles seem to be pretty accurate (I'm measuring them against a  fun-subtitle job).
If you're looking for the one piece of anime to buy or  view, this is it. Lodoss War and Tenchi Muyo are good (I love Tenchi Muyo),  but Bubblegum Crisis is the best piece of anime available by a mile.
I  just wish that they had made more than 8 episodes (Bubblegum Crash does NOT  count). Still waiting for Paradise Lost - but I heard that was coming out  years ago.

7886383,5,6305156441,I received an advance copy of this set and it's spectacular and is reasons.  I can tell you having only gotten to see a few episodes of the series total that the show itself is  entertaining.,1366416000,,191,4.277777777777778
7886384,4,6305156441,"Bubblegum Crisis 2030 ovas (1-8) sci-fi/action: set in the same universe as A.D. Police Files, this is several years into the future. The secret vigilante group known as the Knight Sabers has been formed. They arrive earlier than the A.D.  Police to the crime scenes and usually destroy the boomers without their help. The quality of this anime is equal to the A.D.Polic Files. (mentioned above). The Knight Sabers are women that work undercover along with a rich mistress named Sylia. They wear these mecha outfits which they call hard suits. Their sole purpose is to destroy renegade boomers which are causing public harm; they never handle human/ civilian crimes ( they leave that up to the regular police). Most of the episodes are self-contained stories, but it is good to watch all 8 of them for continuity. The animation is fluid, the character designs and backdrop of a futuristic Tokyo are beautiful, like a world based on Bladerunner. The action is gritty and gory. And the stories are interesting albit cynical. The only problem with this series was the lack interesting characters: something which is corrected in the next series. Blood and gore, light nudity, for adults only. The episodes are also self contained, except for the last 2 episodes which continued. Ends on 8 then connects with the anime Bubblegum Crisis 2040",1076976000,4,1336,4.964285714285714
7886385,4,6305156441,"""Bubblegum Crisis"" is an interesting production that seemed to get exponentially better as the series continued.  The first three episodes almost completely turned me off to the series.  But, it was sunday, i had nothing to do, and only 5 more episodes to complete the series.
When i sceptiacally threw in the second DVD i was pleasantly surprised.  The first three episodes were very bland.  Dark film was waay overused the voice acting was nothing to write home about(English) and the stories ...well, there wasn't much.  Just work your way to the climactic fight at the end of each episode.
Episodes 4 through 8 were Much Better.  The Artwork remained the same, but the intros improved and all of the sudden we have some really interesting stories that involve outside characters (kind of how Bebop did with ""Heavy Metal Queen"" and ""Jupiter Jazz""...deviating from a concrete plot line)  It really worked.  I am very surprised that the series was only 8 episodes long.  That was kind of dissapointing.  It wasn't toward the middle of the series that i started to really enjoy it.  And there was no conclusion to the series at all!! None!!!
On the Plus side, I was really impressed with the artwork. Considering how spoiled we are with recent releases, ""Bubblegum Crisis"" is drawn very well and you can easily see how Anime Titles like ""Iria,"" and others were infulenced.
Let's talk for just a few seconds about the Unnessary but very enjoyable ""Boobage"" shots!  There were only like 4 during the whole series and they were super unneccesary.  I guess the production team was like ""Hey.. wanna see what they look like without their uniforms??""  Well, there you have it!""  These not sexual in nature, but really funny.  I guess you could say they remind me of the girls-locker-room scenes you would see in ""B"" movies from the eighties.  2 seconds of lacy underwear and brief nudity going from civilian clothes to fighting armor (with some kid always trying to sneak a peak) just made me laugh to myself!  It's really funny !
Anywho - Even after seeing it, I really don't know all that much about ""Bubblegum Crisis,"" other than what i've told you + only 8 episodes long and dated 1987.  Was it an OAV from a manga series?
I was a little turbed with the length of this series, and that lack of closure.  I hope the sequals are somwhat enjoyable, I'll have to rent them.
To sum it all up, ""Bubblegum Crisis"" is a Very enjoyable little series with enough for everyone.  Good fighting, A little graphic violence, motercycle chases, Androids, and a little ""boobage"" What i thought was going to be just an average anime gets 4 stars from me.  I really liked it

7886386,3,6305156441,"A great translation from video.  Animation quality is great in the DVD virsion.  The down side with the DVD Collector's Suite is the packageing.  Instead of using DVD cases, it uses CD cases a bad desion on the company's  part, if you want to display them with your other DVD's.",967334400,2,278,4.5
7886387,4,6305156441,"Bubble Gum Crisis; a techno-punk spectacle, is a story of four women who  become vigilantes in future Tokyo.  Using futuristic weapons and body armor  they battle the evil forces of the Genma Corporation.  Spectacular  animation matched with superior characters makes this a staple of Japanese  Animation.  This original series has spawned others along the line such as  ""Bubblegum Crash, and AD Police Files."" New versions of this  series have been produced for Japanese television.  Although slightly  primitive in comparison, Bubblegum Crisis 2048 is an excellent companion to  this series.",965779200,3,593,5.53932584269663
7886388,4,6305156441,"Before I go into this review, let me say that I LOVE Bubblegum Crisis. I have loved it since it first came out in Japan. It's a great example of cyberpunk anime, and it's a good first series to watch if you are  interested in anime, or wondering about what anime is. Some violence and  MILD nudity may make this series unsuited for young children. I give the  series itself 5 STARS!
Animeigo did a great job subtitling this series,  and the voice dubbing isn't half bad at all.
The DVD transfer quality is  pretty good. There is a Bubblegum Crisis interface that you can install on  your computer and use as a player. It's a neat extra. The gallery is a  collection of pictures, most of which have been published elsewhere, so  there's nothing new there. The bonus videos consist of scenes from the  episodes. Where did the Hurricane Live stuff disappear to?
I was really  disappointed with the packaging however. It consists of three DVDs shipped  in unlabeled jewell cases (not the standard DVD case). There are no liner  notes, no booklets, none of the usual stuff you get with a DVD purchase. It  really looks like it was produced by a bunch of pirates, burned to CD and  shipped off in a plain brown wrapper. I know I'm being picky, but I was  really hoping for something a little more. I mean, if you've bought  collectors editions before, you usually get some neat little gimics that at  least make you feel like you've got a collector's item.
If you're a fan  of the series, this is a cheap way to get all the episodes. If you want  something to add to a collection, buy the individual DVDs. It's more  expensive, but at least then you can tell the difference between pirated  copies and something produced by a good company (which Animeigo is). I  could do a better job with MicroSoft Paint and sticky labels.",960336000,17,1818,4.495412844036697
7886389,3,6305156441,"Besides the subtitled problem (i prefer listening in japanesse anyway... I've watched them so much, i know what they're saying hehehe), the one thing that made me angry was the set didn't include the Hurricane Live  videos.  The videos are important because they go into how and why Linna,  Priss and Nene joined the Knight Sabers.  Otherwise, it's damn good, go buy  it.",954460800,,371,4.825396825396825
7886390,5,6305156441,"BGC is prolly the best anime  that I have experienced, and I agree with some of the other reviewers, that the packaggeing put out by media 2000 was absolutley horrible,  The only way to watch this is in the original  japanese, becuase the actors that did the dub were totally out of  character, and in my opinion, pathetic, and even scary at times.",954115200,,348,4.476190476190476
