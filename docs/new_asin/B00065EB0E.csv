2168697,1,B00065EB0E,"I bought the Spanish version of this DVD and there was NO POINT AT ALL. If there is no speaking on the video, why advertise it as the Spanish version? RIDICULOUS. Buy it only if you are aware - this is music and cheap (and random!) animations.",1343779200,23,243,4.191489361702128
2168698,4,B00065EB0E,I purchased this for my 16 month old daughter as a way to relax before bedtime.  She loves all the other Baby Genius video's and this one didn't disappoint me at all.  It's very relaxing and she loves to watch the children play-especially the scene at the beach.  I would recommend this video for anyone who wants to calm their child down before nap or bedtime.  She's only made it through the video a few times-she usually falls asleep before it's over.,1326585600,2,454,4.5
2168699,1,B00065EB0E,"There's cheap ripoffs and then there's baby genius.
I wasn't expecting it to be anything comparable to the
baby Einstein series but this is atrocious.
The images have are low quality, and unattractive.
The video entirely lacks imagination, creativity and any sort of quality whatsoever.
 You would think making a baby Einstein ripoff would be easy right? Get some colorful toys, take some colorful animation and throw it together to classical music.
This video can't even achieve that. It held my kids attention for about 1 minute. They now cry when it come one.

HORRIBLE!!!
Note: I have 4 videos in this series. They are all a waste of money. Who makes this garbage???!!!",1310515200,31,673,4.894736842105263
2168700,5,B00065EB0E,"my son (9 mo) has loved this since he was only 4 months or so.  it's calm and soothing for just waking up or in the evening, and there are a variety of images from animated, to children playing, animals, and toys.  definitely money well spent.",1238025600,3,243,4.260869565217392

2168702,3,B00065EB0E,"While it is a Baby Genius CD it in no way compares with Favorite Nursery Rhymes and Favorite Children Songs which is the best, after getting all the Baby Genius CD's I would save my money on this one as it is not able to really keep their attention for very long, not much in the way of children interaction like some of the other's, maybe ok for younger children, our grand daughter was 18 months when she got it and she watched it the first time and didn't make it through the entire CD before she was bored with it.",1185408000,7,518,4.138613861386139
2168703,4,B00065EB0E,"Our 1 year old really likes this DVD. The musical selections are great and we even enjoy watching it each night as we all get ready for beddy-bye time.  The only complaint I have is the annoying animated characters that pop up from time to time, especially the tiger in the UFO and the little boy driving the car across the screen then blows the horn when your little one is just about asleep??? Who thought that was a good idea?  All in all it's a good DVD for the price.  I would advise purchase.",1184803200,10,498,4.221052631578948
2168704,5,B00065EB0E,"My son started watching this at 2 weeks of age. Decided to buy a new DVD for a change, so we bought him a Baby Einstein. The Baby Einstein didn't hold his interest at all compared to this Baby Genius video. He still watches the same video at almost 12 months of age and is still captivated by it. Definitely worth the $10! We are now buying a new Baby Genius DVD for his first birthday.",1171584000,4,386,4.092105263157895
2168705,5,B00065EB0E,I love this video and music cd combo.  My three year old likes to watch the video before bed.  It calms him down and gets him ready to go to sleep.  I had looked every where trying to find this particular video.  I tried Wal-mart and any other store that I could think of that might have it.  Thank you so much for carrying this item.,1169856000,4,334,4.0

2168707,1,B00065EB0E,This was not at all what I expected.  The dvd does not really make much sense at all and the music is quite boring.  I would have returned but for the price it wasn't worth the hassle.,1453248000,,184,3.945945945945946
2168708,3,B00065EB0E,"I got this because I loved this episode on Netflix before they took it off and used it occasionally to help put my daughter to sleep. I loved that on the Netflix version, there was a point in the middle of the episode where they would count to 10 and display the numbers as they counted (with mozart still in the background) and they also did the ABC's and showed the letters. I've always heard that you retain things while sleeping or in a sleep-like state and I wanted her to at least hear and recognize 1-10 and the ABC's while listening to soothing Mozart night time music. I was bummed when they took it off netflix, so I searched and found this and bought it. For some reason though, this DVD does not have that part of the episode in it. Idk why they took it out, but I was certainly bummed and do not use this as much as I did Netflix. If they took out the scenes of the kids playing and put back the ABC's and 123's, it would make this a MUCH better DVD.",1432944000,2,963,4.1005291005291005

2168713,4,B00065EB0E,"I purchased this set after having borrowed it from the library a couple of times. The images are beautiful, though some are much too vibrant for bedtime.

2168716,5,B00065EB0E,"My daughter is about 9 months she found this DVD interesting. Her bedtime is 7pm, but at about 5:30 - 6 pm she gets a bit cranky. We played the DVD for her and she relaxed and calmed done. It almost put her to sleep. :)",1392163200,3,219,3.782608695652174
2168717,4,B00065EB0E,This is the first video that i played that put my super hyper daughter to sleep within 15 min. I am very impressed i did not give it 5 stars because as she got accustomed to the dvd she took longer to fall asleep. or maybe she is just getting older. either way awesome way to introduce classical music to a child that is sort of tv or screen crazed. enjoy.,1378771200,2,356,4.028169014084507

2168720,4,B00065EB0E,"We bought the Baby Genius box set that came with this and three other titles. I've scoured Amazon and the like to find a DVD similar to this to mix it up a bit and I haven't found anything close. Our daughter has watched this DVD before bed every single night for over a year now. There are about 8-12 segments from animated numbers and vegetables to real-life zoo animals and kids playing on the beach, all set to classical music. I love the music, the variety and it has a very nice flow to it.

There are a few minor reasons I did not give this five stars:
1) The last segment is very nice- calming, slow and quiet but immediately following starts a very loud and up-tempo commercial for Baby Genius.
2) It's very short, only about 35 or 45 min. We usually start the DVD to signal bedtime so many nights we have to rewind it before we get through with bedtime.
3) Some of the animated segues I find counter intuitive for a bedtime DVD i.e. a chatty monkey and honking car horn.",1367625600,3,980,4.240641711229946

As a bonus a CD is included!  This allows you to take the tuns on the go, or play them at night without the TV.

The value is OUTSTANDING!  You can't find a better deal than on Amazon.  I absolutely recommend to all of our friends and family with small children.",1454544000,2,530,4.553191489361702
