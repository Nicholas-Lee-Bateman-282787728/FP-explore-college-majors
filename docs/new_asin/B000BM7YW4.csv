8088715,5,B000BM7YW4,Great DVD for the jazz guitarist. Even the beginner jazz player will benefit from the instruction. Some guitar experience is needed.,1374451200,,132,5.333333333333333
8088716,5,B000BM7YW4,"This is a great instructional dvd for beginners and advanced guitar players alike. This is full of great ideas both simple and complex that could add to your arsenal of guitar playing skills. Also Tuck himself is your guitar tutor and he explains his technique in a simple way that almost anyone can understand. A couple of good things about this dvd is that in the special features, all the exercises (lessons) are listed where you could play it in real time or slow mo with the option of loop, meaning it repeats the exercises over and over in SLOW MO (really great for me, because some of his examples are crazily complex to understand in real time). In conclusion, Buy this book if you want to be a more complete fingerstyle guitarplayer.",1273968000,5,742,4.586466165413534
8088717,5,B000BM7YW4,"This video is a very detailed instruction into the amazing fingerstyle techniques of Tuck.  Tuck is perhaps one of the finest guitarists in history and this video will be beneficial to all guitar players beginninng to advanced, playing any style. Highly recommended!!!  What a joy to have detailed comprehensive private lessons from Tuck......which you can pause and play over and over again.  5 stars for sure!  Thanks Tuck!",1221264000,4,425,5.205882352941177
8088718,5,B000BM7YW4,"I've seen quite a few of these Hot Licks videos, but this one is the best.  Tuck is just really good at breaking things down.  The first half is about walking bass over blues changes, but the second half gets really crazy.  It has all kinds of examples of right hand/thumb fingerstyle techniques...very inspiring, to say the least!",1159401600,10,331,4.672413793103448
