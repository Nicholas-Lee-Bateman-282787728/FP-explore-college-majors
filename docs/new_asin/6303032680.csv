7837403,5,6303032680,"I TRULY, TRULY wish PBS (Children's Television Workshop) would re-release this item as a DVD!!!!  It keeps going out in our public library collection but once the VHS goes or the VHS/VCR players are no longer available....then we will have to look for something else.... and we have BEEN LOOKING!!",1407888000,,297,4.94
7837404,5,6303032680,I used this video to teach my four year old about his body (selected parts) and then used the entire video at a later stage to have conversation about sex.,1366329600,,155,4.2
7837405,5,6303032680,"I use this video when teaching Sex Ed to 5th graders. Since it is only available in VHS and our copy is in rough shape, I spent a good bit of time previewing alternatives this year. Sadly, there's nothing out there that compares to ""What Kids Want to Know About Sex and Growing Up."" I wish someone would remake it for a 21st century audience, but in the meantime I'll be stocking up on used VHS versions and joking with my students about the hairstyles that were popular when I was growing up!",1361664000,,493,4.311827956989247
7837406,5,6303032680,"I' m a middle school health teacher and use this video for my sex ed unit. It addresses uncomfortable sexual subjects in clear but age appropriate way, and opens the door for furher discussion.  I actually ordered this one as a backup since it is in VHS. Although the video is a little dated it is still relevant.",1354752000,,313,4.396551724137931
