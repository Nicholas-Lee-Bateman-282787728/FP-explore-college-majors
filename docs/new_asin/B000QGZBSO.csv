2839002,2,B000QGZBSO,"Susan Powter has been a favorite of mine for years.  Her work outs are low impact, and really get your heart going.  That being said, I was rather disappointed in the ""Lifestyle Exchange- Burn Fan DVD"".

The scenery in the video ""Lean, Strong & Healthy"" is a group of various sizes, which allowed her to show what she is best at- showing how you can modify what you are doing if you're not in shape enough to go full tilt.
This DVD had only Susan, in sort of a Arabian Nights scene.  Cool for a bedroom, but not exactly what I would figure for a burning fat DVD.
I did like her ""no shoes"" thing.  The warmup was ok, but the cool down was non-existent.  Actually had to pause the DVD and keep moving to get my heart rate down, before I could continue to the after workout stretches.  The workout to me seemed quite a lot shorter.  I did the old ""Lean, Strong & Healthy"" video the next day, and it was a far better workout, and longer too.  Better warm up, and a real burn on the cardio, and a nicer cool down.  I also like the way she talks the moves through on the video.
Anyways, she still has got the right idea, but if you are wanting the best of Susan Powter, go with the ""Lean, Strong & Healthy"" video, and hope along with me that she releases it on DVD someday.  :)",1231200000,8,1271,4.105263157894737
2839003,2,B000QGZBSO,"I'm a big fan of Susan Powter's, but am very disappointed in this DVD.  It consisted of very choppy editing, to the point where you're not really sure what move you're supposed to be following.  No real music to speak of, and no class members, so you have to constantly watch her, which gets boring.  I hope she comes out with another one with class members, a better set (this one looks like a harem), better lighting, better editing, and some sort of music or at least, a better background rhythm.  On the plus side, once you actually can get to the workout, it's easy to follow.",1216080000,14,581,4.401869158878505
2839004,1,B000QGZBSO,"Like most of us, I remember her ""Stop the insanity"" infomercials.  I figured she must be onto something to get so famous, but I realize it was her sloganeering and barking that made her so memorable.  This does not translate well in a workout.  I just could not take her voice, her vague instructions and forced energy.  Very distracting.  Also, she says you don't need any extra equipment for the workout, but this is followed by a checklist of other things you'll need in order to do it.

I threw this right in the trash and moved on to the Biggest Loser Cardio workout which is light hears ahead of this irritating DVD.",1207180800,8,622,4.460176991150442
2839005,4,B000QGZBSO,"Okay, first off, let me say, ""I AM A SUSAN POWTER FAN FROM WAY BACK!"" Having said that, I ordered this product because all of the older exercise videos have not been released on DVD, only VHS (all of which I own already). I ordered this DVD because I really like how Susan Powter worked me out in all her other stuff, and hey, its one I don't have. She has changed allot in the last 10 years, but still knows how to be encouraging, and not overly pushy or annoyingly peppy! I gave it 4 stars because its a good work out Susan Powter style! The woman is my all time favorite fitness instructor. BUT.. I took away a star, because she definately needs to fire her cutting room staff. I find myself doing exactly what she is doing, at the exact tempo, and next thing I know, they cut to another scene, and Im off step. Its highly annoying. It happens several times throught the video. There is even a part in the routine where she is telling the viewer how to do a step, and they have a split screen. One half is her top half telling us how to do it, and the other half is supposed to be showing her bottom half doing what she is explaining, but its a completely different step. If you haven't ever done Susan Powter, then Id have to advise you to do some of her other VHS stuff before trying this. I would have been completely put off by this if I hadn't been formerly introduced to her style, and forms through the other videos.",1205452800,35,1426,4.170289855072464
2839006,5,B000QGZBSO,"This DVD is so wonderful.  I just bought it and tried it out with my kids.  It doesn't require any fancy shoes or equipment.  It is fun and exciting.  It has several levels of modification for ANY fitness level.  I am a LARGE lady, and let me tell you I found I could do it.  The great thing is I did it with out feeling like I was having a heart attack or was going to pass out!  It has so many modifications, for any fitness level, I sincerely believe that anybody, including the incredibly fit and gorgeous can get some thing out of it.  I recommend any body and every body try this fitness DVD out.  A huge plus is Susan's great personality.  She is so positive and non-judgmental in the way she addresses her audience.",1192838400,45,723,4.211678832116788
2839007,1,B000QGZBSO,"Bought this at Amazon.com a few days ago and finally had time to try it.  Whoever did the editing didn't know how to count music and made cuts and splices that don't work for anyone who tries to follow with the video.  It would have been great if she had put it out in it's raw form without all the cutesy video editing.  If I were buying one of Susan Powters I would first do ""Building Strength"" then ""Burn Fat and Get Fit"" as they are really done well and are easy to follow.  I just wanted to look at something new and she does the best job of teaching how to do the moves.  All of her real old stuff is great.  Besides, she was dressed more in the old ones:))",1305676800,4,663,3.984848484848485
2839008,2,B000QGZBSO,"I had an old VCR tape of Susan Powters that I loved the workout was great but when my video player was replaced by the DVD I decided to get these new videos of hers, I'm glad I'm not the only one who saw the errors in the editing! I'm so disappointed! The first two videos of the set were just talking where I thought I was getting 3 DVD's of workouts I could rotate I'm not even going to use these at all, yes the workout is easy to do and I do like her routine but its really hard to follow with the camera angles and the editing where I'm following her and then with the next camera angle she is going up when I am going down and it happens over and over in the tape...so very disappointed...:(",1302652800,,697,3.950354609929078
2839009,4,B000QGZBSO,"I love doing this workout.  Yes, the set she is on does look like a harem; strange, but not particularly off-putting.  The music is terrible, just awful.  But... if you can look past either of these judgement errors on her part, you really get a very thorough workout.  She is easy to follow, this is low impact, and for modifications - she is the woman.  All in all, this would be excellent for someone beginning step aerobics and getting used to moving their body.  I would buy used, mostly because of the production quality.  Not exactly worth new price.",1299456000,,557,4.565656565656566
2839010,5,B000QGZBSO,"This DVD has taken many of the classic Susan Powter moves and updated them, slowed them down, and lines them up efficiently for the person exercising. If you are new to Susan or an old timer like me, then you will really enjoy this DVD. The time is quick to get you on with your day.",1294963200,,283,4.071428571428571
2839011,2,B000QGZBSO,"I usually love the exercise videos of Susan Powter because she's very thorough, but this one I'm not crazy about.  She's still thorough, but the timing is off big time and it's frustrating to try and stay in step with her.",1282521600,,222,4.414634146341464
2839012,2,B000QGZBSO,"I love Susan Powter's workouts, especially her old ones, and the moves in this workout are very reminiscent, but the quality of this DVD isn't up to par.  The music doesn't match the movements, and the video editing is off.  Both issues make it hard to follow along without distraction.",1277337600,,286,4.7
2839013,4,B000QGZBSO,I remember watching my mother doing Susan Powter's exercise tapes growing up.  I loved her then and I love her now.  This is a great tape for all types of people.,1265932800,,162,4.193548387096774
2839014,2,B000QGZBSO,This workout is very low impact.  The DVD summary didn't indicate that the user would need a step.  Susan does the work out bare foot but gives you the option to wear shoes.  This workout is great if you're a beginer.  You could even do it without the step.  For the moderate to advanced level person it's too slow and the trainer tends to talk too much.,1259539200,,354,4.223880597014926
2839015,3,B000QGZBSO,This would be a better exercise DVD if whoever was taping it would have kept the camera on one scene. I like Susan Powter & have used her tapes before & liked them. This DVD is taped wrong & not on time.,1252281600,2,203,3.857142857142857
2839016,3,B000QGZBSO,"I love Susan Powter and have burned out her original VHS tapes.  I was ready and looking forward to her Burn Fat DVD.  I still love her - even the new look is great....but the video is impossible to follow.  She is always out of step and many times her instructions don't make sense.  I will keep this tape and use it because I like her style....I'll just have to improvise with the movements.  Too bad she didn't take a little more time in the editing, it would have made the world of difference.",1231977600,3,497,4.24468085106383

8196420,5,B000QGZBSO,"Many cardio workouts appear to be best-suited for people who are already in good physical shape. This one stands out as different because almost anybody can do it from day one. The moves are easy to modify to meet your current fitness level, and you never need to feel out of breath. Susan Powter is also very encouraging and upbeat, just like she always has been. I found it easy to get the hang of the moves, which seem to flow naturally. It's best to have a step platform for this workout, but I think it's do-able even without one, at a very beginning fitness level. I've been a long-time fan of Susan Powter, and I like this workout better than earlier ones for various reasons, e.g. the decorative background is more pleasing to look at than a plain gym. Only negative: the music could be more interesting. It's not really music so much as just rhythmic background, but it does match the moves perfectly.",1398643200,,910,4.5212121212121215
8196421,2,B000QGZBSO,"Susan comes off as a hardened, angry instructor. Difficult to keep up with the step exercises unless you are very fit. Poor editing means the next shot shows her using a different foot. So many better DVDs out there. This one hit the thrift shop pile.",1385942400,,251,4.478260869565218
8196422,5,B000QGZBSO,"I did Susan's Lean Strong and Healthy and got into great shape
While I wait for that to come onto dvd, iI came across this dvd. It works.
It is Susan at her best encouraging you to do your best. I strongly recommend this",1368316800,,220,4.0227272727272725
8196423,4,B000QGZBSO,"I lost a lot of weight with her ""Moving "" VHS tape and this one is enough like it I'm comfortable with it.  It adapts to any fitness level and educates as well as motivates",1357516800,,172,3.914285714285714
8196424,5,B000QGZBSO,"This a great cardio workout, I am a bit of a health nut and am in shape. Man, this makes me sweat! I use a pretty high step for the workout and by the lat few minutes, I am looking forward to the end. Great workout, favorite cardio workout of all time!",1355529600,,252,3.8653846153846154
8196425,3,B000QGZBSO,"It was OK....not great.  editing was choppy.  Would have been better if there was a class working with her.  Some of the moves were hard for me to follow.  Not a good video for someone who is new to Susan Powter.  She doesnt explain ""modifying"" which is something that someone new to exercise definitely needs to understand.
I also wasn't crazy about what she was wearing...not that it really matters that much.  Oh and I didn't like the setting....too much going on...distracting.",1331942400,,481,4.804878048780488
8196426,4,B000QGZBSO,"This is my third Susan Powter workout video/DVD.  The time it takes to complete this is better than some others that could be hard to fit into my schedule, yet you still get a great workout.  I love Susan's energy, style, and instruction.  The reason I did not give it the 5th star is because, like many reviewers, I found it a bit difficult to follow along or stay in step with her.  Either the music isn't syncing with the movement, the editing, or something else.  However, ultimately that doesn't matter to me too much, and I worked up a good sweat.",1329523200,2,553,4.382352941176471
