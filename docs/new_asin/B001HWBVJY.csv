8309834,5,B001HWBVJY,Another great DVD from Chuck Burrows. He takes the time to show step by step how to make a custom knife sheath. Takes a lot of guess work out of their construction with all kinds of tips and tricks along the way. I only wish he would do one on Indian bead work.,1381449600,5,261,3.943396226415094
