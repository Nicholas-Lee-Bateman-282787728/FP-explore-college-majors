8676217,2,B00N49UHDO,"Although I'm familiar with lots of other barre workouts, this was my first experience with Pure Barre.  Carrie Dorr (founder of Pure Barre) leads the workout in what appears to be a Pure Barre studio, with two female exercisers backing her up.  You'll need a barre (or chair), light weights (1 to 3 pounds), a yoga block, and a mat (if on a hard surface).

The workout follows the typical Lotte Berk-based barre format: Warmup/upper body, thighs, seat, abs, and stretch.  For the warmup, Carrie performs knee lifts before doing down to the floor for Pilates-based supine core work (rollups, small curl/block squeeze combo).  After this, plank work is performed with the yoga block between the legs, including a tricky side plank move.  Speaking of the yoga block, it is placed between the legs for most of the warm-up.  Pushups (both wide and tricep pushups) are next, including a staggered push-up with one hand on the block.  Carrie concludes the floor work with reverse pushups (tricep dips).  Coming to standing, Carrie picks up the weights for more tricep and rear shoulder work before moving into shoulder and bicep exercises.  This segment concludes with brief stretches.

Carrie and crew move to the barre for calf work (with the block between the legs).  After this, three sets of thigh work are performed.  The first set is done in a lunge position on releve (with pulses, squeezes, and tucks--again with the block between the legs), the second set is front thigh lifts in a turned-out position (with the block on the floor to touch the toes down to), and the final set is done in a chair position with the back to the barre (pulses, squeezes, and tucks with the block between the legs).  You are facing away from the barre in this position.  The thigh work is concluded with stretches done on the floor (quadricep stretch, hamstring stretch into split, standing hamstring stretch/pyramid pose into standing split with pulses).

The seat work is performed in a standing position, and consists of three sets.  Carrie begins with the block between the legs in an upright position for hamstring curls, squeezes of the block, and small press-backs.  After this, you move into a standing position with one leg extended to the side (leg bent, with block behind the hamstring) for press-backs (hand of working side presses into the block for added resistance).  The final set has you holding the barre with both hands to do glute work you'd do on the floor (leg lifs, shoot-outs).  The yoga block isn't used here.  After performing standing glute stretches (figure 4, etc.), Carrie performs the entire series on the other leg.

Abs are next.  Beginning in a seated position, Carrie performs a simulated flat-back exercise (you pull your abs in as you draw the heel slightly in towards you).  The block is between your legs, and you press down on it with one hand.  These exercises mimic those you would do under the barre (with your back against a wall).  The final set of abs is done in a C-curve (both high and low) position, twisting to one side to work the obliques.  Once the set is complete, you repeat it twisting to the other side.  Carrie concludes the core work with prone back extension work, followed by brief hamstring and inner thigh stretches.

There were both good and bad aspects to the workout.  I thought Carrie had a very pleasant, professional personality, with good cueing (unfortunately, she doesn't mirror cue--but it isn't really a big deal here).  However, I wish she would have given more welcome form pointers for some of the exercises.  Some of the uses for yoga block didn't seem logical to me (like during the plank work), but in some instances a playground ball would have worked better.  I also question the chair squat (facing away from the barre).  Since most people do not have a barre in their house, it is impossible to use a chair here, and most people will have to modify by going into a wall sit position (squat with back against the wall).  While I have a sturdy barre (the Fluidity Barre, which simulates a wall-mounted ballet barre), the position was very uncomfortable for my back.  The production quality is also poor (what is up with those grainy overhead shots?), and the music is very repetitive techno.

Unfortunately, while I did like some of the work in this DVD, the cons outweigh the pros.  I would personally not recommend this workout, but your mileage may vary.",1487376000,3,4421,4.783641160949868

I have missed the deadline to return the product so I'm stuck with a $60.00 work out video that is horrible.  DO NOT PURCHASE!",1433116800,2,294,4.407407407407407
