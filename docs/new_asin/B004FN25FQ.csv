8428022,5,B004FN25FQ,"I watched this program on cable TV and loved it.  I was excited to see it for sale as a DVD.  This is a great video for anyone interested in the Mississippi River.  The three guys who make this journey are all likeable, and they make the trip more interesting.  However, the video is so fantastic that it would be watchable without any narration.  This video is a bargain since it would cost thousands to cruise the river yourself.",1385769600,,431,4.405063291139241
