2258638,4,B0008FPIMW,"Incredibly interesting concept.

The dvd options are set up to take on the appearance of a computer disc that gives you limited access to its information, truly unique.

I knew nothing of the manga when I 1st watched this and still enjoy it knowing just as little. The story is far-fetched in a basically humanless world and the episodes don't seem to have chronological value.

I was very pleased with the animation, almost a cross between Aeon Flux and traditional anime. Very little action, but the little is not bad at all.

Can be enjoyed but those curious sci-fi lovers that would rather through there mind to an alternate reality then question all the hows and why's. There is some explanation as to why and how things are the way they are, but I'm sure the manga explaines better.

Not very fast paced, but unique and complex.",1202774400,,834,4.64625850340136
2258639,5,B0008FPIMW,"Blame! is towards the top of my anime list.  Great animation and graphic design, as well as really really great sound design, character design... etc.  If you like esoteric sci fi and anime, go for it.  And yes, very artsy -- but that's a good thing of course.",1137110400,,260,4.375
2258640,5,B0008FPIMW,"based upon the manga of the same name, the only thing it suffers from is that its way to short...its a fragemented glimpse of the story.  i gather that its a stand alone which is also dissapointing.  i really enjoyed this, and would love to  see more.  it was almost like an art film.  there is very little speaking, and the bits that there are become difficult to understand because so little of the story is presented. still it is fabulous. i recomend it to anyone who likes anime, sci-fi, or just film or animation in general.  if you haven't read the manga i highly recomend that as well.  the ""liner notes"" card in the dvd gives you enough of an explanation to help you make some sense of what your are seeing.  fans of David Lynch might also enjoy this.  for David Lynch see the films Lost Highway, Blue Velvet, Mulholland Drive, for a start. you will either love them or hate them heh.",1124582400,7,892,4.357575757575757
2258641,4,B0008FPIMW,"I had no idea whats going on here until I read reviews and othe such explanations online and quite frankly, I'm still a bit confused, but the animation is very unique and that is this discs saving grace.  The DVD is total eye candy, and throw out any hope of some sort of ""plot"".  Inagine your initial confusion from watching Aeon Flux, not the second series but the first one where no one spoke, Aeon died in every episode,and just multiply it by the exponent of your choice. Just be sure its above 10 and you have some sort of idea on how rediculously confusing BLAME! can be. If you want to watch sick cyber punk anime, buy this.  You won't know what the hell is going but its some really slick and interesting animation.  The soundtrack on the DVD is an amazing compilation of dark electronic tracks any fan of industrial music would eat up.  I gave it a 4 because I typicaly dislike anything that isn't plot driven but the soundtrack and animation are just too damn good.",1120608000,6,976,4.4
2258642,5,B0008FPIMW,"Want a great anime with a great plotline?  This isn't it.  This anime consist of about 7 'logfiles', which are shorts that show the world setting of Blame! (Pronounced 'Blam').  The menu is not in English, or Japanese, so a remote that can toggle voice tracks and subtitling is a great help.

My friend bought this from the distributor's booth at Anime Central.  Appearently, this is meant as something to see before reading the upcoming Blame! manga series which may or may not ever see an English version.

However, the visuals and animation are amazing.  If you want to sit and watch some amazing animation and not worry about plot or charactors, you'll enjoy this.  I saw this with a fairly diverse group of anime fans and we all enjoyed it.  I intend to pick it up myself soon.",1118361600,7,782,4.568345323741007

8055976,5,B0008FPIMW,"This was a very interesting story. This disc is not what I am talking about. On Netflix there is a movie that is about 1 hour and 40 minutes long. As far as the animation goes...think Ajin, Knights of Sidonia and Kingdom or Vexille come to mind. This is something I will definitely buy when the movie is released. Unfortunately I have not heard anything about a forth coming series.
  Sure the story has been done before with slight variations. This is about a futuristic city where computers or Netsphere were past of the daily life. Spoiler --> A contagion infects the mass population and the Netsphere suddenly deems humans as an illegal tenant of the city and you can guess from there. This is about the remaining individuals trying to survive...then they find someone with a possible solution and the story takes off from there.

  Very much worth watching!!",1495497600,2,863,4.726666666666667

8055978,1,B0008FPIMW,"I never rated anything a one out of ten until I encountered Blame.

 Perhaps it was because I am a man of the pencil and paper, and I tend to become extremely irritated when others criticize my work. As a result, I don't particularly enjoy ripping someone elses culmination of effort to shreds. Instead, I always appreciate the thing or things a crappy series pulls off successfully, even if they are ultimately insignificant, and I make sure to feature them in my review. Perhaps I chose not to hand out ones because of my opinion that anyone who habitually gives low scores to the things they watch must not enjoy what anime has to offer. Perhaps I chose not to rate anything a one out of ten because I set an impossible standard for what I considered to be the worst of the worst. The standard? An anime has to be just as unbearable or shoddier that Adam Sandlers infamously crappy Jack and Jill, which is difficult to do even if you're trying. I never thought I would live to see the day when my expectation for the most despicable of trash would not only be met but far, far exceeded. Unfortunately, I encountered Blame.

 Blame began as an obscure success, what many consider to be Tsutomu Niheis finest work. It explored a unique perspective on the post-apocalyptic dystopia out Earth had become, or so Ive heard (Thanks to the anime, I will never read the Blame manga). Group TAC, known for spearheading outrageously low-budget products like Baki the Grappler, is the company that agreed to producing Blame, which had become a 6-episode ONA (An ONA is basically an OVA abut much, much shorter). Utterly unaware of the consequences of my sin, I bought the Blame ONA on Amazon because it was cheap, about a dollar plus shipping fees, but the low price slapped onto this title shouldve been a massive red flag that Blame wasn't going to be worth my time.  What finally enlightened me on Blames true colors was its DVD menu; its an exercise in frustration as the menu options are in an inhuman, indecipherable language. With all of this at the top of your mind, do you really think the anime itself would actually be good?

 Each of Blames six episodes conclude after a measly five minutes of airtime yet that doesnt dissuade the fact of this anime overall feeling as if it slogs snail-like to the end of time. Much of this is due to a lack of experience and passion for the art of cinematography; Blame is riddled with lengthy, purposeless, yawn-inducing still shots and in one sequence, the camera pulls off a pointless 360-degree rotation. On top of that, theres occasionally a blue silhouette of a shark randomly floating across the screen (Dont expect there to be a reason for this). What really causes this ONAs cinematography to be absolutely unendurable is when Blame attempts to add some flair to the animation. In one scene, a barrage of epileptic fit-inducing multicolored flashing lights invade the screen (An episode of the iconic Pokmon was banned in Japan for this very thing but Blame is able to get away with it because nobody cares about Blame), The ONA occasionally employs moments of TV static, complete with sound effects, but why I do not know. The fourth episode attempts adopting a trippy feel to Blame with its hazy, dreamy style but everything just looks blurry. At this point, you're most likely thinking, Okay, well the animation sucks. Does this thing even have a good storyline? If you were thinking that, the answer is a definitive and resounding no.

 To claim Blame doesnt have a storyline would be a phenomenal understatement; Blame has no storyline whatsoever. For starters, the titles driving purpose is established and explained in a fashion that barely comes across as vague (the closest I could formulate to a plot point was something about network genes). Theres a fight scene midway through the ONA and, were this any other anime series, it couldve been worthwhile. However, the fight has no solid precedence behind it, its flat-out uninteresting, and it has no real conclusion (Blame chose to transition to another episode AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED). Because there is a profound depravity of structure and cohesion in the ONAs plot foundation, Blames story simply sucker-punches you without warning with random events, quotes, statistics, and characters, and expects you to care about all of them. Speaking of characters, the ones in Blame are but inanimate representations of what a character should be. The protagonists, more precisely the only human-esque drawings that receive the most screen time,  are a black-haired guy (Killy) and a white-haired chick (Cibo); both of them have no depth, dimensions, likability, purpose, or chemistry between them (Theyre not even good enough to come across as stereotypical). The character designs in Blame are invariably hideous and all of them basically look the same (Why? Because again nobody cares about Blame, not even the animators). There are only two voice actors in Blame (one for Killy and one for Cibo), another enormous red flag for potential viewers, and when they have to portray other characters, their lifeless voices are manipulated through an audio processor in order to sound different. The actors utter lack of what the world of classical theater call stage presence is more glaringly apparent thanks to the supremely bland dialogue in Blame. Even the infamous MD Geist had a titular character whose actor voiced his role with as much faux-masculinity as he could muster. However, effort is a stranger to Blame.

You should remember me,  Cibo (Episode 3)

 2003 was an absolute Hall-of-Fame year for anime titles (genre-defining classics like Planetes, Last Exile, Gungrave, Texhnolyze, and Fullmetal Alchemist were released) but Blame was fortunately ushered into the public through the backdoor, little known back then and virtually forgotten now. Sadly, I will never be able to forget or forgive Blame, especially for the so-called ending. To summarize Blames finale, Killy and Cibo didn't complete their mission (of which Im not totally sure I understand) but were apparently about to, practically nothing is explained, and I finished this abomination more perplexed than when I started. Most likely knowing that they would be ruthlessly criticized for Blames existence, Group TAC decided to label this title an experimental animation but that shouldnt have allowed them to lazily smash crap together and christian it an anime. Why Group TAC, or any other production company, would decide to animate Blame is beyond me; the manga wasn't a guaranteed money maker. A mainstream hit of ridiculous proportions. The Blame manga was more akin to a hidden gem, a cult classic, with a miniscule yet insanely devoted fanbase so naturally only the most avid devotee of the manga bothered watching Blame at the time (Theres a reason why it was so cheap on Amazon). Overall, I have to say Blame is by far the worst anime Ill ever witness in literally every way, shape, or form. There is nothing it did right, no valid reason to rate Blame above a 2 out of 10, and this is coming from a man who was once exposed to what I regard as the Unholy Trinity of Anime: Mars of Destruction, Pupa, and Boku no Pico.

At least Mars of Destruction had a decent soundtrack.
At least Pupa had bothered to attempt adding depth to its story.
At least Boku no Pico had one quality scene.

 I would rant for a few more paragraphs about how disgusting Blame is but I think you get the point by now and I won't say anything else because I highly doubt a lot of people are even reading this.

Why? Because once again nobody cares about Blame).",1471219200,,7619,4.843197540353574

8055984,1,B0008FPIMW,I am a big fan of Nihei's artwork.  I gave this one one star because the other reviews give too many.  I bought this hoping to see Tsutomu's art in action. The other reviews being so high sold me on the purchase.  Movement is minimal and the takes are long.  This is more motion comic than anime.  There is absolutely no plot or coherence to this non-story.  I was really disappointed.  I regret spending the time watching this one.  Total waste of time and money even for a Nihei fan.  Read the manga instead.  BE WARNED THIS ONE IS SUPER SLOW AND SUBTLE.,1261872000,2,556,4.310679611650485
