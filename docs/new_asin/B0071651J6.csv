8508021,5,B0071651J6,"This drama about disparate women whose lives are jolted into common aspect by the crimes of men (husbands, boyfriends, son) is riveting. The transformations these women undergo are amazing. Once they realize they've been deceived, lied to, misled, or mistreated by the system and their man wrongfully imprisoned, these women have huge burdens to shoulder or be crushed. Their reactions differ greatly as do their characters: rich, working class, poor, young, old, educated, street smart, bold, terrorized: only one thing binds them together: they are all incredible actors.

It's a shame that this splendid program is not available to Americans. I would buy it in a heartbeat, many times over, and give it to friends. Luckily I was able to experience it online.",1403740800,,761,5.186991869918699

8508023,5,B0071651J6,"I didn't think I would care much but soon found myself 'addicted' to these women who just steal your heart in every episode.  I love BBC and never found much there I didn't like but they really put this show together so well and I appreciate the enjoyment it has given me.  I especially adore ""Gemma"" from season 1 and hope she returns to s2.  All of these women are unique and loveable.  I only wish they would make this available to the US.  I know I will have to wait a long time for season 2 and it's going to kill me.  Thank You BBC for your always and never failing ""Brilliant"" TV entertainment.  Wish I could visit there.",1366243200,,628,4.183333333333334
8508024,4,B0071651J6,This series is excellently written and acted. I can not wait for season 2. We watched it on Netflix but I would gladly pay for season two if it was available in the US. I will keep an eye out for it.,1363824000,,199,3.761904761904762
