2666322,5,B000J20CU2,"I strive on a daily basis to teach my children how to eat healthy.  Mary Toscano appeals to all age levels when discussing sugar's role in a ""healthy lifestyle"".  I recommend this video for people of all ages.",1160179200,4,209,4.473684210526316
8148732,5,B000J20CU2,"I spent 40 years in nursing and have taken lots of medical diabetes courses.  But I learned more in this video than in ANY of those complicated lectures/workshops.  I LOVE this video!  Mary takes the VERY complex and simplifies it with great visuals and metaphors and now I think I FINALLY understand how our bodies metabolize sugar!  As a sugar addict, I find this information priceless.  And as a nurse, I find her information to be accurate - FINALLY diabetes/sugar metabolism ""For Dummies""!",1437177600,,494,4.903614457831325
8148733,5,B000J20CU2,If this video doesn't light your fire.....nothing will.  The best video I have seen in a long time.  This needs to be shown in our schools.,1412121600,,139,4.3076923076923075
8148734,5,B000J20CU2,Really enjoyed Sweet Fire.  Learned a lot in a simple manner.  Anyone can understand this.  She presents it very well!  Would recommend to every home.,1396915200,,150,4.88
8148735,5,B000J20CU2,"Think again.  Friends and I were all  convinced we understood all about sugars and how they work in our bodies. We didn't.  All of us were blown away with Mary's clear engaging presentation. She ties together sugars,polysaccharides (including starches), how they are processed, shuttled and stored in our bodies - and how all this is related to insulin resistance and diabetes. She has a gift for simplifying complex areas so that everyone can understand, even middle school kids.

As a former teacher, my hat is off to Mary for one of the best presentations I've heard in my 32 years of teaching.  She also has a Fabulous Fats! Setting the Record Straight DVD that is also terrific for its distillation of a very confusing topic.",1389830400,,730,4.808
8148736,5,B000J20CU2,"By now, if you don't know how damaging sugar is to your health, then you're simply playing with fire. And certified nutrition educator Mary Toscano explains in very clear language how eliminating sugar and foods that turn to sugar in your body from your diet to give you vibrant health quite easily. Getting back to the basics of living healthy is what helped Mary lose weight and greatly improve her health personally.

But most people are dealing with such unhealthy issues as obesity, diabetes, and abnormal blood sugar control that are all tied to sugar's role in all of this. Getting your blood sugar instability in check by reducing your carbohydrate intake, eating whole foods, and putting your body back into balance again will normalize your weight and health and put you on the path to feeling energized, optimistic, and healthier than ever before!

In just over an hour of viewing time, you'll feel a soothing calm come over you hearing Mary's voice reassure you that you will conquer your sugar addiction and rise triumphant over it-permanently!",1242950400,2,1057,4.966101694915254
8148737,5,B000J20CU2,"With two children under the age of three, the need to understand sugars role on the body became apparent. Sweet Fire was so easy to watch and understand. With excellent visual aids to show how much sugar we actually eat in our diet and an easy to follow format I was able to take in all the information Mary Toscano presented and easily apply it to my lifestyle and what I choose to feed my children. This DVD was a real eye opener for me and my family.  I highly recommend this video to anyone who wants to live a healthy and happy lifestyle.  Thank you Mary for presenting this valuable information and making it so easy to understand.",1210032000,2,637,4.34453781512605
8148738,5,B000J20CU2,"This video was highly informative and so well presented that it helped wake me up out of the deep denial I've been in about my own diet and lack of exercise the past few years. I would recommend this video to anyone who wants to gain a better understanding of the physiology behind sugar's many effects in the body or needs a reminder that our everyday diet deeply affects both the current and future health of every cell in our bodies. Lastly, for high school biology or health teachers, this video would be an excellent addition to class curriculum as diabetes in children, teens, and adults in America is at an all time high and rising every year.",1187049600,3,650,4.516949152542373
8148739,5,B000J20CU2,"I have suffered from hypoglycemia my entire life and learning from Mary Toscano's video about how much sugar is ""hidden"" in many packaged foods. I've changed my snack choices as a consequence, cut back on sugary foods in general and feel way more energetic! Mary makes biochemistry and metabolism completely accessible to the layperson in this fun video. It's the best biology class ever! But it deals with choices we all make every day as to what we put into our bodies, and what results we can expect as a consequence. Everyone should understand the devastating effects a high-sugar diet can have on the entire body. Don't miss this if you want to feel good and be healthy for life.",1177027200,3,684,4.708333333333333
8148740,5,B000J20CU2,"I am a 17-year-old girl that is very interested in nutrition.  After watching this video, I fell in love with it.  It is something that everybody absolutely needs to see no matter what his or her previous knowledge of nutrition is.  Mary Toscano demonstrates what a good balance of carbohydrates looks like and how it affects us when we are not in balance.  After watching this video I was motivated to make better choices in my diet because I had found out what the right choices were.  I already had known what I thought was a lot about nutrition, but after viewing this video I understood the role of carbohydrates in my life on much more fundamental level.  I was shocked to hear some of the information she was presenting.  I just didn't know.  I think it's important especially for teenagers to watch this so they don't become fatties and moody like the rest of my generation.  When kids (or anyone) eats badly they become unhealthy, fat, pissed off and don't exercise.  The things Mary Toscano has to say really help with those problems.  The way it's presented is so easy to understand, you don't need to be a genius to get it, and you don't need to be especially interested in nutrition to be interested in what she has to say.  This video is a must see!",1174176000,6,1263,4.491228070175438
8148741,5,B000J20CU2,"I've struggled with sugar for most of my life -- eating it, not eating it, trying to not eat it and failing, trying to control how much I eat of it and failing, avoiding it completely but at great emotional cost, and so on. I knew the problem had something to do with my blood sugar levels and adrenaline, but I never before understood the chemistry as clearly as I do now, after watching SWEET FIRE.

 Toscano presents the scientific information in a way that is clear and vivid (and sometimes funny), but she herself seems non-threatening and non-judgemental. I appreciate her gentle, yet down-to-earth, approach. She gives her audience the information about how our bodies handle sugar, so we can make our own decisions, but (thank goodness) she does NOT preach about what we should or should not eat.

Her attitude, along with the information she makes clear, reinforce my desire and ability to abstain from eating refined sugars and carbohydrates. It's a big effort, but it's helpful to me to have someone smart and knowlegable who seems to be on my side (and on the side of my health and wellbeing). That's how the video's author comes across, and I appreciate it. I have shared the video with my partner and am looking forward to sharing it with a few other friends.",1172793600,10,1273,4.674107142857143
