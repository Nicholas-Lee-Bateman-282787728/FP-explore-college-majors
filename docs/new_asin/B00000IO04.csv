The case is so easy and simple...Land has been taken by force from its owners and a new immigrants have come to replace them.

1225035,5,B00000IO04,"To get the most out of this video or DVD set, one must be able to approach the subject without preconceptions, without beliefs that exist in the lack of understanding, and without bias towards a particular religion.  Biblical interpretations of who had what first along with English interpretations of Arabic text only polarize an issue that needs no more polarization. The divine right to a land that has been shared for thousands of years has led to the murder of thousands of innocent people. The exiling of, the discrimination against, and the murder of the members of a particular religious group undermines the foundation of almost every religion on Earth; Christians, Jews, and Muslims alike. If you are religious, look deep into your beliefs before you watch this series, and be truthful both with yourself and your God.  The 50 Years War gives us the rare opportunity to see the middle east conflict for what it is, and not for what it is thought to be. It is a war of deep-seeded hatred that is fueled by the biased comments, discriminatory actions, and unfair peace brokering of the people and nations who have involved themselves either directly or indirectly in the conflict. It is a conflict that is made perpetual by closed minds, political agendas, and uneducated youth who seem determined to keep the conflict going.  You will now be able to hear and see the stories, the interviews, and the actions of the men and women who have shaped the development of the conflict over the last 50+ years, and take what you hear and see and apply it objectively to your own belief system. The 50 Years War removes you from the stagnant quagmire of narrow mindedness and allows you to progress your way through an issue that is often miss interpreted. Interpretation is a delicate matter. The 50 Years War treats it as such by not succumbing to biased views. Remember, misinterpretation has led to the rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan, the rise of white supremacist groups in Europe and North America, and it has led to the conflict between the Arabs and Jews in the Middle East.  Keep an open mind, and an open heart and the 50 Years War video or DVD will prove to be invaluable to you and your family.",975888000,21,2209,4.685567010309279

1225072,5,B00000IO04,"This is one of the best and most objective documentaries on the Arab-Israeli conflict. It covers the origins of this conflict since the days of the British mandate during which the mandate power failed to coerce coexistence of the two communities, the native Arabs and the growing Jewish one that was flooding into Palestine not only from oppressive Nazi Europe but also from other non-aligned countries around the world including Ottoman Arab states that prior to the creation of the state of Israel in 1948, did not show any significant hostility toward their Jewish communities.

The British mandate came to an end on May 15, 1948 when David Ben Guerion - Israel's first president - announced the creation of the state. This announcement made the armies of five surrounding Arab countries namely Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon invade Palestinian in an attempt to restore the status quo in favor of the Arab community and wipe out the new infant Jewish state.

But unfolding events showed that while the Israelis had carefully done their homework by raising funds from Jews in the Diaspora, arming their militias and conscripting most of their able fighters, the Arabs had underestimated the Jews by sending in small armies without enough ammunition. The Jewish victory resulted in some Israeli ethnic cleansing of Palestinians in some areas. When the Arabs propagated such news to win sympathy of the world, they had actually spread fears among further Palestinian villagers who further flee their hometowns.

But the conflict was not over in 1948 after Palestine was divided and in 1967, a rematch between the Arabs under the leadership of Egyptian dictator Gamal Abdul-Nasser and Israel resulted in further humiliating losses for the Arabs and this time Israel swept the whole of historic Palestine land along with the Egyptian Sinai and the Syrian Golan. A third war in 1973 resulted in a stalemate and opened negotiations that led to a peace treaty between Israel and Egypt in 1979, and Jordan and the Palestinian Liberation Organization in 1993.

The film is extremely well researched and narrated and the footages it has are extremely valuable. If you are interested in the Arab-Israeli conflict, this film should find its way to your library.",1148601600,6,2260,5.083557951482479
1225073,4,B00000IO04,"After watching this DVD, I was amazed at how countries play war as though it were a game.  Egypt, Israel, Syria, Jordan, and Lebanon fight over land that the Jews took from the Palestinians.

What I am curious about is, if Jews wanted to live in Israel so badly and felt it was their right to take the land, why did they willingly live in other countries prior to 1948.

It does not really seem fair to the Palestinians to be kicked off the land they had occupied for several years.

It's probably something similar to the White Man taking over North America from Native Americans.

Another amazing thing was how easily the Palestinians gave up their land originally considering how bitterly they have fought the Israelis from that point on.

You have to give the Israeli's credit too; they knocked out Egypt, Jordan and Syria when those countries decided to wage war on Israel.

According to the DVD, the Jews were outnumbered 40 million to 1 million and still won.  That's pretty impressive.

While nobody should be forcibly removed from their land, the methods the Palestinians or more specifically the P.L.O. used in trying to regain the territory is ridiculous.

If the Israeli's weren't going to back down to 3 more powerful countries who were going to attack them, what do you think of the probability that suicide bombers and having kids throw stones at the Israeli military will do?

Another troubling thing about the Palestinians was their hardheaded attitude in negotiating with the Jews.

For example, when P.L.O. leader Arafat was offered the Gaza strip, he demanded a road to the West Bank as well which would have split Israel in two.  He also demanded Israel's capital Jerusalem be handed over as well.

Why not get your foot in the door and then work on getting more.  By demanding all or nothing, Arafat guaranteed that nothing for the Palestinians would improve.

Even when a peace treaty was finally worked out, Palestinians continued the suicide bombing which gave Israel any permission it needed to continue the Palestinians oppression.

I worked with a Jewish person once and tried to get insight as to how Jews think.

He told me that because the Jews laid down and were almost eliminated in WW2, the people have a new attitude about survival.

The new attitude being, ""if you step on my foot, I'm going to try to break your leg.""

Ariel Sharon definitely adopted this model and let us not forget that Israeli's can play hardball too.  They have terrorist groups just as the P.L.O. does.

Overall, it's a good study on two very tough-minded peoples who will fight for their own way to the end.",1112832000,7,2617,4.730684326710817
1225113,5,B00000IO04,"This is one of the most gripping documentaries I've ever seen. The more nobel aspects, and the less morally sound aspects of both sides are covered in detail. Excellent work created by 1 Palestinian and 1 Israeli for the BBC (even though the blurb above calls it a PBS show, and indeed so does the generic intro on the DVD - it was actually made by the BBC, not an American company, just thought I'd clear that up)",1106870400,5,414,4.32051282051282
1225114,5,B00000IO04,"I want to start my review by disputing a claim I saw over and again in some of the other reviews. Some reviewers (like the one from Saint Louis) claim that this is a pro-Israeli documentary. I could not disagree more!

1) That above-mentioned reviewer, like many others, is questioning why the documentary does not cover the Israelis doing this and the Israelis doing that to the Arabs. By the same token, I could argue--and I'm an Arab, by the way--why the documentary does not have more coverage on the PLO doing this and the PLO doing that to the Jewish people. The answer to both arguments is obvious: this is a five-hour documentary covering a fifty-year war! You cannot include every detail. Whoever expects this documentary to be more comprehensive is either being unreasonable or lacking intelligence. [period]

2) This documentary explicitly--I repeat, ""explicitly""--portrays the current Israeli Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, as a terrorist: it covers him carrying out his ""blow up buildings and cause as many civilian casualties as possible"" operation in Jordan, the congratulatory meeting he subsequently had with David Ben-Gurion, and more important, the speech that Ben-Gurion gave him, which in itself defines terrorism (you have to hear it for yourself).

(This is not to mention how the documentary covers [1] the Israeli massacre in Dier Yassin, [2] how they pretended not to have received the ""stop the war"" US warning to concur more kilometres into Syria [during the 1967 war], and [3] how Kissinger was stalling during the cease-fire talks so Israelis can march closer towards Cairo [during the 1973 war].)

If this sounds pro-Israeli to you, fine, don't buy it; otherwise, it's a must have.

Now that I got that out of the way, I want to praise this documentary on three grounds:

1) As can be concluded from my first point above, this DVD set is only an introduction package to the Arab-Israeli conflict--and a great one at it. No other documentary provides the ""big picture"" better.

2) You hear the accounts straight from the key players: most of it is in the form of interviews with prime ministers, presidents, etc. where they tell you what was going on and why.

3) It contains a huge amount of footage showing big historic moments such as Ben Gerion's the-birth-of-a-state speech, President Sadat's arrival in Israel, his assassination, etc.

5 STARS without any hesitation!",1103155200,31,2402,5.0
1225115,4,B00000IO04,"PBS took an interesting and useful approach with this documentary, but ultimately it's limited by the simple fact that you can't squeeze the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict into two DVDs.

Many of the major players are interviewed on the Israeli side.  Fewer major Arab figures are there to present their views, partly due to death/assassination, and you're left to speculate as to other reasons.  Thus smaller figures usually speak for the Arabs, from generals to foot soldiers, and footage from old interviews fills in some of the gaps.  There are no reenactments, and little modern-day footage aside from the interviewees.  There is a minimum of judgment or criticism, which may leave viewers wishing for a bit more analysis.  Still, it's a generally pleasing format which uncovers many interesting factlets.

Unfortunately, you don't need to dig very far to find problems, as they begin at the wildly optmistic title: '50 Years War' seems more tragicomic with each passing year, and limits the film terribly in that it starts just after World War II, and ends with a sudden stop fifty years later with peace talks on the horizon and an air of 'happily ever after'.  One gets no backgrounder on the controversies over Jews initially moving to the area, WWI power plays, or the conflict between 1918 and 1945, let alone the collapse of Camp David talks and Intifada II.

What is there is heavily truncated to fit into five hours of film, while a really comprehensive treatment would probably require a full shelf of DVDs.  But anybody trying to gain a thorough understanding of the conflict should review information from as many sources with as many viewpoints as possible, and PBS takes a decent stab at a summary.  It's just a shame about the title.",1091836800,6,1759,4.908783783783784
1225116,4,B00000IO04,"Documentary is excellent for everyone who want to know what had been happening in the middle east for past 50 years or so. I agree with one of the reviews made earlier that the beginning of the documentary is not what it should have been. It does not tell about the region under Ottoman rule and the British mandate after World War I. Furthermore, I was very shocked and in utter disbelief that there is no mentioning of massive airlift provided by the United States to Israel in the 1973 war that effectively saved Israel.

1225120,4,B00000IO04,"Whatever your political views are regarding the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians (and I certainly have my own strong opinions), all serious students of the conflict in the Middle East should watch this PBS documentary.  For those intimately familiar with the general course of the conflict, there are no groundbreaking revelations here.  On the other hand, this five-hour DVD is chock full of archival footage and interviews with many of the political leaders, generals, guerrila/terrorists and diplomats that shaped the many decades of this frustrating struggle after World War II.  Arafat and Sharon, enemies that they are, get to tell their fascinating sides of the story, as does Peres and an aging King Hussein, along with file interviews from Rabin and Sadat.
This DVD is essentially the diplomatic history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  Its story narrowly revolves around wars, conversations between diplomats and heads of state, etc.  If you are looking for an account of the social history of the Israeli or the Palestinian people and their grievances, or want a detailed discussion of the history of settlement activity, terror bombings or life under the occupation, you will be disappointed.  Such controversial and disputed topics are (perhaps wisely) beyond the scope of this documentary.
A significant shortcoming in the video is the absence of any prelude episode that looks over the history of the area in the early twentieth-century under Ottoman rule or the Palestinian mandate.  It begins rather abruptly just as the new state of Israel declares its independence in 1948.  For an understanding of how the roots of the conflict were sewn, again you will have to look elsewhere.  Finally, the video was produced several years ago, when Netanyahu was still Israeli PM.  Eager viewers will have to await a future DVD to explore the terms of Barak and Sharon and the al-Aqsa intifada.",1031961600,98,1923,5.214285714285714

In addition, more maps throughout the documentary to describe the situations of the wars and the settlements.

The only thing i would have to say about this dvd is that it is overdue for an update. So many things have happened in the middle east and in the arab-israeli conflict since this first aired on public television in 1999.
A re-release with significant added new material would be the most appropriate thing to do.",1524960000,,672,4.384
7911021,5,B00000IO04,"Best middle east documentary by far and probably one of the most unbiased which is weird for PBS.  If you are interested in documentaries on the Israeli-Arab conflict, this is the one to buy and watch.",1508457600,,201,4.583333333333333
7911022,5,B00000IO04,The fifty years war was a documentary I saw before and wanted to see again and own.  I am happy with the dvd and the historical value of the story.  The purchase went flawlessly and the delivery was ahead of schedule.,1502323200,,217,4.2682926829268295
7911023,5,B00000IO04,If you really want to learn about Arab intransigence and their refusal to make a real peace since 1948 you must see it. For those who blame Israel for fighting for its life one cannot teach anyone.,1490227200,,197,4.351351351351352
7911024,5,B00000IO04,Excellent.  This series took the time and trouble to cover the history on both sides of the issue.  I was impressed and fully enjoyed it,1454112000,,136,4.4
7911025,5,B00000IO04,"Reveals how the leaders of ALL sides in the conflict make decisions for their personal power/gain at the expense of the people they are leading, usually into intensified conflict.",1438992000,,179,5.206896551724138
7911026,2,B00000IO04,"it's a good documentary but it's definitely not worth $90, especially since it's on Y-tube",1432339200,2,90,5.066666666666666
7911027,4,B00000IO04,An excellent documentary film created ten years ago. I watch it on PBS and bought this video for a historical record.,1404086400,,117,4.619047619047619
7911028,5,B00000IO04,"I waited a long time to get this excellent documentary at a reasonable price. I'd recorded it years ago on poor quality tape and found it riveting.  No doubt there is room for an updating episode, particularly now with Syria on the brink.",1378684800,,238,4.534883720930233
7911029,5,B00000IO04,"This is a great documentary about the various wars between Israel and neighboring Arab states, followed by the Camp David peace agreement between Israel and Egypt, the invasion of Lebanon and culminating in the Oslo Accords.  Its main drawback is it skirts the origins of the Palestinian refugee problem.  Only brief mention is made of it and what is said gives the false impression that it was created by false Arab exaggerations of the Deir Yassin massacre.  Other issues in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict such as the status of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements etc. are not discussed.

Overall, this is worth seeing if you are interested in the conflict between Israel and the Arab states but it's probably not ideal if you are interested in the Israeli/Palestinian conflict.

There is a sequel to this documentary called Elusive Peace:  Israel and the Arabs covering events between 2000 and 2005.",1349481600,,898,5.116438356164384
