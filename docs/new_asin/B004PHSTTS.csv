4444547,4,B004PHSTTS,"This is an absolutely amazing show. It has a well thought out story, great action, and badass characters. This set is worth getting..... if you catch it for $10. I buy it used for these split seasons that charge $35 for 11 episodes. I'm definately not the first to complain and I certainly won't be the last. Viz Media or whoever manufactures these sets turn a deaf ear. Get it cheap wherever you can because this show is worth your time.",1304985600,3,438,4.419753086419753

4444583,3,B004PHSTTS,"I've been collecting anime for awhile now and I have a few observations. At first the Bleach sets were coming in at 5 disc per set. Then the dreaded 3 disc sets emerged. Add to that they are censored. The Japanese version they call each other ahole alot, English version not ever, (plus the blurring of certain things) and not widescreen. Second, as I continued buying sets, I noticed the sound quality was off, fading in and out. None of my funimation sets do this, only Viz. Third, the prices. Paying alot for poor quality sets is annoying, when I know other companies (funimation) are giving you full seasons of shows at super saver prices, and good quality discs.
Viz needs to understand it's American market is not a trash market and has a large fan base willing to buy, but they need to get their hands out of our pockets and do things right. This goes for the Naruto box sets as well, waiting 3 months for outdated discs is super annoying!!
I have been very pleased with funimation produced disc sets, Viz, not so much.
There, I vented. As far as story lines go, it's Bleach. There are sword fights and soul reapers, and blah blah blah. Buy it if you are into the characters and the whole fighting thing, buy, don't buy if you're not.
Oh yeah, hearing all my beloved character voices from Naruto coming out of the mouths of the Bleach characters was a little disturbing at first, but became a game guess that voice.",1376524800,,1422,4.473076923076923

Ok boy can see ghosts, some ghosts eat other ghosts so there r other ghosts that stop the bad ghosts from eating the good ones, boy meets girl good ghost that gives him the power to become like her so that he can fight the bad ghosts.
I know that the bad ghosts r call something and r a little different than just ghosts and that the ones I'm calling good ghosts r called something else also.
I'm just trying to make it simple here ok. ^_^
I really do love this anime just don't want to go into great detail on what is what when someone just wants to know the basics of what they maybe buying even though if ur looking for a anime u most likely already know what ur looking for or buying if ur here.

4444595,5,B004PHSTTS,"From activeAnime.com

Ichigo, Chad and Uryu save the wee girl and learn she too is an Arrancar. She, along with her Hollow family, help the trio but are attacked by a formidable opponent. The battle rages and Renji and Rukia join in, having chosen to help Ichigo.

The terrible white sand attack separates Rukia from the group. She is helped by Ashido, a curious fellow and Soul Reaper. Meanwhile Nel (who unfortunately has a strident voice at times) and her brothers have been kidnapped and it is up to Ichigo and his comrades to save their new friends. A promise is made and the assault on Las Noches occurs.

The team has to split up and each of the smaller groups must battle stronger and stronger opponents. However Aizen is pushing forward his own agenda, forcing Orihime to swear allegiance to him. What he cannot guess is that the shy girl is far stronger of will than he supposes and she is quietly working to do something very final with the Hogyoku.

The big attraction in this latest box set is the team finally getting to fight the Espada and doing so on the Espada's home turf. Of greatest note are the episodes marking the arc of the battle between Rukia and a supposed face from her past - Kaien. As the fight rages, the angst of the history between these two characters creates intense dramatic impact and suspense. Rukia fans will love every moment of it.

The last episode ends on Uryu and his battle with his Espada opponent, revealing the depths of how much his powers have grown as a Quincy. Yet the final episode introducing Uryu's fight holds a surprising amount of comedy before the dramatic final moments.

EXTRAS:
Bonus features include manga ads, trailers of other anime, clean ending animation, production art, and omake.

IN SUMMARY:
Ichigo and friends assault Las Noches and go toe to toe with the Espada!",1319500800,,1836,4.648148148148148

We could get DOUBLE the episodes per box set for that amount of money, yet Viz is charging nearly 50 bucks for for 10 episodes per box set? Who'd want to pay that amount of money? Especially when they are too far behind in the box sets that'd they'd have to dish out over $499.80 just to buy all of them at once if they were buying it at the local stores instead of Amazon?

I agree that the series is great, but it's not worth spending that amount of money for 10-11 episodes per box set...",1313020800,3,550,4.092592592592593

4444599,3,B004PHSTTS,"***SPOILER ALERT*** I am completely addicted to this show first of all.  I own every season released in America so far.  This one I must say I'm the most disapponted in.  Every one of the seasons so far had a story with some sort of resolution at the end.  This one starts off with the adventurers making their first advance into the Hueco Mundo and eventually Las Noches.  Then, 11 episodes in, (the number of episodes included) it just stops.  It leaves the adventurers mid-fight, not even reaching Orihime yet.  This is a change from the second season, where the entire set is focused on everyone making their advance through the soul society, then at the end they finally reach Rukia.  I would have really liked for this one to at least end with the adventurers reaching Orihime.  My recommendation is to wait until the next season comes out in September and buy them together so you don't get that cheated feeling of just completely stopping in the middle.  I wish I had waited.",1309392000,,983,4.597701149425287
4444600,3,B004PHSTTS,"the price is just too much.

buying what they call ""seasons 7 8 9 and 10"", which isn't even the complete story, is over $130. whereas i bought the full stories of season 1 and 2 for much much less.

this is just a money grab plain and simple.

nobody thats seen Bleach questions its quality. it hurts to put less than 5 stars as a rating, but i just cannot in good conscience put more than 3 stars as long as these prices stay this high.

its the price thats preventing people from buying it, and its the price thats causing all the complaints. so please stop telling everyone to stop complaining..its just not right.",1309132800,5,617,4.293103448275862
4444601,4,B004PHSTTS,"Season 9 of Bleach continues the Arrancar Story Arc. Many of the main characters pasts and secrets are revealed in this Arc, and season 9 continues the action. Though the release is NOT 400 minutes as advertised by Amazon (actual run time is 275 minutes with 11 episodes) there are still enough episodes to keep entertained until season 10 is released. For those who would complain about price vs. run time, keep in mind that some places charge $20 for one of the individual volumes. I found mine at Wal-mart for $29.99.

The audio and video quality remains consistent with every prior release to this point. The characters added in this volume are also consistent with the other main characters in the series (and the story arc); a little campy or cheesy at times, but on the whole pretty decent with no changes in voice acting with any main characters. All in all, the translation pretty well done. It also has the 5.1 Japanese audio for the elitists that would prefer subs over a dub. The action and story line continue the Arrancar story, and are ""epic"" if I do say so myself. There is a lot more action per episode it seems like.

Quality of the packaging cover has a consistent look to the other box sets released and the cover art looks nice on a shelf with the others. The construction of the actual case matches the other sets released from season 6 on, and is in my opinion way inferior to seasons 4, 4.5, and 5 (which are in fact inferior packaging to seasons 1, 2, and 3). This set features one of the cheap ""3-in-1"" plastic casings embedded in the box.

There are practically no extra features to consider with this set, but most of the extras for series like Bleach are advertisements for other series (pretty worthless) and a textless intro anyways (also worthless in my opinion), so you won't really miss much in the way of extras.

If you are holding out for a future release that will include more episodes, I wouldn't hold your breath. Shonen is making money still, even considering the limited episode releases, and I for one will keep buying them so don't expect them to bend. But if you don't mind collecting the series little by little I would highly recommend this set.",1308614400,10,2193,4.558375634517766

I am not a big fan of teen anime Naruto or ishiana, but BLEACH has such a great story line! adn such fun characters! It is considered a TEEN ANime but has just enough violence for me to enjoy! Now unless you have seen seasons 1-3 you will have no idea what is going on! I urge  you that if you want to take on this series  you must watch those 1st 3 seasons!

Lo and behold, the problem wasn't with the show itself, but with the annoying people who constantly repeat: ""Vis is selfish, find it elsewhere"" and giving the show 1 star. Why don't you go to Vis' headquarters and yell at them there. It's like giving the show a 1 star rating because shipping was slow. THIS ISN'T THE PLACE FOR IT!",1305072000,20,631,4.266666666666667

Just do yourself a favor, do not pay full price like I did. Three disks are just not worth it. Wait until it goes on sale or buy them used from a very reputable dealer.",1529020800,,500,4.144329896907217
