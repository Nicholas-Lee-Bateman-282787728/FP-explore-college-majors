4263850,1,B0045Y1VCS,The listing photo clearly shows the Blu-ray version which includes the Digital HD code; but the Blu-ray that I received was in a different sleeve and included no code.  Very disappointed.,1457395200,,187,5.032258064516129

4263852,3,B0045Y1VCS,"This is of course written about the widescreen version of the movie.  I had a pan and scan version on my DVR from my Directv subscription.  Thought I would switch back and forth from my PS3 and the DVR to see the difference in perspective.  The widescreen version of course showed more of the sides (length) of the movie than was cut off in the Pan and Scan version to fit a 16 x 9 screen.  The real surprise came when I noticed the letterbox bar (especially) on the bottom was cutting off about a quarter to a third of the picture compared to the Pan and Scan version.  For example: The scene where Tom Cruz is on his ""secure Island"" Cameron Diaz is dressed in a red bikini. In the Pan and Scan version you can see her all the way to her knees as she walks off the porch of the cabin.  In the widescreen you can see more to each side of the scene but as she walks off the porch you can only see to where her legs come together to put it politely.  She loses her knees to the very top of her thighs.  In other scenes the bottom half of the bikini and top of her thighs can be seen but the widescreen version shows her just below her naval and the bottom half of the bikini is missing.  I have a PlayStation 3 and a Pioneer Kuro Display.  it appears that the lower quarter or more, of the entire movie does not show in the widescreen mode.

I have gone through all of my Display and PlayStation settings and can find nothing wrong.  Is this just a bad edit of the movie?  It is the widescreen 2.40:1 version but what good is it to have to make a choice of losing the sides to Pan and Scan or losing the top or bottom to Widescreen mode? Is there an incorrect setting on my display (I have it set to Dot to Dot so the entire movie should be on the screen).  The PlayStation is set to it's Blu-ray defaults and I went through all of them again just to make sure they were set correctly.

Liked the movie very much but the video presentation truly sucks if another chop job was needed to make the 2.40:1 widescreen presentation.  The entire movie should have been there with just a narrower picture on the screen because of the display ratio.  If anyone  has  a suggestion to an incorrect a setting on my  equipment please let me know because right now I feel like I've been had.",1454198400,,2275,4.115646258503402

4263859,5,B0045Y1VCS,"This fabulous film has replaced my previous all-time favorite - I've watched it dozens of times. A must see for surprises, action, charming romance, beautiful locales, great acting and stunts, a truly wonderful screenplay - my only wish is that the DVD and Blue Ray were as complete as the TV version - rats! Missing from DVDs and Blue Ray are the opening scene of Cameron Diaz covered in grease atop scrap cars and a fuller view of her attendance at her sister's wedding reception and interplay with her sister and Rodney The Fireman. Hated to see the movie end - PLEASE LET'S HAVE A SEQUEL!!!",1511136000,,594,4.613207547169812

4263877,5,B0045Y1VCS,"Knight and Day is a movie I've owned before on standard DVD. A friend ""borrowed"" it, and I haven't seen that disk since.  I decided I like it enough to go ahead an buy it again on BluRay.

The movie is a great, fun, action/comedy -- the kind you know won't win any academy awards but you don't care. Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz have good chemistry and comedic timing -- but what really makes the movie is the end.  So as not to spoil anything, it suffices to say that some things come full circle.  Great popcorn movie.",1476403200,3,519,4.212121212121212
