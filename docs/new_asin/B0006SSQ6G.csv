No need trying to verbalize the quality of each; this is manifest in the video and is a matter of individual taste. I can say that the inexpert viewer, whom I personify, should have a lot of fun with the three  presentations. No question that the sequence with the young Nurayev is particular interesting. If, as has been written, he later would like to have had that performance vanish from the historical record, one would understand (while enjoying the melodramatic capering required by Petit). In the musical comedy finale, don't expect to see one of our favorite non-ballerinas, Cyd Charisse. She explained in her memoir that, when asked to perform a ballet number in one of her early films, she had gotten out her old outfit and tried a few steps. When recovered from the agony in her feet, she let the studio know that traditional ballet was no longer in her repertoire. Here she briefly appears in a walk-on.....
There is little complex for the viewer in any of the three presentations. In these pieces, every movement is clearly related to a plot line (simple though that may be).",1301011200,8,1370,4.805084745762712

For anyone who is interested in dance, she is someone who can teach and inspire.....her movements are perfect....her body is perfect, her energy is perfect,  everything is in place and all of it comes together as if by magic....",1278720000,6,332,4.610169491525424
8042816,3,B0006SSQ6G,"Watch these wonderfully talented dancers and choreographers perform in three pieces.  Zizi is exquisite.  The dvd is exiting to watch.  However,the video quality is somewhat poor whether due to the original filming, deteriation, or the transfer to dvd - I don't know.  It is still worth viewing.  I would have bought it anyway for the love of ballet, and the chance to see these people dance.",1171756800,11,392,4.878787878787879
