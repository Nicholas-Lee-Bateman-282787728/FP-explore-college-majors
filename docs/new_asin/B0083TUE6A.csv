5126040,4,B0083TUE6A,Robert Urich is great.  He died too young!  Some of the actors in the series are marginal - not Urich - he's super.  Some of the episodes are a bit hokey - although I probably didn't think so when I first watched them MANY years ago.  Tony Curtis isn't in all the episodes - so don't expect to see a lot of him.  Look for Urich in the Spenser for Hire series too!,1512345600,2,363,3.9178082191780823

5126085,4,B0083TUE6A,"You may be wondering why Ive been highlighting TV series being released on disc lately. The fact is that CBS has been releasing a large number of complete series at affordable prices, even though that $100 or more price tag seems high. When purchased as individual seasons most series can get pretty expensive and take up a lot of room on your shelf. So these new editions are a welcome treat for collectors and fans of those series. This weekVEGA$.

VEGA$ was on TV fewer years than I remembered. In fact it only lasted three seasons. It was one of the many Aaron Spelling productions filled with great looking people, more often than not women, snazzy locations and filled with wealthy people. The situations found in this series didn't revolve around the mom and pops on vacation in Las Vegas but around the high rollers and celebrities there.

Robert Urich starred as the good looking private detective Dan Tanna. Employed by hotel magnate Phillip Roth (Tony Curtis) his job was to do anything Roth required of him. In return he was allowed to remodel a warehouse owned by Roths Desert Inn Hotel to use as his apartment, complete with a garage that was in his living room. Driving a red 57 convertible Ford Thunderbird, Tanna looked cool, acted cool and took on any and all bad guys. And when there wasn't a job for Roth to be done, he took on other clients as well.

While Curtis only appeared in a few episodes at first and fewer later, there were plenty of guest stars on hand in this series. Each week another one had some problem for Tanna to take care of as well as several other guest stars either playing side characters or themselves as performers in town. The series also featured regulars in supporting roles including Phyllis Davis as an ex-showgirl and Tannas right hand woman Beatrice, Judy Landers as a bubblehead second assistant and Bart Braverman as Binzer, a prot&eacute;g&eacute; of sorts for Tanna. On the police force Tanna counted on Bella Archer (Naomi Stevens) when he needed information and Lt. David Nelson (Greg Morris) when he needed bigger help.

So what made the show special? Mostly the locations and the gorgeous people on display here. Urich was a handsome man and destined for leading man status. Davis and Landers were easy on the eyes. The scantily clad showgirls were on display long before the movie SHOWGIRL and with more on than that movie offered.

The neon signs and flickering lights of Vegas began each episode. This was the sin city every mother warned her son about and every son flocked to. We never saw the underside of the town or where the normal folks like blackjack dealers or waitresses lived, those would be on display in episodes of COPS years later. No here we got to see the good looking side of Vegas where the high rollers swept in to be courted and played losing money in the process.

Looking back what is truly interesting is the fact that the series captured Vegas as it was at the time. Having been there a few year after the show had been canceled it had changed in only a short period of time. And if you were to go there today it would look nothing like it did at either of those times. Vegas is a non-stop changing town.

There was never anything too serious about the series, no life shattering world in danger type story. These were stories wed grown used to and found comfort in when it came to mysteries and crime stories. They were stories that could be handled by a private eye and a few friends instead of the entire police force or military. Better than anything else is they were entertaining. It was the right combination of action, adventure, mystery and humor and it kept us coming back week after week but only for those three short years.

If you were a fan of the show youll be glad to find this box set available. The entire series, including the pilot which I was told was not available in the separate first season box, is on hand and for less than $50. So if this was one you loved then make sure you pick up this set, youll be happy to find it fits easily on your shelf.",1494892800,10,4063,4.518367346938776

Got this set... And it does have CC & SDH for the hard of hearing.  CC on season 1.  SDH on  season 2 & 3.
So you will need a DVD player that decodes CC & SDH... They are not the same thing.  CC will not go through your HDMI cable. Unless you have a new DVD player that will decode it. So it will go though it.

All shot on location in the Las Vegas casinos, on their properties, in their showrooms and in the city circa 1978-1981.  If you like Las Vegas then you'll get a kick out of seeing all of the casinos that have since been imploded, along with the stars of the time on their marquees'.  A real time capsule!  With the passing of the show's star Robert Urich, the beautiful Phyllis Davis ( who along with being an actress in many TV shows, was the long time girlfriend during the 70's of the ""Rat Pack's"" Dean Martin ) and Greg Morris ( of the original ""Mission: Impossible"" TV cast ), there won't be any actors reunion for ""Vega$"".

5126168,5,B0083TUE6A,"Great iconic drama that was light crime drama, unlike todays dramas that are heavy on blood and violence where you need to watch every week. Robert Urich was great in this role along with all his costars! great plots laced with Bart Braverman's (BINZER) humor and the toughness of Greg Morris (Captain Nelson). First season episodes featured Two Leaf ( the tall Indian actor from ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""), Tony Curtis, and eye candy Judy Landers ( who ended marrying DODGER relief pitcher Tom Niedenfeur, and still looks great today with 2 grown daughters). I love the back drop of Vegas and looking at the strip back then when there was the hotel with the giant ""SLIPPER"" on it next to the Frontier. And looking at who was hot back then by looking at the hotel's giant marquee signs. Popular Vegas entertainers would appear regularly like Wayne Newton and more. One episode featured Maureen McCormick (Brady Bunch) as a female tennis player with Robert Reed as her DAD ! Another starred a runaway teen played by Terri Nunn who later become a singing star for the New wave group, ""Berlin."" But my favorites were the ones with Dan Tanna in peril - blindness in one and addiction in another! You'll notice that after Judy Landers left after season 1 that Bea ( Phyllis Davis)  got all sexy on the show. She was rumored to be dating Dean Martin or some other big names in town when the series was filming. And Robert Urich and Bart Braverman would appear as themselves on ""Password Plus"" with Allan Ludden for a week! Before this became a series , Robert Urich made a TV pilot with Tom Selleck called ""Bunco"" that didn't get picked up! then we got ""VEGAS"" and ""MAGNUM PI!"" The VEGAS pilot is not here but if you get to see it, there were many changes made to the series!  Greg Morris"" Captain character had a different name, and the main hotel was the ""MAXIM"",not the ""DESERT INN.'",1455840000,34,1888,4.566371681415929

jumps and steps on the seats of that classic T-Bird.  But also the fact it was 23 years old then.",1453420800,17,429,3.9080459770114944

5126212,5,B0083TUE6A,So happy to have this collection when I watch it it brings back great memories of Vegas from the 70's before all the mega resorts took over and all the greed from the casinos took part. This show is set in a time where customers mattered and the bottom line was not what it is today.,1447372800,10,283,4.071428571428571

He drives a ""Vette"" has the usual buddies to help him. In otherwords it par for the course that the networks were taking during this period.  There were all kind of detectives going and coming on TV and this was one that lasted for a season and half.",1396483200,4,411,3.9156626506024095

8524675,5,B0083TUE6A,"I had forgotten how good this show was! The incomparable Tony Curtis is fantastic in his role as Dan Tanna's boss. A reasonably well written detective show but with great acting all around. Three seasons were all worth it aside from a few continuity errors. Eg. A bomb went off in Dan's warehouse home burning or destroying furniture and belongings. The next episode, nothing had changed. I write that off to production costs. Overall a fun show to watch with some great humor thanks to actor Bart Braverman as the character Binzer. Of course Robert Urich, may he rest in peace, never failed to bring it.",1528761600,,604,4.7075471698113205
8524676,5,B0083TUE6A,Great show for its time.  Amazing to see how much Las Vegas has changed over the years.,1528675200,,87,4.117647058823529
8524677,5,B0083TUE6A,"What a pleasure to see this again, one of my faves, Robert Urich died too young, I loved this show then, and it's still great now. A classic for sure with Bart Braverman, Greg Morris, Tony Curtis, Wayne Newton as himself in one episode and as a villain in another AND so many great TV actors from the 80s in different episodes.

And this show is certainly a blast from the past, especially fun seeing old Vegas, as it should have stayed, as now it has become such a commercialized touristy, family targeting town. The Frontier, The Dessert Inn, The Dunes,The Stardust....nostalgic
DVD quality is top notch too!",1528243200,,610,4.648148148148148
