7966183,5,B00006ADF4,"An effective film at conveying the idea that unnatural love, despite a perfect match, leads to disaster.

French acting, again touching on the expressive even, if not especially, in minute scenes, draws the viewer gradually in this tale of resonance of senses employed as an extension of the socially successful's deeply buried complexes.  I should remark that this film is part of an interesting genre in which the French business executive is nothing of the sort Ayn Rand planted in our collective mind on of this side of the Atlantic.

I wish the DVD transfer were of a higher quality. Also, some extras could have helped.  All in all, it's a sound film, don't skip it! (between 4 and 5 stars)",1374278400,,696,4.7272727272727275
7966184,3,B00006ADF4,Hitchcock would have loved this psychological thriller about a young man whose life is taken over by the wealthy businessman who hires him as his professional food taster.,1168387200,,171,5.142857142857143
7966185,4,B00006ADF4,Intelligent dialogues.  Might be slightly slow for the american standards but the subtility of Bernard Rapp's way of observing human behaviour is very interesting and well filmed.  Gireaudeau is excellent as often.,1092614400,,214,5.65625
7966186,3,B00006ADF4,"This movie played at the Seattle International Film Festival in 2001 and I happened to catch it.  The plot follows a wealthy, powerful business man and the waiter he hires to become his food taster.  A strange premise, but I thought, rife with possibilities.  Sexual undertones are suggested and a power struggle ensues as the employer tries to involve his new employee in increasingly bizarre activites.  Overall, an enjoyable movie, but definitely film festival fare.  The version I saw was French with English subtitles.",1033430400,4,523,5.178571428571429
