2886914,5,B000SKWG04,"I believe that Tony Horton created the Master Series as a bridge between Power 90 and P90X. I have many of Tony's programs (Power 90, Power Half Hour, P90X and Power 90 Masters) and the masters series are my overall favorite workouts of his.

There are 6 programs in it that give you tremendous variety and benefits.

Many of the programs are cardio based but also work lower body and core strength as well.

This program, Cardio Intervals, is less than an hour long and is made up of various calisthenic type moves. Each move is a minute long and you do three levels of intensity about every 20 or so seconds.

If you like Tony Horton when he's goofy and silly (which I do) then you'll enjoy him a lot in this and the other masters programs, he's extremely silly here. However, don't mistake his silliness for this being anything less than an intense workout, you work your butt off (which is why I appreciate the humor interspersed because it helps me laugh rather than cry! :).

This is the break down of the workout.

1. Warm up
2. Stretch
3. Run in place
4. Jumping jacks
5. Mary Katherine lunge
6. Squat kicks
7. Tires
8. Squat run
9. Water break
10. Wacky jacks
11. Planks
12. Run stance squats
13. Eagan brothers
14. Horton head hammer
15. Water break
16. Cool down stretch

 Tony is in a bright room with blue walls and a dark wood floor which I find gives a nice vibe (rather than the very dark room vibe of P90X). It's Tony and two fellow exercisers Dreya and Dan who often show modifications.

 Of of the many great things about  this workout is that you can just do the warm up, the first round and then the cooldown if you are not ready for the full workout, having a low energy day or just short on time.

 I always do the first round much more modified and then start to bring up the intensity level for round two. Everyone can really make this workout their own and Tony encourages you to do so.

 I highly recommend this program to those folks who are serious about getting in shape, are willing to work hard, but want to also have fun doing it!

 If you commit to this (or any exercise program), eat cleanly, you will get great results both in how you look, but more importantly how you feel!",1196553600,41,2211,4.3019323671497585

8205714,4,B000SKWG04,"I bought Tony's Power 90 5/6 after I finished 3/4 but didn't like it. It just didn't click with me, then I saw a video clip of this DVD and liked what I saw and ordered it. I really enjoy the setup and although I usually don't do the very slow movement, but do 2 intervals to his 3, I like most of the exercises and work up quite a sweat. Tony is ""Tony"" a bit goofy but he gets you through it with a smile...and if you aren't in the mood that day to listen, it gives you options for sound. I love how you can have him talking and music, no music or just his cue with music...so you hear him say when to change, but not the other chatter that gets repetitive at times.

All in all, I'm glad I bought it and it helped me lose 50 pounds along with Jillian, Amy Dixon and Jessica Smith.",1386633600,2,782,3.8875
8205715,4,B000SKWG04,"For people who need to east themselves back into working out, this is perfect.  This and the other Power 90 workouts got me primed up for P90X.",1295568000,2,143,4.296296296296297
8205716,5,B000SKWG04,"YogaDad's review is spot on. I just got done doing this workout, and it was excellent! There's the warm up, then the workout, then the workout repeated, then the cool down. You have the option of doing the workout only once, and then skipping ahead to the cool down if you'd like.

Both the warm up and the cool down are very thorough, and perfect to get you ready for this workout and to wind you down after the workout.

Like another reviewer, I enjoyed Tony's humor in this workout. During wacky jacks, he starts singing, ""It makes me happy, burning off my cookies!"" When I do this workout, I can't wait for it to come to that part so that I can sing it along with him. (Yes, I'm cheesy like that. Don't judge me!)

Each exercise is performed for 1 minute. Each one starts out with a beginner modification for 20 seconds. Then the crew moves on to the intermediate modification for the next 20 seconds. The advanced modification comes in the final 20 seconds of the minute. Tony constantly reminds you that you have the option of choosing which modification you want to go with for each of the 20 seconds. You can do the beginner modification for the whole minute if you want. There is a timer on the screen as you do each exercise, so you know when the transitions are coming. There is a main timer, that tells you how many minutes are left in the entire workout. Then there is another timer that runs for 1 minute, concurrent with each exercise, so that you can see when your next modification is coming for the particular move you're doing (at the 40 second mark and at the 20 second mark).

So, for example, one of the exercises is mountain climbers (aka plank runs). You start out in plank position, doing the move at a slow and controlled pace, bringing the knees into the chest one at a time. That's the beginner modification. Then you have the option of progressing to doing the move at a quicker pace, the run, bringing the knees into the chest a little more quickly. And lastly, you can go all the way down to the floor and do the Chaturanga Run (spelling?) for the last 20 seconds. 3 modifications, 1 continuous minute, then a super quick break as he describes the next move you'll be going on to. You make the workout as tough or as easy as you need it to be. You customize it as you go.

Tony's cuing is awesome. He is constantly giving form points, and encouraging you to make the workout fun.

This is an excellent workout and I plan to try the others in this series, as well.",1250121600,6,2494,4.352688172043011
8205717,5,B000SKWG04,"Can't add to much more to the already great reviews previously posted, other than Tony Horton has got to be one of THE most fun personal trainers ever!  This is my 4th dvd having him as an instructor and he's in top form as usual.  The workout is approx. 56 minutes long.  Tony starts you out with a warm up then proceeds to do 11 cardio interval segments, each lasting 1 minute.  He breaks each 1 minute segment down by 20 second sections...20 seconds of easy intervals....20 seconds of moderate intervals....and 20 seconds of in-your-face-go-at-your-hardest training.  Tony always emphasizes that you don't have to go really hard.  You can pace yourself and build up to pushing yourself.  Then after you do the 11 segments, you go and do them all one more time!  I sweat, get all out of breath, work my buns off, and still laugh out loud at his comical accents and comments.  This dvd is a great way to stay / get fit and have a good time while doing it.",1243900800,,956,4.448275862068965
