8478191,5,B005LKHABG,Hywel Bennett as Shelley was superb!  An intelligent comedy with a great script and good acting by all! .  The dialogue is so wonderful!  Hywel Bennett is such a versatile actor who can and has  played both  comedy and drama perfectly and this is indeed a great gift!  Watching this series again has brought many fond memories of the past!  They don't make them like this anymore!!,1354924800,,381,4.597014925373134
