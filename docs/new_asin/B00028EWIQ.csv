8023579,4,B00028EWIQ,"Although I'm not a Shaolin Kempo practitioner ( or never will be ). The presentation by Grandmaster Fred Villari and students is outstanding!!! Very detailed, very informative. However, I felt Master Villari could've been more detailed in his bonus features on ""White Tiger Chin Na"". I felt it was somewhat tepid, and far too vague!!!! The vendor did take their time in delivery, but in the end, it was worth it. Thanx",1449792000,,418,4.819444444444445
8023580,1,B00028EWIQ,"Can you learn basketball from a video? How about golf? Tennis perhaps?

As a multi-disciplined martial artist I did some research and found that indeed, Villari lost some schools (a lot?) in the NE as he was snookering people into buying franchises and paying him 10% of the gross. The problem was the franchises were illegal transactions and then when the buyer ran out of money they would try to strong-arm turning the keys over to Freddie to get out of what were illegal documents. If this were not true (you can find court details on the Internet) The old man could sue me. But it's true. He is ethically challenged when it comes to his business dealings. The court order him to pay and he lives in a homestead state of Florida and paid no one.

What is wrong with America is that you can be lied to about earning a black belt by looking in a mirror or by videotaping yourself. This should be illegal to sell. They don't grab you or hit back.

Take some judo classes, you'll be better off.",1401667200,4,993,4.385869565217392
8023581,2,B00028EWIQ,"This is a joke!  No one can ""earn"" a black belt through home study.  I can only assume that the other reviewers are either shills for Freddie or are seriously deluded.  From what I have seen of Fred's ""style"" I can give it two stars for being at least a form of physical exercise.  If you really want to learn to defend yourself or learn a martial art save your money and find a decent school.  [...]",1250726400,2,400,4.142857142857143
8023582,5,B00028EWIQ,"I had the great pleasure of studying under Fred Villari many years ago.  I was very excited when a friend mentionned that this set was available.  We watched his copy together, and I decided it was a must have for my own collection.

The lessons are demonstrated with the student in mind.  Everything is clear and the production values are superb.  I had the feeling of being back in a private lesson with Mr. Villari.

I have ordered my own copy and await its arrival impatiently. I highly recommend this DVD series to both the novice and the seasoned martial arts practionner.",1125014400,,578,4.617647058823529
8023583,5,B00028EWIQ,"Martial artists take a look!  Grandmaster Fred Villari's Shaolin Kempo-Karate system has been formatted into nine (9) DVD's illustrating the movements, techniques, and katas necessary to advance from White Belt to Black Belt.  The breakdown is as follows:

DVD#1: White Belt; DVD#2: Yellow Belt; DVD#3: Orange Belt; DVD#4: Purple Belt; DVD#5: Blue Belt; DVD#6: Green Belt; DVD#7: Blue Belt with Green Stripe; DVD#8: Green Belt with Brown Stripe; and DVD#9: Brown to Black Belt.

Grandmaster Villari guarantees this product with an optional promotion program requiring a student to record the testing techniques at each individual level and to mail it with a nominal fee for official recognition.  However, don't be misled.  This series can only be completed by serious students.

I have found the information and techniques included in these DVD's to be an invaluable source of Karate and self-defense knowlege.  Each DVD is recorded in clean and clear camera angles with actual Villari School martial artists performing the requisite techniques.  As a student of a Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) program, I finally found a comprehensive Shaolin program that I can rely upon to flesh out the Karate movements, and offensive & defensive tactics and techniques borrowed for use by other Martial Arts systems.  Grandmaster Villari also includes extra techniques and philosophies within each DVD, thus adding extra value to the program.

Although there is no substitute for actual ""hands-on"" Martial Arts instruction and sparring, the next best thing are these Villari DVD's.  I rate this DVD system at five stars with the recommendation to any prospective customer/student that they will not be disappointed with the content, quality or instruction proffered.  Well done!",1120780800,8,1762,5.410256410256411
8023584,5,B00028EWIQ,"I have been interested in martial arts for a long time; I have trained at several different schools.  Fred Villari is excellent and two instructors I have had consider him to be one of the best martial artist and instructors in the world.  My brother -in-law Thane Collins is a ninth degree black belt and studied under Mr. Villari years ago.  He has always spoken highly of Fred Villari and says he has never seen anyone better in 35 years of professional martial arts.

The style developed by Grandmaster Villari has influenced at least a hundred major schools and styles- his own schools have left a huge mark on the world of martial arts with dozens of masters and a couple thousand black belts.

I was originally skeptical of the Villari system because of its widespread success - I used to think it might have been too mass market or accessible and wondered how high the quality was.  After learning more about martial arts and speaking with masters and, most importantly seeing the amazing things that can be done with this type of system I realized that Villari's Shaolin Kempo Karate is a very high quality system.

I like these DVDs because they serve as a solid base to the system and can be practiced at any time.  The DVDs are nine full hours - which is a lot of content in itself.  The workouts can be done over and over for years - it would take a long time to master each DVD but they are also clear enough that you should be able to do most of the exercises and training right away.  Perfect for beginner, intermediate or advanced students.

It's also great to see Grandmaster Villari and other top instructors like Master Mark Gruposso actually doing the techniques.  I think the DVDs are inspiring because I know what a master in the Villari system is capable of and this set gives a foundation to move toward that goal.  I recommend these DVDs.",1120780800,10,1864,4.528358208955224

8023586,5,B00028EWIQ,"I've been studying martial arts for a few years now and I consider this DVD series an essential part of my training. You can't always get to the dojo, or ask your instructor to review a particular technique when you're practicing at home, so this method of remote learning is unbeatable. These DVDs cover every aspect of the Villari Shaolin Kempo Karate system.  They include every combination, form and technique.  There's plenty more, too.  Grandmaster Villari and his master instructors also include instruction on Chi Kung and Chin Na in generous detail!

In short, if you're interested in self defense training, check out this DVD series.  After watching them, I'm sure you won't be disappointed.",1103241600,5,701,5.060869565217391
