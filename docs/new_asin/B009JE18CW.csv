5342296,5,B009JE18CW,This is an excellent documentary on the lengths the State will go to harass peaceful citizens.  You'll be shocked to see how much of your tax money is wasted persecuting activists for things like wearing a hat indoors or not standing when our overlords tell them to.  This movie is packed with quite a bit of information and is entertaining and educational throughout.,1361145600,2,368,4.825396825396825
5342297,5,B009JE18CW,"""The people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world, are the ones who do."" That statement describes Derrick J and most of the people in Derrick J's Victimless Crime Spree.
Follow Derrick J's first year in Keene as he goes on his spree of victimless ""crimes"" in which no person was ever harmed (by Derrick). His first arrest was for filming in a court lobby. He was later wrestled to the ground, arrested and pepper-sprayed for having a dance party and his during his final arrest, KPD's Finton Moore hit his bicycle with his car door and shoved a nightstick into the spokes of his bicycle.
I've had the pleasure of seeing Derrick J's Victimless Crime Spree multiple times throughout the production process, and the movie is just as good every time I watch it. The director's cut DVD contains hours of extra footage from all of Derrick's arrests, two commentary tracks, a Q&A from the premiere of the film and much more.
You'll laugh, you'll cry and you'll be outraged at the people who made a ""criminal"" out of one of the most peaceful people you would ever meet.",1360454400,2,1079,4.56701030927835
5342298,5,B009JE18CW,"America could use more people like Derrick J.  He doesn't just talk the talk, he walks the walk.  As law enforcement continues to squeeze the boundaries and freedoms of its citizens, more people may be motivated to get involved in civil disobedience.  This film shows them what they can do and what to expect.  It's educational, yet at the same time, irritating to see how hostile and aggressive government ""employees"" have become.  For anyone looking to understand civil disobedience, this film's the ticket.",1360368000,2,509,5.0843373493975905
5342299,4,B009JE18CW,"I watched the Youtube version of this movie.  It's a great story of a young mans struggle with the ""authorities"".  It's a great story and well produced for a indie film.  It is amazing the things you can get arrested for in America today.  Can't wait for the DVD to come out.  I want to see the extras!",1360195200,5,302,4.137931034482759
5342300,4,B009JE18CW,"I, as someone familiar of the concepts of voluntarism/anarcho-capitalism, found this to be interesting although it was preaching to the choir.

Someone who is unfamiliar with these concepts might find it to be slightly presumptuous and conceited. I recommended it to a very-liberal friend of mine and he said he stopped watching because he couldn't get past the opening statement of ""refusing to be governed"" and rejecting government authority. Obviously my friend was not ready for this film.

I think this would be best for people who have been exposed to the concepts of liberty but need to see some hard examples of the irrationality/corruption/brutality of the state, even on a local level.",1360108800,,695,5.1415929203539825
5342301,5,B009JE18CW,"This movie is about activists that show their principles and show the violence inherent to the system. Derrick carried out acts of civil disobedience, and the great part about being alive today is that there are cameras everywhere- and this stuff gets recorded and published.

The pacing, the music, the narration- this movie is the culmination of so many good elements, well-put-together.

There long has existed the need for a thorough and coherent explanation of civil dis and it's finally here.",1359158400,,498,5.135802469135802

5342303,5,B009JE18CW,"For being a low-budget film, it is surprising how much footage exists of the events presented in this documentary. In many instances, multiple camera angles are available, and this film edits them together seamlessly and professionally. This work is equal parts documentary and personal narrative, and the two complement each other in a way that is rewarding and engaging to the viewer. Some of the footage that was shot on camera phones could have benefited from digital image stabilization in post-production to reduce the effects of motion sickness when viewing this film on a large screen, but overall Derrick J's Victimless Crime Spree survives the translation to the big screen surprisingly well.

I'll mention that you can view this film for free (with the blessing of the producers) on YouTube, but buying the DVD here on Amazon is a good way to extend the film's message to your friends and family who maybe would prefer not to watch a feature presentation on a computer screen.",1357689600,6,987,4.9818181818181815
5342304,5,B009JE18CW,"In a TED Talk titled ""Pay attention to nonviolence"" filmmaker Julia Bacha said:

""If we don't pay attention to these efforts [nonviolent protests], they are invisible, and it's as if they never happened. But I have seen first hand that if we do, they will multiply. If they multiply their influence will grow.... These leaders have proven that nonviolence works in places like Budrus [in Palestine].... Let's give them attention so they can prove it works everywhere.""

Derrick J's Victimless Crime Spree shines a bright light on the activism that Free State Project participants are doing in New Hampshire to increase awareness of the many injustices perpetrated by government today.

In the film we get to meet many members of the growing liberty community in New Hampshire and get a sense that they are very kind and welcoming. Derrick J says in the film how surprised he was to find that he felt right at home only a few days after moving to New Hampshire.

This film was made on a very low budget using a lot of amateur footage, but is still an enjoyable watch and contains some very powerful scenes.

One memorable moment was Derrick J getting arrested for his act of civil disobedience in which he held a small amount of marijuana and sang John Lennon's ""Give Peace a Chance.""

In my view it is insane that people still let ""government officials"" get away with committing these crimes (arresting peaceful people) without facing any consequences whatsoever.

Let's pay attention to the nonviolent activism being done in New Hampshire by watching this film and sharing it with others so we can create a more just and peaceful world.",1357430400,6,1637,4.825
5342332,5,B009JE18CW,"This is a great movie. It was informative, but still entertaining. The simple way he just stares facts instead of accepting the official vocabulary exposes the system. Also, it's fun to watch agents try to avoid simple questions.",1438819200,,229,5.052631578947368

5342339,5,B009JE18CW,"Derrick skillfully takes the viewer into his world of personal freedom. It's a world where he and his cohorts effectively challenge arbitrary institutional rules and biases. The viewer begins to understand how today's controversies and outrage over police brutality have come to be. One especially revealing episode has Derrick questioning a NH judge about why he sentenced a man to 5 days in jail for ""contempt of court"" for refusing to remove his hat in court. The judge is walking in a stairwell in a government building, and refuses to answer any questions. When the judge emerges into the main floor, he barks to a bailiff to detain Derrick: ""This man is threatening me."" It's all on film that Derrick didn't say anything that could be construed as anything close to a threat. This is an excellent documentary, extremely well done. It tells us much about our misperceptions about the freedom we have, and much about ourselves.",1438819200,,931,4.936305732484076

5342414,5,B009JE18CW,"This movie had a profoundly positive impact on me as I have re-examined our society in its current state. Derrick J brilliantly and bravely demonstrates what happens in the ""land of the free"" when peaceful people don't do exactly as told. It's funny, sobering, and at times maddening, as ""those calling themselves the government"" unwittingly provide endless evidence on camera that a system that gives one group of people the power to run the lives of another group of people will always end badly. Highly recommended!",1438732800,,518,5.034883720930233

Always good to see those who are in need of order being challenged as to it's authenticity and justifiability. No one in power should be that entitled.  I couldn't help but think that if these kids want to go up against the powers that be that they should at least have a civil rights lawyer to accompany them. Preferably one with similar conviction that can argue their stance of which, many times it appears, they were apparently unsure. It would help if this civil disobedience  were better researched so that the basic freedoms being disputed could be better stated examined and argued. Here you have civil rights challengers unsure of the ground they're standing upon being intimidated by street cops equally unsure of their legal footing. That escalating uncertainty only creates anxiety and the rash explosive behavior that leads to people getting hurt. Remember Kent State? We were to embrace, ""Yes we can"" while the darker side of things is ""no you can't"" and it still holds sway."" I'll always back youth and the indomitable spirit.

the best and empowering things I have seen. Derrick J is quite the
character and one of the most peaceful individuals I have ever seen.
For the most part, he doesn't do anything that any sane person would
consider illegal. The abuses of authority by individuals claiming to be
representatives of the government is sickening. If you think we live in
a free country, then you really should watch this. Government across
the nation is exerted its control over your lives, and I have so much
respect for the civil disobedience of Derrick J and the rest of the
guys(and girls) in Keene, New Hampshire. This has inspired me to start
non-violent civil disobedience here in my hometown. I encourage you to
check out the Free State Project as well that way you don't have to be
crazy like me and set up your own group. Again, great work and hope to
see more good stuff coming out of Keene, New Hampshire.",1362009600,5,965,4.426966292134831

Derrik takes us on his journey to the free state where he and other free state project activists are currently working to achieve personal freedom and liberty in our life time.

He was never threatening or abusive, not in his actions, language, or stature, so to see him repeatedly assaulted and abused by government agents made me cringe more than once. This exposes the true nature of The State, it is an inherently violent and immoral institution, employed full time in the business of assaulting and abusing people. After seeing this film, I was inspired to redouble my efforts to see the abolition of this institution.

It's also the most well produced piece of activist video in the history of activism.",1361232000,2,639,4.862385321100917
5342450,5,B009JE18CW,"It seems that most popular documentaries these days are 90-minute onslaughts of negativity. The world is going to overheat, your food is killing you, and so on. Derrick J's Victimless Crime Spree provides a breath of fresh air with giving the viewer someone and something to cheer for. It's a story that deserves to be told.

It quite fittingly begins with an interview with Aldous Huxley, whose Brave New World is perhaps even more prophetic than Orwell's 1984 in that violence is largely not needed to enforce the compliance of the masses; they simply need to be distracted by bread and circuses and they will accept or even ignore the fact that their liberties are disappearing. And so one may wonder just why Derrick J goes through the trouble of asserting his personal sovereignty in the face of law enforcement. Indeed, there will undoubtedly be those who believe he deserves whatever punishment the government decides to give him because of such foolishness.

But before condemning Derrick, we must consider what he is being punished for doing. His rap sheet includes videotaping in a courthouse lobby, dancing in a public park, lighting a marijuana pipe in public, singing carols in government liquor stores, wielding signs at political events, distributing literature on school grounds, and other heinous acts. In watching him commit these iniquities, one might decide that he was asking for it. But is it unlikely that someone also voiced the opinion that Rosa Parks asked for what she got? After all, all she had to do was move a few seats. Likewise, civil rights protesters should have expected abuse for doing sit-ins and marchers ought to have envisioned that they would have fire hoses unleashed upon them. They could have avoided all this. They brought this on themselves.

Yet nobody says that today. The courage of the non-violent protesters of the Civil Rights Movement is largely celebrated. Might it be the case that in the future, Derrick and those like him will be seen as the pioneers of a new civil liberties movement? As such, it is hard not to root for Derrick while watching this documentary. The way he conducts himself with dignity and patience towards those who would respond with gross injustices to him seems nothing short of heroic. His optimism and lack of bitterness leaves the viewer with an emotional attachment to him and the desire to continue following him and his efforts.

As for the documentary itself, the majority consists of actual footage captured during Derrick's activism and arrests. It is of surprisingly high quality considering the circumstances. While earlier parts of the film had me worried that much of the footage would be also be shot with a shaky hand, I was pleasantly relieved to see my concerns were unfounded. Uncharacteristic for a documentary, it was fast-paced and had my attention throughout.
