7435727,5,B015FR7N8Y,"Brian is the funniest man in the world . There is no longer any doubt. Since the field has been cleared of left ing critics posing as comedians.
Really hard for those left wing socialist to be truly funny because of their unrealistic politics and manic depression, hard to be funny when your without hope and spiritually null and void. I don't feel sorry for lesser types. Go Brian !",1454976000,3,383,4.485714285714286
7435728,5,B015FR7N8Y,So funny your face will hurt from laughing!,1454544000,,43,4.5
7435729,3,B015FR7N8Y,"I've seen him thrice times and this did not stand-up to those shows.  Maybe it's being in a crowd thing and stage presence.  Live is always better.  He is a premium comedian and puts out great writing and comes off as genuinely nice, which I'm sure is true.
Watch this if you've never seen him, you will see him after this.",1454457600,,323,4.262295081967213

7435734,4,B015FR7N8Y,"He is always funny.  He is a great and clean comedian.  However, I like some of his other work a little better than this one.",1452643200,,125,3.96
7435735,4,B015FR7N8Y,"It wasn't his best. I've been a long time fan of Brian Regan, but this left almost a little sad. Each joke has a cut off black screen before going to the next one...which might be great and seamless when listening, but when you are watching it? Annoying. It's like telling me to stop laughing, time for the next joke. Go and rent this, or better yet listen to it instead.",1451952000,8,371,4.23943661971831
7435736,3,B015FR7N8Y,"Brian Regan seemed stiff and stilted.  Our amazon rental was interrupted numerous times by a blank screen.  I don't think it was a streaming problem and seemed like deliberate editing or a copy write protection gimmick.  A little annoying.

That said, I give, ""Standing Up"" and his ""I Walked on the Moon"" 5 stars.  I'm a fan - just disappointed with this effort.",1451520000,,362,4.682539682539683

7435738,3,B015FR7N8Y,It was ok. Comedy is so hard to rate because it is  based on personal preference. For me it was mediocre but I know others that really liked it.  What I did like is he doesn't cuss in it and now a days that is a rarity,1514937600,,218,3.617021276595745
7435739,5,B015FR7N8Y,"He seemed to get off to a really slow start or maybe I just had to warm up to him since I have seen him before.  But but the end, his act was awesome.",1513987200,,150,3.411764705882353

7435741,2,B015FR7N8Y,"We did not care for this Brian Regan stand up. The material is a bit boring, kinda like he has run out of jokes. I have only watched it once, so its possible it might be better a second time but, I don't know. It was inexpensive at least.",1513296000,,238,3.877551020408163

7435744,3,B015FR7N8Y,"Brian Regan was one of the wittiest and animated comedians.  He didn't rely on the F-word to try and make something funny.  He is a true comedian.  Watch Epitome of Hyperbole to truly get his style.  Best stand-up.  This one, however, he looked exhausted, like he was trying WAY too hard and almost nervous.  Broke my heart to watch.  He and John Pinette are two of my absolute favorites.  We've already lost John. This one made me sad.",1507507200,,436,4.5

7435756,1,B015FR7N8Y,"Brian Regan is the BEST at what he does. He gets 5 Stars!!!
.
Major video PROBLEM.
The video has probably 30 to 50 blank/black screen interruptions that last from 1 to 3 seconds - all thru the live performance. It is NOT and edited thing between jokes, some get cut right in half.
.
Terrible and worst digital purchase from Amazon.
I thought it was internet connection related. But a second viewing of it on a different device (Fire tablet) roved that it is in the video.
Can I have my $ back OR PLEASE fix & simply edit out the problems... !!!!  'Cause we love Brian Regan's comedy.",1494633600,3,583,4.3

7435775,2,B015FR7N8Y,I've heard him on Sirius and thought he was funny. they must have pulled out the best clips. Neither my sister or I liked it and we have slightly different senses of humor. But...humor is very individual. Seems like lots of folks thought this was hilarious. Here's what I find crying-I-am-laughing-so-hard hilarious: Robin Williams' Weapons of Self Destruction. Ironically and sadly titled. Extremely funny.,1483920000,,407,5.375

7435785,3,B015FR7N8Y,"Brian Regan is probably one of my most favorite comedians, mostly because his comedy is family friendly - no cursing, no sexual jokes - but also because he is able to take seemingly boring every day life events and make them gut busting rolling on the floor laughing out loud funny!! The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars, is because it just didn't deliver like his bit about the Emergency Room or Poptarts, two of my absolute favorites.

We have even seen him live twice and he was great both times.  This is the typical Brian Regan DVD. You are going to laugh when you see it and then you will watch it again and laugh some more.
