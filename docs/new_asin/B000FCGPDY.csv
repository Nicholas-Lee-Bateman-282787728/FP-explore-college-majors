8120818,5,B000FCGPDY,Peculiarities of the National Hunt is a witty comedy addressing and dispelling the myths of a sometimes considered serious people.  The characters are hilarious from the start.  A true gem.  It is said that if you understand this movie and find yourself curled over in a ball laughing till you cry; you probably have a Russian Soul. (Please see 4000 pages of literature on what the Russian Soul might be). This is a great movie and sure winner with anyone who has raised dairy cows!,1261526400,,482,4.647058823529412

8120820,5,B000FCGPDY,Another funny movie from Russia.  Directed by the guy who did the Peculiarities of the National Fishing.  I loved the dream sequences of the Finn and the contrast with what was actually going on.  Especially as they end up hunting a cow.,1216166400,,237,4.595238095238095
