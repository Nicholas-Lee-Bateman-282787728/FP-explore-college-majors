8486812,5,B005UFTAWE,A true song and dance man.  Also I loved watching him put on his make up and his costume while talking to the audience.  It was a real treat to watch him.  He looks so comfortable on stage and he makes it look so easy.  He still looks good.  I saw him on an old episode of Law and Order Criminal Intent and he looks very handsome.  I enjoyed watching him in a movie with Timothy Hutton back i the 80's I believe.  Thats entertainment for sure.,1406332800,,443,4.022988505747127

Make the effort to see him when he is in your area.  This was a memorable time.  Thanks, Hal!",1393113600,,243,4.690476190476191
8486814,4,B005UFTAWE,"It's very hard to believe that Hal ""Barney Miller"" Linden is eighty years old after seeing this video of his new show ""I'm Old Fashioned."" I loved the wonderfully nostaligic music, and the often funny and warm stories he tells of his amazing career.

With a surprisingly strong voice and energy he croons American songbook standards and belts out Broadway blockbusters like a performer in his prime. He tells the story of how he got started in show biz from big band clarinetist and singer to Broadway star. Two songs that really stood out to me were ""Just in Time"" from ""Bells Are Ringing"" (made famous when he sang it to Judy Holliday on stage); and ""In My Own Lifetime"" from his Tony-Winning role in the musical ""The Rothchilds."" It's fascinating when he applies the ""old age"" stage make-up for that song, then chants it out with such power and depth.

With over twenty Broadway shows and a Tony Award to his credit, he chagrins that all he really wanted was to be Benny Goodman. Then, backed by a really top flight swing band, he plays a fine tribute to the jazz master.

Even though this is a concert, all of the songs fit nicely with story. My only beef about the live performance recorded for DVD was that it felt a bit too skimpy on my TV for this enormously talented man. Would love to see it live!",1320537600,10,1307,4.460251046025105
