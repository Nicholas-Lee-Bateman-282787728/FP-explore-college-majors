I remember when I first saw this movie.  I instantly loved it, got it on VHS and my friends and I watched it regularly.  It was one of the ""girls night around the TV with popcorn"" movies.

Is it for everyone.  No.  If you have been hardened and jaded by the grittiness of today's films, this lighthearted fare won't please you.  But if you want to experience the fun of the eighties, this is a perfect film.

BTW, to the reviewer that had not heard of Robby Benson, look him up.  Not only did he have many films that did well, he moved to voice work. The Beast in Beauty and the Beast. You know, Disney.  First animated film nominated for Best Picture Oscar. Then he moved to directing.  Ever hear of Ellen, Friends, 8 Simple Rules, Dharma and Greg; he directed episodes of all of those and others.

He is currently teaching and writing.  Multi-talented.",1277337600,4,937,4.316091954022989
293367,1,6300271749,"Calling this movie terrible is an understatement. Who the heck is Robbie Benson? Judging by this movie, in which he stars, co writes, co produces and composes it's all too obvious why you haven't heard of him. The 'barber shop' folk song at the beginning will have you ejecting your lunch, you almost wish Jason Voorhees would show up and hack him to pieces. I've seen a lot of lousy movies in my time. This ranks as one of the worst.",1025308800,4,434,4.37037037037037
293368,5,6300271749,"I remember seeing this when I was very young, and for some reason the memory of this movie never left me. Seeing it for the first time in twenty years, I now can say why that is. For one, it is just pure and simple fun. And two, Robbie Benson's hilarious dead-on slap stick. Most importantly though, are the songs. WHY WAS THERE NO SOUNDTRACK FOR THIS FILM EVER PRINTED? Could it be that Benson's film suffered from very poor advertising, and pompous critics? Obviously! You can tell that Robbie really put his heart into this movie. His original music will stick in your ears long after the credits roll, causing you too to wonder why this music exists only within the confines of this video tape. Robbie was obviously expecting more, and it is a shame the studios didn't do enough part to bring that vision to light. Linda Grovenor gives a charming performance alongside Benson, and her screen presence is reminiscent of Carrie Fisher. If you enjoy a good, fun, '80's style romp, this one is for you.",998438400,26,1002,4.572222222222222
293417,5,6300271749,"From the first time we ever watched this, we have totally loved loved loved it!  AND yes, we almost died laughing.  The songs have become favorites of ours (especially Mr. Weinstien's barber shop).",1386720000,,197,4.9393939393939394
293418,1,6300271749,"I was so happy when I saw this great movie in the DVD format.  I have
an old VHS copy but I wanted to step up to a DVD.  But when it arrived
I was so upset and irritated.  It has been butchered.  When a movie
comes in a wide screen format you expect to see more of the film than
in the narrow full screen format.  When they make a modern film in
to a full screen movie you lose a lot of the movie because they cut it to fit
the square screen.  But what they did to this film is take a full screen
version and just cut a few inches off of the top and a few inches off of
the bottom to make it look like its wide screen.  It a scam!  So now not
only is there a lot of the film cut off of each side, there is more cut off of
the bottom and top.  Its a total rip-off! This movie is five stars but this
butchered version is one star!",1382054400,5,828,3.5810055865921786
293419,3,6300271749,"I remembered this as a fun movie--with some great music.  I know my taste's become more jaded with the sophistication of present-day entertainment--but I did enjoy the sojourn into the past, & still was really pleased with the ""light rock"" kind of ""folksy"" music scattered throughout.",1377129600,,284,5.173913043478261
293420,3,6300271749,"This isn't the lost classic that other Amazon reviewers are claiming but it's a mostly enjoyable, if extremely silly comedy-thriller, a genre that was popular briefly in the late 1970's with movies such as Silver Streak and Foul Play.  The plot involves a cabbie and wannabe rock singer (Robbie Benson) who picks up a college professor who is being pursued by assassins and ends up with a wooden box containing a very smart monkey that a lot of dangerous people want.  Die Laughing only has a handful of real laughs but between the monkey, Robby Benson's budding romance with an adorable tom-boy played by Linda Grovenor and Bud Cort's wonderfully quirky turn as a wealthy nuclear-physics major who really, really wants to be a Bond villain, Die Laughing's cuteness factor is very nearly off the charts.  The film's biggest flaw by far are the songs.  The filmmakers aren't going for intentionally bad songs like Ishtar, and the songs themselves aren't exactly terrible--the Jim Croce style singer-songwriter tunes might have made for acceptable album filler in 1973.  But in 1980 when this movie was released the songs were already hopelessly dated and time hasn't made them any better.  If we're going to sit through so many songs performed by Robby Benson from beginning to end it would have been nice to have stronger ones to listen to.  Die Laughing is one of the movies that helped to kill Robby Benson's film career, which is a shame because he was an underrated actor and this is a generally fun film.",1375574400,,1509,4.825581395348837
293421,5,6300271749,Love Robby Benson in this movie. Glad it came out in widescreen after so many years. He has a great band in the film and the songs are great also. Should have been a soundtrack. Story is good and movie is good.,1371340800,,210,4.023809523809524
