1369355,5,B00004XQPC,"Okay, I've purchased a couple of Glock DVDs before.  Why?  Well, it never hurts to watch a 75 minute video of stuff you already know as you'll probably get a good 10 minutes of new information from it that you really didn't know.  I own a Glock 27, 23, and 22, so I'm certainly a fan of these firearms (and caliber)!  I also own a SIG and Beretta, but the Glock collection gets the most exercise because they are just so much fun and less expensive to maintain.

First, the disassembly portion of this DVD was outstanding!  It was slow and detailed, perfect for future reference.  But the video also talked about basics that are always worth a refreshing, such as shooting posture and self defense aiming strategies.  If you own any Glock model, this will be the best DVD you can purchase to gain a better understanding of the operation, cleaning, and total disassembly.  I also recommend ""Advanced Concealed Carry"" as a companion DVD for more instruction on concealed carry specifically, however I would suggest you purchase ""Mastering the Mini-Glock"" first for a complete understanding of the weapon and generally how to use it before jumping into the ""advanced"" training.  Why buy a book that you'll probably never read?  Get this video and start practicing!",1168992000,25,1261,4.791666666666667
1369356,5,B00004XQPC,"This covers it all.  Very detailed with lots of close up pictures.  It covers shooting tips and techniques, complete disassembly and reassembly procedures, cleaning and maintenance, concealed carry, and self defense shooting. Lenny Magill takes you step by step through the Glock model 27. It is the most complete resource available for Glock mini size handguns.",1106092800,7,362,5.446428571428571
1369357,5,B00004XQPC,"If you are considering any of the Glock subcompact semi-automatics, this video will show you why you should make the purchase. If you want an overview of the disassembly and the reassembly of these pistols, this video is for you. If you want to see how this line of self defense pistols can be used and how to train yourself for such use, this video is worth owning. Done by a fellow name Larry Magill, it is well presented and reasonably comprehensive.",1086393600,10,453,4.536585365853658
1369358,5,B00004XQPC,"(Also available in DVD) If you are considering owning a Glock subcompact pistol or need some help with the plethora of modifications, this is the one video to buy. CCW and shooting tips, complete disassembly and reassembly clearly explained. While it does not go into Glock mods, it will teach you how to take the gun apart. Very well done.",1083801600,,340,4.683333333333334
1369359,4,B00004XQPC,"I expected this video to discuss handling and operating characteristics peculiar to the Mini Glock line of pistols.  Two of these were presented: the need to press the thumb against the back of the slide while re-holstering the pistol in order to prevent it from moving out of battery (don't know if the Glocks are the only pistols with this requirement; my Colt .45 auto doesn't experience any problems in this regard) and the lack of grip length to accommodate the entire hand, requiring the pinkie finger to be curled up under the grip bottom (no solution was given for this latter situation other than a recommendation to purchase one of the after-market grip extenders).  Nevertheless, I liked this video very much for the general information that was presented on self defense shooting skills and drills.  For this portion of the video alone (which occupied the majority of the video playing time), I would recommend it to novice defensive pistol shooters.  I also liked the section of the video showing the disassembly of the pistol.  Although I have a manual with pictures of the disassembly steps, I like seeing these steps in a video as an adjunct to the manual.",1060560000,9,1172,4.84
1369360,4,B00004XQPC,"I bought this video with fairly low expectations that it would give me the information I needed to ""master"" the mini-Glock, but the video met its title statement.  The sections on concealed carry techniques and draw from concealment were excellent.  The disassembly/reassembly information was adequate that I was able to disassemble the slide and receiver assemblies to their lowest common denominators and reassemble them successfully.  Mastery is a good word to describe the feeling when you know every part, how to get at it, what it does, and how to put it back.  With the video and some practice (on my G19, G23, and G27) I am quite comfortable with all levels of disassembly.  Maintenance suggestions were good but varied some from my Glock Armorer's manual in lubrication placement.  In fact, what the Armorer's Manual calls ""the most important drop of oil"" is not mentioned by Magill.  This is the drop specified where the connector and the trigger bar meet.  Other missing information includes testing the trigger, firing pin, and drop safeties and the check routines to run after assembly to assure that everything is functioning properly.  Overall, the video is a nice addition to the Armorer's manual to make the assembly and disassembly operations easier to understand, but it is not the complete and final word.  The combat marksmanship hints are excellent and I learned from them.  Just the hint of covering the back of the slide with the thumb while reholstering the weapon might be worth the cost of admission.  Recommended.",1011571200,21,1541,5.047430830039525
1369361,5,B00004XQPC,"This Video greatly surpassed my expectations.  I was mainly interested in getting a better description of the 'complete' Diassembly (down to the bare frame) and Re-Assemply of a Glock - which this Video was excellent at.  What I also got was an exceptional decsription of Personal Protection techniques, firearm handling techniques, concealed carry options, and very good information on general gun maintenance.  A winner...",997660800,18,424,5.59375
7926275,5,B00004XQPC,"Lenny is good in front of a camera.  Clear instructions, great Glock field strip instructions for cleaning.  A must have.",1487548800,,121,5.0
7926276,5,B00004XQPC,Very helpful video. I especially like the assembly / disassembly portion.,1456617600,,73,5.7272727272727275
7926277,5,B00004XQPC,"A wonderfully orchestrated instructional video.  Perfect for beginners.  Mr. Magill, definitely knows his stuff.  I recommend it to novices, as well as experts.",1362355200,,160,5.869565217391305
7926278,4,B00004XQPC,"Lenny does a fine job illustrating the basic points of firearms control and safety. The methods not only apply to the mini Glock, but any handgun.
What surprised me - and this is what I consider to be the best part of the DVD - was the disassembly instruction at the end. Very detailed, and wonderfully captured on camera.
Great job Lenny!",1332028800,,339,4.483870967741935
7926279,4,B00004XQPC,Nice video. Very detailed on the cleaning and handling of the Mini Glock. Def recommend for beginners not familiar with this firearm.,1302998400,,133,5.090909090909091
7926280,5,B00004XQPC,"Good for first time Glock Owners; also have a good basic introduction on draw and shoot. Glock maintenance and cleaning. Good enough for me. Since when I bought this tape I was a beginner in shooting and a first time glock owners.
Aside from that if you are a seasoned shooter and familiar with standard glocks this tape will not be so impressive.",1227830400,,347,4.523809523809524
7926281,3,B00004XQPC,GREAT DVD BUT IT'S OLD .I FOUND THE SAME DVD ON EBAY FOR 20 $  OVER PRICED DVD,1219363200,2,78,3.3333333333333335
7926282,5,B00004XQPC,"Lenny Magill provides excellent information on handling your Glock pistol safely, as well as displaying how to completely disassemble and maintain your weapon.  He gives many tips on defensive shooting and concealment methods. The video is thorough and professional. Lenny Magill is an expert in defensive protection.",1215475200,,317,5.74468085106383
7926283,5,B00004XQPC,"Excellent video!  The section on disassembly and cleaning was superb!  I'm a first time gun owner and I was able to easily follow along, disassemble my G26, clean it, oil it and re-assemble it with no problems!  With this video, I feel like I've truly mastered my mini-Glock!  :)",1209081600,2,279,4.63265306122449
7926284,4,B00004XQPC,"I found this video very interesting and easy to watch. It shows that with a lot of practice, you can be as good as this guy is, and he's pretty good. The concealment part was helpful, especially the reholstering technique he uses with his thumb on the rear of the slide. I would have liked to have seen more holster options explored, as there are many to choose from. The breakdown of the Glock was was the best part of the video, as it was shown in great detail, which is hard to see using still photos you find on the internet. Using the barrel to hold the firing pin when you are taking it apart was a very good tip, as it's tricky to do. This video could be applied to all Glock models, not just the Mini (I have a G26, G17 and G34). He did forget to lubricate the important connector, which could have been a simple oversight, which is why I rated this 4 stars instead of 5. Always follow the Glock's Owner Manual for lubrication spots.",1187049600,,941,4.204419889502763
