2472269,5,B000CS45OW,"We really enjoyed this movie.  She is a really good actress.  I enjoy seeing her in movies that have good positive outcomes... although this one keeps you on your toes at times, it is good.",1379376000,,189,4.371428571428571
2472270,5,B000CS45OW,"To Brave Alaska is another well done adventure with Alissa Milano.  Years ago I purchased Goldrush: A Real Life Alaskan Adventure on VHS and recently on DVD (a true story about a young NYCity girl that made it in Alaska).  To Brave Alaska is also based on real-life adventures.  Since I purchased the movie, I've shared it with my adult children and they also enjoyed it.  It was well worth the money.",1365638400,,401,4.527777777777778
2472271,3,B000CS45OW,"This is supposed to be a true story. While the scenery is great, the acting good and story good, did they really plan to live the with the clothes they had with them? Jeans, which are cold in winter, thin , for winter, coats. This put me off the movie.",1364515200,,252,4.06
2472272,5,B000CS45OW,Not an academy award winner but a good story with wonderful actors. Alyssa Milano is beautiful in this role and the characters tug at your heart,1358380800,,144,4.576923076923077
2472273,4,B000CS45OW,Based  on  a  true  story  about  a  couple  who  choose  to  live  out  in  the  Alaskan  wilderness.  You  can  say  that  it  is  similiar  to  other  survival  stories  except  for  the  fact  that  they  were  not  out  there  by  accident.  It  does  show  how  they  worked  together  to  survive  a  very  unforgiving  territory.,1287705600,3,337,4.39622641509434
2472274,4,B000CS45OW,"I've lived in Alaska and know what a vast wilderness it is.  This is a true story and I have no reason not to believe the facts.  However, the
story line was a bit short on facts. The premise of the last half of the story was the rescue.  Although I don't have first hand knowledge of the events of the rescue, well, when it was found out that two kids were lost in the wilderness, there would have been aircraft of all kinds involved. The Alaska search and rescue, the National Guard, C.A.P and others whould have been involved. The idea that one aircraft and one
helicopter and a boat were the only ones looking is absurd.",1234310400,,624,4.271186440677966
2472275,5,B000CS45OW,"Inspired by a true story, TO BRAVE ALASKA stars Alyssa Milano as one half of a young couple forced to fight for their lives in the Alaskan wilderness in the 1970s. Tired of their careers as a policeman and a waitress, Roger and Denise pack up their bags for Alaska, where they plan to live a less structured life. But this idyllic fantasy is quickly shattered by the devastating reality of getting lost in the Alaskan rough. With no one to save them, the couple must depend on each other if they plan to survive.

For the Milanoer ....good addition to the collection.",1152230400,12,567,4.504854368932039
2472296,3,B000CS45OW,Not Alyssa's best work.  A little cheesy in parts but an okay film.,1463788800,,67,4.153846153846154

Thank you for explaining this to me so I could waste my money.",1445644800,,155,3.727272727272727
2472301,3,B000CS45OW,ok for what it is. too much drama,1444003200,,33,3.25
2472302,4,B000CS45OW,Very good,1441152000,,9,4.0
2472303,3,B000CS45OW,it's ok and the fact that it is a true story is cool!,1439424000,,53,3.1538461538461537
2472304,3,B000CS45OW,"Where was the bear??? I kept waiting for the bear to appear, and nope, no bear! I like adventure movies and this one was good. It is entertaining. It won't win an Oscar but I didn't fall asleep!",1436745600,,194,4.131578947368421
2472305,1,B000CS45OW,There are lots of excellent survival films and documentaries. This movie is not one of them. Their real life story deserves a better tribute. Dont waste your money.,1430265600,,164,4.892857142857143
2472316,2,B000CS45OW,"Through this entire movie I couldn't help but feel these are the stupidest people in the world . Every decision was the wrong one .It was based on a true story about Denise and a man Roger .I so hope this poor women has moved on from this idiot of a man who almost got her killed .I admire her will to survive but please move on . I sure hope they made a buck on this movie .Last but not least I like Alyssa Malano but in this movie she just tried to hard to act probably because this film had nothing and she knew it . The leading male who ever he is should stick to the lifetime movies or better yet catalogue modeling for the mens section in Sears and Roback .

  I feel bad that this happened to these people and if they made a buck off this movie good for them .",1429142400,3,767,3.872611464968153
2472317,3,B000CS45OW,Nice story... we live the outdoor life...someone from the city would not notice the errors...,1429142400,,93,5.266666666666667
2472318,5,B000CS45OW,"I love this movie,i had recorded it on VHS back in the day when they played it on TV (since it was a made for TV movie) and then back in like 2007 when i started to download movies from Sharaza to replace my VHS movie collection to put on to black DVD's,i couldn't find this movie on there (which is normal,cause finding the made for TV movies on Shareaza is impossible).So i found it here on Amazon and bought it using my $5 gift card i got from using Bing.com :)",1428451200,,464,4.054347826086956

2472320,2,B000CS45OW,"Sorry to say this movie was very lame. Too much kissing, where is the action?? I actually threw the movie in the garbage after watching.",1423872000,,136,4.48
2472321,5,B000CS45OW,I enjoyed this film and the condition of this DVD was outstanding. Thanks.,1418428800,,74,4.769230769230769
2472322,4,B000CS45OW,Saw this movie years ago. I'm a fan of Alyssa Milano and so I had to get it.,1405555200,,76,3.2777777777777777
2472323,3,B000CS45OW,"I've been a fan of Alyssa Milano ever since her ""Who's the Boss?"" days, and bless her heart, because I guess this little movie was the best her agent had for her that month.  She and Cameron Bancroft play a couple who get left out in the cold, literally, at their temporary housing for their temporary jobs in the very isolated Alaskan bush, then head for civilization after some miscommunication about who was supposed to bring their next batch of food and supplies.  It's really another case of, if you get lost, stay where you are, but of course, they didn't; otherwise, there'd be no movie.  It's definitely good to know that there was a real-life couple who managed ""To Brave Alaska"" and made it out alive.  It's just too bad that this movie didn't do justice to their, I'm sure, extremely desperate and dangerous survival story.  The acting is fine; it just didn't stir my emotions and didn't have as much white-knuckle suspense as you'd expect, leaving something to be desired (I also wondered why they ate toothpaste because, hungry or not, toothpaste can definitely be harmful if ingested).  It's just good enough, but you'll probably be more entertained with an ""I Shouldn't Be Alive"" episode.",1394841600,,1203,4.78743961352657
2472324,5,B000CS45OW,A very touching movie.  The boy and girl where at each others troats all the way through.  A great family movie for everyone to watch.  Read at the end of the show that the boy and girl didn't stay together but are still friends.  Wish they had stayed together.,1384819200,,261,4.26530612244898
2472325,2,B000CS45OW,"The movie sucked.  By the end of the movie I thought all the characters were idiots except for the dog.  If the real life dog actually stuck it out with this couple the dog deserves a loyalty medal for above and beyond.

I thought the acting was good.  I thought the visuals were good.  The script sucked and the actors portrayed the couple as if they were a couple of morons who ended up hating each other by the end of the trip.  I hated the two main characters by the end of the movie and was not surprised that they went separate ways.

I had an old canvas covered wooden canoe just like the one in the movie.  I have been out in the water in Northern Michigan in December.  It was truly a miracle that this couple survived, but, no one with any experience in winter boating or any sense at all would have tried a minimum 150-200 mile canoe trip in December.  Don't get me started on trying to climb a mountain in Alaska in Dec.

I have been in northern Lake Superior in the summer when I was backpacking on Isle Royale.  The movie does not talk about how biting cold the water would have been in Alaska in December and January.  There is a river crossing scene where they both should have died from exposure.  If half the stuff this movie shows this couple doing is accurate the fact that they lived is a true miracle.

I tried to imagine my late wife and I being as stupid as this couple was and I can't.  I would never have left the cabin.  If my late wife had insisted, which she wouldn't have, I would have destroyed the canoe.  I literally developed an intense dislike for these characters, and I like both of the actors.

If I had to guess from this movie, the couples anger and hatred for each other was all that kept them alive.",1379721600,9,1741,4.205438066465256
8101442,4,B000CS45OW,"We watched two movies tonight. I fell asleep watching an old movie called the ""Call of the Yukon"" but I stayed awake for this one, yelling, they should have chosen an orange or a yellow tent. How did they get their clothes dry every time? I guess we are supposed to imagine it but I kept wondering, was this the part that was dramatized to keep our attention? You have to keep asking, what was the real story? When you come to the end and it says the actual couple went their separate ways, that is the most incredible thing of all. How could a couple go through a life and death struggle and not be bonded for life? Makes me think they really didn't go through all those harrowing experiences. Nobody has any eyewitness account of the rescue? Nobody was interviewed? No actual newspaper clips or TV reports? I like to watch episodes of ""I Shouldn't Be Alive"" and I can accept that people survive in unbelievable circumstances but this is one that would have to be proven to me.",1494201600,,978,4.4088397790055245

8101446,1,B000CS45OW,"Hilariously HORRIBLE movie. My husband and I laughed the whole way through, and it wasn't supposed to be a comedy! The acting is hilarious, the stupidity of their decisions is alomost annoying, and it was poorly executed. We didn't regret watching it, because it was entertaining, to say the least- But won't be watching it again!",1470441600,,330,4.910714285714286
