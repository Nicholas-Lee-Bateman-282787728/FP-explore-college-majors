8130842,4,B000GDH8OM,It is a matter of taste: I love drums....I found their style very unusual and interesting....,1438819200,,93,4.875
8130843,3,B000GDH8OM,"I agree with another reviewer: musically this dvd is excellent (5 stars), but the editing is terrible (1 star). Basically every few seconds in the performance, there is a shift to a different camera angle. Maybe they were just trying to be artistic, but this approach ultimately doesn't work. My recommendation would be to purchase portland taiko's excellent cd or see them live instead of purchasing this dvd.",1424736000,,410,5.044117647058823
8130844,5,B000GDH8OM,"I have to give this DVD five stars, just because the energy and vibrancy of the Taiko performance shows through despite the odd camera work.  Often, when a drummer was moving, the camera would cut to another shot.  It was very frustrating to not see the drummers complete the move.  Yet, when the drummers were stationary, the camera would hold a long take.

I wonder why the overhead camera shots were not used more often when the drummers were moving in patterns.

Although this DVD cannot capture the excitement of a live show, it is a good substitute.

I hope that this video helps to promote the artistry of Taiko drumming, and Portland Taiko in particular.",1264118400,3,662,4.663793103448276
8130845,5,B000GDH8OM,This DVD is fantastic.  I would recommend it.  It is fun to watch.  Taiko is such a visual musical style that it is great to be able to watch it.,1166659200,2,145,3.7666666666666666
