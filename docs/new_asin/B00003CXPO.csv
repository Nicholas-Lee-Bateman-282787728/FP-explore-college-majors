1285819,5,B00003CXPO,Just finshed seeing Men Of Honor and I must say that I loved it because it is a great movie to see with a loved one. I thought De Niro and Gooding were great in this movie so if you are in the mood for a great movie then this is for you.,978134400,,237,3.490566037735849
1285820,4,B00003CXPO,"George Tillman Jr's blatantly syrupy and corny cinematic voyage into the tumultuous naval career of America's first African-American Master Diver Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding Jr.) is an excessively blunt and fairly obvious attempt to felicitate massive emotions from the audience through another predictable man against the world formula. Essentially a rehash of any underdog coming-of-age sports movie (Rocky, Karate Kid, Rudy,) Men of Honor takes a typically idealistic but class challenged character and puts him through the paces of trying to prove himself in his own mind and, in spite of his ethnicity and personal background, validate his cause upon the hearts of others.  As the audience follows Brashear on his predestined path, we meet a typically callous and hard-hitting commanding officer Master Chief Billy Sunday played marvelously by the always-authoritative Robert De Niro. Sunday is another stock De Niro character that is hot-tempered, violently impulsive, alcoholic, loud-mouthed, aggressively defiant against authority, and haunted by his human frailties on a daily basis. Through this unlikely union between these drastically varied men, Brashear eventually finds the will, determination, and persistence to succeed in the military amidst the initial resistance and eventual encouragement of Master Chief Sunday.
Including an all-star supporting cast comprising Hal Holbrook (Mr. Pappy), Carlize Theron (Gwen Sunday), Powers Boothe (Captain Pullman), and Michael Rapaport (Snowhill), Men of Honor supplies the acting muscle necessary particularly in the leads to upgrade what could have been a gooey dramatic hokum into a sound military period piece that still slightly disappoints, by supplying more  sentimentality than film needs, in remaining entirely real throughout.
When this well-acted tale reaches DVD, I hope it contains a George Tillman Jr. commentary track, theatrical trailers, making-of documentaries, and much much more. If you're a fan of De Niro or of military period pieces than definitely by all means check it out.",976147200,11,2055,5.7344262295081965
1285821,4,B00003CXPO,"Even though at times, Men of Honor was a little too melo-drama for my taste, Cuba Gooding Jr. is wonderful as Carl Brashear in this spectacular film starring opposite Robert DeNiro in one of a great performance (as usual)! A breathtaking film that is destined for the OSCARS! Not to be missed!",975110400,3,293,4.653846153846154
1285822,5,B00003CXPO,"Why do you think Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding Jr. are academy award winners? Becuase they deliver!  A true story, great plot and story line, emotions skyhigh! A totally great movie! It has my bessing of ""Thumbs Up all the Way!"" A++++++",974592000,4,238,4.534883720930233
1285823,5,B00003CXPO,"A dramatization of the life of Carl Brashear, the first African-American diver in the history of the U.S. Navy, ""Men Of Honor,"" directed by George Tillman, Jr., is an uncompromising examination of  personal courage, integrity and honor.  Cuba Gooding, Jr. portrays Brashear, a man of unabashed determination who simply would not be deterred from achieving his goal, even in the face of apparently insurmountable obstacles, the most prevalent of which was blatant racial discrimination.  As brutal and incomprehensible as it seems, there were those, including at least one high-ranking officer, who would rather have seen him die than pass diving school.  That he stayed with it, passed and went on, not only to an illustrious career with the Navy, but one in which his achievements were nothing less than remarkable, is a demonstration of heroics tantamount to those for which medals are awarded.  It's men like Brashear that should make veterans everywhere proud of their heritage as members of the Armed Forces.  Such a story is, of course, a natural for the movies; and, if done properly, has the makings of a great one.  And this one is.  Tillman tells the story of Brashear, the son of a Kentucky share cropper, in a decidedly straightforward manner, without pulling any punches as he illustrates the inane bigotry faced by the young seaman.  The heroics of the man speak for themselves, and Tillman wisely avoids any attempts at superfluous dramatic embellishments, the siren's song to which a lesser director may have succumbed, and which could so quickly have derailed this project.  Tillman's work more than passes muster, and his attention to detail, along with impeccable pace and timing, are a major factor in the success of this film.  It should land him an Oscar nomination.  Another factor is the incredible talent with which Tillman had to work.  Gooding embodies the qualities that made Brashear a hero, and it is through his outstandingly credible performance that we get to know this man.  There's a subtle pride in his demeanor, a personification of his determination, that brings him so vividly to life on the screen; it's an Oscar worthy piece of work that should be acknowledged by the Academy.  And Gooding had, not only a terrific role, but the best co-star with which an actor could hope to work.  Robert De Niro stars as Master Diver Billy Sunday, the adversary turned ally who ultimately helped Brashear realize his goals.  On the surface, Sunday is tough and pridefully simplistic; but underneath lies a complex individual that De Niro mines to full advantage.  Any time De Niro appears in a film, expectations are high, as well they should be; he is an actor of immeasurable talents.  And here, with his portrayal of Sunday, he scores another triumph.  It's a brilliant performance, for which he must be recognized with an Oscar nomination.  The outstanding supporting cast includes Charlize Theron (Gwen), Aunjanue Ellis (Jo), Hal Holbrook (Mr. Pappy), Michael Rapaport (Snowhill), Powers Boothe (Capt. Pullman), David Keith (Capt. Hartigan), Holt McCallany (Rourke), Joshua Leonard (Isert), Carl Lumbly (Mac, Carl's Father) and Lonette McKee (Ella, Carl's Mother).  ""Men Of Honor"" is a superb, memorable film that recognizes the kind of heroics that go largely unsung and too often unheralded.  That Tillman and this fine assemblage of actors have been able to illuminate the life of a man like Carl Brashear so fervently is a tribute to them as well as the Motion Picture Industry.  But more than that, it is a well deserved tribute to a true hero, Carl Brashear.  This is a movie that must not be missed.",974160000,11,3638,5.023333333333333

1286028,3,B00003CXPO,This is a good true story.  Cuba Gooding Jr.  plays the charector of the black to become a Navy diver.  He over comes all kinds of racism and other obstacles.  Robert DeNiro and Hal Holbrook are nearly as good.  As  two of the officers who are doing everything they can to keep him from succeeding.  And Charlize Theron in a small role as DeNiro's wife is beautiful.  This is a good inspiring movie.,1509148800,,399,4.36986301369863

1287728,4,B00003CXPO,"Seems like there are a lot of 5 star votes recently that are likely bogus to bump up the overall rating of this movie.  I just watched it and being based on a true story, I give that a lot of respect as the real Carl Brashear certainly deserved it.  I'm giving it 4 stars for that although as a movie it's really more like 3.  I think the current overall 4.5 star rating on Amazon is inflated like I said.  The movie itself is just ok although I certainly appreciated the underlying subject matter.  Robert DeNiro does a decent job and Cuba Gooding is just ok.  I'm not a huge Cuba Gooding fan as an actor and this performance is pretty typical for him.  I personally know an actual Navy diver and it really is true how dangerous a job it is.  He has lost several good friends over the years.  The ongoing training is just as dangerous, if not more, as what they do.",1460246400,,866,4.168674698795181

1289094,2,B00003CXPO,"The 'good news' about this film is that it's based on the true story of the first African-American to serve as a Navy diver. Brashear (Cuba Gooding) grew up in a poor farming family and joined the Navy to better himself. Brashear's first assignment was a ship's cook; determined to move up he declares that he will become a master diver and manages to become assigned to driving school. There he encountered and overcame strong racism - both at the instructor and fellow trainee levels. How - via heroic actions.

The bad news is that the film is as formulaic and predictable as night following day. Because of its formulaic nature, the film is boring - regardless of however true it is.",1438300800,,687,4.631147540983607

1291281,5,B00003CXPO,"Last night's bargain-rack movie was ""Men of Honor"" Starring Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding, Jr. I found it in the five dollar bin at Wal-Mart. It was a good movie and a fine bargain. The movie was an inspiring and uplifting story of an African American young man (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) who joined the Navy in order to fulfill his dream of becoming a Navy diver. It began in the early fifties when President Harry Truman had ended segregation and the Navy was now open to any race. Well, it was open all right, but if you were an African American, that meant you could be a part of the cooking gallery. Becoming a diver was out of the question. You just weren't qualified, and there were a lot of people to see that you didn't get a chance.

Understanding the whole segregation thing was always difficult for me because I grew up in areas of the U.S. that were fully integrated. I remember that our High School (Boulder, Colorado) had an African American student (out of about 650 total students). I'd spot him from time to time and there didn't seem to be any significant problems. The University of Colorado had African American students enrolled and a number of them were in the sports programs, especially football. Everything seemed to be peaceful, but from time to time you'd hear some nasty racial slurs and none of the the African Americans could join any of the fraternities or sororities. It was just out of the question. The whole racial segregation thing didn't really fully hit me until I attended a Geological Society of America Meeting held in New Orleans in 1965. I was somewhat amazed at seeing the back of busses reserved for colored people, and then there were the colored drinking fountains. But I think the thing that struck home the most was a Billips Service Station. On one side of the bright white building were three doors. One was labeled men, one woman and one, the farthest back, was labeled colored. The building itself was sparkling bright white ceramic blocks, except around the colored door. Both the door and the blocks surrounding the door were stained and filthy and looked as if they hadn't been cleaned in the history of the building. I could only wonder what the interior of that little room might be like.

Well, things like this have largely vanished. Haven't they? Well, at least I don't see anything of the sort. In any case, if you are curious to know what the conditions and attitudes were in the fifties, this is an excellent movie depiction. If you didn't live through this period, you may think this is just a movie fantasy. It isn't. And this was the environment faced by Gooding's character as he strived to serve his country as a Navy diver. De Niro played Gooding's next in command, and did an excellent job. His attitude was totally negative in the beginning, but Gooding completed his almost impossible tasks one by one and gradually, but reluctantly won his commander over. It's a good story. Quite uplifting. Five stars. Trust me.

1291282,5,B00003CXPO,"This is a movie about a man who wants to become one of the elite Navy Master Divers and it is based on a true story.  Just getting selected to go to the training takes effort and determination by Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding Jr.),  He also has to overcome racism and he has to not only meet but to exceed the standards required to become a Navy diver.  You see, he is trying to become the first black man to even become a diver, let alone a Master Chief.

As the movie starts, Navy divers are trying to locate and recover a lost 50 megaton nuclear bomb that was dropped by a USA aircraft that was ditching in the Mediterranean Sea. Master Chief Petty Officer William Sunday meanwhile sits in an airport with two military police setting by his side as they escort him back for deserting.

Brashear overcomes many obstacles to become a diver.  His education stopped when he was in the 7th grade because he had to work on his family's farm in order for them to be able to live there.  The farm work made him a strong and tough man but he lacked in his formal education.  He had to study extra hard to pass the tests required of a Navy diver.

Brashear finds out that the Sunday is the training head instructor at the school that is located in Bayonne, New Jersey.  Brashear knows Sunday as they served together on the same ship.  Brashear is there when Sunday risks his life to save a drowning diver and that is what inspires him become a diver.  Brashear enlists the aid of a beautiful woman studying to be a doctor to help him pass the tests.  She is his strength as he struggles through the diving school......

This is an excellent movie and both Cuba Gooding Jr and Robert De Niro do excellent jobs portraying their roles in this film.  I enjoyed the movie.  The inspiration I learned of by watching the story of a brave and tough man, Carl Brashear, was motivating.  The relationship between Brashear and Sunday grows throughout the movie and makes this story a good one to watch.  I recommend it to you.",1347062400,,2006,4.375675675675676

1291438,4,B00003CXPO,"It's true that President Truman integrated the military, but of course it was not that simple. Carl Brashear, a black sharecropper's son who joined the Navy in response to a recruiting sergeant's promises, finds himself in the galley. He's told there were only two jobs for a black man in the navy: cook or a white officer's orderly.

But he's a great swimmer, and has the guts to apply for diving school. After two years and hundreds of letters, he is admitted. These are the deep sea divers with the big suits and hoses that go to the surface, looking like something out of Jules Verne. Of course it's very tough, especially with the dirty tricks of the bigots, but he graduates.

Then one day an airplane lost a nuclear bomb in the Atlantic Ocean, and Brashear is sent to retrieve it. The dive is harrowing enough, especially when a Soviet submarine shows up. But he finds the bomb and it is being hoisted aboard the recovery vessel when an accident sends a steel cable with its mounting bracket whipping across the deck, nearly severing Brashear's left leg.

So he's retired out on disability, right? Wrong. This is a man who simply does not give up. An inspiring story and superb performances by Cuba Gooding, Jr., as Brashear and Robert DeNiro as the officer named Billy Sunday who says that the only difference between him and the evangelist by the same name is that he IS god!

Hal Holbrook also appears as the totally bonkers commander of the diving school. It's never really explained why he had not been retired to a psychiatric hospital years earlier.",1336694400,,1563,4.6521739130434785
1291439,4,B00003CXPO,"I have always loved this film.  Cuba Gooding Jr. is a highly underrated and under used actor and Robert DeNiro gives a performance here that is more than a mere caricature of his wise guy films over the last few years.  I have had the standard definition DVD of  Men of Honor , the Special Edition, for some time.  A fine DVD and I looked forward to even better with the Blu ray version.  On blu ray, the video transfer is fine with no artifacting, showing deep details in the shadow scenes and excellent coloration.  The audio tends to be a bit inconsistent.  The audio will definitely give your sub woofer a workout in some of the underwater scenes, especially when the practice ship shifts on its ledge as well as when Carl's line is caught up by the Soviet's sub.  It is during these scenes that the surrounds, both front and back, as well as the sub really come to life and pop. However, there are many other scenes where there is little use made of the surrounds when they well should have.

Often the extras on a DVD are audio commentary, trailers, ads for other films and, if you're lucky, a deleted scene or two.  However, the standard special edition DVD of Men of Honor was filled with many excellent deleted scenes as well as commentary for why they were deleted.  This included a heart breaking scene where a dog is cleansed with lime because Cuba Gooding's character had touched the dog.  The explanation for its deletion was included as well as many other extras.

However, the Blu Ray version of Men of Honor leaves out all these wonderful and valuable extras.  All you get is the audio commentary and trailer.  Additionally included is some sort of pop up trivia which you can set to come up as the movie plays but no individual interviews with the actors, no commentary by Carl Breshire himself, no deleted scenes.  You get just the initial theatrical release and thats it.  So for me, this 5 star film only gets 3 stars as a blu ray, thus my average of 4 stars.  I will be keeping both the standard and blu ray editions as the extras on the standard really were excellent.

All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.
Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.

It truly is obstacle after obstacle on different levels so the hero is constantly trying to prove himself or get through something but there were enough lulls in between where it didn't feel like there was no breather room to appreciate his accomplishments. De Niro does an awesome job playing a reckless, know-it-all whose destructive behavior gets him into trouble after trouble, including when he tries to help Gooding's character pass the Navy Diver final exam amid rampant racism. Most of the supporting cast is good enough but a few are a notch or two below what one would expect. That said, this is a great film if you want a ""pick me up"" tale of someone with dogged determination who possesses a sympathetic background. The play off between Gooding and De Niro is quite good. A focus on a part of the Navy that most people don't know about was intriguing. Cynics might find it sappy or melodramatic for their tastes.

1291528,3,B00003CXPO,"It's funny because last night I was kind of formulating how I wanted to phrase this review and the first thing that came to mind was `by the numbers' and then this AM, when talking to a fellow Ammy friend (cough*MKIA*cough) he mentioned that a certain biopic was NOT `by the numbers'.  I just find that humorous.

Maybe it was a sign.

So, `Men of Honor' suffers from that very clich though.  It is, for lack of a better phrase, very `by the numbers'; to the point where they fictionalized a character to create an even more `by the numbers' feel.  Your standard biopic consists of `average man or woman overcoming obstacles to do something above average'.  Some of these `standard' biopic films can overcome that generic approach by technical merits and acting that transcends the minimalist approach.  Other films suffer from appearing too simple and overly formulaic and thus wind up too forgettable.

I think that is the problem with `Men of Honor'.

As much as the overall story itself is one of inspiration, it comes across as slightly cheap in production and overall impact.  The acting is decent to good, but never more than that.  De Niro does give us something more in parts, but his clich ridden character (he is the fictionalized character in the story) doesn't seem to find enough footing to remain grounded.  Cuba Gooding Jr. is one of those actors who just don't always work.  His memorably fantastic work in `Jerry Maguire' seems more and more like a fluke with every performance I see from him.  He is effective here, but nothing more than that.  He never wows me.  The beautiful Charlize Theron has some moments, but nothing that transcends stereotype and Aunjanue Ellis seems like an afterthought (as does her storyline).

When you look at `Men of Honor' as a made-for-TV `movie of the week' (which it certainly feels like), then it becomes more palatable.  The film is far from bad, and it has moments of uplifting inspiration, but overall it fails to really deliver what it is capable of.  Instead it relies on a ridiculous amount of clichs and borrowed themes to create something we've seen done a million times before; much better at that.",1274918400,,2162,4.7479892761394105

Cinema Release: November 16, 2000

Rated on a 5-star scale. USA. 129 Minutes. Directed by George Tillman Jr. Written by Scott Marshall Smith. Starring Cuba Gooding Jr., Robert De Niro, Charlize Theron, Aunjanue Ellis, Powers Boothe, Hal Holbrook.

First, start with the true story of an African American man's triumph over the odds of racism and hardship within the then-institutionally racist 1950's American Navy. Next, using creative license, sprinkle on a few stretches of the truth for dramatic effect. The finished product: a riveting, yet fact-based docudrama, right? Wrong. Men of Honor, although it has the best intentions at heart, can't help but fall flat--not because its source material isn't inspiring--but because its execution of this source material is so predictable and chock-full of over-the-top melodrama that one can't help but lose the ability to take Men of Honor and the issues of race it presents seriously.

The film, serving as an account of the life of Master Chief Petty Officer Carl Brashear, the U.S. Navy's first African American Master Diver (and later, the first diver to be reinstated as an amputee), naturally acts as a biopic: it kicks off with a snapshot of Brashear's childhood as the son of a poor sharecropper family in Sonora, Kentucky. Promising his father he will ""not end up like him,"" Brashear leaves his home to join the recently desegregated navy, and later on, with the permission of Captain Pullman (Boothe), the commanding officer of the navy, enrolls in Diving and Salvage school. There, Brashear faces racism and bigotry from his fellow students, diving instructor Chief Billy Sunday (De Niro), and Commanding Officer Mr. Pappy (Holbrook), all determined to see him fail. What ensues is a flurry of ""inspirational"" segments demonstrating Brashear's determination to overcome any challenges besetting him, eventually leading to the climax of the film--where Brashear, left with one leg due to an accident on ship, has to walk 12 steps in a 290-pound diving suit to prove he is worthy of reinstatement into the navy (by this point, audiences will probably be able predict the film's outcome).

Although a decidedly un-inspirational execution of an otherwise uplifting story, Men of Honor, as a technical film, isn't half bad. First and foremost, performances are stellar--despite mushy scenes such as Brashear's proposal to his wife (where he yells after her in a taxi) and her acceptance (where she jumps out of the taxi and into his arms)--the all-star cast always manages to keep audiences at least a little engaged. Additionally, in spite of criticism for being too boyish for the role, Cuba Gooding Jr.'s young appearance and adolescent voice suits the character rather well--for it is Brashear's child-like optimism, hope, and unabashed defiance towards authority that endears him most to audiences. Next, the film's cinematography, commandeered by Anthony Richmond, employs mellow, subdued colors and plenty of close-up shots--making the film much more reminiscent of soap opera TV than of your run-of-the-mill cinematic epic--however this more realistic-looking style is found to be more suitable for the documentary-element of the film and great for capturing naked, unembellished emotion from actors.

Being a docudrama, the film naturally had its fair share of historical fallacies and dramatizations of the truth: Brashear's on-screen childhood, once undergoing further research, is found to be almost completely fabricated--Brashear is depicted as a single child whose drive behind his dream of being a navy diver is to fulfill his father's wishes for him to live a better life--when in fact Brashear was one of eight children in a loving home whose motivations were not so dramatic; in one interview stating, ""I always dreamed of doing something challenging...When I saw the divers for the first time, I knew it was just what I wanted."" Furthermore, the brazen manner in which Brashear negotiates with the commanding officer of the navy, Captain Pullman, to enter diving school was also pure fiction; Brashear didn't encounter severe opposition until after he entered diving school. The most disappointing and elaborate invention of the film, however, is the entire character of Master Chief Petty Officer/diving instructor Billy Sunday, played by Robert De Niro, who serves as the main antagonist of the film and opposition to Brashear's dream of becoming a Master Diver himself, and is, frankly the most intriguing character of the film.

All in all, Men of Honor, as stated, is a lackluster take on an otherwise moving true story, injecting its source material with so much melodrama and fluff that one wonders whether or not a successful docudrama can be made without consisting of a minority of distortion instead of a majority. Unless you'd like to be disillusioned with the entire genre, it's recommended you go watch something else.",1244073600,,4924,5.256997455470738

1291627,5,B00003CXPO,"An essential film on the history of the US Navy and the integration of the first blacks ... in the kitchens, and then the integration of the first Black as deck personnel and later as US Navy Diver. It was not easy. But we must note that the dedication on the sleeves of the DVD is absurd. It says ""History is made by those who break the rules."" In fact the ostracism against this first Black diver goes against the rules that come from the Commander in Chief, the President of the US who ordered the integration of US armed forces. In fact some officers who are living in their racist traditions can actually give an order to drown the black diver and this black diver is graduated because the training officer decides to disobey the order from this commanding officer because it goes against his code of honor for which all US soldiers, sailors or pilots or whatever are equal in front of the flag, the national duty and the constitution. History in this case is made by those who decide to disobey orders from bigot officers, in other words to abide by the real constitutional rules. The film is slightly romantic in a way when it shows how this Black man is really doing more than his share of good and courageous acts and is often side-tracked and rejected, even for a medal he actually deserves that is yet given to some other white diver. Effective in its emotionality but yet only emphasizing the human side of things and not the political back-side of them. It sure cracks down on the Washington pencil-pushing bureaucrats who write the rules and regulations of US armed forces though they hardly know what real field courage can be because they never had, nor looked for, the opportunity to meet with a death-bringing mission. It is true that today the racial problem is no longer so much to be accepted when Black as to be respected as having the same stamina, courage and spiritual force as the whites or any human being, in other words we are no longer dealing with tolerating them with a smile but with accepting them as being equal, hence as having the possibility to be better. From toleration to possible superiority.

Brashear is the son of a hardworking farmer who wants his son to be more than he ever was. He joins the Navy with his own dreams of moving up in rank but unfortunately he lives in a time when black men aren't even allowed to swim in the same waters on the same day.

1291727,4,B00003CXPO,"This is a wonderful, heartwarming film, as well as an indictment of the US Navy at a certain time in history. The story is a cinematic, biographical sketch of Carl Brashear, the first African-American to become a diver for the US Navy. Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Robert De Niro both give Oscar calibre performances in this gripping film.

The movie tells the story of Carl Brashear, whose parents instilled in him a determination that would cause him never to give up his dream of becoming a diver in the US Navy. He stuck to his guns, despite the overt racism that he encountered when he joined the Navy. The racism that he encountered would make it harder for him to achieve his life long dream.

Once he became a diver, Mr. Brashear upped the ante and strove to become a master diver. He struggled to do this against all odds, and just when he was on the cusp of achieving his goal, a tragic accident befell him, derailing him temporarily from the path to his ultimate goal. What he then does to fulfill his dream is radical, yet inpirational.

Cuba Gooding, Jr. gives a perfomance so moving and heroic, that the viewer feels like giving him a twenty one gun salute at the end of the film. Robert De Niro plays a racist master diver who is ultimately converted to the side of the angels, when he realizes that Carl Brashear is truly the best of the best. His performance is stellar.

The only problem with the movie is that most of the supporting roles pale in comparison to the two central ones played by Gooding and De Niro. Charlize Theron's role, that of De Niro's wife, is really superfluous to the story. Aunjanue Ellis, who affectingly plays Gooding's wife, has a more crucial, pivotal role than Ms. Theron, but remains a shadowy figure in the backround. Hal Holbrook's portrayal of a loony, racist Navy commander is rather one dimensional, more of a caricature than a character.

Cuba Gooding Jr. enters the Navy with all good intentions but the lingering effects of a segregated military, even though recently abolished, weigh heavy on him. Military traditions good or bad are hard to break. Robert De Niro plays a Southern bigoted washed up Master Chief in charge of training at the U.S. Navy's diving school. Ordered by commanding officer Hal Holbrook to fail Gooding, De Niro begins to learn the real meaning of honor as shown by Gooding's determination and perseverance at insurmountable odds. Perhaps Gooding's conduct possibly rekindled in De Niro the recognition of those qualities that defined and are the very essence of honor in De Niro's burdened psyche.

If you ever have the feeling that you want to quit or give up on something you should watch this film for inspiration.

Unfortunately, today, we lost this great man.  I have attached the story from CNN below.

RICHMOND, Virginia (AP) -- Carl M. Brashear, the first black U.S. Navy diver who was portrayed by Cuba Gooding Jr. in the 2000 film ""Men of Honor,"" died Tuesday. He was 75.

Brashear died at the Naval Medical Center Portsmouth of respiratory and heart failure, the medical center said.

Brashear retired from the Navy in 1979 after more than 30 years of service. He was the first Navy diver to be restored to full active duty as an amputee, the result of a leg injury he sustained during a salvage operation.

""The African-American community lost a great leader today in Carl Brashear,"" Gooding said of the man he played alongside Robert DeNiro, who was Brashear's roughneck training officer in ""Men of Honor."" ""His impact to us as a people and all races will be felt for many decades to come.""

In 1966 Brashear was assigned to recover a hydrogen bomb that dropped into waters off of Spain when two U.S. Air Force planes collided.

During the mission Brashear was struck below his left knee by a pipe that the crew was using to hoist the bomb out of the water. Brashear was airlifted to a naval hospital where the bottom of his left leg was amputated to avoid gangrene. It later was replaced with a prosthetic leg.

The Navy was ready to retire Brashear from active duty, but he soon began a grueling training program that included diving, running and calisthenics.

""Sometimes I would come back from a run, and my artificial leg would have a puddle of blood from my stump. I wouldn't go to sick bay because they would have taken me out of the program,"" Brashear said in 2002 when he was inducted into the Gallery of Great Black Kentuckians. ""Instead, I'd go hide somewhere and soak my leg in a bucket of hot water with salt in it -- that's an old remedy I learned growing up.""

Brashear faced an uphill battle when he joined the Navy in 1948 at the age of 17, not long after the U.S. military desegregated.

""I went to the Army office, and they weren't too friendly,"" Brashear said in 2002. ""But the Navy recruiter was a lot nicer. Looking back, I was placed in my calling.""

Brashear, the son of poor sharecroppers in Sonora, Kentucky, quickly decided after boot camp that he wanted to become a deep-sea diver.

""Growing up on a farm in Kentucky, I always dreamed of doing something challenging,"" he said. ""When I saw the divers for the first time, I knew it was just what I wanted.""

In 1954 he was accepted and graduated from the diving program, despite daily battles with discrimination, including having hate notes left on his bunk.

He went on to train for advanced diving programs before his 1966 incident.

""He kept to himself personally, but his military life was an open book,"" said Junetta Brashear, his first wife, who lives in Portsmouth, Virginia, near Brashear's home in Virginia Beach.

She said Brashear's health started to deteriorate about three years ago, but that he had experienced problems ever since the amputation.

Brashear married childhood friend Junetta Wilcox in 1952 and had four children -- Shazanta, DaWayne, Phillip and Patrick -- before their divorce in 1978. He later married Hattie R. Elam and Jeanette A. Brundage.",1153872000,3,3613,4.665615141955836

This movie is the quintessential 5-star movie.  I read the reviews below and the editorials above and was surprised to find criticism; I disagree with all of it and can simply find nothing negative to say about ""Men of Honor"".

I tried to remember the profanity that is mentioned in several reviews; I'm not sure if I have a different version, but I don't remember any profanity!  I'm sure there must have been some, but apparently it was so inobtrusive and fit in with the story so well that it passed me by.

The movie is the true story of Carl Brashear, the first African American to become a Master Diver in the Navy.  It shows the terrible prejudice of the time (the 1950's and 1960's) in the military and the rest of our society. Carl Brashear was single-minded, totally focused, and struggled to achieve his goals, overcoming almost unbelievable adversity.

I found the movie entertaining and inspiring.  I too was left wanting to know more about Carl Brashear and the military at this time.  Fortunately, my Special Edition of the movie included special features that included director's comments, a film introducing you to the real Carl Brashear, deleted scenes, and information about how the movie was made, etc.  If you are the type of person that enjoys these things, I would highly recommend this version.

The acting was as good as I've seen, with Cuba Gooding Jr. playing Carl Brashear---they identical in real life (when you see the actual pictures of Carl Brashear at that age on the special features).  Robert DeNiro was outstanding, as was Hal Holbrook and the many other actors, including Charlie Therzon.  I disagree with one reviewer who said her character was ""extraneous""; her part was perfect and she played it perfectly, adding entertainment value and beauty to the movie.  Besides, the movie is not about her character, but about Carl Brashear, so although she is a movie star it would be inappropriate in this true story to give her a central role.

The whole movie is quality, and gives you a quality experience watching it. It is very entertaining.  It is filled with postive values, from Carl's family of origin, to his own family (for example, he waited until he was married to sleep with his wife..oh my!), to his handling of everything he did in an honorable way.  We don't have a lot in our society today that reflects honor. In addition, it leaves you with encouragement for your own life and the relatively small obstacles most of us have to fact compared to what someone like Carl Brashear faced.

This story needed to be told, and it was told well.

1291865,4,B00003CXPO,"""Men of Honor"" was another excellent film but it left me wanting to know more. It was the fact-based story of the Navy's Master Diver Carl Brashear. He was the first black man to attend and graduate from Diving School. Cuba Gooding Jr portrayed Brashear who at a young age decided he wanted to be a diver for the Navy. BUT when he entered the Navy blacks were only allowed in the kitchens.
After coming to the attention of his CO, Brashear was given an opportunity to attend the school he really wanted to. He came face to face with Billy Sunday played by Robert DeNiro. In many ways Sunday wanted to see Brashear complete the course but his commander portrayed by Hal Holbrook tied his hands. Eventually Brashear was successful.
As Brashear's career progressed, Sunday's fell apart. Then there was a terrible accident, which resulted in Brashear losing a leg. The Navy wanted to retire him but he fought to stay in. Sunday came to his aid and helped him recover from the amputation. He was by his side when Brashear had to go to court to fight for the right to stay in the Navy. The court scene was very moving.
Yes there was a little romance in the movie and yes there was vulgarity but this film was very good. However it left me wanting more so I will have to go find of copy of the book the movie was based on to learn more about this amazing man's life.

This film is so much better than the sum of its reviews.
First, the story--face it, it deserves to be told.  This is about a real man who goes through the tenth level of hell and back to achieve his dream of becoming a Master diver.  He has to face bigotry from his classmates and his superiors--the latter of whom are determined to fail him based on his skin color alone--and push himself past his limits to succeed.  Yes, the plot was hokey in some areas, but a few hokey spots does not a bad film make.
Second, the acting.  Only Cuba Gooding, Jr. could have pulled off the role of Carl Brashear, the diver in question.  His performance was very well executed and brought me to tears in spots.  Robert De Niro was wonderful as always, and I really don't care that Billy Sunday was a composite of Brashear's superiors throughout his career instead of a real person, because he pulled it off without a hitch.  At times he reminded me of R. Lee Ermey, but the role would not have had the same depth if the latter had been cast--it was written for De Niro.  The supporting cast was excellent as well--especially Charlize Theron and Aunjanue Ellis, whose roles, although small, were nonetheless pivotal.
The DVD version, both wide and full screen, includes a feature about--and narrated by--Carl Brashear himself, who was the head military advisor to the film, and it is definitely worth watching.  I myself was amazed at the accuracy of the movie and was deeply inspired by this man who had had so much to overcome.  George Tillman, Jr. did a wonderful job with his story.
Overall, I give it five stars out of five.  If you thought this film was complete crap, then maybe you should go rent ""Gigli.""  Criticism aside, though, ""Men of Honor"" isn't so much a biographical feature as it is a testament to the strength of the human spirit, and Carl Brashear is living proof.",1073433600,9,1981,4.612535612535613
1291867,5,B00003CXPO,"I don't know where to begin with this movie.  Carl Brashear's story is one of the most powerful commentaries on ordinary men doing extraordinary things.  After watching this movie, you'll feel emboldened to do anything.  This movie is similar to Apollo 13 in that it captures that spirit of rugged individualism that makes America great.
In terms of cinematic performance, Cuba Gooding and Robert De Niro turn in some of the best performances of their careers.  This will be a classic with a timeless message for future generations.",1054512000,2,532,5.011363636363637
1291868,3,B00003CXPO,"This is a good bio and De Niro and Gooding, Jr. are fine in their roles, but there just isn't anything new here. If you know nothing about Brashear - after the first 15 minutes of this film, you will be able to develop a remarkably accurate scenario for the rest of the film.  Enjoyable, but directed with such predictability that that the sentiment seems overblown and the man's accomplishments seem diminished. Too bad - because the real man was probably mighty inspiring.",1041811200,2,474,4.710843373493976
1291967,3,B00003CXPO,"First I'd like to say that the movie was entertaining and the acting was great.  What made the story  interesting was that the main character was attempting to become the first black Navy diver, not that the subject of Navy diving is itself interesting enough to make into a full length feature.  It is the stuff of one hour documentaries on the History or Discovery Channel.  But here we have the conflict of the old boys school and the civil rights movement and a man with a goal, to become a Master Diver in the U.S. Navy.
It is perhaps a sad commentary on the American viewing public that in order to sell a movie that had at its base a fascinating story line; the movie had to include a lot of embellishment.  While I don't know the actual facts as they happened and perhaps no one has the memory to tell the tale completely; I do know ""acting"" when I see it and I do notice the ""dramatic elements"" thrown in to make the story more ""Hollywood"".  Those elements were a disappointment in an otherwise good movie.
I think the strongest statement the film makes is about fathers.  Mr. Brashears father tells him as he is about to board the Navy bus that no matter how hard it is going to get, and it will be hard he tells him, that he better not quit and he better never come back.  I don't know how much truth and how much fiction was included in the story version of the relationship between the Brashear father and son, but in the end I think it makes the strongest point of the movie.  It it isn't as important, in the long run, whether one is white or black, rich or poor, what matters is how strong the influence of your father was and if he was indeed a ""Man of Honor"".
This movie is a good inspirational story, and one that teens thinking about their futures could gain some enthusiasm from, which brings me back to my original complaint; I wish that the movie had followed the real story faithfully and told it like it was.  I think it would have made a better movie to not have the cardboard characterizations that were included in many of the roles.
Even with my complaints I still recommend this movie, it is entertaining and there still lies a powerful and true message.",1037491200,,2184,4.330882352941177
1291968,4,B00003CXPO,"This is the story of Carl Brashear's career as a US Navy Diver in the bad old days of the 1950-1965 time period, when black men were pretty much not wanted by the US Navy except as cooks or valets.  But Brashear is simply the best, and he overcomes this dreadful prejudice.  That is what this story is about.
Cuba Gooding Jr. does a powerful job portraying Brashear.  De Niro's performance as the racist southern Master Chief is so realistic it almost has to be seen to be believed. His eventual friendship with Brashear is inspiring, and is the best part of the movie.  Most of the other characters in the story are minor, but in this case that's OK.  This is a really fine movie that will shame us all but also inspire us to do better.
I usually prefer movies that portray America and the military in a better light (because mostly they deserve it) but occasionally a movie like this one is necessary to help us see the darker side of things.",1036281600,,944,4.371428571428571
1291969,5,B00003CXPO,"In recent years I have shyed away from black enterainment because of inferences of racism seemed to become an excuse which is not needed in today's world.
  Why watch this movie, though one of the cental themes deals with racism and prejudice? It is the strength of the character having enough ambition and character, not to let this get in his way.  The character so demonstrates the quatities needed for sucess.  Also noted, is the characters honesty while in the midst of prejudice to take a look at himself and work toward improvement so that he may become a diver. If we take a look at ourselves we would have probibly hung up the towel along some point and not make the ultiment sacrifice of a leg and possibly our family at achieving the goal of master diver.
  Great acting, character interrelationships, production and scoring combine to make the movie a must see and must purchase.  Recogmended for all.",1036281600,,913,4.70440251572327
1291970,4,B00003CXPO,"This was a fascinating portrayal of a good man's unbelievable willpower, and a flawed man's battle with himself, his limitations, and his honor.  One of the best things about the movie was watching the character `Master Chief Billy Sunday' (De Niro) grow as a person.  I really enjoyed the scene where `Master Chief Billy Sunday' made the determination not to contribute to a man's death just to preserve the navy's status quo...or his own.  The best scene in the movie was when `Brashear' (Gooding, Jr) finally completed his assembly.  This is a movie everyone needs to see because it portrays a man who absolutely ""ain't got no quit in him"" in a period when society expected nothing more then his giving up and giving in.  It also portrays a realistic struggle of a man that has to overcome not only his own prejudices, but must battle personal demons.  The irony is that he succeeds in conquering both, due in large part to his unconventional relationship with a man that that he never even considered being friends with.  I didn't miss the underlying message that today's military leaders have a lot of paper knowledge, yet when it comes to respecting their traditions, they are apathetic.  And when it comes to real war-they don't know their carcasses from a hole in the ground.",1029110400,,1283,4.773755656108597
1291971,5,B00003CXPO,"The title Men of Honor was chosen perfectly for this movie, for the acting by Robert De Niro and Cuba Gooding Jr. was certainly honorable. In the time of racial discrimination between black and white, Carl (Cuba Gooding Jr.) has something to prove. He wants to become a Master Diver, something only white people had been able to do. Through all the taunting, and all the discrimination, Carl never quits. He works hard, and works to be the best. Everyone tries to make him quit, but Carl is not a quitter. Robert De Niro is the diving coach, basically, and he tries to send Carl home. But he learns a lesson or two, as many audience members will probably learn. It isn't the color of someone's skin that makes them special, but their talents and who they are inside. Men of Honor was a powerful movie, with excellent acting and directing. I give it five stars, and would give it more if it was possible. This movie is not for little children to see, but teens, preteens even, and adults will surely find this movie enjoyable, and worth their time.",1026604800,3,1047,4.515789473684211
1291972,4,B00003CXPO,"Men of Honor is a drama about the first African-American and first amputee to become a master diver in the United States Navy and the obstacles he had to overcome to get there.  Cuba Gooding Jr. plays a young black man with a ironclad self-discipline and a mountain of self-respect who comes from a dirt-poor farm in the south.  He has a great desire to succeed and prove himself and not follow in his father's footsteps as a farmer, so he joins the Navy.  Robert De Niro plays the role of the man who trains him.  He is a Navy lifer, an old, hostile, alcoholic misfit who can't do anything else.  His only self-esteem comes from being a Navy master diver.
Set during the time period of the late 1950's through the 1960's, the movie was inspired by the true-life story of Carl Brashear.  The story, acting and cinematography are excellent, with just enough action and suspense to add up to excellent entertainment value.  Hal Holbrook plays an extremely racist senior officer.  Charlize Theron (The Legend of Bagger Vance) plays De Niro's wife.  Aunjamue Ellis plays Carl's wife, Jo, a medical doctor.  The only flaw I can see in the film is that De Niro acts out such a demonstrative, volatile, and angry character that it takes all the attention away from the cool, calm, self-controlled character played by Cuba Gooding Jr.",1026604800,,1326,4.676724137931035
1291973,2,B00003CXPO,"This movie tried too hard to be inspirational.  I like a movie where the inspiration creeps up on you, instead of getting shoved in your face.
At times it was slower than slow, and I just wished they'd get on with the movie.  I'm not too big a fan of Cuba Gooding Jr., and although his acting was okay, he didn't help make the movie any better for me.",1025654400,,351,4.072463768115942
1291974,5,B00003CXPO,"I was really impressed by this full-frame edition. This story takes place at a transitional time in history when men, real men, were measured by their mettle not their color. At least that was the way it was supposed to be. I really like this film. It's not flashy and has a good old-fashioned look and feel about it. Cuba Gooding Jr. enters the Navy with all good intentions but the lingering effects of a segregated military, even though recently abolished, weigh heavy on him. Military traditions good or bad are hard to break.  Robert De Niro plays a Southern bigoted washed up Master Chief in charge of training at the U.S. Navy's diving school. Ordered by commanding officer Hal Holbrook to fail Gooding, De Niro begins to learn the real meaning of honor as shown by Gooding's determination and perseverance at insurmountable odds. Perhaps Gooding's conduct possibly rekindled in De Niro the recognition of those qualities that defined and are the very essence of honor in De Niro's burdened psyche. This film has much more to say than what seems apparent, but the images will linger with you.",1023148800,2,1099,4.814814814814815
1291975,4,B00003CXPO,"I am a complete sucker for military movies. I'm sure this has a lot to do with my upbringing, what with father who's worked in or with the military in one way or another for most of my life. But I think that there is something more fundamental about it to me. The basic precepts appeal to me. Honor, respect, loyalty.
This movie was pretty much what one would expect. Cuba Gooding, Jr. plays Carl Brashear, a young black man who wants nothing more than to be a Navy diver. But, well, he's a young black man. Did I mention that this is in the 40s? Against all odds (a required element in this sort of things), he manages to get to dive school, where he is faced with Billy Sunday (played by Robert DeNiro). Sunday has no interest in passing this upstart young black man, but is slowly won over by Brashear's determination. With the help of Sunday (who was demoted for his trouble), Brashear passes, and begins the slow climb to the rank of Master Diver. As one would expect, Something Major happens, and Our Hero is faced with Mighty Adversity, and his Former Nemesis comes to his aid.
Seriously, though, there are no surprises in this movie. It's all very formulaic. You have all the right elements. The bad guy turned good. The legions of people who learn to overcome their racism, inspired by the young hero. The hero builds up to a pinnacle, then is broken, only to be built up again. The stern, smarmy, unpleasant persons in positions of power. The loving wife.
However, the fact that this movie follows the rote doesn't necessarily make it a bad movie. I think it's a pretty good example of the genre, actually. And it pains me to say this, since I generally don't care for Cuba Gooding, Jr., and he really made the movie. He played his role to a T. Of course, you can't overlook DeNiro. He's getting to be rather good at this sort of role. Maybe it's the gray hair.
All in all, if you're fan of the patently sentimental military movies, this is a good one to watch. If you're not... you probably won't miss anything if you don't see it.",1022371200,,2042,4.404761904761905

After all, If you will it - it is no dream. This is a story about shaping your destiny against all odds.
An excellent movie to show the kids, as movies with character are out of fashion these days and movies with a lot of special FX and sound effects but lacking substance are sadly the in thing. This movie proves that you do not need a big budget to make a great movie.",1022284800,,631,4.056

1292098,2,B00003CXPO,"Men of Honor is a biographical movie about Carl Brashear, who was the first Afro-American Navy diver in history. What could have been an inspiring film about one man's overcoming of some very big obstacles turns out instead to be a standard and predictable military flick. It is entertaining enough, but its subject matter deserved more creative effort.
Brashear [Cuba Gooding, Jr., grew up during World War II on a tenant farm in Kentucky. His father's dream was that Carl would turn out to be somebody, that he would leave the farm and never come back. Carl joined the Navy in the early 50s. Our armed forces had been desegregated by President Truman in 1948, but Carl soon finds out that the Navy has paid only lip service to this change. About the only jobs available to blacks are those of cooks or drivers. After persisting for several years, Carl finally gets admitted to the Navy diving school. At first, Billy Sunday [Robert De Niro}, the head instructor, won't let Carl onto the base. Then his fellow students, all of them white, refuse to bunk with him. After that, it only gets worse. Carl must prove himself over and over again. But as I said, Carl is a very persistent fellow who would rather die than disappoint his father.
As far as I know, the movie faithfully follows Brashear's career path, but I suspect great liberties have been taken with the characters he met along the way. Billy Sunday is portrayed as a foul-mouth, bigoted redneck, who will do anything he can think of, of as well as anything he is ordered to do, to prevent Carl from succeeding. Then, in typical Hollywood fashion, Sunday turns out to be a good guy underneath it all. I know what the movie is trying to say. People change. Still, Sunday's early behavior goes way beyond macho spirit breaking. It is mean and vindictive, and one wonders how Carl can speak to the man later, much less let him help him.
Gooding and De Niro, professionals that they are, do excellent jobs with characters that are basically one-dimensional. Charlize Theron, who is quietly building a formidable reputation as a character actress, is striking as Gwen Sunday, a very interesting character who I wish had been on screen more often. An even more intriguing character is Carl's father, marvelously played by Carl Lumbly, but we see him for less than five minutes. If script writer Scott Marshall Smith had worked harder on making the main characters as interesting, Men of Honor would have been a much better movie.",1016236800,,2484,4.725806451612903

George Tillman in only his second major feature (after SOUL FOOD), has made a quantum leap as a filmmaker. Perhaps because he didn't write this one, MEN OF HONOR has a depth and texture missing in SOUL FOOD.
Cuba Gooding, Jr. does some of his best work to date as Brashear. It is a role well-suited for him. His career would be better served by playing more roles like this one, instead of the silly comedies he's most often cast in.

Men of Honor was both of these.  I give an A+ for the story itself, but there were problems with the technical side of the movie.
First, the acting.  I have never really thought Cuba Gooding Jr. was that great of an actor.  And this movie hammers that thought into my head even deeper.  His facial expressions and the such are OK, but sometimes his words just don't sound right.  He was the only actor in the movie that I had a problem with though.
The directing was good, except it just seems the movie jumped around a lot.  It moved too fast at times.  But really that wasn't too much of a hindrance to the overall movie.

1292162,3,B00003CXPO,"An interesting story that needed to be told (Brashear being the first black Navy diver, and all of the obstacles he had to overcome to get there), but the film suffers from a shifting focus (sometimes DeNiro is a bit much), and needs some tightening.  According to the director, it was over 3 hours to begin with, and at 128 minutes, is still too long.  More focus on Brashear, and less on the fictional character Sunday, would have helped.
I also caught one mistake in the courtroom scene--one does not salute indoors with a hat off (at least not in the Navy).  Snapping to ""Attention!"" would have been appropriate.
In all, a tighter edit, and a more focused script would have helped.  Despite this, Gooding gives a great performance, and so does DeNiro, when he is reined in.",999475200,,777,4.608695652173913

This movie is for those who need not think during a movie. My wife and I, while watching the movie, were making fun of it by saying, ""One man..."" and ""Defies a system"" in our sarcastic ""trailor guy"" voice and unbeknownest to us, they had the trailors on the dvd and the ""trailor guy"" actually said those words! A very boring and predictable movie. At one point, you think the movie is actually over and as I joked to my wife by saying, ""three hours later,"" the movie actually went on for another hour. Another scene: While unrealistically cuba has to prove he can still be ""a navy diveman"" in a courtroom by wearing all of his gear and taking 12 steps in that gear or something like that, he is coached by Deniro each step by saying stuff like, ""ONE!"" ""That's because you're a navy diveman and that's what they do!"" ""Two!"" ""Only a navy diveman can... blah blah blah!"" and so on for each step Cuba takes while overly-dramatic music plays in the background. Yes, I know this movie was based on a true story, but the taking of artistic licsence went way too far for this movie. I think the real story would have been better by them filming the real guy talking about his story. Cuba Gooding, Jr. is typecast and this is the worst for him yet.

The film is too long and sometimes loses focus of who it's honouring, but remains extremely enjoyable and well-written diving flick. I thought the performances were absolutely amazing. Robert DeNiro is an absolute stunner, going through his characters stages and emotions like no other actor good, while Cuba Gooding, Jr. succeeds more than anyone else in the movie. His performance is, quite frankly, a masterpiece. He is this navy man. I believed his determination and no-one could've done better. Hats off to the actors! There were some very enthralling sequences like when Gooding, Jr's character stays underwater for 9 hours, 13 minutes just to become a diver and when he tries to beat DeNiro's character in a breath-holding competition.

As much as it is an unbelievable accomplishment for Mr. Brashear to have overcome extreme obstacles (starting with racism and leading to amputation of his leg), the disappointment lies once again in Hollywood's need to sensationalize rather than tell it like it is.
If I wanted a inspirational movie based on fiction, I would have rented the Karate Kid I through IV (wax on, wax off Danielson),The Best of the Best (Do it!!), Over the Top (Lincoln Hawk) or not to forget Cole Trickle's inspiring portrayal in Days of Thunder (oops I meant Tom Cruise as Cole Trickle).

I do respect Carl Brashear for what he did (even if the movie may have exaggerated it, I don know if it did or not) by watching this film.

1292317,2,B00003CXPO,"This movie looked really good to me because I like those dramatic military films that focus more on a good message or pride instead of documenting how bloody the battle was. And it has De Niro and Gooding Jr. in it who I like. Unfortunately this movie lacked that great climactic achievement and genuineness for me that makes movies special. In this movie, Gooding's upbringing and ideals make every obstacle (like dealing with his pressures to pass a test) hugely dramatic and important.. Which no doubt they were, but mainly only to him in his own mind. They weren't the kinds of scenes that make a movie a ""moving"" motion picture to me. Like many movies, it started well and sort of fell apart at the end trying to chase down all the loose ends and then complicating it by making new ones.
And I really lost it for this movie towards the end when the ""new blood"" Navy leaders began setting ridiculous rules that just made it seem fake. I mean, in my mind if the honor is so secure, how do leading Navy officials who are evil get in (or keep ones who are crazy and who sit in their rooms all day)? Just silly after awhile... (""I wrote the new rule book.."" as De Niro sits down.. stupid) In the end of this movie, it was Gooding's character who maintained honor while the Navy didn't, and I'm sure the Navy's courts never lost honor in real life. The final climactic scene? Gooding walks 12 steps in a 300lb. suit to get Master Diver status as De Niro yells at his face in a Navy courtroom while a nerdy Navy judge changes rules as they go, trying to fail Gooding from getting Master Diver title.. meanwhile there's De Niro's wife who has nothing to do with anything adding drama, sitting next to Gooding's wife and kids, acting as cheerleaders... In a Navy courtroom? It's pretty nuts, and lost credibility with me.

1292404,4,B00003CXPO,"This is a wonderful, heartwarming film, as well as an indictment of the US Navy at a certain time in history. The story is a cinematic, biographical sketch of Carl Brashear, the first African-American to become a diver for the US Navy. Cuba Gooding, Jr. and Robert De Niro both give Oscar calibre performances in this gripping film.
The movie tells the story of Carl Brashear, whose parents instilled in him a determination that would cause him never to give up his dream of becoming a diver in the US Navy. He stuck to his guns, despite the overt racism that he encountered when he joined the Navy. The racism that he encountered would make it harder for him to achieve his life long dream.
Once he became a diver, Mr. Brashear upped the ante and strove to become a master diver. He struggled to do this against all odds, and just when he was on the cusp of achieving his goal, a tragic accident befell him, derailing him temporarily from the path to his ultimate goal. What he then does to fulfill his dream is radical, yet inpirational.
Cuba Gooding, Jr. gives a perfomance so moving and heroic, that the viewer feels like giving him a twenty one gun salute at the end of the film. Robert De Niro plays a racist master diver who is ultimately converted to the side of the angels, when he realizes that Carl Brashear is truly the best of the best. His performance is stellar.
The only problem with the movie is that most of the supporting roles pale in comparison to the two central ones played by Gooding and De Niro. Charlize Theron's role, that of De Niro's wife, is really superfluous to the story. Aunjanue Ellis, who affectingly plays Gooding's wife, has a more crucial, pivotal role than Ms. Theron, but remains a shadowy figure in the backround. Hal Holbrook's portrayal of a loony, racist Navy commander is rather one dimensional, more of a caricature than a character. Notwithstanding these small shortcomings, this is a riveting film that should not be missed.",990835200,22,1973,4.6239316239316235
1292405,2,B00003CXPO,"Nobody in his right mind would disagree with the noble sentiments that inform ""Men of Honor.""  Celebrating the virtues of courage, heroism and strength of character, as well as the triumph of the underdog over personal adversity and societal racism - who could argue against such inspiring themes and concepts?  As such, ""Men of Honor"" has the built-in potential to be a ""feel good"" triumph.  Unfortunately, the narrative arc that the film travels is so tediously predictable and familiar and the sentiment so heavy-handed and treacly that, much as we may want to like the movie, we find ourselves quickly annoyed and bored by it.
This is no reflection on Cuba Gooding Jr. and Robert De Niro, who do their best in two-dimensional, stereotypical roles.  But it IS a reflection on the screenplay by Scott Michael Smith, which, although it is based on the true story of one Carl Brashear, the first African American US Navy diver, nevertheless, plays like a hundred other films with similar scenarios.  ""Men of Honor"" just always ""feels"" like a MOVIE because we already know where it is going long before it gets there. So, essentially, we spend most of the time looking at our watches in the hopes that it will not take too long in completing its mission.
The sappy concluding courtroom scene, in particular, has the word HOLLYWOOD stamped all over it - not helped one whit by the saccharine musical score that seems to ooze across the soundtrack from one end of the movie to the other.
The movie does deal in a surprisingly frank way with the blatant racism that pervaded the military in the years immediately following Truman's forced integration of the forces.  But don't we just know that, despite all the hostility he faces, Brashear will prove himself to be the most courageous, most noble and most technically skilled diver around - easily showing up all the Doubting Thomases in the process, including the by-now-inevitable stock military villain who seems to have devoted his career to standing in the way of this one man's success and progress?  Brashear also turns out to be the most generous of spirit among the men in that he easily forgives the trespasses of those who trespass against him.  What can we in the audience do but wile away the time till all this happens?
At first blush, De Niro's Leslie ""Billy"" Sunday, may seem to be a more complex character.  After all, he defies the military rules so much that even the Navy is forced to demote him to the position of training officer.  Yet, in a way, this is just the typical De Niro role - heavy on bluster, sarcasm and macho posturing, all merely hiding the sweet humanitarian and egalitarian lurking right below the brash surface.
Even the underwater diving sequences, which turn out to be the primary reason for watching the film, seem strangely unimpressive.  I guess that a man standing almost perfectly still, encumbered by an awkward, heavy diving outfit, doesn't make for particularly exciting action cinema.
It's also interesting that the film paints the Navy as consisting almost exclusively of unenlightened racists - then turns around and expects us to get all dewy-eyed and goosepimply when Brashear makes an impassioned speech defending it.
""Men of Honor"" may be a wonderful film for adolescents to see, for those too young to understand fully just how pervasive racism was in our institutions a mere 40 or 50 years ago.  But for those of us who like our dramas a bit less tidy and a trifle more complex in nature, ""Men of Honor"" doesn't provide us with much to occupy our minds with for the duration of its running time - and precious little to think about after the movie is over.",990835200,7,3662,4.776898734177215

He is the only reason to even consider viewing this film and the only reason it got more than 1 star.
Most of the other characters were invented to appeal to the masses or movie execs and believe me, it doesn't work.  Hal Holbrook's cartoonish diving school commander is so contrived, its pitiful.  Oh, I see, he's supposed to be EVIL...they should have had him wear a t-shirt that said ""BAD GUY"" on it so we wouldn't have laughed so hard.  DeNiro's attempt at portraying a bigoted, drunk, brawlin, good ol boy that finally sees the light, seemed about as genuine as the likelihood of this guy having a relationship with someone who looks like Charlize Theron.  Just not buying it.

The other main character in the film is Billy Sunday, a fictionalized hodgepodge of several characters, played by Robert DeNiro. Sunday serves as a parallel and foil to Brashear and as always DeNiro comes through with an authoritive and demanding prescence.
I will not go into detail about the movie's plot. However, a lot of negative criticism has revolved around the movie's formula plot: person with uncredible odds stacked against them overcomes those remarkable odds to become a hero even if only for a few shining moments. True, the movie does follow the formula pretty much by the book, but why should that matter. We live in a society that is ripping apart at the seams. Morality has been replaced by relativity. The prejudices and racial tensions that were so prevalent when Brashear first began his career still exist today. Any life worth living is one full of struggle.

I  found the saga of Carl Brashear, son of a Black sharecropper and a school dropout (in the 7th grade) to be a compelling story indeed. If it wasn't basically true, I honestly wouldn't have believed it. Yes, there were some liberties taken with the truth to jazz this up for Hollywood, but not as much as you'd expect.

1292543,5,B00003CXPO,"It would not be wide of the mark, I don't think, to think of Mr. Carl Brashear as the Jackie Robinson of Navy diving.  This movie is the true story of Brashear and his determination to fulfill his dream of becoming a Navy diver, despite all of the artifical and medical obstacles which lay in his way.
During the epoch covered in this film, African Americans were restricted by the Navy to only being either cooks or Boatswains Mates.  Being a former Boatswains Mate myself, I can attest to just how unglamourous a position it is;  kind of like the Navy's counterpart to Infranty in the Army.
Brashear was one of the first, if not the very first black sailors to break this pattern.  As the first African American to be admitted to Navy diving school, Brashear was forced to endure a degree of the unwarranted prejudice, animosity and hatred that nobody should have to put up with.
Some of the other reviews have accused this movie of being cliche and commonplace.  I could not disagree more.  Have there been other recent movies that have depicted the trials & tribulations of this volatile time in American history?  Most assuredly there have.  Does that make this movie superfluous or unnecessary?  Of course not.  This is a very important movie that deals with part of who we are as Americans, as well as who we want to become.
Unlike many nations which have had difficulty with racial realtions, I believe that we (in the USA) have come a long way.  The racial milieu we have created is far from perfect, particularly in the military.  My time in the Navy can bear witness to that.  However, thanks to pioneers such as Carl Brashear, we all live in a more tolerant, accepting and understanding nation than what it was a mere 40 years ago.  The acrimonious relations have not subsided, but have at least not maintained being the ""norm"" of Navy life.  Were it not for people like Brashear, it is not absurd to think that nothing would have changed at all.

1292544,4,B00003CXPO,"Starring Cuba Gooding, Jr. as Carl Brashear, the first African American Navy diver and Robert DeNiro, as Master Chief Bill Sunday, the redneck instructor who teaches him to dive, this true story makes quite a inspirational film.  Brashear joined the Navy in 1952, the son of a Kentucky sharecropper.  The Navy had just been integrated, but that didn't mean that he would be accepted by the men.  In those days, a black man in the Navy became either a cook or an officer's valet.  But Brashear was determined to be a diver.
There's tension throughout as he has to overcome one obstacle after another. And a great scene when he is taking his final diving test and has to assemble the pieces of a pump while underwater and his test is rigged to make it almost impossible to pass.  I felt I was right down there with him as he struggled in cold water hour after hour.  This is not a story about big battle scenes.  Rather, it is about relations between people.  DeNiro is at first as cruel as the other men, but as he comes to appreciate the determination and love of diving that Brashear has, we see his character change.  It's an excellent theme.
But yet, the film itself somehow missed being great.  I blame it on the screenplay itself.  It's too maudlin, too oversimplified, too much like a soap opera.  The actors did a fine job.  But the material they had too work with could have been a lot better.  I do recommend this video, especially for young people.  It will inspire you and make you realize that not all heroes are playing big time sports.  Some of them are in our own armed forces, determined to do their jobs, and do them well.",988243200,,1639,4.449664429530201

1292546,4,B00003CXPO,I had semi low expectations for this movie but in the end the movie turned out to be great.  Robert D proves again why he is one of the greatest actors of all time.  This was a true story as well which makes it a even better watch.,987984000,,231,3.7916666666666665
1292547,4,B00003CXPO,"Military training films are becoming so common that they are becoming a genre unto themselves.  Among the more prominent we have, ""Officer and a Gentleman"", ""Top Gun"", ""GI Jane"", and now ""Men of Honor"".  The fact that this one happened to be true doesn't change the fact that the formula is the same.  This film is probably most like ""GI Jane"" since it focuses on the desegregation angle.
The story is actually quite inspirational and is probably the best human-interest story among those mentioned above.  Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) is unquestionably a man of great courage and principle, and his strength of character shines through brightly in this film.  Unfortunately, director George Tillman, Jr. has tunnel vision in presenting the characters and eschews character development of various characters other than Brashear in favor of showing Brashear in a constant state of adversity.  Billy Sunday (Robert De Niro) is a central figure, and except for the initial scene, the fistfight and a couple of scenes with his wife, we don't know much about him.  For instance, Brashear sees the scars on Sunday's palms and we are to assume that he worked a plow, but there is no follow-up on that point.  Mr. Pappy (Hal Holbrook) gets only one short scene by which we can judge him.  The rest of his screen time shows him pacing around and ranting.  If a director is going to make a human-interest story, he needs to humanize the characters.
Cuba Gooding Jr. gives an outstanding performance as Brashear.  This is probably the best I've seen him.  This is a role and a character that is far more complete than any part he has played before, and he rises to the occasion.  In ""Jerry Maguire"", Rod Tidwell was a fascinating, but one-dimensional character with the depth of a rain puddle.  Brashear is much more complex and grounded, and the issues he faces are life crises, making the part far more challenging.  This is an excellent recovery from Gooding's last role in ""Chill Factor"", a film so dreadful that it was almost an act of professional suicide to take the part.
After a stint trying his hand as a comedian (""Analyze This"", ""The Adventures of Rocky & Bullwinkle"", ""Meet The Parents""), Robert DeNiro is back to his dramatic roots with an outstanding performance.  DeNiro isn't a bad comedian, he is just such a great dramatic actor that it seems like he shouldn't waste his time doing comedy.  DeNiro endows Billy Sunday with a rock hard personality belying a tortured soul.  It is a pleasure watching him work.
It seems every film I watch lately has Charlize Theron in it.  I saw ""The Legend of Bagger Vance"", ""Men of Honor"" and ""The Yards"" right in a row and I was beginning to wonder if she had a part in every film in 2000 (actually, she only did five).  This was a minor role for Theron, but she carried it off well and managed to stay with DeNiro step for step.  David Keith, who co-starred with Richard Gere in ""Officer and a Gentleman"", has a cameo here
The DVD has some interesting special features, including reflections by the real Carl Brashear and some deleted scenes.
I enjoyed this film despite the hackneyed plot and the one-dimensional presentation.  I rated it a 7/10.  I'm a sucker for underdog stories and I have a fondness for stories where strength of character is the central theme.  This film is particularly strong in both areas and brings us two memorable acting performances that compensate for some of the director's shortcomings.",987811200,24,3468,4.7705192629815745

1292637,1,B00003CXPO,"I was just as eager to see this movie as most people: An epic film starring Cuba Gooding, Jr., Robert DeNiro, and Charlize Theron...Where could it go wrong? But believe me, it did: Horribly, Horribly Wrong. The performances reduced the characters to caricatures: The strong black man who succeeds in the face of adversity, the ""mean old"" racist drill sargeant with the southern accent, the drunken Southern belle with a heart of gold. Besides that, the situations were reduced to cliches. I know that Carl Brashear was a real person who was highly celebrated. I would never judge him as a human being, but a man who won so much acclaim must have had a life and a story much more interesting and nuanced than this movie reveals. What's more, I believe this movie makes him appear extremely unlikable. I am not sure whether the fault lies with the poor script or the performance, but the protagonist in this film seemed far too stubborn for his own good. ...  The reason this doesn't work however is that in a story of triumph such as this, you want your character to succeed against real threats of racism from real characters, not from a caricature. Once again, such a caricature would be fine in an old war movie, but not today. I found this movie to be insulting to the viewers, encouraging them to cheer for behavior that I find to be reprehensible.",987638400,8,1352,4.609958506224066

Maybe it is a worthy subject, being based on a true story, but that isn't enough to make a good film. Quite what De Niro is doing in this kind of trash is beyond me. If he keeps making these terrible films he's going to do his deservedly great reputation a lot of damage.

Arriving at the diving school, Carl, under the watchful eye of ruthless, and harsh training officer Sunday (Robert Deniro), will be the first African American diver in the Navy.  Despite, prejudice, and a severe accident, Carl will battle the odds to achieve his dream...becoming a U.S. Master Diver.

Robert Deniro, and Cuba Gooding Jr. deliver powerhouse performances and the supporting cast of Charlize Theron, Michael Rappaport, and Aunjanue Ellis round things out in this epic story of struggle, determination, friendship, and courage.

1292742,5,B00003CXPO,"After of viewing George Tillman's Men of Honor I felt very inspired. Cuba Gooding Jr. played Carl an African American in the US Navy and worked his way from a low ranked stuart class also known as slave all the way up to an elite Master Diver. Robert De Niro was ""red-neck"" Master Chief Petty Officer Billy Sunday, and ex-diver with an attitude, that put Gooding Jr. through hell. De Niro played that southern extremely well and is able to make the movie watcher despise him. I think that De Niro and Gooding both worked mutually great and could of made any movie into a instant hit, but this one was special because it was a true story, not to mention a pretty damn commendable. I watched it numerous times and recommend it to every one of all ages.",987033600,,750,4.402877697841727
1292743,3,B00003CXPO,"Men of Honor struck me as the formulaic nobody-becomes-somebody type, and it was basically just that.  Carl Rashear (Cuba Gooding Jr.) becomes dedicated to success upon his father's request, and finds his heart go into diving.  Lo and behold, his main objective is to become Master Chief Diver in the Navy.  Surpassing racial discrimination and constant abuse, Rashear eventually succeeds, somewhat.
Men of Honor is a decent movie which people can get into.  While somewhat long, Cuba and De Niro manage to keep the movie at a reasonable pace.  Cheesy romances, unbearably predictable scenes, and other elements in the plot strike Men of Honor in the heart.  Nonetheless, the ending brought me an ounce of inspiration and respect for the real Rashear.  While I'm sure his story was incredibly Hollywood-ized (if it wasn't, he must have some terrible luck), it takes a ton of courage to do something like that.
An honorable try either way.  As far as the DVD version, its a standard extras package with no extra footage in the normal playing movie.  Fairly decent.",987033600,2,1063,4.96045197740113

A cliche ridden, unintentionally comic, and hackneyed piece of work. The film is also an insult to the real Carl Brashear. A great story has been turned into a piece of overblown hollywood pap. The only redeeming feature is Cuba Gooding Jnrs performance. As a long standing admirer of Robert DeNiro I can only say this is arguably his worst performance--he even uses his CAPE FEAR accent. The film is filled with stock (and underdeveloped) characters and situations. This film is mainstream filmmaking at its most lamentable. It's as if film narrative has stood still for 35 years.

1292747,4,B00003CXPO,"Carl Brashere's life is chronicled in this ""against all odds"" movie that highlights his resilience vs. the ""old navy"". The opening scenes display the hard, farm life Brashere (Cuba Gooding Jr.) was born into, conveying the ""back breaking"" fortitude his father displays, in order to keep the family farm. When Brashere originally enlists, he notifies the family of his chosen career, the elder Brashere,(Carl Lumby) sternly warns his son of returning home - intensifying the young Brashere's intention to buck the system and prevail at all costs...  Early on, in his tour of duty, Brashere is relegated to cook's detail, the obvious choice for young enlisted african-american naval men. Undaunted, Brashere vows to become an elite member of the Naval Diving Core. Initially, he is laughed at by his fellow naval men.  After dilligent pursuit in seeking admission into the Naval Diving School he is finally accepted upon sending countless letters.  Master Seargant Billy Sunday (Robert DeNiro) is the self-proclaimed god of the training school,where he puts trainees thru pure-hell in order to qualify as a deep sea diver. The DeNiro character is a hard-charging, whiskey drinking southerner who has trouble following orders - and he's prone to violence if provoked.  Brashere confronts racism immediately once arriving on the base. His bunk-mates refuse to share the dorm - walking out one by one. His only friend is the Michael Rappaport character, who just seems to be an outcast, but provides support for Brashere.  The real conflict is between Brashere and Sunday, who quietly have a mutual admiration for each other, sighting their similar backgrounds. Brashere breezes thru the training, until the last obstacle. Pappy, the brash General who's aloofness is apparent when hunkering over the men in an oversized tower. Pappy (Hal Holbrook) is totally against Brashere graduating, and directs Sunday to halt his progress by all means. Without divulging an enormous amount of information Brashere remains the victor.
  During this period, Brashere's career is on the upswing and Sunday's is in a downward spiral. Sunday's hostility and drunkeness escalates during a party where he assaults a Naval officer. I love DeNiro's southern accent - it's almost similar to the Max Cady character in ""Cape Fear"" minus the decadence.  Brashere's dedication and fearlessness is further tested when he is injured during a dive. He is forced to go against the grain again during a lengthy trial. Requesting re-admission into the Navy, versus the serious injury, Brashere's back is against the wall once again . Who's there to help him? None other than the raucous Sunday, who appears out of nowhere, to assist Brashere. Of course, we know the final outcome, but who cares!!! It's a feelgood movie..Director Tillman, seems adept at making these types of movies..ie: Soul Food..Plus it's a true story, making it more conceivable. Only drawback, in my estimation, are the scenes between Carl Brashere and his wife, which seem misplaced and not in tune with the picture.

Not only was the acting great but the special effects were way above par also.  I won't go into great deatil because I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it, but there are some parts in this movie so intense, I caught myself holding my breath.  Edge of your seat!!  This is a must own.  Don't even bother with the ""Well let's rent it and see if we like it, then maybe we can buy it later.""  Just get it.

1292749,4,B00003CXPO,"Anyone who is uninspired by Brashear's accomplishments against seemingly impossible obstacles has a heart of stone.  The first two-thirds of this film is about as good as straightforward, old-fashioned filmmaking gets.
Cuba Gooding Jr. is growing as an actor.  Unlike his earlier likeably cute but cartoonish work in Jerry Maguire and As Good as it Gets, here he gives an emotionally honest portrayel of a simple but heroic man.  As for Robert DeNiro, chewing his corncob pipe like Patton and barking at his young charges, we've seen him in this type of role before, and with good reason: he is excellent at it.  (But was it just me or did it seem like his country accent waxed and waned in different parts of the film?)
This film is so effective for the first two-thirds or so that it is disappointing to see how it unravels at the end.  After having reached an exhilerating climax with Brashear passing his diving test, the film seems to drift, as the audience has no way to know that a second storyline is being set up.  That storyline also is inspiring but is handled much less skillfully than the first storyline.  All manner of Hollywood cliches pop up, including a stock villain who tries to end Brashear's career and a hokey courtroom ending.  Another problem is that Men of Honor telegraphs its ending.  With all that we've seen Brashear overcome without a single failure along the way, the ""suspenseful"" courtroom ending (Can he pass the physical test or not?) is about as unpredictable as whether the sun will rise tomorrow.
Despite some reservations, I recommend seeing Men of Honor.  It's a great and uplifting story, and when this movie is good, it's really good.  If the DVD includes information about the real Brashear, that would be a delight.  I would like to know the real story behind this remarkable man.",981936000,4,1825,4.758730158730159
