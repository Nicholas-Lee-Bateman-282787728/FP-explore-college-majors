3527932,3,B001DAVTQK,"Freedom's Fury is a documentary on the events surrounding the Hungarian Uprising of 1956 and the famous 'Blood in the water' match that followed it.  It's a solid, journeyman work but lacks the emotional connection and human drama that separates good documentaries from great ones.

Much of the documentary shows newsreel of the events leading up to and during the Hungarian uprising of 1956.  For someone unfamiliar with those events, this part is informative but I believe takes the focus off the individuals involved in the story.  There is a good interview with Kati Marton about her families escape but the film needs more of these individual stories and less of newsreel footage. This would have given the viewer a greater emotional connection to the people involved and really bring out what it was like to be there.

As for the famous match, I was surprised at how little of it was shown in the film.  I would have like to know more about how the participants felt during the match, both Hungarian and Russian.  I felt the filmmakers should have developed the characters a little more, again to help the viewer connect with them.  There was some of that but not enough.",1264464000,3,1177,4.763546798029557
3527933,5,B001DAVTQK,"I was in Budapest, aged 16 during the events that form the core of this amazing production.
Using contemporary actualities, interviews and a very entertaining introduction into the mysteries of
water-polo, the final message of reconciliation through sport is a moving and powerful testimony
to the Hungarian nation and its struggle to keep its head above the water in the XXth century.
It is an unsentimental portrayal of  heroism and moral fibre.",1395014400,,447,5.208333333333333
3527934,5,B001DAVTQK,"The video presentation is well put together. For me longer sequences of contemporary scenes of the fighting in Budapest would have been preferrable, i.e. less jumping about and more meaningful periods given to each scene. The story is involved, and difficult to explain to the uninitiated, but the film team, director, etc. did a good job overall. Thankfully, there was no attempt to reduce the scale of horror the Soviet Army and the Communists had perpetrated. It was a fair portrayal. I would thoroughly recommend it.",1385596800,,520,5.058139534883721
3527935,5,B001DAVTQK,"I saw various parts of this documentary on YouTube & I thought that surely this must be available somewhere in it's entirety on a DVD? I took a long shot & sent an email to someone in Hungary whose email address I found on the internet.

I received a reply & the lady explained that they (the Hungarians) saw it at the cinema a few years ago.

I mentioned the DVD to my brother the day it arrived & to my surprise he said that he would like to view that evening. (This was after he asked me the title & had a read about the DVD on the internet).

Whilst it is shocking & tragic & the reason why I was born in Australia & not in Hungary; it is also testimony to the amazing courage of the Hungarian people in the face of the overwhelming might of the USSR, secret police, terror & oppression. One person from the West who was involved in the making of the documentary commented: ""When they fall down, they stand up taller than before.""

The behind the scenes footage & the explanations about the making of the documentary is quite a saga in itself. A huge amount of work & dedication has gone into producing an historical but also an immensely gripping & moving work of art.
It is not all misery but is punctuated with 'wins' in another domain: The 1956 Olympics in Melbourne, Australia.
This is a DVD that you would love to have in your own collection or to give as a gift to someone who has a love of history, human rights, sport or admiration for courage in the face of unbelievable adversity & oppression.",1380499200,,1508,4.2622377622377625
3527936,5,B001DAVTQK,"It was very interesting to meet the real Olympians who were behind the movie, Children of Glory. The young couple who made this documentary went to great lengths to authenticate their material, and their interviews of the former athletes, as well as persons who were involved in the Hungarian Revolution of '56, were very well done. I recommend this documentary to any history buff.",1371772800,,382,4.984375
3527937,5,B001DAVTQK,"Our tour guide through Hungary recommended this film, which I had seen prior to our tour.  It deserves all the awards that it as received -- and more -- providing a revealing look at the 1956 Hungarian revolt against the communist government, and the reasons for rebellion, thorough the perspective of international sports and the individuals on the Hungarian water polo team.",1371081600,,376,5.064516129032258
3527938,4,B001DAVTQK,"This is really a good video.  It covers the basics of the 1956 revolution in Hungary from the point of view of the Olympic Polo Team.  This team beat the Russian team while the revolution was still occuring in Hungary.  If you're interested in learning a bit about what happened in Hungary, this is worth watching!",1355616000,,314,4.571428571428571
3527939,5,B001DAVTQK,"When I was a young teen in Syracuse, NY, our family had a friend who came to Central New York during the Hungarian Revolution. He used to spend time with my parents telling of his coming to the U.S.  I was too young at the time for this to have an impact.  In my adult life here in Bay area I have a business friend who is my contemporary and also came to the U.S. during the Revolution....now I was starting to realize what happened. But...nothing brought it into focus and drove it home like ""Freedom's Fury."" My wife and I see a lot of movies and especially like documentaries. This movie is extraordinary! The editing, sound integration and score are worthy of an Academy Award anytime.  The Sibs, brother and sister, are to be congratulated for this achievement as are all the others who have left us with this record and, in the end, a very heart warming story. Not to be missed!!!!!",1298160000,,889,4.408536585365853
3527940,5,B001DAVTQK,"As a native Hungarian, who was 5 years old at the time, I bought 5 copies of this DVD to give to my children and brother for them to hear the events of 1956. Extremely well told with the background of the amazing sports story.",1297123200,,226,4.044444444444444
3527941,5,B001DAVTQK,"I have seen most of the documentaries made for the 50th anniversary of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution and Freedom Fight. This one stands out high among all. The viewer feels the power of peoples' desire to be free, regardless of specific places in the Earth. Watching the happy faces of the huge masses filling the streets, squares and bridges of Budapest, you can't help it, tears come to your eyes seeing the love for freedom.
The message is universal. This documentary, while it is entertaining, should be shown to young and old over and over again, because the fight for freedom should be a never ending struggle, and if we forget about that, our freedom will be lost or slowly chipped away.",1287792000,7,694,4.69672131147541
3527942,5,B001DAVTQK,"I was very young during the Hungarian Revolution.  My parents had just emigrated to the U.S. in 1951 so this was a very difficult and emotional time for them.  First, there was joy that perhaps they could ""go back home."" Then sadness as the Hungarians were crushed.  I had heard much about the water polo match as well as the revolution but actually seeing the film footage from both - wow!  This is a really good movie - especially for young Hungarian Americans and non-Hungarians to understand what the Hungarians had gone through to try to gain their freedom.  After 50+ years, it finally became a reality.",1284422400,5,609,4.654205607476635
8292518,5,B001DAVTQK,"This is an incredible story.  If you care about water polo or the horrors of the Soviet Union this is important history.  The producers of the film were able to get these men before they aged too far.  It was interesting to me that after time the players were friendly. I had the impression from playing polo int he sixties that the Hungarians would have been killed if they returned, but obviously they were very much alive and many of them did go back after their gold medal.  Heroes!",1512864000,,486,4.426966292134831
8292519,2,B001DAVTQK,"The story is gripping, but the dvd is a bad print that fails back to the menu on three different DVD players right after the game.  We returned it for a replacement, but the second copy was the same.",1495756800,,199,4.102564102564102
8292520,2,B001DAVTQK,"We are not able to play this movie on a Mac computer, a Windows computer, or in a DVD player. It seems to be a format problem that we can't overcome. Useless.",1493769600,,158,3.96875
