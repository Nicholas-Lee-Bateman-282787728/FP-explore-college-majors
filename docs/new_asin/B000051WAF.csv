1387800,2,B000051WAF,"I really hate to say this, but I thought Esther was a huge dissappointment.  We *adore* VeggieTales and we own [and love] all of them.  I was extremely excited about this one with ""Esther"" in particular, because it would have a female lead character.  [I am the mom of a little girl, and that's my only real complaint about VeggieTales - hardly any female main characters.  Laura the Carrot is the only recurring female really, and she gets very little air time compared to the guys.  Since I'm trying to raise a devout Christian woman, I'd like some help with a couple of female role models!].
How sad I was when I bought this one though - the female lead, Esther, is a whiny, pouty, obnoxious little thing [and I can't even identify her as an actual vegetable - she looks more like a green stick to me].  The wonderful VeggieTale format has been altered with this one [no intro with Bob and Larry, no Silly Song, no closing comment from Querty], much to the detriment of this video, in my opinion.  The whole tone of this story is very dark compared to the others, and there are two scenes that include a very scary Grim Reaper who comes out with a feather to take the 'bad guys' to the ""Island of Perpetual Tickling"".  The Grim Reaper scared my two year old to tears, however, and now she screams ""No, I'm scared of the Tickling Guy!"" and cries if we try to watch Esther again.  Not a big plus.
There are some good things about this one however - the animation in particular is spectacular.  Also, Pa Grape makes a great showing as Esther's wise cousin Malachai, Mr. Lundt is a very entertaining villian, and Mr. Nezzer as the King is wonderful as well.
I wouldn't neccessarily reccommend Esther - and definitely I'd get all the other VeggieTales first, but this one is probably worth owning for a die hard Veggie Fan.",975196800,27,1821,4.457831325301205
1387801,5,B000051WAF,"We bought this for our two year old son, since he loves Veggie Tales.  This one though, has become his favorite.  And it has become a favorite in the house, as my husband, my son and I recite lines daily from the video.  Big Idea kept the story of Esther very true to the Bible story, yet made the less than desirable parts of the real story less ""crude"".  For example, instead of banishing Queen Vashti from Persia for not parading in front of King Xerxes noblemen naked wearing only a crown, Veggie Tales has her banished for not making her husband a sandwich in the middle of the night.  The gallows in the real story become ""Death"" with a feather coming to banish people to the ""Island of Perpetual Tickling"" in this Veggie Tales parody.  Very well done, definitely Big Idea's best try at animation. And even if the story doesn't have all the original characters and silliness, it is a story worth hearing, and is very entertaining.",973555200,9,936,4.508875739644971

1387805,4,B000051WAF,"Parents should teach their children how to read the Bible and how to understand the things they watch.  This film is not attempting to teach the Bible or be a parent to your children.  Any expectation that some film can replace you, or the Holy Spirit, is an outright deception.  What else would you have them watch on the weekends?  Would you rather struggle to explain the purpose of a randomly selected Nickelodeon cartoon star, or why the Veggie Tales Esther is more whiny than the actual Esther?  For what it is meant to be, this movie is mostly what it should be.  Nothing, never, no way can ever replace the Bible.  Expecting otherwise is an exercise in vanity and idolatry.",1473033600,,681,4.578512396694215

Everything from the relationship between Esther and her uncle Mordecai to the Peoni Brothers' plot to kill the king, to Mordecai plotting to send the Jews to the Island of Perpetual Tickling, ""where you are tickled day and night, and night and day, no matter how much you ask them to stop, even if you say pretty please""!",1464998400,,442,4.432098765432099

1387810,2,B000051WAF,"Kind of disappointed in the way Veggie Tales retells the biblical story of Esther. In the cartoon, Haman got banished to an island where he'd be punished by being tickled, Esther was entering into a talent show, and a few others. This is why children aren't familiar with biblical truths -- because some want to water down the Scriptures to make it appealing or rated child-approved. We need to tell our children the truth and stop diluting everything.",1463184000,,452,4.8076923076923075

1387826,5,B000051WAF,"This Veggie Tales Episode is one of my favorites. It got me into reading the book of Esther in the bible and become of of my favorite bible stories. She is dentally the kind of princess christian girls should look up too. This ""Veggie Tale""  episode teaches us how to face our fears and speak out for whats right.
This 'Tale'  tells us the story of a beautiful shy girl named Esther had just become Queen of Persia. She also has a fear of speaking out for whats right and question her abilities as a queen. Lucky she has her companion and the king's good guard Mordecai to help her out. Suddenly trouble's aburen when the King's right hand man Haman has a strong hatred towards Mordicai. To get rid of him, Haman tricked the King into getting rid of Mordicai. and his family. Unfortunately, lucky for Mordicai, there is a snag involving his plan. For you see, what Haman(Not even the King) knows that Mordicai happens to be related to Esther! And because Haman doesn't know, he didn't realize that by getting rid of Mordicai and his family, he's getting rid of the queen too. This is a great advantage on Mordicai's part because with Esther as queen, she can tell the King about Haman's plot and save her family. But can she face her fears and speak out before it's too late?

Defiantly a 5 star rating!",1435363200,,1303,4.443514644351464

1387839,5,B000051WAF,"This is a very well done production of an adult-like subject matter.  VeggieTales takes the story of Esther from the Bible and makes is easy for kids to understand.  It tastefully substitutes the more risqu portions of the story with appropriate, but still relevant, parallels that set a course for children to understand the real content when they get older.  The premise remains the same.  No context is lost.  It is simultaneously funny and serious, and respectful.

1387842,5,B000051WAF,Another hit from Veggie Tales.  This is very well put together and I can't think of one thing any parent would find objectionable.  This would be near the top of Veggie Tales if I were rating it.,1368748800,,195,4.243243243243243

1387850,2,B000051WAF,"I have always loved and been inspired by the story of Esther.  But this movie is one of the only Veggietales shows I was not happy with.  The character of Esther was not well done...she is portrayed as a rather spoiled and selfish girl who whines about being picked as queen and is too scared to even tell the truth about her friend stealing.  Big Idea was trying too hard to portray Esther as an ordinary girl, someone we could identify with.  While their intentions were good, the truth is that Esther was not an ordinary girl.  She was courageous and selfless and loyal to her God.  I think this movie would have been a bigger success had Esther been more willing to do her duty...instead of whining and complaining about it first.

Also, as mentioned in previous reviews, the lack of the silly song, introduction letter, and usual veggie humor was quite disappointing.  If you're new to the Veggietales series, I'd suggest any other movie in it, but if you've grown up with the veggies like I have, just be aware ""Esther the Girl Who Became Queen"" doesn't measure up to the other titles in the series.",1307923200,,1105,4.545454545454546
1387851,2,B000051WAF,"It's odd that many of the parents here think this story was bad because it wasn't ""funny"" enough.  Kids like dark shows -- take Harry Potter or Twilight.  Esther is a very dark story, that has a happy ending, but in trying to avoid communicating any of that darkness the writers ended up making a very drab, very boring story.

The moral choice Esther was forced to make was try to save the entire Jewish people and risk dying in the process -- or say nothing and not go through any hardship.  This is after she is kidnapped and forced into marriage.  It's  kind of hard to take any of it seriously when the punishment for appearing to the king is going to the ""Island of Perpetual Tickling"" or the success is saving ""just her family"" from the ""Island of Perpetual Tickling.""  While funny in theory (but not in fact), the story calls for a greater moral stake in order to be interesting.  If the stakes are so low that they are unimportant, nothing can be learned and the suspense is trite.",1291248000,,990,4.4010989010989015

1387859,4,B000051WAF,"Esther, The girl who became queen is a retelling of the story of Esther for children. Like the other veggietales videos it presents difficult biblical topics in a a fun way at a child's level. The story is about a young Hebrew girl who becomes the wife of the King of Persia. Esther is witnessing her people being persecuted.

This veggietales story tells how God has a plan for his people and he will always be their to protect them eventhough they might not see it. This is a very tough concept that is presented to children in a way that they can understand. Many children today are going through difficult times. Many children come from broken homes and since September 11th many children are fearful of terrorist attacks. It is hard to see God's perpose through all these bad things. The story of Esther shows that God does care and he has a plan for everyone.

I was fortunate to able to attend the Intervarsity Urbana Missions Conference in '87 and again in '93. During the 1987 conference one of the main speakers stated that we cannot readily see God's plan for us but he shows us enough to be able to take one step then shows us enough to take another step.

This is the message of Esther, in that God plan for us my not be totally clear but he is there to guide oursteps. This veggietales video shows that God is faithful to those who are obediant to him and he gives his people encouragement to fullfill the plan that he has for each and everyone of us.",1117670400,,1465,4.3786764705882355

1387862,5,B000051WAF,"This DVD is quite a bit different from the other Veggie Tales' DVDs.  First, this is no counter top beginning or ending and no silly song with Larry.  Instead, the entire time is spent on the story of Esther.  That is a good thing since I don't believe that any of this could be cut and still tell the same story.  What sets this movie apart from other veggie tales is the animation.  They have definitely taken their animation to a new level in this movie with fantastic details in many of the scenes.
For humor their is a great song about Lost Puppies and then the references to the Godfather throughout the movie.  Other musical numbers were equally good.
This is definitely one of their better movies.",1072396800,5,705,4.46875
1387863,5,B000051WAF,"Esther represents a slight departure for the VeggieTales crew.  In focusing on the retelling of this story from the Bible, some of the traditional humorous elements from previous videos are gone.  Instead, the video focuses completely on the story of the girl picked to be queen who discovers God has placed her there in order to save her people.  But will she have the courage to follow through?
Big Idea did a good job of packing all the twists and turns of the story from the Bible into 35 minutes while still making it appropriate for kids.  My favorite change was ""The Land of Perpetual Tickling.""  I completely missed the references to ""The Godfather,"" but Ive never seen those movies to begin with.  Still, this explains the reference to ""family"" and not ""the Jews"" in the story line.  While I missed the ""Silly Songs with Larry"" segment, it would have broken the flow and tone of the story, and I'm glad it was left out.  Instead, we have the hilarious ""Lost Puppies"" song from the audition scene.  And Esther gets several great songs.  They might not be the bouncy, upbeat songs we're used to hearing, but they are beautiful songs of God's protection that fit the video well.
This movie was visually the most stunning and complex they had tried to date, and this transfers well to the new DVD release.  As always, the DVD contains a behind the scenes featurette and some Easter eggs that give a better idea of what went into the production of this episode.  There are some fun things for kids to do (even I enjoyed the maze).  But the highlight is the audio commentary with Phil and Mike.  This seems to be one of the better ones.  They talk a lot about the leaps forward they tried with this episode and what they learned from it.  Plus we get to hear why using vegetables is a blessing and a saddlement.
Always searching for ways to expand the series, Big Idea hit the mark with this excellent video.  It's a little different then the others, but if you'll give it a fair chance, you'll see it just might be their best yet.",1061942400,8,2034,4.498637602179836

If you value the fact that people who are not like you have the same rights as you, then this is the way to show your child- without having to say a whole lot.

1387867,5,B000051WAF,"Esther represents a slight departure for the VeggieTales crew.  In focusing on the retelling of this story from the Bible, some of the traditional humorous elements from previous videos are gone.  Instead, the video focuses completely on the story of the girl picked to be queen who discovers God has placed her there in order to save her people.  But will she have the courage to follow through?
Big Idea did a good job of packing all the twists and turns of the story from the Bible into 35 minutes while still making it appropriate for kids.  My favorite change was ""The Land of Perpetual Tickling.""  I completely missed the references to ""The Godfather,"" but as others have mentioned, this explains the reference to ""family"" and not ""the Jews"" in the story line.  While I missed the ""Silly Songs with Larry"" segment, it would have broken the flow and tone of the story, and I'm glad it was left out.  Instead, we have the hilarious ""Lost Puppies"" song from the audition scene.  And Esther gets several great songs.  They might not be the bouncy, upbeat songs we're used to hearing, but they are beautiful songs of God's protection that fit the video well.
Always searching for ways to expand the series, Big Idea hit the mark with this excellent video.  It's a little different then the others, but if you'll give it a fair chance, you'll see it just might be their best yet.",1014854400,2,1379,4.614754098360656
1387868,5,B000051WAF,"This soon-to-be Grammalinda just watched her first VEGGIE TALE, the videos of talking vegetables acting out the premise of biblical tales. Nope, I am NOT kidding. Actually, I was suspecting the very worst - but was pleasantly surprised!  Sure they are simplistic (well, duh!) but still pretty cute.  The computer graphics made this a very visual tale, the armless and legless vegetables were creatively portrayed.  I did find it telling that Queen Esther, the grape Mordecai and their ""family"" were to be banished to the Island of Perpetual Tickling (they couldn't have said The Jews?).  And I was disappointed that Queen Vashti (who is sorta MY hero) was wearing curlers in her cucumber hair during her brief walk on.
Interestingly, as the kitty and I curled up in front of a fire to watch this video, I was joined by my teenage son's girlfriend and finally he joined us too.

1387869,5,B000051WAF,"I understand the concerns of parents of small children, but I'd still recommend it for older children and, of course, for adult fans :)
I have to disagree somewhat with the reviewer who said Esther missed the point. If a church is worth its title, Christians do learn early on that the Jews are physical descendants of Abraham -- a concept easily described to younger viewers as a very extended family. While we don't celebrate Purim, we do study the book of Esther and we know the important points -- namely, the threat of genocide and God's hand in the preservation of His people. Of course, the story changes a few details so kids don't have to hear about death; but the fate the family does face isn't a good one to a child, either.
It's a good translation of Esther into something children can more easily grasp. Of course, just in case a child might miss the point, that's when parents and children can discuss the tape afterwards and the parent can fill in the blanks about who the family really is and anything else the child might ask. It's a good open door for a Christian parent to teach children more about the Jewish roots of Christianity... and a challenge for all Christians to learn more about it themselves.",1008633600,4,1224,4.542986425339366

I have to confess, this is my very favorite of all the Veggie Tales videos I've ever seen.  It was not the huge success that some of the others have been, and I can understand why.  No ""Silly Songs"", no opening segment with Larry and Bob, etc. (Though I loved the opening sequence showing the children of Veggie Tales employees).  Instead, this particular Veggie Tale tells a straigtforward Bible story, one especially loved by Christians and Jews alike, namely, the story of Esther -- the Queen who saved her people.
Like other Veggie Tales, the humor is on two levels.  Kids will enjoy the songs and animation; adults will appreciate the ""godfatheresque"" storytelling, accents, emphasis on ""family"" and the like.
The producers of Veggie Tales took a risk with this one -- and to my mind, succeeded in their purpose.  Let's hope they tackle more full-length Bible stories in the same fashion, while still producing the traditional Veggie Tale adventures we've come to know and love.

Although the story was wonderful, and the animation unbelievably realistic, I feel it lacked the core of what drew me to Veggie Tales. Not only was Ester pretty whiny, but also I felt the Biblical message just wasn't there. Even though it is a Bible story, it seemed to be mostly about Ester finding strength in HERSELF, instead of in God, to do the right thing. I tried to show this to my preschool Sunday school class, and without the Silly Song intermission (when they usually get to get up and dance off some energy), they were bored 2/3 of the way through. It's a great movie for older kids, but just doesn't hold the attention of preschoolers, who don't understand the gangster theme anyway",986860800,,740,4.529850746268656

My children LOVED it... sure it's different than what was done originally, but some kids don't actually get the humor until they are older.  I feel that by judging it by an original format, you aren't giving Big Idea a chance to explore other types of formats.  My children and I are open to anything, as long as the main idea (the approach to teaching about values through the Bible) are still there, which it obviously is.  So don't dismiss this so quickly... put that tape back into the VCR or go buy it, and let your kids enjoy/explore variety... it's not about the feel of it but about what you get out of it - ""God made you special, and He loves you very much.""",985824000,,786,4.25503355704698

I'm sorry if I disagree with all of you, but I think that this is probably one of their finest pieces of animation to date, and my kids love it (they're 6 and 3). Contrary to what everyone seems to be claiming, not all of the Veggie Tales have silly songs segments, and it would be very difficult to make the story of Esther any lighter than this. That being said, this is one of the finest moments in computer animation history, as well as in the history of Veggie Tales. They've tried to do something very different here, and it is this style that will probably inform the announced Veggie Tales movie, since the half-hour format with the Bob and Larry intros would be impossible to sustain for a feature length film. I may be in the minority, but I really like this one.",985305600,18,901,4.244186046511628

1387881,5,B000051WAF,"This is unlike any other Veggie Tale, first of all.  It is a new concept for the show, which is GOOD.  The creators have done a great job adapting the Bible story of Esther into a VeggieTale.  It contains much humour and all the great 'sight gags' that make VeggieTales so much fun for adults, like myself (24 years old!) and yet it is also enjoyable to our one and a half year old little boy.  It is true, that Bob is not in this episode and Larry has only a minor part as the King's (Mr. Nezzer) scribe, but it allows for other characters to shine, such as Mr. Lunt who plays the villain in this episode even better than he has in previous episodes.  I may be biased though, since I am likely Mr. Lunt's biggest fan.  While some of the elements that made past Veggie Tales so exciting are not there, to me that just means that the creators of Veggie Tales are not just one-trick ponies: they can make different content just as well, and it helps avoid falling into a rut with the ""same ol' same ol'"" formula, which plagues many other tv and video programs.  We love ""ESTHER"", and have only had it less than a week but have watched it numerous times already.

1387883,3,B000051WAF,"After eagerly awaiting this new release in the superior VeggieTales series, my family was a bit disappointed.  This episode lacks the silliness that makes the others so enjoyable.  While my two daughters did enjoy watching the video over and over, I don't think it compares to the other VeggieTales.
As a mother of two girls, I appreciate Big Idea's use of a Biblical story with a heroine.  None of the other videos have featured a lead female character.  Esther is indeed a story with rebellion, revenge, and violence.  Big Idea has toned all this down, of course.  Still, it's difficult to find other Biblical tales with women in active, positive roles that don't involve even more violence, vengeance, and worse.  Tamar?  Rebecca making off with her father's household idols?
I agree with the other reviewer that Esther comes off as a bit whiny.  She lacks the vivid characterization at the heart of the appeal of the sorely-missed Bob, Larry, Archibald, et al. In a nutshell:  ""Esther"" is not up to the quality of ""Rack, Shack, and Benny"" or ""Dave and the Giant Pickle.""

I remember thinking ""Man, when is something FUN going to happen??!"" Big Idea does capture the meaning of the Esther story (and, by the way, I kinda figured out that our Veggie-Esther was a wild onion, but it took me a few minutes), but unlike all the other videos, this one just wasn't fun. I'm not sure why this one didn't turn out as well as all the others...perhaps they were just too busy working on ""321 Penguins,"" but I have no idea how much merit that has since I have yet to watch it. Of course, perhaps I'm putting a little too much emphasis on all this, seeing as how I'm a 20 year old college student with no children, but I guess everyone needs a diversion.

1387885,3,B000051WAF,"This Veggie Tale is reputedly about the Biblical story of Esther but the Big Idea Video presentation raises many questions: 1)  Why make a Veggie Tale about a story in the Bible that does not mention God (unless one reads the Apocryphal additions)?  Apparently the Big Idea people realized this problem and added prayers and songs to God (just like the Apocrypha additions to Esther). 2)  Why pick a story like Esther that is about revolt and murder and (violent) revenge?  Other Biblical tales would have yielded better treatments.  If the Big Idea people think that Esther is a neat story perhaps they should do a Veggie Tale on Elisha send a bear to maul (and kill) the young boys who make fun of him.
If Veggie Tales is going to use stories like Esther and add songs about God's protection, perhaps they should use Aesop's fables(like the book of Virtues and the PBS animated series)and add Judeo-Christian themes.
I guess my basic question for the Big Ideas people is why they decided to do Esther at all.  Just because something is in the Bible does not make it edifying.",978048000,5,1077,4.6421052631578945

She is a whiny weakling kind of character with a lack of depth but that is a valid part of the story, she is an ordinary girl who is thrown into extra ordinary circumstances.
