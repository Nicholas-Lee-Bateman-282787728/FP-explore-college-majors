8254738,3,B00149XOU4,"I'm a huge GlobeTrekker fan so I'm very familiar with their productions and style....the first part of this, in Cyprus with KT Comer, is very typical...well produced, upbeat and informative and gives you a pretty good summary of the whole island.  The second part, while Adela Ucar is a good host, she spends nearly all of her time devoted to the German invasion of Crete, talking to veterans and survivors of the experience and she only visits war sites and cities on the eastern third of the island and never goes anywhere else.  For example, she only mentions on of Crete's most major cities and portals, Heraklion, but she doesn't actually go there.  All in all, the but about Cyprus is well done, but Samantha Brown's show on Crete is far better than this one.  Kind of a disappointment for me as I'm love the whole GlobeTrekker series.",1253923200,,841,4.662162162162162
8254739,4,B00149XOU4,"Good Video of Cyprus and Crete. The Crete section was more detailed and showed more of this island, than it did with Cyprus, which was a disapointement. Wanted to see more of Cyprus, with regards to villages and culture.",1251072000,,220,4.666666666666667
