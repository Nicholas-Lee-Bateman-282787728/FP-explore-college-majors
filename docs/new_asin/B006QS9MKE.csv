5013493,5,B006QS9MKE,"About 2/3 of the way thru this documentary, we get the key quote that explains why Roger Corman is so important:  ""It's hard to imagine the new Hollywood without Roger Corman"" - Peter Bogdanovich.  Whether or not you think you've seen a Corman film, odds are good that you have seen one and don't even realize it, and you've certainly seen films that carry the Corman aesthetic, as he's influenced so many cutting-edge filmmakers over the last 50+ years.  It's impossible to imagine late 60's/early-70's films' embrace of counter-culture and non-traditional themes (stuff like ""Easy Rider"", ""Two Lane Blacktop"", ""Mean Streets"", to name a few) without his lead, and his influence continues today in the films of Tarantino and others in the young-director set (Eli Roth and anyone making horror films).

""Corman's World"" is a must-see documentary for anyone who is a serious student of filmmaking and movie history.  Simply put, Corman is a key figure in not only the development of the independent filmmaker, but also because of the sheer number of actors, actresses, directors, producers and technical people whose paths crossed early in their careers with him, and went on to win Oscars and create some of the landmarks of cinema over the last 50+ years.  He was smart enough to not lose money on almost any film he made, smart enough to anticipate the potential of the youth market, but also smart enough to teach up-and-comers and take a chance on unproven talent and let it blossom.

I thought the documentary gave a pretty well-rounded picture of Corman's career, and his philosophy & approach to filmmaking:  the do-it-yourself, learn-by-doing, work-within-the-budgetary-constraints school of guerrilla filmmaking.  Grabbing shots when you can, improvising on the fly and making the most of resources (have use of a set for an extra day or so?  Shoot more film for the next project).  There are interviews with a good many of the A-list talent that passed thru the Corman School of Filmmaking and learned their craft from him:  Jack Nicholson, Ron Howard, Martin Scorsese, Peter Bodganovich, Robert DeNiro, Willliam Shatner, Jonathan Demme and the like (though, no interview with Francis Ford Coppola?).  For good measure, we also hear from Roger's wife, Julie, who has been his filmmaking partner for decades.  We also hear from actors less-known by the mainstream, but well known to serious indie filmwatchers:  Dick Miller, one of the great cult actors, who was in many of Corman's films; Mary Woronov, and Pam Grier (who saw resurgence in Quentin Tarantino's ""Jackie Brown"").

Really enjoyable documentary, with about  hour of nice (but not essential) extra interview footage and `messages to Roger'  also on the DVD.  And, it will likely have you seeking out some DVD's of key films you may not have seen, that are discussed in-depth, such as ""The Intruder"", ""The Trip"", ""Hollywood Boulevard"" and ""Jackson County Jail"".  Though, sadly, several of the interviewees in the film passed away in the last year or two.",1332633600,,3023,5.080971659919029
5013494,4,B006QS9MKE,"Roger Corman's story is amazing and this documentary helps to show that though he was the master of the ""cheap"" film he was incredibly creative and an inspiration to many of the greats in the industry.  It is amazing who got their start with him (Peter Fonda, Jack Nickleson, William Shatner, Robert DeNiro, Peter Bogdonovich, Martin Scorcese, Frances Ford Coppala, Bruce Dern to name a few).

Thoughout the documentary we see Corman still filming in current times and he still makes those inexpensive films with the same zeal as he did over 40 years ago.  The documentary shows many of his films that were the inspiration for huge Hollywood hits like Easy Rider.  Somebody stated that Roger could make Lawrence of Arabia well for a half million dollars by filming the entire film in a tent.

We get incredible insights into the making of many of his films especially from Nickleson and Bogdonovich.  It was interesting that the movie The Terror had no plot and Corman used one of the actors to explain the whole plot of the movie to another actor in one scene.

It was a very interesting documentary especially because he made all these films on a shoestring budget. I was pleasantly surprised by this film and it is one of the better Hollywood documentaries that I have seen.  Should not be missed!",1332633600,,1300,4.721238938053097
5013495,5,B006QS9MKE,"I had low expectations for this documentary about B Movie Mogul Roger Corman, but not only were my expectations exceeded, I soon found myself intensely wrapped up in the story and impressed by the impact Corman has had on the movie industry. He has produced over 400 films, and directed more than 60, but as influential as these films were, perhaps his biggest contribution to cinematic art is in the talented actors and directors he nurtured: Jack Nicholson, Peter Bogdanovich, James Cameron, Ron Howard, Peter Fonda, Pam Grier, Dennis Hopper, Robert De Niro. It was while the Avatar director was working on the special effects for Battle Beyond the Stars for Corman's New World Pictures, a sci fi remake of Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, that Corman uttered the famous phrase: ""James, is the Camera on?""

Actually, Cameron isn't mentioned in this documentary at all, but there are numerous interviews with the others, as well as great clips from a lot of Corman's classic films. Though Quentin Tarentino didn't ever work for Corman, he is interviewed and acknowledges his debt to the man, and is included as an honory graduate of the school of Corman when Corman is given a lifetime achievement Oscar from the Academy--an award that is as over due as it was unexpected. Jack Nicholson is literally in tears when he details what the man meant to him, in spite of the fact that Roger refused to pay Jack more than $5 over scale for a script. Corman's frugal habits cost him Easy Rider, so he missed out on producing one of the most lucrative independent films of the 60's. There would have been no Easy Rider had there been no The Wild Angels, so that had to hurt.

Corman was on top of many trends in film making: horror movies, women in prison, blaxploitation films, and films geared towards a teen age audience. His series of Edgar Allan Poe films starring Vincent Price were classic, but he couldn't pass up using the sets for shooting The Terror on the weekends, in spite of the fact that he didn't have a script, and the resultant film made no sense whatsoever.

Just as he had set the stage for Easy Rider, but failed to cash in, the documentary discusses two very successful films that used his tried and true formulae, but with bigger budgets. Jaws and Star Wars were huge successes, but they made it harder for a maverick like Corman to produce films on a low budget. Producers of big budget films were much less willing to take risks, so creativity took a hit. Corman walked away from his own company when they also tried to reign him in, starting over again with New World Pictures making films with low budgets, but creative freedom.

One other interesting aspect of Corman's career was a film called The Intruder which starred William Shatner as a racist who goes down South to stir up trouble during the civil rights struggle. This film was a struggle to make, and it was a struggle to get it shown. I have never heard of this film, but it looks to me like it deserves to be seen. Also, it would be interesting to see Captain Kirk as a White Supremacist. Beam me up, Scotty.

The Bottom Line is that Corman's World is a very interesting documentary that shows the tremendous impact Corman has had, and continues to have, on the zeitgeist. It puts his career in context, and it would be of great interest to serious students of Cinematic Art, and lovers of drive in, grind house films alike.

5013496,5,B006QS9MKE,"Peter Biskind's book, Easy Riders, Raging Bulls chronicles the history of 1970's ""New Hollywood"" cinema bookended by the two title movies.  It is a period that is looked on fondly by film fans and critics alike, and it may have not existed except for Roger Corman.  While Corman wasn't responsible for these movies directly, he did help start the careers of many of the people who were responsible for the era, people who are influential even today.  People like Jack Nicholson, Martin Scorcese, Peter Bogdonavich, Francis Ford Coppola, James Cameron, Joe Dante, Peter Fonda and the adult Ron Howard.

Many of these actors and directors appear in Corman's World, a well-made documentary that provides not only a biography of Corman but also shows just how influential he was (and continues to be).  Even in his early days, when he briefly worked for the studios, he had a role in developing one of the first adult westerns, The Gunfighter.  Not given any credit for his contribution to that classic, he went out on his own, making a series of low-budget B movies.

These films tended to be exploitation fare, especially focusing on monster movies.  Corman had a good sense of the market.  Catering to the drive-in crowd - principally teenagers - he would go beyond horror and make biker and drug films as well.  What really makes these movies stand out is that he didn't condescend to his audience, unlike the major studios which tended to have a more ""establishment"" view of teens.

For the most part, Corman did not make great movies, but that wasn't his goal.  He wanted to entertain, but he wanted to do it cheaply and efficiently.  Eventually, with a series of movies based on Poe's works and featuring Vincent Price, he'd demonstrate he could make good movies.  When he started focusing less on directing and more on producing, he began to have a bigger influence.

Based on his movies alone, Corman was no Hitchcock, Ford or Hawks, but his role in developing talent may be one of the greatest of any filmmaker.  In addition, he helped make the independent market flourish.  Though well-deserved, it is also rather ironic that he would eventually be given a Lifetime Achievement Oscar.  Corman knew he was not making award-winning fare, but as this movie well demonstrates - through interviews with many of the big names mentioned above, as well as the amiable Corman himself - what he achieved went way beyond what showed up on the screen.",1332547200,2,2446,4.824940047961631
5013497,3,B006QS9MKE,"This movie was a lot of fun.  It is a documentary on the life and works of Roger Corman - one of the most prolific film makers of all time - the king of the drive in movie.  Though most of his films (well maybe all of his films) are considered ""B"" movies - if you are a film lover, you have to know and appreciate his films for what they are.  He is a true lover of the media and is still churning out film after film today.

This documentary includes interviews with many of the stars who got their start or break in his films - DeNiro, Jack Nicholson, Ron Howard... and each of these interviews is conducted with love, admiration, and honesty.  There are many clips from the various films included, which is why this is not for the little ones.  Anyone who knows Corman's films knows that Boobies and Blood abound. I highly recommend viewing this movie if you are a film student or a fan of the B-film genera.  But I can't say that it's something I would purchase for multiple viewings.  I'm glad I saw it, but would not recommend buying it - it certainly rental worthy.",1332547200,2,1072,4.246305418719212
5013498,5,B006QS9MKE,"""Corman's World"" is, simply put, a fascinating documentary about the man who sometimes was referred to as the ""King of Exploitation"" cinema.

Roger Corman's film credits include ""The Wild Angels"", The Edgar Allen Poe films with Vincent Price and Jack Nicholson (""The House of Usher""  ""The Pit and the Pendulum"") and others too numerous to mention.  He is the subject of this documentary by the A&E Network's Alex Stapleton.

Fresh out of Stanford with a degree in engineering, Corman worked exactly four days as an engineer, decided it wasn't for him, and then went to work for 20th Century Fox as a messenger and later, as a script evaluator.  The rest is history.

What is astonishing is the sheer number of the cinema elite whose careers were launched with help from Corman.

Interviews with  David Carradine, Jack Nicholson, Peter Bogdanovich, Robert DeNiro, Peter Fonda, Pam Grier, Ron Howard, Eli Roth, Martin Scorcese, William Shatner are strong highlights of the film.  Each interview contributes insight into the influence of Roger Corman as not only a Director/Producer, but also as an instructor and mentor.

Awarded a Oscar as a Lifetime Achievement Award by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Corman is still active in the film industry.  His philosophy concerning filmmaking has influenced generations of producers and directors, and will continue to do so.

At just a little under two hours, the film ""Corman's World"" is evenly paced and laced with humor.  With film clips interspersed with interviews, the film moves along at a quick pace, and does not drag.

Most of the amazon reviews at this point are from Vine reviewers who have given ""Corman's World"" five stars, and I can't disagree.  I especially recommend Annie Van Auken's review.  I also - very enthusiastically - recommend this film.",1332547200,,1825,5.053511705685619
5013499,4,B006QS9MKE,"I didn't realize that the legendary producer/director Roger Corman is still at it these days, as is shown in the opening scenes of this documentary when we see him in 2010 on the set of ""Dinoshark"", yet another one of those wacky and improbable disaster/terror movies.

After that sort introduction, ""Corman's World: Expoits of a Hollywood Rebel"" (90 min.) goes back and looks at the very humble beginnings of Corman's film career. The number of stars who are interviewed for this documentary is nothing short of amazing. Just to name a few: Martin Scorsese (who directed his first movie for Corman), Ron Howard (likewise), Jonathan Demme (likewise), Peter Bogdanovich (likewise), William Shattner (first starring role for Corman), John Sayles, David Carradine, and, last but not least, Jack Nicholson, who also started out his career under Corman both as an actor and a writer. Just amazing.

The latter part of the documentary focuses more on New World Pictures, the indie-studio Corman founded, which cranked out exploitation movies in the 70s faster than you can say ""Rock 'n' Roll High School"". Everything is done tongue firmly in cheek, but when all is said and done, the contributions from this pioneer of a certain brand of movie-making are clear, and it is only right that the movie ends with Corman receiving a Lifetime Achievement Oscar for his body of work. This documentary will delight and keep the interest of any movie buff, whether you are a fan of Corman or not. Highly recommended!",1332460800,2,1500,4.996
5013500,5,B006QS9MKE,"CORMAN'S WORLD is one of the most entertaining documentaries that I've seen in many years about a Hollywood personality.  It's fast moving, informative and very funny.

Directed by Alex Stapleton, the film features interviews with many notable alumni of the ""Roger Corman School of Filmmaking,"" including (in no particular order) Martin Scorsese, Ron Howard, Jack Nicholson, David Carradine, John Sayles, Pam Grier, Peter Fonda, William Shatner, Bruce Dern, Peter Bogdanovich, Jonathan Demme, Peter Fonda and many more.

Corman is perhaps the most prolific and influential filmmaker in the history of the medium.  His career spans over six decades and includes such ""legendary"" exploitation movies as ATTACK OF THE CRAB MONSTERS, ROCK ALL NIGHT, and THE UNDEAD, as well as more memorable offerings like THE PIT AND THE PENDULUM, THE RAVEN, THE WILD ANGELS and THE TRIP.

True, none of his pictures ever won Oscars or will ever wind up on the American Film Institute's ""Greatest Movies"" list, but Corman's contribution to the film industry goes well beyond artistic recognition.  He created a new guerrilla method of movie-making; a way of working with a ""bare bones"" budget, while creating a finished film that looks like it cost ten times what it actually did...and also makes a profit.  Additionally, he also gave young, emerging talent, like those mentioned above, opportunities to hone their craft before they went on to bigger and better things.

And, Corman does not believe in Hollywood's ""gray list"".  I was in my fifties when I first started to write (and direct) for Roger Corman, and I will be forever grateful to him for making my lifelong dream of ""making movies"" come true.

5013501,5,B006QS9MKE,"Take a look at this list of Actors - Jack Nicholson, Tommy Lee Jones, Sylvester Stallone, Robert De Niro, Bruce Dern, William Shatner, Lee Van Cleef, Dick Miller, Charles Bronson, Vincent Price, Peter Fonda, Dennis Hopper, Harvey Keitel, David Carradine, Pam Grier and Mamie Van Doren...

Or this list of Directors, Writers and Producers - Martin Scorsese, Ron Howard, Peter Bogdanovich, John Sayles, Joe Dante, Paul W.S. Anderson, Eli Roth, Quentin Tarantino, Jonathan Demme, Gale Anne Hurd and Francis Ford Coppola...

What have they all got in common? The answer is Producer, Writer, Director, Mentor, Career-Break Giver, Cheapskate and Sordid Exploitation B-Movie Legend - ROGER CORMAN. So why don't you know this? Well that's what Alex Stapleton's 2011 documentary film ""Corman's World"" is about.

It begins in the late Forties with two horrid years in the American Navy where Cadet Roger William Corman from Detroit, Michigan wilfully goes up against every order and gets a ludicrously high amount of demerits. He cannot stand authority of any kind. Roger then takes a job for 8 weeks reading crappy scripts at 20th Century Fox - says screw this - and decides in 1954 to make a film of his own - a black and white called ""Monster From The Ocean"". He does everything himself and on a budget of nothing minus zero (they show hilarious footage of his glowing one-eyed monster) and our boy's off and running. Some decades later and at the sprightly age of 82 - there's a staggering 384 more films where they came from (he's Directed 55 of them). And in between all that managed to procure a loving and talented wife Julie and four kids...and millions of movie-going admirers (many of whom are now Industry giants).

What's fascinating about this fabulous story is the huge number of genuine stars Corman knew and gave a break too - and who take time out to acknowledge this. Jack Nicholson in particular - who seems to owe his stunning career to the man - is so witty and self-deprecating that he's worth the price of admission alone. Ron Howard is characteristically generous too (got his first Director's spot under Corman) and has hilarious anecdotes about dangerous stunts in borrowed cars. Genius Writers and Directors John Sayles and Peter Bogdanovich give insightful glimpses into Corman's sometimes cavalier yet utterly driven personality - always sticking it to 'the man'. While ""Boxcar Bertha"" gave Martin Scorsese and his troop of stunning actors an outing and the maestro his first Director's Chair.

But what really tickles the funny bones is the endless parade of film clips - exploitation movies you haven't seen in decades - or not at all. Most were made without safety or permits - where an explosion is pretty much mandatory - where crass is good - and if it can be made for less than the dollar price of Scrooge's underwear - then that's even better. Blood spatters, cleavage pops, hoodlums do what hoodlums do, monsters invade from outer space (Lee Van Cleef sorts out a mutant bug with a canister blowtorch), crocodiles chomp on limbs, massively endowed ladies ponce about on the planet Venus with telepathy but very few clothes...and cars eat people...all of it thoroughly delightful.

But in between all this B-Movie/Drive-In fodder are moments of breakthrough - 1962's ""The Intruder"" - a serious film about racism down South starring a first part for William Shatner that nearly got all involved killed. And while his flicks might have been the wrong side of pump-action nudity drivel - his own personal tastes favoured proper art-house films of the European and World schools. So Corman used his distribution company `New World Pictures' to give Fellini, Bergman, Truffaut and Akira Kurosawa movies their only American releases.

Corman also made eight Edgar Allen Poe films with Vincent Price including ""The Pit And The Pendulum"", ""The Masque Of The Red Death"" and ""The House Of Usher"" which are now revered as classics of the Horror genre. He used genuine Hells Angels in the biker movie ""The Wild Angels"" (the character Heavenly Blues gives the quote that titles this review), spoke to the teenagers of America with the Sixties culture flick ""The Trip"" (popped LSD to be authentic) and followed that nugget with the biggest independent cult film hit of all time - ""Easy Rider"" - which made global superstars of Jack Nicholson, Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper.

But not to leave crass behind - for the Seventies - we get the Downton Abbey warm glow of ""Women In Cages"", the Nobel Prize for Humanity and Niceness in ""Death Race 2000"", the Mozart-complex melodies of The Ramones in ""Rock 'n' Roll High School"" and flesh gobbling fishy in the artistically fulfilling ""Piranha"". What a man and what a life!

The 30-minutes of Bonus Features have extended interviews and special messages to the great man. Aspect ratio is Full Screen and of course varies with the Source while Audio is a Basic 2.0. There are no subtitles.

In some respects - to blab and reveal more - is to do you the viewer - an injustice. Suffice to say that ""Corman's World"" is one of those cool insider peeks at the history of 'alternate' movies and the independent side of Hollywood. But perhaps like the chipper curmudgeon himself - this wonderfully uplifting and funny documentary is largely unknown and criminally under-appreciated.

5013510,5,B006QS9MKE,"The biggest surprise in Alex Stapleton's 90 minute CORMAN'S WORLD documentary is watching Jack Nicholson dissolve into tears as he reminisces about his dear friend Roger.

Ron Howard frankly admits in a bonus extended interview that his next biggest career thrill to winning an Oscar was Roger enabling him to direct his first picture,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grand-Theft-Auto/dp/B00000IMCT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grand Theft Auto</a>&nbsp;(1977).

After he created a couple of noteworthy student films, Martin Scorsese tells us that out of the blue Corman offered him the chance to direct&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boxcar-Bertha/dp/B00005UM2Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boxcar Bertha</a>&nbsp;(1972), an opportunity he jumped at.

Now widely considered Corman's masterpiece, at the time its volatile subject matter, race relations in the South, led to ""Intruder"" being banned all over the country. It was a rare money loser for Roger, one that almost cost him his home.

""Corman's World"" opens with a humorous collage of cheap-o fright film gore, car wrecks and other mayhem, then quickly segues to the open air set of Dinoshark (2010), where Roger is shown monitoring the day's shoot. Near the conclusion, Corman accepts an honorary lifetime achievement Oscar.

Obviously, there wasn't enough time to show clips of or discuss all of the Roger Corman ""classics"" we've come to know and love, yet a considerable number are spotlighted. In order, these are:

5013511,4,B006QS9MKE,"This is certainly an entertaining and engaging documentary about Roger Corman, featuring candid interviews with many Hollywood legends -- most notably Jack Nicholson and Martin Scorsese -- but it ultimately tells casual moviegoers what they likely already know about Roger Corman: most of the significant American directors to emerge in 1970s got their start with Corman.

The documentary fails to clearly explain that Corman was able to make films so fast and so cheap because his mastery of the film medium was as great as someone like Hitchcock. Corman keenly understood how to economically assemble a story through editing, that simply from juxtaposing two images he could convey a wealth of information to viewers. He once joked that through careful editing he could make a film about the fall of the Roman Empire with two extras and a sage bush. His point was that you can tell an epic story without everything being a long static wide shot to show to audiences how many extras you could afford to pay at once and structures built on a set like ""Ben-Hur.""

My other issue with the documentary is that it could have gone into more detail about some of Corman's films, such as his Edgar Allan Poe series, which are not only really good movies, but helped reboot the horror genre. By the 1950s the genre reached is nadir with movies that were made as cheaply as possible without any regard for quality (and Corman was a prolific maker of these movies).&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Fall-of-the-House-of-Usher-1960/dp/B00005AUK0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""The Fall of the House of Usher"" (1960)</a>&nbsp;helped bring respectability back to the genre -- it was shot in color and Cinemascope and was fairly cerebral (not to mention there being no monster in a painfully fake custom). Thanks to the film's massive success (as well as ""Psycho's""), studios began producing high quality horror films over the next two decades, such as ""The Birds,"" ""Rosemary's Baby,"" ""The Exorcist,"" ""Jaws,"" ""Alien,"" and ""The Shinning,"" to name a few.

Overall, the ""Corman's World"" is a fun watch, but Corman deserves a more analytical look at his career.",1361404800,2,2186,5.275862068965517

Roger Corman made pictures that were made primarily to entertain and make enough money to continue on to the next one. Economic and budgetary challenges were actually advantages, from my perspective and humble opinion, forcing Roger and his colleagues to get very creative in bringing their visions to reality. Some of it may even be considered as ""art"" today(Masque of the Red Death, anyone??). This is a fun and entertaining look back at Roger and his ""world"". I could have done without some of the pseudo-celebrity participants chosen for their insights, but I still enjoyed it overall. Worth a rental.",1359676800,,728,5.024793388429752
5013513,4,B006QS9MKE,"His name is legendary in the movie business. He has produced over four hundred films without ever losing a dime. He is responsible for discovering such talented actors and filmmakers as Robert De Niro, Jack Nicholson, Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, and many others. And now, his story is finally being told in CORMAN'S WORLD: EXPLOITS OF A HOLLYWOOD REBEL from director Alex Stapleton. We are talking about the great Roger Corman, commonly discredited as being the 'King of the B's' for his contributions to the low-budget, 'Do It Yourself' brand of monster movie that he helped to create throughout the 50s and 60s. As CORMAN'S WORLD stands to prove, Roger Corman was much more than just a cheap schlock peddler, but a trendsetter, a shrewd businessman, and a studio outlaw. From his earliest beginnings with films like MONSTER FROM THE OCEAN FLOOR and THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS up through his most recent features like DINOSHARK, Stapleton looks to cover as much of Corman's expansive career as possible in the time allotted. While best known for his exploitation films, Stapleton also explores Corman's critical successes like THE INTRUDER, a progressive and provocative film about Southern racism that sadly proved to be his greatest commercial disaster. Corman explains first-hand how the failure of his finest film would shape his methods in the decades to follow, teaching him the importance of subtext in art.

The title, EXPLOITS OF A HOLLYWOOD REBEL, perfectly encapsulates Corman's guerrilla style of filmmaking. No permits, no supplies, no time, and no money -- these things were of no concern in the Corman School of learning. Great directors like Ron Howard, Peter Bogdanovich, and Joe Dante were taught to think on their feet -- quite literally, in some cases. Stories of recycled set pieces, run-ins with the cops, and biker brawls come out as Peter Fonda, Bruce Dern, and others recall their crazy experiences both on and off set. In the 50s, Corman fought the studios by delivering pure entertainment for audiences to enjoy, films that fought the establishment with their rebellious teen characters. By the late 60s and 70s, Corman broke new ground with THE WILD ANGELS and THE TRIP, embracing the counter-culture movement in an enlightening new way. CORMAN'S WORLD finally recognizes these bold and often dangerous undertakings, which paved the way for future classics like EASY RIDER.

Featuring archived interviews, classic clips, and tons of new footage taken with a wide range of entertaining personalities, CORMAN'S WORLD is an insightful and engaging documentary that film fans are sure to enjoy. The only place where Stapleton falls short is in humanizing his subject, and showing the man behind the movies. We only see brief glimpses into the real Roger Corman through interludes with the director and his wife. The film is otherwise a finely-edited and extensively-researched tribute to one of the greatest producers of all-time.

He was the first real indy film maker on the Hollywood scene as it were. There are a lot of big name actors featured in this documentary, and it was fun to discover some who I hadn't realized had got there big breaks in Roger Corman films.

5013517,4,B006QS9MKE,"First off I consider myself a huge fan of Roger Corman and his unique life's work. I've read about him over the years and saw my share of tv or bonus material interviews with him. But someone in this case A&E and director Alex Stapleton smartly decided to do a documentary on the great Mr. Corman . The film is very well done with the only quibble being that it emphasizes the early part of his career from the 50's and 60's over his 70's and 80's work with New World Pictures and New Horizons video. I've seen a wide variety of his work from his drive in era fare like Little Shop of Horrors and The Wild Angels thru his 70's peak with a slew of gems like Rock-n-Roll High School, The Great Texas Dynamite Chase and Piranha  to his recent made for Syfy Channel fare .If you want to share Roger's world you need to be committed,be willing to work really hard for short money ,be innovative and take chances and never let budget limitations make you settle for less. The interviewed people range from huge names like Martin Scorsese ,Jack Nicholson,Ron Howard and Peter Bogdanovich to known commodities like Joe Dante,Dick Miller,Mary Woronov,and Pam Grier. You also get to meet and know his family wife and business partner Julie and brother Gene and longtime friends like Polly Platt who know the man not just the filmmaker. Actually you don't really get to know him all that well but I think it's safe to say that he like most people like some privacy. The sheer amount of talent Roger has given opportunities to is amazing .Suffice to say Jack Nicholson and Peter Fonda as well as the late David Carradine owe a huge debt to Roger for his casting and helping to develop projects with and for them. Martin Scorsese who is kind of muted in his praise as compared to some of the others does admit to learning from Rogers way of making films fast,organized and structured. Nicholson and Howard you can tell are really friends of his as they almost gush over him Jack even cries at one point. And the younger generation of film makers is represented here by Eli Roth and Paul W.S. Anderson who acknowledge that they grew up watching and are inspired by the works of Roger Corman. Scorsese makes an excellent point in that it's important that the younger people learn about and learn from Roger Corman as he's getting on in years ( but still working) and there will never be anyone else ever like him again. Anyone who's a fan will eat this up. Others who want to know more about a different way and of a different era in film making should check this film out. And on a side note Shout! Factory has been releasing a steady diet of Corman Classics on dvd of which I own many .I recommend that the hardcore fans and the generally curious both pay them a visit.",1349740800,,2756,4.446640316205533

This documentary covers the alternative approach to making movies in Hollywood. Not exactly what we were expecting, a bit of a disappointment.

It reveals how complex it is to make movies. A film that has a well funded budget, has the necessary resources to cover up the details, but with B-movies, you truly understand the challenges presented by the script, editing, crew, camera angles, acting, story-telling... and we get to appreciate even more the ability to put all together and deliver a film that catches audiences the world over.

Roger Corman is notorious in making B-movies, low budgets, simplicity, quick turnarounds, over 400 movies delivered in the past few decades.

Not what we were expecting, for we wanted to know more about Mr. Corman, but got lots of insight as to his methods of filmmaking and his personal views on the industry.",1346630400,2,1250,4.966507177033493
5013519,3,B006QS9MKE,"Trying to nail down the true extent of Roger Corman's influence on modern Hollywood is next to impossible, and a daunting task for any filmmakers.  Having touched upon or helped launch so many careers, not to mention his own huge cannon of work, Corman is one of those names that has become synonymous with the art of movie-making.  I was really hoping that this documentary would encapsulate his entire body of work, but unfortunately it tends towards his more recent direct-to-video fare and neglects to really examine large portions of his work, stuff like the Poe films with Vincent Price.  If nothing else it's well shot and is a beginning to telling the larger story.  Maybe we'll get a sequel that fills in the gaps?",1345593600,,723,4.76
5013520,5,B006QS9MKE,"When you think about great Hollywood filmmakers does the name Roger Corman come to mind? Probably not would be my guess. What might come to mind is the image of a somewhat enigmatic figure of a low budget, movie maker considered to be one of the most influential definers of the B-Movie genre. In fact I would go as far to say that he was the prototype of what was to come. Descriptive words that come to mind when I think of any Corman film are; silly, outrageous, cultish and exploitive. To be perfectly honest I'm not impressed by Corman's cinematic catalog.

And yet with that said here I find myself writing a review on a Roger Corman tribute documentary. Who would've seen that coming? What I was to discover by viewing this entertaining, informative and surprisingly illuminating DVD was that Roger Corman was a powerful, positive force in filmmaking history of Hollywood.

Among Corman's many achievements during his long career probably the three most important would be:
1- He proved it was possible to survive as an independent filmmaker in a studio monopolized industry.
2- Corman was singularly responsible for giving more new talent their first opportunity in front of and behind the camera.
3- Roger was singularly responsible for bringing foreign films out of the obscure, small market art houses and into mainstream theaters. Thus finally opening the genre to the greater public-at-large.

Watching this DVD sure changed the way I now think about Roger Corman. Most of his films still don't interest me, but the legacy he left behind and the things he accomplished that don't appear on the movie screen were amazing. I now openly applaud the man and his career.",1342483200,,1678,4.8807017543859645

Like Katzman, Corman was a master of selecting a target audience and assembling films that lured them to the theater (and the drive-in).

5013525,2,B006QS9MKE,"If someone had absolutely no idea who Roger Corman was, they would only get a fleeting and far-from-complete notion of him from this DVD.  With way too much emphasis on his more recent, direct-to-video schlock one would hardly know that this amazing man is actually responsible for many, many very good movies!  Why waste so much time on sleazy crap like DINOSHARK when Mr. Corman is responsible for both producing AND directing a damn good movie like FRANKENSTEIN UNBOUND?  We see the poster for X - THE MAN WITH THE X-RAY EYES behind Mr. Corman in several of the interview segments - yet learn zip about it - or PREMATURE BURIAL or ST. VALENTINE'S DAY MASSACRE or VON RICHTOFEN AND BROWN or SECRET INVASION and so many more fine films. The Vincent Price/Poe cycle is barely touched upon.  More time is spent in this documentary razzing the notoriously bad THE TERROR than praising any of the truly wonderful Poe films. On the sole basis of this documentary, Mr. Corman comes across as merely a slightly more evolved Ed Wood Jr.  But the truth is Corman has true artistic talent - and not just for predicting and capitalizing on cinematic trends or being the godfather to so many talents that soared beyond the stratosphere and on to the stars that they eventually became whilst Roger Corman remained earth-bound.  Make no mistake about it.  The man is an artist.

The luminaries who are interviewed for this documentary are mostly wasted.  The majority of them have very little to say.  Robert DeNiro is gone in the blink of an eye.  Why was Bob Burns even bothered? Quentin Tarantino's contribution is mostly stock. Unless I blinked and missed something, why is there no mention from Peter Bogdanovich of Mr. Corman's pivotal role in the making of TARGETS, the film that launched Bogdanovich's directing career?  And where is Ron Howard walking to during his interview - and why does he end up in a graveyard?  Where is a whisper of DEMENTIA 13, the film that launched Francis Ford Coppola's career?  Where is a whisper of the names of Vincent Price and Boris Karloff?

Corman's World?  Hardly.  More like a small slice of it...and not the best slice of it at that!",1339545600,32,2168,4.723404255319149

5013529,4,B006QS9MKE,"If you grew up in the sixties or seventies more likely than not you spent countless hours at parked at the local drive in watching movies that were never going to win Oscars but were always entertaining in various ways. Horror movies would give you goose bumps, action flicks blew up countless buildings and T&A films titillated the masses. One common thread among all of these genres of films is director/producer Roger Corman. And with CORMAN'S WORLD we finally get an on film look at the man and his movies.

The documentary follows Corman from the early years when he began until the more current Corman, producing movies that most often end up on the SyFy channel. In his earlier days, Corman was a director who had a talent for making a marketable product for very little money. Those films became the fodder for drive ins across the country. While low budget the ingenuity and creativity displayed were amazing. I'll grant that they weren't top of the line movies, but there was heart to them and entertainment always. IT CONQUERED THE WORLD, CARNIVAL ROCK, NOT OF THIS EARTH, ATTACK OF THE CRAB MONSTERS, ROCK ALL NIGHT, MACHINE GUN KELLY, WASP WOMAN and BUCKET OF BLOOD are just a few of the movies that Corman directed during the 50s. Then he took off in the 60s.

During that time he began with a little movie shot in several days called LITTLE SHOP OF HORRORS. A staple on late night horror host shows across the country, it was a beginning of cult status for Corman. In 1960 he took off when he directed the first of several films he made based on the stories of Edgar Allan Poe with FALL OF THE HOUSE OF USHER. This was soon followed with PIT AND THE PENDULUM and PREMATURE BURIAL. Corman's use of color and stylistic forms are noted to this day by film makers around the world.

But Corman didn't just make great movies. He also helped up and coming film makers and stars get the chance to get into the business as well. One was a young actor who was quite unknown at the time but who Corman gave more opportunities than one: Jack Nicholson. In the documentary here Nicholson gives Corman the credit he deserves for helping him along when he got started, coming to tears at one point.

Other notables who Corman gave opportunities to who appear in the film with candid interviews include Martin Scorsese, Paul Bartel, Peter Bogdanovich, David Carradine, Joe Dante, Jonathan Demme, Robert DeNiro and Bruce Dern. All either starred in a Corman film or directed films for him.

But the movie isn't just a tribute to the man. It follows his career from those early B-movies through the creation of his first company, New World. Disappointed in the way films were being green lighted and made in Hollywood, Corman started the company feeling that he could offer movies made on lower budgets but that had something going for them. They were also a chance for movie makers who had dreams to get the chance they needed. An example of that is a man who discusses the way he was able to break into directing. Long before he made films like THE DA VINCI CODE, FROST/NIXON, A BEAUTIFUL MIND, RANSOM, APOLLO 13, PARENTHOOD or BACKDRAFT director Ron Howard was given his first chance to direct by Corman with the film GRAND THEFT AUTO. The movie did great for a small film and began Howard's directing career.

One would think that would be enough but it isn't. Corman went on to make more films as a producer and even at 80s now hasn't stopped. He's been producing films for the TV network SyFy now going back to his roots using CGI instead of a man in a rubber suit. If you've seen DINOCROC, CAMEL SPIDERS, CYCLOPS, SUPERGATOR, DINOSHARK, DINOCROC VS SUPERGATOR and the like, you've seen a Corman film.

This documentary follows the time line of Corman's life, from those early black and white low budget films through the honorary Oscar he received. It has been a life filled with great and bad movies, with friends that have stayed with him and recognize him to this day that he made decades ago. It shows a man who made movies that might have displayed some artistic value along the way but whose main goal was up front, to make money. To do so means you have to make movies that people actually wanted to see and Corman always did that. He's famous for making the statement that he never lost money on a movie he made (with one exception, THE INTRUDER which is discussed in this film). Having produced over 400 movies that's quite an accomplishment.

If you've never heard of Roger Corman, don't be surprised to discover that he's been involved with more than one movie you've seen. His list of credits available at imdb.com is amazing. This film does him justice with interviews from numerous people from his past and present. It gives short glimpses into the various genres of movies he made. And it pays tribute to one of a dying breed, the Hollywood mogul. Corman deserves to be included in the ranks of Selznick and Mayer. While a rebel when it comes to how Hollywood works, Corman has been one of its biggest players of all time. Watch this film and find out how.

On a last note I defy anyone to watch this film and not find themselves thinking back fondly to some of the movies he made and that are discussed here. Chances are you'll click on to amazon.com and place an order after watching.",1336953600,,5306,4.565126050420168
5013530,4,B006QS9MKE,"""Corman's World: Exploits of a Hollywood Rebel"" follows Roger Corman's filmmaking career from the first film that he produced, ""Monster from the Ocean Floor"" (1954), until the prolific director received the Academy's Honorary Award in 2009. Corman was producing ""Dinoshark"" (2010) while this documentary was being filmed, so we get a look behind-the-scenes on that movie. Otherwise, Corman's story is told with interviews and archival footage. As in Corman's autobiography ""How I Made a Hundred Movies in Hollywood and Never Lost a Dime"" (1990), there is no shortage of big Hollywood names who have a lot to say about Roger Corman. The figurative ""Corman School of Filmmaking"" was much-appreciated and remembered fondly by its students.

As Roger Corman has produced over 400 feature films to date, there is hardly a name in Hollywood who hasn't worked with him. Corman kept Jack Nicholson employed for a decade. Martin Scorsese's second feature was for Corman, as was Ron Howard's first. They are interviewed, as are Peter Bogdanovich, David Carridine, John Sayles, Robert DeNiro, Jonathan Demme, William Shatner, Peter Fonda, Pam Grier, and Bruce Dern, who is, oddly, interviewed while getting a haircut. Brother Gene Corman and wife Julie Corman also weigh in on Corman behind the scenes. Gene talks about the one film that didn't make money, ""The Intruder"" (1962), about racial segregation in the south, also the only Corman film that was not of the exploitation variety.

There is more about actually making the films and Corman's influence on the industry in this documentary than in his autobiography. The book naturally discussed what was important to Corman, while the documentary is more about how other people view and experience his brand of gorilla filmmaking. Corman is famous for making movies on a shoestring budget, even shooting more than one movie simultaneously to reuse the sets. From both the book and the film, I got the impression that his stinginess bordered on the obsessive and that he tends to conserve resources for its own sake even when it is not practical. But the movie gives more insight into why he always stuck to low-budget material, which had more to do with his insistence on control than anything else.

Corman was a seminal influence on the generation of filmmakers that got their start in the 1960s and 1970s. He discovered the youth market before the studios. He had an uncanny sense for what people wanted to see and integrated the latest hot topics into the most basic thriller plots. He made the biggest-grossing independent films. He made the movies on which some of our most iconic films were based. It was smooth sailing until major studios caught on that exploitation and B-movies could make big box office, and they started to make them on A-budgets in the 1970s. Straight-laced and anti-authoritarian at once, Corman could hardly have been more influential, yet he ghettoized himself as a filmmaker for reasons that were not entirely rational. Ironically, he was probably more influential, but less lauded, as a result than he would have been at the big studios.

The DVD (Anchor Bay 2012): Bonus features are ""Special Messages to Roger"" (15 min), in which people interviewed for the film and some that were cut, direct personal messages to Corman, and ""Extended Interviews"" (13 min), which are deleted scenes. There is also a trailer (2 min). Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH and Spanish.",1336953600,,3460,5.064912280701755
5013531,4,B006QS9MKE,"This was an interesting documentary on one of my favorite filmmakers, Roger Corman. I've become a big fan of Corman's in the last couple of years, thanks in part to Shout Factory for releasing several of his cool films on DVD in special editions. Some of my favorite Roger Corman movies are Humanoids From The Deep, Big Bad Mama, Not of This Earth (starring Traci Lords), and Hollywood Boulevard, and some clips from a couple of those movies actually made it into Corman's World. There are so many people interviewed for this documentary, including Jack Nicholson, Ron Howard, Joe Dante, Robert DeNiro, and one of my favorite actresses Pam Grier. Corman's World is interesting, but it would have been better if more attention would have been paid to the 70's and 80's era, since my favorite Roger Corman movies were released during that time.

There's no denying Roger Corman is responsible for getting some of Hollywood's biggest names their start and they're all here to talk about working with him among clips galore. For better or worse that about sums it up. While I really enjoy seeing Corman and the interviewees reminiscing about the films they've worked on it feels a little light. I would love a 2 disc edition with trailers and/or interviews focusing more on the movies themselves to round it out, which is why I'm not giving it the full 5 stars.

This film was a treat.  We see interviews and commentaries from several of his stars, directors, producers and so on.  We even get to listen to Roger himself -- film clips from his early days and his current commentary as he has an Apple computer in front of him.

Independent film-making is tough and Roger says so.  His acumen is great; his willingness to buck the trend amazing.  More blood, more explosions, let's do it!

Side Note:  I met Roger at a signing of his rereleased Pirhana, along with Joe Dante.  Great bunch of guys and I thanked Roger for all his work on the Price movies. After this DVD, I have even more astonished admiration for the man.

I would have thought it would have been included because it was one of the few (if only) times Corman got the backing of a major studio. I've read that he came away from the experience feeling disgusted at how the studio was seemingly willing to waste lots of time and money during the production. He gladly went back to producing his films through A.I.P. after this. Despite the omission, it's still a great documentary and I would highly recommend it.",1334966400,3,779,4.777777777777778
5013535,5,B006QS9MKE,"Roger Corman has been called the ""King of the B Films"" but that's really an inaccurate title.  Some directors are ""B"" filmmakers simply because they are not very skilled.  That, however, is not the case with Corman.  Corman was a budget-conscious filmmaker by choice.  Corman learned when he first got into the business in the early 1950s that if he didn't want to be controlled by a studio he had to make independent films.  Corman's World is a full-length documentary dedicated to a true maverick among directors.  A man who disregarded the studio system to make the kinds of films that he wanted.  Films that had a modest budget an always made money. Corman's career began with ""Swamp Women"" in 1955 and continues today as he serves as Producer for many films made direct for video or for the Syfy channel.  Corman has directed or produced (oftentimes both) over 300 films.  Perhaps Corman's best known films were the series produced in the 1960s and based upon the stories of Edgar Allan Poe and usually starring veteran horror actor Vincent Price.  Films like ""The Pit and the Pendulum"", ""House of Usher"", and ""The Masque of the Red Death"".

While Corman is best known for horror/monster films, some of his most critically acclaimed pictures were in more mainstream films.  ""The Intruder"" in 1962 tackled the subject of integration in southern schools at the height of racial unrest in the country.  1966's ""Wild Angels"" featured a young Peter Fonda that would catapult him to star in ""Easy Rider"" just a few years later.  But perhaps Corman's greatest contribution to the film industry was that he gave many young actors and directors their starts in the business.  This list reads like a who's who of Hollywood elite: Jack Nicholson, Francis Ford Coppola, Peter Bogdanovich, Martin Scorsese, Joe Dante, Jonathan Demme, Robert DeNiro, and Ron Howard.

The film includes interviews with all of these men along with many others who worked with Corman over the years and what strikes you is the reverence that they all have for him.  The documentary concludes with Corman finally getting the recognition he deserved with an honorary Academy Award in 2010.  This is a wonderful documentary featuring a legendary filmmaker.",1334707200,,2224,4.948787061994609
5013536,5,B006QS9MKE,"This 89-minute tribute to the King of the Bs is informative and enjoyable. Corman, who made a hundred films in just his first ten years, is seen here in multiple archival interviews as well as footage shot for this documentary, some of the latter on location in Puerto Vallarta on the set of the Syfy channel's Dinoshark.

'Exploits of a Hollywood Rebel' reiterates the winning Corman formula perfected over many years, from American International Pictures to his own New World Pictures: critic-nauseating but crowd-pleasing films, shot on low budgets and in short time frames. Corman: ""We feel a monster should kill somebody fairly early and then at regular intervals through the picture."" [No laugh track, folks!]

Also featured are many graduates of the Corman School, including Martin Scorsese, Peter Fonda, Ron Howard, Peter Bogdanovich, and Jonathan Demme. But it is Jack Nicholson, whose career was sparked and sustained by Corman for a decade starting with 1958's The Cry Baby Killer, who offers the most heart-touching praise: ""By mistake, he actually made a good picture every once in a while. I was never in it.""

In addition to honoring its namesake, this documentary is an excellent retrospective on independent filmmaking. It was a 2011 Sundance entry, a fact the DVD case fails to mention. The film was shorter than I might have liked--easily remedied by watching some classic Corman flicks--and at times it is suitably low-budget, in keeping with the material! Lots of clips from decades worth of B-movies. Don't miss the ""Special Messages to Roger"" featurette.",1334534400,,1577,5.15234375

But This Doc is way to light and not as informative as Corman's own bio ""How I Made a Hundred Movies in Hollywood and Never Lost a Dime "". This seems more like an excuse for the Director of this doc to get some facetime with some famous people who he no doubt hopes will help him in some way. How else do you explain comlete and total hacks like Eli Roth and Paul ""What Script?"" Anderson who've never made a single decent movie in their careers? the thing about Corman's movies is that there was a charm to them that is totally lacking from the works of people like Roth and Anderson.

Seriously, skip this and buy Roger's bio instead.",1334361600,3,949,4.301675977653631
5013538,5,B006QS9MKE,"You may not be able to name any of legendary director Roger Corman's films (if you happen to be lame), but you would be surprised at just how far the supposed ""King of B's"" reach extends beyond the grindhouse and exploitation fare that he made his name on.  The list of A-list directors and actors who owe their very careers to the man is extensive to say the least, and in this documentary, a good lot of them are brought out to pay tribute to the man who broke them into showbiz.  ""Corman's World"" is an eye-opening look at a man who defines 60's-70's cinema and to this day remains a primary influence on our pop culture landscape.  This is simply one of the best-made documentaries about film that I've seen and you should not pass it by under any circumstance.

At one time, Roger Corman liked to brag that he'd ""made a hundred movies and never lost a dime.""  At over 80 years of age, that number is now over 400 and counting.  Some were awesome (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Race-2000/dp/B0038SUBEG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Race 2000</a>), some were unwatchable (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Raptor/dp/B00005NOOY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Raptor</a>), some were cool (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Piranha/dp/B002ZG98KK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Piranha</a>), some were classics (anything with Vincent Price based on a Poe story) and some were just average (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Dunwich-Horror/dp/B00005K3OC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Dunwich Horror</a>), but they were all his and they were all done his way, outside of the Hollywood studios and often financed out of his own pocket.  Speaking of Pirahna, it's funny because I always thought of it as a rip-off of Jaws, but as one interviewee in this documentary pointed out, there is nothing more Roger Cormanesque than a giant shark eating a skinnydipper.  Hard to argue that point.  When it comes to exploitation, there is no argument to be had: Corman is king.  I've seen giant maggots rape women to death, I've seen women behind bars, I've seen elderly people lined up to be run over by a dragon car, I've seen Pam Grier rock my world every which way, I've seen motorcycle gangs and people buried alive and talking man-eating plants and a wasp woman with an appetite for male reproductive organs, and I've seen The Ramones' music blow up mice from an overload of awesome.  I've seen sexy catfights and heard voices from beyond the grave and mer-people invading our beaches to forcibly mate with our land women, and oh so much gore, sex, blood, violence; sheer madness.  Who do I have to thank for this wonderland of depravity?  Roger effing Corman, that's who.

If this all sounds like so much garbage to you, this film helps put it all into perspective and traces how the madness of Corman's World eventually led to the birth of modern blockbuster cinema.  And for the record, not everything Corman has done is throwaway exploitation fare.  Ironically, his attempt to make a serious topical film was met with near-riots and threats of violence when he released&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Intruder/dp/B000T5O46C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Intruder</a>, an anti-segregation film, in the midst of the South in the 60's.  The surtitle of this documentary is ""Exploit of a Hollywood Rebel"", but the fact is he never needed Hollywood as he often produced films entirely outside of the system.  It was Hollywood that needed him.  But as far as the ""rebel"" part goes, well the man's body of work speaks for himself.  Some of the better anti-establishment films ever made we have Corman to thank for.  The man did not play well with authority.  And even in spite of all the ""shlock"" and gratuitous nudity and senseless violence, in the end, even the snobs of The Academy could not deny Roger Corman the coveted lifetime achievement award.  That makes it official: NOBODY can deny the influence Corman has had on cinema.  As a low-budget producer who eschewed the unfathomable waste of big movie studios he had a reputation as the man who could ""negotiate the production of a film on a pay phone, shoot the film in the booth, and finance it with the money in the change slot"", and that is something to be proud of.

So back to the topic at hand.  Should you see this movie?  If you've ever loved a horror or science fiction film, yes.  If you've ever enjoyed a film with explosions, yes.  If you've ever been disappointed by a blockbuster and wished there was more to see, yes.  If you're familiar with the word combination ""Mystery Science Theater"", yes.  If you love movies, yes.  If you don't love movies, but want to understand why other people do, yes. Corman's World is an outstanding documentary on all fronts and even an old-guard exploitation fanatic like myself learned a lot from watching it.  So will you.",1333929600,2,5021,5.307206068268015

5013541,5,B006QS9MKE,"I see I'm late coming to ""the party"" for this 89-minute documentary which was made for the A&E Cable network as a tribute to the ""King of the B's"" - Roger Corman. At the beginning it seems like a cross-promotion for Corman's current project for the ScyFy Channel, ""Sharktopus"", but you soon realize that it's MUCH more than that. Featuring a list of A-list movie folk like Ron Howard, Joe Dante, Peter Bogdonovich, Peter Fonda, Robert DiNiro, Jack Nicholson and even Martin Scorsese, Director Alex Stapleton got access to all of these big names whose careers all started by working for Corman.

I'm sure it must have been as a tribute to Corman's eccentric low-budget films that Stapleton starts the film off with very scratchy NEW footage (no, don't think it's your TV!) and interviews all those folks I noted above in odd-ball locations. Nicholson is on his couch at his home (?) which looked pretty simple to me. Ron Howard talks while he walks through a neighborhood and later in a cemetery! Peter Bogdonovich is captured in a fancy house (his?) and what looks like Thailand (or could it be a movie set) and Bruce Dern's interview is being conducted while he's getting a haircut!

I won't go into more details since others seemed to have covered that, but will provide a few pieces of info that may not have been listed earlier.

The DVD - I got the standard DVD, not the Bluray - had two bonus features. First is a 13-minute section of extended interview; second is a 15-minute collection of ""messages to Roger"" from the interviewees. Sort of a happy 80th birthday tribute. The former is a nice bonus; the later has a few new pieces of info but is more of a throwaway.

I'm not a big fan of Corman's films but found this documentary well done and entertaining and would recommend it to any film student and lover of the history of motion pictures. And, of course, any die-hard Corman fan.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

5013542,3,B006QS9MKE,"This movie feels a bit like a love letter to Roger Corman rather than an documentary of his career and his impact on the world of cinema.  Corman is, of course, best known for perfecting the art of the cheap exploitation film, whether through horror (PIT AND THE PENDULUM), crazy action (DEATH RACE 2000), crazy, violent women (BOX CAR BERTHA) or any number of cheesy movie featuring women having their tops ripped off or men getting their legs torn off.  The movies are universally pretty bad, but feature an energy and a zip that seldom makes them less than amusing.  Corman also gave starts to many HUGE filmmakers (Martin Scorcese, Francis Coppola, Jonathan Demme) and actors (Jack Nicholson, Peter Fonda).  But he never made that leap to critical and commercial acclaim himself.

From this film, featuring comments from various co-stars and collaborators as well as lots of thoughts from Mr. Corman himself, you would at most think that Corman was held back perhaps by being a tightwad and not wanting to give up control.  But it's hard to say for sure.  He seems personable enough (in his old age), but why, then, do the folks who owe him (it would seem) have little in the way of admiring things to say.  Nicholson, for example, is amused by his memories, but also remembers how he left Corman behind because the guy wouldn't pay him one dime above union scale.  There's very little LOVE in what those who knew him have to say.  Thus, I can only assume that there must be a darker side to Corman that isn't explored.  I don't know that for a fact...but the film feels like it skirts around those possibilities.  It also never really comes to grips with explaining how it is that Corman clearly never felt like he needed to get better as a filmmaker.  He exploited trends, whether the hippies of the '60s or insane popularity of JAWS in the '70s.  Arguably, he started a few trends of his own, such as the biker movies that eventually led to EASY RIDER.  But mostly he toiled in his tightwad independence.

The best of this documentary is simply enjoying the generous helpings of clips from Corman's films.  They are almost universally hilarious, and thus the film is a pleasant jaunt through the works for a B-movie specialist.  But the film seems to want to make Corman into something more important, someone worthy of a ""lifetime achievement award...and it fails to make its case.  Corman's films are better than Ed Wood's work, because he had the savvy to surround himself with folks who had real talent, but hadn't been discovered yet.  They toiled for Corman, got discovered, and moved on.  It is this breeding ground for better talents that is probably Corman's only truly significant legacy...yet those he helped get started seem mostly just amused and vaguely embarrassed by Corman.",1333238400,,2797,4.749482401656315

It traces the man known as ""King of the B's"" from his beginnings as a messenger at Fox through his directorial exploits and on to his efforts with his own mini-studios, producing some of the most legendary exploitation movies ever made.

Perhaps the most telling thing that comes out of this documentary is the sheer number of interviews with legends whom Corman started.  Peter Fonda, Ron Howard, Joe Dante, Jonathan Demme, Pam Grier, and of course, Jack Nicholson, just to name a few of the luminaries contained in these frames.  The interviews with Howard and Nicholson are particularly funny and moving.  Howard's stories about Grand Theft Auto<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ron-Howard-Action-Pack-Eat-My-Dust-Grand-Theft-Auto-Roger-Corman-s-Cult-Classics/dp/B004NJC0J8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ron Howard Action Pack (Eat My Dust! / Grand Theft Auto) [Roger Corman's Cult Classics</a>] are priceless, and Nicholson's interviews are both funny and moving.

I'll go over there right now!'

There's an unexpected warmth at the heart of the documentary.  Through the lens of the filmmakers, we learn that Corman is a man with true passion for film, even while cranking out exploitation by the ton...and his friends, followers, and proteges share this same passion.

5013545,5,B006QS9MKE,"I would often see Roger Corman having breakfast at Jerry's Deli in Studio City.  I like to think we dined together even though I was at the next table.  He was often alone and seemed to cheerfully hold court with a few would-be filmmakers who would nervously make a movie pitch or he would warmly exchange greetings with old friends.  I remember his rosy cheeks and very neat attire.  He seemed unusually refined and meticulous in his appearance and manner and he always seemed eminently approachable and genuinely friendly.

This wonderful new documentary about Roger Corman is really a celebration and tribute to this prolific, and still very active, B-movie filmmaker who never made a movie that lost money and also gave a career start to directors Francis Ford Coppola, Martin Scorsese, Jonathan Demme, James Cameron, Joe Dante and actors Robert De Niro, Sylvester Stallone and Jack Nicholson among many others.

CORMAN'S WORLD: EXPLOITS OF A HOLLYWOOD REBEL is more than a celluloid toast to his low-budget B-movie factory that cranked out genre exploitation films.  It's also a reminder that Corman also picked and distributed Truffaut, Bergman, Fellini and Kurosawa films.  In fact, for many of us, it was Corman who introduced us to these great foreign filmmakers.  Corman also directed a few well-received titles like the Edgar Allan Poe's THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH. Alex Stapleton's terrific documentary is a career-spanning look at Corman and his remarkable filmic output.  What's especially moving are the testimonials from some of his now famous pupils who of course were all unknowns when he hired them.  Jack Nicholson actually weeps when he recalls with gratitude the life that Roger Corman gave him.",1332979200,,1718,5.1

It's a pretty stunning list, and each adds their own perspective on Corman's unique charm and tremendous creative energy. The film charts the course of Corman's career, from an unknown maverick filmmaker to B-movie mogul, and how the era of 1970s genre blockbusters (such as ""Jaws"" and ""Star Wars"") took the air out of his tires, as major studios subverted the indie ethos and made it into a big bucks business. This reverent documentary will serve both as a great introduction to Corman's work and his influence, and as a celebratory keepsake for pop-culture fans who are already Corman devotees. Fun film!

5013547,5,B006QS9MKE,"Roger Corman may very well be the most influential director you've never heard of. The king of low-budget cinema, Corman began his B-movie career back in the 1950s and came to prominence in the '60s and '70s, when he pretty much ruled the cult movie circuit, working with a number of notable actors and directors ""before they were famous."" Corman's World: Exploits of a Hollywood Rebel, is last year's documentary chronicling Corman's illustrious career, and while it may not offer as complete a picture as some enthusiasts might hope, it's nevertheless an affectionate, informative, and, above all, entertaining look at a cinematic giant who has touched more lives than many realize.",1332806400,,684,5.171171171171171
5013548,4,B006QS9MKE,"Roger Corman is a product of a very bad system:
he made the worst sci fi with as little taste as possible.
He invented exploitations of different markets,
like Blacks and Kung Fu. He gave a lot of young
people chances in movies they might not of had.
When he did try to do something good in ""The Intruder"",
he got good reviews and the film bombed
(actually seemed to explode in human terms in the theater).
He is just very good at making cheap production line
films on a very low budget.
This DVD is history that doesn't make Hollywood look very good.",1332806400,2,551,4.3076923076923075
5013549,5,B006QS9MKE,"There's a quote on the packaging for this disc that touts a quote from a .com site that says ""If you are a film fan, this is a Must-See.""  I'm in complete agreement.

As a child that grew up in the 60's and 70's, I got a lot of exposure to Roger Corman's films or to films that were inspired by Roger Corman, as his influence in Hollywood is well beyond the 6 degrees of Kevin Bacon that most of us have come to know and laugh and joke about.  While I would quickly note that Corman's reputation as the king of the budget films is well deserved, something that I'd also note, which is driven home in this biography, is that he also put a lot of hard work and dedication to his craft.  Corman's insistence on squeezing every bit of value out of his sets and locations and his budgets is a good part of the reason many of his films look as cheesy as they do.  Never mind the obviously fake shark from Jaws, or the models with the wires showing on them or boom microphones that are hanging in the visible area of the film, Corman's films had effects that were as bare minimal as he could get away with, even as in the later half of his peak years the studios began spending more and more on making big budget effects laden films.

Corman's collaborators include a virtual Who's Who of well known names, Ron Howard, Jack Nicholson, Martin Scorsese, Robert Deniro, Pam Grier and others.  There's also one of the first acting opportunities for William Shatner in a film that should have garnered a lot more respect than it did, 1962's The Intruder, a film that many would find incredibly offensive and racist.  Sadly that film failed to find commercial success and the lack of success and reception probably resulted in many more explotation films and other films that many might look down upon, though we should all keep in mind that The Intruder came along well before Corman had made many of the films that we know him for today (his 100th film came in 1966's The Wild Angels).

The film on this disc, Corman's World, is a very informative biography that offers fans and film historians alike the opportunity to learn more about Corman and also gives us an opportunity to gain insight into some of the workings of independent studios and the film making processes that grew up with and around Corman and his collaborators and those that were influenced by all of them.

Thankfully, in the last few years, Corman's work was recognized by the Motion Picture Academy of America and he was granted a lifetime achievement award.  It is nice to know that he was alive and well and able to enjoy receiving this award rather than receiving it posthumously.

Give this really nice tribute a viewing when you get a chance.  Even if you opt to go with Amazon Instant Video over purchasing the DVD or Blu-ray of this one, it's worth taking the time to sit through.  The DVD comes with extended interviews and special messages to Roger Corman in the special features.  The actual biography is about 90 minutes in length.  Warning that some of the archival footage is gory and perhaps disturbing for those that easily get queasy, though seen in context, it's not that bad and certainly nothing compared to some of what we see in modern slasher/horror films.

Thanks Amazon and Anchor Bay for the opportunity to view this one prior to it's release.  It was a great treat and something I'll really enjoy having in my collection.",1332633600,,3409,4.515447154471545
5013550,5,B006QS9MKE,"Alex Stapleton has created a devoted, endearing love-letter to one of cinema's great achievers.  For decades, Roger Corman has been creating some of the cheesiest, occasionally amazing, frequently god-awful films imaginable.  He did it by revolutionizing the filmmaking process: shoot quick, shoot cheap, shoot with what you have at hand.  That frequently meant a close circle of friends, borrowed props, even actors in multiple roles (in his first Corman film, character-actor Dick Miller actually played both an Indian and the cowboy who shot said Indian).  It's a process that not only consistently made a profit, but also helped usher in an entirely new style of cinema, perfected by directors such as Kubrick, Coppola, and Scorsese (the latter two got their start under Corman's tutelage).  In one of the better interview sequences, Corman protege Jack Nicholson says: ""By mistake, he actually made a good picture once in a while.""

There are many great things about Corman: his legion of famous followers and students; his straight-laced appearance versus his ""almost Communist"" political views; his thorough knowledge of filmmaking without ever attending film school.  CORMAN'S WORLD manages to capture both Corman's irresistible personality, as well as a thorough insight into how his views of making films has evolved over the years. (""We feel that the monster should kill somebody fairly early, then at regular intervals,"" a young Corman quips.)  The story unfolds through a series of interviews that are, at times, blisteringly honest (Nicholson grins at the camera and exclaims that, if Corman had offered him a higher percentage, ""EASY RIDER could have been yours!"").  It's never boring, as Stapleton actually brings a Grindhouse feel to the film (check out the first half of the closing credits, as well as the documentary's trailer).  It's also relatively short, so that one's attention span really doesn't have much time to wander. Not that this is ever a major threat; Roger Corman's legacy is absolutely fascinating, and Stapleton's documentary captures it perfectly.  If you're at all interested in the craft of filmmaking, you should do yourself a favor and watch CORMAN'S WORLD.  You just may learn a thing or two from one of cinema's great professors.",1332633600,,2273,5.283333333333333

8503135,4,B006QS9MKE,"This documentary is decent but ultimately it is a bit disappointing. I've read Corman's biography and a lot of the commentary in this documentary comes straight from that book.

It's production values are good as it has interviews with many hollywood icons who reminisce about their days working for Corman. What's here is good, it's just not what I was hoping for. I was looking for more in depth information about the earlier part of his career and maybe some new stories. What we get is just a smattering of information from the various parts of his career. Still, what's here is pretty good.

Recommended for Corman fans and independent movie makers.",1460160000,,654,4.830357142857143

I watched it on Amazon streaming rentals.
My perception was the sentiment of his honorary Academy Award was wasted on Corman. He's just not a sentimental guy. It was like ""funerals are for the living.""
All the old guys that started with him wanted to make sure the honor happened. He's still churning out low budget, almost unwatchable honeys.",1436400000,,561,4.793814432989691
