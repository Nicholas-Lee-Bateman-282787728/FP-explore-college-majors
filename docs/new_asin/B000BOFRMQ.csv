8090197,1,B000BOFRMQ,"I'm highly interested by contemporary music, so this DVD really caught my eye, especially since Simon Rattle is a highly respected conductor and advocate of modern music.  The film aims to give an overview of the evolution of music from the romantic era of Strauss to the most revolutionary composers of the 20th century such as Boulez and Stockhausen.

However, it proves globally disappointing.  We are made to listen to short excerpts of music, sometimes so short that the work is utterly misrepresented (just a few end chords of the ""Marteau sans Maitre,"" without the soprano!).  The work chosen to help us discover Britten, who is best known for his remarkable operas, is an excerpt of a terribly archaic-sounding work, which certainly fails to represent the originality of this great composer.  In sum, the great majority of the movie is just images of orchestras playing pieces of music, interrupted from time to time by images of waves crashing on a beach and other commonplace clichs.  I can listen to great pieces of contemporary music anytime I like, but I expected this DVD to offer more and help me better understand the music.

One would have hoped that Sir Simon Rattle would shed light on the technical aspects of these works and call our attention to some remarkable subtleties, or at least put the compositions in a historical perspective, but his comments remain largely superficial and often highly impertinent.  On the subject of Stockhausen's ""Gruppen,"" the main focus of the movie, he admits, ""I don't pretend to understand this work.  I just like the way it sounds.""  Wow.  I could have said the same thing, and so could anybody.  This highly trained musician doesn't have any deeper thoughts about this great work?

As a bonus, we have the entire ""Gruppen"" filmed live in front of an audience.  This is perhaps the best part of the DVD, since at least we get to listen to one work in its entirety.  However, the performance is so badly filmed (jumping incessantly from one view to another, and one camera consistently out-of-focus!) that in the end I preferred to listen with my eyes closed.  And don't the musicians all look awful in their color-coded denim outfits!  Oh well.

I rented this DVD at my local library, and it certainly doesn't make me want to purchase the rest of the series.",1376784000,4,2316,4.820253164556962
8090198,5,B000BOFRMQ,"The DVD is fantastic on its own - includes excerpts from Strauss: Four Last Songs; Schoenberg: Survivor From Warsaw; Webern: 5 Pieces for Orchestra Op. 10; Boulez: Marteau sans maitre; Britten: Serenade for Tenor, Horn and Strings; and Stravinsky: Agon, in addition to Gruppen. Other two conductors for Gruppen are John Carewe and Daniel Harding.

Camerawork is musically sensitive, and there's even a brief rehearsal clip of just the three conductors working it out amongst themselves.",1166486400,9,486,5.394736842105263
