It's the very best sit-com that i can recall, oh the humanity.  I enjoyed it ever so much.",1344124800,,139,4.074074074074074
7835458,4,6302993814,"If you enjoyed the series WKRP, you will REALLY enjoy this. If you never saw WKRP when it aired as a weekly sitcom, you will STILL get many chuckles out of the dialogue.",1261785600,,169,4.151515151515151
7835459,5,6302993814,"I am sincere that this is the best Christmas episode of a sit-com that I have ever seen.  They do their own version of Dickens' ""A Christmas Carol.""  Mr. Carlson acts like scrooge about giving out Christmas bonuses to the team at WKRP.  Then, he eats one of Johnny's brownies, falls asleep at his desk, and that's it!  You will laugh if you know the characters from WKRP, for sure.  And I am convinced that you will laugh even if you don't them.  A VERY well done adaptation of the classic story to the series.",1137801600,7,510,4.315789473684211
7835460,5,6302993814,"Yeah, it's in Cincinnati.  I mean why can't we get WKRP on DVD?  There are so many inferior and less popular TV shows out there for sale!  C'mon! Like the man says, we want it and we want it now!!!!  Are you listening?",1100736000,16,218,4.0
