8590484,5,B00D7VW8QI,"Very nice, substantive selection of easy steps that you can dance in a small space. Nothing flashy, but plenty of enjoyable attractive dancing. Mostly closed position, with numerous changes of direction crossing the track. You have enough variety to look good if you have good styling. Really really appropriate selection for someone new to NC2S.",1516838400,,346,5.3090909090909095

8590487,5,B00D7VW8QI,Excellent instructional DVD. This is not a difficult dance to learn. This DVD starts at a beginner level but moves quickly tho intermediate patterns. A brand new beginner may want something a little more basic. If you take I couple of group lessons and understand the basics then I highly recommend this dvd,1430524800,2,307,4.811320754716981
8590488,2,B00D7VW8QI,"Only the first basic step is broken down. After that, there is no individual footwork shown. If you already know the dance and just want a refresher or can learn just by watching a couple dancing and saying, and now we do this.. it may be a good choice for you. If you are a beginner that wants the steps explained and shown - Kristin Ham's Nightclub Two Step would be better. Overall this DVD was frustrating. There are many patterns shown, but you are stumbling around trying to figure out how they are done. This might work for people who need very little instruction.",1426291200,,571,4.447619047619048

If you want to learn a dance, why not learn it the right way the first time.  I give both of them a 10.",1383091200,,274,3.9272727272727272
