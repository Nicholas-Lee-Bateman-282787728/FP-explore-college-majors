1866416,5,B00008XRYS,"Martin Short matches
wits with comedy legends
with a fat suite on.",1071446400,4,66,4.583333333333333
1866417,4,B00008XRYS,"Martin Short in a disgusting fat suit as a talk show host with no clue who his celebrity guests are let alone what he's talking about.
Could it get any better?
yes, it could, and therefore 4 stars. Why a Best Of? Why not the whole Comedy Central first season? And second season? The show is in it's third season, and I'd buy all three.
The show is incredible funny. Glick is a ..., and Short plays several hilarious characters that reoccur. As Glick, he carries on conversations that go off into tangents, as well as insulting REAL celebrity guests (Levy, Conan O'Brian, Steve Martin etc...) VERY reminiscent of SCTV.
And you HAVE to see Glick dry ... Kathy Lee Gifford! HILARIOUS!
The series is THAT good.",1060560000,4,706,4.566929133858268
1866418,5,B00008XRYS,"""Primetime Glick"" has got to be one of the stranger spin-off ideas in television history: a character rescued from the short-lived ""Martin Short Show"" gets a late-night-style interview show on Comedy Central and makes it big.  In it, Martin Short plays the title character, an overweight, hyperactive, half-fawning, half-obtuse interviewer that sits down with one or two of Hollywood's biggest comedic talents every week for interviews that are played as real - as long as the interviewees can keep from laughing.
In this collection, we get five episodes from the first season (2001) of ""Primetime Glick"" which actually amounts to half the season.  Why they couldn't just give us the first five episodes of the season instead is beyond me - maybe they're using the release to gauge consumer interest.  Anyway, along with four really funny episodes featuring Bill Maher, Steve Martin, Dennis Miller, Jerry Seinfeld, Janeane Garofalo, basketball star John Salley, Conan O'Brien, Eugene Levy - and a surprisingly bad episode featuring Kathy Lee Gifford and Darrell Hammond doing his ""SNL"" Dick Cheney - the disc also includes added material from the Seinfeld, Martin, Gifford, O'Brien and Garofalo interviews (in some cases longer and funnier than the stuff that was put in the episode) and a few other goodies from Comedy Central - a ""Glick"" segment featuring Julia-Louis Dreyfus, a ""South Park"" segment and a ""Crank Yankers"" segment.
In all, this show has been a pleasant surprise treat for me, and I was pleased at how good the DVD was given the rather low price.  I hope that Comedy Central will get around to releasing full seasons at some point, but until they do, this is a surprisingly good ""Best of"" collection.",1054944000,86,1717,5.056537102473499
1866419,5,B00008XRYS,"i ran out & picked it up the day it came out. if you are a fan of mr. short [or even if you've never even heard of him], you must own this dvd. unfortunately i don't get comedy central, so this has been my first opportunity seeing mr. glick in action. my only dissapointment was that this is not an entire season boxed in a set. it left me wanting more...much more!!
ps_just found out he's in development for a movie based on his character jiminy glick! this could become a trilogy that exceeds the funniest fat .... moments in austin powers! good luck martin & don't compromise with the script...keep it funny!",1052179200,3,611,4.368421052631579
1866420,5,B00008XRYS,"I had always found Martin Short's over-expressive antics and  routine comedies rather annoying and far from humorous. When Primetime Glick first came on Comedy Central, I had no desire to watch it. But then I kept seeing commercials where Glick (Short in a hideous fat suit) ripped into real celebrities during interviews. The clips were hilarious and I found myself tuning in.
How glad I was when I did.
Primetime Glick makes constant fun of Hollywood and the simple-minded morons who worship everything Hollywood does. The entire Entertainment industry is shredded by this mock talk show, and Short, as Glick, is the wonderfully obnoxious center of it all.
The interviews are the best part of this underrated show, where huge stars get insulted, interupted and even assulted by Glick who half the time doesn't know who the guest is nor does he care about them.
It's as if Glick speaks for the cynical at-home-viewer who always rolls their eyes in disgust when someone like Julia Roberst comes on TV and starts babbling about her latest movie. Glick simultaniously makes fun of Hollywood phonies (himself being one) and points out other Hollywood phonies for the insipid blowhards they are. And when he has a good guest on he still rips into them, all in good fun.
This DVD comes out right alongside the joyously surpirsing release of a third Season on Comedy Central. Just when everyone thought this show was dead and buried, it comes back with guests like Steven Spielberg, Ice Cube, Mel Brooks and Brandon Frasier.
Guests of this show have to have a good sense of humor and be a little masochistic, because Glick is ... relentless ...; fans of this show have to be a little hostile towards celebrity worship to truly get the humor of this.
For a great look at what makes the show so original and so excellent, pick up this reasonably priced collection. I'll get it as soon as possible, but I'll also be hoping for season sets.",1051747200,52,1930,4.7611940298507465
1866421,2,B00008XRYS,"Love Short, love the character, etc. this DVD, however, was woefully anemic when there are so many Primetime Glick moments that could have rounded out this very brief video. Martin Short is one of the greatest entertainers of our time.",1412208000,,235,4.9

1866425,5,B00008XRYS,I'm a huge Martin Short fan and his Jiminy Glick character is hilarious.  You will enjoy it and have a laugh-a-minute.,1384473600,,118,4.619047619047619

1866427,5,B00008XRYS,"There are only 5 interviews on this DVD. So this means there are two full seasons left out. Makes me angry. What about The Martin Short Show? Huge amounts of demand on bad youtube copies for all of these to be officially released. Hes acknowledged as by far the funniest character comedian  in the past at least three decades And  always admittedly a major inspiration Of such notables as Bill Hader Jim Carrey Will Forte and the list goes on.... I have them all on VHS. All brilliantly hilarious and a shame vaulted away when it can bring soo much joy to thousands. The best ones are left out for some reason. Martin Short is the only comedian clown master that can always truly bring me to tears from laughter. Please release it with all seasons Also the Martin Short Show . And if you have Netflix look out for Glick Don't Do Red Carpet. Made only for Netflix where he, Glick, gets one of the last interviews with the late Great Dennis Hopper.  And other award nominee's.  In Short...Martin Short is a genius.",1358467200,2,1012,4.483695652173913
1866428,5,B00008XRYS,"Giminy is an acquired taste.  At times this one seems to overstay its welcome, but seeing this short-lived show again is great.  Hilarity definitely ensues, although I think ""Giminy Glick in Lalawood"" in funnier.",1358380800,,212,5.205882352941177
1866429,5,B00008XRYS,My cousin posted a Glick episode on her website and I forgot how funny he was. I bought the dvd and it was good quality n it had maybe 5-6 episodes. It was great n funny.,1341964800,,170,3.75
1866430,1,B00008XRYS,"I've been a huge fan of Martin Short over the years and always tune in whenever he guests on a late night talk show. Just watching his famous over-the-top entrance is enough to make me happy because I know I'm in for a real treat.  But I'd only seen brief clips of his Glick show on YouTube. They were hilarious, so I purchased the Best of Primetime Glick.

Unfortunately, the full DVD got to be too much.  I was not prepared for how infantile, crude, and offensive he can be.  I watched about 3/4 of it, then donated it to my local library media center. I'm not disappointed about having spent money on the DVD.  I'm disappointed because my whole opinion of him is forever changed.",1337558400,,682,4.380952380952381
1866433,5,B00008XRYS,"This is hilarious . Jiminy Glick is annoying , self indulged , extremely dumb but still up there in LALA land .
His wife is as bad . Lot of fun to watch . I wish there was more .
Oh the stupidity ! LOL !",1317254400,,203,3.4347826086956523
1866434,5,B00008XRYS,"Such a great show, this DVD is just a glimpse of what the entire series was like. I hope that someday everything will be available on DVD. As for this release, it's an absolutely must-have for Glick fans or anyone who's just getting their first fix.",1294617600,,249,4.434782608695652
1866435,2,B00008XRYS,There were moments of sheer comic genius that had me rolling.  Mostly it was waiting for something interesting to happen.,1275436800,,121,5.05
1866436,5,B00008XRYS,"I've always had a love-hate attitude toward Hollywood.  I loved the imaginative, creative side of it all, but this fun side was always dampened somewhat by the self-important aloofness of the industry and the obsession with fame at the cost of substance.  Enter Jiminy Glick, Martin Short's own Frankenstein Monster, to wreak havoc upon this pretension like a bull in a china shop.  Unfortunately, I missed much of this show when it first came out, and was very happy to learn that some of it had been immortalized on DVD.

""Primetime Glick"" gives Martin Short a venue in which to unfurl his comedic genius like none other.  His old SCTV cronies are always on hand to contribute to the laughs, and skits like Lalawood Fables remind us of the town's sordid past, lest it take itself too seriously.  The celebrity guests are fun to watch, taken off guard as they are by the impertinent questioning.

My only critique would be that this didn't come as a box-set, because there was much much more I would have liked to have seen.  The menu was also a bit cryptic and I had trouble hopping from chapter to chapter.  I hope that the rest of this series will soon make it to DVD also, because I would love to have the entire collection.",1259366400,5,1229,4.55
1866437,5,B00008XRYS,"Martin Short's Jiminy Glick is a great character that parodies bad late night talk show hosts and self-centered interviewers/news folks who often make the story more about themselves than what/who they're actually talking about. This is a great character and I could (and have) watch the interviews over and over again and always pick up something new. There's so many funny little things and quirks to this character, I find myself continuing to enjoy this DVD. It seems Short's goal is to crack up his guests with unexpected questions and comments during the interviews. And that is really saying something when you're talking about Jerry Seinfeld, Ben Stiller, Steve Martin, etc. These guys are top notch comedians and Short's ability to make them laugh proves just how great he is.

So my only complaint is:

Why aren't the rest of the seasons out on DVD?

Hopefully someday...but in the meantime, enjoy this sampling of a great show.",1196726400,,938,4.961783439490445
1866438,4,B00008XRYS,"Martin Short's Jiminy Glick character is what television needs in our age of celebrity worship.  A sweaty, gluttonous, oblivious, clumsy, clueless interviewer who backhands his guests so deftly that I think they even miss out on the diss.

My favorite interview is with Jerry Seinfeld, another brilliant comedian who can think fast on his feet and keeps up with Short.  That segment is gold.

(Although it's not on this DVD, one of my favorite Jiminy questions was put to Mel Brooks on another show, ""So what's your beef with the Nazis?"").

I also find Mrs. Gathercole (Short made up as Jiminy's ancient, crotchety fan) hilarious, whether she's soiling herself and throwing her bloomers at her abused nurse or shouting out ""FORNICATE!""

Like all sketch comedy, some of it can be hit and miss depending on your tastes.  But when Jiminy hits, it's a homerun.",1135641600,19,856,4.902777777777778
1866439,5,B00008XRYS,"I've always found Martin Short funny, but now he takes funny to a different level.  He's normally quick anyway, but playing the lovable and yet annoying Jiminy, he's a whole new kind of quick and brings the humour up a couple of notches.  How the interviewees don't crack up all the time is amazing.  I'd be on the floor if it were me.  This is excellent and I highly recomend this.  There are great appearances by some great actors and it's very very entertaining.",1125792000,5,465,4.488095238095238
1866440,3,B00008XRYS,"I love Martin Short as Jiminy Glick. There's nothing funnier than a funny fat guy. I don't know how much of those interviews are improv, but if any of it is, it's great.  Martin Short has classic one liners, and comebacks. I wouldn't rate this DVD as GREAT, but certainly worth the buy. I forget how much I paid, but it wasn't much; and it produced laughter many times....Enough said ;)",1122854400,2,386,4.436619718309859
1866441,4,B00008XRYS,"I'm not a huge fan of Martin Short. I think there are better Canadian comics out there, such as Jim Carrey and Mike Meyers, but I was pleasantly surprised by this DVD. Short is surprisingly funny doing his improv talk show host schtick, particularly when going head to head with comedic greats like Bill Maher and Steve Martin. Michael McKean is terrific in the stereotypical band leader/sidekick role. Some material works and some doesn't but, for the price, I would have to say it's a worthy purchase.",1090800000,5,503,4.793103448275862
1866442,5,B00008XRYS,"Those SCTV fanatics finally got something to cheer about when Martin Short was given this incredible show. He brought back the tradition of that crazy show. Moreover, he brought back the members of it. Levy, Thomas and Flaherty all appeared on season one of Glick. This show is just so intelligent, so many little subplots with Adrian VanVoorhees, Dixie, Mason, Morgan, Matthew and Modine. I have never laughed harder at a show. I cannot get enough of Jiminy and his pathetic nature. Sadly, this DVD is rather brief. It is a best of and not a collection of the whole season. However, the deleted scene with Julia Louise Dryfuss is INCREDIBLE! Here is hoping that Comedy Central will bring this show back and release an entire first season DVD. Great great stuff.",1089072000,12,762,4.78030303030303
