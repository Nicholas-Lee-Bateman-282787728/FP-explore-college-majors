8435473,4,B004M40JSS,"South Korean horror that's not too scary but still plenty of tense situation and gore throughout. I love Korean horror films and this doesn't disappoint. A 2008 film in widescreen with 6.1 DTS surround sound and english subtitles. This is a region 3 DVD so a multi-region player is needed if playing in the states. I own both ""Death Bell"" and the sequel ""Death Bell : Bloody Camp"", both are good but I did find this one to be better. Basically, kids in a boarding school are trapped in to play a sadistic game of answering some questions correctly or someone dies. A good premise and well executed, plenty of blood and gore and still has its scary moments for the horror fans out there.",1391644800,,686,4.496
