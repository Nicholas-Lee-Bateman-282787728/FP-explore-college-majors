2629154,3,B000H6SY8C,"I preordered this before it was released.  I couldn't wait to see old stuff I hadnt seen reran since the '80's & early '90's.

Unfortunately there were only five season premieres & only a limited amount of bonus features.

It was neat to see Loretta Long & Bob McGrath in their prime, who are still on the show presently.  Sonya Manzano was so young looking, as well as Emilio DelGado & Northtern Calloway.  I didn't realize Raul Julia was a cast member as well. I also saw a couple other adult male cast members who were probably regulars during the first few seasons.

My favorite part was seeing the psychidelic, entertaining, trippy racecar spies # serial narrated by Grace Slick again (last I saw was during '90-'91 season & three was in the spotlight).  My other favorites were seeing the Jim Henson created ""baker-falling-down-the-stairs-at-the-end"" & mad painter (played by Paul Benedict) who paints #'s everywhere-&-becomes-a- nuisance # serials.  Only drawback, only one episode/one # being spotlighted in racecar spies & mad painter each.  There are two episodes of ""baker"" series but that's all.  It would've been neat to have other episodes w/other #'s being spotlighted in each of those series.  (the racecar drivers & spies are featured in full when ten is in the spotlight) Also missing was the pinball # count series(did it debut during the first five seasons?), the queen of six (similar to king of eight, most likely created & animated by Jim Henson as well), eleven blocks accompanied to funky soul music, ten tiny turtles, & any letter serials.  I miss seing the ink blot characters using their bodies & other to create the capital & lowercase (accompanied to banjo music w/an adult male announcing the capital & a little boy announcing the lowercase).  Same w/two other letter serials:  pulling a letter up the side of a building accompanied to funny, entertaining music in elapse mode & a letter moving around in outerspace like a meteorite & landing on a planet.  I wish there were more skits and shorts w/Bert, Ernie, & Kermit, especially very early first season when they each looked a little different.  There's a couple other Bert & Ernie clips where Ernie ends

up cutting all of Bert's hair off & pulls his nose off when trying to cover up Bert's sneezing but keeps putting it on different parts of his head.

On a more positive note, there's still some of my favortie clips: Big Bird presenting Grover doing chin-ups, both characters demonstrating heavy & light, & Ernie using Bert's nose on the bust he made. And the main thing, more time to talk about other things (crayon making-not in this set though, ""Everybody Sleeps,"" etc), # of the day, main letter of the day, & extra letter of the day.  Since season thirty ""98-'99 not enough room anymore w/Elmo's World, Journey to Ernie, & Ernie's Show & Tell.  I loved the first 29 seasons as some critics reffered to as a ""Laugh-In"" format.

It's great to buy for those of us who grew up in the '70's & '80's.  Todays children may ask ""where's Elmo, Zoe, Telly, Rosita, Gina, & Allen?""

I suppose it's worth getting to see stuff one hasn't seen for ages & to show newer generations how Sesame Street orig was.  But remember, pretty much the same two letters & same # on each premiere & no more episodes. (it would've been neat to see the episode when Maria moved in)

I hope another volume will be released w/more extras, different spotlighted letters(almost each episode spotlights ""D"" so you see the same clips & songs), & other #'s spotlighted in the orig # serials, as well as cast biographies & interviews.",1158969600,3,3590,4.733118971061093
2629155,5,B000H6SY8C,"After many years of fans begging the Sesame Workshop (formerly the Children's Television Workshop) to do a major release of ""classic"" material from the archives, it appears that they finally relented! I think the success of the Electric Company Set from several months back paved the way...

Let me start out by saying that I'm 29 years old and have been collecting this material for years. The bulk of what I've obtained came from the Noggin channel which was playing old episodes of Street from 1969 to 1989 until they stopped airing them a few years back.

I imagine most of the people interested in this set are familiar with the early years of Sesame Street. It was a chaotic, brilliantly conceived show from day one... very much a product of its time (the late 60s), and although the show was devised to teach kids, it was in its own way as revolutionary in format as Monty Python's Flying Circus was... extremely fast paced and chock full of highly imaginative, trippy animated segments (such as, for example the Racecars Spies number series, best described as a psychedelic freak out with dreamlike, surreal animation regarding numbers one through ten and sung by Grace Slick, then of Jefferson Airplane, in her own inimitable way)... And that's just the tip of the iceberg. For those of you who grew up being hypnotized, and yes, often frightened by the many strange, often subversive animated segments of the show (many of which are permanently etched in your brain; you'd be amazed how vividly some of these clips come back to you even after not seeing them for 25 years or more), still recall with affection the brilliant jazzy orchestrations of show composer Joe Raposo (who wrote the most sophisticated music ever devised for children's TV), remember hanging out with Mr. Hooper and a Gordon who actually had hair (there were actually two other actors who played Gordon before the current bald one we know and love), and loved the rougher, edgier quality of those early muppet segments, this is the release for you. After many years of Schoolhouse Rock being available for purchase (which I love too, but the early Street material is even better in my opinion), we can now look forward to this:

7 hours of classic content

5 complete hour-long episodes (slightly edited due to music rights issues)

Over 54 bonus segments, including:

The original pitch for the show - first time available anywhere!

Celebrity appearances from James Earl Jones, Jesse Jackson, Johnny Cash, Jackie Robinson

Classic segments every parent will remember: ""I Love Trash,"" ""Rubber Duckie,"" ""C is for Cookie""

Original animations including Ladybug Picnic, Alligator King, King of Eight

Hopefully this will be the first of many releases of classic Sesame Street! The second volume of the Electric Company will be released in November.",1158364800,285,2827,4.9451476793248945
2629159,5,B000H6SY8C,I truly miss the 'old school' Sesame Street' shows. Enjoyed watching with with the 3rd generation.,1504310400,,98,5.1875

2629161,5,B000H6SY8C,"I agree with the other reviewers who rightly complained about the fact that this is packaged in such a way that you are led to believe you are getting more than the few episodes. However there is bonus material and I still gave it five stars because I feel like I was transported back to being two years old. How is it that I remember all of the cartoon shorts? I'm 49 and watched this when it first aired in 1969. Obviously these have staying power.

Like any adult in the 21st century I am struck by the innocence and how so much of the content wouldn't be considered suitable for pre-schoolers today, which is stated in the beginning. For example, kids playing in a junkyard and a farmer who squirts raw milk from a cow's udder into a little girl's mouth.

I love the psychedelic feel to the cartoons and songs, especially Grace Slick singing the jazzy numbers song. Such simple, non-technical animations seem so much more meaningful to me than modern CGI, etc. The calming folksy music to accompany images of animals being cute may be offensive to cynics and dismissed as schmaltz, but not me! It's just so comforting and endearing.",1500595200,,1136,4.563725490196078

2629165,3,B000H6SY8C,"As much as I absolutely love Sesame Street, especially the older episodes, these DVD collections are disappointing. We bought all 3 volumes. Each volume only includes one episode per season, and sadly they reuse so many sketches. It would seem that if you only get 5 episodes to cover 5 seasons, you might not see the same song 2-3 times. Some of the sketches even show up again in other volumes. While I understand that repetition is good for children and their language development, when we bought these disks, the plan was definitely to watch it multiple times, so we don't need to see Ladybug Picnic or Jimmy John saying Up and Down on every disk.

Video quality is acceptable. But hasn't anyone noticed the unusually low volume or is it just my copy?

I was so far ahead of my kindergarten peers who went to preschool. I did not. I think I can attribute my compassion and sense of humor partially to SS. There are warnings about it not being appropriate for today's youth, I think this is the exact thing they are lacking! I have twins who are soon 17 months. I put in one of these and they are mesmerized. My son especially even gets and laughs at some of the jokes. I have put on current Elmo oops I mean Sesame Street and they hate it. They have NO interest. It surprised me but I was secretly proud. The changes they've made have really killed the show. I would love to buy every classic episode for my kids. We have Volume 2 as well.

2629227,2,B000H6SY8C,"I have a 3 year old and  was aghast when I tried to watch modern Sesame Street. It's nearly all Elmo and computer  animation,  and what is live action is over wrought in song: it could just as well be any other ""children's programming"".  As a result, I only watch the two seasons of  Classics with her which feature a variety of puppets (Grover... The Count) and simple, engaging songs and cartoons about the number of the day,  etc. *****I'd gladly buy a few seasons of the early years if they were offered****, but the price of these insane, there's only a few episodes on each, and overlap some with what is offered on Classics.

There's a reason on Netflix why the new compilation episodes are so lowly rated while the Classics are much better received. I feel like Sesame St let it's funding and the ratings game destroy what made it special. I feel the educational content is too low for an hour long show but, more importantly, I'm worried about the effect of the pace & production (tons of  bright,  fast CGI and constant singing). And as a parent,  Elmo's cheese grater voice is enough to send me sprinting across the house to FFW through what somehow became 15 full minutes of Elmo. When did Elmo take over the whole show? Does he have dirt on somebody?

Point being,  I'd never sit my kid down in front of Sesame St. broadcasting directly on PBS. And there's precious few programs that actually focus on basics like letters,  numbers, and shapes.

5 stars for content on these dad's,  1 star for value. $75 for less than a seasons worth of content makes me sick.",1432339200,,1573,4.48943661971831

2629235,5,B000H6SY8C,"At the beginning there is a disclaimer that these episodes are for adults only and may not be suitable for todays preschoolers. Too many lawyers involved I guess.  I researched this disclaimer and the following things are upsetting to some parents: Cookie Monster eats too many cookies, Oscar the grouch is too grouchy and possible smokes a pipe in one of the other sets, a kid rides his bike without a helmet, and in the first episode, a man walks a little girl around Sesame Street to introduce her too the neighborhood (anyone paying attention hears in the short conversation with his wife that a ""teachers meeting was cancelled"" so he is a teacher at the very least and you can imagine that Sally was in his class.  I have no idea why this is such a BIG DEAL.  I find none of these things upsetting or have the potential to damage my child since I am the mom and I am in charge of keeping my child safe and teaching her about safety. My kid is facinated, learning and having fun.  Grandma, who was a teacher and then administrator for over 20 years in elementary education in 3 parts of the country,confirms that the way they teach ABCs and counting is the best way.  The new kids programs don't teach in a systematic way and encourage a very short attention span, so I am very thankful that these Old School Sesame Street episodes are available.

2629254,2,B000H6SY8C,"How would you feel if the highlights of your favorite show as a child were reduced to 1 DVD per year (as Sesame Street Old School is)?  Ok, how would you feel if on this already truncated single DVD is only one full episode with about a dozen selected bits as extras?  This is what you are getting with SSOS, Vol 1.  Feeling pretty disappointed aren't you...?

The cheap skates at Public Broadcasting & Children's Television Workshop obviously think so little of their fans that this is their idea of a compilation DVD...  On the one hand, I loved the trip down memory lane and the ""1969"" episode that is included is the very first episode of Sesame Street, so it's an interesting picture into the beginnings of the show (Gordon #1, Oscar the ORANGE grouch, Big Bird who talks like he is a little demented, Mr. Hooper, and generally all the characters when they were young and exciting, unlike the more recent Sesame Street shows that are tired, rely way too much on Elmo, and don't intellectually challenge the kids).  In addition, the extra bits that included are all great, great memory refreshers.

But, and this is a BIG but, how can you release a supposed collection of DVD's that gives you so little?  One episode per year????  A dozen or so extra bits per year?????  Three of the twelve bits on 1969 are simply actors saying the alphabet.  Although it's neat to see Jackie Robinson & James Earl Jones from 37 years ago and this bit was a hallmark of Sesame Street episodes for years, it's hardly my idea of great television to watch someone speak the alphabet dead-pan (especially considering the DVD's are marketed to those of us who watched these shows as children).

These compilations held so much promise.  My only hope is that these are teaser DVD's and sometime in the future PBS/CTW will wake up and release larger collections.",1395705600,,1843,4.633846153846154

There should have been more episodes (to me, 5 isn't enough!), and more bonus features: like more behind the scenes footage, commentaries, interviews (maybe a few from the ""kids"" who were on the show), something like that to make it more appealing and worth the money!

So it's DEFINITELY my fault for ignoring that little guy.  However, I had thought to myself ""this is a CHILDRENS show- how bad could it be??  How can this be intended for adults?"" and proceeded to show it to my young son.

I'll tell you what's bad about it- the furry Muppet characters we see on screen are clearly ""beta"" versions of the characters we have come to know and love.  For example, Oscar the Grouch isn't green- he's a shade of orangey-red that makes him look like he's contracted some serious disease.  Not only that, but he's REALLY mean- not just grouchy.  He is a JERK.  The worst is Beta Big Bird- very scary.  His head is completely caved in, he speaks with a stutter, his body jerks around uncontrollably, and his eyes kinda roll back in his head most of the time.  All this could be very upsetting for kids who are used to the current versions of these characters.

The learnings scenes in between the street scenes are ok.  Some are a bit creepy- like one of the first ones where they explain where milk comes from.  The narrator just sounds like a creep.

2629316,1,B000H6SY8C,"Several issues with this product.

The first and most important is that it is not the entire series, spanning the time period as it indicates. It says Volume One - 1969-1974, but it's only three disks with the first having only 1 episode on it, the second only two episodes.  I expect the third to have similar features.  While the chosen episodes clearly come from the time period that spans 1969-1974, I wouldn't consider this the series (as I understood it to be), and it hardly constitutes a ""volume,"" though in its misleading manner it could be labeled as such.  However, I feel that the way it's done is blatantly misleading and possibly false advertising.

Furthermore I do not believe I received a new copy, but a copy that was returned for this very same reason.  I make this statement because the disks were open and not sealed as is typical of new products. If I could return this product I would do so, unfortunately I am stationed overseas in a location with difficult mail service and returning products via mail is not an option due to the limitations imposed by post.  Additionally, I bought this so my daughter could watch it. However, had it been noted that this was only essentially 5-6 episodes, I would not have purchased this product but would have waited until a more comprehensive ""volume"" when available.  This misleading labeling is primarily why the product is getting a low rating.  The material is classic, with no updating nor has any digital remastering been noted yet.

Essentially I feel as if I've been cheated, the price is too high for the ""quality"" of the product and for the limited number of episodes.  Though I note now that it says ""Premiere Episodes from each of the first 5 seasons, completely restored.""  This was not clearly disclosed, if it was noted at all, when I first purchased this product, but I see now that it has been added after numerous complaints.",1338595200,10,1905,4.687687687687688

I was aware when I purchased it that it contained only the first episode of each of the first few seasons, but I hadn't realized that the first episodes all treated of basically the same numbers and letters each year. Thus it was useless for teaching young children anything more than those few characters. Without the continuity of building upon known material, they could not teach my grandchild much of value.

Yes, I know: it was recommended for adults, not children, but I loved the old-school Sesame Street and wanted my German-reared granddaughter to have the same wonderful experiences as her mother had. I can't stand that stupid little Elmo and all the frenetic activity of the latter years. Anybody can speak in a cutesy, squeaky voice; what was so charming about the early characters was how much they sounded like the people in your neighborhood--so real--yet they were full of whimsy.

I'm so sad that they haven't released the first season in its entirety. In fact, it makes me angry. Sesame Street is funded by our taxes and contributions; it seems to me that we ought to be able to order some of the episodes we paid for.",1311465600,4,1284,4.697777777777778

As for the material in the collection...  I've been trying and trying to get my 3 yr. old son to begin recognizing his English alphabet.  After seeing just TWO of these programs, he now recognizes (and we have to look for) the letter that begins his name!  He's also recognizing letters that begin his friends' names as well.  He's now on his way to reading!  He's also doing much much better counting to 20.  Just as these programs taught ME back in the day, they are now teaching my son.  There's also a fun film on disc 2 of a Trenton fire station & firemen (his current career goal).

I really don't understand ""material not suited for today's preschoolers.""  These programs WORK.  There's now too much marketing of stuff with the current characters emblazoned on product.  I do not want my son to be advertising-driven.  I want him THINKING.  These programs have started his English letter recognition, as they did with me.

2629354,4,B000H6SY8C,"I watched sesame street in the late 80's, so what I got was different that what I remembered. I genuinely enjoyed about 50% of the material, I thought 25% was okay, and the last 25% I thought was rather annoying. In the first disc, there's about 5 minutes of a visit to the zoo that was terrible. The camera was shaking around, zoomed in WAY too far, and the lighting was terrible. However, you can only watch the highlights for each episode, and that's what I'd recommend, because that way you miss all of the rather boring and extremely outdated material.",1280707200,,557,4.524752475247524
2629355,3,B000H6SY8C,"If you're looking for something to entertain today's preschoolers, keep in mind that this set is going to be a bit rough...Sesame Street was still developing its programming and evaluating its effectiveness. And it was the first of its kind.

Example: I have to bypass one scene where an ""employment agency"" worker is consulting with a huge set of teeth to find the teeth work - the teeth wind up biting the worker and it actually looks pretty realistic, even without blood, because the worker's hair is mussed and he falls out of his chair and ""under"" the teeth behind its desk. My daughter burst into tears the first time she saw the teeth ""bite"" the man, and I've bypassed it ever since then.

It's a treat to watch with my preschoolers, but they are sometimes bored during what seem (to them) overly long intervals between the actors or puppets. However, I much prefer them watching this content than today's very long animated segments of Sesame Street on PBS with no puppets at all, just their animations. I'm especially happy to see the ""One of these things doesn't belong"" segments.

If you can sit beside your little ones while they watch this, the content is worth it to keep them engaged. Several ""interludes"" or cartoony intermissions are overly long for this age group, so I wind up fast-fowarding the last third of those if they're not important learning tools and simply for ""entertainment"" value. As Sesame Street progressed, those intervals decreased in length to better keep their audiences attentive.

What a talented, gifted set of talent on these originals! Love seeing them again as I remember them from my own youth. I doubly appreciate them now for my preschoolers and my adult eyes.",1279670400,4,1707,4.815699658703072
2629366,5,B000H6SY8C,"First let me start by saying Amazon delivered my stuff in a timely fashion. In fact it was earlier than I expected. Kudos to Amazon.

As for the DVD, it was awesome. Yes, there are a couple of repeats, but not many. I love the option to watch the highlights of each program without having to watch the whole episode. There are five full episodes (one from each season),included in the set, but there are a bunch of bonus skits from other episodes that were not included. I liked being able to choose which skits I wanted to watch, so I could go back to those ones anytime I wanted. It included all my favorite educational song skits, and a few skits I had forgotten, as well as my favorite muppet/human interactions. It was great to see Bob, Gordon (albeit more than 1), Susan, Maria, Luis, David and  Mr Hooper in their earlier years. Loved it.",1278028800,2,845,4.410256410256411
2629367,5,B000H6SY8C,"Sesame Street has served as proof that America hasn't been working hard enough at abolishing 'racism.' I am a forty-four year old black/Hispanic woman, and in all of my consciencious years of life, Sesame Street is the only program that I have never not once spotted racism within. It has always promoted mutual respect, love , and acceptance among all races of people. As a child, never not once, did I have to endure the painful humiliation of having the only 'dark' cartoon charactor speak with the dialect of a 1850's slave, and behave in a manner that is obviously intellectually inferior to the others, while entrusted into Jim Hansen's hands. So it's no wonder that I'd only consider the Sesame Street collection for my two toddler grandsons.

We love the old school sesame street.  it teaches diversity, sharing, counting,the alphabet, and other things (like where milk comes from) wonderfully!  I constantly hear my son giggling when this is on.  (kermit the frog fighting the letter W was hysterical!)

I hope other mothers make the switch back to these epsiodes, and let sesame street know, we don't like its new ""formula"" for kids shows.

2629371,4,B000H6SY8C,"My two year old became bored with the current Sesame Street Narrative. He loved Elmo for about 8 months but now is no longer interested.

However, He has been enthralled by the old school because the short and creative segments are trippy, and funny. Kermit, guy smiley, lots of bert and ernie and grover segments.

Also it seems there are no muppet characters on the current S.S. that are above 6 years old. Kermit was a perfect ""adult"" foil and interviewer.

Elmo must be a lobotomized munchkin. I thought Sesame used to be great. Has my memory cheated me?"",rest assured,it hasn't. The two volumes of these compilation 'old school' prove that the Sesame Street that Generation Xers grew up with in the seventies and early 80s was responsible for some of the most inventive,funny,creative,hummable television ever created while still teaching kids the three 'r's. How poor our generation would have been if Jim Henson,God Rest His Soul,had given up on a career in puppetry and gone back to accounting school.
The key to Sesame's success as a learning aid was to copy the slick,colourful,humourous style of television advertising,and like the ads,use constant repetition of these vignettes to drive the message home. These small films gave rise to a wealth of creativity,with many artists drawn from all sorts of independant art styles employed to present numeracy and literacy in a catchy,entertaining way. Attention to the values of decency,equality and tolerence also lifted SS above the norm and made it a genuinely revolutionary cultural artefact of its time.
Sesame's brand of infectious humour and singable ditties had a way of permanently lodging into your heart and mind. I'm 42 and I can still hum my old favorites: the Pinball-inspired,'1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ...'song,the 'Ladybug's Picnic'(complete with jokes about fire insurance!),'C is for Cookie','Rubber Duck' etc. Enormous fun and proof that the messages really took. Thankfully,all the best ones you remember are likely to be included on either one of the two volumes.
Yes,some of the info has dated,and there IS an advisory warning on the dvd that not all of the material may be suitable for modern tots.(For example,not sure I would let an under-6 catch public transport or go to the store by herself in these troubled times.)But as long as you watch WITH your toddler to act as a filter for the material(or fastforward thru' the handful of skits out of sync with modern attitudes)this is a great DVD you can genuinely ENJOY(not just watch) together. My 3 yr old niece,who rejects noughties-period SS as 'howwible') LOVES old school Sesame Street.
And if you don't crack a smile during the 'Rapunzel' skit(""Horsey??? Where's my horsey???"") you are officially dead.
It's a shame that modern Sesame lacks the verve and spirit of adventure of the show in its early incarnation. But thanks to dvd,we can now relive the show's glory days. If I believed in occultism,I'd try to bring Mr Henson back & get him to fix where it all went wrong. Starting with a firing squad for Elmo,the annoying little twerp.

However, all you get is five, i.e. one single episode from each of the first five seasons. They're great episodes, but what a chintzy offering. There were several segments that have been stuck in my head for almost 40 years now, and I was so looking forward to seeing them again... but they're not here. e.g. the Pointer Sisters counting to 12 to the animation of the surreal pinball machine, the haunting Vivaldi piece over the water droplets trickling down a flower, the little red rubber ball travelling through the Rube Goldberg style machine that counts ""1, 2, 3"" over and over ends up getting ground up into powder... Hopefully some of these are in vol. 2. On the other hand, I had completely forgotten about ""I In the Sky"" and counting to 20 to Indian sitar music and lysergic animation... seeing and hearing those again was a great surprise that really made my day.",1238371200,10,1051,4.536842105263158

Grover says, ""Y is for You, and you visit Sesame Street every day!"" Big Bird admits, ""And Z... well, Z is for... You know, I don't think there's anybody on Sesame Street whose name begins with Z! Oh, well. Can't have everything!"" This problem that Big Bird describes is finally solved in 1993, with the introduction of a character whose name begins with Z.

Bert says that everybody loves watching his favorite TV show, The Wonderful World of Pigeons. Ernie says, ""You know what, Bert? I hate that show! It's a terrible show! That's a dull show, Bert!"" Bert counters, ""That's the most exciting show on TV! They have all the pigeons of the world on that show! Gray ones... speckled ones...""

2629390,5,B000H6SY8C,My kids enjoyed this item as will as the second volume. It's great and fun to watch for the whole family,1237334400,,104,4.0
2629391,1,B000H6SY8C,"I thought I had read the description on this thoroughly enough but apparently not. I didn't realize that there were only FIVE episodes in the whole thing. It seemed like this would be really amazing for my one and a half year old. Yes, she did enjoy the first episode but after I realized that it only had a couple more I decided I'm going to return it. I would never pay over $5 PER episode of anything!! Of course, yes, there is extra material on it but not like my 1 year old is really going to care about that! I suppose if you just like to collect things like this and don't just want a good compilation of sesame street than this would be fine.",1236729600,13,650,4.125984251968504
2629392,5,B000H6SY8C,"A few weeks ago, I rented the documentary ""The World According to Sesame Street"". I had caught bits and pieces of the show on PBS every now and then, but never really saw the whole thing. Thoroughly enjoyed the video and it prompted me to visit Amazon to see if it was available for purchase and to check out what else was available on the subject. Didn't find the DVD, but I did find the book - ""Street Gang: The Complete History of Sesame Street"" so I ordered it. I also ordered this DVD set ""Sesame Street - Old School, Vol. 1 (1969-1974)"" to watch as a companion to the book. It was a great decision, many of the early first year videos discussed in the book are in the set, as well as the original sales pitch film. I recommend both the book and the video set.",1235692800,,765,4.175675675675675
2629393,5,B000H6SY8C,"I was compelled to write and add my 2 cents after reading about the ""disclaimer"" -- ""warning"" that Old School may not be appropriate for today's children.  Excuse me??  It seems that most of us grew up on Sesame Street and turned out just fine, thank you!  There is absolutely no comparison between the episodes on Old School and the nonsense they show today.  My son is almost 3 and he refuses to watch the episodes that are on TV today, but every day he brings me the Old School DVD and asks to watch it.  That's ""Good Enough for ME!!!!""",1232668800,3,539,4.297029702970297
2629394,1,B000H6SY8C,"I was so looking forward to sharing this DVD with my four year old grand daughter. You know, down memory lane and all of that.  Well, I guess Sesame Street has also helped speed up the world.  My little one lasted about five minutes before announcing ""let's do something else."" The packaging itself does advise the shows will work for grown-ups.  There you have it. The right audience for these DVDs.",1231286400,7,400,4.605633802816901
2629395,4,B000H6SY8C,Its a good DVD. Funny to look back at the first episode never knew in the first sesame street Oscar the groch was ORANGE! Yes he was ORANGE! My 11 month old loves sesame street but didn't care for the old school episodes. Its more for us Adults who grew up watching Sesame Street and looking back at the old animation and characters. In my daughters case she didn't care for it. But it was fun to look back!!,1229731200,,408,4.177215189873418
2629406,5,B000H6SY8C,"Outstanding!!!

Just what I needed  a quick and funny memory overload of warm fuzzies!
The kid even loved it!",1229472000,,109,4.684210526315789
2629407,4,B000H6SY8C,"Actually, the title for my review pretty much says it all.

Of minimal consequence:
I don't mind the video quality and neither does my 2-year-old.
I plan on getting Volume 2.
I love the opening music/singing.
I wish they'd release all of the episodes from 1969 to 1974 - they need to not underestimate how much the general consumer is willing to pay (even in these economic times) for good TV.",1229385600,,393,4.535211267605634
2629408,5,B000H6SY8C,"I rented it first because I saw some bad reviews and I was skeptical. My kids love it, from my one year old twins right up to my 14 year old son. The older kids were mesmerized at how different some of the characters looked and they thought it was very entertaining, where as normally they find Sesame Street boring. The best part about it was that there was a ton of Burt and Ernie - my favorites and a big hit with all my kids too. It's too bad they don't use them very often now, it's all Elmo - snooze. The old Sesame Street is absolutely  better. I hope they make more.",1228780800,,574,4.035087719298246
2629409,5,B000H6SY8C,"I'm from Germany. In 1969, we moved to California for two years. I was 4 years old. Sesame Street taught me almost everything and I loved the show. When we had to return to Germany, my mom taped the sound of Sesame Street with a tiny cassette player held in front of the TV. (There is a cute tape with baby brother going ""monster boo"" in the background to a Hairy Monster sketch). The tapes were for keeping my English alive, and for memories. In Germany, I watched the German Sesamstrasse once, found no Susan, Gordon, Bob, or Mr. Hooper, and boycotted it ever since. Recently, I have been watching all the clips on YouTube, singing along (I remember all the words, too) Then I boldly ordered the DVD, not knowing if the shipment to Germany would work. It did. In no more than a week it arrived. Nobody can imagine how happy it made me to watch all those beautiful stories again. I sang along with Ernie and Kermit, almost flipped out when the Jazzy Spies came (oh the wonderful music of that time), cried out hilariously at the hair-dos and clothes. Hell, it made me homesick all over again, but it was worth every minute. The bonus material is enlightening, the booklet is very informative - the CTW really did good work, then and now. It is possible children of today find it too slow (the world has gotten too hectic, anyway). These classic DVDs are more for the children of the sixties. Buy it. Wallow in memories. Become young again. Enjoy and sing along. It makes you happy and high, no side effects.
One advice: don't do any housework like ironing while watching. Believe me, shirts are hard to see with tears in your eyes ...",1220486400,3,1635,4.471571906354515
2629410,5,B000H6SY8C,"Though some sources claim that these ""old school"" children's television programs are not as useful or relevant for today's youngsters as when today's parents were originally watching (including a disclaimer in this product itself), I can relate that my 2-and-1/2-year-old is fascinated by them and she has been watching the episodes repeatedly for the past month since we started showing them to her.  So fear not - the children of the 2000s will find much to love and come back to in this package of vintage shows.  I doubt you will be sorry that you bought it for your child, especially if you loved Sesame Street when you were your child's age.",1218326400,4,647,4.767857142857143
2629411,5,B000H6SY8C,"This DVD set is packed with classic skits that I remember as a kid.  It makes me so happy to watch it with my 18 month old son and 6 month old daughter.  I know they love it just as much as I do.  My son does not like the new sesame street nearly as much.  If the new shows are on, he will actuallay bring me the dvd, because he want's to watch the classics instead!
Sorry Elmo!",1213315200,4,378,3.7468354430379747
2629412,5,B000H6SY8C,"I watched Sesame Street from the time I was really small and I always liked it. In fact, I can remember watching well past the ""target age"" of the show. However, in the last 14 years or so, I had become extremely disapointed with how much the show had been dumbed down, and the advent of a few new characters (especially Baby Bear) really messed things up. Baby Bear has the most annoying, whiny voice ever! While reading the reviews on here, I noted that several people had mentioned a speech impediment. The odd thing is that I'd never really noticed that, or cared. It was just his whole attitude that drove me up the wall. We don't having ""streaming"" TV (aka cable or sattelite) so my children haven't been growing up watching this as I did for which I am profoundly grateful. The show centering around Elmo is nothing like the show I remember and the few times my kids have seen it, they've wandered off within a few minutes! And they're all between 2 and 6. So I have few Sesame Street vids and they're rarely watched.

However, that being said, I was ecstatic when I discovered this at a friends house and got to borrow it. I hauled it home and prepared for a nice nostalgic journey (even if said episodes were aired over the decade before I was born), with the hopes that the kids would enjoy it as much as I. They loved it. They beg to watch it, and considering they know we only watch TV on the weekends, they don't usually ask. I also noted that several people mentioned the grainy quality and that their children wouldn't even watch it because of that. My children haven't had a problem with it, and have never mentioned it. Then again, that may be because we watch lots of old movies, including really old movies from the 30's (I mean, come on, what modern child actually likes watching the Marx Brothers? [besides mine that is]), so that may be a reason that they haven't noticed the quality. They've learned how to get around that aspect and enjoy the show for itself.

I too was a little disappointed at first when I found out there were only one episode from each season, but I quickly got over it. I enjoyed seeing how it evolved over those years (an orange Oscar?!) and I also really liked the little out takes. I was excited to see the little video of the boy fishing for the alphabet. That's one that's always stuck with me, and reminds me of my oldest now. If ever a whole collection is offered, it would be well worth it and I hope someday to be able to add it to our rather extensive collection. This is one of those rare instances where I would make an exception to the ""NO TV"" rule during the week.",1213056000,2,2624,4.353061224489796
2629413,3,B000H6SY8C,"We enjoyed the nostalgia, however, expected more episodes. It's dated but still wholesome entertainment for our child.",1211155200,,118,6.0
2629414,5,B000H6SY8C,"Like most Americans of my age, I grew up watching Sesame Street. It was considered a new invention to give children some rudimentary education and teach them something about the world while they moppeted and gamboled around the house doing kids stuff. Looking back at these videos, most of which I remembered very clearly when I watched them again as an adult, I wonder what these people did to my mind.
Sesame Street is now an obvious product of the counter culture. Watching some of the shorts and cartoons in it ... well, I can see why teenage pot-smoking reprobates enjoyed watching Sesame Street as much as kids in those days did. Heck, there were many, many prominent members of the counter culture featured prominently in the program. For example, I had a crush on Buffy St. Marie, American Indian Movement activist from the 60s, from listening to her sing nice songs on Sesame Street. I also had quite a few Stevie Wonder records because of his numerous appearances on Sesame Street. Other figures of the time also made occasional appearances; Johnny Cash and Jesse Jackson among others.
It's funny watching the kids from Sesame Street (which, in case you don't remember, is in the Ghetto) gamboling around Farmer Bob's Farm, figuring out where food comes from and such. One of the great cultural artifacts preserved in Sesame Street, besides the psychedelic art and the hipster haircuts and moustaches, is the uniforms that this era of working class people wear. I mean, I remember people dressing like that, but if they weren't anthropologically preserved in the Bell Jar of Sesame Street ... that might have been lost to history. Nobody knows how Scythian bartenders dressed and comported themselves either. Watching the series really brings me back; it also reminded me of Mr. Hooper who was probably my favorite old dude on Television, and that the ""old school"" cookie monster is actually pretty scary.

Is it good for kids? I think it is. If you're the type who wants your kid to wear a bicycle helmet when he walks around the house, you'll probably be horrified by it. I find it entertaining, educational, and profoundly nice.  Sesame Street Old School also lacks any of the shrill sanctimony or paranoid preachiness that you see in modern kids shows. Kids can watch it and hardly know they're being taught stuff at all. I occasionally wonder that they didn't implant secret mind control engrams into my mind with some of those wacky psychedelic scenes, a la Manchurian Candidate, but over all this is great nostalgic fun.",1210809600,12,2537,4.87037037037037

I also wish that the viewer warning, These are not intended for young children, but rather for the parents to enjoy, was listed in the seller description.",1207440000,,441,4.365853658536586

I did not know that prior to buying it, but when my three year old daughter had no interest in watching it, I decided to see why.  Once I started to watch the video with her, the narrator came on and said that this product was for adults and would not appeal to today's pre-school age children. He was right and that could be because the children of today are over stimulated and Old School Sesame Street does not stimulate them.  If you have fond memories of waching the Sesame Street characters of old, and believe your children will too, let me warn you that they will not and you will be wasting your money on nostalgia.",1207353600,2,675,4.384
2629431,3,B000H6SY8C,"This volume is very different; since Oscar the Grouch is orange in the beginning of the television show...normally he's green. The introductary segments are very new to me, since they don't show kids running, playing in the structures or ridding on a animal.

Though Burt is very controlling.

They say at the begining that it may not be suitable for ""today's preschoolers"".

Gordon (an adult) does show the new girl around and then his wife Susan invites her in for milk and cookies.

Also the 70's Zoo scenes are kinda depressing.

And the kids also spend some of the time playing at an abandon construction site.

So I guess you should use it as entertainment and not life-example.

Still it was always on in my house, thanks to two younger brothers. This is the first collection of the orginal epsiodes and for the most part its a treat. Here are the episodes pretty much as they played on TV originally. Wonderful.
If I could quibble I wish the set contained more. While I know economically it would be impossible to release a whole hundred plus episode season (it would be at least 30 DVDs) I wish the set had included more full episodes. Not that what they have included is bad, its not, but five is not enough. Like wise I would have liked more clips. There were so many wonderful pieces I don't see why we couldn't have had more. I know its kind of ridiculous to  want more since between this and the second set so many great bits are included, but at the same time so much of this show has become part of my psyche (You wouldn't believe how much I sang and spoke along even after almost 40 years).

2629451,5,B000H6SY8C,"I just watched the first Sesame Street ever with my toddler and we both LOVED it!  It's so funny and so real.  I probably started watching Sesame Street myself in... 1974 or so.  Somewhere along the way I think Sesame Street lost a lot of the things that made it so great.  It seems like over the years many classic bits that I loved as a kid were removed from the show because a nutcase in some backwater of America complained about it.  Don Music was always a favorite of mine.  Where is he?  Gone. Why? Because parents think it makes kids bang their heads on furniture.  As an educated and reasonable adult I know that my influence dwarfs that of any TV show.  My son is allowed to watch TV sparingly and mostly with an adult.  At three years old he knows that if you hit your head on the furtniture it hurts and that one shouldn't partake in that activity no matter what the frustrated puppet on TV does.

  So, with this DVD release, and (dare I hope) more in the future, I can share something from my childhood with my own child.  The first show is so funny.  It's clear that no one knew what the show was supposed to be.  There's lots of adlibs and improv (from the adults, the kids AND the puppets). It was hilarious.  When the little girl is offered a glass of milk by Gordon #1 she tells him that she likes coffee, a quip which totally breaks Gordon up and causes him to struggle to find some response.

  I don't know if the people at CTW remember the point of Sesame Street, but the idea was to provide inner city kids with educational material that they might not have access to otherwise.  The idea was to make the characters accessible by putting the characters in an inner city environment.  Sesame Street looked a little dirty and a little run down just like most streets in NYC (where I grew up).  Sometimes there were some odd characters wandering around Sesame Street just like most streets in NYC.  That was the beauty of Sesame Street.  There are people on my block who my son should look up to and respect and there are some he would do best to avoid and not emulate.  That's life.  IMHO, by removing all the characters who are a ""bad influence"", a very valuable lesson is lost.  Sesame Street has become the same as all the other sanitized kids shows where everyone does the right thing all the time and you can trust everyone to help you out.  Personally, I find that to be a very dangerous thing to teach your child.",1202256000,6,2442,4.317180616740088

My kids (4 and 7), who have never seen the current version of Sesame Street, love this. And it's interesting to me to have a grown-up's perspective on the material and methods.

I can definitely see that they've changed some things over the years, and the early shows seem to be more loosely scripted. There's less emotional sensitivity than I remember, but maybe that's just a matter of perspective.

I love seeing The King of Eight, Guy Smiley, Grover's Restaurant, Twiddlebugs Go to the Zoo, Martians Telephone, Ladybug Picnic, Bread, Milk, and Butter, etc, but I do miss the pinball counting- wish that was in there.

We actually learned from the ""Old School"" Sesame Street, not like today where the whole show is centered around a red monster who refers to himself in the third person.  What kind of nonsense are they trying to teach our kids today with that?  A wonderful set except it would have been real sweet if they had included more episodes in the set, my reason for this set not getting five stars.

Sadly, my many viewings prompted me to wonder where other skits were and why they weren't included, with the hope that a Vol 2 was really in the works and would show even more of these wonderful shows.

My one frustration is in the actual episodes and the repetitiveness of the skits.  I think D, 2, and 3 sponsor almost every episode in this set, meaning that you see some of the same skits over and over.  If that is what was in those episodes, so be it.

At the age of 36, I fall into the sweet spot of the Old School demographic, but I'm not sure why the Sesame Street Workshop (which I knew as the Children's Television Workshop) felt compelled to stick in that animated disclaimer about how little kids today wouldn't like it and that its value is strictly nostalgic.

The sales reel, starring Kermit and Rawlf (I didn't know this muppet dawgy existed in 1969!) and the geniuses who created the show and did all that test marketing with their intended audience, is, just like the actual show, both entertaining and educational.

This is a good little collection, and since its a DVD you can watch as much or as little as you want.

Picture quality on the video segments is awesome. Some of the film segments are old and scratched but the original film sources are probably lost to us at this point.

Sesame Street was a part of my daily life for MANY years, since I was born only a few months before the show began, and it makes me very happy to be able to sing ""Ladybug Picnic"" now with my three-year-old daughter. There are some segments with lots of repetition and little polish, but we are talking about a trail-blazing show in an era when many TV performances look stilted to the viewers of the present. I will certainly be getting Volume 2. Check out the Electric Company compilations for more strolling down memory lane.",1177804800,4,714,4.72
2629557,3,B000H6SY8C,"Season 1, Episode 1

 Letter is REALLY strong, big repetition within the episode, but not a big deal. Oscar was ORANGE at one time? Whoa, now I know why classic drawings of Big Bird looked funky--his head didn't get filled out till Season 2 I suppose. So Ernie and Bert live in the basement--I'd forgotten that!

Season 2, Episode 131

 This season spun up more of what I remember from my childhood! All the muppet characters have the incarnations that I remember.

Season 3, Episode 276

 More characters enter the cast. I hardly remember any of the human ones though, even when they interacted with muppets--the bit in Mr. Hooper's store with the soda is perfect: I remember Bert and Ernie, but not the others. Ah, and there's Spanish being spoken in this one.@Snuffy has funky eyes.

Season 4, Episode 406

 It's at this point that the show appears to hit stride, with improved quality all around. It also has th opening song that I remember th most clearly and really associate with the show. HEY, the letter is D, and that's my name--I love this show. Snuffy is as I remember him--I'd remembered his voice being deeper and not so whispery; oh well.

Season 5, Episode 536

 Now I'm worried, because the letter D has resurfaced! My vision of each letter of the alphabet being released is dashed.

I really like the idea of the format, with the first episode of each of the seaons provided. Each episode is preceeded by Robert, a little cartoon that leads the episodes.

It was nice seeing the songs and character skits I remember. It was fascinating to see the storylines of the episodes--I hardly remember them, which is only understanable. I also don't remember many of the live actor skits, and they were cool to see. I was surprised how strong the themes for the episodes were. It brings a smile to my face to see the multiple ethnicities without the distillery that has occurred over the years.

I imagine the next set in th series will provide all the episode 2's? Very cool. Just seeing the episode information makes me realize that it would be all but impossible to release EVERY episode...but maybe they'll try...

With all the good, I do have one complaint: I have to agree with everyone that the COST of these is a little ridiculous. $20 should be sufficient. Especially because: Some have complained that there is too much repetition. Call me crazy, but there always was repetition!(The show is ONE HOUR long! That's a lot of time to fill!)

But: If I were Sesame Street, I'd have concentrated on the alphabet for a season (assuming each season completed it), and then maybe put the rest out, sans the repeat items--just to be able to see the progression of the unique Sesame Street stuff... Still, seeing the full episodes is satisfying, and fulfills the stickler in me... It begins to be clear maybe why these weren't released before now! Tough! Still, I have the feeling that they may only release a few sets, since these ""super episodes"" have highlights from the seasons...

Some people complained about the picture quality *shrug* Deal. I don't think the picture quality at that time was very good anyway!

Would you have paid a hundred dollars for a complete season? I would have. As much as I loved this set, I will NOT buy the next. In the final reckoning, I just cannot compromise my desire for completeness. I'm happy that Sesame in the form I loved now exists, but for a time/generation of complete sets on DVD, this doesn't cut it.",1177545600,39,3459,4.637704918032787
2629558,2,B000H6SY8C,"How would you feel if the highlights of your favorite show as a child were reduced to 1 DVD per year (as Sesame Street Old School is)?  Ok, how would you feel if on this already truncated single DVD is only one full episode with about a dozen selected bits as extras?  This is what you are getting with SSOS, Vol 1.  Feeling pretty disappointed aren't you...?

The cheap skates at Public Broadcasting & Children's Television Workshop obviously think so little of their fans that this is their idea of a compilation DVD...  On the one hand, I loved the trip down memory lane and the ""1969"" episode that is included is the very first episode of Sesame Street, so it's an interesting picture into the beginnings of the show (Gordon #1, Oscar the ORANGE grouch, Big Bird who talks like he is a little demented, Mr. Hooper, and generally all the characters when they were young and exciting, unlike the more recent Sesame Street shows that are tired, rely way too much on Elmo, and don't intellectually challenge the kids).  In addition, the extra bits that included are all great, great memory refreshers.

But, and this is a BIG but, how can you release a supposed collection of DVD's that gives you so little?  One episode per year????  A dozen or so extra bits per year?????  Three of the twelve bits on 1969 are simply actors saying the alphabet.  Although it's neat to see Jackie Robinson & James Earl Jones from 37 years ago and this bit was a hallmark of Sesame Street episodes for years, it's hardly my idea of great television to watch someone speak the alphabet dead-pan (especially considering the DVD's are marketed to those of us who watched these shows as children).

These compilations held so much promise.  My only hope is that these are teaser DVD's and sometime in the future PBS/CTW will wake up and release larger collections.",1177286400,19,1843,4.633846153846154

Can't explain why--perhaps it's the obscurity of old TV shows and their more pronounced ""datedness"", which makes them particularily fascinating time-capsules.  Anyways, I doubt there will ever be season sets given the sheer amount of repetition (how many thousands of Sesame Street shows were produced?), especially of the interstitials--the animated or pre-recorded segments; hence, the spare bits are given their own ""classic cuts"" section.  For example, the ""Doll House"" bit (""One, two, two little dolls..."") appears twice on the DVD, even though the complete episodes were the premiere episodes for each of the first five seasons.

2629602,5,B000H6SY8C,"I purchased this collection as much for my three children as for myself.  I started watching Sesame Street in about 1973 and thought that it was just about the coolest thing I'd ever seen.  My mother once told me that Sesame Street was in New York City and I remember thinking that everyone in Manhattan must know Big Bird.  The Sesame Street of these DVD's is the gritty, tire-filled urban landscape that I recall--with all the adults I knew and loved and trusted (a very beautiful young Maria...a dorky but loving Bob...a cool as a cucumber David...the can-do Luis) doing what they did best--teaching children not just how to read and count, but how to cooperate, share, resolve differences, and maybe most importantly accept one another regardless of gender, color or language.  Today's Sesame is really a pale, anemic version of ""my"" brilliant Sesame, and I suspect that if this DVD sells well (which I suspect it will) the producers of the show will have to admit that somewhere, they veered away from the show's true mission--to meet the educational and psychosocial needs of preschoolers in all economic demographics.  Cue Abby Cadabby?...oh, wait.  Never mind.

That being said, what do you get on this collection? Everything you knew you loved but haven't seen in 30 years.  The 10 minute montage on the milk cycle.  The absolutely spectacular ""handclapping"" sequence (guaranteed to stick in your head for hours afterward.  As my 21-month old succinctly put it after viewing the segment for about the 30th time, ""This is fun."") Remember ""Can't you see?  There's a bird on me""?  How about when nobody could see Snuffy except for Big Bird?  Lena Horne singing to Grover?  James Earl Jones doing the alphabet?  Luis demonstrating ""exit"" using nothing but a brick wall?  Bert and Ernie at the movies?  Count von Count counting to 6 using Ernie's pyramid of blocks?  A wildlife segment on...the jackrabbit?  How about a jazzy ode to a tiger (""Who you lookin' at tiger, and what do you see?"")?  Kermit getting dissed by a little girl who thought that Cookie Monster was part of a standard recitation of the alphabet?  Could this collection be any more perfect as a representation of how television for children can and should be?

Professionally, I'm a middle-school language arts teacher and K-12 reading specialist.  I am amazed by the high level of instructional material that can be gleaned for children from just these three DVD's.  Phonemic awareness in the form of rhymes, word games, basic vowel-consonant word patterns (CVC, CVCC), concepts of print--all of these fundamental skills can be explored with emerging readers to increase their own sensitivity to the way language works.  The shows also explore a comprehensive sight word vocabulary that rivals any Dolch list.  I have to say that the newer shows just don't do as good a job in presenting basic reading concepts.  In my opinion, there's no need to reinvent the wheel here--just mix up the old reading segments (Dan the man with the golden ""an"") in with the newfangled Elmo/Zoe crowd and everybody's bound to be happy.

I cannot wait for other volumes to come out.  Will I be as eager to buy them once they lose their Henson-centricness?  Hmmmm.",1172966400,12,3217,4.9037037037037035
2629633,4,B000H6SY8C,"I snapped up this DVD set not long after I'd discovered it had been released; I am 95% above and beyond satisfied; allow me to share what constitutes my percentages:

Contributors to my 95% satisfaction:

- Being able to view Sesame Street segments I have not seen in decades

- Watching my 2 year old's eyes light up at the discovery of ""new"" monsters and characters, such as Guy Smiley and Harvey Kneeslapper

- Hearing my 2 year old recite along with the various alphabet and number segments (such as ""Madrigal Alphabet""); something she had NEVER done with the horribly sanitized, insanely predictable Sesame Street of today.

- Seeing Mr. Hooper alive and well

- Seeing all our favorites in their prime; so Gordon DID have hair once!  And why does Luis look a bit like Ray Ramone?  :)

Contributors to my 5% disappointment:

- Some retreading of segments.  I thought I was going nuts when I'd watched one episode on Monday and saw the trippy ""Daddy Dear"" segment then...the next day I watched a different episode and saw ""Daddy Dear"" again!  This happened with another animated ""D"" segment as well (the construction building having ""D"" themed floors...""dolls,"" ""dogs,"" and ""diamonds."")

Mind you, potential buyer, this repeating error only happens a handful of times amongst all 3 DVDs in the set, so take comfort in that. But shame on you, Sesame Workshop; there's certainly more than enough classic material you could have used; having repeats is absolutely unacceptable. You don't think we consumers are going to catch it, but trust us, WE DO! Sherlock Hemlock taught us all we needed to know!

- I would have loved to have seen full seasons on DVD as well, as opposed to 5 episodes.  However, I believe Sesame Workshop atoned for their sins a bit by including the classic clips in this set.

If you're a Gen X-er and grew up with Sesame Street, you will love this set and pray for more to be released.

If you are a Gen X-er with a toddler, I'm pretty darned confident that you'll be amazed at how your little one reacts to this ""new"" Sesame Street.  It doles out plenty of what the current stuff isn't: plenty of alphabet and counting, concepts like ""enter/exit,"" hysterical Bert and Ernie skits (as opposed to the bland ""Journey to Ernie"" clips of today) and the wonderful ""how-to"" segments such as ""A Stool for Me,"" ""Hamburger Bun Factory, and even an older one on how cows make milk that must have been way before my time!  So much creativity; you'll see it from the get-go and your child will, too.

A real treat for adults and children alike; highly recommended. (and I guarantee you'll have the ""Captial I"" tune in your head long after the DVD player is clicked off!)  :)",1172448000,13,2687,4.65042372881356

When I viewed the 1st disc I was only a little disappointed to see the entire 1st episode.  There were even repeats within the episode.  What I expected from the discription was a montage of excerpts from the 1st season: the whole 1st season, not just one episode.

Disc 2 was the same way:  just 2 complete episodes; there were even repeats.  And disc 3 was boring.  I fast-forwarded through most of it.

The best parts of the 3 discs were the cut-outs.

I am 'Original Sesame Streeter', meaning it is MY generation that was the demographic focus of the Educators/Writers/Producers/Artists of the Children's Television Workshop. I was exactly 5 years old when the show premiered on November 10, 1969, my fifth birthday!

Talk about hitting the bullseye!

I loved Sesame Street from day one. I even christened my home's bathtub 'Rosie' after Ernie told Bert that was their bathtub's name.

My sister put a piece of tape on the front of the bathtub by the spigot and wrote 'Rosie' on it. I'll never forget it!

I had the original cast album released in 1970, of course, and memorized all the songs, and still know them all fairly well,...memory is starting to fail me at times at age 42...ha ha!

These DVD's had me doing the 'laugh until you cry' thing.

It really brings back so many wonderful memories of a time so damn long ago. I'm starting to feel old.

We had now shows to call our own at that age. The way the shows were put together was totally perfect, as we were all so accustomed to commercial TV's fast paced short segmented stuff like cartoons and commercials.

How many of the rest of you fans of the show out there learned the basics from Sesame Street by repetition? I sure did! : )

What a joy to see all this classic old material again.

Sesame Street just isn't the same anymore. I've tried to watch it.

These were the 'golden years'.

I don't have kids, so maybe that's why I can't get into it.

2. The packaging is cheap. The outer box that holds the DVDs is flimsy and too small to hold the inner sleeves. My copy is already banged up from trying to shove the DVDs back in the box. Producers: Spend the extra 25 cents or whatever to give us a decent box.

3. There are only 5 episodes. Would love to see more from the dearly-departed muppets like Herbert Birdsfood (only 1 clip), Don Music (nothing!), Harvey Kneeslapper (nothing!), etc.

Other that that, it has been a joy to see the old episodes again. If you are looking for classic Sesame Street, this is IT!",1169942400,,844,4.651006711409396
2629695,4,B000H6SY8C,"Thanks to Sesame Workshop for releasing these CLASSIC eps of Sesame Street...I have been an ADDICT since 1973 when I was born...I was always a fan of the skits with the muppets and the live action ""Street Scenes"" more than the cartoons...I played this set for my three-year old niece and she LOVES the yellow dots segment where there's ALWAYS the one dot that turns red or is slow getting to its place...and she also loves the counting segment where the baker ALWAYS falls down the steps...she cracks up on that one.

My fav character on the show has always been Maria...she was soooo young back then!!! I believe in one of her commentaries she said she was about 20/21 when she started but looked 14 so they made her a teenager...I always thought she was SOOO cool and hip...I first learned Spanish from her...and she and David were a cute couple...I was SOOOOO shocked when she ended up with Luis....Also Susan, Gordon, and Olivia were my favs as well...I was SUPRISED to see Charlotte Rae *Mrs. Garrett on Diff'rent Strokes and the Facts of Life* was a regular in the first year or two...and I can vividly remember when Mr. Hooper died and they had to explain it to Big Bird.

Seeing these eps makes me miss the good ol days of PBS...Sesame Street today is just NOT the same...a whole half of the show for just Elmo?...While I like the character and ESP the puppeteer for Elmo...I think a half hour of just HIM is too much...and THEN to make Bert and Ernie live in separate places...that's so worng...after 30 years you gon make them live in different places all because of politics???/....who says that two men living together CAN'T be straight?..and what does any of THAT have to do with kid's telly?...CHILDREN don't naturally thik about that...they are in it for the entertainment...and if they are learning something educational it's alll good with me.  PUT BERT AND ERNIE BACK THEY WAY THEY WERE!

I hope they release more volumes soon...I was sad to see that Vol. One did not have the CLASSIC ep with Steivie Wonder on it...Not only did he sing Superstition on there...but he did a VERY GROOVY Sesame Street song...his own creation...NOTHING like the song we all know...BUT OH SO HIP!...check it out on You Tube.",1169942400,2,2222,4.660714285714286

As far as the disclaimer, I was a little surprised when I saw it. I guess it's just how times have changed. I think the ""Over, Through and Around"" is probably one of the big reasons for it.

Most of the skits and cartoons I hadn't seen in over 30 years, and I was amazed at how much I remembered.  Compared to today's Sesame Street, the ""Old School"" Sesame Street is more entertaining on many levels, and it's nice that our children can experience what we did.

The collection basically contains five full episodes (one from each of the first five seasons), numerous shorts from the first five seasons, and the original sales pitch for the show.  The sales pitch (which I assume was aimed at television stations) is interesting for adults but would probably not interest most children.  It does feature Kermit, Rawlph the dog, and other muppets, but for the most part, their discussions are all business.  Also interesting from a historical perspective is the very first episode of Sesame Street.  They hadn't quite worked out all of the kinks yet; for example, they go a little too far with the repetition.

I think putting out this material is a great idea that should have been done a long time ago. I only wish they had put out more than one episode from each season.",1168992000,,1174,4.748768472906404

I remember having a black and white tv and at that time didn't know how those muppets looked like in colour. And to see it again, now, in colour made me feel so nostalgic for the good old days. They really did a good job with the colours on the dvd especially in scenes shot in the studio. It looked like it was shot yesterday if not for the bell bottoms. By the way, Oscar the grouch was originally orange in colour and not green (go figure) and Big Bird's head looks a lot smaller then. Triva - I remember seeing a bald guy reading out the A,B,Cs in that booming voice. I didn't know who it was then but boy does he look familiar now..... it was a very young James Earl Jones pre Darth Vader. Did I mention he was totally bald ? You've got to see it to believe it. The songs and sketches are as entertaining now as it was way back then. There is also a little booklet which comes with the dvd telling you what events took place in the world while the shows were being aired. Very cool. Kids now will know what events happened in 1969 or 1970 while Sesame Street was on. Anyhoos... I enjoyed it tremendously and will look out for volume 2. Trust me when I say that Sesame Street is one to be enjoyed by the whole family and not only for the kids. There are more gems in the special features as you'll soon see when you get this dvd.

Sesame Street, the earliest years,had a lot to do with the success my kids enjoyed throughout their educational experience.  I should mention that one is an Assistant District Attorney in California, another runs a State Funded pre-school, and the other ""child"" is a CPA and CFO for a company in San Diego. Viewing these videos reaquainted us with some valuable old friends who taught us priceless lessons, not only about education but life as well. In conclusion I would like to say that as an educator myself, 40 plus years in front of a classroom, I still hold Sesame Street and the creators of it directly responsible for all of our education about the important things in life. I think it was one of the greatest learning aids of any century.

2629877,5,B000H6SY8C,"I'm going to just go ahead and get the ""I grew up with Sesame Street / The new stuff doesn't compare / And the other recent DVDs suck / This is awesome"" out of the way first -- clearly that's all true.

This set is very good, but there's a few things that could be better. The individual episodes aren't divided into chapters by segment, but rather each chapter is set to start at arbitrary parts deemed ""highlights"". This makes it hard to browse through an episode.

Additionally, I'm not sure the first-episode-of-each-season approach was necessarily the best. Each of these spends more ""welcome to sesame street"" time than I remember the average episode doing, and it's likely that of the other episodes to choose from each season, there would have been some even better material. (The fourth season premiere with the gigantic cardboard robot is particularly weak and annoying.)

And, be aware that although the packaging and the description above on Amazon reference the Pinball Number Count animation, that didn't actually debut on Sesame Street until 1977, and so isn't included in this set. Presumably given the level of interest it will be a centerpiece on Sesame Street Old School, Vol. 2.",1167782400,6,1198,4.891625615763547
2629878,5,B000H6SY8C,"I snapped up this collection when I saw a recent review of it in an entertainment magazine.  I had been thinking for years how much the newer Sesame Street episodes differed from the ones I grew up with and longed to see those old animated counting segments, the baker falling down the stairs with his pastries, and nowadays-seldom-seen Muppets like Herry Monster.  What a treat to see entire old episodes, plus a string of ""greatest hits"" segments featuring classic songs like C is for Cookie and Rubber Ducky.  I absolutely loved it.  As an adult the didactic qualities jumped out more, but were seamless to me as a kid. I loved the late 60s/early 70s look and feel as well.  Some things I did not remember--an orange Oscar the Grouch?? --but others I immediately recognized even when I hadn't thought of them in 30 years, like the series of animations of dots marching across the screen, and then messing up in certain ways (turning the wrong color etc) and going back and re-doing it. Of the extras, the one I most enjoyed is the original ""pitch reel"" used to sell the Sesame Street concept.  The first bit with Joan Ganz Cooney speaking flatly to the camera and explaining the educational theory of the show is a huge yawner, but when it switches to Kermit the Frog and Rowlf explaining how the show will operate, complete with sample bits, classic Muppet humor shines through even in this very early example of Henson's work.  Neat!

So I pretty much knew I would love it.  All the neice-and-nephew family units received a set for Christmas and I have been holding my breath a little, figuring that even if the kids of today found it boring, their parents would get a kick out of the same memory lane trip that I did...but so far the kids seem to like it a lot too!  Very cool, and something that my brother said he'll be far happier to watch with the kids than something like Barney or the Wiggles.  So if you want to see if your kids will like old-school style Sesame, give it a go--unless they MUST have Elmo or nothing, because the little orange guy is no where to be found in this set (and some of us like it that way!)",1167609600,,2130,4.4498714652956295

2629911,4,B000H6SY8C,"While I am pleased that full-length episodes of classic Sesame Street have made the rounds to DVD, be warned that they are not entirely unedited.  For example, a film segment in the very first show about getting clean with water was replaced with something else, it didn't have anything to do with a naked female child taking a shower in a bathtub opening and closing the film segment as it had to do with the background music used, performed by The Swingle Singers.  The 2006 copyright update notice during the funding credits of each episode also bothered me, especially on the episodes where it was plastered over the original copyright messages of Children's Television Workshop.  Wouldn't the 2006 copyright update notice being printed on the DVD packaging have been enough?  My other turn-off was where the original logos for NET and PBS on the first and second season premieres were cut out, with the classic 1971 PBS I.D. logo bumper appearing in place of them, as though those two earlier I.D. logos never existed!  What a disgrace!  Yet the program closings were still exciting with that I.D. logo in their place.  The same goes for the ""funky chimes music"" during the sponsor credits which was first used on the fourth season premiere in November 1972.

For those of you not familiar with the I.D. logos that preceded the PBS I.D. that came into being the same year as I did; 1971, here is a brief description of them.  At the end of the series premiere after the funding credits, a red vertical stripe at the left side of the screen would come down, followed by a yellow vertical stripe going upward next to it, then a blue vertical stripe going down next to that, all accompanied by a synthesizer jingle penned by Eric Siday, and an announcer's voice, ""This is NET, the Public Television network.""  The three vertical lines morphed into the letters N E T while all of that went on, with a blue horizontal line drawn over them, which formed the house roof with the antenna on top, connected to the T.

For the second season premiere, the very first PBS I.D. was used, which was just a still image of the words Public Broadcasting Service in a center-justified text stack with red, yellow and blue colors in a Helvetica typeface, accompanied just by the voice of actor MacDonald Carey (Dr. Tom Horton on Days of Our Lives, whose voice still does the opening narration of the soap opera) announcing ""This is PBS, the Public Broadcasting Service."" Like the NET one before it and the PBS one that came after it, this logo had a black background.

It was also criminal that the song Stevie Wonder performed on the show for the fourth or fifth season premiere; ""1-2-3 Sesame Street,"" and his hit ""Superstition"" had to be clipped out as well as the Anything Muppets singing with Gordon ""Consider Yourself"" from the ""Oliver"" musical in the first episode.  The things that have to be taken out for fear of others getting lawyer happy!  Still, what we're consciously spoon-fed is better than nothing at all.

2629912,5,B000H6SY8C,"Heres the thing. The disclaimer on this package is a bunch of crap. There may be something I'm missing that the experts aren't, but I find that out of the whole Sesame Street vaults (40 years almost), some of the best material for kids still lays in the first five seasons. I won't knock the modern Street thats on TV these days, because no doubt its still the best show for little kids, but I COMPLETELY recommend this collection if you have preschoolers- or even younger, there is absolute magic in the original seasons, that brings you and your kids together like no TV show could, can, or ever will. Thats why a good poertion of bits found here, still surface from time to time on the modern show, and other DVD releases. I of course needed the most I could dig up.
The shows are from the late sixties and early seventies, so they ain't exactly up on the modern trends- the graffiti on the walls of flowers and moons has been long washed away- but the whole milk style of teaching should be considered absolutely timeless.... whats so dated about the live short nature films of giraffes and hippos doing their thing? My two year old digs it. Very soothing when you try to chill out your little hellraiser.
When I was a kid in the early eighties, I grew up on a different sort of Street, but most of the show that I watched was built on these bits from the first seasons. In fact I could reminisce on a lot more of this package than I even expected to.. but regardless I love the whole thing, deeply. Even episode one, where Big Bird is autistic, and Oscar the Grouch is orange... this show exuberated brilliance from day one. No doubt it changed the world, and you can see why. This is the stuff that apparently has been researched more than any thing else by boards who specialize in child education- not to mention, commercial television, maybe it can't be expalained, but it no doubt does its job well, by entertaining on the conscious level, and subconsciously tricking your kids (and your kids parents too) into learning a great deal more than they hardly ever even realize.
Plus Kermit the Frog is like a hipster, man. Groovy.",1163980800,4,2136,4.47948717948718

Sure some of its dated, but what a perfect opportunity to talk to your kids about history,culture, and all sorts of things.

I really loved this DVD. It brought back many happy memories of watching the show and I was surprised as to how many skits I remembered.

This is a definate Muppet must -have,along with the Muppet Show,Christmas Eve on Sesame Street,Muppet Family Christmas, and the first three Muppet movies.",1163721600,13,695,4.783333333333333
2629914,5,B000H6SY8C,"In the evenings my young son and I sit down to eat dinner in front of the TV set (yes, I know it's bad parenting to plop a kid in front of a TV at mealtime) and usually ""Sesame Street"" is what we are watching. Like most pre-schoolers, he enjoys the Muppet characters, the humorous plotlines and hopefully he's getting something educational out of it. But as 42 year old Dad, who was a child of the '60s and has sweet rose colored, nostalgic memories of growing up in the '70s, it just seems like something is missing from what I remember. Now, I don't want to bash the current show. For my money it's still the best educational programming for Pre-schoolers on the tube today. But had I outgrown it? Or is the Elmo/Mr. Noodle version of the show, somehow different?

Well, recently I got my answer, when I gave my son the newly released DVD boxset, ""Sesame Street, Old School (1969-1974)"" for his fifth birthday. (O.K., who am kidding? I was actually buying it for myself.) Once, I put these discs on and the opening credits started, it was like a powerful wave of nostalgia ran over me. I instantly started singing the bouncey, unforgettable theme song and as the show's opening rolled by, I started recognizing the mostly urban, kids (and the seal) that had been indelibly etched in my mind (my favorite is the pensive little girl on the tricycle).

Watching these early episodes on disc makes me realize just how how revolutionary, energetic, imaginative and well written this show really was in it's early years. I love the amazing animation segments, that taught numbers and the alphabet with humor and just a touch of pychedelia. Early versions of the Muppet characters are there, including Big Bird (with a smaller head), Bert & Ernie, Oscar the Grouch (he's Orange!) and of course Kermit the Frog (this amazed my son, who only knew the green one through movies and ""The Muppet Show"" DVDs). The original multi-ethnic, friendly cast of humans are also all there, which included Gordon, Susan, Bob, Mr. Hooper, Luis and more. I love the ideal of hanging out with these folks!

The shows are a treasure trove of '70s nostalgia. I love looking at the clothes including bell bottoms, flower shirts with huge collars and mini skirts. The actors (including the kids) all have either Vietnam-era long hair or those far-out afros. I also love the show's soundtrack, which makes ample use of both Jazz and '70s style Funk. Also, throughout the episodes are cameos from younger versions of Carol Burnett, Bill Cosby, Jackie Robinson, Lena Horne, James Earl Jones and the late, Johnny Cash.

The DVD boxset is made up of three discs, which contain the season premieres of the first 5 seasons. It interesting to see the show evolving and becoming more polished as time goes by. Also included are 45 bonus segments (including my favorite tunes ""Rubber Duckie"" and ""Being Green""). The extras also include the original ""pitch reel"" use to sell the show to broadcasters. The DVD picture & sound mastering is well done. I've seen a number of videotaped shows from that era, now appearing on DVD, that don't look half as good.

If I had but one complaint, it's about a warning thats put on the first disc, which says ""these early Sesame Street episodes are intended for grownups and may not suit the needs of today's preschool children"". Where did they get that from? My preschooler was absolutely engrossed in these episodes. He smiled and laughed as he counted and read along with the segments. One farm episode in particular got the two of us into a long conversation about milking cows (hey, its important to a 5 year old!).

This really is wonderful DVD boxset, which chronicles the early years of a show, that revolutionized children's television. It is both fun and entertaining. Hopefully, the fact, that there is a Volume 1 on the box means there is more to come! I highly recomend it for both nostalgic adults and their young children. Don't wait, just buy it!",1163721600,26,3958,4.71242774566474
2629915,5,B000H6SY8C,"Rather than go with the traditional ""box set-by-season"" release schedule, the producers have taken the far more digestible and appealing approach of selecting highlight episodes from the show's first five seasons. This makes for a wonderful viewing experience for 30-somethings feeling nostalgic for their childhoods. To be honest, most people wouldn't want to sit through an entire season's worth, anyway. The ""greatest hits""/""classic clips"" approach is far more palatable.

While the Muppets are undeniably cute, this is a package that is squarely aimed at adults. There is an interesting disclaimer in the booklet as well as an animated introduction on disc 1 that explains how teaching methods have changed dramatically in the last 30 years, and that some components and ideas are no longer necessarily suitable for today's young audiences to watch on their own. For example, in the first episode, Gordon is walking alone with one of his newly-arrived young students after school and giving her a tour of Sesame Street. His wife invites the little girl to come over later for milk and cookies, and she accepts immediately. Her parents are nowhere to be seen, and are never consulted. In another episode, a little lost girl uses a dime to call home for help, but a well-meaning SuperGrover forcibly carries her away, ostensibly to save her mom the trip. And of course, there's the issue of the grownups not believing Big Bird even though he's telling the truth about the Snuffleupagus.

Disc 1 also contains the original 30 minute pitch reel that the Children's Television Workshop designed for Public Broadcasting Stations to consider the show. Introduced by CTW founding member Joyce Ganz Cooney, the reel features Rowlf the Dog explaining the show concept (creating ""commercials"" for letters and numbers) to Kermit by showing test clips and footage of development meetings. It's absolutely fascinating (and genuinely heart-warming) to see the people involved in pioneering what was an exciting and new learning medium. You see footage of a cartoon (""The Letter J"") being pitched, developed, animated, recorded, and tested on kids. It's a remarkable process that makes you appreciate the hard work and true heart that goes into creating something positive for children. The footage interspersed with Muppet ""producers"" trying to come up with a name for this wonderful new show...

There are five episodes spread across three discs, one from each year between 1969-1974 (including the pilot). Each episode can be viewed as originally broadcast, or you can jump directly to a certain skit. The discs also contain separate sections that contain highlights from each season as a whole, so you can revisit hilarious classics like ""Ernie Counts Sheep"", ""Grover's Restaurant"", ""Sesame Street News: Rapunzel"", trippy cartoons like ""Loaf of Bread, Container of Milk, and Stick of Butter"", ""Alligator King"", ""The Pinball Song"", and great songs like ""Bein' Green"", ""Rubber Duckie"", ""C Is For Cookie"", and ""I Love Trash"".

There are also remarkable celebrity appearances, with Bill Cosby, Jackie Robinson, James Earl Jones, Lou Rawls and Carol Burnett counting or reciting the alphabet.

It's also interesting to see our favorite characters before they were fully developed: Big Bird is initially presented as an extraordinarily simple-minded goofy character and Oscar is a strange nuclear orange.

The booklet is packed full of information on the behind-the-scenes process and includes a mini-almanac  to help put things in perspective (when Sesame Street debuted, the average median income was less than $9000!). There's a mini-pullout puzzle section aimed at children, but I can't see too many kids actually bothering with it. Plus, the grownups won't want to tear up their booklet!

If you're feeling reflective and want to revisit pre-Elmo Sesame Street, this is an essential purchase that gives you the nostalgia fix you need without wearing out its welcome.",1163030400,19,3957,5.3099041533546325
2629916,5,B000H6SY8C,I was born in 1961. I was born before Sesame St. in 1969. That's when the first time PBS had Sesame St. This before Embo or baby bear. I have watch it when my little sister Gail was born. I had the cookie moster pupput. I don't have any more. We also had LP record of Sesame St. This before the CD's came out.,1162166400,5,309,3.84375
2629917,4,B000H6SY8C,"It's about time these things went on DVD. The classic episodes are great. I don't have Noggin, so up until now I had to resort to YouTube to see them. I bought the DVDs to watch with my two-year old daughter - even though they don't have Elmo in them, she likes the other characters too. I might not show her the first episode (it's pretty trippy), but it was great watching how it all got started. The pitch film was very funny - it's a lot more like the Muppet Show, rather than Sesame Street. I hope they release a Vol. 2 soon.",1162080000,5,530,4.105769230769231
2629918,3,B000H6SY8C,"I'm glad the first five seasons of Sesame Street have been released on DVD. Yet, I found a problem. The first episode is edited. Who would ever like anything edited on a DVD? Not me. I would rather hang in until Volume 2 or 3 gets released.",1161993600,4,240,4.127659574468085
2629929,5,B000H6SY8C,I've been waiting for this for years!  I'm so excited that I will finally be able to show my five-year-old son all of the wonderful characters I remember from my childhood.  Now if only they would come out with Mr. Rogers on DVD...,1161907200,12,231,4.348837209302325
2629930,5,B000H6SY8C,"At 23 years of age, I can truly say that I have been a lifetime fan of Sesame Street. Watching the 3-DVD set of Sesame Street - Old School, Vol. 1 has been both nostalgic and enlightening. Because I was born practically a decade after most of the material on this set originally aired, I expected most of the content to be new to me (I was barely a year old when Mr. Hooper's death was explained to the world), but that was not the case. Many of the short films and interstitials were familiar (and not just because I used to watch Sesame Unpaved on Noggin) to me as a viewer from the mid-1980s, and I think that just underscores the quality the show has exhibited from the beginning. Sesame Street truly revolutionized children's programming, not just because it was educational, but because it was (and remains) entertaining, not pandering. I'll admit, seeing Gordon with an afro, Orange Oscar and the first few tries at Big Bird's head still freak me out a bit (as they did when I saw them on Noggin several years back), but the show itself is just as good as I ever remembered, something that cannot be said for most nostalgia entertainment (like Transformers or He-Man or JEM).

The set contains five full episodes from the first five seasons, and 54 (the liner notes are incorrect, they should have asked Count for help) bonus clips. The set also includes the 25 minute pitch-film that was made before the series originally aired, explaining Sesame Street's message and motive. Although the episodes have a disclaimer that it is not necessarily intended for today's pre-school children, I believe they would probably enjoy ""classic"" Street even more than the current lineup of shows. The fact that today's pre-schoolers may be more advanced than the Sesame Street of yore can really be attributed to Sesame Street itself, and that's pretty cool. Still, I personally appreciate that the aim of the set is at adults, because so many of us associate our childhood with Sesame Street. A booklet is included that gives a brief overview of the series from the first five years and I found it informative.

According to Muppet Central, a few sketches were altered or removed for music copyright issues (one with Stevie Wonder, one with Rogers & Hammerstein), but because I never saw the originals, I found nothing amiss. What astounded me more than anything was that at the end of the first five years, more than 600 episodes of the show had been produced. No wonder they can't release full seasons! Although the full-length episodes are great, my favorite part are the additional sketches from each respective season. Seeing Kermit sing ""Bein' Green"" in its original form, the ""Bread, Milk and Butter"" cartoon and the ""In in the Sky with Diamonds"" parody is a real treat.

The picture quality is great -- especially considering the program's age (and the fact that it was one of the first programs to be recorded on video, although film was used for most of the interstitials) -- I doubt the show ever looked as good as it looks right now. The sound quality is good too -- mono of course -- but clear and crisp.

Overall, I highly recommend this set for anyone who loves or loved Sesame Street. For those who were born after these episodes aired (like me), looking back at the beginning is really special. It is clear that everyone involved had a true love for teaching and interacting with children and taking television to another level.",1161907200,22,3439,4.717138103161398
2629931,4,B000H6SY8C,"I was SO. EXCITED. for this release when I heard about it. I ran right over and pre-purchased it and waited with bated breath for it to arrive.

When I put it in to watch it, well, I was a little sad. I had somehow convinced myself that I was getting ALL the episodes for the seasons, which is silly given that it was 5x a week. But still, you can't reverse yourself once you get an idea like that in your head, so color me disappointed.

TBS, what is included is great. I'm sad to say DD is unimpressed, but that's because she's jaded. I'll work on her. They note at the start that it's for adults and not ""today's preschoolers"" which is odd to me. It's Sesame Street! It's always been for preschoolers. Are ours somehow more advanced than we were??",1161907200,,750,4.2377622377622375
2629932,4,B000H6SY8C,"I am very pleased that this has finally been released. Quality for 95% is great, and I sincerely applaud whoever is in charge of this project.

A few notes: some of the ""Classic Clips"" have audio in only one speaker. Could have been fixed production guys! I would have loved to see a few ""behind the scenes"" features, or some interviews/facts with some of the original stars, or even some of the kids...where's Jon Jon these days!?

I wouldn't have minded this being expanded to 4 or more DVDs simply to include more footage. Can we really get enough? More ""Kermit The Frog News Flashes"" please...those were hilarious! More spy countdowns too. I grew up in Canada, so many of the location shoots were different...I know it would be asking too much to ever see that footage again.

This is absolutely recommended for anyone slightly nostalgic about their 70s childhood. It is absolutely amazing how much of this content comes out of the back pages of your memory when seeing these skits again after many years. What a contrast to kids shows these days.

Essential & a real treat!",1161907200,3,1078,4.6878306878306875
2629933,4,B000H6SY8C,"They've done a good job at balancing full episodes with minimal (if any) repetition with shorts of the popular skits and segments.  I find the announcer cartoon (called Bob) annoying and an unnecessary delaying tactic to get to the episodes.  If you skip to the next chapter you miss the beginning.  If you don't you're stuck listening to him.  He may provide some useful info, but nothing I wouldn't want to be able to easily skip.  Some of the sound and video quality is poor.  Fuzzy film, blown out or faded colors.  I'm guessing that the masters have degraded some, it is kind of interesting to hear record pops and static on ""Being green"" (Pretty minor distraction just at the beginning).  Anyhow all these are minor quibbles.  It was great to see the episodes and sketches as well as see the early incarnation of these characters. (It looks like Big bird is missing half his head and Oscar is Yellow!)

So the info I was looking for before I bought the disc and still haven't seen anyonepost it is what is on the DVD's.  If you'd rather be surprised, stop reading now.  If you would like to know what is listed as being on the DVD's, read on true believer...

2629934,5,B000H6SY8C,"I have been an avid fan of Sesame Street since the age of six weeks, when my mom placed me in my baby swing in front of the TV on an autumn day in 1976.

I just received this set today and I watched it from beginning to end. The episodes are crystal clear, fully restored, and completely unedited, unlike the versions shown on Noggin. I saw many clips that brought back fond memories, including the classic sketch where Bert is disturbed by water dripping in the bathroom and asks Ernie to ""do something about it"". In response, Ernie turns on the radio to drown out the sound of the faucet, and then turns on the vacuum cleaner to drown out the sound of the radio! Absolutely hilarious! All of your other old school Muppet characters are here, including Grover, Cookie Monster, Oscar (shown in his original orange color and his telltale green fur), Herry, Little Bird,  Kermit the Frog Prairie Dawn, and of course, Big Bird and Snuffy! All of the actors look so fresh and young and you gotta love them 70s outfits! In addition to the five season premieres, there are also ""classic clips"" from each season as well as the original sales reel hosted by Kermit the Frog and Rowlf the Dog (who would later star in the Muppet Show) explaining what this new show called Sesame Street was all about.

I am glad that Sesame Workshop (formerly known to us old schoolers as the Children's Television Workshop) finally listened to the pleas of us thirty-somethings. I hope that there will be more episodes to come. This is a set that I will treasure for years to come and someday hope to share it with my own children.",1161820800,115,1606,4.493150684931507

Please, Sesame Workshop.  1975-79 next, and then '80-'85. And then go back and do season sets.  And then Square One TV.
