To put it in a brief non-spoiler summary, Saikano takes place amidst a huge war. Our main characters are Chise and Shuji who lived in a peaceful small town that is not affected by this war...yet. However, Japan needs a weapon to turn the tide of the war and Chise becomes this weapon

This anime successfully depicted the true site of war: not all-the-time glorious gung-ho fighting seen in some movies or video games. But the cold long days of war, filled with death and fear. While going through the series, its just character after character dying in what appears to be a World War going on.

Much character development was present as the characters grow up and move on. All the changes happening around our main character Shuji creates another depressing aspect added to the anime. Yet such things happen in real life, these parts make anime even more realistic and human.

The interaction and relationships between characters is beautifully orchestrated and human. The uncertainty and fear that troubles are main couple Shuji and Chise are those that occur in many normal relationships, and not just those that have a weaponized girl.

As characters die, the way their friends try to move on and coupe is completely natural. Again it is no surprise that this anime has been adapted to a live-action movie (released earlier this year in 2006). I have not yet seen it but definitely looks good, rather than such flops like the live action Sailor Moon.

Voice acting in both English and Japanese was well-done and full of emotions. One of the better English dubs I've watched among anime I've seen.

The pacing of each episode was great just like of IGPX which was one of the aspects that made that anime enjoyable. Episodes all feel fulfilling and keep on with the story. No filler episodes with this 13 episode anime at all. With the story never stopping with the episodes, can be a plus or a minus. Some may not get as attached to the characters as much and thats a plus to filler episodes in such series like Inuyasha or Bleach. Yet by never side stepping from the story, it makes it makes its impact just more powerful.

This is definitely a more mature-titled anime with many deep themes of violence, some sex & gore, and scenes of massive destruction. Again, this isn't a happy-go-lucky love story but about, as the tagline says, the last love song on this little planet. Beautifully animation and story is executed into the downward-spiraling waltz that is Saikano.

Few minor complaints:
- It's a little short
- No explanations of how Chise works as a weapon",1306195200,,2776,4.754677754677755
