8346923,5,B001W4ASVY,"I am raising my children to speak both English and Spanish and it is very hard to compete with the ""English"" world we live in. I love having this ""no english option"" on the video. It is the only one I own that I do not need to ""set up"" for Spanish. And of course, Charlie and Lola in Spanish are great! Besides Pocoyo, it is one of the few cartoons where the Spanish is not being spoken by an annoying ""childlike"" voice. They sound far more authentic than the Dora in the Spanish version of ""Dora,"" though my children adore her too.",1279065600,5,532,4.174757281553398
