433098,4,6302174899,"The world of horror flicks branches into many sub-genres; slasher flicks, zombie flicks, and one of my personal favorites, the summer camp movie.  Movies from this genre follow the simple plot of teens going to a summer camp, and with that taste of freedom, drinking, sex, and such youthful shenanigans occur.  At some point, a mysterious killer appears and starts taking youths left and right.  This movie does nothing to expand on this theme, but it's a ripping good time.  The main twist of this flick is that instead of a regular summer camp, it's a cheerleader camp.  The nudity is gratuitous, the gore factor is pretty light (as compared to many other horror movies, but amusing enough)and the laughs are plentiful.  Not necessarily a must see for connisseurs of trash cinema, but definitely filling and worthwhile a viewing or three.",1027900800,9,840,4.921985815602837
433145,3,6302174899,"Here's another one from the late 80s batch of slasher flicks that go a bit more for the comedy than horror.  In fact, this movie in particular is recognized as a half slasher, half sex comedy.  The problem with the sex comedy half is that it's not funny.  Not to mention the nudity is strangely minimal.  The problem with the slasher half is that it almost seems more like an afterthought, as though this movie started out as something else.  The slasher thing is sprinkled throughout and there's a dissapointingly low body count....and the body count there is isn't very impressive in the gore or creativity departments.
So, with all of this working against the movie, oddly enough the film is still entertaining!  It should be a total failure considering, but it isn't.
The story has Leif Garrett leading a group cheerleaders, one of them his girlfriend, Alison, and taking them to a cheerleader camp(if such a thing really exists).  At camp, the girls are supposed to compete or something.  They also seem to train a bit too.  Mostly they bicker and get into rivalries and other assorted cheerleader drama.  Leif is getting a bit fed up with Alison not giving up the goods, so his eyes(and other body parts) start to wander.  Alison is having murderous nightmares that seem to be giving her ""issues"".  This plot point is really never explained.  Usually if a character is having some oddball dreams/premonitions, it's at least explained to a certain degree, whether it's from a past trauma or whatever.
Well, as you may have guessed, cheerleaders(mainly of Garrett's group) start getting picked off by an unknown killer.  By God, could it be Alison???  How about the lecherous Leif?  The snooty camp director who is conducting private cheerleading sessions with the local sheriff?  The jealous team mascot?  The fat clownish guy?  Or maybe the old standby, the perverted handyman, here played by genre favorite George ""Buck"" Flower?  Well, I can tell you right now that about a half hour(or less) into this, and it's not very hard to figure out.
The bulk of the nudity is handled by Teri Weigel, who went on to stardom in the porn world, and from what I've seen, I do prefer Teri's later performances if you know what I mean.  She probably has the goriest of the deaths, but that's not saying much.
But as I said before, I did find the movie strangely enjoyable.  But be that as it may, I wouldn't suggest Cheerleader Camp until you've seen the best of what the genre has to offer.  Cheerleader Camp definitely isn't the worst though.  There can only be one Last Slumber Party, ya know?",1299974400,,2589,4.727678571428571
433146,3,6302174899,"""Cheerleader Camp"" is a b-grade, over-the-top '80s slasher that mixes gore with lots of hot (albeit brainless) chicks. It's not as creepy as one may expect from the DVD cover and not nearly as macabre or intriguing. The movie is more theatrical and funny than anything. In one scene one of the girls actually starts calling out cheers as she's getting banged by some really old dude. Another scene shows a morbidly fat guy getting his derriere stuck in the car window as he's mooning everyone. One of my favorite lines is by the super stuck-up cheerleader camp leader, said to one of the girls that dresses up in one of those ostentatious animal costumes, ""you're not a human, you're a mascot."" Suffices it to say, there's lots of eye candy, it seems like every other scene shows some knockers. And even Leif Garrett gets into the act, he looks pretty hot in a pair of bikini briefs. But overall the movie is way too predictable and doesn't quite live up to the standards set during the ""golden era"" of slashers.

They had a fat guy who was funny and seemed to blend in quite well with the cheerleaders. It was a breath of fresh air they didn't make fun of his weight and make him a joke thru out the film.

Not very much. It is a good popcorn horror movie good for a watch every now and then. George ""Buck"" Flower gives his usual performance, and is the star of this cast.

The best kill has to be Terry Weigel's garden shears through the mouth kill, brutal and bloody, just how I like them. Unfortunately, that was about the only real kill in the movie.

[the bad]

Bad acting.

Bad characters.

Too much gratuitous T & A.

Did I say bad acting?

This movie tries too hard to be Sleepaway Camp and fails MISERABLY.

[final thoughts]

I have to say when I first watched thismovie I liked it alot. This was about 15 years ago. After buying the D.V.D. 2-3 years ago and rewatching it for the first time in nearly a decade I found myself turning it off 1/2 of the way through. It still serves as a great movie to pop in every so often to play while I am doing housework or messing around on the computer.

My favorite character in the movie is the late George ""Buck"" Flower, man, this man may be the most type cast guy in the industry, but he is a damn good actor. God rest his soul.",1136246400,,1088,4.1826923076923075
433186,4,6302174899,"Great cheesy 80's film. You've got to see this one to believe it. Leif Garrett in a horror film? Bring out the 'queso' dip! See this one JUST for the cheese factor - and if you're straight, get it for all the T&A...blah blah blah.

I think Amazon.com should do something against these gratuitious 1000+ word reviews. Eveyone thinks they're Roger Ebert these days. Sheesh.",1134172800,15,371,4.707692307692308
433187,2,6302174899,"OK, this obscure slasher seems promising... good premise, attractive and interesting cast with a few known names, decent budget and effects, a sense of humour and witty, bitchy dialogue. I mean, you'd think a horror flick about competing for cheerleader queen would be a can't miss, no?

So where did Cheerleader Camp go astray? In two major areas... pacing and body count. Nothing ever really happens until the ending, and after all the build up, most of the murders occur offscreen! So, basically, there's no payoff. What a waste of a great set-up an an eager, game cast. Don't buy, rent.",1123113600,,590,4.841584158415841
433188,3,6302174899,"As a huge fan of even the worst 80's slasher films, this one surprised me. The super sexy Besty Russel (whatever happened to her?) and Teri Weigel (Former Playboy model turned pornstar) get

sent to Cheerleader Camp up in the woods. What follows is the usual killer on the loose mayhem,with a sex-comedy mix. There is plenty of sex and nudity and gore. The erotic dream sequences that Betsy

Russel has are very well done, but why the gratuitous exposure of the fat guy's butt? I didn't need to see that. Sure, every slasher film has to have a fat guy in it (remember friday the 13th-part 3?)but we don't need to see that much of him. Leif Garrett even turns up to try and make a late 80's comeback. They don't make horror films like this anymore in this politically correct age of bad moviemaking, so get this one to add to your slasher collection of films.",1118102400,2,858,4.424050632911392
433189,5,6302174899,This is one of the all time horror classics. How can you not love a hooror movie with Buck Flowers in it? He is the only reason to watch this movie over and over and over and over again! Kerri and the other bimbo's [...] can carry the movie sooooo far.,1103155200,3,252,3.9607843137254903
433190,3,6302174899,"How could a slasher movie from that glorious decade of the '80s, one named Cheerleader Camp, be anything less than pure brilliance?  Oh, let me count the ways.  For starters, the film makers tried to mix in a lot of teen sex comedy elements into this, which utterly destroys any possibility of suspense or scariness.  Then they tossed in (or hauled via flatbed truck) a huge fat guy who moons the camera for a solid minute.  Just what I want in a movie called Cheerleader Camp.  NOT!

The movie basically has four parts.  In the first, the glorious cheerleaders arrive at the camp, meet a few people, then go to their cabins and generally look fabulous.  This part is good, except of course we've got the fat guy mooning, and then there's that '70s disco god Leif Garret, the high-school cheerleader with the badly receding hairline.  We get to see him sticking a sock in his underwear.  Ah, Cheerleader Camp.

In the second part, they switch to full comedy mode.  Most scenes do nothing to advance the plot, but are just dumb, time-wasting comedy sketches, like some rip off of Porky's or something.  There are a lot of dream sequences, so when a  murder takes place, we don't know if it actually happened or not.

The third part is the cheerleader competition, which is pretty lame.  The fat guy (he's a cheerleader, LOL) trips over his own flab and our girls lose.  They spent the first part of the movie talking about how important the competition was, but now it's just funny to them.  This is the kind of awful nonsense that ruins this movie.  The characters have no motivation, they don't care, why should we?

The fourth part is a bunch of running around in the woods, again ruined by the fat guy who is now in full comedy mode.  It could have been suspenseful and really quite good, there would have been absolutely no effort required to make it so, but they went out of their way to wreck it with their insipid attempts at humor.

Overall, as a comedy it's not funny, it's just incredibly juvenile and stupid.  As a slasher it's not scary or suspenseful.  It's basically as pathetic as it gets.  The cheerleaders - the female ones - are great looking, and that's the only thing keeping this mess from getting the one star rating it deserves.  My compliments to the writer, producer, director, and everyone else involved in creating this thing.  They took a concept that it would be almost impossible to screw up, and via sheer ineptitude, drove it straight into the toilet.",1097539200,8,2483,4.584090909090909
433191,2,6302174899,"Within the time frame of the late 70's/early 80's movie audiences saw a real explosion within the horror genre, especially with the growing popularity of the slasher flick.  I do like horror movies, although I've never been partial to the whole slasher sub-structure within the genre, but every now and again I do like to venture into uncharted waters (for me, atleast), maybe finding something really worth looking for...unfortunately, this time around I found Cheerleading Camp (1987) aka Bloody Pom Poms.  Now really, given the title of the film, what the heck was I expecting?  Not a lot, but this film didn't even meet my very low expectations.

Directed by somebody and written by somebody else (actually two people...it took two people to write this film?  Geesh....)...believe me, it really doesn't matter who they are as it's not they ever moved on to bigger and better things, I checked...the film does posess a few notable actors and actresses...besides a few women whose biggest claim to fame probably comes from appear au natural in various men's magazines around the time, appearing in the film are B-movie favorites Betsy Russell, who's also appeared in films like Private School (1983), Tomboy (1985) and Avenging Angel (1985) and Lucinda Dickey, who prior work includes not only Breakin' (1984), but the sequel we absolutely could not live without Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo (1985).  Also appearing is the quintessential 70's teen idol Leif Garrett, looking exactly like you'd think a star from the 70's would as one who has long since cast aside by his fickle fan base and left to slum it up in stuff like this, meeking out a living, trying to keep their name in some sort of limelight within the entertainment industry with the hopes that they'll be the next one found and elevated to star status by the likes of a Quentin Tarantino, as he did with John Travolta, saving him from acting purgatory.  Finally, I wanted to acknowledge George `Buck' Flowers appearance in this film.  A fairly popular character actor who appeared in tons of low budget films from the 70's right up until 2004 usually as a drunk and/or a homeless man (he was the homeless man in John Carpenter's Escape from New York (1981) who was mistaken for the president), who has also just recently past in June of '04.

So, what is the film about?  If you guessed a serial killer on the loose in a cheerleading camp, you'd be right.  Big surprise, huh?  Betsy Russell stars as Alison Wentworth, a cheerleader with one group of....(cough, cough) teens arriving at cheerleading camp.  I am hesitant to call them teens as they certainly appear much old than their characters portray them to be...this is not an uncommon occurrence, and one only has to have seen an episode of Beverly Hills, 91210 to understand what I mean...Leif Garrett...one of the few high schoolers I know with a seriously receding hairline...hee hee...anyway...Alison is having bad dreams, and her boyfriend Brent (played by Garrett) has a roving eye.  Does this add up to murder?  You'd think so, given how hard the filmmakers try to shove it down your throat.  The red herrings are laid on very thick and also very poorly, as the identity of the killer, which is supposed to be a mystery until the end, is given away somewhere around the middle of the film.  Honestly, even the most remedial viewer should be able to discern this plot point early on, given the floopy, floppy, utterly pathetic plot.  I had read somewhere that this film is supposed to be a spoof of slasher films, a comedy horror film, if you will, and if that's true, then the film is even worse than I thought it was, as it's about as funny as a Carrot Top comedy routine or a Pauley Shore film.  To spoof something, you satirize it lightly, but I really saw none of that here.  I suspect the film came out so badly that it was decided after the fact to call it a spoof.  So, what does this movie have going for it?  It is funny, in a completely unintentional way in that the dialogue is so very lame.  And seeing Leif Garrett playing an amorous teenager was pretty funny.  Also, the character of Pops, played by Buck Flowers, was good for a few chuckles.  There is couple of scenes with some nudity of the topless kind, if you focus on that kind of thing, and the scenes involving the gory killing are pretty poor and sub-standard, comparatively speaking to effects in other films within the genre.  Even the method of the killings is highly unoriginal and hardly surprising or shocking.  The murders are virtually telegraphed long before they happen, creating something I call anti-suspense...that is, not only is it not suspenseful, but it actually works just the opposite, deadening any thrills, purposeful or incidental, and really making the viewer realize that time expended on watching could have been used in so many other ways, like shaving the dog or trimming one's nose hair.

Anchor Bay does provide a superior wide screen print here, supposedly transferred from the original negative completely uncut.  Special features include an audio commentary with the director and the producer, along with theatrical trailers for the film, an alternate title sequence using the foreign title of the film Bloody Pom Poms, behind the scenes photos, poster and still galleries.  There's also gushing liner notes written, or provided, by someone named Adam Rockoff, who I think is the author of Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film, 1978-1986, print on minor booklet within the DVD case.  All in all, an excellent release of a entirely poor film.  Also, there is supposedly a sequel to this film out there, and even a listing in the Internet Movie Database, being released in 1990, even showing Uma Thurman as one of the stars, but I doubt this film exists.

AN URBAN LEGEND EXISTS THAT A SEQUEL FOR BLOODY POM POMS IS IN THE WORKS....STARRING....UMA THURMAN. DOES THIS INDICATE THAT HER CAREER HAS GONE DOWNHILL? ONE SHOULD NOT GET HIS/HER HOPES UP.....FOR BLOODY POM POMS 2 HAS BEEN IN THE WORKS FOR OVER A DECADE.

FOR AN ACTUAL CLASSIC CAMP HORROR FLICK...CHECK OUT SLEEPAWAY CAMP 1 AND 2. AND THEN WATCH SUSPIRIA!!!!!!",1431302400,,947,4.974683544303797

So when I came across it as a grown women I couldn't help but buy it, just to see what was so cool about it. I laughed my butt off watching this movie. Even though it is a horror movie the cheese factor is out of control and you can't help but laugh. The killings are even hilarious. A great 80's B horror movie. Great price and arrived quickly. Very Happy with this movie.",1355011200,,458,3.989130434782609

It's not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination, but if you go into it knowing its gonna be cheesy and campy (no pun intended), and don't think you're going to see a masterpiece, you'll be okay.  It'll do to pass the time.  Honestly, I only bought it for Leif Garrett and I was not disappointed there.",1329091200,,363,4.3088235294117645

  I know you guys exist.  I know that you're not satisfied with the countless re-runs of ""Where Are They Now"" you watched as a kid.  I know you're hungry for more.  Well here is a whole movie of Leif Garrett goodness for you to drool over.

  Cheerleader Camp is a campy horror movie about a psychologically disturbed cheerleader named Alison who goes to Cheerleader Camp with her cheerleader friends.  One by one, her cheerleader friends suffer deaths that leave little to cheer over.  But is Alison the killer?  Or is someone playing a not so cheery trick on her by making her think that she`s losing her ever cheerless mind?

  What is the moral of this movie?  A cheerleader Leif Garrett is better than no Leif Garrett at all.",1325548800,,811,4.489655172413793
