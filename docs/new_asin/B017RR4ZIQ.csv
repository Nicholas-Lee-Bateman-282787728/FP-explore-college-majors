7512793,3,B017RR4ZIQ,"""I think Abe was crazy from the beginning."" Abe (Phoenix) is a philosophy professor who is slowly losing the will to live. He has affairs with his students and contemplates ending his life. While at a party he overhears someone talking about how she was wronged by a judge. This off hand remark wakes something up in Abe and he finally finds a reason for living. I have never really been a huge Woody Allen fan. Movie by movie I have started to like him more. Whatever Works and Midnight in Paris are more recent and I think two of his best. I was actually looking forward to seeing this one because of Joaquin Phoenix and because I think I was becoming a Woody Allen fan. This is something completely different from anything he has done before. This is not a comedy and is very very dark, especially for a Woody Allen film. This is not terrible but will not be for everyone and actually set me back a little in my Woody Allen liking. This is a movie to watch for the acting, but not one to laugh at. Overall, dark and different but watchable. I give this a B-.",1452470400,6,1061,4.2835820895522385

7512795,3,B017RR4ZIQ,"This was an interesting one; for the first 25 minutes or so, I found this film to be a pretty thin and borderline lousy latter-day Woody Allen film. Emma Stone is a good actress and Joaquin Phoenix is amazing in films like Her and The Master, but I never really bought Phoenix as a philosophy professor, nor did I buy the student-teacher romance between him and Emma Stone; their chemistry is a little off, and Phoenix, as good as he often is, felt miscast. He captures the nihilism and misanthropy of this character well, but I couldn't help but think that someone like Michael Fassbender may have been a better fit as the brilliant, alluring older man.

Scenes in the classroom where Phoenix is meant to inspire students fall flat, as do lines like, Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom,"" and, ""I couldn't remember the reason for living, and when I did it wasn't convincing."" In Irrational Mans first act, neither Allens writing nor Phoenixs performance really satisfies, and its frustrating to see Emma Stonea charming and talented actressplaying a somewhat under-developed, largely generic ingnue.

Then an interesting thing happens: after the mediocre first half-hour, things move in a more interesting and fascinating direction and the student-teacher romance is brushed to the side in favor of a rather interesting mystery. I don't want to give too much away, but lets just say that after watching Crimes and Misdemeanors, Match Point, Cassandras Dream, and this film, its apparent that Woody Allen likes Fyodor Dostoyevskys Crime and Punishment nearly as much as Martin Scorsese likes Gimme Shelter by The Rolling Stones. (Not that theres anything wrong with that, of course.)

I don't necessarily believe that all of the characters actions would actually happen in real life, but despite some contrivances and implausibilities (and an ending that Im still wrapping my head around), I found the last hour or so of this film to be highly entertaining and effectively suspenseful. The plot went in directions that I didn't expect, and the characters start to feel more real; Emma Stones character sheds her naivet and becomes far more interesting, amongst other things. This is minor Allen, to be sure, but its worth a watch for fans of his.",1452124800,8,2246,5.0
7512796,4,B017RR4ZIQ,"1. First star for: the jazz score...good pick.
2. Second star for: the intrigue involving the murder that kept me watching this film.
3. Third star for: perfectly capturing New England middle class/upper class little college town society (specifically women).
4. Fourth star: for Joaquin and his portrayal of disillusion, nihilistic, and existentially-poetic character of Abe Lucas.

___________BEWARE: POSSIBLE PLOT-LINE SPOILERS !!!_________________

Irrational Man (2015) a somewhat poor attempt at recreating something out of Dostoevsky's ""Crime and Punishment"".  I wanted to give this film 5 stars because I was really hoping that the ending will be different...but Woody decided to stick to his morality-tales and good ethics and had it ended the Hollywood-way.  The first hour of the film is mediocre/O.K. (with exception to the murder planing which is the best part of the first hour) the whole background story of  student-professor romance is weak and boring  to watch, mainly because:

1) Emma Stone is terribly-fake in this film, I don't think she is a good actress (her agent should advise her to seek other profession; also she could use some sun-light)
2) there is no chemistry between Joaquin and Emma.  There is better on screen chemistry between Joaquin and Parker...the two actually look good together.

The film picks up after 60 minutes, but the ending is disappointing for me.  It could have been much better if Emma's character got killed (very irritating character to watch),  I wish Joaquin's character got away with double murder ---and left for Spain with the cougar professor...with the last scene capturing them basking in the sun somewhere on the beach, laughing and sipping on mojitos.",1452124800,,1716,5.295202952029521

7512798,3,B017RR4ZIQ,"Saw it in theater. I will not review the plot. Paul Allaer has done a terrific job of it in his review. All I can say that as time moves on, Woody Allen gets more and more dated. What was hillarious and incisive thirty years ago, feels flat to-day. His one-liners seem stale, his deep philosophy quite shallow, and the whole ambiance belongs to the seventies. Moreover, the movie seems to vaccillate between a morality play, a social critique, or a stragiht thriller. As a result it is none of the above. However, Allen is an accomplished professional. The camera work is flaweless, the acting good-to-superb, the soundtrack fabulous. Even Joaquin Phoenix, although quite repulsive and often two-dimensional in this movie, is still OK. The plot puts the movie somewhere between The Man Who Wasn't There (a really great movie) and A Simple Plan ( a great book but a mediocre movie). However Allen's pretentions to depth prevent it from it being just a good entertainment. Too bad.",1448409600,12,979,4.833333333333333
7512799,4,B017RR4ZIQ,"""Irrational Man"" (2015 release; 97 min.) brings the story of Abe Lucas (played by Joaquin Phoenix). As the movie opens, he arrives on the campus of Braylin College, in Rhode Island, to teach a summer class in the philosophy department. It isn't long when he attracts the interest of both a student, Jill (played by Emma Stone) and another professor. But Abe seems in a deep funk. Then one day, Abe and Jill randomly overhear a conversation in a restaurant where a woman bitterly complains about having lost custody of her kids as a result of a terrible judge. With a jolt, Abe decides that he must kill the judge, and with that his life finds new vigor. To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, in life, there are few certainties: death, taxes, and like clockwork every year a new movie from writer-director Woody Allen. In this latest, it is at first somewhat unclear what direction this movie will be taking, but once Abe and Jill overhear the conversation in the restaurant about the custody battle, the movie becomes a drawn-out Morality Play: should Abe take out the terrible judge? and will he? I will give credit to Allen for bringing one last twist to the movie about 15 min. before its conclusion, all leading up to an ending that I hadn't seen coming. But before we get to that, there is just a whole lot of talking, talking and more talking (which in and of itself is fine, this is obviously not an ""action"" movie), with seemingly deep thoughts and phrases that turn out to be empty. Abe at one point muses that ""anxiety is the dizziness of freedom"", huh? Later Abe (in a voice over) comments ""I couldn't remember the reason for living, and when I did, it wasn't convincing"". Second, there are some terrific performances in here, none more so (for me anyway) than Emma Stone, who also starred in last year's Woody Allen (""Magic in the Moonlight""). The screen seems to light up when the camera is on her. Joaquin Phoenix is okay too, doing his familiar-to-him 'troubled character' routine. Third, there is once again a terrific jazzy soundtrack, with tunes like ""The 'In""' Crowd (by Ramses Lewis Trio), which is featured not once, not twice, but at least three times (including over the movie's closing titles), ""Look-A-Here"" and ""Wade In the Water (also by that same trio), ""Darn That Dream"" (by Jimmy Bruno Trio) etc. etc. Last but not least, ""Irrational Man"" was the last film from long-time Woody Allen producer Jack Rollins, who recently passed away. It won't be the same next year when Rollins' name will be missing from the opening credits. Bottom line: is ""Irrational Man"" a 'bad' film? No, of course not, but neither is this one of Woody Allen's best, that's for sure.

The movie opened in theaters in early August and I have no idea why it's taken almost 4 months for it to finally show up on Amazon as a future DVD release. The opening weekend matin&eacute;e screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati turned out to be a private screening, as in: I literally was the only person in the theater. I couldn't believe it! That said, despite its shortcomings, if you are, like me, someone who cannot contain their curiosity about the latest Woody Allen, I encourage you to check out ""Irrational Man"", be it on Amazon Instant Video or on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusions.",1448236800,22,3402,4.658901830282862

7512825,1,B017RR4ZIQ,"My comments are a Spoiler:
It was an interesting story that kept me interested for 90 minutes, but the movie was just sick and immoral. I can see this happening in real life to people like ""Abe"" who disregarded Christianity and saw life as meaningless. However, if he had pondered the Old Testament a little more, he would see that breaking one of the 10 commandments is never permissible. This is why Exodus 1:15-21 is important if you're in a situation where you need to lie to save a life. His analogy in philosophy class of lying in order to protect people from being murdered by Nazis was the exact situation in Exodus and he should have been satisfied with it. From that point on the movie seemed dumb.",1501804800,,708,4.496124031007752

This movie had an enjoyable cast, two great leads, yeah similar, sort of to some themes in Match Point, but still not the same, can't say more and spoil it.  For future viewers.

The film starts off as a romance but ends up as a murder plot, and the two don't go togehter well.  The weird hairpin turn that the movie takes just seems to take it off track.  It's as though Allen didn't know where else to go with the story.  The other issue was the Joaquin Phoenix sometimes mumbled his words, which made it appear as though he might not have been acting about being under the influence.  Oh, and as I think about it, there was one more issue - in no way shape or form did Joaquin Phoenix ever resemble a philosophy instructor.  While he presented as jaded, he did not at all appear as any sort of intellectual who is truly interested in studying or discussing the meaning of life.  In general, unless you're a huge Woddy Allen fan, skip this one.",1485475200,,917,4.3352941176470585

7512836,2,B017RR4ZIQ,"If you're a big Woody Allen fan, you will probably like this.

However, if you're a philosophy major or professor, particularly with knowledge of existentialism, stay away from this movie.  The only people who are going to think that this movie is philosophically interesting are those who have taken one or two philosophy classes.  It seems more like Mr. Allen's mental masturbation than anything philosophically interesting or challenging.  It's too bad, because it did have potential.  I liked the actors, and the acting, but they couldn't save the movie from itself.

All that said, my dear philosophers, if you've already started watching it, go ahead and see it through to the end.  It took me all day to watch because I kept having to walk away, then came back hoping it would get better.  And it did, in the last few minutes (that's why this isn't a 1-star review).

The strongest idea: a past classic can be transposed onto the contemporary world, sort of.  The catch is no one seems ever torn and twisted, but rather only inebriated and full.

I liked it better than ""Blue Jasmine,"" because it had a nice purge.  Better still though is a movie like ""Troubled Water"" that brings about a true all encompassing redemption and affirmation.  This movie of Allen's is riddled with hedges in comedy, silly theme music, and disappearing murderers in dark elevator shafts.  It has to many accidental elements that fail to suggest a coherent thread that in a metaphysical universe holds the center together to make a wonderful, poignant point.  The center does not hold or not hold, there is no center there never was because the author is not Tennessee Williams or Dostoevsky.  Still it is nice to play on the themes of the greats.

7512874,3,B017RR4ZIQ,"Woody Allen  has made this movie at least three times before, but in slightly different circumstances. This film  is a variant of a now typical Woody Allen murder mystery (Crimes and Misdemeanors, Manhattan Murder Mystery, etc.). Due to its odd-but-interesting artificiality, It invites being viewed, due to its lurid obsession with lying, violence, and young women,  as a psychodrama reflecting the director's torments and desires (even if one knew nothing of Allen's biography).The plot of the film concerns an adolescent-acting, middle aged, self-loathing, pudgy philosophy professor who begins to recast the existential thrill of the ""Leopold Loeb"" murder case of 1924 as a solution to his depression. Leopold and Loeb were two Chicago teenagers (sons of extremely rich parents) who tried to stage a ""perfect"" crime. The possibility that such a ""thrill"" could be imagined as a mood tonic is more believable for such twisted teens than for a scholar of ethics (played by Phoenix), but this is supposed to be a dark comic melodrama.
  The  characters in the film  are studiously unreal, and all speak in a stilted  idiom that is Allen's 1970s-sounding fantasy of how academics or intellectuals speak, in little maxims that seem to come from encyclopedia articles.
  To watch an Allen movie is to wander into his head, and the effect is still magical, if claustrophobic and weird, as he is able to project the never-land of his wishes into an aesthetically coherent visual and textual reality.
  In Allen-land, we find it is still 1979, mostly, and there are:
  Beautiful neurotic women, old and young, who exist not just to minister to a seriously bleeped-up, surly, drunken man, but to seduce him with irresistible maternal solicitousness and a cozy, insatiable lust that needs no obvious encouragement from the man.  The younger woman-nymph (played by Stone) is simultaneously led about by her autonomous lust while remaining unusually mature, consoling and profoundly interested in what makes the prof suffer so.  The younger women often wear short, waist-less cotton dresses that look like summer nightgowns.
  A New England school with gothic classrooms that seems stuck in an early 80s promotional magazine fantasyland of some pricey liberal arts school's college life, so the campus looks like the 1930s of the patrician class.  90% of the brown-and-pastel palette clothes seem selected from New Yorker ads from the late 1970s, or from one of Allen's movies from that period.  The professor drives an early 80s Volvo.  I had to wait for a cell phone to appear for confirmation that this wasn't a strange period piece.
  The WASPY, lost-in-the-20th-century setting where everything depends on hefty sums of cash that allow people to live in a kind of dressed-down leisure (the characters frequent a sublime beach) is a tad bizarre, but such unexplained luxury is common in American films about people who carry themselves as middle class.  Film-makers assume (?)  people like to spy on characters whose real sources of income are hidden, who very rarely work, and who have sex, go to parties and to restaurants for 65% of a film.  (Our moment must be a high point of such economic obscurity in movies about the middle class.)  At the outset the visiting prof is apologetically introduced to a small house (part of his employment package) that is a two-story early 20th century affair, that probably retails for ~750k nowadays.  Such tacitly accepted, unmentioned structural support gives the prof more time to agonize about his neuroses.
  Still, this film is well made, with clever modulations of absurdity and banal horror, and the last third, especially, is riveting and funny, and the actors all do remarkable things with this tight script.  Actors plainly love to act for Allen.  The ultimate crisis, even if it is melodramatic and the ethical issues are reduced to existentialist cliches (again, many come from the Leopold & Loeb case), is still startling.
  But overall, the film's many unrealities make it hard to *care* about any of these people, as they seem card-board figures for Allen's neuroses.  The puzzle that compels one to stay with the film is not, what will happen to these people, but how Allen will manipulate his materials and resolve the plot?",1474156800,,4276,5.094827586206897

7512927,3,B017RR4ZIQ,"At this point in his career, a Woody Allen film is going to be hit or miss. Irrational Man is a ""miss"", but not by much. What momentum the film has is largely due to the forceful presence of Joaquin Phoenix. The story is all too familiar; it's basically the John Mahoney sub-plot from ""Moonstruck"" but goes back to the early 1930s with The Blue Angel and reached it's apex of banality in the 50s with Teacher's Pet..but I digress..Young, lovely spirited girl falls for rugged, pot-bellied, burned-out philosophy professor, as does the sleep around science professor whose academic husband bores her. The second act is foolishly constructed but brings about a life-affirming epiphany in the professor that involves the dark side of morality and karmic justice. The third act has nowhere to go but to a bit of slapstick irony as it's finale. Enjoy the first part, like I did, and jump off the ride at any point after your first yawn..yes..you know where this is going and it ain't good.

7512941,3,B017RR4ZIQ,"Woody Allen delivers his new film.  As usual, there is an amazing cast of actors and this time, Wood Allen opted for another murder mystery story.  For me personally, the star of the movie was Posey Parker.  She delivers a character of the university (chemistry) college professor who gets entangled in affair with the burned out, depressed, down on his luck colleague from the philosophy department (played by Joaquin Phoenix).  Emma Roberts has a role of highly intelligent college students who parents are music professors at the same university.  She studies music (piano) and takes one of the philosophy classes that takes her into her tortured professor's world.  they have an affair and before long, a simply visit to a diner changes their entire world and may I say the destiny of all characters involved in a story.  In order to regain his zest or life, philosophy professor makes a move that is far for expected but it bounces him back to normality (at least for a little while).

I liked portions of the movie, where typical Woody Allen muses on purpose of life and death, and difficulty of mundane every day living.  But then again, half way through, the dialogues just seem to be dragging on and movie feels more of a theatre pay on screen than a real movie.

7512961,3,B017RR4ZIQ,"This is one of those times when I feel pigeon-holed by Amazon's 5 star review system; for those who are largely unfamiliar with Woody Allen's filmography, this film may well provoke a harsher response---at least a star lower. On the other hand, for those people---including myself---who have seen most of Allen's other works, the film is probably deserving of another one-half to one star....

""Irrational Man"" is the fourth (and, to the best of my knowledge, last) of Allen's films which deal explicitly with the theme of nihilism (""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" ""Match Point,"" and ""Cassandra's Dream,"" are the others), and the rational but (most would say) disturbing implications of that worldview.  As Rod Drehar from American Conservative aptly puts it:

""What is useful about Allens nihilism is that he really does see the implications of that worldview more clearly than many, many others who profess a softer form of nihilism. That is, many people would believe that theres no ultimate truth, that whatever you think is true is true for you. That the universe is meaningless; whatever meaning exists is meaning we give it. If thats your view, says Woody Allen, then you must agree that the murderer has understood the reality of things better than the moralist. Of course most people would recoil from that conclusion, but I don't see how any other conclusion is sensible, given the nihilists basic premise (that moral truth does not exist).""

In this one, a lonely, alcoholic philosophy professor stumbles through his days getting drunk, having meaningless sex, contemplating suicide, etc. when he overhears a random conversation involving a recently divorced woman, who is distraught by the possibility a family court judge (whom she regards as corrupt and evil) will award custody of her children to her ex-husband.  Suddenly inspired, the professor decides that he will help this anonymous woman out by murdering the judge, solving her custody problems. In this premeditated act of violence the professor finally finds purpose, and he is invigorated from his stuporous existence.  Whether he goes through with the deed, experiences remorse, gets caught, etc. I shall leave for your future discovery, should you ever decide to see the movie.  I have several criticisms of the film, including Woody's writing, which is usually razor-sharp, but mostly related to the casting----also usually a strength of Allen's films---Phoenix and Stone, both good actors, are simply too slight to embody their roles.  The film needed actors of greater gravitas. Phoenix, in particular, excels at playing dullards (e.g. The Master); and is completely unconvincing as a learned philosophy professor.....

If you have previously seen any of the other Allen films mentioned above, ""Irrational Man"" is worth your time. If you have not, but have any interest in this type of material, I would encourage you to seek out ""Crimes and Misdemeanors,"" from 1989, which was Woody's first (and, in my view, best) treatment of the subject. That film is a classic, and one of my all-time favorite movies.",1464307200,4,3079,5.191532258064516

7512968,4,B017RR4ZIQ,"""Irrational Man"" contains many of the tropes that have found a way into most of Woody Allen's films of the past few decades:  philosophy presented as mental masturbation, ""interesting"" discussions between highly educated and mostly succesful people, an inappropriate romance between an older man and a younger woman, and the moral issues pertaining to murder.  Unlike&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crimes-and-Misdemeanors/dp/B00005AUJK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crimes and Misdemeanors</a>, which I consider Allen's finest film, the protagonist's decision is based not on self-preservation (at least, not at first), but on his belief of what his true calling is as a human being.  Here, Allen's a little late to the table - the theme of the murderer who improves the world by killing truly bad people was explored more thoroughly, or at least at greater length in the Showtime drama&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dexter/dp/B01329A15E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dexter</a>.

Nevertheless, there's plenty of (somewhat drawn-out) highbrow dialog, good music, edge-of-your-seat tension, and an unexpected resolution to reward the viewer, and if this isn't great Allen, it's at least engaging, setting up the cloistered world of Braylin College and its university town clearly in the first few minutes - you know right away what kind of world you're in and who the people are that inhabit it.  Joaquin Phoenix as the protagonist fits the part of the brilliant, despondent professor with varied life experience (he's worked in developing countries, put in time as a manual laborer, has a ""reputation""); he looks as if he's aged ten years since we've last seen him, and must have had to gain weight for this role.

7512984,4,B017RR4ZIQ,"Director/writer Woody Allen is back in the USA for his annual film.  This time, set in a small liberal arts college in Rhode Island.  The school has just hired Abe Lucas (Joaquin Phoenix), a brilliant philosophy professor who is as well known for his drinking and sexual conquests as he is for his teaching.  While Abe still hits the bottle, hes in a deep funk about his life and isn't too interested in his sexual opportunities.  Jill (Emma Stone) is a student in his class.  Abe comments that he really liked her last paper which of course, heightens her interested in him.  We can see where this might lead but surprisingly Abe rejects Jills advances.  After all she has a steady boyfriend (Jamie Blackley) and well, it wouldnt be appropriate.  That doesnt mean they cant be friends.  Another woman also has eyes for Abe.  Rita (Parker Posey) is an unhappily married chemistry professor.

One day Abe and Jill are having lunch and in the booth behind them they overhear a woman telling her friends how her estranged husband is insisting he have custody of their children even though he ignores them when they are with him.  The lout is evidently friendly with the judge who continues to rule against the woman.  Shes extremely distraught.  Abe sees the light that brings him out of his depressive state.  He decides he should kill the judge.  Hes a creep and who would ever suspect him, a total stranger.  For the most part Allen provides some sharp dialog for the characters including his usual injection of philosophical gobbledygook.  The movie is clearly a Woody Allen movie, with certain comedic charms provided even for conflicted characters.  While this isn't his best film, I found it highly entertaining.

The Blu ray disc comes with 1080p resolution and a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  While the black levels are less than ideal, the otherwise warm images are excellent.  Good skin tones, and good detail enhance the overall look of the film.  Allen still uses 35mm film and the grain levels are somewhat restrained.  The audio is provided with a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track which is also very commendable.  Like almost all Allen films the sound is highly controlled and focused up front where the dialog comes from, clear and correct.  The surrounds don't see much action other than some slight ambient sounds and the jazz oriented soundtrack.  Not much in the way of extras.  Theres a brief discussion with Emma Stone and others about the characters and the film, a photo gallery and a trailer.

7512987,3,B017RR4ZIQ,"Well Woody Allen is up to his old existential man tricks again, (and again and again) with his latest well what will we call it-philosophical drama, mystery drama, semi-romantic, semi-black comedy under review here, Irrational Man. Once again the madman actor/director/writer goes down into the mud to try to figure out what makes modern humankind tick. What is the meaning of life in a world beyond our control that has dogged old Woody since he started making films. They could be as high art as Annie Hall or Manhattan or somewhere in the middle like this one but Woody is always trying to pose some great question of existence when he puts his mind to a script. A lot of this film is rehash of earlier material but all lot is a different not quite serio-comic take on one modern mans attempts to live in the modern world- and fail.

So take one Abe Lucas (played by Joaquin Phoenix last seen in this space as a drug-strung out Johnny Cash hounding Reese Witherspoon as June Carter for her hand in marriage), well-travelled, well-worn and well world-wearied college professor, a philosophy professor of course, a rock star in his profession and not some lowly adjunct being paid per course (although off of his teaching technique and style in the film maybe he should have been in that latter category) who as part of his never-ending mid-life existential crisis number 27 is slumming teaching at a small elite college in Rhode Island for the summer(Brown one would guess although the locale given was Newport so go figure except the occasional ocean scenes are spectacular). He carries his existential angst baggage with him of course.

That baggage entails a weariness with life, that middle age life problem everybody faces dressed up as angst, alienation, ennui and, hell, why not throw in hubris (or the films background music all instrumental to set the tone). Along the way we get a tour of the various currents in 19th and 20th century philosophy especially the Sartre-de Beauvoir-driven existentialism popular in Europe in the post-World War II period. Old Abe is bored, frustrated, blocked and temporally sexually impotent (with emphasis on the temporary). So naturally a good-looking philosophy professor with rock star quality is irresistibly attractive first to a fellow female professor and the big prize of every male college professors sexual fantasy dream, that budding co-ed who is ready willing and able to jump into bed with him, Jill, played by fetching Emma Stone.

That part is straight up college romance stuff and not enough these days to get anything but a yawn (or a review before the faculty board for corrupting the morals of the youth, the female youth and therefore a violation against the unwritten law of intergenerational sex). What jumps this one up after the long sexual foreplay before Abe and Jill hit the sheets is that Abe has an epiphany- gets religion at the local diner after overhearing some poor bedraggled woman speaking about how she is getting screwed over by the justice system in her divorce by a corrupt judge friendly to her husbands case. That overheard conversation gets Abes juices flowing (literally as he jumps in the hay with that smitten fellow professor who had been trying to jump his bones during his temporary impotency). He decides to be not merely man but superman, decides to play God and change that womans fate-for the better of course. Kill the judge and end the misery.

And old Abe does so with poison after stalking the judge. Of course Jill who overheard that same diner conversation was shocked when she heard that the judge had died unexpectedly of what at first was called a heart attack then murder, murder most foul, murder by poison. Then as always the pieces started falling together. As always as well crime doesnt pay, the criminal must pay the cinematic price for his foul deed, and Jill finally figures that Abe did that misbegotten judge in. She, middle class and conventional at heart, had no truck with some Nietzsche-crazed idea and tells Abe to turn himself in, or else. The or else is what Abe opted for trying to kill dear Jill in an elevator mishap. But rough justice will out in the end in this wicked old world sometimes and in the scuffle to throw Jill down the waiting elevator shaft Abe took the fall from Eden. And Jill, well, Jill is wiser for the experience. Enough of irrational supermen for her. Yeah, Woody was up to his old tricks- again.",1459555200,,4445,4.806535947712418

7513016,3,B017RR4ZIQ,"Irrational Man
 This one was a struggle for me.  On the one hand, I have in general no use for Woody Allen's take on life.  On the other hand, I really like Emma Stone, the sweetheart of Scottsdale Arizona.  So I gave it a shot.  And like ""Magic in the Moonlight"", another Stone/Allen film, I found the movie to be worth my time.
 Writer/director Woody Allen has in the past had a gloomy out look on life, the uninspiring notion that life is long and pointless, often painful, and then you die, all to no purpose.  In ""Irrational Man"" he creates a university philosophy professor who has these same struggles.  But instead of lauding the intellectual courage of the teacher, he deconstructs him, ultimately showing that it is his philosophy that is hollow, not existence in general.  Good for you Woody.
 Joaquin Phoenix plays the professor, confused, often drunk, depressed and selfish.  He finds life dreary, painful and pointless until-----he decides to kill a stranger.  Then he perks up.  He has something interesting to do, something exciting to occupy his time.  His zest for life returns, not to say also his ability to successfully embrace the two women in his life, Parker Posey as the campus faculty tramp and Emma Stone, his intrigued young student.  Stone is the heart of the film, asking and answering the important questions that seem to escape the professor, now that he is fully engaged in life.
 The brilliant, superbly educated and subtle professor uses his logic to determine that he has the moral right to decide the life or death of a stranger, the ultimate philosophical prize.
 We do have a queasy moment or two when we think of the older, more experienced man who allows the younger, much less experienced young woman to fall in love with him.  It cuts too close to the real life relationship between Allen and his step-daughter.  Icky, that is.
  The short, one hour and 35 minute film wears an R rating for theme and adult situations more than for crude language or naked skin.  The love scenes are quite discreet by current standards.  The producers did not disclose the film's budget but it took in a reasonable $27 million at the box office, nearly all over seas rather than in the North American market.  Even with another actress in Emma Stone's role, I would have found the film interesting and watchable.  With her, I ate up every frame.

He is not so much using Dostoevsky as a plot pattern, or just updating Dostoevsky, but considering his differences from him and other existentialists like Kierkegaard and responding in kind. Some of the philosophy is a bit dated -- i.e., I can't believe that situational ethics would raise eyebrows anywhere but a fundamentalist Bible college -- but it's never stupid. You can tell Allen has read these texts and is thinking about them. The film is very much worth watching, and if it were his last film, it would put a nice bookend on his career.

Woody is re-working and synthesizing ""Crimes and Misdemeanors"" and ""Deconstructing Harry"". He is now doing derivative versions of his own stuff. That's OK. The story stands alone and would be a better movie with other, perhaps, unknown, actors. OR on the stage. The story and scenery are the strongest aspects of this movie. A few other comments: I understand why Woody would want to cast Phoenix. He's a terrific actor, BUT not in this role. Emma Stone is good in any role. I love Parker Posey and want to see her in more movies, but we have to admit, she is showing her age. Advice to film makers: keep casting Ms. Posey, but give her roles, preferably, central roles, that are consistent with her age and talents (which are many).

7513108,3,B017RR4ZIQ,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Woody Allen has had a long standing yet rollercoaster styled career. He started out as a write, took to stand-up comedy, parlayed that into a film career that started slowly and pinnacled in the early 90s. That was about halfway through the 50 some movies hes directed. Since that time hes made movies that the critics continue to writer about lovingly while audiences dwindle. As a fan of many of his earlier films Ive watched nearly all of them with interest but at the same time have found myself less than enthusiastic over his most recent output. For me they almost feel as if instead of making movies that are funny or observations of the things that have happened in his life and those around him, he takes an idea and tries to surround it with plot lines that don't seem strong enough for a feature film but might make a good episode of a TV series.

Allens newest film is IRRATIONAL MAN, the story of Abe Lucas (Joaquin Phoenix), a philosophy professor arriving at small college in Rhode Island to take on a new job there under less than exciting circumstances. Lucas brings along with him a reputation for being an alcoholic and womanizer which has seen his standing among his peers lessen. Before he even teaches his first class at this new school the talk is already making the rounds of his past deeds among teachers and students alike.

Going through the daily routine of teaching a class he has little real interest in and drinking himself into a stupor at night, Lucas is just marking time in life. He begins an affair with fellow married professor Rita (Parker Posey) who finds him attractive both in his appearance and his reputation. But Lucas mindset causes him to fail in the bedroom (Viagra anyone?) much to his disappointment but not a problem for Rita. For her its the thrill of the situation as much as the sexual tension between them, the allure of the famous bad boy.

Then Lucas begins to draw closer to a young student named Jill Pollard (Emma Stone). Their relationship is purely platonic as Jill brings back the life to the shell of a man that Lucas had become. He begins to think about life and the world around him as he once did, inspired by the questions and conversations he has with Jill. All the while Jill finds herself drawn to him like a moth to a flame. She grows closer to him, abandoning a boyfriend in the process. When the two finally reach a romantic stage where it becomes physical both seem happy with one another.

But along with the change that Lucas has gone through with Jill and Rita as catalysts for that change he begins to use his brain once more. He starts to contemplate the various questions of life that we all face as well as questions of morality and right and wrong. He becomes the philosophy professor he once was again which leads him to a decision to do something that has ramifications on these three characters that most won't see coming at first but that is too readily apparent before their conclusion.

While all of this might sound intriguing the fact is that by turning this idea into a 95 minute film it pads the story out and makes it move along at a snails pace. As with all of Allens films it looks fantastic from a cinematography viewpoint and all of the performances are well done. But nothing stands out. From the story to those performances nothing makes you wish you could go back and start this film from the beginning once more. Its there but thats about it.

I have been able to go back and watch films like SLEEPER, ANNIE HALL, STARDUST MEMORIES, ZELIG, BROADWAY DANNY ROSE and even RADIO DAYS more than once and still enjoy them all. But lately most films that Allen releases feel like this one, like hes making them just to make another movie or to make enough to pay his bills without having any real feeling in them. From a day to day director one would expect that. From someone that many have hailed as one of the best it seems like a letdown. Rather than make a movie or two a year I would love to see Allen take the time to create something that honestly deserves his attention and affection. As long as movies like these are the ones being made my guess is that in 100 years they will be footnotes to his illustrious career. Its not that its terrible or won't make for a nice nights viewing but it isn't outstanding either. Heres hoping he has at least one more great movie yet to film.",1454630400,,4438,4.4716049382716045

7513137,5,B017RR4ZIQ,"If you've read and liked Crime and Punishment, I recommend this film. Although it's in no means a Hollywood remake, there are significant overlaps in theme, and the Woody Allen's protagonist makes several references to the book in Irrational Man, clearly identifying the inspiration drawn from the novel and making this film a beautiful homage, shot incidentally in probably the most beautiful corner of the US, Rhode Island.
That having been said, Allen is of course no Dostoyevsky, so leave your inner Russian Lit major at the door, because the deep introspective back-and-forth that made Crime and Punishment such a classic isn't present in Irrational Man. What does come across clearly and beautifully however is the analysis of a criminal's self-justification and particularly the delusion of grandeur accompanying a crime of this proportion. Phoenix does a nice job of bringing that aspect to life, making this a very enjoyable film from start to finish.
I'll say however that one thing was lacking from my perspective, and I sorely missed it in this film, like a gaping hole in the story line that couldn't possibly have been forgotten (perhaps a deleted scene?). No spoilers here, but a question: why doesn't the protagonist make any effort to confirm to himself or his friend that the supposed ""making the world a better place"" plan was even successful? There is absolutely no attempt made to find out how the actual custody trial was changed by his generous heroic intervention. I find it just as likely that the woman in the diner was misdirected and that a change in court personnel would not affect the outcome of her trial at all. Allen leaves this question entirely unaddressed.",1454284800,4,1693,5.00709219858156

7513230,4,B017RR4ZIQ,"Irrational Man,"" directed by Woody Allen, is set on the campus of Braylin College in Rhode Island. Abe Lucas (Joaquin Phoenix) is a philosophy professor whose arrival creates a stir among both faculty and student body because of Lucas notorious reputation for heavy drinking and womanizing. He soon finds himself the romantic target of married science professor Rita Richards (Parker Posey) as he simultaneously tries to handle a platonic relationship with student Jill Pollard (Emma Stone), who is smitten with him.

These romantic complications do little to ease Lucas personal crisis, which has rendered him drunk, depressed and impotent. When he overhears an unhappy woman complaining about the vindictive judge in her custody battle, Lucas quietly begins to plan the perfect murder, which has an immediate re-energizing effect on the down-in-the-dumps, burned out teacher.

Director Allen has had uneven results in his last several films. Irrational Man has the flavor of Crimes and Misdemeanors with a touch of Match Point tossed in for good measure. Phoenix is a good choice for the lead. He looks like a guy whos hit rock bottom, winding up at a small college as a last grasp at respectable academia. His hedonistic lifestyle having caught up with him, he goes through the motions until the idea of murder sparks a flame. Leading ladies Posey and Stone are both first-rate and portray two different kinds of women with one thing in common  their fascination with Abe Lucas.

The movie isn't packed with gags, and is more drama than comedy, though the Allen humor frequently shines through. With a nod to Dostoyevsky, Allen explores the non-criminal mind getting psyched by the danger and cunning of surreptitiously plotting murder. Woody Allen has evolved into a filmmaker who is unafraid to branch out and take chances. Often, his efforts  are disappointing, but Irrational Man presents an interesting character study, underscored by a dark plot.

Bonus extras on the Blu-ray edition include the featurette On the Red Carpet: Los Angeles Film Premiere and a photo gallery. A digital HD copy is included.",1453420800,15,2112,5.1608187134502925

7513258,5,B017RR4ZIQ,The primary criticism of this film is that Woody Allen is repeating himself mining themes present in previous works.  The response to that would be that it isn't uncommon for artists to have a connecting thread running throughout their work exploring variations of common themes that are of a concern to them.  One would only have to look toward Shakespeare particularly the tragedies to see the verisimilitude of ideas that run throughout his work.  I haven't been in a college classroom in over thirty years but I would almost be certain that in film courses focusing on Allen's repertoire any discussion would tackle ongoing themes present in not only the dramas but the comedies as well.  I went into this film without any predisposition to love or hate it.  Inevitably any discussion of plot or character would contain spoilers so I will conclude by giving this film my unqualified endorsement.

7513261,4,B017RR4ZIQ,"These are familiar themes from Woody Allen. Philosophy of the grand old men of the discipline is something he's been processing in his films since the early 1970s. This time he crosses it with the Leopold and Loeb murder from the 1920s. Those two men were brilliant, like Abe here, but were entirely caught up in philosophy too. They decided they were supermen and could kill someone because they were outside the laws of men. They were also deeply conflicted over being gay which gave them a substitute conflict. Abe isn't gay but he is impotent and he sees dancing on the edge with death as a way of bringing himself back to life in all respects.

Allen has been fascinated with murder vs. crime and punishment in ""Crimes and Misdemeanor,"" ""Match Point"" and now ""Irrational Man."" Both ""Match Point"" and ""Irrational Man"" lack the brilliant comedic counterpoint from ""Crimes and Misdemeanors.""  So that film was the A+ of his efforts with this idea. If you have seen none of them and this subject intrigues you, start with that one first.

If you are already a Woody Allen fan, then you know he makes nothing less than a B film, with many more of them being As. This is one of his Bs. Emma Stone and Joaquin Phoenix are letter perfect throughout. Whether this movie was going to be an A or a B depended more on Allen's script than on them. No one doubts their talent (or they shouldn't). This is obviously a writing idea that continues to fascinate Woody Allen.  I think he may want to consider that he already has done his best with the idea and maybe it is time to try another idea.

The irrational man is a philosophical concept from one of the central philosophers of the old school. That is why it was titled thusly.",1452902400,3,1721,4.503205128205129

One of its many parts is to show a certain interplay between certain mainstream mores and values played out in this script by certain women, and the mores and values of a man who is deeply bot philosophical and yet psychologically disturbed.  (Here we're in Shakespearean dimensions of Play.) Together, these women unwittingly lead the disturbed man into chance opportunities to take his brokenness and resolve it by acting it in crime.  That the disposition that leads him into this is his own idea and choice is his tragedy, However, this his tragedy involves the innocent disposition of the women play the catalysts for it. Thus his further breakdown in his life's tragic trajectory from past heroic efforts to understand and help human sufferage, to personal trauma, to his lonely and inadequate ways of dealing with it, until the trauma degenerates into psychopathic insanity.  However, the women also play a catalytic role, out of their own unresolved sufferage and even (in the case of Emma Stone's character) unresolved innocence while still maturing. And, they are as oblivious to this as he is blind to his own self-demise -- even though he is momentarily aware that a breakdown is at hand for him.  In how many ways can the audience member see in this an allegory for some part of their own suffering, as it is both shared and catalyzed by the fellow male and female co-actors in their own life?  Thus the personal catharsis in the theater goer. One last comment: Any pre-patterned expectation may cloud one's evaluation of what such a widely-spectrum-ed, creative, exploratory artist as Woody Allen offers, especially when that artist also repeats style, motifs, perspectives, what have you. Because that artist will also be asking you to stretch with them, and to even stretch beyond yourself and beyond them -- despite the familiar elements of their form. So we can relax all of our disappointment and frustration over each of Woody Allen's new issue and give first place to opening up and being receptive enough to generate the space and the taste buds to recognize that and appreciate -- even while still responding with your own criticism. Then, accept that for yourself as best you can. But this may take time and the help of a few reflective conversations -- internal ones and with someone else.  The gift and delicacy of Western theater as developed by the ancient Greeks was continually to mine and support the benefits of personal catharsis, to awaken some awareness in ourselves about ourselves. So I really wouldn't complain too much about the lack of the use of cell phones or computers in a play.",1452729600,6,2786,4.917021276595745
8740097,5,B017RR4ZIQ,"Abe (Joaquin Phoenix): Anxiety is the dizziness of freedom.

Irrational Man. Wow. Such a movie. A delight for anyone who loves philosophy, especially existentialist philosophy, my favorite!

The beginning of the movie is amazing. You can only hear a car and, right after the opening credits, Ramsey Lewis amazing funky jazz. The first word, pronounced by Joaquin Phoenix, is Kant. Woody Allen seems to have made Irrational Man for philosophy lovers: Kierkegaard, Heidegger, Sartre, Dostoevsky, and Hannah Arendts thesis dance in this film. Anxiety, despair, the meaning of our existence, choice, morality, suicide, and murder are the films main themes.

Joaquin Phoenixs performance is stunning. Really brilliant. Phoenix gained 33 pounds for the role of Abe, a controversial philosophy professor, anguished, depressed and a nihilist who talks to his students about how cruel and frustrating human existence is. Phoenix appears like a man made of blood and flesh, vulnerable and tormented, who prefers to live philosophy than to talk about.

I must admit that I am not a big fan of Emma Stone. I find all her performances basically the same. Nevertheless, her performance in Irrational Man is convincing thanks to Woodys amazing writing. Still, she could have bothered herself and take some piano lessons if she was going to play the role of a piano student. Oh, well, those young divas

The other woman is Rita, performed by Parker Posey, an awesome actress. Her performance is fresh, elegant and very real.

Ethan Phillips (who played the nasty IRS agent Gorsky in the 90s comedy Green Card) has a small role in the movie and plays Jills father. I read some negative reviews about Jamie Blackeys performance, who plays Jills boyfriend, Roy, but truthfully I think that he plays his role to perfection (a simple guy in love, plain and zero exciting).

Irrational Man has a bit of Match Point and a lot of Cassandras Dream, being at the same time original, genuine, and surprising. The end is unpredictable and has a taste of Hitchcock. Woody had already used Crime and Punishment in Crimes and Misdemeanors, Match Point and Cassandras Dream. Ramsey Lewis (who, I must admit, I didn't know I have already bought several CDs of his) accompanies us with his amazing funky jazz during all the film. Woodys taste in music is definitely the best.

The Adair University (fictitious), where Abe taught before, is the same University that honours Harry Block in Deconstructing Harry and where Sondra Pransky studied journalism in Scoop (how funny).

Irrational Man is the last movie produced by Jack Rollins (Woodys producer for over 45 years). Rollins died in 2015, age 100.

Abe brings to the extreme the first principle of existentialism: human beings are what we make of ourselves (lhomme nest rien dautre que ce quil se fait, argues Sartre in Lexistentialisme est un humanisme). Man is what he decides to be, in complete freedom. Sartre argues that we don't have freedom, but that we are freedom. Our freedom can never be renounced. Even if we decide not to be free, we are deciding in complete freedom not to be free. Thats what reflects Sartres explosive sentence lhomme est condamn  tre libre[1]. We are free and we are completely responsible of what and who we are. There is no God. We are alone in the Universe. We are the solely owners of our own existence and the only responsible ones for our own choices.

Sartrean existentialism is a philosophy of freedom and action. To think about doing something, to hope, to wish, does not count at all for Sartre. Only to act has real value, and Abe knows it. If we wish for somebody to be dead, the only coherent action is murder. But what about morality? Well, are all men worth living? Really cruel people are parasites, are they not? Wouldnt the world be a better place with less parasites?

When Abe decides to kill the corrupted judge, his life makes sense again. He starts enjoying life: he has big breakfasts (not only back coffee), is able to make love again, writes poetry again, and feels strong and alive. Suicide is not an option for Abe any more. His life has meaning. His murder plans are what give meaning to his existence.

Man is a being in search for meaning. That was brilliantly said by Viktor Frankl in 1946 in his heartbreaking book Mans Search for Meaning (originally written in German and untitled trotzdem Ja zum Leben sagen. Ein Psychologe erlebt das Konzentrationslager). Frankls thesis is a yes to life with capital letters. His message: an unconditional faith in the meaning of existence: meaning is available under any conditions, even the worst conceivable ones[2]. Life has always meaning, until the end (life has a meaning to the last breath[3]) and its our duty to look for this meaning. Our main task is to have to give a meaning to our own existence.

Frankl argues that a person who has found the meaning of his life is able to give his life for that meaning, and a person who has not found the meaning of his life can easily commit suicide. At the beginning of the film, Abe suffers from existential vacuum and does not mind at all to die when he demonstrates to his students how to play the Russian roulette. But when he starts planning the murder and finds a meaning for his existence, he rejects suicide and embraces life.

Frankl argues that life has always meaning. Sartre, on the contrary, argues that nothing has real meaning: everything is absurd (like Camus). We are alone, without God and without excuses, and we have to carry courageously the emptiness of our human existence.

Frankl defines man as freedom, responsibility and meaning. Sartre defines man as freedom, responsibility and anguish. In the first half of  Irrational Man, Abe follows Sartre, and, afterwards, follows Frankl. Frankls thesis is less dark than Sartres. Nevertheless, I have always found an answer (even if a hard and depressing one) in Sartres philosophy, and, for what Ive read, I think that Woody too.

In an interview from 2010, Woody was asked about his vision on life, and said: I have a very grim pessimistic view of it. I always had. Since I was a little boy. It hasn't gotten worse with age or anything. I do feel that its a grim, painful, nightmarish, meaningless experience and that the only way you can be happy is if you tell yourself some lies and deceive yourself () One must have ones illusions to live. If you look at life too honestly life does become unbearable because it is a pretty grim enterprise[4]. I agree completely. I think that neither life nor death have real meaning, so we have to create, love and grow as much as we can in order to not to succumb to despair.

Irrational Man is an absolutely brilliant film. A delightful masterpiece. 10 / 10
