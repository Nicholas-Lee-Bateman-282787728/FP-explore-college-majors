8496732,5,B000HXDTE4,"As a vintage trailer collector, I have been fortunate to buy and read all Doug's books dealing with old trailers.  The book, Mobile Mansions, is terrific, but Doug has outdone himself with this well-researched, informative, entertaining and humorous DVD.  This is a must have for anyone who is interested in the history of RV's, motor homes, or trailers of any kind.  His Ready To Roll and Silver Palaces are also excellent books and are considered de rigeur for vintage trailer afficianados.",1163808000,5,492,5.049382716049383
