8717215,5,B00XZZMSO8,"I was really surprised by this show. My husband chose this for us to watch randomly and every episode made me laugh out loud multiple times and it never takes itself too seriously. In fact, it parodies shows that do take themselves too seriously.

If you like shows like Gintama, Arakawa Under the Bridge, Nichijou, School Rumble, Ben-to or Chronicles of the Going Home Club, you shouldn't hesitate on this one. I only wish it had more episodes!",1475020800,,445,4.705128205128205
8717216,5,B00XZZMSO8,"This is one of the funniest anime comedies in a long time. It takes the basic Japanese obsession of a school club with all girls and turns it upside down with each episode featuring a sketch format of the girls and their way of handling club activities. Check it out, you won't regret it.",1455321600,4,288,4.351851851851852
8717217,4,B00XZZMSO8,"Momoka Sonokawa was hoping for a fairly mundane high school life. Unfortunately she's molested by a middle aged man on the subway on her first day, only to then be rescued by another girl who then pulls out some guns on the man! Though the guns turn out to be airsoft guns that shoot plastic pellets, Momoka's savior is understandably arrested after the train reaches the next stop. She later learns that said person is Miou Ootori, a very popular girl at her school, as well as the president of the Survival Game Club. Though she joins reluctantly at first, Momoka later comes to enjoy the sport of airsoft battles.

First of all, this show is a comedy. Though it depicts the guns as if they were real ones, with various people getting hit being shown as if they were shot in real life, every single bit of it is played for comedy, and the narrator constantly reminds you that all of the ""damage"" suffered is merely in the imaginations of the girls and their opponents. Characters get ""killed"" in battle, even if it wasn't from a gunshot, only to then show up moments later perfectly fine.

So basically don't take it too seriously, as the show certainly doesn't. The show also does a lot of parodies and homages to various other pop culture movies such as Mad Max and Predator. Fanservice is present, but it's mostly minimized, and the comedic interactions between the various characters takes precedence over any revealing sexy shots.

I also enjoy that Momoka isn't the typical nice protagonist. Instead she's a pretty selfish person, and will often payback whoever did her wrong severalfold. This can also backfire on her though, such as when she beats up Urara rather badly in retaliation for the latter using painful wrestling moves on her in an attempt to get her to quit the club. Unfortunately, Urara turns out to be quite the masochist, and Momoka's ""punishments"" and hits only turn her on more and more, much to her disgust.

While it's not a groundbreaking, it is a funny show to watch every now and then, such as if you need something relaxing to watch before going to bed.",1449446400,5,2087,4.64769647696477
