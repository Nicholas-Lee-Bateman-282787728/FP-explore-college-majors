604065,4,630320385X,"I remember watching this movie when I was younger, and I am so glad that I found it again so I can show my own child! I only wish that it was on DVD!",1298678400,2,149,3.411764705882353
604066,5,630320385X,"I absoloutely loved this movie as a child. Although, I am upset I can only find it on VHS and its almost [...] bucks!!! VHSes are so outdated. If anyone knows where I can find it for cheaper let me know!!",1226275200,,204,4.0
604067,4,630320385X,"I used to watch this movie on the Disney Channel before it was booted off the network. I also used to watch ""Susie Q"" and the original ""Freaky Friday."" Why did they get booted off? They were such good movies! This probably had to be my favorite because I used to wonder what it would be like to go to the ""Mommy Market"" and pick up a new mom. The only bad thing about this movie is that it's not on DVD. If it was on DVD, then I would buy it. I think that it's a waste to buy it on VHS. I don't even watch videos anymore! Other than that, I love this movie!!",1072569600,6,558,3.8189655172413794
604068,4,630320385X,"Predictable, yes... even from the title. Nevertheless, this delightful little morality tale for kids is worth the time. Anna and her siblings turn in credible performances and Sissy Spacek is a delight as all four moms. Don't let the professional critics fool you into thinking that this isn't worth the time of day... it is for anyone with an eye toward fantasy without a lot of FX.",980985600,,383,4.731343283582089
604069,4,630320385X,"You never really miss something until you have to live without it. This valuable lesson is effectively portrayed in the movie while showcasing Sissy Specek's extraordinary telent.  She takes you along a journey in which kids come to appreciate the value of a loving mother no matter how bad the current circumstances are. Well written, with plenty of laughs and one or two seemingly tearful moments, Trading Mom is a movie in which children can appreciate and understand, since the plot of the movie is based on their decisions and realizations. ....A good moral lesson taught in such an entertaining way that the children forget they're actually learning... Excellent!",977184000,9,669,5.137614678899083
604070,2,630320385X,"not much here beside Sissy Spacek (where has she been?) mugging in four different roles. ok if it's on tv, but not worth the money or effort to  rent/own",966816000,,153,4.275862068965517
604300,4,630320385X,"My kid watched it 2 times...now that it's summer vacation and we are running out of things to do...we decided to look for movies to watch on amazon...we came upon this one.  I was happy my 10 year old daughter liked it right from the start....until the very end! I thought it was cute and I loved how Sissy Spacek played all these different characters...at first I didn't even know they were even played by her! I gave it 4 stars because, I thought it got to be a little too long....",1470787200,,483,4.25

604304,5,630320385X,"I had my grandson visiting so I looked for a family friendly movie. My grandson liked the movie so much that the next day he asked to watch it again! He's 6 so it's typically cartoons that hold his attention. I think every kid at some time thinks about having a different parent(s). This movie takes that topic and runs with it! There are so many fun factors in this movie- the possibility of having a mega rich mom, an outdoorsy mom and a Carnival mom (with extended family!) I really enjoyed the film as well and I'm sure I'll get to see it a few more times when my grandson visits!",1469923200,,584,4.223214285714286

604308,5,630320385X,"It is a classic, I grew up watching this movie on WB39.. The moral is nice for children, who has not gotten upset when mom does not let them do something they want? Who has ever wished they had another mother when they were little over a tantrum? Ever thought there was a mommy market to go pick one yourself?  This movie, It has magic and lets the kids learn a lesson about appreciating and loving the mother they have. graphics and picture are not great but it is because if you compare it to movies now it has no comparison but it is just like you would be seeing it 15 years ago on tv.",1469318400,,589,4.077586206896552

605829,5,630320385X,"I watched this film for the very first time with a five year old girl. We were both riveted by this film! Of course, we appreciated it on different levels, but as soon as we finished watching it we were in complete agreement: ""Again!!"" Immediately we had to see Trading Mom a second time!

If you have not seen this film before, you really must. Cissy Spacek is a total delight as the Mom (the real one) and in other roles. The children are quite natural in their performances, but I wish Maureen Stapleton had more screen time. This is a movie that we will be thinking about and watching again and again.

However -- I must complain: WHERE is the DVD version of Trading Mom? Amazon.com has the poster and the VHS, but we need the updated version.",1404259200,,747,4.366906474820144
605830,4,630320385X,This movie holds a lot of great memories from my childhood. Unfortunately they are not putting it out on DVD which is really very sad. It seems there are many movies that are not out on DVD and most of them were really good movies. Yet as always they release the stupid movies that don't even make a hit at the box office and our most recent. I think that if modern filmmakers took a look at some of these great gems like trading mom and other excellent family features they could learn something. These days I find it hard to watch a new family feature that doesn't have some sort of sexual.innuendo or violent subject matter,1403654400,,626,4.358974358974359
605831,5,630320385X,"I enjoy most things in life. So, I may not be the best to review things. But, I did enjoy this. It is hard to remember the details since I am reviewing this years later. I am sure it was corny and not cool to a lot of people. But, I love corny. It is crazy how people always have to change or realize things after and not during. So strange. I never understood. I appreciate all things in the moment. You tend to wish for things you do not have or for things to be different. But, I would never seriously wish it. I may think it, but I love my family. No exchanging for me! :-D",1397174400,,577,3.8983050847457625

Still has the same appeal and a great message.

605833,4,630320385X,"I found this movie very entertaining, my grand daughter enjoyed it also. I am disappointed that this movie was never released in theaters here in the US.  How many times do kids wish they could trade their moms in for another. My sister assisted with the animals in this movie and had the once in a lifetime opportunity to play the part of the pet mom.",1395360000,,352,4.333333333333333

605930,5,630320385X,Good story with the right balance of Corny and simply pastel. Sissy did a good job. Good classic for kids.,1363478400,,106,4.35
605931,3,630320385X,"I guess it was entertaining enough to keep us from being bored, but the whole premise of the movie, at times, felt a little ""off"" and slightly uncomfortable (although I am a mom so maybe that's why).  But of course in the end it all works out.",1360454400,,243,4.170212765957447
605932,4,630320385X,"My daughter and I used to love this movie when it played on cable. It is a silly and fun family movie. If you're looking for a serious movie, keep looking. Entertaining if you're looking for a humorous kids' movie that a mom can enjoy too.

Hope they make a DVD, because I won't spend more than two dollars on VHS tapes; the quality is just not worth these high prices for VHS.",1355616000,,377,4.164383561643835

605935,4,630320385X,"I enjoyed watching a family friendly, cute, yet entertaining older movie.  They don't make many clean films anymore. It is nice not to have to worry about nudity or profanity which happens to be in children's movies these days.",1351209600,,227,4.82051282051282
605936,5,630320385X,"I watched this with my older sister when we were children (I'm 22 and she's 24) and we still love it after all these years.

Trading Mom tells the story of 3 children who make a wish to replace their mother. When they wake up, she's gone and they head to the Mommy Market to choose a new one. Each of the children gets to choose a mom with hilarious results. But could it be that the mom they got rid of is the best one of all?

I love this film, but it's not necessary to buy it. You can watch it for free on [...] (just search ""Trading Mom""). You're welcome.",1319760000,2,560,3.9469026548672566

7841560,5,630320385X,"My husband and I were thinking back to our childhood and remembering old movies we use to watch and well this one came to mind. It is very hard to find movies you have seen in the past and still be able to watch them. So we checked Netflix and it wasn't on there so we checked Amazon Movies and what do you know, it was listed. It was $3.99 to rent, which was upsetting but we purchased it anyway because we wanted to watch it. I love this movie and it is a great show for kids, makes the kids really want to think twice about trading mommy for a new one!!!",1484611200,,557,3.938053097345133
