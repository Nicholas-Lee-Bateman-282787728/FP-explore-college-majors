1364230,5,B00004WGBG,"I have always been a big fan of Benny Hill.  Sheesh nonsense, but there are time when you need to laugh at silly stuff.  These are the very early Hill work, most Yanks have never seen, culled from the Benny Hill Show which ran on Brit telly from 1955-1968.

The quality reflects this, but hey, all shows of this period will.  In a way, it add that ""time capsule"" feel.

The jokes are corny, the skits sublime.  For anyone who is a BH fan this is a must!",1126310400,21,453,4.090909090909091
1364231,5,B00004WGBG,"What great stuff. There are 3 approx. 1 hr sets of skits, taken from the original BBC Benny Hill show which ran from 1955-1968. All eps are in B&W, with some VERY noticeable noise and a sqiggle or 2. Does it take away from the enjoyment of the DVD? HELL NO! Remember people, this was a tv variety show from the 50's to mid-late60's. Not too many studios kept up their libraries of past shows, especially with the BBC, since Benny left them at the height of his popularity to join Thames tv. Buy this. It's nostalgic, funny and a rollicking good time.",1123632000,35,550,4.349514563106796
1364232,5,B00004WGBG,"i had no problem reading the box and seeing that the shows were all in black and white. having said that, all three collections are hilarious...and not the format millions of people are used to. there's no Henry McGee or Jack Wright. instead we have Jeremy Hawk acting as Benny's straight-man. amazingly, for skits being well over 40 years old when this collection was issued, the film is in great shape given it's age. i love the J Arthur Clinker segment, a satire on cheap film makers more interested in getting films out instead of the quality. another highlight for me is Benny's satire of commercials. On one video, Benny stands on stage and speaks in a perverted campy British voice acting as a director of a soap commercial. He pantomimes, sort of, all the action taking place in the commercial studio including a one sided conversation with an unseen female model in the bath tub. another favorite of mine is the hilarious satire on pop music and the wild imitation of the Rolling Stones...the silent skit in which the body movements of Benny and two others are choreographed to music is brilliant. These black and white classics are what the BBC watched before he joined Thames Television in 1969 and went on to world-wide fame and fortune with the format everyone is more familiar with.",1062892800,3,1296,4.738938053097345

1364299,4,B00004WGBG,"This is a great DVD for those who are interested in seeing Benny's early shows before he was with Thames.  Yes, a lot of these skits were redone later when he was with Thames, but it's interesting to see the original runs of them before he ""polished"" them up a bit.  The quality of these are a bit rough, but it's better than not seeing them and better than them being lost.  Well worth the minimal cost for people who are interested in Benny's earliest works.  For those who are mere casual watchers, they may not be so interested in these.",1397433600,,541,4.326732673267327
1364300,5,B00004WGBG,I ALREADY HAVE THE FANTASTIC BENNY HILL COMPLETE MEGASET AND LOVE IT SO MUCH SO I DECIDED TO GET BENNY HILL THE LOST YEARS. I AM GLAD I DID BECAUSE IT IS ALSO SIDE SPLITTING FUNNY. THE 3 SEGMENTS ARE IN B/W BUT WHO CARES. MOST PEOPLE INTO BENNY HILL GREW UP WITH B/W TV ANYWAY. IT HAS A DIFFERENT CAST THAN THE MEGASET BUT IT IS STILL GOOD OLE BENNY HILL FUNNY AS EVER. FOR THE SERIOUS COLLECTER OR JUST THE CURIOUS I WOULD SAY GO AHEAD AND BUY IT. FOR THE LOW PRICE YOU CANT GO WRONG. IF ANYONE OUT THERE KNOWS OF MORE BENNY HILL DVDS PLEASE LET ME KNOW IN COMMENTS SECTION.,1396569600,,575,3.9655172413793105
1364301,5,B00004WGBG,"Great collection of early Benny Hill at a very low price.  If you are one who only wants to watch good quality, color video, stick with the Thames TV collections.  The picture quality and sound of this DVD does not compare.  That said, this is a treat for fans of Benny who have seen all those, and still want more.  I really enjoyed the large number of impersonations of famous people, some that Benny did later on (and better,) and many that he did not do on the Thames shows.  I would love to see more of these released if they are available.",1387411200,,545,4.252427184466019
1364302,3,B00004WGBG,"I really didn't know that Benny Hill  was on T.V in the 1950's.  When I saw him in the 1980's he was already an old man.  That's what made him funny.  He was an old perverted man that did crazy things.  As a young man in this video, the jokes fall flat.  Overall, it is interesting to see the evolution of Benny Hill.and origins of his humor ,",1362009600,,343,3.9705882352941178

I love it!! YES.. many of the skits are done later on on Thames, but it is just really cool to see him so young, I mean 1958!!

The quality is pretty good considering, they are better then the ""Lost Honeymooners"" and I am very happy I bought it.

1364342,3,B00004WGBG,"This DVD contains exerpts from Benny Hill's show which ran on the BBC from the mid fities until he switched to Thames Television in  1969. The quality of the shows in black and white is much cruder than the post 1969 shows. More importantly, many of the skits have been redone in the Thames years, often better too as Benny polished the scripts.

If you have already purchased the expensive Thames DVD sets, don't bother with this. If not, then the much cheaper cost of this DVD makes it worthwhile.",1152576000,17,499,4.533333333333333

These are in black & white, many of the puns and jokes were used in the later colored shows.
I have quite a few best of DVDs and collections - this one fits in nicely with all those & I enjoyed everything this DVD has to offer.
If you like Benny Hill then I would recommend this DVD. It's fun to see Benny in his youth doing those jokes & skits I have enjoyed many times in his later colored episodes. Watch his face as he holds a laugh back as the audience reacts to a joke or implied joke.
Don't expect to see any Hill's Angels here, just good old fashioned skits.
Be sure to check the extras out - there are more skits there.",1498089600,,676,3.9779411764705883
