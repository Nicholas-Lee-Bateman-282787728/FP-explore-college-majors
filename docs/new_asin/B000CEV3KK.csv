2460352,5,B000CEV3KK,"The name of this move is the Ski Trip yet no one ski's..Brilliant ! I found this dramedy a perfect blend of comedy and serious content. If you are looking for a film that features gay men of color I recommend this one. The Story was amusing , entertaining and sometimes touching .",1196812800,,280,4.30188679245283
2460353,5,B000CEV3KK,"I loved this film!  The characters are delightful and the story is so sweet!  There is much that is familiar here--it is indeed a friends-helping-friends type film.  So, all the conventions you expect are present.  But there is much of the unexpected here as well and it really pays off!  A worthy purchase--buy with confidence!",1177545600,2,328,4.890909090909091
2460354,3,B000CEV3KK,"I give the film-maker credit for taking on gay issues in a predominatly African-American (and Latino) setting, and doing so with some grace and style.

Otherwise, this story has been told repeatedly with the same characters, and this take isn't particularly fresh or interesting.  The story and characters are completely forgettable, although some are charming and funny for portions of the film.  Add to that this film is poorly-named and has scarcely any more to do with a ski trip than any other reason for a group of friends to sit around a table, squabbling, pointing out each others' faults, and having great revelations about themselves.

This is okay and probably worth a rental, but it's a long way from the top of the list.",1167177600,,733,4.84
2460355,2,B000CEV3KK,"First off, the title is deceptive.  You will never see a set of skis in this film.  Renting a cabin in a snowy area doesn't make it a ski trip.  This indie (read: low-budget) film is filled with bad writing and actors with bad timing.  The characters are all stock: the queen, the hag, the gym bunny, the bland main character, etc.  The actors are constantly reading each other, but not well.  The queeniest character takes up too much space and also doesn't allow time to develop the other characters.  One character is so nasty that it doesn't make since that the others continue to associate with him.  The stereotypical accents may grate your nerves after awhile.  The makeup crew should have been fired because each and every character is caked in too much makeup.  Three characters have baldies and no beards and may touch on ideas that ""they all look alike.""  The male characters often say, ""We gay men"" this and that.  However, these are characters of color that should be fully conscious of racial issues and really should have said, ""We Black and Latino gay men"" this and that.  Because I have read that Che Guevara was a nasty homophobe, I hated seeing the gay Latino character, who is played by an openly gay Latino man, wearing a shirt with his image on it.  This film bites off of Go Fish, the Big Chill, Will & Grace, and many others.  I haven't seen ""Punks,"" but because that dealt with three gay Black friends and one gay Latino man, I imagine that this film may have imitated it too.

But shade aside, I appreciated this film.  I encourage people to see it and tell others about it.  Many predominately white, gay films have disturbing images of people of color.  Pittsburgh is one-quarter Black, yet there are no characters of cool in ""Queer as Folk.""  In ""Jeffrey,"" almost all of the gay men of color are waiters and totally to the periphery of the narrative.  ""Priscilla: Queen of the Desert"" shows a profoundly racist, xenophobic, and sexist depiction of an Asian woman.  There is even a pathetic Black, gay film ""Brother to Brother"" that has no Black, gay couples in it.  Hey, if low-budget flicks about straights of color like ""Playin' for the Kitty"" and ""Drive By"" can be made, why can't gay men of color do the same?

The main character is also the director and screenwriter.  I imagine that this was a labor of love for him.  I loved seeing young actors of color get film experience.  I love that Black-Latino unity here.  There is a shocking twist near the end that kept my interest.  This is definitely an ""A for effort"" production.",1156291200,9,2561,4.567032967032967
2460376,5,B000CEV3KK,I love Maurice Jamal and this film is a beautiful depiction of love found. He is a talented artist and I look for other works by this talented man.,1392854400,,147,4.103448275862069
2460377,5,B000CEV3KK,This movie and an excellent choice for young gay black men to view.  I hope to see more from this guy.  Keep up the good work.,1367452800,,126,3.8076923076923075
2460378,3,B000CEV3KK,Nice feel good movie.  Simple with a good message.  I like the multi-cultural cast.  I would recommend to others anytime.,1366934400,,121,4.95
2460379,5,B000CEV3KK,"Loved it... Full of laughter, romance and good story line, plus cute guys. Makes me want to go on a ski trip with my friends and find true love.",1351036800,,144,4.0
2460380,4,B000CEV3KK,"This movie was very good.  There were several interesting characters and even situations where the opposite of stereotypes would apply.  If you like seeing gay friends who treat each other as a family, with both ups and downs, that is primarily what the movie is all about.  Also I sympathized with the main character as it is hard to find a good looking man with a good personality.",1338940800,,383,4.602941176470588
2460381,1,B000CEV3KK,"This film tries hard to be funny, though the writer/director has NO comedic talent whatsoever. He also does not know cinematic storytelling - make a long story short, whomever wrote/directed this film has no ""business"" in the ""movie business.""

1) The characters are annoying and have almost no chemistry between each other. Their union is completely forced. Within 15min of the movie one can clearly see that these 8 characters would have nothing to do with each other outside of this ""film."" Since when do Lesbians feel so comfortable with a bunch of gay men? And isn't the directory enforcing negative gay stereotypes with the overly flamboyant ""queen"" character?

2) The writing is clearly amateurish. The writer also felt the need to use the word ""*igga"" over and over, yet tries to paint the Black/African-American characters who are supposedly ""forward thinking"" and ""mobile."" Most upwardly mobile/intelligent Black men would send you to the door for such self-hating language. --Keep it to the rappers.--  As stated, the comedy writing is high-school level, annoying, and completely unfunny. For example, in the opening of the movie, the main character talks about his penis felt the need to give the audience a description of it. It was disgusting, yet I'm sure that the writer(s) of this movie were giggling to themselves.

3) The main character is really annoying and has no business as a lead character. He's completely unlikable, complains all the time, and tries to be funny, yet he's not. He's also not easy on the eyes. In fact, there's only two characters in the film that approach being attractive, and they're side characters.

In conclusion, director Maurice Jamal clearly proved that he has no talent in writing, character development, or comedy. I always like to support African American artists WITH talent, but ney, Maurice is not one of them. He recently launched the GloTV network, which I lauded greatly and paid for a subscription to the channel. However, its offerings are just as mediocre as this film. I would suggest that Maurice perhaps switch gears to a production role and leave the talent to someone else.

Where's Patrik-Ian Polk when you need him?",1292544000,,2185,5.038781163434903
2460382,1,B000CEV3KK,"Without a doubt the worst movie I've ever seen. ""Boring, tedious and unfunny"" applies here in spades (no racially offensive pun intended, since most of the characters are black). There isn't even any nudity in this one to make it worthwhile.

There was one line that made me giggle. Our hero, who is turning 30, is having a turning-30 crisis. (Remember when turning 30 was a crisis!?!) He tells his lesbian buddy, ""I found three gray hairs this morning."" She says, ""Corey, you're bald."" He says, ""Not there!""

But tell me, why does every gay movie have to have at least one obnoxious, offensive, screaming queen? The beautiful Haaz Sleiman from THE VISITOR is here (which is, believe me, the only reason I bought this piece of crap), and he's gorgeous...not to mention not offensive or stereo-typical. The man has an amazing body, which doesn't show in THE VISITOR.

I gave this review one star, but that's only because there's no way to give it half a star.",1242345600,,958,4.690476190476191
2460383,2,B000CEV3KK,"I rented this movie from netflix after researching Haaz Sleiman on the internet. I saw the trailer and saw that Haaz Sleiman appeared shirtless and I thought this movie was worth seeing.  I fast forwarded through the entire movie unless Haaz Sleiman was in the scene.  When he was asked to go on the Ski Trip, I hollered 'Don't go!'.  He is a real hunk among the effeminate portrayals of homosexuality.",1241222400,,402,4.633802816901408
2460384,4,B000CEV3KK,I can relate to many aspects expressed in this film. It brings a special friend to mind. He know who he is.,1234569600,,107,3.909090909090909
2460385,3,B000CEV3KK,"""Ski Trip"" looks instantly as some rehearsal to the ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Noah-s-Arc-The-Complete-Second-Season/dp/B000P5FH6C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Noah's Arc - The Complete Second Season</a>"", of which much longer dialogues and self-confessions make this sometime-in-eighties produced movie much less entertaining.

Of course, relationship intrigue inter-linkage, scarcity of explicitly and not-so-much music played have to some extent been compensated with the New York City views although of a low-budget filmmaking.",1227225600,,573,8.095238095238095
