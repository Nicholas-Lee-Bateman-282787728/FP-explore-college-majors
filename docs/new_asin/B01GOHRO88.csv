7764377,5,B01GOHRO88,"This is a gem! I generally avoid faith-based movies because they tend to be preachy, heavy on message and light on entertainment. This one manages to make you laugh out loud while daring to take on the serious theme of religious intolerance. The narrow-minded church folk are forced to come face to face with people of other races, faiths and sexual orientations, and learn to actually like them! The story is well-told, with acting and production values well above average for the genre. It's a family-friendly rom-com with a moral, and it's just plain fun!",1474243200,,558,4.88421052631579

8763204,5,B01GOHRO88,A beautifully written comedy about a church making a movie to boost attendance at church. Lots of laughs plus a message to make you really think about your own and your church's actions. You need to see this movie.,1478822400,,214,4.512820512820513
8763205,5,B01GOHRO88,"a great film for the whole family that's funny but also tells a story about inclusion, acceptance and forgiveness.  I wish everyone could see it.  It has some Christian themes in it (it's about a church of course) but people of any faith (or no faith) will equally enjoy it.",1477094400,,274,4.46
8763206,4,B01GOHRO88,"Very nice to see a clean movie for the whole family. No foul language, no embarrassing intimate scenes, which was nice change of pace. I hate so much to see a movie and be uncomfortable with what ends up on screen. Sometimes it is just plain disgusting. Enjoyed watching this.",1475366400,,276,4.54
