3140436,5,B001570GV0,"This is not your average long-running anime series. Having seen my fair share of anime throughout the years, I must honestly say that this one takes the cake! Despite being hailed as one of the greatest action animes, I have also been pleased to find actual relationships and character development. There are plenty of characters, all of them varied and interesting. You see them age and grow, learning how to be ninja and decent human beings along the way. There are many plot lines: some simple, some complex. And aside from the big chunk of filler episodes later, you will have a hard time being unimpressed or bored with this series.

This boxset has equal parts drama and humor, with a lot of buildup for what is to come. Episode 101 is easily the most amusing thus far, serving up the comic relief after we see the conclusion of Jiraiya and Naruto's mission to find Tsunade. Later, Naruto makes more friends in the Land of Tea episodes, but stirs jealousy in another, setting up a pretty exciting next installment.

I highly recommend this. Period.",1214784000,,1054,4.7228260869565215

3140439,5,B001570GV0,"This series is probably my favorite of all times. I started watching it in Japan, and fell in love with this series. The character development is great, and through the entire thing shows how teamwork, determination and believing in yourself can over come all obsticales, yes even the story is great.

This doesn't have to do with this though, it's from after the Chunin Exams to right before Sasuke leaves the village. I've started collecting the other Box Sets, so this didn't upset me much.

3140444,3,B001570GV0,"Naruto Uncut Box Set 8 is a three DVD disc set that contains episodes ninety-three through one hundred and six of Naruto.  The first disc contains four episodes, the second disc contains five episodes, and the third disc contains five episodes and the special features.  The focus of this box set is Tsunade assuming the position of the Fifth Hokage, and the Land of Tea race.

The first extra in the set is labeled as ""Production Art.""  This consists of ten pages, which are model sketches of some of the Naruto characters.  There is a sneak preview of Naruto Uncut Box Set 9, which runs for roughly four minutes.  Next is ""From Sketch to Screen,"" which contains eight pages of storyboards from episode ninety-three.  For each storyboard, you can choose to see the clip that the storyboard is for.  You can also see the English credits in the ""Extras"" menu.

A link in the extras menu labeled as ""Trailers"" takes you to a set of trailers.  There are promos for the Naruto Ninja Destiny and Naruto: Clash of Ninja Revolution video games.  The promo for Naruto: Clash of Ninja Revolution is the same tutorial with poorly mastered audio that appeared on Naruto Uncut Box Set 7.  There are also trailers for Bleach, Buso Renkin, Death Note, and The Prince of Tennis.

Next in the extras menu is a selection labeled as ""Manga.""  This link takes you to advertisements for Shonen Jump Magazine, the Naruto manga, and two pages featuring other Shonen Jump manga titles.

Even though I expect the lack of special features on these sets, it's still a little disappointing that Viz Media didn't go to more effort to try to have a better variety of special features on the box sets.  However, if you're a Naruto fan that wants to collect all of the episodes on DVD, then the Naruto Uncut Box Set 8 would be a good addition to your DVD library.

In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD box set through the King County Library System.",1271116800,,1945,4.5590778097982705

3140449,4,B001570GV0,"The Naruto Uncut Box Sets are THE best anime box sets ever done!  I used to hate on Viz for the way they strung out InuYasha, but this makes up for that in spades.  Vol. 8 has the same excellent design and 3 discs with the included sketch book pertaining to an episode in the box set.  To make things clear I'm talking about the regular box set, not the one with the figures.
The first disc deals with the conclusion of the Sannin arc, where we get pure shonen fighting action almost along the lines of the Third Hokage versus Orochimaru.  Despite the much weaker, though still somewhat entertaining other episodes in this set, the first disc should be enough of a reason to buy this disc.  Naruto is much less prominently featured in this set, but the trade off is that you get to see three legendary characters have at each other for the first and only time.  If you've watched Naruto up to this point and are buying these box sets instead of the single volumes that they are putting out, then you are pretty informed and probably just need a nudge in the right direction.  So I say buy this despite the filler episodes, because the conclusion of this arc is necessary thing.  For newer lovers of Naruto, I highly suggest starting off with the first two volumes of the Uncut boxes and working your way up to this point, where the story is still very good and entertaining.",1216512000,,1374,4.403162055335969

It makes for a great addition to this series along with her and Master Jiraiya's battle with the ever evil and seriously wacked out Orochimaru who's still got an issue or two with a few people.

Its heck of a battle as she fights to save Naruto who's had his own battle with Orochimaru's flunkee Kabuto (talks 2 much for me).  Excellent volume and leaves off on a good note for the start of the next volume, well worth your money and minus an episode or two that could've been left out.
