2415746,2,B000BFJM5S,There are only a handful of episodes that haven't been chopped to pieces. The addition of the laugh track and obvious syndication edits is really painful. I loved this show and was excited to see it being released on DVD but now realize that this is a hodgpodge culled from a variety of sources.,1137542400,2,295,4.481481481481482
2415747,3,B000BFJM5S,"I can't speak for everyone else, but I'm doubting if there are different versions of this set.  I bought mine at Circuit City, and most of the episodes are edited.  I could tell from the 1st episode when I saw ""Power Burst"" on the scoreboard, and the ""newer"" them song started.

I notice that one reviewer posted an email from someone at Tango.  Well, it seems to me that Tango was either lied to or is lying.  They mentioned the ""full 50 minute episodes"", but during the time I watched the show (3rd season on) they were 30 minutes long.  The ""Victory's Yours"" theme song was introduced late in the show's life and wouldn't have been on the early episodes.  Some of the scenes during the credits are from later seasons. Factor in the laugh track and most of these are definitely from the syndicated run. Since the comapany says that some masters couldn't be used, I wonder if they only used the unedited versions when they had to. If Tango is being truthful, then they were ripped off.

I'm skeptical that a company would have released this set at such a low price if they were releasing the uncut episodes.  I wonder if the majority of the orginals were in poor shape, and they went with the synicated versions to cut costs.  I can see anyone being hesitant in making a big investment in restoring and advertising the show considering who its biggest ""star"" was.

That being said, despite the deception, having the complete series for under 20 bucks is a great bargin. I would recommend it to anyone who can be satisfied with just seeing the show again after all this time.  Even after all these years, the show is enjoyable.  I think I'll be able to appreciate it more now, since much of it was over my head when I was 10.  Some of the humor doesn't hold up, but I'm surprised that some of the dramatic issues didn't cause a stir, considering how Playmakers was received.

I can live with the edited episodes and the bares bones set at this price.  But if there is a version with the episodes as they orginally aired, I'll pick it up in a heartbeatand get rid of this one.  I'm still hoping that at least one episode with have the old theme song by the time I finish.  I can hear it in my mind, but I can't remember all the words.",1137542400,6,2233,4.365617433414044
2415748,3,B000BFJM5S,"I purchased the set today at Best Buy. With the confusion I have seen online here are some facts:

1. My set is on 6 Dual Sided Single Layered dvd's.
2. Most episodes run 22:24. I don't know how long the original HBO episodes ran.
3. There is definitely some compression as most of the discs run over 2 hours (up to 3 hours) per side & the discs aren't even full. The 3 discs I checked run from 3.8-4.0 gb per side.

This edition has a UPC of 844628050111 & an ISBN of 1-579837-149-5

I would be very curious to know how long the original HBO episodes ran, so we could know for certain if this edition is edited or not.

Great value for the money (I paid $16.99), but would have preferred standard 2 hour mode quality.

1/18/06:
After having written the above, I watched several episodes & completely agree with the 2 reviewers who wrote after me. Most episodes are the edited syndicated version. The gentleman from Tango who was quoted below is either misquoted, misinformed or lying. It is really obvious which episodes are edited. My biggest gripe is the laugh tracks are REALLY annoying. The picture quality is also quite compressed. With all that said, while this is a mediocre release, the price is pretty amazing.",1137456000,2,1220,4.502262443438914

Walmart won't even sell CD's that have explicit lyrics, you think they are gonna sell something like this uneditted? If you want the uneditted version go to a real store and buy it. Im sure the version on Amazon is uncut, at Best Buy, and at hundreds of other stores. I never buy any software, CD, DVD at Walmart. The company they use to stock their items will only provide editted material, that's Walmart policy.",1137369600,2,578,4.462264150943396
2415751,5,B000BFJM5S,"I was thrilled to see this show again! It is cute, Delta Burke is sassy and adorable in the lead (for the first few seasons). All in all, a great old show! Be sure to buy the boxed-set collection (released 11-5) consists of all 80 episodes on 4 double-sided DVD's in a nice, sturdy sleeve. It is only $19.96, compared to the higher price per season that are being released individually. Definitely a savings! Also, note that although I have seen some customer reviews of ""1st & 10"" and they were rated low as being edited episodes (for nudity and/or language), according to a representative at Tango Entertainment (the distributor), they are the ORIGINAL & UNCUT episodes. Here is the message I received:

Concerning 1st and 10 Inquiry:

1st and 10: The Complete Collection is the HBO version. To the best of our
knowledge and as confirmed by the producers (Kushner Locke)of this
television program we have the unedited version. In acquiring the
distribution rights to this Series we went back and forth with the producers
to make sure we had the full 50 minute episodes that aired on HBO. The
reason for the language on the box saying some of the episodes may have been
altered from original programming is due to the various masters we received
from the producers. We had both PAL and NTSC masters, however the NTSC
masters were not always used as they were in poor quality.

As the distributor of this title; we did not make any edits to the
programming as delivered from the Producer. We are confident that this
version is the comprehensive and complete original version as assured by the
Producers.

Regards,

Tango Entertainment

Hope this helps!",1136246400,8,1827,4.874193548387097

They probably only included a few uncut episodes so they could claim there's nudity in it.  Bought my copy from Walmart.  Makes you wonder what other Tango releases are edited, eh?

Only a couple of episodes are the HBO versions.  The rest are syndicated television versions.  Based on the added laugh track, inappropriate trumpet flourishes and cutaways, I'd guess the syndicated versions in the set weren't even intended for American audiences (they seem like Mexican sit-coms, but do Mexicans care about USA Football?).  Even the adult content is cut on all but three episodes from the first season.

2415776,3,B000BFJM5S,"This DVD collection was bought in the bargain bin at a superstore. I finally decided to watch all of it. I love comedies and this one is mediocre and entertaining.

First, this series was on HBO in the 1980s. There is some female frontal nudity shown occasionally. The California Bulls is a fictional team whose owner was caught in a messy divorce. Delta Burke played Diane Barrow, the scorned divorced wife, who gets the team.

I have to say Delta Burke was perfect for the first three seasons. The first two seasons are about Diane and the team. She left for bigger and better things. The remaining seasons turned to the players and got off track. Still they brought female presidents played by Shanna Reed and Shannon Tweed.

It's weird to see OJ Simpson playing general manager TD Parker. The role wasn't a stretch for him and he was fine.

Still this six double side discs is condensed for the viewers.  Except for one disc, the quality was fine overall. It would have been beneficial to know more about the series. I enjoyed the series despite my own lack of interest for football. It's a fine sitcom and first hit series for HBO long before they turned to quality.",1391472000,,1171,4.583732057416268

2415778,5,B000BFJM5S,I never did watch this when it was on TV back in the 80's however it's still a good series. In fact I have watched the whole entire series 3 times over from beginning to end in the past 3-4 years so it has replay value. It's a pretty darn funny series but the humor may be a little bit outdated but you can't pass this up for the price they are asking. When I paid for this it was 10.00 now it's less than that. The only downside is all the discs are double sided but if you handle them with care like I do with my DVD's or BLU RAYS you won't have a problem at all and will last you for many years.,1376006400,,598,3.753968253968254

2415784,4,B000BFJM5S,"Lol, this show is great. Not because its actually good, but rather because its so godawful. Honestly, i think of this show like the bizarro version of Friday Night Lights, where that show had a great plot, but basically all the football scenes/facts were made with just the vaguest information. This show has an awful plot, its not interesting, the acting is bad and the jokes are bad. However, everything about the inner-workings of a football team is surprisingly accurate (its funny how much effort they put into making sure the football related parts of the plot are accurate).",1336953600,,581,4.878787878787879
2415785,3,B000BFJM5S,"This review is not about the content but about the packaging.  You should know that there is a serious design defect. There are three double cases that hold 6 discs.  The cases are not standard width (14 mm) or slim (7 mm) but are 10 mm.  The plastic is flimsy, recycled and easily broken.  The real problem  is the hub locks.  First of all, they don't hold the disc worth a darn.  Second (this is the killer), the hub locks are offset from each other.  This means that the top of each lock makes contact with the playing surface of the opposing disc.  This leaves scratch rings on the discs.  So even a new package will have scratched discs.  The only way you can buy this item without scratched discs is to buy it used from a seller who has buffed out the scratches and inserted a piece of paper between the discs to keep them from being scratched in transit.  Or else be prepared to do your own buffing.
Although I sell DVDs on Amazon, I will NOT sell this or any other title for a nickel.  That is OUT.  It's a 6 disc set.  For less than a penny a disc?  No sir.  Not in my world.  I don't care how lame the content is, how great the supply or how little the demand.  Five cents is too crazy for me.",1313452800,2,1203,4.085836909871245

The show wasn't exactly high art to begin with, and the bottom line is, a show that was long since UNAVAILABLE is now available again.  Fans of the show will get to enjoy it once again.

Yes, the laugh track on the first few seasons is a bit annoying, and the show's edge is compromised quite a bit.  But again, we're not talking about ""The Sopranos"" here, we're talking about a low-budget show with questionable acting, and a guilty pleasure for all of us that enjoyed the show when it was around.

I'm happy to be able to view it again, and even catch up on the shows I may have missed.

That's not to say that there's not nudity in the early seasons...and everything is back for the later seasons.
Now I'm a MONSTER football fan and I'm very happy about having 1st And Ten in my collection.

But, it did address issues in pro football at the time, and reflect currently what baseball is going through.

2415799,4,B000BFJM5S,"HBO's first original series has finally been released on DVD, and it is somewhat worth the wait. I was a regular watcher of this show, and enjoyed it during its original run. This package is attractive, since you get all of the episodes in one package for a VERY good price. As other reviewers have stated, many of the episodes are edited, and all of them are altered.  The beginning sequence for season one has been completely changed.  From what I remember, in the first season, Fran Tarkenton (your scrambling announcer) introduced the main players and plot points at the beginning of the show, but on the DVD's, there are action sequences from later seasons that feature Miracle Miles Coolidge, who didn't appear until the last season. The ""Victory's Won"" song wasn't used in the first three seasons, I believe that the song ""White Lines"" was the theme song in the second and third seasons, but I could be wrong about this.

Most of the episodes are still very watchable.  The first season suffers the most from the editing, taking the bite away from the raunchier bits.  The show really hit its stride in seasons 2,3, and 4, dealing with some more serious issues (drug testing, steroids, players struggling with the end of their careers, and recreational use of illegal drugs).  Despite some shark jumping (""Team Picture"" and ""The Dark Side"" in season 4), these were the strongest seasons.  The last two seasons mix a more serious tone with the silliness of season one, with a ridiculous ending in the championship game.

Of course, this was an entertaining series, but not great art by any stretch of the imagination. Cheesiness abounds, from the use of pirated USFL footage to the bad acting of the NFL superstars of the day. There was also not a strong emphasis on narrative continuity.  In season one, the team's star running back signs a long term contract, but by season two he disappears, never to be seen again (sort of like Chuck on Happy Days). Ty Taylor (Rick Moser) is an openly gay player who is caught in bed with Diana Barrow's husband, leading to her getting the team in a divorce settlement, but in subsequent seasons he's suddenly straight.  T.D. Parker (O.J. Simpson) is introduced as a superstar at the end of a great career.  Supposedly, he played with the Bulls for a long time and was a teammate of many of the Bulls players, but he was never even mentioned in season one.  T.D. also goes from washed-up player, to assistant coach, to General Manager in the space of about one season.  The Bulls reach the championship game on three separate occasions with quarterbacks who never played college football.  One of them, Tom Yinessa, disappears with no explanation.  The other, Johnny Gunn, served time in prison. The team, in the space of about 2 seasons, drafts Rick Lambert (Marcus Allen) and Achilles Byron (the actors name escapes me), two superstar running backs.  Lambert is a holdout in season 2.  He eventually signs, but he is gone by the next season and we never see him play. Byron was supposed to be a superstar, but he is barely mentioned for the rest of the show.

Interesting notes: AC Cowlings had a recurring role as an assistant coach.  Ron Shipp, who testified against O.J. in his murder trial, has a role as a cop in one of the later episodes.  Micheal Toland is introduced as a troubled player with a cocaine problem in season one, and he returns as Billy Cooper in season 3, and eventually becomes a troubled player with an alcohol problem.  John Kassir, who played Zagreb, beat Sinbad on Star Search.",1141776000,26,3550,4.702746365105008

Second, the advertising is misleading.  It is not as seen on HBO, and as mentioned in other reviews.  The rep from Tango is wrong.  I've just watched three edited season six episodes.  I think all of season four, and all but one of season five, were unedited.

Back to the show itself.  The production value is awful.  In the early episodes, the stock footage doesn't match the Bulls' helmets.  USFL logos are used.  Stock footage showed them playing in a dome while the closeups had them outside.  You could see their breath!  Another goof was stock footage of a night game and closeups of a day game.  HBO probably spends more money in one minute of the Sopranos than it did on this entire series.

The acting is bad.  The actor who played Coach Denardo was horrible.  The characters are stereotyical.  Most notably were the Italian mobsters.  How far Michael Gallo fell from his role as Pantangelli in Godfather II to 1st & 10.

OJ Simpson and Shannon Tweed are the best actors on the show???

There's plenty of plot holes from show-to-show and season-to-season.  See the numerous QBs, TD Parker, and Zagreb.

The best part was actually OJ Simpson's character pitching a tv idea about a football player being suspected of murder or something to that effect.",1141084800,5,1267,4.689497716894977
2415801,4,B000BFJM5S,"Okay, I bought this at Best Buy for about $16.99 plus tax.  Heck of a bargain!  But the main reason I wrote this review was to respond to some ignorant posts I had read.  Particulary to the one about how Walmart ""edits"" their DVD's.  Are you crazy?  Are you even thinking?  Why would a low cost store take the ""time"" (pronounced ""money"") to produce their own versions of DVD's?  For one thing, they sell ""The Soprano's.""  And do you think they edit all their DVD's of the Sopranos?  I don't think so.

They also sell Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas.  Do they edit out the swear words from the main characters of that videogame?  Do they even have the means to do such a thing?  I don't even think most of their employees (including their Corporate office) has much more than a High School degree!

I bought the Beastie Boy's CD ""No Sleep 'til Brookly"" and no lyrics were edited.  In fact, when I asked, the clerk told me they would only sell the edited version, so as you can see, even their store employees don't know what the hell they're talking about!

I really can't believe how ignorant you sound claiming that some store, on their own accord, edits and sells a DVD set?  You are very ignorant, and quite inept at understanding production and marketing costs!

Walmart ""editing"" their products is a dumb ""Suburban legend"" that only very ignorant country folk believe.  Stop spreading rumors, and use your brain before posting such tripe!  The world will be better off.  Thank you.

Stick with Amazon and other fine retailers!  And if you feel like buying from Walmart, do so, but stop making incorrect assumptions about their products.",1140220800,6,1639,4.614583333333333
2415802,4,B000BFJM5S,"Ok guys, here's the deal. I must be the TANGO ""GUY' that previous reviewers have mentioned. I am Director of Sales.

I have now watched the Entire Collection of 1st & Ten  , and here's the deal.

First of all, TANGO did not lie in regard to this title. Of the 6 seasons included, only the first 3 have been edited. We purchased an entire Hollywood catalogue, and this was the only version available.

Although I am old enough to have enjoyed the series when aired originally, I , too, was disappointed that the early seasons were cut and laugh tracked for Network. We feverously checked into it, and found out that these were the only episodes available in that format.

While we agree it is a tad annoying, we can assure you that seasons 4-6 are COMPLETELY uncut. How do we know? 5 minutes into season 4 , there is an audition for Topless Waitresses. With Big Hair!!

Would we have rather had ALL uncut episodes? Absolutely!

Were they available to TANGO? Unfortunately not.

However, we can assure you that 1st & Ten is a very watchable, still funny addition to anyone's TV DVD collection.

In addition, you can watch the first 3 seasons with the kids, put them to bed, and then watch the raunchy bits by yourself. Making the first 3 seasons Family Fare.

This series is STILL very topical and works on many levels.

Enjoy, and be confident in the notion that TANGO has given our customers the best versions we found available. No lies or purposeful misinformation from this end.

TANGO appreciates all the letters of concern and especially those who continue to support the TANGO Ent. line of DVD's.",1140134400,54,1602,4.582456140350877
2415803,2,B000BFJM5S,"OK.  HBO, in the mid-80's, sold the syndicated rights to this show to NBC, which preceded to badly edit the show, removing all nudity and dubbing in a horrible laugh track.  This happens on the first 3 seasons.

However, NBC cancelled the show after the 3rd season.  The last 3 seasons are COMPLETELY unedited and air the way HBO originally intended them to be aired.

Because this package is so inexpensive, I'm planning on picking it up, along with the first 3 seasons as they are individually released, and then substituting the unedited DVD's for the edited ones (assuming they'll fit).",1138924800,6,590,4.801980198019802
2415804,3,B000BFJM5S,"I was also expecting the unedited shows as they first aired on HBO but so far have only seen what appears to be three original, un-edited shows out of the first thirty or so I've watched.  The fact that I've watched nearly the first three seasons tells me that it's still watchable and the fact that you get 80 shows for under $20 almost makes it a bargain, edited or not. While I miss some of the more adult parts of the original shows my wife certainly doesn't and has actually been watching this with me (so maybe it's not a bad thing, or is it?).  Oh well, I'm giving this 3 stars overall because at less than a quarter-a-show I cant complain too much.",1137974400,2,656,4.24

8086152,5,B000BFJM5S,"I remember watching this show when I was a really young kid, and one thing about it that was attractive was the celebrities and the comedy theme of football behind the scenes.  It is still a great show, even though today many years later I was hesitant to recommend because the obvious white elephant in the room, OJ himself one of the world's biggest bastards and villains, but Delta Burke with the cast made the show extremely enjoyable.  There is a fair amount of shots of pretty ladies with nice tits and such also, but the main element for me was I enjoyed the comedic drama of the hidden inside view of the professional sports world fans never usually ever see.

  If you are a fellow NFL fan, and like comedies you may like this show from years back, but be warned that big white elephant in the room is the star and it is very eerie, creepy, and odd seeing him in this past role knowing what events took place in real life when the show ended.

 I would rate this series a PG-13 to R, and thumbs up.",1476057600,,1007,4.268421052631579

However, that doesn't mean that I am happy that 80-85% of the episodes included are the edited for television versions. Sadly it doesn't appear that a proper release of this series will ever happen. Still, I am happy to have this- even if all of the editing makes it kind of suck.",1469232000,,342,4.196969696969697

I remember watching this back on HBO in the 80s with my little brother along with Dream On, Tales from the Crypt and others. While the production value was low this was still funny as ever. Im surprised this hasn't made it into the digital world (Netflix, Amazon, ITunes- streaming ). I have to say as much as I despise OJ he was great in this. A thinner Delta Burke was good as well. Need this via streaming though.",1441929600,,473,4.208791208791209
