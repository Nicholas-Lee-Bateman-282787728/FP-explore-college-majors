3033411,5,B000YN1W96,"This DVD is an excellent source for anyone starting out with hand drumming who want to learn basics but is also great for people who already have some experience with playing African drums in general and Djembe specifically. Jim does a great job of starting you off with tips on hand positions and the basic tones to get out of a drum and works into specific examples of African Rhythms. Other areas covered include Ear Training, Relaxation, Building chops and coordination and creating your own music with the Djembe. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is either starting out with hand drumming or even more experienced as a tool to keep your own playing sharp. Jim's ""Rhythmic Foundation"" is a great tool that I feel anyone will have little trouble getting into, learning from and enjoying.

3033412,5,B000YN1W96,"Jim Donovan is a master when it comes to drum circles and drumming. With the release of this DVD, Jim has provided the skills and knowledge to take your drumming to a higher level no matter if you are a beginner or intermediate player. I have purchased several instructional DVDs on drumming over the past few years and Jim Donovan's ""Rhythmic Foundation"" I feel is by far the best. I like the way he has provided an overhead view of playing the djembe so you really can get a good understanding of how the rhythms are played. His exercises have incorporated basic drumming concepts, ie paradiddles and triplets, which all drummers will become aware of sooner or later and should know.  The DVD also provides descriptions of world percussion instruments and how they are played, ear training, hand skills/playing techniques, and how to play many of the popular African drumming songs you will encounter in drum circles.  He doesn't stop there, he also shows us how to relax using drumming and how to create your own music. As an individual involved in local drum circles I find Jim's DVD and his numerous drumming CD's valuable when it comes to instructing newcomers or taking the lead and guiding drum circles. I listen to Jim's CD's continuously in the car or at home. They allow me to create a drum circle in my own home and play right along, trying new rhythms so when it comes time for the weekly drum circle, I'm there. Jim has covered it all in this DVD. I highly recommend again his CD's as well, and to attend one of his workshops.  This DVD has my vote.",1202256000,2,1563,4.575
3033413,5,B000YN1W96,"Jim Donovan and his DVD are Great!  His teaching technique is easy-going and fun.  I found the DVD to be easy to use, very informative and well worth the price.  I especially liked the over-view approach, so Jim's hands are placed on the drum right where your hands should be.  Very helpful and enjoyable DVD to be used over and over.  Thanks, Jim.",1201824000,3,348,4.4603174603174605
3033414,5,B000YN1W96,"For those who have not had a ""Jim Donovan Experience"" let me briefly provide an overview.  Jim is, by far, one of the best teachers I have experienced.  Not only does he make learning to drum fun and challenging at the same time, he communicates his passion for music and the true spirit of living as well.  Jim Donovan's DVD ""Rhythmic Foundations"" is no exception.  Jim has a true talent for showing others how to feel confident and connect with music. It is this ""connection"" that launches an ordinary musician into a person who is one with their music.  It is in this way that Jim's expertise and knowledge provide the foundation necessary for musicians, whether beginners or experienced drummers, to move to a higher plane of making music. To sum it up, Jim gets it!!! I recommend Rhythmic Foundations as well as ALL of his materials available. I have yet to be disappointed with anything that Jim creates...and don't ever expect to be disappointed. I am confident that you will agree. Get the Rhythmic Foundations DVD and start experiencing what I am talking about!

Here are a few other tips: If you haven't attended a Jim Donovan workshop, you haven't added a crucial piece of living and learning to your musical repetoire...I strongly encourage you to view the schedule on Jim's website and attend a workshop soon!

Lastly, for those interested in propelling the mind, body and spirit to the next level, Jim's Rhythm Renewal is a must.  This unbelievable journey in the mountains is just what the doctor ordered.  It's frustrating to try to explain something so spectacular in words because words cannot truly describe an experience of this calibre...Truly transformational!!

Bottom line:  Order Jim's new DVD, Rhythmic Foundations, make sure you have all of Jim's other materials and put the Rhythm Renewal this summer on the top of your priority list..........Sounds like a great way to start 2008!!  Drum on!",1199232000,3,1920,4.910216718266254
3033415,5,B000YN1W96,"Jim Donovan has provided a wonderful resource to anyone who wishes to learn about drumming and music making. His aptly titled DVD provides the viewer with a great deal of material to develop a ""rhythmic foundation"".First, Jim demonstrates appropriate playing techniques, hand drumming exercises and adapted traditional rhythms. The depth of the material is rich enough to help beginners feel comfortable and experienced players to develop their ability further. Also, Jim provides cultural background information. This will help teachers, facilitators, and therapists who may wish to present this material to others. Finally, Jim's unassuming and often humor infused presenting style makes the video's material unitimidating and enjoyable to watch. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wishes to explore, learn or develop the art of drumming!!",1197072000,4,847,5.677165354330708
3033416,5,B000YN1W96,"What a great resource! This DVD is packed with information. Rhythms are broken down simply and with clear detail.  I love the overhead camera angles, making the hand patterns easier to see- probably cutting the learning time in half.  Seeing the ensemble rhythms performed is also a great help, bringing the bigger picture together.  I will be learning and referrring to this DVD for years for sure.  More so than than some other instuctional videos I have.  And that's not to mention the DVD-ROM resource!  Highly recommended for beginners, drummers and teachers alike.",1195862400,3,570,5.075268817204301
3033417,5,B000YN1W96,"After completing my second Rhythm Renewal workshop, I was excited to get a copy of the new DVD ""Jim Donovan's Rhythmic Foundation"".  My first thought after spending some time working with this tool is that it is really, reely THOROUGH!  Jim takes time to explain it all - basic technique for not only the hand drum, but also for toke bell and djundjun.  Listening exercises, practice tools, applying stick exercises like paradiddles to the hand drum - the tips you might learn after years of drumming and drum lessons, but condensed into one thoughtful package.

It doesn't stop there, either!  Traditional rhythms are taught for ensemble as well as categorized into meditational & motivational-type play-alongs.  With more than two hours of material, you get a whole lot of BANG (pardon the drum pun) for your buck!  This really does have it all, wrapped up in JD's low-key, laid-back style.  Pop the DVD into your computer and the vid even includes a section with links to all sorts of articles and web resources.

From a technical perspective, the videography is really good and the audio is a cut above many instructional DVDs.  It only makes sense that a guy with a platinum record knows how to mic his drums well!  Jim uses overhead shots and split screens to allow for better visualization of handing from a bird's eye view.

This DVD is really a bit different from everything else out there - great quality, solid content, excellent variety.  It is definitely a top-notch addition to my library.  Many thanks Jim for creating such a great product!",1195430400,3,1555,4.818867924528302
3033418,1,B000YN1W96,"After reading all of the 5 star reviews, I felt I couldn't go wrong with this DVD. I honestly have never had an instance where I am in complete disagreement with other reviews on a product....this is a first. The DVD arrived and I was so excited! I am new to djembe drumming and wanted a resource I could learn from and practice with. This DVD was NOT professionally produced! The picture quality is horrible and the way the DVD is put together does not produce a smooth flow. Be prepared to keep a remote close by because you will constantly have to switch to each section. I personally don't see where you get 2 hours of great drumming from this DVD. There are a couple of nice sections with illustrative drumming, but certainly not 2 hours worth. This was way over priced for what you get. A big disappointment for me. I can't explain why there are 18 5 star recommendations when I rate it so poorly.",1238457600,24,903,4.380952380952381
3033419,5,B000YN1W96,"This DVD is worth every penny.  I can't believe how much material is packed into it.  There is detailed instruction about how to hold your djembe and how to properly strike it making a variety of sounds.  There are exercises to work on your speed, dexterity, and listening skills.  There are tons of rhythms to learn with great explanations and a chance to practice them with Jim and his ensemble.  And if that's not enough, there is a resource section that you can access from your computer if you want even more information.  This DVD will keep you busy for a long time!!",1234828800,3,573,4.514563106796117
3033420,4,B000YN1W96,"I would recommend this DVD to beginners only.  If you have not played in drum circles, have never picked up a drum before, or can't seem to keep a beat, then this is a good DVD for you.  It will help introduce you to the fundamentals of hand drumming among many other things.  If you are looking to transition from a beginner level to intermediate, I would suggest looking for a DVD that is aimed for intermediate drum players.",1231286400,6,427,4.379746835443038

3033422,5,B000YN1W96,I am very pleased with this purchase!! It is so enjoyable to watch and listen to Jim as he  guides one through carefully chosen and presented patterns.

3033423,5,B000YN1W96,"Jim Donovan's interactive DVD is fantastic for beginners and for experienced players wanting to brush up on their technique or learn new rhythms. Watching the DVD is the equivalent to having a teacher sitting in my living room - and not any old teacher-this guy can teach! He goes through everything slowly(not too slowly!)and methodically. I have spent a lot of money on instructional DVD's and most of them are pretty useless. Well done, Jim - brilliant stuff!",1215475200,2,462,4.935897435897436
3033424,5,B000YN1W96,"This DVD is the first drumming DVD you should buy and the only one that you will ever need.  Jim starts at the very beginning with how to hit the drum, and goes the whole way through to complex African rhythms.  If you are a beginner, Jim explains it so well that, with practice, you'll be playing the complex rhythms along with him in no time.  There are relaxing rhythms and energizing rhythms so you can find something no matter what mood you are in.  I've played the DVD just to listen to the rhythms and to dance along in the living room.  It works for that just as well.

A great way to get to a party started is to leave some drums out and put this DVD in.  Your guests won't be able to resist playing along.  Before long your parties will be the talk of the town.

This DVD with a drum would be a great gift for a young person interested in music and rhythm.  The rhythmic beating of the drum helps to balance the brain and learning music has been proven to help with learning.  All ages and skill levels can participate making it the perfect family gift as well.

If you ever get a chance to see Jim in person, either in concert or by attending one of his classes, don't pass it up.  You'll never be disappointed and he's much more lifelike in person.  You'll never regret time spent with Jim Donovan or watching this DVD.",1203292800,5,1331,4.209486166007905
3033425,5,B000YN1W96,"As a long-time music teacher of drumming and world music, I have to say that this DVD is the best instructional/play along resource that I have ever experienced! You will not believe how much valuable material is packed into each of the six easy to navigate sections. Jim is a master teacher with a unique talent for demonstrating technique, dexterity, coordination, and how to get the best sound out of your drum.  The dual visual perspectives (straight on and a bird's eye view) are invaluable. This DVD will enable you to significantly improve your playing, no matter what your level of experience is.
 The contents include:
1>Playing  techniques for djembe, toke (bell), and djun-djuns,
2>Fun to play ear-training exercises that are challenging for teachers and students alike
3>Engaging exercises to develop speed and dexterity,
4>Easy to follow lessons for eight traditional pieces,
5>A play-along ensemble section where you can create your own music, or play along with your favorite part
6>Rhythms for relaxation. ..It feels like getting a massage, while taking a nap in an oxygen bar!
7>Valuable printable resources, links to articles, and other rhythmic resources on the web.

3033426,5,B000YN1W96,"as explained in the editorial review, this DVD is for ANYONE interested in drumming....it is filled with information that would appeal to all students, from beginners to established players...the DVD could not be anymore 'user friendly'...easy instructions allow one to travel freely thru the contents with many options for users...it would be wise to first watch the DVD in entirety to explore the wealth of material contained...
a starting point could then be established for the experience the DVD provides...personally, i chose to start in the techniques section to remind myself the proper postions and form necessary in hand drumming....the overhead views are excellent and for someone who doesn't get to drum as often as i would like, this refresher is perfect in establishing proper style and sound, etc...there are many excercises to help with speed and power and sections that allow individuals to jam along with those playing on the DVD....i also enjoy listening to the  different selections chosen by the author from traditional pieces and instructions on how to play them...these are just a few of the features available!!! i could not speak more highly of this video....it is truly all that is advertised...i cannot recommend it highly enough!!!",1202515200,14,1259,5.263681592039801
3033427,5,B000YN1W96,"Jim Donovan, late of multi-platinum Rusted Root, is on a ""Mission from God."" Although the title of this DVD suggests his goal is to teach you African drumming, it is actually broader and deeper. By practicing along with this disc you will indeed learn traditional rhythms like Oke, Fanga,and Mutwashi but he offers far more.

Jim has managed to include an extensive amount of material on this disc. If you're just learning to play hand drums, this DVD is the one you should buy. Jim teaches you the basics: how to sit and hold the drum, how to strike it, and how to BREATHE while you are drumming. If you are an experienced drummer, a teacher, or a drum circle facilitator, Jim guides you through exercises designed to improve your dexterity, power, and speed.

Even if you are an experienced musician but don't consider yourself a drummer, practicing with this DVD will help you to enhance your innate sense of rhythm and improve your overall musicianship. Jim also offers exercises that help you to expand your creativity, develop your ""ear"" for rhythm, and just help you to relax.

As other reviews have noted, the split-screen view -- showing overhead and straight-on views -- are helpful when you are first leaning the beats. However, I urge you -- as Jim does in his workshops -- to close your eyes and try to listen to (rather than watch) the patterns.

If I were a physician, I would prescribe this DVD as a healthy alternative to benzodiazepines, SSRIs, or MAO inhibitors (no lawsuits, please!). This disc teaches you rhythms that have the power to revitalize you, transform you, and help you to develop a sense of presence. For me, the section called ""One Drum Meditation"" itself is worth the cost of the DVD.

Jim even includes a computer-based section called ""DVD-ROM Resources"" that links you to a vast amount of additional information about hand drumming.

If you've had the pleasure of attending a Jim Donovan workshop, you know what you're in for. If you haven't, buy this DVD and I'll bet you'll be searching the web for the next one offered in your region (hint: go to [...] ).

As Jim recommends, ""Eat. Drum. Sleep. Repeat daily."" If you do, I know you will be on a ""Mission from God,"" too.",1202428800,3,2209,4.677835051546392

3267922,5,B000YN1W96,"As a long-time music teacher of drumming and world music, I have to say that this DVD is the best instructional/play along resource that I have ever experienced! You will not believe how much valuable material is packed into each of the six easy to navigate sections. Jim is a master teacher with a unique talent for demonstrating technique, dexterity, coordination, and how to get the best sound out of your drum.  The dual visual perspectives (straight on and a bird's eye view) are invaluable. This DVD will enable you to significantly improve your playing, no matter what your level of experience is.
 The contents include:
1>Playing  techniques for djembe, toke (bell), and djun-djuns,
2>Fun to play ear-training exercises that are challenging for teachers and students alike
3>Engaging exercises to develop speed and dexterity,
4>Easy to follow lessons for eight traditional pieces,
5>A play-along ensemble section where you can create your own music, or play along with your favorite part
6>Rhythms for relaxation. ..It feels like getting a massage, while taking a nap in an oxygen bar!
7>Valuable printable resources, links to articles, and other rhythmic resources on the web.
YOU MUST HAVE THIS DVD!",1202601600,20,1209,5.18974358974359
3267923,5,B000YN1W96,"as explained in the editorial review, this DVD is for ANYONE interested in drumming....it is filled with information that would appeal to all students, from beginners to established players...the DVD could not be anymore 'user friendly'...easy instructions allow one to travel freely thru the contents with many options for users...it would be wise to first watch the DVD in entirety to explore the wealth of material contained...
a starting point could then be established for the experience the DVD provides...personally, i chose to start in the techniques section to remind myself the proper postions and form necessary in hand drumming....the overhead views are excellent and for someone who doesn't get to drum as often as i would like, this refresher is perfect in establishing proper style and sound, etc...there are many excercises to help with speed and power and sections that allow individuals to jam along with those playing on the DVD....i also enjoy listening to the  different selections chosen by the author from traditional pieces and instructions on how to play them...these are just a few of the features available!!! i could not speak more highly of this video....it is truly all that is advertised...i cannot recommend it highly enough!!!",1202515200,14,1259,5.263681592039801
3267924,5,B000YN1W96,"Jim Donovan, late of multi-platinum Rusted Root, is on a ""Mission from God."" Although the title of this DVD suggests his goal is to teach you African drumming, it is actually broader and deeper. By practicing along with this disc you will indeed learn traditional rhythms like Oke, Fanga,and Mutwashi but he offers far more.

Jim has managed to include an extensive amount of material on this disc. If you're just learning to play hand drums, this DVD is the one you should buy. Jim teaches you the basics: how to sit and hold the drum, how to strike it, and how to BREATHE while you are drumming. If you are an experienced drummer, a teacher, or a drum circle facilitator, Jim guides you through exercises designed to improve your dexterity, power, and speed.

Even if you are an experienced musician but don't consider yourself a drummer, practicing with this DVD will help you to enhance your innate sense of rhythm and improve your overall musicianship. Jim also offers exercises that help you to expand your creativity, develop your ""ear"" for rhythm, and just help you to relax.

As other reviews have noted, the split-screen view -- showing overhead and straight-on views -- are helpful when you are first leaning the beats. However, I urge you -- as Jim does in his workshops -- to close your eyes and try to listen to (rather than watch) the patterns.

If I were a physician, I would prescribe this DVD as a healthy alternative to benzodiazepines, SSRIs, or MAO inhibitors (no lawsuits, please!). This disc teaches you rhythms that have the power to revitalize you, transform you, and help you to develop a sense of presence. For me, the section called ""One Drum Meditation"" itself is worth the cost of the DVD.

Jim even includes a computer-based section called ""DVD-ROM Resources"" that links you to a vast amount of additional information about hand drumming.

If you've had the pleasure of attending a Jim Donovan workshop, you know what you're in for. If you haven't, buy this DVD and I'll bet you'll be searching the web for the next one offered in your region (hint: go to [...] ).

As Jim recommends, ""Eat. Drum. Sleep. Repeat daily."" If you do, I know you will be on a ""Mission from God,"" too.",1202428800,3,2209,4.677835051546392
8233462,5,B000YN1W96,"After being totally disappointed in another book dvd I purchased,this guy is awesome!!! He works really well with us ,the student. Explains demonstrates and allows PLENTY of time for you to really get the hang of what you are trying to do. I learn't more in one watch of this dvd that I did in a term of class,with amateur teacher and a month with the other dvd. He is a professional teacher and it shows. Thanks Jim!!!",1382659200,,419,4.384615384615385
8233463,3,B000YN1W96,"This is my first venture into the DVD drumming instructional video world. It was not my favorite. The quality of it was less than steller. It is just slightly better than a free youtube video. The instructor is set up on a slightly clashing backdrop and floor-drop (?) and is clearly reading from a script. I did learn a few basic songs and there are several ""listen and repeat"" lessons. The sound quality is great and the camera angles are helpful. If you are just learning, this DVD might be right for you.",1362441600,,508,4.473118279569892
8233464,5,B000YN1W96,Great DVD would recommend to all beginners full of enthusiasm but not necessarily full of rhythm! Jim is a fab teacher,1360108800,,118,4.666666666666667
8233465,5,B000YN1W96,"The djembe is the first musical instrument I have attempted to play seriously. I bought the DVD because I could not find a one-on-one teacher where I live. The practices that Jim Donovan has provided enabled me to participate in a second djembe workshop with some degree of confidence, whereas my first was a disaster. Also I was able to participate in my first jam session with two guitar players last week, providing the percussion (but not to an African beat). I like the way Jim shows shots of him playing from overhead so I can see what his hands are doing without having to re-orientate myself. I showed the DVD to the workshop leader when she asked me how I had improved so much in only a few weeks. She said she would recommend it to others like me.",1337385600,2,757,4.414285714285715
8233466,5,B000YN1W96,"I am very new to drumming and found this DVD to be the perfect tool to get started.  I learned so much, and was soon able to follow along with Jim. This DVD has been my learning companion and well worth the money. Every time I use this DVD I learn something that I missed while nervous as a beginner. I highly recommend this DVD for anyone that is new to drumming as well as those that just want to drum along.",1327968000,,410,4.0
8233467,5,B000YN1W96,"--Perhaps you live a little too far away to make it to one of Jim Donovan's drumming workshops, but want a taste!
--Perhaps you have drummed before, and want to drum more!
--Perhaps you are a music teacher who could use a good instructional DVD to recommend to your students & their parents.
If any of these apply to you, then this DVD is definitely for you!

The cost is low for what is essentially an extended private lesson.

Jim Donovan's instructional DVD has five main sections:
1- Exercises (for practice and skillbuilding)
2- Technique for Djembe, Djun djun, and Iron Bell
3- Traditional Songs (as a lesson OR to play along with) - Oke, Fanga, Mutwashi
4- Rhythms for Relaxation (as a lesson OR play along) - Nyabinghi Heartbeat, Osain, Mapasa, One Drum Meditation
5- Rhythms for Creation  (as a lesson OR play along) -- Shiko, Kakilambe, Hi-Life, Triplet

Sections 1, 2, & 3 are excellent resources to learn and practice with.  Sections 3, 4, & 5 are for the joy of drumming.  The play along sections feature Jim Donovan plus 3 other musicians playing djun djuns, iron bell, & another djembe.  This is nice because you could practice techniques on any of the instruments and play along with any of the four musical parts.  These are the sections I return to as an experienced drummer.

One highlight that is important to note about this DVD is the interesting camera angles.  The rhythmic ear training exercise features two views in splitscreen so you can see what Jim is playing from two directions.  One angle is a view of Jim as if you were sitting across from him in the room.  The other angle shows the drum head exactly as you would see your own drum (aka Jim's perspective, filmed from overhead).  You will realize the importance of this overhead angle if you have ever struggled to ""see"" or understand what another drummer is playing from across the room because it looks backwards.  Almost all of the features have this overhead view to help you to see the rhythms.

Jim's dialogue is both helpful and encouraging.  His pleasant personality is what makes Jim Donovan's drumming workshops (and this DVD) stand out from the crowd.",1324944000,,2146,4.697860962566845
8233468,1,B000YN1W96,"Lowest review rating I've ever given a product! As a musician, I've been excited to add percussion to my band & life. I've played guitar for over 40 years. In the last 10 years, I've amassed a library of over 75 instructional & performance videos - plus I've watched many others that I checked out of our local library & decided not to buy. I should have reviewed this one before buying it; I'm so disappointed. It should be free or very low priced, as it is more like a promo trailer to spark interest in drumming. I, frankly, got nothing useful out of it - information or technique. I also found it comparatively clumsy to navigate. The picture quality, sound quality, & camera angles are good. But it offers me nothing compared to the other percussion dvd's in my library and to some I watched but didn't buy. Like some others I didn't care for, it is an amaturish production.

To be honest, I bought it BECAUSE of the glowing reviews here. Now I must say that I'm very puzzled about the great desparity in all the reviews. It has no place in my personal library, so I plan to donate it to my local library. Maybe it will prove helpful to others. At least it won't cost them anything to watch it.",1301788800,5,1199,4.352678571428571
8233469,5,B000YN1W96,"Donovan has such a friendly, instructive style that I feel engaged and comfortable right away.  Having gone through a couple of the first lessons, I am looking forward to the rest of the course.  My research paid off!",1262131200,,217,4.684210526315789
8233470,5,B000YN1W96,"I find this DVD to be fun and instructive for a total newcomer to drumming.  I would laugh at some of his encouragements; he knows just what a new student is experiencing...'remember to breathe....drop your shoulders' and what to do if you lose the thread...'just keep going...smile, have fun...'  All this a new person needs, especially a grandmother who has never played drums before but always wanted to!",1261353600,2,407,4.970588235294118
8233471,4,B000YN1W96,"Jim Donovan is an excellent teacher, and the camera views (face-on and overhead, to see the hand movement on the drum) really help.  The only criticism I have is that the DVD is a bit confusing to negotiate from segment to segment.",1239235200,5,231,4.5
