7942315,5,B00005JXMD,"This is a DVD of vhs tapes released in the early eighties. The quality seems above home  vhs camcorders, I think a more professional vhs recorder was used than just a early camcorder. (It is not a recent DVD/blu Ray visual quality or high budget film). It was professionally filmed with multiple angles and editing and music. First segment is a 275 gtb4 and competition version .filmed from multiple angles including  wheels engine dash interior suspension trunk , driving on mulholland and owner interviews. 2nd segment : It shows a 1984 era Ferrari of Monterey event, with early f cars, and owner interviews, a little drive by filming . some significant cars like early racers,static  250 tr, static 250 gto, brief interviews with Phil hill and luigi chinetti  3rd segment with early racers , like static shots and owner interviews of cars like 250 swb 250lm, 512bblm.  Has shots of exterior. Engines dash seats suspension  wheels etc Think of this DVD as a vhs snapshot of being at a gathering of early ferraris in the early eighties.",1465603200,,1037,4.830508474576271
7942316,1,B00005JXMD,"The Ferrari name should not be on this video.  As another reviewer has said, I would have made a better documentary with my camcorder.  If you are a Ferrari fan, I know it is tempting to buy anything associated with this name.  Dont't do it.  STAY AWAY!",1009843200,15,253,4.319148936170213
7942317,2,B00005JXMD,"Is mere a basic copy of bad VHS quality on a DVD. Weird music, lazy interviews, bad camera shooting, ...
Only if you are a fan of Ferrari...but you should better buy the VHS video ""The World of Ferrari""...much more better.

7942318,1,B00005JXMD,"I ordered The Distinguished Racing Heritage of Porsche as well as 'Ferrari' by Brentwood Home Video. Once I viewed these DVDs I realized how Brentwood chose their name.
I would be ashamed to call these DVDs home videos. Their video quality is below that of most camcorders. The content is hokey and the music is reminiscent of porn movies of the 70's.
You've been warned!",998265600,40,371,4.723076923076923
