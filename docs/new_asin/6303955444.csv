8040989,4,6303955444,"We got this video probably in 2000.  It didn't get much use with my oldest child, as it's pure entertainment and I concentrated more on educational videos for her limited TV/video time.  I find I limit TV and videos even more now that I have 2 children (2 and 5), but try to do more of the education myself.  This is their current favorite!  Interestingly enough, it's Shawn's magic show attempts that capture their imagination the most and they now put on pretend magic shows with their hats, toys and mineral rock collection (""magic minerals"" - don't ask me how they came up with it) every evening with their daddy.  My older daughter even wants to put on her own show like the kids in the video.  My only question mark with this video is, what happened to ""Min's Flapper Song""?  There are references to it in the video, a picture of Min's face in her flapper costume on the back of the video and it's even listed in the songs/acts on the back of the box.  Such a mystery!",1101945600,,974,4.372222222222222

I like this  video though because it encourages children to express themselves, be  creative and use their talents.",965260800,6,251,4.9523809523809526
