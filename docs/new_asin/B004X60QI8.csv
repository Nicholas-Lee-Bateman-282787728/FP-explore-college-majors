It's an advanced lesson, but you can still use it if you're relatively new to jazz harmony - just start with the first segments and build logically from there. He presents two systems for constructing chord voicings on the guitar: drop-two and drop-three, starting with 6th chords, then explains how to use the two systems to construct other types of chords, concentrating on minor 6th, major 7th, and diminished. In the second half of the video he discusses diminished chords and their functions as passing chords in detail. He covers traditional diminished scales and then a major 6th diminished scale, which he harmonizes using the drop-two and drop-three voicings. He clarifies relationships between similar chords, e.g. 6th chord and the relative minor 7th, and the diminished chord and its realtionship to minor 7th b5 voicings. He plays examples of everything & includes all the chord voicings in a pdf file on the disc. The concepts are very applicable to solo and ensemble playing in mainstream jazz, ballads in the vein of the Great American Songbook, and Latin jazz. You can apply it to other styles, too, depending on how open you are to genre-bending.  A final word - this lesson will help your lead playing, too, since Roni explains close relationships between differently named chords and the scales that work with them. So, get this video if you want to improve your knowledge of jazz harmony - it's excellent stuff!",1317686400,14,1532,4.937984496124031
8446191,5,B004X60QI8,"Excellent lessons! Be SURE to use the Chordability PDF supplied on this DVD. It contains the detailed practice materials for the material covered on the DVD. Ben obviously put a lot of work into this DVD and book. Study it, practice it, and you'll get a lot out of it. Highly recommend Chordability and Ben's Talk Jazz Guitar book. Get both for the complete coverage (comping and improv) using the Barry Harris Method.",1516752000,,418,4.739726027397261

8446194,5,B004X60QI8,Great video. This is advanced material that will keep you busy for a while. Just getting the drop 2 chords down will be a tasks but well worth the time. Great explanation of drop two and three chords.,1499731200,,200,4.2894736842105265
8446195,5,B004X60QI8,"Excellent resource. Roni Ben Hur presents a full system of jazz guitar accompaniment and comping. Some of this material originated from Barry Harris' workshops, but its presented from a gigging guitar player's point of view. There is ALOT of useful information given here, and it comes with an ebook of supporting material with fingerings, which really comes in handy for shedding. Learn what is on this DVD and you are very well equipped as a jazz comper. This is not for beginners, I would recommend it for an intermediate jazz guitarist who is ready to get serious in his/her playing. One of the best I've seen.",1421020800,,614,4.80188679245283
8446196,5,B004X60QI8,"Loved this - will teach you a very practical method for using chords no matter what your level pf playing, although it is aimed at the intermediate to advanced guitarist. A practical system of using chords I had not seen before. Excellent value.",1416182400,,245,4.72093023255814

8446198,5,B004X60QI8,"Roni Ben-Hur knows how to present useable chord forms that you can use now. These chords are not the common ones used, which is great, because you don't sound like everyone else. He explains drop 2, 3, etc chords nicely. Useable chords can be found for Major, Minor, Dominant, or diminished in this DVD. Really great teacher, with his calm demeanor and the way he explains each clearly.",1394064000,,386,4.6911764705882355
8446199,5,B004X60QI8,"This DVD is is a nice organized introduction to a creative method of comping based on ideas developed by Barry Harris. I like how each lesson is short and to the point. Each lesson covers one idea and the lessons are sequenced in a logical manner that builds to create a complete method. It also comes with an excellent, well-formatted PDF book that is worth the price by itself. This book starts by teaching the basic concept of Drop 2 and Drop 3 voicings, something every jazz guitarist eventually must learn. The problem however with these voicings is that the student must learn 4 inversions of each of 6 chord qualities on two different sets of strings for each voicing type in 12 keys. That's A LOT of chord shapes AND there is little rhyme or reason to which inversion to use and jumping from one shape to another for a chord in comping really creates a static disconnected feel. The second half of this video introduces an alternate approach based on using only the M6 and min6 chord qualities of Drop 2 and Drop 3 as substitutes for any chord. This drastically cuts the number of chord shapes you use while at the same time increasing the colorations. The real beauty however is that one can create harmonized scales that use the 4 inversions of a 6th chord alternated with a diminished shape to create voice-led movement over a static chord. The end result is the guitarist relying on much fewer shapes, but getting more colorful sounds and creating interesting chord movement and resolution during comping. This a manageable system that allows the guitarist to create spontaneous creative arrangements in real time on the fly.",1389657600,3,1637,4.7272727272727275
8446200,5,B004X60QI8,"I too knew nothing of Roni or the ""Barry Harris Harmonic Concept"" until recently, but from the little that I've worked on so far, this may be the closet thing to a holy grail for guitarists yet.  Without going into too much detail, the overall concept is very easy to understand, apply, and execute....but the payoff is very deep.  I did not learn any new voicings really (I've been playing for over 20 years, so I'm no beginner) but what I did learn is how to view, combine, and use them in ways I had not thought of before.",1337817600,9,525,4.292929292929293
