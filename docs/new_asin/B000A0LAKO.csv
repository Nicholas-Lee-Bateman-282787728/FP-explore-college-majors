2347236,4,B000A0LAKO,"Need a brief old black & white film to cuddle up on the couch to? This is one you can add to the list!  A trifle of a classic but very sweet all the same.  Don't look for great film quality, here.  With melodramatic and typical period acting abound, somehow I was transfixed by the simple story of a boy making his way back to his family with the help of a washed up singer.  Bobby Breen's voice makes you wonder why there aren't numerous sound recordings of the wunderkind!  This being his first film, it is a must for fans to view!",1302912000,2,533,4.135922330097087
2347237,3,B000A0LAKO,"There are no pretensions toward cinematic greatness in evidence from the producers of this first of eight black and white RKO musicals that showcase the arresting eight year old boy soprano Bobby Breen, yet reception accorded it by an entertainment starved public that was grappling with the Great Depression was so laudatory that the succeeding seven works tended to concentrate more upon Breen rather than upon other cast members. Born in the Canadian province of Quebec, Bobby was fortunate in having his sister Sally recognize his innate talent, becoming his voice coach, and despite being somewhat isolated from most United States audiences, he began performing while only at the age of three years in a Toronto night club, committed to weekly appearances there for nearly two years as he burnished his coloratura, afterwards junketing, as a five year old show business veteran, south to Chicago, New York, and on to fame as a regular before live audiences upon Eddie Cantor's highly popular weekly radio program. In this film that initiated the series, Leon (George Houston) and Alice (Ann Doran) Alba are residing in Naples, Italy, in 1928, but Alice has wearied of their austere existence that is owed to her baritone husband's faltering operatic career, and she leaves him, taking along their infant son, returning to her native United States, where viewers will find the boy (Breen) eight years after, living in a Mapleton, Connecticut, orphanage since his mother has died and no one knows of his father's whereabouts. Two years after the youngster is placed at the orphanage, a circus, Carter's Travelling Theatre, visits Mapleton, and the lad, now called Billy Gordon, manages to escape in order to attend the troupe's performance, subsequently running with the Carter company, being looked after by a comedic performer, Joseph Pasquale (Henry Armetta), a once renowned operatic tenor who, although vocally washed up, instructs the runaway in the fine points of vocal technique to augment Billy's inherent skills. A married pair of Carter acrobats, Jim (Grant Withers) and Marge (Inez Courtney) Wilkins attempts to appropriate Billy's gift of song by legally adopting him. This expectedly creates a conflict with Pasquale and, to make the affair even more complicated, Billy's father Leon, now a widely recognized soloist touring throughout the United States, seeks assistance from ""The Missing Persons Bureau"" as he attempts to locate his long-lost son. Heavy cutting gives the work a quality of narrative compression resulting in a film having few memorable scenes or performances, although Houston and Breen effectively employ their material, the latter with renditions of Verdi's La donna  mobile from Rigoletto, the traditional Santa Lucia, and the title number, penned by Jimmy McHugh and Gus Kahn, while father and son separately and nicely sing a lullaby composed for the film by Hugo Riesenfeld. Direction is uneven and continuity at times glaringly substandard, but there is some sparse footage of routine circus activity that is realistically depicted. Withers gains the acting laurels here as a conniving acrobat. Digitally restored and reissued by Critics' Choice, LET'S SING AGAIN is coupled with RAINBOW ON THE RIVER, the second (and better) Breen film for a DVD version that unfortunately reverses the synopses of the two productions that are printed upon the DVD case.",1200096000,2,3397,5.29074074074074
2347238,5,B000A0LAKO,"You know, I never understood that phrase ""run off and join the circus"" until I saw this film. It seemed like a silly saying, but I guess it was movies like this that put the idea in people's mind. This is a funny sing-a-long  musical about a kid who runs off from home, joins the circus and finds out that he is a great singer. I liked the cirucs acts - the trampoline and the clowns more than the singing, but that is a matter of personal taste. It's a good quality print and the sound is better that most of this era.",1153094400,4,519,4.038834951456311
2347239,5,B000A0LAKO,"Working without any major stars and a low budget the filmakers of Let's Sing Again do a good job at making a musical aimed at kids.

As with most muscials the plot is simply an excuse to get the action moving. It's about a kid who runs off to join the circus and along the way learns to sing and dance and becomes a star.

You don't get a lot of preaching and the songs are very humable.",1146441600,,387,3.948717948717949

8071581,4,B000A0LAKO,"Good show for Breen, if you've never seen him worth a view. The boy can sing, and also not syrupy as a child actor. Don't want to be a spoiler so here's a synopsis without the resolution which is great. We're talking about Europe 1930's. Father is an opera singer, poor wage earner. Mother splits to USA with the little one, and subsequently dies. Kid is in an orphanage. Enamored about age 10 with a traveling carnival and hits it off with old Italian singer who is a carny worker. Kid runs away with the carnival, old Italian befriends him and finds out the kid can sing. Meanwhile orphanage is looking for kid. Unhappy carny worker wants to adopt kid and use him in a vaudeville act in Europe. Take him away from old carny friend. It doesn't happen but I can't give it away. Perhaps a little tear will be shed during the ending.",1445558400,,831,4.367741935483871

8071586,5,B000A0LAKO,I love this movie. It was so good that I had to watch it from beginning to end. I love the singing of Bobby Breen. Born in 1927 he has starred in some great films. I think you will love this movie if you like soprano singing from a boy. I've listed all of his movies I could find on the watch list. It is too bad that Hollywood does not showcase more movies using a boy with a soprano voice. I am sure there is a brilliant talent waiting to be recruited in this century of 2000. I love musicals like this. You will not be disappointed with hearing the golden voice of Bobby Breen.,1374364800,,580,4.008620689655173
