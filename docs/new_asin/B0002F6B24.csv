2090990,2,B0002F6B24,"With the weather being more like fall outside where I reside, I fell like watching horror films. I had this double feature laying around so I popped in the disc and away we go.

The Pit may be a cult classic to some, but I found it pretty boring. A young boy talks to a teddy bear and has a pit with hungry monsters in it. He kills all the people that is mean to him and accidentally kills his caretaker, who is was obessed with. The thing I don't understand is they start the movie with a scene that is in the middle of the film for no reason whatsoever. A very weird film and one i'd probably never watch again.

Hellgate was considered by most reviewers to be the worst of the lot. It features Horseshack from Welcome Back Kotter. It starts off with a vintage campfire with people telling ghost stories. It does start off pretty well but I fell asleep within the first twenty minutes. When I woke up, the movie was weird but looked good. It was very, very, very strange and I can see why people never talk about this film. I might try to watch it again because the last half hour was pretty unique.

Overall, The Pit was decent and watchable. Hellgate was very unique and strange but again its watchable at least once. For 80's horror films this scrape the bottom of the barrel. The price is right for the double feature and if you can get if for a good price used, then buy it.",1246665600,,1381,4.203773584905661
2090991,2,B0002F6B24,"I got this double feature from a guy at the flea market. All in all the movies are pretty dumb. I like the creatures in The Pit though. I also like how the boy was a little pervert. That was a nice touch. Another nice touch was how the boy got fed to the creatures at the end of the movie. So much for Yawn One.

The Hellgate is very bizzarre and dumb. I kept thinking about Carnival of Souls. One cool thing was that Horshack from Welcome Back Kotter was in this movie. What wasn't so cool was his nude scene. You really didn't see anything but I saw more than I cared to see. Mostly the movie is nonsensical. The movie tries to be surreal and comedic but it doesn't do a great job of either. The nude blonde was kinda entertaining. I'd give this movie the edge of the double feature simply because it felt like stuff was happening. In The Pit the so called plot just kept plodding along.

I can't say I'm a fan of this sort of stuff but it does have some entertainment value, not a lot mind you, but it was something to do on a slow evening. Overall though I was disappointed in this package.",1244332800,,1094,4.107476635514018
2090992,5,B0002F6B24,"I would love to know what committee at Anchor Bay Entertainment sits down and decides on what movies they will release and why.  With that being stated, this double movie feature from the horror vault of Anchor Bay is awesome.  There are two cult classics here that are both great for the horror/campy/strange/atypical lover in you!

The movies are as follows:

THE PIT (1981) is about a boy twelve years of age named Jamie Benjamin who looks like a younger version of Beck (two turn tables and a microphone).  It is safe to proclaim Jamie is a bit eccentric to say the very least.  Jamie is the victim of jokes and ridiculed by peers and adults.  Also he doesn't have any friends, except for his good pal Teddy, who just happens to be a ""Teddy Bear"".  Unlike other plush animals, Teddy is able to talk to Jamie via telepathy.  Teddy makes many suggestions to Jamie about how to ""approach things"" in life, the advice isn't always pro-social.  Jamie also knows about a strange pit in the woods near his house where four to five trolls live.  Jamie also has a strange obsession with sex, which he tries to display with his babysitter.  Once Jamie is pushed to his limit, which isn't that far of a trip, he figures out the perfect form of revenge for everyone that has ever made a fool out of him.

The Pit is hands down one of the most bizarre, peculiar, disturbing and creepy movies I have ever seen.  I wouldn't say it is scary, just weird and eerie.  It is all the elements together that make it so odd: trolls, talking teddy bear, Jamie's behaviors, ghosts, characters who almost seem moot and the jovial music played throughout the film that really doesn't fit.  The movie itself almost seems like a mixture of an after school special + Grimm's fairy tale + fable + rejects Muppets, no jiving.  This motion picture should be watched just for the ""I can't believe what I am watching aspect"".  Overall, The Pit is a cult classic that will make the viewer ask, ""Where did the inspiration for this come from""?

HELLGATE (1980) is about three friends telling ghost stories/legends in a log cable while they wait for their friend Matt.  The ghost story/legend that sticks out is about a tourist attraction town called Hellgate that closed down thirty years prior.  This happened when the owner of Hellgate (who is a diet John Astin) watched his daughter being murdered by a biker gang.  The legend states that this tourist attraction is now haunted and it is taboo to go there now.  Hellgate is only several miles from where the friends are staying.  Meanwhile, Matt is on his way to meet his friends when he sees an arcane and beautiful girl walking along the road named Josie.  The interesting factor is that Josie is the owner of Hellgate's daughter who was killed many years ago.  Josie has this Tori Amos thing going on about her and seems very pale when Matt picks her up in his car.  So Tori, I mean Josie brings Matt back to Hellgate and tries to lure him with sex.  To make a long story short, Matt leaves Hellgate without Josie and meets up with his friends.  Matt and his friends then go back to save Josie, rather Matt wants to and his friends are just there for the cheap thrill.  Will Matt and his friends make it out of the haunted town of Hellgate or not?  Will Josie come with them or not?  Is Tori, I mean Josie good or evil?

Hellgate is very cheesy and has a wonderful B movie quality about it.  I was laughing out loud at some of the special effects and loop holes in plot that were so big ""you can fly a spaceship through"".  There are zombies in this movie which is almost always a positive in any horror movie, in Hellgate it is definitely a good thing.  I wouldn't say this movie is scary, but there are some creepy moments due to some lighting and situations. The characters are all pretty much flat and one dimensional.  Consequently, that is alright since I was expecting anything wonderful in the ""character development"" department when I was watching this movie.  Overall, a nice little horror flick that gives you a bit of everything: zombies, blood, nudity, interesting scenery and a zombie turtle (don't ask).

The DVD itself is dual sided and the only special features are a poster/still gallery for THE PIT, there is no special features for HELLGATE.  Out of the two movies, THE PIT is definitely more unique, but HELLGATE will provide wonderful entertainment.  I found this to be a wonderful investment in the DVD department and see myself watching both of these movies again.  I am glad Anchor Bay is able to restore these lost gems and present them to a whole new generation of viewers.",1186358400,9,4620,4.536880290205563
2090993,5,B0002F6B24,I grew up with these movies when I was young if like campy chessy type of bhorror this is for you.,1175126400,,98,3.7142857142857144
2090994,4,B0002F6B24,"Once upon a time, a young (but rapidly aging, sadly) schlock film lover by the name of Jeff Leach discovered DVD. And life was good. Then Jeff discovered discs released by an entity named MGM that contained two cheesefests on a single DVD. And life was better. One day, while Jeff rubbed his hands together and cackled with glee over the idea that he could watch two pictures with Shelley Winters--""What's the Matter with Helen?"" and ""Whoever Slew Auntie Roo?"" as an example--in a single day, he heard a voice come down from on high. The voice said in commanding tones, ""You have done well with this discovery, but there is another truth. Go forth and find the double feature Anchor Bay discs. If you thought MGM's discs were schlocky, you haven't seen anything yet."" Jeff wondered at what he had heard. He went forth into the world to find these marvels, suspecting that perhaps the voice was mistaken. What was this madness called Anchor Bay? Who dared attempt to match the marvels wrought by MGM? Infidels! Yet the truth the voice spoke of was exactly that, truth, and Jeff discovered these fabled discs. The truth shall set you free!

Free to have your mind filled with images of pure schlock, that is! ""The Pit"" and ""Hellgate"" do indeed fill a single disc in Anchor Bay's ""Drive In"" DVD series. Two films. Three plus hours of cheese. Here we go!

""The Pit,"" certainly one of the weirdest films to grace the silver screen, stars helmet haired Sammy Snyders as Jamie Benjamin, a supremely troubled pre-teen who has made a most interesting discovery out in the woods. A pit exists, you see, a pit that contains odd little troll shaped creatures with a hunger for meat. When we first meet up with Jamie, we see him pushing a bully into the pit. Then we get the backstory. Jamie is a problem child, a real weirdo that his teachers and neighbors view with suspicion and alarm. Even his parents worry about him. It makes sense. Jamie carries on conversations with his teddy bear, owns a bunch of slithery reptiles, and has an obsession with girls that would make a porn addict sit up and take notice. Watch what he does to his sultry school librarian in the hope of getting a few cheesecake snapshots! Sick, I tell you, sick! Then there is the attention Jamie heaps on his babysitter Sandy O'Reilly (Jeannie Elias). He watches her while she sleeps, asks really disturbing questions, and leaves messages on the mirror in the bathroom while she takes a shower. Paging David Berkowitz!

Flip the disc over and watch ""Hellgate,"" a movie that greatly disappoints when compared to the wacky weirdness of ""The Pit."" Note to self: when you've sunk to watching horror films starring Ron Palillo of ""Welcome Back, Kotter"" fame, it's time to hang up the remote. Yes, ""Hellgate"" stars Horshack as Matt, a graduate student who stumbles over a horrible little amusement park type town with a few of his brain dead friends. What happens? Oh, not much. The owner of the park found some magical crystal that initially turns goldfish into exploding monstrosities, but he manages to master the power of this object and thus resurrect his dead daughter Josie (Abigail Wolcott). His daughter then haunts the roads around the town, luring in travelers for a little bit of lovin' and a whole lotta dyin'! Course, she didn't count on meeting up and falling in love with the hunk o' burnin' love that is Ron Palillo! This unexpected romance leads to all sorts of nonsense, some of which actually involves a bit of violence, but the movie mostly tries to play for laughs. Watch for the hoofers shaking their skirts in the dancehall! Watch for ham-fisted acting and dumb dialogue! Watch that dude spend half the film sharpening objects to challenge the owner of Hellgate only to die immediately when he shows up to do battle!

""The Pit"" is by far the better picture on the disc. Snyders is an odd duck made all the odder by a script obviously written by someone who took the brown blotter at Woodstock. We get a little girl calling Jamie a ""funny person"" not once but twice, meat, a teddy bear that commands the living to kill, and some serious gore when the troll like creatures go on a killing spree! Wait, there's more! We get an old lady in a wheelchair dumped in the pit! We get Sandy's boyfriend falling into the pit as though he couldn't possibly have seen a hole in the ground the size of Australia! We get a conclusion taken straight out of the Twilight Zone! Oh yeah! Schlockfest central here, folks! How could a lame movie like ""Hellgate"" compare with such a film? Easy--it can't. Placing these two films side by side is like comparing the intellectual powers of Anna Nicole Smith and Stephen Hawking. Can't be done.

Anchor Bay does a nice job with both movies in terms of picture quality. Both are in widescreen. While no one expects anything on these double feature discs in the extras department, we do get a poster and still gallery on ""The Pit."" We get nothing in the way of extras for ""Hellgate"" unless you count the heartache you'll carry with you for days afterwards. After watching the disc, I began wondering about that voice I heard telling me to go and find this DVD. Was it the voice of the Supreme Being, or the voice of Jamie's teddy bear? I'm not sure, but I've got a sudden craving to lure my enemies into a forest in the hopes that I'll find a pit there...",1129334400,21,5357,4.605235602094241
2090995,3,B0002F6B24,"I agree, seeing The Pit again as an adult, you do see David Lynch like references. I found it to be a bit more humorous than others did, watching how Jamie leads victims to the Pit.

I found it enjoyable as I actually grew up in the town where this was filmed, seeing your friends and neighbors in the movie was a blast! Jamie could have been the kid I babysat for very easily! Glad to find this movie on DVD!",1125014400,3,409,4.049382716049383
2090996,3,B0002F6B24,"The Pit is an odd black-horror comedy that feels like a David Lynch movie mixed with a goosebump episode with a little boy named Jamie Benjamin who has an obsession with sex and then befriends a group of monsters called Trogs that eat people and then for revenge he feeds them the neighborhood bullies and even his babysitter. The Pit is filmed in Wisconsin on a low-budget with an unknown cast. This is not a kids movie because of the violence and nudity.

Hellgate is a waste of time with Ron Palillo(Horseshack from Welcome Back Kotter)visting a ghost town and battling zombie-like creatures. They should have put The Pit with a better movie.",1109116800,6,645,4.707964601769912

2090998,5,B0002F6B24,"""The Pit"" is a 1981 Canadian-American horror drama about an odd 12 year old boy named ""Jamie"" whom is picked on at school, has a obessesion with women including nude ones, he has a collection of reptiles and his only buddy is a teddy bear that speaks to him telepathically. He is also the only one who knows about a hole in the forest that contains prehistoric hairy monsters called "" Trologs"" that only feed on flesh, he is a friend to the creatures but doesn't have enough money on buying more meat for them, Teddy does tell him to feed them only the bad people that tormented him yet he does as people are mysteriously disappearing and the Tralalogs are getting out to feast on people. It's a strange David Lynch-like thriller with morals, interesting ideas, cool monsters, a demonic teddy bear and it's a great underrated revenge movie in the vein of "" The Shining"" and 1978's ""Magic"".

Then secondly "" Hellgate"" which is not bad actually but an enjoyable low-budget supernatural horror romp about an old ghost town inhabited by a evil spirits and zombies including a beautiful young lady that lures traveling males to the town only to suffer death. It does have some cool zombies, Dead Heat( 1988) style zombie animals, explosions, and nudity abound.

This double-feature from Anchor Bay is quite great with nice picture and sound quality, even though the only extra is the ""poster and still gallery"" for "" The Pit"".

Highly recommended movies to horror fans!",1100649600,18,1464,4.733333333333333
2090999,4,B0002F6B24,"ok, seen the pit back in the 80's on regular t.v. cut. didn't really care for it then. Now i got the new dvd and gave it another mature chance, and the result is intresting.

First off, the pit was filmed in september thru october of 1979, and it shows. The film also deals with some realistic issues such as, bad parenting, mean adults, bullying, and a hint of child molestation. The film is intresting. The movie goes bad once the babysitter dies. then it goes in another goofy direction and flat out sucks. But the first hour is cool.  Now on the transfer of the dvd is pretty good, colors look a little washed. but the picture is clean .. the audio is good enough.. check it out.

there is however one phony thing, everytime someone is thrown into the pit and devoured by the little monsters , no one screams!!!! except the babysitter. but 4 people before her don't scream, at least scream, the director needed to fix this and it would be more frightening and real..  Also, the babysitter has a boyfriend but she two times with his friend, which makes her look shady, after acting to goodie goodie. But this shows she isn't perfect and has a little sneaky side..",1100131200,3,1166,4.434579439252336

First, a disclaimer. Hellgate is, in a word, idiotic. Just wretchedly awful. Yet, there are so many wonderfully ""WTF?"" moments that the thing is never boring and, for those so inclined, highly entertaining throughout! I won't even bother trying to piece together or summarize the plot; nope, you're on your own here, compadre. This movie very aptly and fittingly resides in the ""so bad its good"" camp of cinematic curiosities (atrocities?).

8027664,4,B0002F6B24,"THE PIT
Sammy Snyder plays a 12-year old boy (he certainly doesn't look like he's 12) who's basically a pervert who spies on his babysitter. He talks to his teddy bear who actually might be alive and visits a deep hole in the forest that contains some ancient creatures that are still trapped at the bottom. Later, he begins to lure his enemies into the hole for the creatures to eat. However, you don't see any gore until after 70 minutes into the film when it then begins to show you some stuff. Although the pit is so large and noticeable, Snyder simply makes a guy back up and fall in the pit by tossing him a football, and another scene is even more absurd: he just waits on the other side of the pit and a young child just walks right into it like it's completely unnoticeable! I don't know if this 12-year old pervert thing was meant to be disturbing, but it just comes off as laughable with Snyder's performance; he's now into dancing and has a website and isn't acting anymore. The films tone sometimes switches to comedic; I would've preferred a serious tone throughout. It has some topless scenes, and it shouldn't have waited so long into the film to show some gore; it would've been far better if they just made it really gory throughout. The locations where they filmed it are OK, but it doesn't really have effective atmosphere. Aside from Snyder's performance, the other elements of comedy that are thrown in hurt the film. Nevertheless, there isn't anything quite like this film and it's memorable.

The quality is very good, and it has a short photo gallery. This definitely needs a Blu-ray release with more extras and a new transfer. I want a commentary with this film. Hopefully, either some place like Shout Factory or Code Red can give this a proper Blu-ray release.

HELLGATE
This one is about a ghost town and a magic crystal. Although it isn't a horror comedy, it contains some unnecessary and unfunny comedy bits that hurt the film. There's a pretty good amount of nudity in this one but no full frontal. It also has a decent amount of gore and some of this stuff was good, but there isn't anything extreme. The atmosphere and locations aren't bad but are nothing special. The pace on this is pretty good, but the directing is just fair. This isn't what you would call a memorable film; it's just an 80s horror flick with a nice 80s feel and is fun.

The quality is very good. This also needs a Blu-ray release with extras. This is one of the more forgotten 80s horror films, and I want some interviews and a commentary with it.

8027666,3,B0002F6B24,"This review is for ""The Pit"" only:

Being a fan of both horror and grindhouse films, I've seen more than my share of strange movies. And while I won't go so far as to say ""The Pit"" tops them all, it is certainly high up the totem pole of weirdness.

The story revolves around a young boy named Jamie (played by Sammy Snyders), who is an odd sort of kid. Ostracized by the other kids, and even some of the adults, because of his unusual behavior, he finds friendship with his teddy bear (who speaks to him) and a small group of creatures that dwell in a nearby pit. But when he finds out what their diet consists of, all those who haven't been nice to Jamie end up finding themselves on the menu!

Almost from the start, the film has a very eerie and creepy tone to it. Jamie's erratic behavior tells you there is something not quite right here. Sammy Snyders really does a superlative job in portraying Jamie as a strange outsider. He's alone in his own little world and he has no problem with it at all. It's all the ""normal people"" who bug him. But when his crush on the babysitter, Sandy (played by Jeannie Elias), is threatened by her seeing him as just a kid and wanting to be with other men, eerie takes a turn into the outlandish. Unfortunately, how that is presented to us isn't always on an even keel. Jamie's luring his ""foes"" to the pit to feed them to his ""friends,"" ranges from the scary (like what he does to the bully and his girlfriend) to the unintentionally hilarious (like how he handles the blind woman in a wheelchair). But for the first two acts, things remain coherent an entertaining, even if a bit rough in the execution. But at the end of the second act, with the death of Sandy, things go completely off the rails.

The last act of the film is almost a hodgepodge of situations, that often don't show how they are connected or even make much sense. The police investigating the disappearance of those Jamie has fed to the trolls, is absolutely ridiculous. To call it ""keystone cops work,"" would be to insult incompetent police. Then, Jamie lets the creatures loose, but they don't go far or do very much. The mass slaughter of them is very anti-climactic, to say the least. And the end, where Jamie goes to live with his grandparents and we see his ultimate fate, just comes completely out of left field. What happened to his parents? Why didn't he move with them to Seattle? Was ""Teddy's"" voice only in Jamie's head or was there something else at work? And how many other pits full of these creatures are there? All questions to which we never get the answers. It's like the director just didn't know how to end it, so they just filled the last 20-25 minutes with pointless scenes that go nowhere and have no rhyme or reason. It drags down the film's enjoyment a bit and leaves you with a less than satisfying feeling, even though the rest of it has been interesting and entertaining.

As I said, ""The Pit"" is certainly among one of the most peculiar films I've seen, if not the most peculiar. And while the final act is a cluttered and disappointing jumble, the film's first two acts are engaging and it does keep you entertained throughout its 97 minute run time (something you can't say about many other ""normal"" horror films). I'd mildly recommend this for horror fans looking for a less-than-usual experience, due to its off-the-wall style and format. It is certainly one of the most unique specimens in the annals of horror cinema, that I have ever come across.",1393632000,2,3495,4.471786833855799
8027667,4,B0002F6B24,"You can read about Stuart's problems with his script being changed by the producers here on the good ole Internet, but overall I didn't find the movie to be THAT bad. I enjoyed it on a goofy, not terribly critical level. The performances are fairly good, and the creature effects, while amateurish, are sort of comical, and I feel this helps this little movie. I mean, c'mon, we can't take it THAT seriously, and on that level, it works! It's not everyone's type of story, but ""The Pit"" is blackly humorous and unusual, and that goes a long way for me, as it never really stoops to slasher movie or monster movie clichs. It is, albeit, rather hastily resolved, with a twist ending that is superfluous--I mean, really, what are the odds that the little girl has...oh never mind.
""Hellgate"" has been termed unwatchable by some reviewers here, but I don't know that that's entirely true. Oh sure, it's silly, but it's not worse than ""The Outing"", another 80's offering that could have used some script supervision!
Overall, this DVD set is nice, collectible, with an insert, trailers, and quality prints of these two films with good sound on both.

HELLGATE follows a group of friends that are lured into a cursed ghost town by a mysterious woman in white. It isn't long before the town's ghostly inhabitants set in on the intruders. For some inexplicable reason, the dialog is all read phonetically, with every syllable being pronounced in a series of incredibly unnatural performances. Scenes are hilarious when they shouldn't be, and terribly unfunny where they should be. Watching the film on mute may actually have made for a more rewarding viewing experience, where the imagination could make up for the poor writing. On top of everything else, HELLGATE boasts the most unattractive cast this side of MADMAN. The only remotely positive aspects of the film involve some of the most random gore ever filmed (including a mutant zombie turtle) and a series of surreal dream-like sequences in the ghost town that recall the Horror classic CARNIVAL OF SOULS. A sad, pathetic CARNIVAL OF SOULS. HELLGATE is just plain terrible film making at its worst, and isn't even bad enough to be enjoyed with friends.
