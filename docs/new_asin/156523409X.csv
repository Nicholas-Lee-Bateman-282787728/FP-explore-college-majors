7796476,5,156523409X,This book inspired me to build an Oval Chuck. It give enough information to make an unbalanced chuck to do limited turning of Oval Boxes and Picture frames. I have Emailed David about his Lathe and the lathe I am building. IL did add a Balance system to the chuck to keep vibration down. GREAT BOOK! if you are interested in Oval turning,1390953600,,337,4.365079365079365
