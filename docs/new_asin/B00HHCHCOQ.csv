8632719,1,B00HHCHCOQ,"I watched this on Drama Fever, I did not buy or watch the DVD and have no information on the video or subtitle quality of the one listed here. I'm only reviewing the movie itself. I love Kim Jae Joong as an actor and have been waiting to see this movie. After all, he's a good actor. The plot of the movie is the police are looking to prevent a murder by the Jackal. So they camp out at a hotel and are continually charged for damages the hotel incurred. Kim Jae Joong's character is a singer who someone put a hit on. There are supposed to be funny scenes of him like when he was tied to a chair. There was also a bed scene of him tied to a bed and hit with something while the police look on saying that is nothing unusual. There was a stalker fan too.  He actually makes a deal with the woman who turns out to be the Jackal to help him as she had killed someone else. She goes free. And he wants her to kill someone at the end and she threatens him. This movie is really bad. If you want to see his chest then that's something you can see. He's such a talented actor and I'm sad to see him in such a badly scripted movie. It doesn't make sense at all. I only continued to watch it to the end because I respect the actor. I rate this on my scale of badness, the American movie Cloverfield is the worst movie I've wasted my time on and this is the second worst now. Feel free to watch it and make your own judgement on it.",1526774400,,1423,3.9409722222222223
