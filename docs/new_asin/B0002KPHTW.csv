2100097,4,B0002KPHTW,"While not Lars von Trier's first feature film, Epidemic is the earliest of his films to be released to DVD and it's a powerful piece of work that blasts wide open the conventions of film--even modern (i.e., as of 1987, when this film was released) ones.

The title refers to a script that Lars and Niels Vorsel are in the process of writing during the film itself, after their first collaborative script, The Cop and the Whore, gets accidentally trashed in a PC crash.

Some interesting markers on the film:

1.  shot in black and white

2.  the title of the film is shown in red letters with a trademark symbol throughout the entire course of the film in the upper left corner

As these two develop their story, scenes alternate between the two of them--with their friends and acquaintances--and scenes they envision from the film Epidemic.  In the film within a film, Lars plays Dr. Mesmer, whose name, of course, evokes that of the famed 19th century hypnotist, but the character is 20th century; in one scene, we see him suspended from a helicopter.  Also in the film within a film is an American black priest.  The language of the entire film alternates between English and Danish; the priest speaks English and in one wacky scene, Niels reads a letter from an American teenage girl penpal in English, based on his deciding to have some ""fun"" (if that's what it could be called) by spoofing pen pal correspondence, writing to 70 teenage American girls and pretending to be a Danish teenaged boy.

If this sounds disjointed, from one perspective, it is that, yes.  But what it also does is to establish a jarring juxtaposition of mundane day to day life with the horrific story the two filmmakers are developing.  The priest, for example, is consumed with fear about which he is mortally ashamed--fear of the plague epidemic that is spreading like wildfire across Europe--and voices that fear and shame in alternating whispered speech and anguished screaming, as he himself succumbs.

Why did von Trier pick Mesmer as the name of the latter-day doctor in the film within a film?  This relates to the last scene in the film itself which is a real shocker and will not be revealed here.  This last scene brings to a boil all the elements previously presented, including a short stay in the hospital for Neils who undergoes minor surgery to remove some undesirable growths.

What makes this film so powerful, among other things, is how easily von Trier plays with reality and fiction.  We know that Lars and Neils are the real names of the people playing these characters, as is true of all the other characters who appear in the scenes with Lars and Neils.  We know that Lars has a strong and morbid fascination with things medical, and this is reflected both in his interests expressed in the film itself, and his portrayal of Dr. Mesmer in the film within a film.  And, subtly, we know that Lars and Neils' perspective embraces more than just Denmark, but other parts of Europe--France (love of wine), Germany (a side trip in one scene), and other countries--as well as the U.S.  Any conjuring up of an epidemic has to imply a huge territory of possible infection; with the references to several other countries, von Trier is saying that this infection is really modern life itself which gives us the ability to appreciate sensory experience but not much else. And which spreads, plaguelike, to all, regardless of name, nationality, position, occupation, self-image.

Maybe this last statement is pompous; maybe not.  In spite of the potentially annoying ever-present logo in the upper left corner of the screen, this is a film that uses the intellect to deliver a one-two punch to most of your cinematic expectations.  And watch out for the ending; it will leave you breathless (no reference to Godard here, just an observation).

Highly recommended.",1107993600,14,3855,4.795763993948563
8028388,4,B0002KPHTW,"Before the Danish film director Lars von Trier got his worldwide success with The Kingdom and his marvelous Breaking the Waves, he made a trilogy called The trilogy of Europe. Movies whose titles start with the letter E and dealt with the traumas of Europe. Past, present, and possible future. And in the eighties, with the Cold War and fear of attack, there came the panic of imminent death from a nuclear apocalypse. Something that medicine could not cure. And with the apparition of AIDS in the worldwide language, death through an incurable illness could be an unpleasant possibility. So with this film, Lars von Trier and his co-writer Niels Vorls attempt to dive into that subject matter. That is a plague epidemic that spreads through Denmark, Germany, Europe, and, as a possibility, the world. Catastrophe scenario that, in Hollywood, would involve lots of death, guts, and gore. The kind of script you'd see in a zombie film like Night of the Living Dead.

Unfortunately for fans of that horror genre, this is not what happens in Epidemic.

In it, Lars and Niels, playing their own roles as writers, try to summon a new script that they want to present to a Danish Film Institute Executive producer. Abandoning their former detective story with a cop and a prostitute (small nod to Element of Crime!), their new project revolves around a bubonic plague epidemic. Reminder of a crucial past in Europe's medieval history, Epidemic's title appears on the screen the minute the characters start writing their work. Half-diving into scenes from the script then going back to the authors' ups-and-downs trying to write it, the movie happens through this back-and-forth as chapters, an upcoming feature for Lars's future films, appear on the screen. Titles for the days of writing until the eventful meeting, their presence make us dread the dramatic conclusion the movie's narrator warns us about at the beginning. A dramatic irony that the characters are unaware of except us and which epitomizes the thematic of this film. The coincidences between fiction and reality when they blur together and how, when tragedies we take for granted as fictional or of the past do occur, the possibility of escape becomes impossible.

Unlike Element of Crime, whose human interactions were disjointed, confusing, and cold, I preferred Epidemic. Stronger presence of human interactions, emotions, and drama, the story's easier to connect to. This is a movie that presents the reality of scriptwriting, that is the friendship and complicity between scriptwriters as they try to organize their plotline. Speaking of plotlines, it's interesting to see Niels and Lars painting on the apartment's wall their plot's progression because that is what Lars also does in his Zentropa office. A fact that further strengthens the blur between reality and fiction with this film.

At times, the movie fluctuates like a dialogue. With digressions going on subjects like Niels correspondences with American girls to the actor Udo they meet in Cologne and listen to his grief over his mother's death and, as I was happy to see, his condemnation of the racist belief surrounding Germans that they are all Nazis. Which too many people still believe even today and which we got a troubling example through the British reporter Kate Muir from The Times of London who, during Lars's Melancholia press conference (still available on Cannes's website and which I watched in May 2011 the day it happened), dove in right after Charlotte Higgins's (The Guardian) intervention about ""Tristan und Isolde"" and attacked Lars with this question:
""Kate Muir from the Times of London. My question follows on from the German Romantic thing. Can you talk a bit about your German roots and the Gothic aspect of this film. (Lars:gossip?) And also, you mentioned in a Danish Film Magazine also about your interest in the Nazi Aesthetic and you talked about that, German roots, at the same time. Can you tell us a bit more about that?"" (Cannes Melancholia Press Conference 2011, 34:30 to 34:57)
A wordy question that insinuated a sick display of germanophobia as she connected together his taste for the Nazi culture with his ""German roots"", that is his secret biological father's blood: the German Fritz Michael Hartmann who, when Lars met him, NEVER recognized him as his son and NEVER had any influence in Lars's life and art. A filthy ""personal taste-blood"" connection she accused Lars of doing during his interview for a Danish film Magazine she never took the time/decency/professionalism to identify in her question at Cannes, but later revealed as the Danish Film Institute Magazine Film #72 in her May 20th 2011 article ""No let-off this time for the enfant terrible after ""Nazi"" rant"". Article that she wrote as an excuse for asking her sick blood-racist question and where she has the nerve of twisting the words Lars used to describe Inger Hst's (his mother) deathbed revelation about his biological father being Hartmann rather than Ulf Trier  fact every fan of Lars von Trier knows and which every biography describes and which any common film critic should know regarding Lars as it's the central pillar of his cinema  to state instead that he was talking about his mother being a German. Inaccurate reporting that proves her quill is as much as a ""quick-quotes"" as her accusation that Lars spoke about his German blood and his taste for the Nazi culture TOGETHER as they were instead mentioned in complete different contexts during the Danish Film Institute Interview. That is his secret biological father during an enumeration of his passion for Nietzsche and his current reading of Thomas Mann to show the irony that his whole life (artistic and private) has revolved around Germany; while for his taste for the Nazi culture in another context where he was describing his opinion that the Nazis' Stuka's artistic design was more impressive and memorable than the British's Spitfire. Artistic belief, not ideological, that I strongly suspect is the real ""root"" of Kate Muir's attack on Lars as the UK has extreme pride and nostalgia over its military history  especially for World War 2  and Lars's artistic opinion could be seen, for many British people, as a ""whole spiel"" which was how she described his Nazi aesthetic interest in her May 20 2011 article I wrote about earlier.
In the end, her question and accusation at Cannes had the result of making Lars uncomfortable  as he was Jewish but not practicing, as his family is raised under that culture (ex:children' names) just like he was by his parents as a child  and made him reply with sarcastic Danish and Jewish jokes (badly formulated and without a punch because of that stressful situation he did not expect and which made him nervous) where he was trying to pinpoint out the germanophobic nature of her question that implied that ""German equals Nazi"" and how her question hurt/insulted his Jewish background and faith his parents raised him in, his denunciation of the holocaust in his Europa film, and his interest that he had years before knowing the truth about his biological father. A reply which reporters/artists didn't understand, or knew but did not want to admit, or heard but instead wrote/stated the opposite in complete bad faith to up their sales and images like the Rita Skeeters they behaved that day. A situation that infuriated people in the public I spoke with and other fans like me as we saw the conference on Cannes's website, on YouTube, and clearly reported on blogs and other websites detailing the affair; condemning the reporter for what had happened that day as Melancholia's conference was going well before her confrontational intervention-question, had none of the lousy atmosphere Lars suffered in other Cannes years (ie: Antichrist), and that her sudden question as the second-to-last reporter didn't allow a proper comeback for what had just happened. Ending the conference on a sour note that made fans and people in the public I spoke with (ex: Film Institute employees, University students, shop employees, etc.) think that Cannes should have sacked ""her"" and not Lars and that the moderator should have intervened and confronted the reporter over her statement and its racist insinuations; ordering her to either specify what she wants, or retract, or reformulate, or pass the mike to someone who has something intelligent to ask. In short, the large majority of the Public and of the Web demonstrated a sympathy and defensive support towards Lars which must have infuriated Kate Muir as she wrote in September 30 2011 a headmistress editorial subtly entitled ""Stop indulging Lars von Trier and his grotesque stunts"" that proved she did not expect that reaction-and-devotion for Lars from the public and his fans. Although it reveals the cunning/spiteful/two-faced nature she revealed in her articles and which contrasted with her behaviour at Cannes where she had asked her question with a candid and over-kindness/gallantry that I had instantly recognized as phony because it wasn't natural and honest, making me therefore not trust that journalist at all and extremely suspicious of her as she spoke. Not only that, a friend felt that the reporter's behaviour at Cannes made that woman, along with her racist question, more dumb than intelligent as she described Kate Muir as a ""C-four-letters-curse-word"" that I will not write, but which I quite agree with. Again everything that I just mentioned in this paragraph is an opinion of mine on this whole incident that had an impact on Lars's filmography like the movie Nymphomaniac, but it is an opinion which many family members, co-workers, friends, shop employees, and people I met on the street strongly believe and share with me. In conclusion, this scandal is an event that pinpoints to the kind of prejudice Lars mentions in Epidemic, which he would end up being a victim of, as his movie forewarns that even decades after the end of the War and in the 21st century, there will still be people who think all Germans and those with German blood are Nazis.

As for the technical aspects of this film, Lars is again a master at work. Strong black-and-white as in Night of the Living Dead, delicious lighting, well induced sound effects, and soundtracks with Tanhausser's overture, the movie's machine is perfect. Nothing to reproach at. Nothing clunky for our eyes and ears.

However the restraint in some of the performances makes the film a bit more difficult to appreciate it. Indeed, Lars and Niels sometimes are very timid in their way of acting out their scenes. Though of course, that restraint might be to make their performances more real rather than theatrical, the way the movie presents their feelings makes it a bit more colder than necessary. And of the cast members that do release that energy, Udo Kier and the medium's wife add pain and sadness. Emotions that enrich this film some might find too cold for the dramatic tension in this film. But which the climax explodes toward us.

As for the sound, it is in mono and the definition is, even though not in HD, very enjoyable on a HD TV screen. In particular for a large one.
In the end, this movie is, although better than Element of Crime, still more restrained than necessary and I think that it could have had more humanity in the story. Nevertheless, a fine rendition in Lars's filmography that displays future elements in Lars's works. Which are Hand-held cameras, Wagner soundtracks, the Kingdom hospital, and an apocalypse, and main characters that are self-portrayals of him. Like how Madame Bovary is Gustave Flaubert.",1449964800,,11619,5.0046559751681325
8028389,4,B0002KPHTW,"Everything gas to be minimal, and minimal is everything. Black and white of course. Minimal camera, film, format, special effects, if any. Everything has to be really happening the way you see it, or nearly that way. Because the end is not exactly that really real and realistic.

A virus destroys the scenario that was on a floppy disk of one of those first text processors from before GUIs and PCs. So Lars and Niels have five days to produce a scenario and they are no longer interested by the one they have just lost, The cop and the whore, which would have been a remake of Element of Crime. So they start a new scenario from scratch in five days or so. I guess the virus got into them like a gremlin into some computer and they decide to get into the description of some epidemic in modern times.

The details are not really interesting. What is important is the treatment of the subject. If you have to only show real images and situations, how can you show a modern plague on the model of Milano under attack from the Black Death in 1348, bricking up in their houses the families that were infected for them to die inside their houses and not contaminate the others. Pure egotistic selfish absurdity anyway. Those viruses were transported by rats that do not know what bricks are and they can always go through if necessary, and they were probably already out. And the virus is like Father Christmas: it can go up and down chimneys.

Then they can go in archive underground with walls totally infected with some saltpeter like ulmcers in the plaster popping up regularly. That looks like some plague too. And then they get some facts that are told about this old plague. And if you cannot really show the new modern plague, at least you can show the scenario writers writing their scenario. And you can get into their minds and listen to what they see in their minds eye, how they see the film, the characters, etc. So there are a few cameos about that fictitious plot that ends in the most absurd way, but youll have to discover it yourself.

To add some modern realistic flavor they have one man telling what his mother told him about the way a whole set of people were parked or packed in some hole full of water and made to die slowly by the Nazis. We can believe that, in fact we can believe any horror about the Nazis. So no problem and we have seen so many images of these horrible events that we can put such pictures on the words. The film is only showing the self-imposed torture of the man telling what his mother had told him just before dying.

And we can also send the two scenario writers on a quick trip to Germany and have some infernal vision of cables, highways, tunnels, and all those means of transportation that would be the best vectors for any epidemic in modern times. Our cars are modern rats in a way. And I will say nothing about buses, trains, planes, and what the Canadians call char--bancs.

And that is what Lars von Trier is doing all the time, shifting us from any period of time and any place to any other period of time and any other place. He even includes a pathology department in some hospital and a dissection to reveal some glandular tissue change, small little pea-looking globules that develop no one knows why and how. Fifteen cases yesterday, mind you. Once again we are in for a sance of grossing out. But the final one is a champion in the genre, in the style, in the ambition to make us sick.

Lars von Trier uses a trick he has already used in Element of Crime and that is hypnosis. If you cannot take the producer of the film who is on a quick visit to Denmark to the plague itself evoked in the 12 page scenario, or rather sketch, you can bring a woman (of course it has to be woman, don't ask me why, but it has to be a woman) who is hypnotized by a man (and it has to be a man here too, don't ask me why but it has to be a man) and she is thus projected into the epidemic film and she describes the epidemic, what she sees, to the point of catching the disease, though it happens to her after it had happened to the first scenario writer, probably Lars if it is not Niels, and she develops, like him on his arm, ulcers on her neck and she gets crazy and she punctures the ulcers with a fork and she kills herself. Hows that as for a demonstration of the power of the plague, of the film seen as a contagious and killing fatal lethal deadly epidemic?

Altogether I am still not convinced as for that film technique that illustrates a famous manifesto cosigned by Lars von Trier and Thomas Vinterberg, Dogme 95 and the Vow of Chastity. But what I am becoming convinced of is that if you try to only give true real material facts on the screen, you are spreading around the matter necessary to psychoanalyze you, which I hate. So I won't try to see how sick Lars von Trier is. But one thing is sure. That film technique is revealing the tremendous guilt some have in their mind and conscience. All beautiful stories, love stories and adventures, action films and horror films based on nothing but science fiction and special effects, utopia and dystopia, all that produces an audience that is blas, that does not believe in anything any more and that does not even know reality is really horrible, provided you accept to look at it instead of all the fictional depictions of it that only suspend your disbelief fifteen minutes and then let you go on living in the dreamlike reality you imagine you are all the time blind and deaf to any horror, mute of course like a dumb thumb when you should shriek and yell, howl and protest.

Leonard Cohen got it right right: I am blind, don't pass me by. But the audience is blind and it is them, every single member of that audience who passes by the real horror and does not see it because they have been made blind to it by the cinema of the cinema industry in Hollywood, Bollywood and Saint Denis.

But does Lars von Trier make us able again to see the real reality of our real modern world? I am not sure because the body, the flesh, the blood and adrenalin matter we are transporting on our bones and feet, is not more able to see horror than this blind audience Lars von Trier is speaking of, because we do not see with our eyes only, with our body only, because we see first of all with our mind, and minimalist films like this one do not make us think one iota more than Star Trek or Star Wars. And some people would disagree with what I have just said. And I might not disagree with them.

The switch from 16mm grainy footage to moments of 35mm beauty was just spectacualr, and the narrative the film tells was very intriguing. Most people that I have talk to that have seen this were put down by the red watermark in the upper right hand corner of the film, but I found that it added a whole new level to the film. The watermark appears when the word ""Epidemic"" is being typed on the cover page of a script that Lars and Neils are working on, and stays mostly visible throughout the film to signify that what you are viewing is the screenplay (or is it? :D) It works for me. The plot takes enough meaningful sharp lefts that it stayed very interesting and kept me asking ""Where is this going?"" but in a good way.
And that ending...just so freaking awesome. To me, it makes the film worth watching (setting aside the relatively slow pacing at times).

The only thing I have against the film is the song that plays for the end credits...it is so terrible. I mean, if Trier's purpose for the song was to bring the audience out of the experience that the film throws you into, then he achieved his goal. Right after that amazing finale, I was letting the movie sink in, and wating for the credits, and this horrible pop theme song for the film begins playing. I almost shed tears of disappointment.
