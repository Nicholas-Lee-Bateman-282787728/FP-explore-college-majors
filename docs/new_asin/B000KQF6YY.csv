8158718,2,B000KQF6YY,This definitely isn't like other yoga DVDs I've tried. But the first sequence of a few moves at the beginning she just did over and over so much that by the time she moved on to something else I was already bored with it and just shut it off.,1403049600,,242,3.9591836734693877

8158720,4,B000KQF6YY,"Shelly McDonald has a quiet voice, which is relaxing. She is clear on her instructions of how to hold your body and gives the easier to more challenging choices in each move. That makes the routine helpful for a range of people. If you are a beginner, she moves quickly, so you must listen to her caution: do what you can do and do not do anything your body is uncomfortable with. The DVD called Stretch Into Yoga is slower paced and could be tried first, then advance to this routine. Once you have tried this DVD and can complete all 3 routines at once, it is a great feeling of accomplishment! Your body will thank you for it!",1283644800,4,629,4.294117647058823
8158721,4,B000KQF6YY,I love Shelly McDonald so I decided to order this workout. It is really easy to follow and also very effective but the cuts for commercials are really disturbing.,1209945600,,162,4.620689655172414
