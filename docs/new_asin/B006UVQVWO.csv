8504835,5,B006UVQVWO,"Although I didn't purchase my video from Amazon, I bought it at a quilt show I just had to post a review. I am new to applique and had been struggling. Not anymore. Nancy not only demonstrates the stitches she explains why you do them the way she shows them and even why you hold your needle a certain way. The videography is superb, giving a clear view of the stitches as Nancy performs them. In addition there's a pattern included of the project Nancy demonstrates in the video so you can sew along with her and stop and rewind whenever you need to  Can't praise this video highly enough. I did purchase John James Gold'nGlide Milliner needles in the size recommended in the video from Amazon and have posted a review on Amazon.",1412553600,2,730,4.447761194029851
