639628,5,6303422004,"We all heard the rumor that still circulates today about pop singer Michael Jackson bleaching his skin. And that rumor was proven untrue. Here in this film we see C. Thomas Howell's caucasian character consuming an abundance of dark-tanning pills so he could look like a negro. His intention was to spend quality time with his black girlfriend(Rae Dawn Chong) who attends an all-black college. ""This is the eighties,man. It's the Cosby decade!"",Howell's character tells one of his buddies. Yes,it was 1986 and Bill Cosby's hit NBC sitcom The Cosby Show was #1 in the Nielsen ratings. Leslie Nielsen has a bit role in the film playing Howell's father. Great film!",1112659200,2,662,4.972972972972973
639629,5,6303422004,"This is definetely 1 of C.Thomas Howell's greatest films ever! Not that all of his movies aren't completely awesome! He has been my favorite actor since I saw him in E.T. I've been collecting all his pictures,articles,and movies since then. Well this story talks about a young man lol* named Mark Watson (C.Thomas Howell) and he is from Los Angeles CA. He and his friend Gordo both get scholarships to Harvard Law School. Besides the fact that they are very excited,Mark needs to do 1 thing. He needs the money. His father tells him that he is giving him his manhood. Then he breaks the bad news and tells Mark that he needs to find the money himself. When Mark and Gordo look through a pamphlet about Harvard, Mark finds that there might just be a way to get the money. So then Mark gets some tanning lotion from his friend, and pretends to be black. He thinks that it will help him,and it does. When Mark and Gordo arrive at Harvard Mark meets another black student who he then falls in love with (Rae Dawn Chong) Mark goes through many things while pretending to be black. He hears racist slurs everyday every minute. A really funny part is where the professor (James Earl Jones) is taking attendance and he calls Mark's name and Mark replies with ""Right On"" instead of ""here"" And when Mark is hiding his identity from his parents and he takes off the mask and says ""Mom,Dad, I'm Black! The movie is really great,and the best of the 1980's. So go out and rent it",1007856000,4,1465,4.449814126394052

This is an absolutely hysterical movie. Howell is really funny pretending to be black. I almost lost it when James Earl Jones was taking attendance and Howell responded to his name being called by saying ""Right On.""
This is also a great social commentary. It illustrates how black people get handouts left and right by universities. Hopefully our country's law-makers will see this movie and end affirmative action.",1004832000,2,465,4.89873417721519

639633,4,6303422004,"Considering the depth in which C Thomas has sunk himself at the end of the 80's, this is his best movie since The Outsiders. It is to be taken as entertainment rather than a ""life lesson on tolerance"" and I  loved it. It is among my fav' 80's movies along the side of The Breakfast  Club, Sixteen Candles or the Karate Kid.",950140800,,323,4.193548387096774
639634,5,6303422004,"I think the goal here is to focus on the love story.  Rae Dawn Chong and C. Thomas Howell really do have a lot of chemistry if you just pay attention.  Watch their eye contact and those nice little smiles!  Of  course the actual idea of  someone pretending to be black is a little over  the top...but at least he seemed to learn something valuable towards the  end.  They are cute together in the movie.  Unfortunately, there are some  who can't appreciate the fact that underneath it all, physically we all  pretty much contain the same organs.  African American people are rich in  culture and heritage and hopefully one day, we can see the movie for what  it is, a comedy.  Look at the love, that's what really made me keep  watching.  They were just really cute and I guess I am kind of a romantic,  so I would have liked to see more of them together!
Give it a chance -  you just might surprise yourself and laugh a little, enjoy it!  Incidentally, James Earl Jones is wonderful as the Professor!",934848000,,1001,4.395604395604396

639675,5,6303422004,Classic movie,1463788800,,13,6.0
639676,4,6303422004,"Im sure that nowadays, this movie would be considered blatantly racist because the main character darkens his skin (ie blackface).  But Robert Downey Jr did that in Tropic Thunder and was largely supported for his satire, and in my opinion, this movie does that particular brand of racial satire even better than Tropic Thunder did.

Naturally, the blackface in Soul Man is used to make fun of white peoples behavior, rather than blacks.  In spite of an overall lowbrow comedic tone, this movie impressively makes nearly every social justice point about race that I thought had been invented in the 2000-teens.  Listing all the ones that come to mind:

Liking black celebrities or media does not make you not racist.  (This is the age of Bill Cosby!  America loves black people!)

Racist jokes are not okay or non-hurtful because you're just kidding.

Entitlement has real consequences.

Just because a white person doesnt see racism doesnt mean its not there.

Even positive stereotypes (black men are great at sports/naturally musical/bigger in bed) are offensive.

You cant actually understand the corrosive effect of racism unless you have to live with it your whole life.

Affirmative action and race-based scholarships don't begin to mean that the playing field is level for white people and PoC in education.

These are things that were still struggling to hammer into many peoples heads, and the movie makes a persuasive case for all of them fairly elegantly.  Yes, C. Thomas Howell wore black person makeup, but that was only to illustrate how completely detached white people are from the realities of PoC.  And the tone was comedic because, well, having a serious conversation about race is appetizing to very few (white) people.  It needs to be done, but its a lot easier if youve sneakily opened peoples minds while letting them learn through laughter.",1463184000,,1865,5.022801302931596

639756,5,6303422004,"I think the first 10 or 15 minutes are a little slow and boring.  But once it gets to the point where he becomes a ""black man"" it starts to get really interesting.  Yes the movie took a risk that was maybe before it's time and it didn't do well because some people thought it was ""racist"" -- but as a minority woman I did not think it was racist at all.

In fact I thought it was actually quite careful not to be racist.  One of the things I hate about America is how politically correct we are, how careful everyone is to walk on eggshells.  If everyone is that careful our world will become more and more plastic and boring.  We need more movies that take a risk!

For example, Robert Downey Jr played a black man in Tropical Thunder and the Wayans brothers played white girls in White Chicks and neither of those movies were considered racist by the majority.  But this one was.",1434412800,4,881,4.233532934131737

It's okay for 2 Wayans brothers to go ""white face"" and poke fun at and caricaturize ditsy white girls, but this movie, clearly made LONG before ""Wayans"" was ever a household name, gets crusified? Give me a break. I'm sure those of you bashing this one probably watched ""White Chicks"" and laughed your a$$es off.

It's a friggin movie. Get over it. I hate it when people try to go all politically correct and make a statement about racism hoping not to sound racist themselves. Your ""reviews"" aren't deep and thought provoking, they're just plain stupid.",1426291200,,662,4.8584070796460175

639821,3,6303422004,"This movie is offensive to blacks, whites, women, and men, pretty much equally because of the puny moral and intellectual universe the characters inhabit. We rented this because our son is starting *HARVARD* *LAW* *SCHOOL* this fall and the most redeeming part of the movie for us was the way everyone in the movie said those words like that, in all-caps with asterisks, i.e. in a tone of absolute awe. Rae Dawn Chong is the only one who is not hamming it up. The characters are all stereotypes, and the writing is lowest common denominator. James Earl Jones as a prof. at Harvard Law is impressed by the doofus things our main character says, when he should say, ""Nice try, but anyone admitted to *H*L*S* could blow that stuff out of any orifice."" This movie makes you appreciate the greatness of The Paper Chase. Heck, it made me appreciate Legally Blonde!

Let me be clear, I don't think the premise is racist or offensive, and a great movie could have been made here. There are some rich mistaken identity/costume  bits here that in the right hands (Plautus or Shakespeare) could get a lot of laughs. But the writers really coast on stereotypes and do not rise to anything beyond.",1403136000,,1184,4.660287081339713
639822,1,6303422004,"The late Roger Ebert's review of this film beautifully skewers the flimsiness of the premise and the absurdity of the limp climax. However, Mr. Ebert perhaps didn't go far enough: this film deserves outright condemnation. This is *not* the heartwarming story of a privileged white boy learning how it feels to be not-white in 1980's America. Rather, this is the meta-story of a film director, screen writer, and a genuinely talented cast setting out to make a heartwarming story and instead demonstrating how incredibly and inexcusably out of touch they are with their own topic.

I didn't think it was possible to dislike such a likeable character as Mark Watson, portrayed by the also-likeable C. Thomas Howell. The first time Mark and his equally silver-spooned bro-friend discuss Mark's transformation into a man of color, both Mark Watson and C. Thomas Howell suddenly become repulsive. It's like watching those old black-and-white cartoons that portray black men as incompetent buffoons, but inverted so that the black buffoon is actually a white preppie with a deep tan. Some of this banter is both breathtakingly racist and completely void of irony.

Even James Earl Jones - himself a veteran of Blaxploitation flicks - seems completely unaware of how deeply he caricatures himself by association with this film. To make another analogy to early-20th century racist cartoons, the lives of the black characters revolve around one or more white characters. Before there was M.C. Hammer, there was Mr. Vader, proudly displaying his ""Biggest Black Sellout in Hollywood"" wreath.

It's as if everybody involved with filming this garbage completely swallowed the propaganda of their own idiotic tagline: ""He didn't give up, he got down"". We should be so lucky.",1402185600,,1761,5.215547703180212

Thomas Howwel removes his afro, and wipes off his makeup, to reveal that he's transformed into an attractive white woman.  Some relationship stuff happens. Will they or won't they? but in the end love is all that matters, Well, Love and blackface.

It is the story of an over-privileged kid accepted to Harvard law who cannot afford to go (because his father is teaching him a lesson) and decides to cheat...a little.  While he is getting his lesson he learns first hand about bigotry and unintended consequences as he comes face to face with people he inadvertantly hurts in his struggle to become a US Senator or another ""socially significant"" contributor to society.
The humor is mostly juvenile but it has a decent story and I highly recommend it.

The 80s were just fun in general.  Comedies centering around racial issues have been around a long time, but they did it with enough dignity and enough story line to get away with it.

Of course, the climate was different back then.

While the make-up job wasn't as good as Robert Downey's in Tropic Thunder, the story line certainly holds a little bit more water.  And it is a good story.

639985,2,6303422004,"""Soul Man"" was a well meaning but extremely lame comedy about a White So Cal student who scams his way into Harvard School of Law on a scholarship for Black students. Now that we have a Black President of the United States--or will very soon--who actually attended Harvard School of Law, this movie seems to be very outdated. It wasn't well received when it was released in 1986 either, and it is easy to see why. It just isn't very funny, and the writing and situations that could have arisen from such a mix up are never exploited for any real comic value. For instance, the scene where his parents come to visit, not knowing that he has taken a pill to turn his skin black, and meanwhile the landlord's daughter waits for him in the bedroom is just rather awkward and unbelievable.

------------
Mark Watson: Mom! Dad! There's something I have to tell you... I'm black.
=====================================

Likewise, the White students who crack Black jokes don't ring true; they are cardboard one dimensional characters. The incidents are just shoe horned in. The reactions Mark gets when people think he's Black, such as expecting him to be a good basketball player, are very tired clichs. Finally, he just doesn't even look Black, just more like he has a perm and a tan.

While ""Soul Man"" was a fiasco as a comedy, the romance between Sarah Walker (Rae Dawn Chong) and Mark Watson (C. Thomas Howell) was pleasantly amusing--and guess what? A few years later the two got married for real, though it only lasted about a year. James Earl Jones was impressive as Professor Banks, a teacher who didn't cut Mark any slack just because he was Black, and instead pushed him even harder.

---------------------
Professor Banks: Mr. Watson, I am not a humorous man, but if you insist on taking up my class time making jokes, please see to it that they are funny.

Also has a very cool 80's soundtrack but most importantly, a surpising life lesson attached. I won't elaborate too much, but Soulman is worth adding to your collection of movies.

Certainly, it is an ability to see personal serious problems from different points of views, while laughing at them and being at the end of a day proud Americans regardless race, faith and other sometimes troubling sex-life differences.

Mark, a lustful sexy youngster from a rich upper class Californian family, established in Harvard as an Afro-American grant recipient acquires new knowledge of a native country and practically demonstrates developments in steadily challenging interracial problems faced since a very foundation of the Land of Free.

Surprisingly, this very much segregation-motivated work has became one of my favourite movies for an intelligently depicting optimism of positive outcomes time brings about.

And actors are IT.",1193097600,,786,5.635593220338983
639988,2,6303422004,"I was only eleven or twelve when this movie came out.  C Thomas Howell was a bit of a teen idol back then, and I didn't get a lot of the themes and things the movie was about.  Seeing it as an adult, I tried to separate myself from the things that this movie was accused of.  It's quite hard, being that I lived through the politically correct 90s and now well into the humility of the 2000s as we face the economic crisis.  This movie falls short in many ways.

C Thomas Howell, who ended up committing career suicide with this project and now finds himself in the strait to video bin, has lost the financial backing of his father and is not going to an Ivy League college as he thought he was.  Then he comes across some pills that will chemically tan your body, pops many MANY pills, and becomes so brown that he looks black.  He then goes to said Ivy League school on a black scholarship program.

Is it funny?  Parts are, but they are physical comedy things.  And they make a few racist comments.  You would have to be deaf, dumb and blind to not notice them.  The premise of the movie was so crazy you almost couldn't believe it, but for some reason it happened.  Why?  I'm still not sure.  A movie like this wouldn't get off the ground today, let alone be put on paper.  Are we better people because of this?  Maybe, as we can recognize racist comments and humor now.  It wasn't offensive, it was just a poorly written movie.",1181779200,,1432,4.2407407407407405
639989,4,6303422004,"I like this movie. I tell you why. As first you think, wow that is so uncool and very mean spirited way to get a scholar. But at the end of the movie, you see that there was a ""moral and a reflection of the cultures."" Even though this movie wasn't a true story, we get to see the both sides of the spectrum. I thought this movie has some great parts. Like picking Thomas to be in the basketball team because they thought he was good. The Roll Call of ""Right On!"" Classic! When he went to the Kitchen without the Mask, ""Look'n good momma, look'n good!"" And it was his mother?!?!?! ""I'm taking Law..."" Friend said, ""I thought you were taken?"" ""That was before I knew the professor was a Brutha!"" I thought for James Earl Jones to take his role, I thought it was a cool thing for him to do.  Would of thought he would be uptight for this.  I would of thought for sure he would of thought the script is overboard and racist. Another classic part, when he (James) said, ""Next time here's my phone number, if you go to jail again call me, I will bring your books!!"" Come on, classic. It had a love story feel to it, that sometimes like Thomas said, ""I never expected to fall in love with her."" I got so use to seeing Thomas with the color pill change treatment that when at the end, I was like ""Oh, that is what he looks like."" But one think that was an eye opener was those two white kids with those racist jokes (realist though that there's some that do that) in the end got Karma!!! Reminds me of ""White Chicks"" from the Wayans, that was a good movie, and we see how white chicks act and ""yes"" like this movie, there's exaggeration, but all for the laughs of how we see things. I like this movie. A very classic comedy!",1177113600,3,1716,4.15015015015015
639990,4,6303422004,"As we continue to be stifled by the almost unbearable, oppressive air of political correctness by the people who constantly complain about oppression, there is no doubt in my mind that Soul Man could not be made today.

For centuries, people have been using comedy as a way to explore issues that would be seen as didactic if addressed with a straight face. Literature giants like Voltaire used comedy to address social issues, with his story Candide being one of the funniest things I've ever read. Soul Man addresses racial issues in America; but because it's done with humor instead of drama, people see it as ""making fun of"" minorities rather than ""helping"" minorities.

Soul Man is a humorous film trying to help those who obviously have no sense of humor. A spoiled, rich white kid takes a lot of tanning pills, gets a jheri curl, and steals a scholarship meant for a black Harvard applicant because his father decided to stop supporting him. He finds out later he stole the scholarship from a woman (Rae Dawn Chong) who deserved it ten times more than he. C Thomas Howell grows and becomes more sensitive to black issues and blacks in general as he spends this brief period as a black man and falls in love with a black woman. He gains character and wisdom. And as he told his professor, played by James Earl Jones, he will never know what it's like to be black, because no matter how bad it got, he could always get out.

It doesn't make fun of blacks. It makes fun of whites who have their own closed-minded impressions. The stereotypical scenes in the movie come from the ignorance of the white characters, not the ignorance of the moviemakers.

Even though C. Thomas Howell's career unfairly suffered because of this BOLD movie, he did meet and end up marrying Rae Dawn Chong.",1155859200,32,1787,4.62776025236593
639991,5,6303422004,"This is a pure classic.  Comedy gold.  Everyone is at the top of their game in it, James Earl Jones C. Thomas Howell, Rae Dawn Chong, Arye Gross, a pre-Seinfeld Julia Louis-Dreyfus.  The commentary by Steve Miner and C. Thomas Howell is cool and informative.  They are bewildered at all the controversy this film caused, and so am I.  Because in the 80's, I never heard any controversy about this film, because I was a kid, enjoying it.  Anyone that says this film is racist is ignorant, or has no sense of humor.  I wager both.  This film pokes fun at stereotypes.  Have fun with it.  The more you make it taboo, the greater the backlash will be.  Like I said, this is a classic.  The 80's was the best decade ever.",1148774400,13,716,4.340909090909091
639992,3,6303422004,"As of this writing I am watching this on HD.  Back in the day when this came on cable, I thought that it was foolish because the guy looked more like an Indian(black toom but Asian) than a regular African-American.  Seeing it on HD, you see that the make up looks even worse.

This is you typical film in Hollywood designed to not only make fun of black by pretending to teach whites how they feel subconciously about blacks, but it is also an overtly racist film by trying show that a white man was shut out of an education by a mandatory black quota.  They don't fool me.  This is typical racism in film in the 1980's.  Only After Spike Lee made it big did things begin to change.  No more ""N"" words(without a black in the film), no more black or ""soul brother"" jokes, no more black women wh want to sex white guys(they never show the black guys sexing black women of course...) and no more idiot films such as these.  This film has ALL of the black stereotypes in the book, not excluding the black basketball specialist.  You know, kind of what you see in commercials today!  A black man in sports.  While the forcefullness these types of films has changed, the images are still here today, just disguised to make black people think that they are looking cool and being recognized.  Blacks in Hollywood are only being recognized for sports, music, dance and all out foolishness.

Looking at it today, it seems totally foolish.  It is worth watching just to see it, but as with most films, this is designed to brainwash the audience.  Not for the postive of blacks, but for the subliminal ""reverse racism"" story.  Every film has a messege and this film's messege is that black mave experience racism, but they get over and hurt white people in the end.",1137801600,4,1754,4.468553459119497
