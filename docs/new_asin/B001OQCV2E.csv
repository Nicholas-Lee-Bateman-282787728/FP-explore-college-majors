3731641,2,B001OQCV2E,"This movie has outstanding, large-scale eye candy and an interesting apocalypse scenario. It tries to salvage itself from pure spectacle by injecting gooey interpersonal dynamics and unremarkable class/power/politics commentary.

Low expectations will serve you well. See it in on the biggest screen you can find. This one will not make the transition to DVD very well unless you have a Bill Gates sized movie theater in your basement.",1258156800,11,435,5.397058823529412

3731644,5,B001OQCV2E,"Is what I say to describe this film. It is the type of film to be seen in a theatre then enjoyed for years later at home.  The special effects are absolutely breathtaking and awesome. I loved The Day After Tomorrow and 2010 takes it to the next level. It is about the complete destruction of the world. Unlike the '70's disaster films, which I still love, that featured all star casts; pre CGI special effects- (some laughable by today standards but very good for it's day), some even Academy Award winning for it's special effects (Earthquake). Todays disaster films feature known stars but focus on a few main characters and then many, many extras....To see all the places we know be destroyed and then later on to be washed away by tsunamis will leave your heart pounding. The arks that are used to save folks and take them away in the waters are soooo cool.

The characters, actors of course take a back sit to the effects but are still hold there own. John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Thandie Newton, Woody Harrelson, George Segal and Oliver Platt are all good.  So is Chiwetel Ejiofor, who I had never heard of before. Danny Glover, who never seems to  age, is the President (the second disaster film to have a black president, the first was Deep Impact with Morgan Freeman)

But when it's all said and done it comes back again to the special effects. I take my hat off to director Roland Emmerich for another great disaster film. He adds that to his credits along with the disaster/end of the word hits Independence Day and one of my fave movies The Day After Tomorrow. I can not believe he is the same director that gave us the turkey, the  awful Godzilla remake(Jurassic Park creatures) but hey, everyone is entitled to one mistake. And wtih Tomorrow and 2012 coming after that he has redeemed himself.",1258156800,3,1804,4.569659442724459
3731645,1,B001OQCV2E,"I was among those with great expectations about this movie, curious about the approach chosen regarding to the 2012 Mayan prediction, and looking forward for the spectacular special effects (SFX) shown in the trailer. However, the movie falls shorts in both aspects, and particularly its relationship with the 2012 is practically just an excuse to produce an catastrophic end of the world movie, as the Mayan prediction is just casually mentioned a couple of times (for the different interpretations of this phenomena see the documentary&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2012-Science-Or-Superstition/dp/B001IF5PCE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2012: Science Or Superstition</a>).

Regarding the SFX do not get misled by the trailers, great scenes are limited to two, the California earthquake and the Yellowstone super-volcano, and both are full of exaggerations just aimed to spice the action. The destruction of Rio de Janeiro, the Vatican, and the tsunamis are just very brief scenes, so, even SFX fans will be disappointed as there is a lot of not so interesting and often boring dialogues between the SFX catastrophic scenes. Finally, even though it is normal to expect quite a dose of exaggerations in a movie like this, these guys overdid it, e.g. both airplane stunts are really childish, and cellular phones still working when the world is falling apart?

And as for content and message, the movie is very poor in these departments too. Not only the acting is cardboard, but the storyline is incredible close to the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/War-of-the-Worlds-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JNTI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">War of the Worlds (Widescreen Edition)</a>, divorced father, the kid gets alone better with his step-father, .... Furthermore, the modern Noah's Ark closing segment completely misses the climax of the storyline, and also misses to opportunity to deliver a real message. Sincerely, at this point I was just wishing for the movie to end. What a disappointment!!!

And just in case you are wondering that I was too harsh, by early 2011 NASA has rated ""2012"" as the ""Most Unrealistic Sci-Fi of All Time"" as this flick leads NASA's list of the seven least plausible science fiction movies ever made. NASA commented that 2012 was considered the most absurd sci-fi flick of all time.",1258156800,,2393,5.792613636363637
3731646,5,B001OQCV2E,"I think people judge these movies very unfairly. It surprises me when a movie like 2012 comes along and it's ripped apart before it's even released. ""This movie's gonna blow, it's two and a half hours of things blowing up."" I have to play back the sentence in my mind and figure out what was negative about that concept. These movies are meant to be fun, and usually nothing more than that.

I say ""usually"" because sometimes you get a movie that has absolutely no other reason to exist than to make things explode and momentarily lower your IQ (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transformers-Revenge-of-the-Fallen-Single-Disc-Edition/dp/B002IPFWTE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (Single-Disc Edition)</a>&nbsp;is out now. Fun movie.) but occasionally you get something like 2012, which not only offers the calculated mayhem that fans of the action genre desire, but it also offers a surprisingly deep philosophical undertone. Go figure, right?

The movie opens with a fifteen minute montage that sets up the events that will eventually transpire on 2012, and gives us a look at the backroom dealings that occur in the wake of this disturbing discovery concerning the fate of humanity. Once that's over with, the movie picks up rather quickly, introducing us to the main character, Jackson Curtis, his more-than-dysfunctional family and a grab bag of supporting characters. After a botched camping trip, things kick off rather quickly.

What follows are two hours of absolute chaos. The CG in this movie is astounding, and I cannot stress this enough. The action is relentless, creative, and satisfying on the whole. The LA sequence alone will have you smiling, then you will realize you still have a lot more movie to go, and it never disappoints. The pacing is excellent in this regard. I was in awe the entire way through.

That's the bottom line: If you love action movies or a good old fashioned thrill ride, the disaster sequences alone are worth the price of admission (unless you're an astrophysicist, in which case you might be crossing your arms and groaning at this film all the way through).

But what I liked the most about this film was its underlying religious theme. People might be quick to pick up on the major references to this, such as (POSSIBLE SPOILER, though it's in the trailer): the crack forming between Adam and God on Michelangelo's ""Creation of Adam"" at the Sistine Chapel, the destruction of Christ the Redeemer, Vatican City, and the Buddhist temple. With these and other biblical references that you will miss if you blink, Emmerich seems to postulate a world in which you don't need God for miracles, and where everyone is back on even ground again.

Another theme that Emmerich sets up is the social borders that divide us more than we think. In a world that is coming to an end, it's not the strong who survive, only the smartest and the wealthiest. The film argues against utilitarianism on several fronts, going so far as to say that to embrace such a concept to an outrageous extent, even to save mankind, would result in a race of humans deprived of its humanity.

Now, I could be wrong. I'm not saying that my interpretation of the movie is spot on, but the movie did make me think, and that's what I found remarkable returning home from watching a film in which I thought I was just going to watch things blow up for two hours.

I walked in knowing that no one makes disaster movies better than Roland Emmerich, but I ended up watching something that entertained me immensely, made me think, and spurred on a very long conversation between my friends and I. THAT'S how a movie more than earns the price of admission.",1258156800,380,3726,4.959935897435898
3731647,5,B001OQCV2E,"There are those of us whether christian or biblical studiers, and we see events that have happened since we have been able to understand what the Christ and His prophets have forewarned of what would happen to the apocalyptic generation of today. The 21st century started on a bad event(9/11) by the islamic henchmen of Osama Bin Laden(the anti-christ, when Iran gets its nuclear bomb(s) and events that have happened on a natural scene(deadly earthquakes, cataclysmic tsunami of 2004, deadly hurricanes and typhoons, and worldwide wild fires). But the middle-eastern wars in Iraq and Afghanistan(no one is trying to walk away) is going to lead to the unthinkable, because time is being made for the right government to get the weapon other governments don't want that government to have. Rest assured when that small nation gets it, it will use it like suicide bombers use theirs without caring about the personal consequences. 2012, from what I've seen on Youtube gives a look into the 7(seven) last plagues of Revelation chapter 16. We have been warned for almost 2000 years since the Christ left to set up the spiritual world up for His christians. 2033 is coming, and 2012 is the beginning of the 21 year countdown to end of the natural creation. This country and its serious immorality is the reason for its downfall; America, the Rome, Sodom/Gomorrha or Babylon of the modern age!

3731772,1,B001OQCV2E,"The most clich&eacute;d film I ever had the misery to watch. The trailer is nothing like the movie. But if you have seen one Emmerich movie, you have seen them all. SPOILER ALERT. From the ""Aw-Shucks"" performance of John Cusack, to the lovable but crazy conspiracy redneck played to hilarious effect by, are you ready for it, Woody Harrelson, to the miscasting of Danny Glover as President, to the video-conference of world leaders dealing somberly and ineptly with the news of the end of the world, to the ridiculous car chase through a collapsing Los Angeles, to the fact that cell phones continue to work as the underlying infrastructure of civilization is swept away, to the familiar CGI images of collapsing cities, to refueling a jet with gasoline, to the preposterous thesis of rogue neutrinos caused by an alignment of planets melting the earth's crust, this movie is the least exciting, most boring in Roland Emmerich's tired career. Even the person who chose the film for us agreed that we should skip more than an hour of the film and just watch the last 5 minutes to see what happens. Unfortunately, all the plutocrats and government leaders who purchased tickets, are saved. Of course, this was way too accurate for Hollywood, and so a few paupers were saved as well. In fact, that was the only redeeming part of the film, the fact that when the end of the world comes, only the uber-rich will stand a chance of survival. In hindsight, the paupers would be necessary, otherwise who would do the work in the coming years?",1496620800,,1533,4.745318352059925

The ending read outloud was corny. But at the same time..I watch this movie over and over..I will draw and paint to this movie as the back ground..and look at the larger than life effects. What hurts movies like this is..the actors role is just to get you to the next effect..so they don't care allot making lines stronger..your rushed around so much..you can't connect to one person. when people die..your not sure if your sadden by it..But at the same time..It is entertaining..it does it job. John Cusack doesn't act in many movies like this..what makes him John Cusack isn't used to the full effect..it would be like putting Nic Cage as a mute monk in this movie..they could have switched roles. John Cusack with Zlatko Buric..that would amp it up some,1490745600,,918,4.569696969696969

My name is Isiah and I'm from Tallahassee, Florida and I am telling you that we need to ADD a certain movie to our hall a classics; classics where even today, they give us pause with their messages, themes, story lines, and sometimes, special effects. One of these movies, based on my humble opinion, should be the Roland Emmerich's film-the Mother of Disaster Films, the film that ended the 2000s with a bang...""2012""!! Roland Emmerich was born in 1955 in Germany and is well known massive disaster movies such as ""Independence Day"" (1996), ""Godzilla"" (1998), ""The Day After Tomorrow"", and recently ""White House Down"". While being criticized for his films being too long, over reliance on special effects, poor character development, and so on, Roland's films, to me, our truly massive and opens up the movie with a global initiative where the disasters he creates affects almost all of the Human species, which is clearly evident in 2012. I first fell in love with Roland's work when his most celebrated work, Independence Day; in which aliens attack the planet during the American holiday of Independence Day. I have seen many documentaries about the making of this movie and the difficult work and skill needed to produce such an epic, from model miniatures to shooting. ID4 has been credited for inaugurating the era of the disaster film that lead up to 2012 and continues to this day. Now, the movie!

I first saw the trailers at my high school during lunch. I remember seeing the images of Los Vegas, the crumbling of the Christ the Redeemer statue and others back in the fall of 2009 when I moved back to Tallahassee from Apalachicola. I was certainly turned on by the sporadic clips of the movie but the LA scene DEFINATLY sealed opinion of the movie. I have never seen destruction of that scale and I would even say it rivals the destruction scene in ID4 where only the US Bank Tower was destroyed. In 2012, the mother of all earthquakes rips apart the West Coast in disaster scenes never before seen. So, on Saturday of November 13, 2009, I invited my dad (despite us not getting along), to see the film at the Tallahassee AMC 20 theater located in the former Tallahassee Mall. I was completely amazed, wowed, and even bought to tears by the movie. the sheer scale, situations, and movie length already suggested to me that this would be an EPIC film. I'm not here to narrate the film since I would assume everyone on this forum has seen the movie in its entirety but I am here to tell you what I got out of the film. The characters are rather well-explained and have taken their roles respectively. President Thomas Wilson (Danny Glover) is rather an ode to the accomplishment of Barack Obama who has been informed of the 2012 situation and his visibly concerned but not overly dramatic about it (since, the information of the end is being kept away from the public). The fact that, during the catastrophes, the President remained to address the nation one last time rather than board the arks in China speaks to his attribute of Humanity. Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) is a struggling father and holding odd jobs who is estranged from his ex-wife and kids but still manages to care and hold on to hope that he will one day be reunited with his family- a massive global event just so happen to set those wheels in motion. Adrian Helmsley (played by Chiwetel Ejiofor) takes is job vary seriously and in a way has been the voice of the Humanity through science, him being the one who knows the the disasters are about to happen much sooner than expected and collaborates with world leaders to save Humanity. Finally, Oliver Platt plays Chief of Staff Carl Anheuser, a rather snobbish individual who is only concern with control and power rather than love and compassion-in contrast to the humanitarian of Helmsley. I was wowed by the grand scale of the calamities at hand; massive earthquakes literally ripping apart continents, terrible volcanic eruptions, to massive tsunamis flooding every country, this movie is as close to slow-pace end-of-the-world as you can get (as opposed to ""Knowing"" which ends it all in one swift blow). The movie, thankfully,takes place in 2012 and the human race is going about their normal lives, unaware that most of them will be dead in a few days, note the playful chatter of the morning radio hosts in LA after an earthquake when we are first introduced to Jackson Curtis's character. This movie could have easily been set during or after the cataclysms and then the background development would have been absent, which would have made this movie less enjoyable. Due to the hysteria that would have enveloped the populace if knowledge of the disaster was made public, the governments of the world hold on to information to ensue a selected few survive. The disaster happens and its a struggle between the ones chosen to survive and everything else. Those in the disaster  zone are obviously dead, those not there are scrambling to survive but know that their time is coming as whole civilizations are virtually wiped out. Those chosen to survive are now in charge of likely saving the human race from extinction despite  being selected because of their checkbooks. Finally, the movie details the most single destructive event in modern earth history and
certainly human history,not even a large-scale nuclear war could compete with this, in my opinion. In many cases, the governments of the world
 have abandoned their people and let then fend for themselves, it shows whole cultures and societies being systematically destroyed; the fact that America, the sole superpower of the earth, ceases to exist after being ravaged by earthquakes, tsunamis, and the Yellowstone eruption and subsequent ash cloud. Indeed, the world has sure come to and end. One could only imagine families,couples, and even total strangers either fighting each other ore holding hands as they wait to die. Hell, i almost cried when President Wilson died when the U.S.S. John F. Kennedy hit the White House and along with billions of others. In addition, human greed and the dark side of Capitalism ultimately ensured that only a select few survived due to their financial situation, as opposed rather how they could contribute to a post-2012 world or not. I actually thought that the 2012 myth would happen in some form when during the 2011 Japanese earthquake and tsunami and the destructive 2011 tornado outbreak in the Midwestern United States. But, in 2012, had my first prom, I graduated from high school, and started college. The only thing that happened on December 21, 2012 was the movie ""2012"" in honor of the date, premiered on the FX Channel. Humanity breathed a sigh of relief. (Lol!) This movie is certainly ca classic and it should be treated as such.
So what do you think?

According the Mayan calendar, the world ""will"" end in 2012 (writing this in 2016 tells us different).  Personally, I think it was more the Gary Larson thought - they just ran out of room on that rock to continue the calendar.

The special effects aren't that great.  There are many times the green screen imaging definitely shows ""the line"".  Those effects weren't as seamless as some movies.  Surprisingly, too, considering the amount of money spent for this film (estimated at $200M USD).  Regardless, Cusack's character, Jackson Curtis is ""fun"" and caring.  He wants to get his family to safety and works his heinie off to do so.

3732289,1,B001OQCV2E,"Emmerich is no Bruckheimer. Bruckheimer realises that you have to at least some semblance of acting talent on the screen to bestow even a fig leaf of respectability to what is basically second rate material. Will Smith is Bruckheimer's Charlton Heston, poor as that may be, Emmerich plumps for John Cusack which is a disaster in itself...As an ex teacher I can spot a plodder (or two) from a mile away.

He is no Irwin Allen either in whom first class movie making skills are never abandoned and often acting and scripts conveying the essence of human dignity and the will to survive against beastly inhuman odds create Hollywood masterpieces out of fairly trivial story lines. Emmerich simply isn't in that class of director.

While the Day After was basically watchable (I think I was asleep some of the time especially during the snow vehicle scenes before warming up for the burning of the books...an act of cultural destruction, with all its dark ramifications, seemingly glorified here which left me open mouthed with pop corn hitting the floor) with the odd clumsy moment and unintentional hilarity, this revisiting of more or less the same story line left me gasping for realised space. In effect SOMEWHERE, where anything MAKES SENSE.

Right from the start the impression sets in you are watching scenes from other movies (much better movies) and at one point I fantasised I was balancing on top of a pile of a thousand ex rental DVDs and VHS boxes swaying and vibrating as the earth's crust disintegrated under the sheer tedium of their contents. There were no believable people to help me. Like in the film...

It's all here, every single dirt wipe of a Hollywood, bigging up the American Way, with clich upon clich: the big machines and technology courtesy of the military establishment that will save the deserving; the cuddly feely family moments; the supermarket/shopping mall disaster with plenty of product placement; I shall never forget those Bran Flakes wobbling on the shelf; ""Remember, I told you about that dam in China?"" - yeah they can't build anything right; the anti-hero (eh, Cusack) who is enough of a failure to become identifiable by every red blooded male who has been conned into watching this film and stumbles out at the end feeling cheated and unsatisfied; the birds...the birds...the birds in flight; the spaced out hippie leftover who is a visionary on skunk, ""I wish you could see what I am seeing folks"" as we get to peek at his builder's crack in the foreground with a Mt Helena eruption transposed to the Californian countryside in the background. A whole state descends into a molten inferno but the family escapes in their small hobby plane. Token appearances from suitably ethnic actors around the world confirm the Earth is doomed. And everything has to be big...gigantic...not one tsunami but choreographed so each continent has a fair share in the mayhem. Everything gets turned over (but surprisingly we do not see the fall of the Temple in Jerusalem) including the somewhat offensive scene where praying Christians are flattened by the collapse of St Peter's in Rome. There's even time for a passing nod at the Poseidon Adventure. Oh Roland...you naughty boy, dream on, dream on You'll never be as good as that...and you know it!

""We're heading straight into the north face of Mt Everest"" and my brains felt like it already had.

Do you know...I am sick of this type of film and its negative underpinnings. It is basically nauseating for its insulting estimation of the average movie goers intelligence. The continual harping on of a dystopian theme, as if to justify the current inequalities in wealth and income across the globe that we have today, anchored by neo-liberal politics and capitalist monopoly economics, the I'm-all-right-Jack mentality glossed over in a We-are-all-in-it-together fantasy. ""Attention a potentially hazardous cloud of dust is coming towards Los Angeles"". Was that the same dust in Interstellar another piece of cinematic trash that underwrites current values and while seeming to offer challenge actually aims and succeeds in confirming the status quo. I was uplifted by the low moral tone of this movie; transported by an estranged couple who even while the world was collapsing still had time to discuss their personal lives; enchanted by a mascara runny eyed weeping little girl who bleated ""I don't want to die""; inspired by an Afro-American President who fails the ultimate test of leadership and does a comic Blasted Heath turn on the White House lawn amidst the chaos (did Danny Glover get an offer on this part?) ....are you joking?

""Sir you need to get on Air Force One now!"" And take Emmerich with you! And the innumerable crude Russian portrayals with their phoney fake accents that seem to have muscled in on the rescue plan at some point in the prequels for this film.

""The old man isn't coming"". Well the leader of the free world would rather perish than continue with the humiliation of this film. That's actually in the story line. It is unbelievable. ""Have you completely lost your mind?"" No I am just throwing up.

And reciting Psalm 23 isn't going to help you if you are still in front of the screen after he bails out.

Finally, if you see this in a thrift shop for 10 cents or 50 pence do not do as I did, investigate it. Crush it under your foot.",1457654400,,5352,4.858552631578948

3732309,3,B001OQCV2E,"Okay, what can you really expect from an End of the World disaster type movie?

For what it is, this movie is filled with great special effects of everything falling to pieces and last minute escapes...but none of the characters really mattered or were developed, because the movie was really about everything falling to pieces.  It starts in about 2009 when some scientists figure out that the sun is now shooting off neutrinos that are making the Earth's core heat up and will result in massive and (on a geological scale) pretty impossible sudden shifts in the Earth's crust in 2012.  The result?  Huge earthquakes that break apart the Earth's surface and finally send California into the drink, tidal waves high as mountains, and volcanos galore, including the big one under Yellowstone that could, in reality, wipe out half the US and cause a global ""winter.""  We see some of this in this movie in hair-raising detail, even as our family races from last-minute escape from most of them.  Completely unbelievable, but there you have it.

A fun movie if you like that sort of thing and can shut off thinking too much for over 2 hours.

Funniest thing about the movie was where the South Pole gets shifted to...I won't spoil that, though.",1456704000,,1240,4.761682242990654

I watched it right after the newer San Andreas Movie, which is another AWESOME movie I might add, to compare the two movies because my husband insisted that they were exactly the same, and no they are not, they are similar as they are both natural destruction movies and both have similar characters, such as the two fathers trying to save their child/children and the ex wife and her new beau, but they are about two different things and have two different stories. Even several years after it's been out, this movie still stands up to others and even though the special effects are quite as cool as newer films and they aren't as ""clean"", it's still easy to get into and get captured by the story. I give it two thumbs up, a 10/10, and 5 stars! It's one of those movies that no matter who you are, you gotta atleast see it!",1454889600,4,933,4.337142857142857

3732597,3,B001OQCV2E,"2012 is a science fiction film wherein disaster movie maven Emmerich crafts this apocalyptic sci-fi thriller following the prophecy stated by the ancient Mayan calendar, which says that the world will come to an end on December 21, 2012.

When a global cataclysm thrusts the world into chaos, divorced writer and father Jackson Curtis joins the race to ensure that humankind is not completely wiped out. He attempts to bring his children, Noah and Lilly , ex-wife Kate Curtis and her boyfriend, Gordon Silberman to refuge and attempt to escape the heightened change in the elements.

The movie provides plenty of visual thrills, but lacks a strong enough script to support its massive scope and inflated length.

I've watched a lot of movies like this and you can definitely tell the difference when the disaster scenes are cheaply done. The scenes in this movie are eerily realistic. The story follows several characters in different places and situations, but even the characters not in the main story line are well-developed so you really feel for them and what they're experiencing. This is definitely an action movie, but it's peppered with romance, comedy and suspense, and includes those moments of uneasiness you get in a horror film.",1440806400,10,691,4.914529914529915

3732632,5,B001OQCV2E,"A serious and thought-provoking film, perhaps ahead of its time. Released in 2009 the planet actually is now (2015) experiencing many more climate and events changes that are not to be ignored. And yet, most do. The ""sheep asleep"" fail to notice, looking the other way, not thinking much about it, pre-occupied with all our distractions in life. Major things are taking place all around us, wake up. We really are near ""the end"" and this isn't just Bible-talk. Believe it.  It has been in prophecy for a very long time. The earth will ""cleanse-itself"" as it has in the past. The cast is excellent. Woody Harrelsen on his low-watt radio tower in Yellowstone National Park trying to warn others. Danny Glover as President. The script is excellent too, with thought-provoking quotes...just listen.  And the special effects is state-of-the-art.  This film really has been under-rated and is worth watching, please.

3732733,4,B001OQCV2E,"The Prophets of Doom drew their conclusions by misunderstanding the 'Mayan's last calendar that ran out on December 21st 2012
believing it to indicate 'Worlds-End'
Of course there have always those that warn of 'The End of Days'
The 'Mayan's' had indeed predicted correctly the Galactic alignments years ahead, it has always fascinated me how cultures of the
past such as the 'Mayan's' and ancient 'Egyptians' were able to do this.....
The film of course is a portrayal of how the World as we know it fall apart with tectonic-plate shifts which trigger Earthquakes, Eruptions
and Enormous Tsunami's.
Other than Scientific and Geologist predictions early on we follow the fortunes of many characters, though the films central figures are
'Jackson Curtis' (John Cusack) and his family,children 'Noah' (Liam James) 'Lilly' (Morgan Lily) and former wife 'Kate' (Amanda Peet)
we follow their extremely incredible and unlikely journey to escape the oncoming disaster that was engulfing the Planet and reach the
'Giant - Arcs' that were being prepared for such an event designed to save important figures and in theory preserve humanity.
In truth the actual story-line and script is as many have pointed out, pretty thin, however the thing that does make the film worthy of viewing
is the impressive and awesome Special-Effects throughout the film, not forgetting 'Woody Harrelson's last moments commentating as
Yellowstone's gigantic Volcano blows.
Thoughts - The Prophets of Doom misread the script, I suspect long before our Sun indeed becomes too hot for life to survive, man will
almost certainly have already been the instrument of it's own destruction...........who really knows what the future holds ??

3732825,3,B001OQCV2E,"The writer Christopher Hitchens once said that clich is simply writing what has been written before, and writers should avoid it. Afterall, isn't writing about creating something new? About two or three scenes into ""2012"" I started noticing how much it parallels ""Independence Day"". At the beginning there is a scene in which some scientists are contemplating something astonishing that we can't see and one of them says something to the affect of ""Oh my God"". Next the film quick cuts to Washington DC. In this case, someone says to someone else ""You're about to meet the president."" Then another quick cut to a suburbanite (John Cusak) in mundane suburban America where he is late picking up his kids from his ex-wife. Wasn't there a similar series of sequences in ""Independence Day"" at the beginning? When the film finally get's going and decides on which people it is going to focus, there are two main groups of characters coupled with a lot of little side characters from different corners of the globe. Doesn't this ring of deja-vu all over again? Like Independence Day, there is the US President and his adviser-officials (sound familiar?), a group of suburban American nobodies led by John Cusak, some scientist characters who discover the ""castastrophe"", and a few characters who know these characters. Of course all these groups of people are all interrelated, and the two main groups actually converge. Seems to me this happened in Independence Day, although I think there were three groups of characters instead of two. In both films, the groups come together at a single location.

The basic plot is simple yet global. The entire earth is about to suffer a global catastrophe in which the continental plates of the earth will break loose and start shifting on a massive scale. This will be the end of civilization, including K-Marts, twinkies, McDonalds, Burger Kings, Bank of America and AIG. Not even the Trump Palace will survive. Is this a catastrophe or poetic justice? This is the largest devastation since a comet hit the earth 65 million years ago to end the reign of the Dinosaurs, or at least since the inauguration of the 43rd President of the United States. The governments of the world have known about this for 3 years (since 2009) and have enacted a secret plan to save some of the world's elite, but kept this undercover from the public. Of course the only guy in the world to figure this out is a crazy coot living in the California-Nevada desert, played over-the-top by Woody Harrelson as your quintessential conspiracy theorist. He has even made a little 2-D YouTube video that explains the whole cover-up. As expected, for the movie's sake, he's right. Harrelson was my favorite character of ""2012"".

The real star of ""2012"" has to be the visuals. The destruction of the planet in different parts of the world is probably worth the price of admission, especially to experience on the large screen. The first to fall is, you guessed it, Los Angeles. They always obliterate Los Angeles in these movies. Maybe there's some poetic justice in this. Probably the best sequence is Cusak et al navigating a limo through the streets of Los Angeles, avoiding collapsing offices, government buildings, DMV buildings, IRS buildings, and Hollywood studios. Many other cities around the world have the same fate and it did get a little repetitive after awhile.

When the reality of the disasters is fully explained, I thought the script took a bit of a downturn. Cusak is back with his ex-wife, his kids, and his ex-wife's boyfriend (you have a feeling that either Cusak or the boyfriend will survive but not both) trying to save his family. Some of the acts of heroism reminded me of several other movies I had seen. There's the main presidential adviser, played by Oliver Platt, being just as you expect him, the amoral adviser who willingly sacrifices millions for the sake of a few. There's also the high Russian dignitary whose not only vain but selfish and over-indulges his twin sons. And the scientist that every one takes for granted, played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, was again a bit predictable. I thought one unexpected moment of the film had to do with the US President, played by Danny Glover.

And maybe more unexpected moments is what this movie needed. Aside from the catastrophes and the plot itself which were very unpredictable, the characters never do anything outside the box of how they're defined. The likable characters, like Cusak, are heroic. If they are selfish or amoral, they get their just desserts. Only the US President and Woody Harrelson's character behave unpredictably. American movies of this type are grade A in the visual and effects department, but grade about a C in the character and storyline department. I didn't know where the characters would end up and why, which is good, but I always knew what they would do. And that made it too predictable. I just knew, somewhere in this movie from the get-go, someone was going to make a speech about humanity, using this film as a soapbox. Please not again.",1433030400,,5059,4.865429234338747

The Mayans stopped their calendar as they completed the (then) current 5000 year cycle ( their calendar runs in minor and major cycles) and, really, why write down the next one for people who won't exist for another thousand years or more so they stopped there.
No ""Atta Boy"" for you and good luck  getting Distant ancestors to pay you to do it.
And, really, someone will likely improve the technology and make stone chiseling obsolete in any case.

...... or was the Real reason that the WORLD would END??!!!
And they determined this by watching the stars...... because.... stars know stuff.
Not Hollywood stars of course, those boys and girls are air-heads - I mean the big balls of gas out there.... because they're really big.... and really old and old people know stuff....so....QED!

Yeah, that sounds more plausible.

Political correctness. Science as seen through the eyes of the absurdly math challenged. Mind bending disasters that even a 10 year old would roll their eyes at.... This movie has it All!

The sun is putting out Neutrinos in incredible quantities as it does every 600,000 years or so ( I looked it up on one of those Authoritative blogs- somewhere - these cycles Really exist (InfantBob253 Told me so!...... and InfantBob253 has been ""abducted"" several times - so he knows things).

So as we all know, the scientists are wrong and Neutrinos actually act like microwaves, which can heat up the whole world and cause it to .... contract? Not sure how this works but the sea rises tremendously and that means the world contracted when it heated up. Or maybe it expanded and only some of the water levels rose 10,000 feet while the others went down. China's tectonic plate moves at nearly 100 mph East to West in this movie and actually winds up being a hero of sorts (most tectonic plates wouldn't move that fast to save our heros... good luck getting a tectonic plate to do much of anything most days).
Africa's (rather athletic plate) rises 2 miles in 1 day (better than most mountain climbers)... yet the atmosphere isn't rendered poisonous when so much of the world is exposed to the earth's mantle. Nor is there a nuclear winter for the mind bending amounts of ash that should have been expelled. Boiling oceans, etc - you know the stuff that happens every 600,000 years.

WTF?

This is too ludicrous to show a 6 year old as you would have to constantly be showing little Becky why each scene couldn't actually happen just to keep her from flunking her second grade science class.
Then you'd have to lie to her and say that the progressive education system that spawned the writers of this script didn't exist anymore.... so she'd have to still do her homework if she wanted to see her classmates again in 3rd grade. (You can file that whopper under Santa/Easter bunny if you feel guilty.)

This is the DUMBEST take on a disaster movie that I have ever seen!
The SCARY MOVIE franchise had better technical consultants!
It really needed to be a comedy..... but the writers really, honestly (pathetically?) didn't see the humor value in this.
And That is the real tragedy here.

Skip the first half of this flick, it's shallow stupid PC stereotypical  drivel and deeply stupid.

BUT!

Speaking about the last part of this movie.

IF you really love special effects.

THAT was awesome.

Heck they even DESTROYED Hollyweird! Then they killed Woody Harrelson off!

The effects were amazing and unrelenting,  heart felt, and seamless and well paced.

Imo THIS is what a Hollyweird ""blockbuster"" EFFECTS movie should be.

You can't even buy a good hamburger for what it cost me to atch this movie, (on Amazon instant video).

I'm going to buy a hard copy of this great movie to add to my collection.

Thank you Amazon for making this available at such a affordable price.

Update: I purchased a hardcopy of this for less than $9. on Amazon and it looks way awesome on my HDTV.

3733366,1,B001OQCV2E,"2012 is the latest disaster film by Roland Emmerich.  2012 is essentially every disaster film ever made with all the clichs.  I really felt like weve been here before.  This feels like a rehash of Emmerichs previous disaster film The Day After tomorrow but that film, at least, had some characters I was invested in and moved at a brisker pace (at least it seemed to).  It goes without saying that the very premise this is based on is false because we all know that the 2012 apocalypse is bogus.  Its 2014 and the world is still here.  So, with that knowledge, even the title doesnt make sense so I guess it fits with this film.

The story is very simple.  In 2009 a scientist named Adrian discovers that the Earths core is breaking down and that the world will end in the year 2012.  He informs the government and for the next three years they build arks in secret to prepare for the disaster.  You also have a man named Jackson (John Cusack) whos a failed author coming off of a divorce but is still in contact with his ex-wife and kids.  Eventually the Earth literally begins to crumble under their feet.  Now Jackson, his ex-wife and new husband, and children must outrun the end of the world which they unconvincingly manage to do.

The only thing going for this film is that the disaster scenes looked pretty good.  Roland Emmerich really set out to make the disaster film to end all disaster films.  Admittedly, Ive never quite scene disaster scenes on this scale.  The CGI I think is well-done.  The only thing thats missing is giving a crap.

Nothing else is really good about this.  The characters are nothing.  I wasn't invested in a single one.  The acting isn't that good either even from Cusack.  The score is not that memorable.  The best music is used in the trailer.  Its too long as well.  The pacing felt really slow especially at the end when they're all on the ark, which is maybe do to my lack of investment.  The disaster scenes are cool at first but as it went on they got boring.  This film is basically one giant disaster scene with hardly any breathing room.  The minute they get out of one predicament there is another one waiting for them.  Day After Tomorrow, at least, had some time to breathe and focus on characters and some I actually like.

Plus, there are many things that just make no sense and just took me out.  For example, John Cusack and his family driving through a city that is literally collapsing around them but they are the only ones to escape.  How does that work?  They spot Yellowstone erupting but, somehow, make it out unscathed.  Really?  Yellowstone is a super volcano which is at least a thousand times bigger than a regular one.  If it erupted near you would not live to tell about it.  These scenes wouldnt bother me quite as much if I cared about the characters which, as I said, I did not.

Overall, there are much more enjoyable disaster films out there like Towering Inferno, Twister, Day After Tomorrow, or some giant monster movies like Godzilla just to name a few.  This film is long, boring, and has no good characters.  The special effects are nice but they get boring after a while too.",1409443200,2,3154,4.474516695957821

After all of these years, this film still holds it's own in a genre filled with films trying to come close to this film. The effects must be award-winning as this kind of CGI or however they created these scenes truly pull the audience in and create some kind of emotional effect in the brain. I watched this film when it was in the theaters then recently found it again and bought it to watch again, Amazing visuals and the story-line is believable, the character's story line is believable - not the polar shift which caused this scenario.

3733471,3,B001OQCV2E,"Some films are patchworks. This is one. And it starts with the Mayan apocalypse prevision in 2012 of course

The apocalypse is coming. We know that. But we have to make it realistic and use the good old Christian myths again without saying so, at least not too obviously. So there is an explosion at the surface of the sun bigger than what has ever been witnessed before. That has the effect of making the core of the earth, or at least a greater proportion of the inner mass go up in temperature at a great speed, making this mass more fluid, hence liberating the tectonic plates and the continents.

That means earthquakes, tsunamis and so on. Our news are full of such events. Just make them bigger, more gigantic. Waves that are nearly 2,000 meters high and you have it.

Add to that Tibet and the Chinese. Noah can be repeated again: a remake of the arch and there we are. There will be three arks at the end, after the catastrophe, because we need a trinity somewhere. Without the Chinese nothing could have been done, and what's more they provided the work force, probably cheap, and the security forces to build the arks first and then to make sure only the people who have the proper passes can go on them. The world without the Chinese could not go through the apocalypse without any comfort.

The US president is black of course because in 2009 it was obvious he was.

A little bit of Buddhism does not harm but at the same time the only surviving Buddhist monk actually cheated the system with his brother, a lay person, to save their own parents, and end up saving a few more as stowaways.

Add to that a family situation and you have it all: parents divorced, the ex-wife has a new boy friend. The children of the broken marriage, a boy and a girl, are the perfect American reconstructed or recomposed family.

The catastrophe itself is nothing but special effects. They are funny, maybe impressive but certainly not frightening. So banal after all. We can imagine catastrophes of this type every day and some happen every other week.

The funny part is the end. The arks find out that only Africa has survived, with a pun on the Cape of Good Hope. Humanity started in Africa and it will start again in Africa. Marvelous. But rather simple minded.

Now and then some ethical questions are brought up, but they are so easy and the answer is so banal. In such a catastrophe those ethical questions would certainly not be the main questions. The main question would be to keep people from panicking or just plain hurting if not killing one another. It is nice to think that in such an extreme situation people would think of saving their neighbors. We can always dream.

3733546,4,B001OQCV2E,"2012's special effects effect on me (if you'll pardon my awkward phrasing) was like a diabetic falling into a vat of pancake syrup -- in other words, a major sugary high followed by a sense of intense overdose.  This film elevates the art of CGI to a whole 'nother level.  No longer will the viewer be satisfied seeing a single spaceship (or whatever) blow up while the rest of the screen is comparatively benign.  From now on, the entire screen should be filled with absolutely captivating CGI action.  I found my eyeballs pivoting right and left, up and down ... trying to capture the whole experience: buildings and bridges collapsing ... cars and trains cartwheeling through the air ... monumental!

On the other hand, for the umpteenth time, we have to endure what for my taste is a litany of typecast characters I could care less about (or should I say ""I couldn't care less about"") stuck with a standard storyline/quest sprinkled with moments supposed to trigger the viewers empathy, sympathy, disgust, etc.  You know: the usual.

I did relish the clever switcheroo between my predictable expectation that the world's governments were conspiring to build massive space-arks to save 400,000 people versus the eventual answer -- huge Noah's ark-type ships.  (I suppose the helicopter-toted giraffe, elephant, etc. would have given it away to anyone less fixated on spaceships.)  Even now, I recall being distracted by my belief that the movie was inexorably headed for a space-ark ending, which made me cringe in anticipation of ridiculously/impossibly huge rocketships blasting off.  I shudder even now thinking about a screenwriter trying to explain away the impracticability of such a thing ... besides which, where the heck would you go?  Mars?  But that's a whole 'nother movie ... done and redone!

One prominent element that stood out in my mind was what I interpreted as a ""religion is useless"" theme, emphasized by a Vatican sequence where Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling masterpiece develops a crack between Adam and God followed by the destruction of St. Peter's Basilica while the Pope is addressing a huge audience in St. Peter's Square ... with the destruction of the Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio de Janeiro and a Buddhist temple in the Himalayas providing an exclamation point (or two) to what the movie's screenwriters, director, and/or producers think about religion.  But hold on!!  There is also a scene showing a massive crowd of Muslim pilgrims making their Tawafs around the Kaaba in Mecca; however, the moviemakers seem to have made a conscious decision to NOT depict the destruction of the Kaaba and other Mecca holy places.  The contrast between the movie's treatment of Christian and Buddhist holy sites versus that afforded to Mecca strongly suggested to me that the moviemakers were deathly afraid of a potential life-threatening backlash from the Islam community ... after all, who wants to be the target of a death fatwa or a jihad.

My bottom line: Predictable characters and story thread plus the uneven treatment of religions (better to leave religion out entirely if you can't treat them all alike).  HOWEVER, the nonstop visual effects more than make up for those shortcomings ... at least to the extent that I will get the DVD or Blu-Ray disc just to see how the special effects were done.",1388966400,,3341,5.010849909584087

I enjoy both John Cusack and Amanda Peet as actors. It was nice that they were together in this film.

So, since we're in 2013, and I hear they even recently bulldozed one of those Mayan temples, let me just say, there's nothing worth seeing in this movie..unless you've always wanted to see Los Angeles go a block at a time...

The cast led by John Cusack (as Jackson Curtis) is great! The directing by Roland Emmerich (who also co-wrote the story and screenplay and produced) (he also wrote the story and screenplay and directed ""Stargate"" (1994), ""Independence Day"" (1996, also executive produced), ""Godzilla"" (1998, also executive produced), ""The Day After Tomorrow"" (2004, also produced), ""10,000 B.C."" (2008, also produced), he also directed ""The Patriot"" (2000, also executive produced) is great! The story and screenplay by Emmerich & Harald Kloser (who also did the music and produced), (he also did the music to ""AVP: Alien Vs. Predator"" (2004), ""The Day After Tomorrow"", he also did the story, screenplay and music to ""10,000 B.C."", which, he also executive produced, as well) is great!

The music by Kloser & Thomas Wander (who also did the music to ""The Day After Tomorrow"" & ""10,000 B.C."", with Kloser) is great! The cinematography by Dean Semler (who also did the cinematography to ""Appaloosa"" (2008) & the upcoming ""Secretariat"" (2010) is great!

Elliot (who also did the film editing to ""Fantastic Four: The Rise Of The Silver Surfer"" (2007), was also a visual effects editor and additional editor on ""The Day After Tomorrow"", visual effects editor on ""Independence Day"" & ""Godzilla"", additional editor on ""Stargate"") is great! The casting by April Webster (who also did the casting to ""Stargate"", ""Godzilla"", ""The Patriot"", & ""The Day After Tomorrow"") is great! The production design by Barry Chusid (who also did the art direction to ""The Patriot"", the production design to ""Daredevil"" (2003), ""The Day After Tomorrow"" & ""Serenity"" (2005) is great! The art direction by Ross Dempster (who also did the art direction to ""Miracle"" (2004) & the upcoming ""Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief"" (2010), Kendelle Elliott (who also did the art direction to ""Dreamcatcher"" (2003) & the upcoming ""The Cabin In The Woods"" (2011), Dan Hermansen (who also did the art direction to the upcoming ""Percy Jackson & The Olympians: The Lightning Thief"" & ""The Imaginarium Of Doctor Parnassus"" (2009) & Don Macaulay (who also did the art direction to ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" (2008) (supervising art director) is great! The set decoration by Elizabeth Wilcox (who also did the set decoration to ""Fantastic Four"" (2005), ""Fantastic Four: The Rise Of The Silver Surfer"", ""The Day The Earth Stood Still"" & the upcoming ""The A-Team"" (2010) is great!

The best portions of the production happen during the first half of the movie when the greatest destruction takes place. Sometimes it looks pretty spectacular, and our hats should come off to a very well done choreography of mammoth special effects. There is some other good news too. Cusack does indeed rise to the occasion and provides a decent performance though he has a run of the mill disaster script to work with. I was very surprised to see the great George Seagal in a rare cameo too. I had thought maybe he had passed on. In the 70's he was a pretty successful actor, so it was nice to see him again. Somehow though this picture has far less impressive special effects than Emmerich's Independence day, but none the less this the film is missing the over all better story, characters and plot that still makes ID a superior film. But then this film is far better than the dreadful Day After Tomorrow. But let's not get too big for our pants and maybe we should be thankful that we do have a director who can manage a decent disaster film. Emmerich is Our present day Ronald Neame and Irwin Allen rolled into one. I mean someone with a flair for big budget disaster has to be there to give us films like The Poseidon Adventure and The Towering Inferno or it would simply be unamerican don't you think? Emmerich does indeed know how to make the destruction of the world look ok I guess, all be it, shamefully over the top in this instance. And he follows suit perfectly too with basically dry and contrived scripts just as disaster films had in the 1970s. Maybe it's run dry dude!

3733734,4,B001OQCV2E,"2012, now being behind us, the movie of the same year evolves into pure entertainment.

Prophecies, Biblical and otherwise, are intertwined and in some cases even suggestively linked, which  create a certain validity for the telling of the tale. Thus, even some events that are actually prophesied to take place are related in various forms.

The script has Woody Harrelson's character, played superbly by the actor who has seasoned his half-wit role from 'Cheers', run many of the major prophecies, both true and heretical, together becoming slants on the same happening.

As entertainment, the film is quite enjoyable. Solid acting plays through plausible developments.

As often as Hollywood spoofs many end time prophecies, '2012' nevertheless takes a realistic look at one scenario that was given for the world's end.

3733735,5,B001OQCV2E,"2012: A very moving, fantastic special effects, fast paced great syfy that I thoroughly enjoyed.  I purchased the regular DVD and then Bluray; this is a must own and see. (Director: Roland Emmerich; Writers: Roland Emmerich, Harald Kloser. Stars: Danny Glover, Woody Harrelson, Tom McCarthy, John Cusack, Thandie Newton and Chiwetel Ejiofor (and other great actors and actresses) performed their parts quite well.  This movie is extremely inclusive of all nationalities and for this we should be proud. Had to include additional information of the 2012 because there was another 2012 which was intentionally non inclusive and had only one ethnic group involved; again, removing all people of color. I was so taken aback that I didn't watch the entire movie but enough to know it was worthless and a total waste of time. The acting was cheesy, unbelievable, failed totally to even approach reality and completely clumsy in its presentation as well.

Castatrophic events of the world naturally involve people of all colors in every aspect of life which include scientists, inventors, etc. It has been proven over and over again and again that one ethnic group does not have all the answers but that when we work together we can accomplish what is needed. This movies shows us that on all levels.

Attempts to hold other groups down prevent the dominant group from rising. In all aspects of life the world would have been much farther along if the dominant group had not held people of color down. WORK TOGETHER PEOPLE and we all rise together.",1366675200,,1541,4.961240310077519

3733737,3,B001OQCV2E,"It was good to see George Segal again after all these years (for me). If he can do this well in his late 70's, he should be OK for a few years more if he wants to work. Most of the starring and featured players, as a matter of fact, deserve a pat on the back for having the courage to do their best in the face of the greatest adversity (that is, the script).
Actually, quite a good film rests within this mess. All it would have taken was to hire a halfway decent film doctor (they must have these counterparts to Broadway's famed play doctors), give him a quiet room and a secretary (a word processor if he prefers that), and a very blunt edged permanent marker. Preserving nearly all the visual aspects (though rearranging parts), being truly vicious with the marker on the the first hour and forty five minutes of the script, and completely rewriting the last 40 minutes, would have given them, well, almost, a first rate film. Shortening it by thirty minutes would not be a bad idea either, but there may be financial reasons for the length of the movie that are not visible to the uninformed mind. I can only say what others have said, it is unnecessarily long; no editing without altering that, can truly help. I have a particular gripe about the ""noble"" actions of the President of the United States and the leaders of other major powers, as well as the chief science advisor to the President (Chiwetel Ejiofor), but speaking of their truly fantastical speeches and action would involve revealing some features of that long last segment of the film, which is just not done. Of course, I blame not the actors but the screenwriters, for the awful hogwash that is put in their mouths. Mr. Ejiofor has my particular sympathy, since he must carry most of the
load in this regard.
I have no advice for the potential viewer save that he or she pay the least possible money to see the film In that way, you will be able to enjoy the catastrophe segments and the fairly numerous OK plot lines, and bear with the rest. Of course, many reviewers ""loved it"", gave  it five stars, and you might be one of them.

3733754,3,B001OQCV2E,"Roland Emmerich is the king of disaster movies. On 9/11 as the entire world watched buildings tumble, the universal response on everyone's lips was ""it's just like Independence Day!"" He's done it again with this film -- a terrifying, mind-blowing epic in which the earth has a major meltdown.

Few people know what is about to happen but the few that do become powerful. Top scientists have been sensing the earth's core heating and predict that in 2012 the earth's crust will shift -- forever rearranging the continents and creating mass devastation that will result in a global apocalypse. Believing the populace should be warned of the impending disaster, Dr. Adrian Hemsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) pleads with his superiors to release a statement in the wake of recent tremors... cracks have appeared in seaside states and he does not think it is right that only the wealthy people who can afford a ticket on the ships they have designed to withstand the judgment are to be saved. Unfortunately, global leaders disagree -- even though our president (Danny Glover) has serious misgivings about it. His daughter (Thandie Newton) has been employed in saving priceless pieces of art, although she is unaware of the reason why.

Meanwhile, the ignorant masses know something is happening but not what -- and it is purely by chance that Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) catches on. During a camping trip to Yellowstone National Park with his kids, he happens to hear the local ""nutcase"" on the radio predicting what will happen. The signs are all around him and fortunately, he takes them seriously -- but will it be enough to save his family when there is literally nowhere to run? From start to finish, this movie captivates you -- not only with its astounding visual effects (which manage to be both incredible and alarming -- there is nothing more horrific than watching a tidal wave smash an overturned military ship upside-down onto the White House) but its constant pace. It never lags in spite of being well over two hours in length and it manages to emotionally invest us in the lives of a dozen different characters, even though some of them do not get much screen time. The cast is perfect, the script is good, and in terms of being a visual epic it succeeds.

The one thing that makes me hesitate is that in spite of being glued to my flat screen for the duration, in the back of my mind was the realization that I was watching billions of people die as a form of entertainment. Even though it is just a film and not real, it's still hard to comprehend the entire world's population perishing in a multitude of horrific ways -- drowning, falling into cracks in the earth, being smashed by tumbling pieces of rock, or crushed underneath toppling buildings. In a world where we have actually seen these atrocities, it seems insensitive in a way -- but that aside, apart from those thematic events the film is surprisingly appropriate. Major disasters unfold and people die, some of them main characters -- a few we see their fate and others' fates are implied. Do not expect everyone you are introduced to in the course of the film to make it. Buildings fall, volcanoes erupt, cruise liners overturn, planes go down, and much more. None of it is explicit so much as disturbing. There is some scattered profanity, an f-word you cannot hear (it's mouthed), and about eight abuses of GD and one or two of Jesus' name. One character flips another off. Sensuality is limited to a man suggesting to a woman that they ""make a baby."" There are numerous references to religion, some reverent and others dismissive. (Priests and masses gathered at the Vatican for prayer are crushed beneath it when it falls.)

Family is at the core of this film, since everything Jackson does is ultimately to save his ex-wife and kids -- and even his ex-wife's boyfriend. There are also numerous instances of selflessness in which various people die saving someone else (or in one case, saving a dog!). This is contrasted with astonishing selfishness on the part of certain figures in the cabinet. The ending message is that humanity is nothing if it loses its compassion for other human beings. Even when the visuals had faded and I breathed a sigh of relief at the end, it was that more than anything that I remembered. It's not for the faint of heart and if the thought of mass casualties turns your stomach I would recommend skipping it, but for those looking to sit on the edge of their seats for two and a half hours, this one is a thrill ride.",1363824000,,4524,4.708333333333333

3733761,1,B001OQCV2E,"Sure am glad my neighbor loaned me his copy so I didn't have to pay for this mess.

It seemed to be disjointed throughout, as if the director had more of a vision to see how many disaster scenes he could cram into this rather than taking any time to develop any of the characters. The characters never seem to connect and the acting was rather stilted and juvenile.

I also found it to be very unrealistic. The main hero seemed to spend about 1/2 the movie driving some type of vehicle a hair breadth away from being swallowed up by the crumbling terrain behind him. It was also a stretch when he left his 7 year old daughter behind in a camper, seconds away from disaster, so he could climb a hill to speak to a radio jock - I do not believe any loving father would ever leave his child behind in such a situation, I'm a Dad and wouldn't even consider laeving my daughter in a dangerous situation. And his co-hero buddy, the doctor, who had a few hours flying lessons, is suddenly a capable twin engine pilot before going on to be the co-pilot in a Soviet Anotov cargo plane - one of the largest planes in the world. Then there are countless scenes taking place in foreigh countries with the actors speaking those languages but they don't bother with any subtitles so the viewer has no idea what is being said or how it pertains to the movie - they would have been better off having these scene with the actors speaking English, at least we would know what's happening. There is more but it is a pain to bring up additional scenes from a lackluster movie.

Overall, this whole movie stretches the bounds of believability to the point where they snap about 1/2 way through. I know this was supposed to be a depiction of what the seers predicted of the great 21st Century Hoax of the Mayan prophecy but it didn't even do that well. It was just stretched too long, done too poorly and very disjointed.",1361318400,2,1899,4.358757062146893

In conclusion this movie does achieve one of its sought after goals if the singular message to be taken from this film was to warn  people of mankinds destructive nature and how abuse of our most invaluable resource is ultimately going to lead to our demise than a prime example has been made.

The point is what the people do is how people react in disaster situations. Do they help each other so the most people can survive with the best chance of long term survival for all? Or do they just look out for themselves and sabotage everyone else so they have a greater chance of survival without having to share, the shortsighted view. This movie could be any lifeboat type of film and set any similar situation, other than this Science Fiction one.

3733889,5,B001OQCV2E,"So, when the world ends, it's the politicians and bureaucrats that we're gonna save.

Yeah, sounds like a really bad idea for so MANY reasons.

Meanwhile, the writers and the artists and the spiritual leaders are left behind to deal with the apocalypse. That was the most depressing element of the movie. What will the world look like if we only save the ""important people"" in Washington? Heaven help us. Seriously. If the future world is to be populated with the slimy-dog politicians and their ilk, I think I'll take my chances with eternal life, thank you very much.

Sitting in the darkened theater watching 2012, I was reminded of ""The Bunker"" at White Sulphur Springs (in West Virginia). Construction on the 110,000-square-foot bunker was started under Eisenhower's watch, when we were worried that the USSR might blow us up into lots of radioactive pieces. Turns out, our beloved elected officials were prepared to push The Red Button that'd end the world as we know it, and then turn-tail and run into their bunker, slam the blast-proof door behind them and emerge 90 days later when the danger had passed. And the most amazing part: The Bunker is outfitted with gee-whiz features that'd lead the unsuspecting public to believe the lawmakers were still comfortably ensconced in Washington, DC. In other words, The Bunker was *designed* to perpetrate a fraud on the American people.

Watching ""2012"" I thought about The Bunker and realized, this movie is probably right. If and when the world ends, it'll be the politically important that are given seats on the lifeboats. And it's probably right that if there is a cataclysmic event, the Powers That Be will not tell the unwashed masses what's going on, lest they try and steal one of those seats on the lifeboat.

That's just depressing on so many levels.

But I digress.

This movie is definitely impressive on the big screen, and the soundtrack has plenty of bass (which I like). But the script and the writing was a little sappy for my tastes. And as to believability - well - this movie fell short on that score, too. I don't want to spoil the plot, but NO ONE can drive a limousine *that* well. On the plus side, the graphics are truly amazing and scarier than anything I've ever seen before. I had to turn away from the screen to avoid some of the scary-as-hell images. It's a pretty intense flick, and it does a good job of drawing you in.

A nice side effect: After watching this movie, I'm a lot less worried about getting those pesky credit cards paid off. Does make you think a little more about enjoying every day, and appreciating the simple beauty in our world.

In conclusion, it's an interesting flick with awe-inspiring graphics, and it'll hold your attention - if you can suspend disbelief for a couple hours.",1356652800,,2786,4.727835051546392

3733947,1,B001OQCV2E,"Spoiler alert (as though anything I write could spoil this cinematic debacle further than its creators already did).

This was arguably the most ridiculous movie I've ever seen. I borrowed the DVD from the public library, so all I wasted was time.

Anyone who has even had a smattering of elementary physics will realize that the premise was downright silly: As a result of unusual solar activity, the level of neutrinos (a sub-atomic particle) reaching the earth greatly increases, and ""mutate"" into ""something like microwaves"", thus transforming the earth into a gigantic microwave oven, with the crust melting in many places and continents shifting thousands of miles.

And all of this was predicted millennia ago by the Mayans. And happens every 640,000 years, also. How people and animals could have survived the earlier ones was not explained.

The special effects were great but applied absurdly. The earth splits open and/or shoots fireballs, chasing the main characters at whatever speed they happen to be running, driving or flying away - a scenario repeated four times! Tsunamis cause waves thousands of feet high. An aircraft carrier at least ten times larger than life crushes the White House and half of Washington, DC. In a cheap name-dropping scene, an ark full of survivors lightly crashes into Mt. Everest.

The movie does not even fulfill its promise that the world will end. Hundreds of thousands of ""genetically chosen"" (and/or moneyed) individuals survive the catastrophe, and after just one year afloat in their arks are ready to emerge to live happily ever after.

The best thing I can say about this ""disaster film"" (the film is the disaster) is that I cracked up at the absurdity of the whole thing. If you must see it, borrow it, but don't waste your money buying it.",1353974400,2,1794,4.983277591973244

3733966,1,B001OQCV2E,"I know, walking into one of these disaster films, that they tend to be really stupid.  You can't get away from that fact.  They are mostly nonsensical and require a boatload of suspension of disbelief.  Roland Emmerich's name in general also doesn't instill much confidence, and yet, he's helmed a few noteworthy entries in the catalog of disaster films.  I mean, the genre as a whole is usually under thought and over produced, and yet we all love ourselves some mindless explosions every once in a while.  Emmerich himself has given us Independence Day, Godzilla and The Day After Tomorrow, and while none of those films are `great', they are certainly entertaining for the genre being considered.

Why Emmerich felt the need to make this film, when he had previously made The Day After Tomorrow, which is similarly structured, is beyond me.

The idea of the end of the world coming in 2012 is not a new one.  It is largely misquoted and misapplied in this film, but who cares.  The general idea is that the planets align and the world is destroyed and starts over basically and so this film takes us on a journey following a fractured family as they work together to weather the storm so-to-speak and mend broken bridges.

This film is terrible.

The general idea is decent yet hugely overproduced to the point where the visuals aren't even interesting anymore.  Watching LA implode was redundant and watching the limo fly through the air and swerve out of harm's way was ridiculous to the point of unintentional comedy.  In fact, almost all the visuals were laced with so much preposterousness that they wound up heavily detracting from the film.  Not to mention that the human dynamics were sappy and dumbed down, the endless barrage of rekindled family goodbyes was simply boring and pointless and the ridiculous connection between the end of the world and this washed up author's book (and the love affair Ejiofor's character has with it) is silly, pretentious and nauseating.  The acting is also all really poor, with the usually fascinating Ejiofor sapping all the life out of this film with his overacting and Woody Harrelson serving up one of the most ridiculous performances I've seen in years.  Oh, and Zlatko Buric is just gross, which brings me to the fact that this film is also offensively racist in parts, but whatever.

The predictability of the whole thing is also bizarrely obvious (whoever things that Gordon has a chance of survival when he stands in the way of Jackson and Kate rekindling their happy family is an idiot) and the final scene of suspense (and that collision with Mount Everest) was just overdone and silly.

This whole movie was silly.

3733967,1,B001OQCV2E,"The Book of Revelation this is NOT for those likely to assume the movie is an adequate description of events portrayed there.  It is better viewed as hyperbolic post-modernism in which Nostradamas quatrains are integrated into a fixed calendar endpoint a la Mayan.  So, it's the atypical neutrino behavior that is behind the Earth's crust/core overheating and subsequent liquifaction/shift?  Nonscientists in the audience can be duped into believing this is a plausible scenario which is why Hollywood uses it as its point of departure.

And, how about the competing themes in the movie; one espoused by the geologist in which 'representative genetic stock is selected for salvation' and the other by the crass former US presidential Chief of Staff '1 billion euros per ticket, after all we're not running a charity'?  This interplay/confusion mars the script in that the audience is left to labor under a false dichotomy pressurized by the faux ""crisis"" created by the dreaded 'End of the World'.  In fact, no one knows how this interplay would work out in fact; yet, we have examples from our own history from both 9.11.2001 response and hurricane Katrina.  Likely, short term, the fallen nature of man would be plainly evident, but what if altruism was removed entirely from the equation?  This is the view of Revelation, when fallen man is left completely to his/her own devices without the restraint of altruistic urges.

The only couple of whimsical touches in the movie is casting the actual Buddist llama of Nepal to represent himself and the attempt on the part of common Tibetans to claim a right of stowaway passage abord an exclusive, wealth- and superiority-driven Ark.",1347321600,,1682,5.065217391304348

It's all about the special effects, I suppose, although there is a complex plot (all puns intended) and some interesting characters. Danny Glover plays the President, but I didn't see any other actors or actresses I knew. One looked hauntingly familiar, a rich man named Carl Anhauser who was some sort of government official, who turns out to be played by Oliver Platt. Hippie-dippie pirate radio announcer and conspiracy buff Charlie Frost was played by Woody Harrelson.

Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) took his children to Yosemite National Park to do some hiking and came across a secret government installation. They are spotted by Charlie Frost in the restricted area, and as soon as they emerge and their Army escort has left, Frost stops them to ask what the government people said. Turns out he was the voice on the radio they had heard on the drive up there, and he tells Jackson what he knows about the secret program around the fact that the world is scheduled to blow up, and Yosemite is about to become an active volcano.

This is, however, not the beginning of the movie. First we see a bunch of officials and scientists from 2008 onward, reacting to the scientist who has conclusively shown that the unprecedented solar activity has emitted a new sort of neutrino that is heating up the earth's core.

It's all earthquakes and buildings falling down and bridges collapsing and tidal waves, and even some humor here and there. It's non-stop action, and the audience can't help wondering if anyone at all will survive, and if so, how? Through a series of hair-raising close calls and miraculous escapes, incredible courage, and some very sophisticated technology, all done at a break-neck pace. I was exhausted by the time it was over.",1336694400,,1907,4.82262996941896
3734016,5,B001OQCV2E,"This moive has it all: complete world destruction, amateur acting, iffy special effects and lousy plot. And it entertains from start to end.  You laugh all the way through it. I was on my seat with animated suspense, laughing at its silliness, corny lines and two bit cliches.  Its up there with the great cheese of apocalypse movies: Deep Impact, The End of Tomorrow and The Divide.  What's even greater about this movie is that it did not attempt to explain the mystic dribble of the Mayan hypothesis.  What a pile of crap that theory is.  I laughed the loudest when Danny Glover overacted his main line with too much emotionality to the leaders of all nations: ""Its the end of the world."" It just had to be said.

Just a side note: apocalypse films are magnets for the amateur.  Don't really understand why viewers still expect class acting in them, but then again, maybe someday someone will produce an apocalypse flick that can be classified as real cinema.  Maybe they still have hope. 2012 certainly isn't one.",1336521600,3,1017,4.674157303370786
3734017,4,B001OQCV2E,"I realize the Hollywood literati will look down on this movie, for its over-reliance on special effects (Las Vegas strip falling into a massive earthquake crevasse?  cool!) and predictable dialog.  But I never really felt this movie was trying to be more than it is; namely, a tremendously entertaining end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it roller coaster ride.  Same with Steven King or John Grisham:  they'll never be Nobel Prize contenders . . . . but we like them, because they know, just as we do, that they're not the next Shakespeare, and they don't try to pretend otherwise.  Same with this movie.

What I liked:  Characters were an excellent cross-section of society: ex-spouses sharing custody, Russian mafia, self-serving politicians, and my personal favorite:  the off-the-grid survivalist radio host played by Woody Harrelson. I thought the last scene (no spoilers, but it involves some big structures inside a mountain) was really cool and interesting, made me wonder if we could really pull that off.  Some people are not fans of John Cusack, but I thought he was authentic and believable in this movie.  And special effects were off-the-hook, as many other reviews have noted.

What I didn't like:  Not much honestly. As I said, I did not expect Out of Africa or Citizen Kane, so I wasn't disappointed that it didn't change my life.  OK, some of the subplots were cliche (the Russian bimbo and her dog, the lone politician with a conscience), and some of the dialog was less-than-brilliant.

But the over-the-top CG, the quirky characters, and the what-if scenario of how the connected & powerful go about saving themselves as the world goes down the drain, all these were worth the price of admission.  I'm adding this one to my movie library.",1336262400,,1753,5.017301038062284

I doubt that whatever I missed would have made what I did watch, worth it!! Usually when I don't finish a movie or a book it bugs me that I have to eventually complete it but I don't at all feel this way in this case.

3734035,5,B001OQCV2E,"...this will be a sci-fi classic watched over and over.

2001 was trashed when it first came out. Starship Troopers, Armageddon, 2010, so many others...were all given poor reviews when they first came out. All became insanely CLASSIC flicks watched by sci-fi fans every time they appeared on cable.

This movie is no different. Fantastic, and I mean FANTASTIC (if not totally science correct)special effects ROCK in this film. Don't let some of the cheesy Hollywood type theatrics (ending) get in the way. There are so many big names in this film that make this film fun to watch. Everything except the kitchen sink is thrown in to make this movie one of the best `end of the world' films ever made. The Woody Harrelson scenes (as the lunatic who transmits live as Yellowstone explodes) are eye-popping (and the spot where he pulls his pants up to cover butt crack when the caldera finally blows is a nice comic bit). I love the Chinese working faster and more efficiently to create immense life boat arks....makes a sideways slap statement about the USA lacking the ability to respond to disasters in the current world environment. The Tibetan mountain scenes, the destruction of L.A. the west coast cities sliding into the Pacific Ocean, the pyroclastic cloud taking out Las Vegas while CG, are done so brilliantly, the destruction of Washington D.C. and the Vatican....so graphic they look real. By the way, Cusack is excellent in this flick. So is Danny Glover as the U.S. president who goes down with his country (crushed by an aircraft carrier atop a HUGE tidal wave). Oliver Pratt plays a great A-hole politician, and George Segal tugs the emotional strings.

You've all seen the movie by now. My review is years late, but I just wanted to put my 2 cents out there. Watch this for the incredible special effects, especially in HD, with 5.1 sound (7.1 is WAY better). While I watch this over and over on the FXHD channel, my blu-ray version is so much cleaner and sharper.",1329868800,56,1978,4.760932944606414

I mean there are quite a few illogical moments but they do not affect the entertaining value of this movie. The special effects are much superior to others of the same genre. They look real, spectacular and scary. There are some scenes with depth and emotion too. For example, the scenes where the rich paid billion of dollars to be hauled to safety while the poor were left behind.

In short, it's the FATHER of all disaster movies so far in terms of special effects and entertaining.",1328745600,2,577,4.538461538461538
3734038,3,B001OQCV2E,"Like most of Roland Emmerich's movies, this one deals with massive destruction on a Global scale. The difference this time being that the destruction level is ramped up to eleven. Unlike previous films, in this massive tsunamis and unfathomable seismic activity take out much of the planet's inhabitants. No one is safe. Entire continents melt into the ocean. The whole state of California slides into the western seaboard, and yellowstone park becomes the world's largest Volcano. To top it all off there is an excellent sequence where the White House, now converted to a shelter, is wiped out by the USS John F. Kennedy. All this is great.

Most of the events I described, in fact pretty much the entirity of the devestation takes place roughly in the first forty-five minutes to an hour. After the first hour the film's quality takes a noticeable nose dive. Without the cgi and special effects we're left to an old hat to carry the film; the story. Problem is, with the world coming to an end someone must have forgotten to write one.

The film sports a great cast, I can't think of anyone I would ditch, but some of their stories make them seem largely irrelevant. For example, the main character played by John Cusack has no real connections to Chiwetel Ejiofor or the people planning for this event. His main connection comes from Woody Harrelson, who plays a coot he makes the fortunate choice of listening to. They should've given him stronger ties to the characters in Washington. As a result the story in Washington serves a mere exposition so we have some idea as to how John Cusack and his family can save themselves.

Next is the main story, the John Cusack story...if you didn't smell it coming...is a...you guess it...divorced father trying to win back his kids. Okay, seriously, didn't your writer or team of writers ever express some desire not to use what's been used in basically every disaster movie? How many times did he want the word ""cliche'"" used to describe this one?

Some of it is very good, I imagine some of their observations about the crassness of our Governments and how money would buy a chance at survival were very on point. I particularly like how they handled Danny Glover's President Wilson. Sadly, in the past, Roland Emmerich has delivered sharper stories that were not so all over the place.

The special effects are good (though the green-screening is not up to the effects). Some are outstanding. But this movie requires a lot more than suspension of disbelief. It requires a full lobotomy. Absurdly bad.

Then again, who needs a plot when you have a budget of $200 million and a really terrible but really well-connected director? The saddest part is that Danny Glover, John Cusack, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Oliver Platt, and Woody Harrelson are phenomenal actors and the rest of the cast is fine; it's just the filmmaking that really sucks.",1326758400,,779,4.849624060150376
3734056,4,B001OQCV2E,"...for now. In a year's time this film is going to seem extremely out of date. The end of the world plot is ludicrous, but it might have been easier if no mention of the Mayan calendar was made. The legend is obviously nonsense, and it would have been a much less silly film if it stood on its own two feet, independent of such bad science.

John Cusack (who is surprisingly good here) plays a failed, but good, writer working as a Limo driver for a wealthy Russian bully. When camping with his estranged kids in Yellowstone he discovers that the Caldera, the San Andreas Fault, and the rest of the world, are about to go down. What follows is more than 2 hours of utterly insane set-pieces, split-second escapes, breathtaking visual effects (which, for once, don't offend the eye), and lots and lots and lots of mega-destruction as Cusack and his family flee from the crumbling world beneath their feet by multiple means of improvised transportation. You've never seen a spectacle like this before, and it raises the bar ex-treme-ly high for any and all disaster flicks that might follow. Emmerich certainly knows how write action scenes.

Chiwetel Ejiofor (also not as annoying as he usually is), Oliver Platt, Danny Glover, and Woody Harrelson fill out the rest of an expansive cast as the scientists, President, and Art Bell-style conspiracy theorist. I'm glad that the politics were played down and the 'harsh truths' angle was left unchallenged for the most part. Like The Day After Tomorrow, there are no winners here, but I am beginning to notice a recurring theme among Roland Emmerich's work. It seems that he believes that our world as it is is so broken, corrupted, and irredeemable that the only way to save it is to wipe the slate clean and rise again as one species unrestricted by political or ethnic divides. So, in a way, it's a good ending despite billions being dead.

I fear that this might become dated and unwatchable in the future, which is a shame since it's definitely Emmerich's best film. Independence Day is a relic of 90s optimism and the polar opposite of 2012, which deserves better. Only time will tell I guess. If we are all still here come January 1st 2013, then perhaps we should be grateful.

It isn't exactly reality TV, but then I don't watch movies for the realism; I watch them to be entertained...to be swept out of my living room and into a scene that makes a great Sci-Fi adventure.  This movie does that.

The story revolves around your average divorced family where the father hasn't had enough time for the kids, and the mother and stepfather are perfect parents.  The tween-age son calls his father by his first name rather than Dad, an effort to show his disconnection and disappointment.  The disaster that ensues gives the real father (John Cusack) the opportunity to be the hero in the story.  So is it just me or is this the exact storyline for War of the Worlds with Tom Cruise?  Couldn't somebody have told the writer that that scenario had already been taken?  Enough said about that.

There's a little bit of a science lesson in the movie, not unlike The Day After Tomorrow, and what scientists thought would someday destroy the earth many years from now suddenly fast forwards to a few hours away.  Volcanoes explode, the earth's faults crack wide open, and the oceans stir up tsunamis...you could say in Biblical proportions.  That said, think a Noah's Ark scenario.  I won't tell all and give it away.

The thought-provoking part of this movie lies in the who-gets-to-be-saved question.  Have you ever wondered if the rich and important would have an edge up on the rest of us if something like this really did happen?  Is somebody out there preparing a way for a select few to survive?  This movie may stir up some thought on that.

I don't think this is a GREAT movie, any more than I thought The Day After Tomorrow or Independence Day were GREAT.  But my husband and I have watched all of these many times because they are action-packed movies with terrific edge-of-your-seat special effects and entertaining actors.",1323388800,2,1967,4.685131195335277

The writers seemed to have one theme; make any encounter with anything as close as possible to the point of being unbelievable.....and then repeat it about 50 times! Add millions in digital effects and there's your movie!
Both airplanes would have ""conked out"" as soon as any of the volcanic ash reached it. And the vehicles, give me a break. Both the father and daughter would have broken their backs when landing in a flimsy motor home, but it didn't even blow a tire!

3734067,5,B001OQCV2E,"The first time I saw this movie, I hated it...because the science was so screwed up and Roland Emmerich was still clueless as the the characteristics and capabilities of the aircraft the film portrayed.  The second time, not so much...it was, after all an action/disaster movie with good special effects.  Then I got a new home theater system and figured this would be a good movie to try it out on.  Well, its no surprise that the effects are still good and the sound is fantastic, without being over the top.  A funny thing happened.  I started looking at the characters and realized they were believable.  Once you look at the people, the movie comes together and becomes very enjoyable.

Are there flaws?  You bet.  A student pilot is not going to get into a twin engine aircraft he has never flown before and take off a minute later.  He is certainly not going to fly from Santa Monica to downtown Los Angeles and still be lower than the US Bank building.  The cargo plane called an Antonov 500 in the movie, is actually an Antonov An-225 and isn't capable of a number of the maneuvers shown in the movie.  Also, it is referred to as a Russian plane, when it is actually made in Ukraine.  I used to think things were important.  I'm reminded of two other movies, Armageddon and Deep Impact.  The former had lousy science and absurd space shuttle flying, but you gave a damn about the characters.  The latter had pretty good science, but lackluster characters.  Armageddon was the winner.

This movie gave us that cliched thing that we have seen over and over in every other natural disaster flick along with cliched dialogue and cliched characters and we are suppose to suspend reality for a moment and just be awed by the graphics that did most of the work for the film while the actors depended on them to carry the film.

The only interesting character throughout this whole fim is Woody Harrelson (who is very underrated) He is the only life support for this film but he's quickly killed off, should have made his character survive so he could have given Oliver Platt and Danny Glover's characters a piece of his mind, that would have made for more interesting dialogue than the train wreck we were subject to during this film.

There wasn't any character development at all in this film, so we could care less whether or not these people kicked the bucket or not. I'll start with the step-boyfriend who John Cusack's children loved but he was just an ass throwing out insults about the children's father right in front of the children and calling two old women ""old bags"" while trying to escape and why do the kids love someone like this? Is this someone that kids are suppose to admire and love over their own father who doesn't bad mouth anyone? The boyfriend only had like what 2 lessons in flying a plane but able to fly a small rickety plane and a huge plane with ease....GMAFB, their asses would have crashed the moment they took off.

Poor Thandie Newton who is a phenomenal actress is reduced to just standing there and being pretty. An actress like her should have been given time to shine and out perform most of the actors in this film but she's just used as a decoration in this film. She had nothing but cliched lines.

Chiwetel Elji-whatever he had his moments in the film, but wasn't enough to save the film and all his predictions didn't pan out, so he looked more like an idiot more than anything.

Danny Glover is just the soft spoke president and nothing more, he had no depth at all in this film for the presidential character, which is a shame a talented actor wasted here.

Oliver Platt was just the government bad guy, how original, you just wanted to see him get swept up by a tidal wave and clobbered by a lava rock.

The Russians were just stereotypical cliched characters with no real depth to them besides being rich and having a big plane.

John Cusack is the divorced lovable father who has the admiration of his daughter and the stuck up snotty attitude of his son who needed to get back slapped a couple of times but suddenly is nice to dad when the world is about to crumble...ok.

Amanda Peet, is just useless in this movie no real reason for her character to even much be in this film. All she did was scream and holler, you think I'm talking about while disaster is happening but no she's screaming and hollering at anything besides disaster and when her boyfriend is crushed to death by gears, she shows not one single emotion and quickly slobbers all over John Cusack like she never had a boyfriend.

Just a ridiculous movie with ridiculous characters except for Woody Harrelson.",1320624000,5,3207,4.5137931034482754
3734072,3,B001OQCV2E,"Usually I agree with the notion that special effects don't make a movie, and they can't save a bad movie.

""2012"" has a decent disaster plot at its core that gets sidetracked by being too sentimental for its own good.

The ""divorced dad who reconnects with his alienated kids during a humanity-threatening event"" subplot was handled much better in the Speilberg remake of ""War of the Worlds"".

And there are a number of lame aim-at-your-heartstrings scenes, like the Tibetan(?) monk giving the temple bell a couple last bongs before the whole monastery gets obliterated by a wall of water.

There are also some risible characters (look no further than the Russian twins) who have some equally risible lines
('Da, he can be YOUR dog too').

Still, this movie sports a look that is just stunning on Blu-ray.

The plot wasn't unique, but the characters were and I rooted for them all the way.

This movie was tongue-in-cheek believable because of the twists and turns woven into the story as John Cusack, a divorced author, tries to save his family.

The year is 2012 and it's Cusack's time with the kids, so he takes them to Yellowstone National Park  where he and his wife had visited years before. He and the children run across a chained-in area, so climb the fence and discover a dead animal beside a dried-up lake. Soldiers suddenly appear and start to take them into custody when a scientist interferes. He lets them go with a fictional explanation and a warning to keep away.

En route from the park, they meet Woody Harrelson who plays a crazy but knowledgeable conspiracy theorist who explains that it's the end of the world and the earth's core is deteriorating. They think he's kooky when he says he's staying on ""the mountain"" to watch the fireworks. Harrelson is marvelous in this role; a real natural.

They're isolated when the earth starts to fall apart, exactly as some scientists had predicted two years previously. The government made secret plans to save some of the population, mostly politicians, but didn't put it into effect until almost too late. The earth's crust is already cracking all around the world, even as Cusack heads out of the park with his children.

The children are back home with his ex-wife and her boyfriend by the time Cusack realizes the seriousness of the situation. Meanwhile, back in Washington, the President, played by Danny Glover, and his chief scientist are having a battle with his advisors about the President's desire to inform the public about the coming disaster.

I've never seen such a mad, dramatic, picturesque dash to get back to save his family than when Cusack drives a car with buildings collapsing all around him, huge vehicles dropping in front of him, houses swallowed by the ground. Awesome scenes...

And that's just the beginning of the destruction: the Washington monument crumbles and falls, the Eiffel Tower goes down, the Basilica in Rome is completely destroyed, and similar scenes occur all around the world. The only safe place at that point is in the air, it seems, and places where devastation has not yet reached. I was flabbergasted by the scenes when Cusack finally gets his family to a plane and they manage to take off: below them the earth appears to be devouring itself with trees sucked down, mountains toppling and the water over the ocean rising and receding with hurricane force, even reaching as high as the plane. Frightening, yet eerily beautiful to watch.

Sure, Cusack and his family are barely missed by falling debris, narrowly escaping large sink-holes and fire-balls over and over again; too many times to be believable. But that's what makes it so exciting! Anyway, it's only a movie and I was rooting so hard for that little family, at that point I believed because I wanted to believe.

John Cusack delivers a truly believable acting job...as does Glover, Amanda Peet, the kids and all the cast. I cared so much for them and some others in the cast that I was emotionally involved; I related to them.

That's why I find it so hard to believe how many low marks this movie received from Amazon reviewers. To me it's a blockbuster and should receive acting and graphic awards.

One reviewer called this movie ""silly,"" but I totally disagree. My hat's off to the actors, writers, the special effects people, the producers, the editor, director and everyone involved. I repeat: love this movie.

3734085,4,B001OQCV2E,"I bought this DVD from a club & couldn't wait to see it. The movie itself is very entertaining, suspenseful, great characterizations, involved the viewer in each person's story or perspective, and the actors all did excellent work--making their parts believable, except for one scene that was deleted & only shown in special features, when Ejiofor learns his Dad is still alive (alternate ending), the acting is not credible in that scene only. Harrelson is fantastic as a crazy but knowledgeable conspiracy theorist who wants to go out with a bang, or should I say a burn? Cusack is, as always, amazingly real in all his scenes, as is Glover, Peet & the rest of the cast. If the story, especially the ending, is a bit unbelievable, chalk it up to it being fiction & let it go.

However, the one part that really deserves only 1 star if any, is the special effects (and lack of special features--no making of or special effects how-to's, etc). In nearly every scene the CGI is the worst I've ever seen, cartoonish even, and so obviously fake that it pulled me out of the movie nearly every CGI scene. I don't understand why since Emmerich's other movies, such as Independence Day, were awesome in effects. So what happened in this movie? The arks are obviously tiny models in a tub of water, nothing at all real about them & I've seen 12 year old's do better work on youtube. With the technology available today, even 3 years ago, there's no excuse for such poor graphic production design. In all of the action sequences, CGI is not at all credible, nor is the story line in most of these sequences, such as just getting lucky when buildings are falling all around them, or fire bombs hit everything but them, or Cusack is swallowed up in a sink hole miles deep yet somehow emerges without a scratch or a wrinkle.

The emotional involvement is definitely great work on the actors & writers parts, the viewer cares about these people & can't look away until the last second of the movie ending--no bathroom or snack breaks, the suspense keeps the viewer glued throughout the movie. The premise is believable, the research & facts are well done, the cinematography spectacular, if only the effects, graphics & CGI had been in any way tolerable this would have been a blockbuster of a movie. I'd recommend renting instead of buying.",1313020800,,2329,4.664233576642336
3734086,3,B001OQCV2E,"I'm sure this could be titled ""John Cusack Saves the World... without really doing anything"".  The Emmerich brothers are well known for their love of big budget disaster epics, with ""Independence Day"", ""Godzilla"", and ""The Day After Tomorrow"" already on their resumes.  It should come as no surprise that they would use the myth of the Mayan calendar predicting the end of the world in the year 2012 as fertile soil for their latest and `greatest' blow-em-up film.

  In ""2012"", there appears to be some sort of solar confluence causing the Earth's mantle to melt, leading to catastrophic shifts in its tectonic plates.  This change is supposed to be caused by increased neutrino activity from the sun (which, of course, cannot possibly have this effect... but you'll need to go to the ""Bad Astronomy"" web site for all the ways the science goes haywire in this film).

  Of course, while all this catastrophic activity is going on, absentee husband/father, John Cusack, must frantically drive (and fly) around to save his kids, ex-wife, and her new boyfriend.  And he must do this while meeting a typical `quirky' array of disaster film characters (the goofy conspiracy theorist no one believes; the rich magnate who knows more than he is letting on; and the earnest do-gooder who is trying to do what's `right' amidst the crisis).

  Crisp plots and three-dimensional characters have never been a hallmark of Emmerich films.  These little pieces of exposition are just necessary evils for them to pass the time between explosions.  However, unlike the cynicism of Michael Bay films, the Emmerichs at least try to see the good in humanity amid a crisis (even if it is the most laughable ways possible).  I enjoyed watching this film.  Even though it is overly long and the conclusion drags on forever, the film is basically an enjoyable time-waster.

  One directors' trademark is their inability to create a truly reprehensible villain (other than the faceless disaster).  They try to make out Oliver Platt to be this heartless bureaucrat only out for his own hide.  Yet, his actions and opinions make a lot more sense and are infinitely more practical the wide-eyed (and angry) naivety of the geologist played by Chiwetel Ejiofor (who I expected more from given the power of other roles he has been in).

  Woody Harrelson is amusing as the conspiracy theorist who has it all figured it out.  Danny Glover is just laughable as the president.  But, it is the plot involving Cusack saving his family that gives the most head-scratching.  They are in a rush to get from place to place to avoid the disaster, but they always seem to stop at the oddest moments; whether it is to admire a plane, watch birds flying away, or to stop their vehicle far enough away from one plane so that it sets up another in a series of ridiculous close class.  On top of that, Cusack's character really isn't that likeable.  He's very detached from the other characters (even his wife and kids) and you can almost understand why his wife left him in the first place.

  But, I digress.  I'm not looking for the works of Shakespeare in an Emmerich film.  I'm just looking for solid entertainment in the movie theaters and good background noise when it comes on cable at home.  ""2012"" succeeds on both counts.",1311292800,,3286,4.805357142857143

3734089,4,B001OQCV2E,"ODE TO ROLAND EMMERICH, MASTER OF CLICHES: A SYNOPSIS OF A YET-TO-BE SUMMER BLOCKBUSTER

Scenes 1-22: THEY HATE OUR FREEDOM.
Evil Taliban-looking aliens steal the Bill of Rights and use it to wipe blood off of the handsome face of our commander-in-chief, whom they've kidnapped and beaten. These Taliban-aliens have also destroyed many Protestant churches using explosive-packed mini-vans hijacked from youth-league soccer weekends. In order to save our President and the world from the Taliban-aliens we turn to a retired, alcoholic, Navy fighter pilot who has one good leg, one wooden leg, a tattoo of Reagan on his left arm, and faithfully wears stars-and-bars boxer-shorts. It is an American imperative to reclaim our captured President and the Navy fighter pilot is dutifully coaxed back into uniform by an emotional speech from his old high school basketball coach. This coach, we learn, never had the opportunities that our Navy guy ""just threw away"". Under the conditions that the Navy pilot can use his old F4U Corsair and have his pet Dalmatian ""Dakota"" ride with him, he will re-enlist and join the forces to rescue the kidnapped President. In these introductory scenes, several new characters are introduced including a gruff top-brass General played by Bobby Knight and an obsequious you-can-do-it middle-brass type, played by Rudy Giulani. The navy pilot's way-too-good-looking ex-wife is also introduced. She has found a new life in suburban Maryland and she is un-ironically married to the old high-school rival of our drunk Navy pilot. A sub-plot develops in which the top-brass General's open-minded children befriend an illiterate Native American janitor much to the chagrin of their skeptical parents.

Scenes 22-28: BUILD-UP TO BATTLE.
Troops have been rallied to rescue the President. A speech is given by the gruff top-brass General on the deck of the USS World Trade Center. Prior to this speech, the General has a heart-to-heart with the illiterate Native American janitor at the urgings of the General's children. This heart-to-heart takes place on the porch-swing of the General's home in a suburban neighborhood where they filmed The Truman Show. During their chat the Native American imparts the following aphorism: ""the female rattler may hound the bear, but it cannot bear hounds."" The General seems to understand this wisdom, and he even metaphorically incorporates this image into his rallying-speech to the troops. During the General's speech our alcoholic Navy pilot is having a lapse of confidence. He is below deck looking vulnerable. Eventually he is consoled and then ignited into action by a passionate speech from his way-too-good-looking ex-wife, played by Holly Hunter who overuses her southern accent for dramatic purposes. She implores him to ""regain that Bulldog spirit"" in reference to their mutual High School Mascot from back in the day when they used to steal kisses underneath the bleachers.

Scenes 29-34: THE FINAL HOUR.
A massive air-battle is occurring in the vicinity of the alien mothership. Numerous pilot-heroes are shot down, including a charismatic overweight pilot whose jowls ripple as his damaged plane plunges toward the ocean. Our fearless Navy pilot is not phased by all this death around him--he has seen this before. He listens to Brooks & Dunn as he flies his old Corsair towards the alien-Taliban mothership. ""Dakota"" sits on his lap. As the Corsair makes its way toward the alien-Taliban mothership, a likeable black man, who in times of peace lives in a white neighborhood and drives a Ford Taurus, flies a fighter jet next to the Corsair radioing trite contrivances such as ""you da man"" to our Navy alcoholic pilot. The navy pilot lands his corsair inside the deck of the alien-Taliban mothership and finds the supreme evil alien-Taliban leader seated on a throne manufactured in mainland China. The throne is made out of discarded UAW membership cards and tainted baby formula that has been hardened from the heat emanating from a burning pile of Springsteen CDs. This evil-Taliban-alien leader has four arms and a black mustache made out of shredded voting ballots and ground-up White House pets. The menacing Taliban-alien-leader smiles as he snacks on a bowl of children who were denied after-school prayer. Prior to the impending battle the navy pilot takes out a heart-shaped locket with a photo of his estranged daughter who was tragically killed while trying to gain entry into Princeton. He gazes at the photo for way too long and says ""this one's for you babe"". He wipes a tear from his eye, clenches his fist anew, and then with dramatic urgency, swallows the locket, washing it down with a Diet Coke. [During this scene, a maudlin rock-ballad plays. It is being sung by a super-group formed especially for this movie; the super-group consists of Elton John, Steven Tyler and Derek Jeter.] The song ends and the navy pilot becomes full of rage and stares at the evil-Taliban-alien-leader. The Taliban-alien smiles and his skin turns even more brown, signifying a disdain for the nuclear family and baseball. The Reagan-loving Navy pilot strips down to his stars-and-bars boxer shorts, cursing under his breath. Bits and pieces from the high school basketball coach's rallying speech echo in his head. He says the pledge of allegiance backwards and then takes a pull of Jim Beam from a silver flask that hangs around Dakota's neck. He rushes the evil-Taliban-alien leader. There is a prolonged scene of near-homoerotic grappling and intense fighting in which we are occasionally led to believe that our Navy pilot is in peril. Eventually the navy pilot is able to shove a stack of mailorder catalogs and discarded plastic water bottles down the Alien-Taliban leader's throat. Our one-legged navy boy screams ""go to hell freedom-hater"" as he stomps on the head of the alien-Taliban leader.

In my opinion, December 21, 2012 will be here and it'll be a normal day.  Then we'll roll into December 22nd and everything will STILL be okay.  In my opinion, our world will end soon... just not in this generation and/or lifetime.  But, I digress.

Putting the science and theories aside, this movie is superbly entertaining.  There isn't much to the story, basically the story of multiple people--including an author and his family, a newly-appointed Geologist, and leaders of government--as they brace for the impending disaster.  What follows is an edge-of-your-seat thrill ride with a surprising amount of good ideas.  As the disaster is happening, the author must help guide his family to safety.  There, friendships are made and then broken, trust is betrayed, and hearts are put to the test.  However, the movie has one strong underlying theme--that is, the theme of hope and perseverance, no matter the struggle.

However, the movie suffers in one common way between all of these disaster movies:  Once the epic, in-the-previews disaster moments happen, the movies does its best to stall... instead, it goes in circles for a little bit, but once it picks up again the circling stops.

Oh, one more thing, is it just me or does John Cusack wear the same sunglasses in every movie?

Anyway, if you're not too sure about this movie or you're just in the mood for some mindless action, 2012 is the way to go.  At least rent it or borrow from a friend first--then, if you're like me and loved it, get it on Blu-ray.  Your HDTV will thank you.",1300579200,,1695,4.710884353741497

3734139,1,B001OQCV2E,"I finally got around to watching this stinker, and yes it is a stinker. The special effects are excellent but that's it for the compliments.

The script is bad, the dialogue banal, the acting talent wasted. The only point of this movie is to watch the special effects devastation. In between that devastation are some of the most boring or ridiculous scenes in all of moviedom.

Others have explained the problems with this movie in far greater detail than I am willing to exert, but I will explain my biggest complaint. They went to great expense to make the catastrophe scenes visually realistic, which certainly could have been interesting. But at the same time they are doing that, they are unloading some of the stupidest action sequences. While you watch the realistic earthquake scenes and are almost being pulled into the movie, they jerk you right back out, for example, by having a motor home jump a crater. The sheer stupidity of the action scenes takes away any pretense of realism.

And one observation- massive earth movements do not and cannot all result in huge yawning fissures in the earth. Some are going to simply move the earth horizontally with no fissures and others are going to result in elevations in the earth (have these folks heard of mountains?) But every time they want to put someone in danger, here comes another fissure. That got old.

3734140,2,B001OQCV2E,"As a person who loves disaster flicks I was so looking forward to seeing this latest entry from director Roland Emmerich (especially since I already have most of his films in my collection).  I'm sorry to say I didn't add this one to it.

I don't know that anything could have saved this glorious mess of mayhem.  Recasting?  A better script?  Cut the length?  Judicious editing?  I knew I was in for a bumpy ride right from the start, all those nonsensical snippets, itty bitty scenes that didn't add up to anything.  It took a half hour before someone bothered mentioning that ""the earth's crust was destabilizing.""  Even then, what exactly did that mean and why was there no sense of heightened urgency about it?  (This is what put the ho-hum in hokum.)  They kept flashing the years gone by before anything was actually done about it, it being the science mumbo jumbo barely mentioned at the start.  Wow.  This was one cold, aloof, action film; when it wasn't straying into outlandish comedy courtesy of Woody Harrelson & John Cusack.  Half of the cast was taking everything deadly serious, the other half either looked lost or were going off on their own, it didn't matter what this picture was about because it soon felt like a free-for-all.  Not because it stopped making sense but because it never really started.  Example: if the whole idea was to preserve humanity and what animals you could, would you start with saving all the old folks beyond procreation and leave the young behind?  Worse.  They had years to come up with this plan and that's the best they could do?  After about the second hour I was beginning to think a better plan would be just to let everything go to ruin and call it a day.
I don't even want to talk about Oliver Platt (normally one of my favorite actors).  Or the lounge act that sings ""It Ain't The End Of The World.""  I'm still trying to decide if that was meant to be ironic or inadvertently stupid.

3734142,3,B001OQCV2E,"I just finished the 2012 movie by watching it on Netflix. When i saw the trailer over a year ago i got really intrigued by the scene where the water pours over the mountain and the Asian religious man is swept away as he rings a bell. As i saw more of the scenes I thought it might be worth watching just for the special effects.

Well the special effects sometimes were over the top as I suppose was the concept for this movie. I DO NOT believe the world will end this way, so this was purely an excercise in fantasy as I watched Roland Emmerich direct his view of the Apocalypse.

The cast was well arranged as the main character's role was aptly filled by John Cusack who is usually loved in every role. Even the small part carried by Woody Harrelson was entertaining as he was so believable as a conspiracy shouting radio jock who is met by ""Jackson"" in Yellowstone National park.

Perhaps the most troubling scene for me was when the earth's axis was supposedly rearranged ny 28 degrees and the guy who assumes command after the president is out of the picture says you mean the north pole is now in Minnesota? Another guy says, ""That is the SOuth pole."" Sorry guys, but the shift would have to be much more than 28 degrees to realign the poles!

3734160,5,B001OQCV2E,"Unlike most of my friends, I adore a good disaster movie and this one was a corker.

The CGI effects are spectacular.  Better than any I've seen so far.  I've often wondered what would happen if and when the hot spot under Yellowstone National Park decided to go ballistic, and this movie gave me the opportunity of seeing it happen from the safety of my living room!  (Now someone just has to recreate the effect of the hot spot under the Bay of Naples--which includes the surroundings of the that city and Vesuvius--which is also an event waiting to happen!)

One does, however, have to suspend disbelief with considerable force if you have even a rudimentary knowledge of geology, cosmology, ecology or physics.  I doubt, for instance, that with the speed of a nu ardant the size that the Yellowstone mega volcano would probably produce would give anyone, even those within hundreds of miles of its immediate range, a chance to get away from it even in an airplane.  I find it difficult also to believe that the crust would be able to move quite that far or that quickly, though the end of Hawaii was certainly within the realm of possibility.  Nor given wave physics can I see a 24,000 foot tsunami topping the Himalayas.  I'm also baffled by how a ship might make it down from the Himalayas to sea level, though I think we are meant to infer that the Himalayas actually sank to sea level.  Though I think they ""got it right"" with respect to the numbers of humans needed to viably repopulate the earth after the disaster, I suspect the number of animals and the types of animal they saved was probably more viable in a Biblical rather than a scientific account of replacement.  Still, all this aside, it was a whopper of a spectacle.

I did have trouble with the touching scene involving the decision to rescue the ""ordinary"" folks who were being left behind out of a sense of ""humanity,"" esepcially since these same upright folks had already condemned the other 6 billion of us to oblivion by withholding information that might have allowed us to make provisions for our own survival--like they say, though, knowledge is power.  There are, however, poignant last goodbyes aplenty, many scenes when a truly decent sort dies while a ""bad"" sort lives, times when even a ""bad"" sort lives up to a higher code, and the heartfelt moment when a little dog is nearly left behind but manages to make it just in time. Anyone who has seen the Poseidon Adventure, Towering Inferno, Earthquake, Independence Day, the Day After Tomorrow and other similar films will recognize the format. Interestingly this type of film seems to come out in quantity during hard economic times.  I wonder what that says about our national psyche.

My favorite character was the outrageous conspiracy-theorist/radio host played by Woody Harrelson.  Anyone who willingly watches as a nu ardant approaches him is supremely out of touch with reality!

The plot is pretty weak but what the heck - that's not why I went to see this movie and I bet a lot of others agree with me.  The plot is alright; not terrible.

SPOILER WARNING:
One of my few problems that I had with ""2012"" is one I've seen mentioned in other reviews - only the powerful and/or rich were being allowed onto the Arks for saving.  A very sad commentary on our future world in case of disaster, I must say.

All of that said, there is one facet of this movie that I find to be rather fascinating.  We live in a solar system that is, for the most part, ultra-hostile to life as we know it.  To be sure, it is possible that there is microbial life beneath the icy sheath of Europa & perhaps there is microbial life on Titan ~ I get that.  However, for the post part, this cosmic backwater in the middle of Orion's Arm has little tolerance for sentient life that is advanced enough to build cities, write poetry & vote for a straight Democratic ticket.

The exception, of course, is what Carl Sagan eloquently referred to as a pale blue dot:  planet Earth.  It is here & only here that we find a celestial bastion that is overflowing with life.  The question the present movie poses, then, is this:  WHAT IF our beloved but fragile Earth began to resemble the other planets in our solar system?  It's a sobering question & it's certainly not a good thing for the human race.

Beyond that, other than some eye-candy special effects, I found this film to be rather bland.  You can only have a plane take off on a runway that is crumbling so many times before it starts to get old.  The sequence in the limo was fun, but entirely unbelievable.

I've always enjoyed movies with John Cusack & Amanda Peet.  They have a great chemistry together and they're both fine Thespians in their own rights.  For that reason alone, this flick is worth seeing.  Unfortunately, I found the ending to be a cop-out and pretty much a 21st rendition of the story of Noah's Ark.

In the not-so-grand tradition of ""When Worlds Collide,"" ""Earthquake,"" ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" ""Armageddon,"" ""Deep Impact,"" ""The Core,"" etc., ""2012"" is a big-budget disaster picture with a low-budget mentality.  Just how foolish it will look in 2013 is anyone`s guess - though it couldn't possibly look any more foolish than it did when it was released in 2009.  And all courtesy of that Grand Poobah of disaster flicks, Roland Emmerich.

The doomsday scenario in this instance comes in the form of exploding solar radiation that has become so intense that it's begun to cause the Earth's core to melt (like a microwave oven, we`re told), resulting in the wholesale destruction of the planet's crust.  This obviously doesn't bode well for the people dwelling on the surface, where life as we know it will soon cease to exist - just as the Mayans so cannily predicted centuries ago.

As with any disaster-movie worthy of the title, the story involves little more than an assortment of stock characters trying to keep one step ahead of the impending apocalypse.  This particular cross-section of humanity includes John Cusack as a writer of prescient but less-than-commercially-successful sci-fi novels, Amanda Peet as his ex-wife, Danny Glover as the President of the United States, Thandie Newton as the President's daughter, Oliver Platt as his self-interested Chief of Staff, Chiwetel Ejiofor as a brilliant geologist, and, for comic relief purposes, Woody Harrelson as a bug-eyed, trailer-dwelling, crackpot conspiracy theorist whose theoretic conspiracies turn out to be anything but crackpot.

And because of the enormous and far-reaching nature of the disaster, the movie can borrow bits from any number of previous disaster movies and get away with it; thus, we get a touch of ""The Day After Tomorrow"" here, a smidgen of ""The Poseidon Adventure"" there.  Heck, there's even a hint of ""Wall-E"" in the closing moments.

There's always an odd and uncomfortable moral principle operating in films of this type: namely, who cares if the whole world is going to hell in a hand basket, so long as our intrepid band of survivors (usually including an adorable pet or two) makes its way to safety.  And the trite and corny estranged-spouse melodrama involving Cusack and Peet that Emmerich and co-writer Harald Klasser have seen fit to plaster onto their vision of a worldwide holocaust is enough to make us start rooting for humanity's wholesale annihilation long before the movie's hit the halfway mark.  Apparently, in contradiction to what Rick said at the end of ""Casablanca,"" the problems of a couple of little people DO amount to a hill of beans, after all - at least in the eyes of Hollywood.

Of course, one doesn't go to these types of films in search of grand themes or complex characterizations, but rather for the epic and wanton destruction of all things animate and inanimate - and in that respect, at least, ""2012"" delivers the goods.  In fact, the action and special effects are so preposterous and over-the-top that one can't help but admire the sheer, unadulterated, childlike trashiness of it all.

So hunker on down to watch humanity get the [...]-kicking of a lifetime - just make sure to have plenty of popcorn and Jujubes on hand to help get you through the experience.",1294358400,,3298,5.0256880733944955
3734166,4,B001OQCV2E,"Director Roland Emmerich's supposed final disaster movie, 2012, follows the mythical belief that the Mayan's predicted that the world will end on December 21, 2012.

Before we get to the film, it should be noted that the Mayan's did not believe the end of the world would happen on this date at all. The fear/prediction came from freaked out Westerners.

2012 stars John Cusack as author Jackson Curtis (get this, he is named after 50 Cent whose real name is Curtis Jackson). Jackson and his wife, Kate (Amanda Peet) are divorced with two kids.

Jackson takes their kids on a camping trip to Yellowstone National Park.

Meanwhile, back in 2009, scientist Adrien Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) informs the President (Danny Glover) of the impending doom. This gives the nations of the world 3 years to build ships to survive the coming end of the world.

Jackson and his family flee the destruction of California, and hitch a ride with a Russian billionaire and his sons.

Flash to scenes with the President and the destruction, flash to another story about two old men on a cruise ship, flash back to Jackson and his family.

This is Emmerich's way of giving us an intimate/emotional connection amongst the global end.

Jackson learns that the leaders of the countries have been building Arks in the mountains of China, so it's a race to the big boats before the big waves crash into them.

The moral of this movie is: if you want to survive the end of the world you need to have 1 Billion Euros or be closely attached to the leader of a country. Everyone else is doomed. So sorry. And it's not even the end of the world; the planet survives. I was hoping to see ultimate extinction ala Vulcan on the new Star Trek movie.

2012 is a heart-racing thriller. It's a fun, popcorn flick. Don't expect any Oscars though. While it's global destruction is on a new level, I found the special effects to be lacking. When an aircraft carrier tumbles into the White House, you can totally tell it's a miniature.",1294099200,,1996,4.644886363636363
3734167,5,B001OQCV2E,"Look, there's absolutely *no* logical reason to watch 2012 because of the storyline- this film is entirely about dazzling viewers with current Hollywood technology.  Obviously it makes zero sense that a man and his family would somehow be able to swerve around *every single obstacle* throughout the dangerous streets of Los Angeles including falling buildings and collapsing roads, and obviously it's impossible to believe an airplane would be able to get off the ground literally seconds before the runway collapses into dust and lava, thereby saving all the main characters from instant disaster.

Obviously the storyline is completely predictable and contrived because it centers around a typical father attempting to save his ex-wife and kids from a series of earthquakes taking place around North America.  Yes that's right- EX-wife.  This means there's two fathers in the storyline, and of course, the wife and ex-husband occasionally fight.  You already knew that though, because I said ""ex-wife"".  Yes this is basically the most predictable film ever and perfectly ripe and ready for insults except...

caring about the special effects above everything else is *definitely* the way to approach it.  It's just a shame the final 45 minutes of film were pretty disappointing involving a mediocre underwater adventure.  You don't go from earthquakes and volcanoes to... being trapped in water for an unnecessarily long period of time.

Emmerich started his homage to the subgenre with Independence Day, developed it into a fine stew with Day After Tomorrow and puts it completely over the top with 2012.  In this film, he intentionally pushes the genre completely over the edge and I don't see how he can make another disaster movie after this unless he tries to completely reinvent the form.

As I watched the film, I kept thinking back to Earthquake, The Posiden Adventure, Twister and any number of other films that he winked at on the way past.  He has taken some of these special effect concepts and tweaked them to the point where all you can do is laugh.  They are completely dazzling, but also so far over the top that he is actually making a comment on the very nature of disaster movies while dazzling.

As if to punctuate that point, he has terrific actors in cardboard roles.  If Charlton Heston made you laugh in Earthquake, John Cusack and Woody Harrelson will absolutely crack you up in this film.  It is so absurd that all you can do is laugh.

It's not exactly a put on, but Emmerich's tongue is very deeply in his cheek.  I laughed all the way through the movie.",1293408000,,1214,4.4772727272727275
3734169,4,B001OQCV2E,"Background:

The title of this film was based on the predictions of the Mayan Calendar. This calendar predicts that that cataclysmic or transformative events will occur in the year 2012 culminating on the winter solstice December 21, 2012. It is important to note that this conclusion is based on subjective interpretations. These interpretations are broadly based on a mixture of archaeoastronomical speculation, mythology, and numerological constructions. Additionally, it is believed that the Mayans may have had the help of extraterrestrial beings.

On the other hand, the Holy Bible in the Book of Revelation does outline the end of this age as well in what is known as the apocalypse. The primary difference in these schools of thought is that, the Mayans believed that the earth goes through a recycling process approximately every 5,125 solar years, while the Bible teaches that the apocalypse is really a period of judgment and purification, after which the earth will then go into what is known as the Millenniun Reign of Christ.

Based on the writings of the Bible, you can be pretty sure that the world will NOT end in the year 2012.

Plot/Storyline:

The story starts in India, in the year 2009, Dr. Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor), an American geologist, visits astrophysicist Dr. Satnam Tsurutani (Jimi Mistry). What is discovered is that neutrinos from a massive solar flare are causing the temperature of the Earth's core to increase. This in turn will lead to the the earth becoming unstable.

As a result, in 2010 a secret project intended to ensure humanity's survival is initiated. This project involves the construction of massive ships at Cho Ming, Tibet, in the Himalayas. These ships will have the capacity to hold about 400,000 people (mostly politicians and the very wealthy)

Now in the year 2012, we meet Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), a science fiction writer in Los Angeles who works part-time as a limousine driver for billionaire Yuri Karpov (Zlatko Buri). Using the limo, he takes his two children on a camping trip at Yellowstone National Park, it is here that he discovers that all is not well and that major catastrophes are no the way.

Cinematics:

This film is a cinematic wonder. Presented are a series of massive cataclysmic events that include entire cities. If you hook up a sub-woofer to your DVD player you will be able to capture all the spectacular rumbling noise that goes with these earthquakes.

What raises the tension in this film is the many instances where Curtis barely escapes with his family. On several occasions he is just feet away from the collapsing surface of the earth. Some of these scenes will have you holding onto your seat. The excitement in this film is EXTREME!

Conclusion:

This is a film that shows how fragile life as we know it really is, and how there is really a very delicate balance in place that keeps our daily lives going. While I do not believe that anything major will happen in 2012, there is still something up ahead in the not too distant future.",1293321600,,3037,4.91015625

A family tries to survive, ... well everything in this one.  However some past flicks like 'earthquake' which should be on blu ray didn't have all the main characters survive and used model work instead of cgi which in this case looks awesome. This is just a fast flick with lots of action so I can't complain, it's not about a real disaster. Hello, the Mayans thought they'd still be around in 2012, so take the calender end of the world thing with a grain of salt.

3734196,3,B001OQCV2E,"Roland Emmerich isn't exactly what you would call a ""deep"" filmmaker.

By that, I mean to infer that his films do not necessarily challenge their viewers to ponder anything meaningful or everlasting. Emmerich's attempts, more often than not, are of the popcorn variety. And ""2012,"" his latest, is definitely no exception.

In it, John Cusack struggles amidst a cast of thousands to save his family as the world faces its ultimate cataclysmic destruction during the very year allegedly foretold by the mayans.

That's really all that needs to be said. Anyone familiar enough with this director's repetoire should already be fully aware that eye-candy is all his overblown spectacles are about.

3734199,3,B001OQCV2E,"So you say you like disaster movies. Well, boy do I have a movie for your that is the mother of all disasters.

That's not to say 2012 is a bad movie. It's actually a reasonable entertaining movie. Long on special effects, but unfortunately, long on hokieness too (If that even is a word). And long in time at 2 hours and 38 minutes, which was about one hour too long, give or take a disaster or two. 2012 is just one disaster after another until your left at movie's end gasping for breath and hoping there's actually some air in our world left to breathe.

2012, which was directed by Roland Emmerich like he was directing a pinball machine, is corny and contrived. A ""B"" movie disguised as an ""A"" movie extravaganza. It's melodramatic in a funny sort of way. Predictable, but somewhat enjoyable, if you don't mind the stilted dialogue and less than believable secondary plot lines. If it had been produced as a ""B"" movie with less famous actors, this movie might have become somewhat of a bright spot.

2012 sadly short on even the slightest bit of suspense as to what will happen next. I actually sat back and said what was going to occur in the next minute of the movie, even to the point where I knew the mistress of the big, bad Russian billionaire would shoot him the middle finger as she sneaked onto the survival ark (yes, there's actually 3 survival arks) while he was stranded outside.

The movie starts in 2009, when Scientist Dr. Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) travels to India to discover from fellow scientists that the earth's core temperature is increasing rapidly, He rushes back to America, and at a fund raiser, he accosts White House Chief of Staff Carl Anheuser, played brilliantly by the always reliable Oliver Platt, and hands him papers that basically say the world as we know it is going to end, most likely in 2012, because that's when some ancient Mayan calendar says it is going to end; December 21, 2012, to be precise. Anahauser informs the President of the United States Thomas Wilson (Danny Clover, who plays the entire movie with a look of shock and disbelief on his face. Morgan Freeman was much better) of the dire circumstances. By 2010, The United States and the leaders of 46 countries start a massive, secret project to build several ""arks"" to insure the survival of the human race.

They decide that only 400,000 people will be able to fit on these arks, that are being built at Cho Ming, Tibet in the Himalayas. In order to fund these arks, without tipping off the normal citizens of the world, they decided to sell these seats for one billion euros per seat. So guess who's going to survive the oncoming catastrophe. Not people like you or me of course, but only the leaders of the world, their staffs, scientists involved in the project, and thousands of billionaire bags-of-wind from dozens of countries.

Enter Jackson Curtis (John Cusak) in 2012, a Science Fiction novelist who wrote a book only 500 copies of which were sold, one of whom, amazing to Dr Helmsley, who carries the book around with him like a pet rock.. Talk about non-believability. Curtis is so unsuccessful as a writer, he presently drives a limo for a Russian billionaire Russian (Zlatko Buric), who unbeknownst to Curtis, has bought several seats on the ark, for himself, his annoying two brat sons, his pilot (Johann Urb), and his girlfriend Tamara (Beatrice Rosen), who is secretly banging his pilot. For animal lovers, Tamara is constantly clutching a tiny dog in her arms, which leads to the predictable ""oh please save the little dog from destruction"" scene. (Insert cheers here)

Curtis is divorced and his ex-wife Kate (Amada Peet) is currently living with her boyfriend Gordon (Thomas McCarthy), who is a plastic surgeon (amazingly he did Tamara's boob job) and an amateur pilot, which comes in handy real soon. Also Curtis two kids are living with Kate and Gordon, Noah who is somewhat of a brat, and Lily, who still wets her pants at night and has a fixation with wearing hats, any kind of hats.

Curtis arrives, hate of course, to take his kids on a camping trip to Yellowstone Park, where they meet Charlie Frost (Woody Harrelson), a freaked out hippie who's doing a daily radio show that predicts the end of the world. He tells Curtis about a Mesoamerican Long Count Calender that says we are all finito on December 21, 2012. At first Curtis thinks Charlie is a little bats in the belfry, but changes his mind after Charlie shows him blueprints for the ark, and pictures of government officials from around the world who were murdered because they found out about the end of the world and the ark, and were about to alert the rest of us peons.

Curtis rushes home with the kids and tried to tell Kate and Gordon abut the impending disaster. Before they can tell Curtis how crazy he is, the house begins to crumble and everyone rushed out to Curtis car. Thus begins a crazy car chase, where Curtis' car is being chased by the city of Pasadena crumbling behind them. They rush to a small private plane that Curtis had just rented and Gorden very shakily engineers the takeoff. Then they bob and weave through falling building and bridges to safely. But not for long.

This is the start of one disaster after another. Too numerous to innumerate. Cities crumble like dust and tidal waves destroy national landmarks. The coolest one is where a tsunami destroys Washington DC, and the aircraft carrier The John F. Kennedy, carried on the waves, personally takes out the White House. (Too bad it wasn't occupied by today's residents.)

Obviously 2012 is not Academy Award material. But it does take you on a wild ride, which is quite enjoyable, if you don't care too much that the plot is full of so many holes, it doesn't hold water as a top flight movie.

I'll give 2012 two and a half stars out of a possible five stars. Only because the special effects are a doozy to watch.",1290124800,,5906,4.635755258126195

3734201,5,B001OQCV2E,"2012 is THE Greatest Disaster Movie yet made and I think it will never be topped. This fantastic movie has everything: Earthquakes, sinking ships, volcanic eruptions, car crashes, capsizing ships, tidal waves, collapsing buildings - EVERYTHING!! (except killer bees --- and ""The Swarm"" was pretty lame.) All the best disasters rolled into one wonderful and fun ride. The only sad thing about the DVD is that 2012 was truly a big screen movie. To be in the theater and see all the detail as buildings tumble, people run screaming this way and that, explosions all about the screen, and especially the awesome sound as windows shatter and the earthquake rumbles in your chest. WOW! If you have a home theater perhaps you can capture that same awesome feeling.

Many viewers and critics complain about the plot, which I think is silly. You don't go to a disaster movie expecting Academy Award drama, just like you don't expect that in any number of genres: Horror and Action for example. And though I did find the plot a bit goofy at times, I found the characters extrememly likeable and often very realistic. John Cusack was great as a normal joe, a loser to be blunt, trying to save his family. Amanda Peet was a good mom. Woody Harrelson was superb as a crazy conspiracy theorist who knew the disaster was coming. Dannie Glover was a good president.  Chiwetel Ejiofor and Oliver Platt were wonderful as a Good Cop and Bad Cop for the Feds, arguing about who to save, what to save, cover ups, and all kinds of cool stuff. And my absolute favorite was young Morgan Lily, Cusack's and Peet's daughter, a very observant young girl.

The special effects are the main treat but I thought 2012 also touched on some wonderful thought provoking ideas such as what do you save when all of civilization is in peril? Whom do you save?

Another fun thing is some great GREAT lines. When faced with the thought of desperate measures and sacrifices made to save a portion of mankind, Platt says ""What did you think? We're all just gonna get onboard, hold hands and sing ""Kumbaya""? Sit down and buckle up.""
-When fleeing The Largest Explosion Ever Put To Film, Cusack tries to comfort his daughter. ""Do I look scared?"" She nods ""Uh-huh!""
-Then, near the climax, Platt again: ""Something went wrong? SOMETHING WRONG? Are you kidding me? Of course something went wrong!!!""
-Ah me, great writing.

3734212,1,B001OQCV2E,"Most of the 5 star reviews seem to be based on the premise ""yes its awful, but look at the special effects"". Well special effects can be good, bad or great, depending on how big a wall of money is thrown at them. In fact, if I were an atheist, I could find a convincing argument for the non existence of God in the fact that Emmerich manages to find the finance to hang his ridiculous films around such fantastic special effects. So lets look at this without the special effects and see whats left... Basically, plots and scripts so inane that they would probably have embarrassed the editors of the He-Man and the Masters of the Universe cartoon series.

After discovering the impending disaster, the governments of the world needed to raise money from private individuals at 1bn Euros... yes Euros, per ticket to safety. The end of the world, even if its being kept a secret, rather begs the question of why the world economy would need to continue to function normally. Its not like storing up inflation in the system is going to be an issue. Meanwhile, out among the ordinary people, a loving divorced Dad rescues his cute kids and their Mom from the collapse of California into the sea with some nifty stunt driving, then manages to keep ahead of the pyroclastic flow from the exploding Yellowstone caldera with the same trick. I thought a pyroclastic flow moved at the speed of sound but I guess not. Mom's new boyfriend finally has the decency to get killed, thus avoiding any social awkwardness, (believe me, I'm not giving much away here) after flying the family to China. The family then re-unites, thus proving that there is no such thing as divorce... or something. Then we have the senior surviving member of the Whitehouse staff making dumb and inhumane decisions with no logical rationale other than to give the hero something to react against and prove his humanity with insufferable pomposity. In the background of one scene, Queen Elizabeth trots along to safety with her corgis, just to give the American contingent something to shake their heads over, without apparently giving any of them pause to wonder by what right they are on the liferaft. I'm middle of the road on the monarchy, but I do think its fair to say that, of any world leader, in the circumstances portrayed, she would be one of those most likely to stay with her people.

The point is, this isn't in the tradition of dumb but fun big budget sci-fi, like 'When Worlds Collide' or even, 'The Core'. This wears a big suit of lights saying, 'look at my compassion and humanity' and like most who do, it is devoid of either humanity, compassion, humour or soul.",1289520000,10,2644,4.647435897435898
3734213,2,B001OQCV2E,"This is no award-winning movie, with strengths in acting or story or the like.  It's essentially the latest ""stuff blowing up"" movie by Roland Emmerich, who makes these movies regularly, for money.

However, something about this movie makes it stand out particularly dreadfully from most others of the same genre.  The introductory sequence of LA breaking apart is full of shots of people in cars as their cars are destroyed, people being killed as stuff knocks them around, and shots of huge skyscrapers crumbling and tumbling, and quick shots of people inside the wreckage, clinging to things helplessly.

It's almost impossible for me to watch.  It's too traumatizing, too sickening, and cannot be properly tempered by the fact that it's all just CGI fiction.  The fact is, the shots of people bear a far too striking resemblence to the scenes from September 11th 2001, where we saw people jumping out of the towers to their inevitable deaths.

But enough of that.  On the brighter side, as I've noticed with ""10,000 BC"", Roland Emmerich is very good with broader storylines, and very bad with smaller storylines involving individual people.  The concept of the Arks and everything after the initial ""stuff blowing up"" parts are decent enough, but the individual characters are one-dimensional archetypes you've seen in pretty much all his movies and others.

Oliver Platt's character is the stereotypical ""bad guy"" because he's the voice of reason, taken to the extreme of cold logic and rationality at the expense of human lives---the Superego.  He justifies the fact that the majority of those being saved in the Arks are the very rich, because without their money supporting it, the project would never have gotten started.  There's Chiwetel Ejiofor's character, the opposite of him, the Id, who mopes constantly and contradicts the ""bad guy"" with emotion and humanity.  There's the bumbling fat foreign guy and his trophy wife, whom he betrays and leaves for dead, only to be betrayed in turn by her later on.  There's the dorky science guy, played in the exact same vein as Dr. Phlox from Star Trek Enterprise (obviously it's the same actor) by John Billingsley

Amazingly (for a movie like this) there are inklings of contradictions in some characters---tendencies for them to act outside of their archetypes, but these are few and far between.  Speaking of which, plenty of dialogue is stupid and cliche'd, like ""who would have thought the crazies with the cardboard signs would be right?"" and the scenes not involving the Arks or the ""stuff blowing up"" is largely boring and filler.

Amazingly again, just a few superficial changes, particularly involving characterization, would have made this movie uniquely different from others of the same genre, and probably worth 3 or 4 stars out of 5.  But it's not, and it doesn't.",1288742400,2,2835,5.034261241970022
3734214,5,B001OQCV2E,"Look, this movie has so many flaws that it's really difficult on where to begin but it also has some amazing pros to it.

PROS
- visually pretty (and I mean some fantastic special effects people worked on this and pulled out all the stops, well not like Avatar but the effects were neat)
- it's a global catastrophe movie

CONS
- nobody explains how the Maya knew - although that's not explored much at all
- the special effects are unrealistic (I mean do we really have a to fly a plane under a falling train?)...then again, it's an end of the world movie so why not go all out ... which they do
- the action scenes just keep coming and coming and coming and going and going and going. . . it's neverending
- seriously, the politicians and the rich is who we decide to save?
- how did they know that the means for survival should be put where it was put and that it would work as designed....I mean, entire continents were swallowed in lava...
- the characters do things that normal people wouldn't do
- the plot has many many MANY MANY many many issues and holes in it
- it has a happy ending (after a global calamity of giganormous proportions, everything is just fine in about a month....go figure and they head off to the one place on earth that wasn't impacted by the calamity . . . huh?  why spend billions building your rescue vehicle if there were parts of earth that were hardly affected?  Just save the money and go to that place right?)

So at the end of the day, if you have absolutely nothing else going on then consider sitting down and suspending disbelief....and you have to work hard at suspending disbelief.

This movie probably works best as a drinking game:
- everytime an entire city crumbles, take a drink
- everytime lava is shown, take a drink
- everytime a giant tsunami hits, take  a drink
- everytime something just plain ridiculouse happens, take a drink
- anytime there is a plot lapse, take a drink
- anytime an actor does something that no rational human being would ever do, take a drink

You'll be roaring drunk in 5 minutes and probably suffer from alcohol poisoning by about minut 15 after the action gets going.  No on second thought, forget the drinking game -- too dangerous in this kind of movie.

I gave it 5 stars because it is definitely an A movie, with an A cast....and, it was FUN to watch.",1288742400,,2336,4.349425287356322

3734216,1,B001OQCV2E,"This movie is basically a bunch of CGI catastrophic disaster sequences with just enough of a story wrapped around it to commercially release it as a film. The director seems to have wanted to do a modern noah's ark story. But rather than anything biblical, we get Mayan prophecy, a pseudoscience driven collapse of the earth's crust and arks built by the rich/powerful for themselves.

The film features bad acting, unlikeable characters and a plot that only serves as filler between CGI disaster sequences. Oh. And if the world ever looks like its going to end, just head for Africa. Even Mayan prophecy doesn't apply to Africa.",1288051200,8,629,4.878504672897196
3734217,5,B001OQCV2E,"Usually I have major problems with disaster movies because the characters and plot get lost in all the action packed special effects. Even most of the acting takes a backseat but with 2012 it's a little different. At times it can be very silly and over the top but to be honest this movie was so intense I didn't pay attention to the faults of this film. I just didn't care. 2012 honestly kept me on the edge of my seat most of the way through and let me tell you the special effects were mind blowing! Absolutely remarkable! It's worth watching just for the visuals alone, seriously. This is the real purpose of CGI. Everything nowadays is too much CGI and it's ruining films in my opinion because it's over-used in films that don't need it. For something like this that goes beyond anyone's imagination is just perfect and done correctly. Critics will find a lot of things wrong with this movie because it's not perfect, nor is any movie but this is just pure entertainment at its best. It's intense, sad, and quite sickening how selfish some people can be when the world has turned into complete chaos.

3734218,4,B001OQCV2E,I found this movie to be quite good even if I don't particularly like disaster movies. The acting was was well done and the special effects were really good.  If you have a home theater with surround sound it is highly recommended that you buy this in the Blue Ray format.  The plot is simple - The earth is undergoing a metamorphesus and only a select few will be allowed to survive.  Not because the govenment is cruel but because there just wasn't enough lead time to allow for more people to escape the disaster without a wide spread panic.  They select the smartest richest and most influential in the world to ride out the storm and become the Adams and Eves of the new world.,1287619200,,682,4.388888888888889
3734219,4,B001OQCV2E,"The movie's premise: As predicted by the prophecies of an apocalyptic end in the Mayan calendar, Solar flares send neutrinos which chemically and physically alter the Earth's subterranean core, causing Earth Crust Displacement, a theory proposed by Professor Charles H. Hapgood in the 1950s.  The problem with this, however, is that it follows too closely to Lawrence E. Joseph's 2012 Apocalypse, with a hodge-podge collection of pseudo-sciences, real scientific theories, and multiple conspiracy theories.

The movie dabbles into realism here and there; however, it's mostly special effects.  Which in this case is AWESOME!

When limo driver Jackson Curtis (John Cusack) learns of the Earth's impending destruction - something predicted by Geologist Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) - he morphs into a stunt car driver, Houdini in vehicular transport, a man capable of evading the Earth's cataclysmic forces, be it earthquake, tidal wave, or volcano explosions by the skin of his teeth.  He scoops up his kids, ex-wife (Amanda Peet), her boyfriend Gordon (Thomas McCarthy), and after some helpful insight from a crackpot conspiracy theorist named Charlie (Woody Harrelson) living in Yellowstone National Park, begin their escape towards a secretive last chance for species continuity.  Luckily for them, Gordon is a novice pilot with the skills of a Blue Angel, and his connections to a Russian billionaire may help the group survive.

If the special effects are the lead role in this film, then the cast is clearly option 1A.  In addition to those already mentioned, the cast is rounded out by Dannie Glover, Thandie Newton, Oliver Platt, and Stephen McHattie.  They do a wonderful job despite having little to work with in the way of script.

In the end it's a little too much Day After Tomorrow with a Deep Impact finale and there is nearly no character development, but the FX carries the film like a giant boat on an apocalyptic wave.  Sure, it's almost completely implausible, some of the science is laughable at best, and the script is very minimal, but this is just one of those popcorn movies with which a grain of salt and an empty head are necessary.",1287273600,5,2164,5.119318181818182

But an underlying message that one can glean from it is that having faith in God won't help anyone (unless, the one you serve is the Dalai Lama) and that humanity itself, given the right scenario, will suddenly become loving and kind and good.  Humans are basically selfish - particularly when their self interest is at stake.  If what occurred in this movie happened in real life, the world would not be singing Kumba Yah at the end.  But, overall, it was an engaging story and a well done film, so I give it 3 stars.",1286582400,,654,4.371900826446281
3734232,3,B001OQCV2E,"One genre of movies that seems to keep growing every year is the disaster/apocalypse genre. I think this genre is so popular in Hollywood as well as with the public because this is where a lot of the summer blockbuster movies come in. Who doesn't like seeing stuff blown up or destroyed, right?! Disaster flicks usually have lots of special effects too (whether old school movie magic or new school cgi). And a lot of people currently seem to be obsessed with technology. I for one always start at the same place with a movie...THE STORY. Am I interested in the story? Does the story have a plot? Is the plot any good? And do the characters interest me? IF I can answer yes to at least one of these questions (if not all), THEN I get interested in seeing the movie. Of course the trailer is where you get a sneak peak and see if you can answer one of those questions.

2012 always seemed like a rip-off of Armageddon (1998) and Deep Impact (1998) to me since I first saw the trailer. Both of those movies were inspired by the year 2000 as it approached and the supposed end of the world with that year. And 2012 is out in preparation for the end of the world again in 2012 according to Mayan lore. The trailer did look interesting visually, so I decided to watch the movie recently since it came out on HBO or Starz (I can't remember which). I was pleasantly surprised that the movie was pretty good. I give it 3 out 5 stars. I felt it dragged on a little bit at 2-1/2 hours, but I kept getting pulled back into the story and the characters. Director Roland Emmerich is probably most famous for Independence Day (1996), also dipping its toes in the disaster genre, but from an alien/sci-fi perspective. And I think ID4 (as it is also known) is the better of the two movies. It has better actors...and I think aliens as the enemy instead of the calendar is a better premise. But I will say the cgi effects are good in 2012.",1286236800,,1922,4.32409972299169

I like that the last suspenseful moments are from our heroes screwing up, but I really didn't like losing the step-father in all this and am not at all sure that our main hero, Jackson, deserved winning his family back.

In Deep Impact & Armageddon, the world is going to end from a comet impact.  In the Day after Tomorrow it's Global Warming.  In ""2012"" it's a massive neutrino eruption from the Sun that heats the core and loosens the crust.  The triteness is thick for a while:  you got the intrepid geo-scientist from ""Tomorrow,"" the governmental conspiracy and Washington focus from ""Deep Impact,"" the cracks and tsunamis from ""Deep Impact,"" the world-wide scope from ""Independence Day,"" the super-hero Dad from ""Tomorrow,""  and the modern-day ""Noah's Ark"" from ""When World's Collide.""  All with some twists:  In 2012, it's the Chinese who make the arks (I guess the US is too refined to make any huge manufacturing products any more!) The first part of the movie is filled with lots of destruction and ridiculous escapes from massive earthquakes.  (Sure, if there's a huge earthquake, just get in your car and drive like a maniac!  THAT's how to escape it!)

The good part comes when we get to know the characters, and they're getting onto the massive arks, and there's some real drama when you wonder who is going to live and who is going to die.  It's still a bit melodramatic though.  The Black Geologist PhD (doesn't everyone know one?) saves the world, by overruling the entire chain-of-command on his ark (and getting all the good Euros to vote down the selfish Donald Rumsfeld type). Also the Super-Duper-Divorced-Dad wins his son's and ex-wife's affection back from the doomed Stepfather (don't you ever wonder why Divorced Dads are so often heros in Hollywood movies?  Probably a lot of directors are divorced!)

3734299,2,B001OQCV2E,"Here's another instance where everybody & their grandma's already chimed in on 2012, but the film ties in with many ideas relevant to my internet site, so...

The whole Maya calendar thing is more or less already imploding in on itself--since it wasn't ""real"" to begin with, so there's no point going into that. Suffice it to say that in the film there are pockets of people (mostly scientists, eccentrics & the mega-rich) who are in on the secret that Armageddon will be 21. December 2012. Apparently not even the US President (Danny Glover) knows until it's too late. So the movie is all about special effects (which I didn't feel were THAT spectacular--for the exception of the ocean scenes that had a sort of beauty all their own), and one implausible--impossible-- scene after another. 2012 stars John Cusack (an actor who usually projects a pleasnt personna), but, again, his numerous near escapes from death are so repetitious as to be ludicrous, and his character is lost in a very thin script that demands suspension of believability.

Only a Steven Speilberg could have saved this movie with all its cliches & poor attempts at audience manipulation; they even throw in a Dali Lama who actually bears a pretty good resemblance to the real one. Another strange example of this involves a character introduced early on. He is s sort of crazed hippy prophet of 2012. He befriends Cusack's character & so it is odd that he is allotted an ingominious end. He is standing on a mountaintop where he is supposedly chronicleling The End. He drops something, bends over to pick it up, with the crack of his ass prominently showing. Then he's pulverized along with the moutain.. I'm not sure if this was supposed to be funny, or it was some sort of commentary on the character. Whatever, it was just silly.

I'm usually a sucker for the sentimental, but I just couldn't bring myself to care about these people. They were trite & seemingly pulled from central casting. You start to get a glimmer of relationship towards the end, but it's too little, way too late.

2012 is rated PG & that's good because only kids--might--really enjoy it.",1281744000,3,2135,4.762162162162162

  In order to enjoy a disaster movie, it's important to suspend your disbelief to a large extent. Don't expect this type of movie to be at all logical, nor should you expect its characters to be very well developed. If the plot takes you from 'A' to 'B', with a reasonable amount of fast-paced action, then it probably has done its job.

  No, I did not think 2012 was a masterpiece; but with its great special effects, it certainly ranks as passable. 2012 deals with a rather unpleasant subject: the end of the world. The ancient Mayan prediction that the world will come to an end in 2012, comes true in this movie. Director Roland Emmerich purposely avoids hammering his audience with true tragedy. We never see any close-ups of mangled bodies or blood being shed. Everything is shot at a distance so that we get the 'bigger picture' of what it would be like when the world is destroyed; that way, the true horror and terror is minimized.

  The best scenes in 2012 focus on the journey of part-time novelist and limousine driver, Jackson Curtis, very ably played by John Cusack. His journey begins when he picks up his kids from his ex-wife, who is now living with a new boyfriend, Gordon, a plastic surgeon, and takes them on a vacation excursion to Yellowstone National Park. Curtis runs into the best character in the film, Charlies Frost, in one of Woody Harrelson's best roles in a long time. What's so wonderful about the crazed Frost, is that he's one of these guys who's been trying to warn the world about his apocalyptic world view for years and now everything he's been saying has been vindicated. Frost actually welcomes death and stands impassively as the volcano consumes him. He revels in his last 'moment in the sun'. Curtis, on the other hand, initially believes him to be a crackpot, especially after Frost claims he has a map with the location of a secret ark project, which the world leaders have been working on, anticipating the end of the world.

  Finally Curtis sees the light when he sees the news report about the seismic activity that splits a supermarket in half which his ex-wife and her boyfriend were just in. He wisely rents a small plane and then drives to LA where he picks up his ex-wife, the boyfriend and his two children and then drives to the airport as the city collapses around them. Yes, all the near misses are ridiculous, but the special effects will keep you riveted to your seat. After making it to the airport, there's a new surprise: the pilot is dead and Gordon must fly the plane, despite only having a few lessons as a student pilot. They fly to Yellowstone in order to get a hold of Charlie's map and just escape as a volcano explodes. The map points to China and Curtis realizes that they'll never get there in a Cessna.

  When they arrive in Las Vegas, a huge crack has already appeared in the airport runway. Curtis runs into his Russian billionaire boss, Yuri, who has paid for tickets on the Ark, and also happens to have a giant Antonov 500 aircraft, which takes them to China. Yuri is another colorful character, who ruthlessly ditches his girlfriend, Tamara, as he only has three tickets for himself and his two children on the Ark. But later, he redeems himself by saving his children by throwing them onto the Ark while the gates are closed and then falling to his death as a result.

  There's more exciting action when the Ark is unable to power up due to a jammed and malfunctioning boarding gate. At the last minute, as the effects of a tsunami pushes the Ark toward Mt. Everest (which has been displaced to a different location thousands of miles away due to a movement of the earth's crust), Curtis goes underwater inside the hydraulics chamber (and with the assistance of his son) removes an impact driver which has been preventing the Ark from powering up.

  As to be expected, despite all the great action scenes, 2012 falls down in the area of character development. Emmerich serves up a cornucopia of politically correct characters including three blacks who are virtually faultless. They are: Dr. Adrian Helmsely, the American geologist, who proves how righteous he is when he insists that the stranded passengers who couldn't board a damaged Ark be allowed on the one he's boarded (Helmsley notes that his assigned room can fit a lot more people). Pitted against him is the supposedly heartless, white Chief of Staff, Carl Annheuser (Oliver Platt), who argues realistically that allowing the extra passengers might jeopardize the entire project. Even worse is the saintly president, Thomas Wilson (Danny Glover), who decides to remain in Washington, and 'go down with the ship'. In contrast, Emmerich obnoxiously has Queen Elizabeth board the Ark with a couple of her Corgis, implying that she's a coward! Naturally the president's daughter, Laura Wilson, must overcome her grief by striking up a romance with Helmsley, as they head for their new destination in Africa.

  There's plenty of other cheesy stuff that relegates 2012 to the realm of the mediocre. There's a particularly distasteful line about how the gene pool will be compromised when two Arab sheiks are seen, en route to board one of the Arks. And what about how expendable Gordon, the ex-wife's boyfriend is. After he's killed, it takes a scant minute or so before the ex-wife is back in the arms of John Cusack (Curtis). Also note that that Tibetan Buddhist monks are noble but Chinese soldiers are heartless. Other disappointing characters and moments are well chronicled here on the internet. But 2012 sometimes gets it right: the last moment of the Indian astrophysicist and his family may go down as one of the most touching moments in cinematic history.",1281484800,3,5750,4.744232698094283
3734302,1,B001OQCV2E,"There is one reason to watch this silly, inane, dreary, ridiculous movie.  Exactly one:

The race to the airport while the world caves in beneath the wheels of the car, the freeway collapses, the sky falls, and the Southern California coastline heaves, buckles, and plonks smack-dab into the Pacific Ocean.  Great special effects, Roland -- I gotta hand it to ya.

There's also a nifty shot of the State of Hawaii turned into one massive erupting volcano, nixing any chance of a refueling during a trans-oceanic flight across the Pacific to China.  Oops.

Other than that, this movie is a multi-gazillion-dollar exercise in silliness.  No coherent plot, the acting is from hunger, characterization is a joke, and the entire basic premise is off the wall.  Mutating neutrinos (whatever the heck that means) cause the earth's crust to destabilize and the whole world first blows itself to smithereenies and then falls into the drink -- all except for Africa, the cradle of civilization, and its regenesis.  About as subtle as a rampaging rhinoceros.

Jeez Louise, even The Day After Tomorrow was better than this mess.  And that is saying a lot.

3734303,1,B001OQCV2E,"My son and I felt dirty and exploited after watching this movie.  Everything about it is wrong:  the premise that the Mayan calendar dictates the end of the world; the snide aside that only China could build the arks, as if America is no longer capable of any significant effort to save itself or the world - a role it's uniquely played for almost 100 years; the silly uniforms the admiral and navy personnel wear on the arks; the wonderfully affirmative and PC cast of the White House and leaders of the arks, particularly the smooth-talking Obama-like scientist-functionary; the rewarded instinct of elitist Ivy-League bureaucrats to preserve themselves instead of the more innocent and deserving whom they serve; the celebration of Africa as the only surviving continent and new home to humanity, with the implicit premise that this is divine retribution for centuries of oppression; the passing reference to how 400,000 people were selected to include a careful distribution of genetic material, as if those created in God's image are so much breeding stock; the triumph we're expected to feel when 5.96 billion out of 6 billion people die so that the Obama administration can live on.

Not only does this flick have a silly and totally unbelievable storyline, but it runs 2 hours and 38 minutes (should have been no more than 90 minutes) long. Though it does have some excellent special effects, the action scenes are ridiculously funny. I'm sure the producers didn't plan it that way.

3734306,4,B001OQCV2E,"Before I begin my review, I must introduce myself as an optimist and a very emotional, sentimental person who usually prefers happy endings. I cry at episodes of cartoon shows, and I tend to become very emotionally invested in anything I watch or read. Despite this, I have a soft spot for disaster movies, the more over the top the better. I went into this movie already having enjoyed Independence Day and The Day After Tomorrow, but unsure how I would receive this. The trailer wowed me, but I was unsure if I could handle a film of this magnitude.

The title of my review ought to speak for itself: far too many come into this film expecting something that is obviously not part of the Roland Emmerich-disaster-film package deal. You ought to know by now that this is Hollywood: there will be contrived coincidences, bogus science and one-in-a-million-chance events happening every time they need to for the purpose of the story. I pity those who snookered themselves into expecting anything less, and do sincerely hope they find the perfectly realistic, even-tempered and dead-serious film about global apocalypse they seemed to have come looking for, even if it hasn't been made yet.

I'll begin with the story: It's an adequate vehicle to carry what we all came to see: the world as we know it coming to an end. As I said, I tend to be sentimental, so I teared up at parts, but most probably will not. The characters are, at least, an interesting array of players and most of the ones that we intimately get to know throughout the film will survive through to the end (I'm also not big on character death, so this was fortunate for me). In addition, Emmerich, fortunately, must have heard the legendary Alfred Hitchcock proclaim that even when you're writing drama and suspense, one must, while winding up the viewer tighter and tighter, let them a little loose with a joke otherwise you'll wind them too tight. Now, this is paraphrased, but my point is is that I appreciated the sporadic, but generally well-placed use of the occasional one-liner to let a little tension out. The pacing of the movie left a little to be desired, as while the film got to the action quickly and delivered relentless one-two punches of scenes of destruction and the ""ark"" scenes were good, the epilogue was far too short, and I ended up wanting a little more exposition on the future of mankind.

The science, or lack thereof, behind the movie: Who cares? It's a film. I happen to be a big fan of science, but one should never let it get in the way of a fun story. Moving on.

The special effects: Generally, they're well done but can be rather overwhelming. Although, I suppose that was to be expected. Most of the best scenes of destruction were in the trailers, so if you've seen those, you've probably seen most of them. Still, don't let that discourage you: it really is how the scenes are framed that provide much of their impact. It is a decent example of stunning visuals supplemented by the writing behind it. The scenes that existed were stunning, but I couldn't help being hungry for a bit more.

The score: I'm a bit of a music geek, so I tend to comment on a film's score as one of my first reactions to seeing it. At all times, the score was appropriate and adequately written, but rarely provided anything exceptional or out of the ordinary for a film score of this variety. It earns a passing grade, certainly, as it does what any film score is meant to do: to elevate the emotions behind the visuals and the writing.

To sum up, any viewer coming into this film really ought to know what to and what not to expect. If you know what to expect, and what you're expecting is what you're hoping to see, you will not be disappointed.",1280275200,5,3734,4.565671641791044
3734307,1,B001OQCV2E,"I was in the mood for a wild, special effects extravaganza - but I didn't know I'd be renting this bomb of writing, directing, and choice special effects.

The director is Roland Emmerich - you'll know him for 'excellent' fare such as Independence Day, Godzilla, The Patriot, The Day After Tomorrow (only Roland would make a global-warming movie about the earth freezing!), and so on. What these movies all have in common is an incredibly-hard-to-swallow over-the-top Karmic irony which sees bad character punished by random, action-oriented coincidence. Horrific disaster is treated like a sort of wonder-of-nature amazement (drinking game: every time they say something like, ""you gotta see this!""). You can see the special effect coming from a mile away! The dramatic irony isn't subtle or thought-provoking, it's just obnoxious. One of these days, one of Roland Emmerich's films is going to come true, and he's going to rightfully say, ""YOU GOTTA SEE THIS!""",1280188800,2,961,5.240259740259741

Mutating neutrinos? What is that? Once you get by the gibberish, you get into a bad script. The actors did what they could to save it, but when the script goes south, Cusack couldn't carry the load. There are long drawn out ridiculous scenes where Cusack barely saves his family as the world collapses only inches behind him. Limos and Winnebagos do not handle like NASCARs. Woody Harrelson as a modern day conspiracy prophet gave us some good moments, I wish there would have been more of him. This movie plays on the hype of 2012. It is for suckers.

3734310,2,B001OQCV2E,"We all know the plot by now: the world as we know it ends by 2012.  Exactly why or how it ends is irrelevant - it ends and Roland Emmerich has used this opportunity to combine every one of his previous disaster movies into one big orgy of destruction.

2012 takes two divergent paths: that of the people in power (the upper class) and that of everyday folks just trying to get along (the middle class). John Cusack is Jackson Curtis, author of a prophetic book titled Farewell Atlantis, has fallen far short of his dreams.  He's a limo driver for a Russian billionaire, is divorced from his wife, and estranged from his kids.  Calamity strikes while Curtis is on a camping trip to Yellowstone National Park with his kids, and it just so happens that he finds a prophet of the apocalypse (Charlie Frost, played by Woody Harrelson) Park is the site of a government coverup. Armed with a map of the elites' plan for survival, Curtis returns home to rescue his wife from certain doom by driving a limo across gaping chasms, through collapsing buildings, and around thousands of dead bodies.

Sorry, did we not mention the dead bodies?  With all the talk of how fun and exciting the special effects are in 2012, it's easy to miss that the film depicts thousands of people dying.  They fall off boats, plunge out of buildings, get hit by cars, are crushed by tsnumais, and burned by explosions.  They are all displayed in tiny, minute detail by Emmerich's special effects team.  This is mass murder, beautifully rendered.

Meanwhile, the heads of state from around the world plan to escape - not by spaceship, but by ark, just like Noah. The American President (Danny Glover) acquits himself admirably but his minions do not, and it's a dog eat dog battle as politicians vie for dominance over the military. There's also the matter of having to buy a ticket to get on the arks, fewer than planned because the apocalypse came a bit earlier than expected.  The irony is that the only country capable of marshalling this level of manufacturing might is China.

2012 seems to run out of ideas about halfway through and then just starts recycling them.  There isn't one but two races for survival as improbable vehicles jump gaping chasms (first a camper, than a limo). There isn't one but two planes escaping from collapsing ground and dodging falling debris.  2012 has one shtick - escape by the skin of your teeth - and plays it over and over.

When that gets tiresome, and without the special effects on the big screen it gets tiresome quickly, issues are invented.  The improbable climax in the ark rivals the stupidity of everything that's gone before, including: a huge gear that powers a titanic door getting stuck by a power cord, the ark is built so that ""if its doors aren't closed the engine won't start,"" and the fact that, in light of a scientist's plea to treat the unruly masses left behind more ethically, even more die as a result of his altruism.

Emmerich has a point to make, and he makes it by blowing up religious and political icons everywhere.  The President won't save you.  America won't save you.  Even God won't save you. The only thing that will save you is a little luck, a lot of perseverance, and Roland Emmerich as your director.

This isn't really a film so much as a series of set pieces.  Every disaster is choreographed in slow motion so we can take in every detail.  As a special effects demo it's great, but as a movie it's merely mediocre.",1280016000,,3469,4.595779220779221

3734353,5,B001OQCV2E,"First a rant about reviewers.  Why do you review a movie, moan, piss, and WHINE if you know you DON'T LIKE that type of movie?  Reviewing a movie to take cheap shots at actors, acting, etc. of a great movie is sad and pathetic.  I don't review chick flick/romances because I don't like them, thus it would be unfair for me to whine like most do and review them.  If you can't keep an open mind and review a film fairly, then shut up and quit reviewing movies badly.

Now the review:  First off this IS a disaster/end of the world movie.  There is sadness, death and destruction.  BUT what I love about this director is that is is NOT all there is to the movie.  Many things are just well written to show us how we are humans are flawed and when we come together it works out in the end.  Just like The Day After Tomorrow, it keeps you on the edge of your seat and just doesn't stop.  Really, this movie DESTROYS The Day After Tomorrow.  I didn't think 2012 would be the best Disaster movie ever TO ME, but it is.  It is a long movie and should be, to not rush the story.  GREAT character development and shows who is ""evil"" and who is ""good"" and shows human nature.  The religions tones are great and don't rub any religion the wrong way unless you are just to uptight and sensitive.

*BEGIN SPOILERS*
I see many whine on here about the government getting saved, well DUH!  Who would pay for such an undertaking?  You also see the evil people in the government get saved, the good people stay and help.  The religious tones are GREAT.  I loved the crack between Adam and God in the Sistine Chapel, which was just one that showed us that as humans we separate ourselves from each other and the divine and in the end, we should come together.  Other religious places are destroyed not just Christian ones.  Nobody should be insulted, it is a message to bring us all together.

The special effects are mind boggling, from volcanoes, to earthquakes etc.  It is just awesome.  Seeing the cities fall apart, dumping people, whole building and such around is destruction never seen on film like this before.  Tidal waves are monstrous and all the ways the earth is ravished makes you just say ""wow"".

*END SPOILERS*

The only negatives is the science in the movie about HOW the earth is going to crap.  Not really sound, but just ignore it as it is not there very long.  The other thing the main characters cheat death a LITTTTLLLEE to much, not to bad, but it was like ""Ok, yet another close call.""  Not bad, but maybe a few to many.

2012 is based on a real theory/belief that the Mayans thought the world would end on December 21, 2012.  You don't have to believe it to enjoy the flix.  Shut up, sit down and enjoy it on blu ray and turn the surround sound UP.

'2012' has too many moments where I felt the actors were actually trying to make this story seem believable, but in their action made the film even more unbelievable. One instance of this is when the main characters are aboard a plane trying to reach the arks and the family decides to take a nap??!

In the end, it was the Nina, the Pinta, and the Santa Maria once again arriving on the shores of the ""New World"".* Washed up upon the land of promise by the good, guiding hands of Wealth, Prestige and Good Fortune. John Cusack strokes his daughter's hair and says, ""Niiice.""

*This time, it's the lucky continent of Africa (which forces of deep spiritual evil have been warring over since time immemorial, although they have certainly picked up the pace over the past hundred years plus, even as most of us in the West have been sheltered from what horrors are being carried out in that land, being led to believe that it is just hapless ignorants slaughtering each other--- nothing could be further from the truth!).

There was plenty of whizz-bang thrillitry and seat-of-your-pants excitement, but what I enjoyed most about 2012 was the scattered, yet continuous, references to Wisconsin. The ""Badger State"" is finally getting her due, even if it IS in a movie about the end of the world (as we know it). O well, gotta start somewhere, I suppose. They even narrowed in on my general location at one point, thanks to their generous usage of sonar-radio-gadgetry amd latest, most up-to-date computech wizardry.

What excitement though, eh? They were really pulling out all the stops in their desperate bid for survival! I'm not sure how many times that family cheated certain death (I lost count after I ran out of toes), but it was more than a couple! John ""The Ultimate"" Cusack even swam underwater and saved their skins just in time like good heroes do, and, true to form, he got the girl in the end, even if it meant that the good-hearted-yet-slightly-snivelling-and-far-less-manly rival had to be ground to mush in the gearing to make it happen. At least he served his purpose and flew the planes good for awhile!

Truthfully, I ended up with the conclusion after watching this film that this was like the Illuminati (whoever they are) Dancing With The Stars! on our collective grave, glorifying their accomplishments and baiting all the ""little people"" with false hope that they will be the family portrayed by John Cuzack & co., that they will be along for the ride* when it all comes down, washing up on the shores of the Cape of Good Hope as little gods and goddesses content and intent on replenishing and repeating all the follies of the past.

*That at the proverbial 11th hour, fifty-ninth minute and fifty-ninth second they would crawl through the hydraulics and wriggle their way aboard the ark.

This movie is undoubtedly a metaphor for what is in the works. In many cases, an all-too-real metaphor, although the reality will be a little less CGI and a lot more horrific (according to what I read in my Bible). Our overlords know that their power comes from the devil who has granted them their kingdom here on earth. They know that Christ WILL return, for although their master may be the Great Deceiver, he is no fool and he is manipulating them to prepare for the return of Christ (which will lay ruin to all their plans) by preparing for Armegeddon. They've set up their HAARP systems and their underground bunkers and their ""alien"" space aircraft to play defense should this planet be laid waste as it is foretold in the book of Revelation. Do they know something that their system has convinced most of the rest of us is only fairytales and foolishness? Are they lulling the masses asleep for a reason far more insidious than we ever imagined?

There IS Hope my friend.

3734361,1,B001OQCV2E,"It's hard to elaborate on the deservedly scathing reviews 2012 has
received; it's not only physically implausible, but it indulges in the
worst kind of racial stereotyping. And naturally, it's the Americans
who run the show and get to survive for the most part. We're meant to
identify with a self-centered family group from Southern California
that indulges in soap opera dialog with each other even as their
friends and neighbors (even eventually their good-guy stepdad) are
slaughtered. The only thing that's supposed to matter to them is
""family."" The African-American President's wife is dead as is the
mother of the African-American scientist protagonist. The fact that the
middle-aged black women are dead before the movie even starts speaks
for itself since there's a lot of discussion about who ""deserves"" to
survive the catastrophe. An elderly Tibetan woman gets to live (even
though she doesn't speak English, a major character flaw in a film like
this) because she can virtuously save the white protagonists (who
probably wouldn't do the same for her if the tables were turned). The
CG effects are dramatic, but pointless because they're designed to be
sensational and nothing else. There's a protracted water scene (that I
fast-forwarded over) at the end of the film that is somehow supposed to
do with re-uniting the John Cusack character with his petulent son. The
earth has been destroyed, the majority of the world's population has
died an agonizing death and we're supposed to care about this?
Eventually the (mostly white) survivors set out to repopulate the lone
inhabitable continent, Africa. Colonialism begins again. Every single
moment of this film is truly and bizarrely bad.",1279497600,,1700,5.1854545454545455

I was just looking to be mindlessly entertained.  It had all the makings of a good disaster film: good actors, interesting sub-plots, and lots of special effects (or CG).  But I found this film to be rather disappointing.  According to the ratings, more people hated it than loved it.  In trying to figure out why it was such a disappointment to me and maybe others, I could say the makers of this film insulted our intelligence over and over again in order to supposedly create suspense.  There are too many examples to cite, but primarily the special effects were so over the top and unbelievable that I couldn't buy into it.  In order to entertain, the makers of a film have to make you believe that what you are seeing could actually happen, even for a second.  It wasn't the CG on the destruction that I didn't believe; that was pretty good.  It was how the main characters of the film just barely escaped demise every turn of the way.  Too unbelievable to be fully entertaining.  Bottom line: this film is watchable and mildly entertaining, but suffers from sappy sub-plots and over the top special effects that insult your intelligence.",1279411200,,1288,4.5964912280701755

3734431,2,B001OQCV2E,"Strip away the glitzy special effects and you've got yourself a very 70s style Irwin Allen disaster flick, with occasional smatterings of the The Poseidon Adventure and Titantic thrown in for good measure. You've seen these characters many times before (heroic mom and her ex-husband, bravely facing certain death in the devestating apocolypse now upon them - without losing their perkiness..their two precious little waifs..the good politican, the bad politician, the Russian mobster...the extremely smart scientist ...and a little dog too!)

The plot grows dumber and more predictable with every dragging minute, and I found myself wishing it would end about an hour before it finally did. Perhaps the most absurd moment is at the very end, when our heroine mom (Amdanda Peet) emerges from the ark after her death-defying ordeal perfectly coiffed and lipsticked with several hundred other survivors who didn't even appear to get wet.  When did they have time to pack or shop, and how come it took her less than 10 minutes to fall back in love with her ex-husband after the boyfriend that saved all of their lives met a gruesome end in the machinery of the ark's malfunctioning gate?

A couple of stars for the special effects - they were fun, but they're too often expected to compensate for the lack of a fresh, creative storyline. Sadly, they don't. Some bright spots though - Oliver Platt and Danny Glover turn in pretty good performances, but they would have fared better in a more serious movie. And then there's Woody Harrelson, the slightly deranged, grungy herald of the coming apolocapsye, who tips you off up front about the silliness to come.

3734434,4,B001OQCV2E,"2012 is Roland Emmerich's version of another disaster movie but this time the end of the world is supposed to happen in Dec 2012 - hence the name of the movie. It's a well balanced kind of disaster movie in comparison to other works such as Independence Day or Day After Tomorrow, with John Cusack leading the star cast. But never has so much destruction shown on film than 2012 with outstanding special effects, buildings falling over, cars thrown over, etc. The ending seems to be a bit wary and could have been tweaked but its just a personal opinion but overall an enjoyable experience.
The video transfer is a top notch 1080p transfer(2.39:1) with exquisite detail shown most of the times. Especially in the disaster sequences, the viewer can clearly see the fine details of distant objects too.  2012 explodes onto blu ray with a wonderful DTS-HD MA lossless 5.1 soundtrack which does not fail to satisfy the ears.

3734436,4,B001OQCV2E,"I'm coming out of the closet right now. I'm a Roland Emmerich apologist. Independence Day was a seminal film of my childhood. Godzilla was an entertaining/memorable film. I've probably seen The Day After Tomorrow more than any human should. And I am one of the few that remember and kind of like 10,000 BC. Thusly, I was in the theater Day 1 for 2012. A true Master of Disaster, nobody can destroy the Earth like Roland Emmerich can.

But first of all, there's setup. Wait? What? Roland Emmerich blows stuff up, Roland Emmerich doesn't do character development! I'll also admit right now that 2012 probably could have been cut down, expecially in the first 30 minutes, since it is too long of a movie, and it takes a bit too long for the Earth to start crumbling down. But even so, the actors do fine with what they're given. John Cusack is John Cusack, Danny Glover is underused, Chiwetel Ejiofor did the best with bad material, and Amanda Peet should never be allowed to be in a film again. And again, while the plot is serviceable for the destruction, the parts where the Earth was getting the crap kicked out of it could have been cut down. As for the Mayan Prophecy, stupid? Yes. Serviceable for giving an excuse to pulverize the Earth? Yes.

First major action sequence: Los Angeles crumbles apart in a GIANT Earthquake. How crazy is this scene? A car drives through a collapsing building. Believable? No. Fun to watch? Oh yeah. Then we get to see Las Vegas get hit by that same GIANT Earthquake. How crazy is this scene? We get to see a plane dive below and above collapsing hotels. That's pretty exiting. Then we get to see the Super Volcano at Yellowstone blow its top. Believable? No. Fun? It lingers a little too long, but yes. Then from there, it's just a crapstorm of disasters. The Vatican comes down, making for some religious symbolism. Cruise ships get flipped over by waves. The White House is crused by an Aircraft Carrier. All variety of places are hit by giant waves and are flooded. A plane crashes and its occupants have to get off by using expensive sports cars. Again, while you do have to wait a while to see all this happen, it's incredibly satisfying & cool when you actually get to them.

But what I also love about 2012 is the absolute insanity of it. There's a scene where two characters are saying how they're feeling apart from each other, just for a GIANT crack to open up between them in the ground. The movie even takes the all-popular crazy, but correct guy and takes him to the next level with Woody Harrelson. Nothing is destroyed in a nice way, or just a simple explosion or anything, no, it's long, it's drawn out, it's destructive, and it's a beautiful thing to watch. At least for me it is. Your opinion may differ. I mean, there's a scene where an ""Ark"" is fixing to crash into the Summit of Mt. Everest, aka the highest mountain in the world! INSANITY! And they squeeze the scene out with everything that it's worth, then some. If this isn't Roland Emmerich's love letter to his admirers, like me, I don't know what is.

Overall, 2012 is the CGI grandfather of all disaster films. The SyFy channel & other disaster movies spend two hours on what takes 30 seconds here. Remember Poseidon Adventure? You get that in a cooler looking 30 second sequence. Have you ever watched Category 6, or one of the many other SyFy channel crapfests that aim to destroy the world on a measly budget? Yeah, I have, and 2012 takes a dump on those films in all its two-hundred million dollar budget glory. So as unpleasant, or as poorly scripted and drawn-out as 2012 may be at times, it's Disaster Porn at some of its finest.",1277078400,,3651,4.518910741301059
3734437,3,B001OQCV2E,"For a movie that's entitled ""2012,"" you would expect some info on the Mayan prophecies or something. But since this is a film by Roland Emmerich, we get very little of it. Instead, we have a bloated action adventure with spectacular special effects.....and that's about it. Now, I don't have anything against Emmerich (I happen to like ""Independence Day""), it's just that his movies look like they're just an excuse to put in some lovely special effects (except ""The Patriot,"" obviously). There isn't much story or character development; they're pretty bad, but they're not really terrible. The lack of story and character is also evident here in ""2012."" I can't exactly care about the characters in this movie; the only people I like are the Harry (Blu Mankuma) & the Russian pilot (Johann Urb). They're only supporting characters, and that's a bad sign considering none of the main characters are interesting enough for me to like them. And yes, the scientific accuracy in this movie is highly questionable. There are so many impossible scenarios and so many predictable turning points that you realize that the movie's specialty is only special effects and suspense. But I guess ""2012"" succeeds in what it's trying to be: a mindless, overwrought, unrealistic two-and-a-half hour disaster film with some pretty nice CGI effects and some pretty intense moments. This is basically a standard popcorn movie: if you're looking for a solid plot, deep character development, witty dialogue, and originality, then you better look somewhere else. I could care less about ""2012"" but at least it looked good.

The formula of ""divorced-family-complications and kids not relating to dad so well"" is obviously ripped in total from every Steven Spielberg movie ever made (except Schindler's List).

I kept saying to myself, ""This is like that remake of Godzilla. I'm supposed to laugh here as the President and the White House are crushed by a tidal wave slamming down a US aircraft carrier on them.""

Now I've done a bit of surfing on Amazon, and I get it with the listing of Roland Emmerich's films.

3734508,3,B001OQCV2E,"I was expecting the movie to be a bigger disaster than the earthquakes and floods.  It wasn't that horrible.  Roland Emerich is a bad director, but it could have been worse.  In a nutshell, extreme solar flares have heated up the earth's core to where it is shifting the Earth's crust like never before.  Huge earthquakes devastate the world.  Gargantuan tsunami's end up covering most of the earth.  You have your standard scientist, actually well played by Chiwetel Ejiofor, running around trying to convince the powers at be that the end of the world is coming.  Unlike previous movies, they actually listen to the guy.  The world leaders, in secret, come up with a plan to save a small portion of humanity (around 500,000) in these big ships they build, called Arks.  Most of the story revolves around John Cusak's character and his desperate attempt to save his family.  The strength of this movie is obviously the special effects.  They are breathtaking.  Some of the best you will ever see.  The weakness of the movie, predictably, is the characters and story line.  It's amazing how these idiot characters are facing Armageddon, yet they always seem to take their time with everything.  In one scene, the fate of one of these gigantic ships hangs in the balance.  Thousands of lives are at stake with only minutes save them.  Yet, the hero has time to stop and talk to his son and kiss his ex-wife a few times.  No hurry at all, even with a woman drowning in the next compartment.  It happens again when a runway is collapsing all around, but the pilot wants to do some pre-flight checks.  It's really stupid.  Many of the actors, are just plane flops.  Amanda Peet and the kids never really look all the frightened at times.  In one part they are seeing thousands of people dying everywhere, yet barely a scared look on their faces.  I imagine real people would be in a state of shock.  They only seemed to get emotional whenever John Cusak was in trouble, which was every single minute of the film.

3734514,4,B001OQCV2E,"Yes, it's derivative, style over substance, cheesy and predictable.  And yet, in spite of - or perhaps because of, these flaws, it's rollicking good fun.  If approached firmly tongue in cheek, accompanied by a popcorn frame of mind, it's a pretty good watch.  Make no mistake though, if you are annoyed by effects driven blockbuster movies which defy logic and even science, then this film is not for you.
The movie follows fairly routine disaster movie narrative conventions.. there are disposable characters, and then the little guy caught up in the middle that we identify with, the scientists and politicians trying to come up with a resolution, and of course, being a Roland Emmerich film (Independence Day, The Day before Tomorrow, Godzilla) a dog with uncanny abilities to get out of tough scrapes.  In this case, solar storms are having a disastrous effect on the earth's molten innards, with a resulting realignment of the crust.  What does that mean?  Well, it means that along with scientific credibility going out the window, we get not one of the usual disaster scenarios - we get every disaster scenario you ever saw before, all shoehorned into one movie.  From Poseidon to Volcano, from Earthquake to The Day the Earth caught Fire, When Time Ran Out to... wow, yes, even actually some hints of Titanic.  It's all way too much for one movie to actually create a credible storyline which maintains suspense, but switch the brain off, allow a goofy grin to come over your face as the characters race from one peril to the next with only seconds between them and doom, while admiring the prolific computer generated effects (which sadly rarely generate any real feeling of impending threat  to the heroes / heroines) - and the movie somehow works.
Most of the cast play things fairly straight - that's ok, when the situations present all the tongue in cheek required.  The exception is the ludicrously yet wonderfully over the top Woody Harrelson, as the proverbial prophet of doom..
It would be silly to dwell on the negative points.  That would entirely  miss the point of the movie... It sets out to show some big screen effects driven thrills, with the brain required to be firmly in neutral, and that's what it does.  The tagline of the movie was `We Were Warned'.

It just starts there folks.  This movie is a joke.

The scientist no one will listen to who knows the world is ending has been done to DEATH...the relationship between John Cusack's character and his ex-wife is stupid and predictable from the opening credits...the Russian billionaire with brat kids who wins us over in the end is some of the worst acting since, well, Woddy Harrelson in the scene right before it.

Another bad decision was selecting John Cusack as the lead character.  There are a lot of movies I would go see him in, but this is not a good fit. Has he ever played a role where he isn't a writer?

The disaster scenes are too far over the edge of believablity...even for a disaster movie.  So far over the edge you find yourself distracted by it throghout the disaster scenes.  Special effects should improve the look of the scenes, not create new and exciting laws of physics.  Even the easy stuff is exagerrated.  I like how Woody Harrelson's RV radio signal can be heard 1000 miles away while the Earth is falling apart.

I can't quite put my finger on it but there is some kind of anti US undertone in there somewhere.  That is more and more and more common it seems.  Especially when the world is coming to an end.

3734518,1,B001OQCV2E,"I was first introduced to disaster films when I was in college and immediately fell in love! From Danger: Volcano in New York to Dragon Wars to The Day After Tomorrow, I was hooked on apocalyptic movies for good. When I first saw a trailer for 2012, I was honestly scared. I had heard about the Mayan calendar and knew that some people believed that the world will end in two years but I just thought that it was a revival of the Y2K nuts and by 2013 we would have a Family Guy episode mocking the event just like we did in 2001. However, the trailer for the movie actually frightened me and I refused to see it for fear I would have some sort of attack in the theater. When it came out on DVD a couple of weeks ago, I couldn't help myself. The disaster lover in me needed to watch John Cusack get washed away by a giant tidal wave that pushed an air craft carrier onto the White House lawn. After the movie was over, the credits rolled and I had realized that I had fallen asleep twice, I thought that 2012 was even worse than Komodo vs. Cobra and not nearly as compelling.

2012 follows the same formula as most disaster movies, dead beat divorced dad realizes that the world is going to end and wants to save his children and ex-wife who are more shocked that he has come back into their lives than they are by the extinction of the human race in less than 2 hours (movie time). Cusack plays a writer who has written a book about the apocalypse that no one has read and those who did hated it...oh, won't they be mad when it all comes true and they only read the SparkNotes version! The first disaster occurs when Los Angeles is ripped apart by an earthquake and falls into the ocean and the nation is shocked (hasn't the discovery channel been telling us that for decades?). Cusack, kids, and ex-wifey all escape and try to outrun the apocalypse by flying to Las Vegas (because of course Las Vegas will survive the apocalypse...it's like a cockroach) and eventually China where the government is housing giant ""arks"" that will only hold a certain amount of people but can assure that those people will survive the disaster. Of course they meet all kinds of international people on their journeys all of whom are walking stereotypes.

The movie runs over two hours for an event that could be summarized in one sentence: only science fiction authors and wealthy Americans can defeat big waves. The most irritating aspect of the film is that the acting wasn't good but it wasn't terrible therefore it was difficult to make fun of! It was also disturbing that everyone's favorite characters die and dumb daddy dead beat lives with the promise to his children of being a better father. Personally, I was not invested in the daddy-kiddie relationship and therefore did not care about his future role model status.

Some of the graphics were cool but not scary. Yet even this did not sustain my attention for though I didn't miss a second of The Gathering, I fell asleep twice during 2012 and knew that I hadn't missed anything. So I guess the moral for the future is that when 2012 actually comes, I'll probably sleep right through that as well!",1274313600,5,3143,4.4626086956521736

However I will point out one thing about this movie that probably other reviews won't cover and that is Emmerich's use of the Genesis HD video camera to film some of the live action sequences.  The use of this camera, especially during the underwater action sequences at the end was extremely distracting in the fact that it does not look like film at all but video.  You can notice this by the smoothness of the action and it looks more 'TV' like.

I understand this was Emmerich's first use of this camera but I don't think enough effort was put into making these sequences 'film' like.  When you compare to the rest of the movie these scenes stick out like a sore thumb.

Well, I'm not exactly sure this is what happens in 2012, since the discussion of the science is pretty weak.  But the result is the same.

End of times.

Except, for those in the know, there are those ships being built by the united world governments, to save humanity...

This story follows a novelist (John Cusack) and his family as they try to escape the earthquakes, collapsing buildings, ash clouds, rising waters, and general mayhem as they search for these ships.  The ships were discovered by a conspiracy-theorist late-night radio talk show host (Woody Harrelson) broadcasting from his RV in Yellowstone National Park.

Cusack is initially saved from the destruction of southern California by the flying skills of his ex-wife's new partner, who magically knows how to take-off, fly, and land a twin engine prop with only a couple flying lessons under his belt.  And this group of travelers always is on the very edge of extinction, and I mean the very edge.

And where does all that water come from... enough to rise to engulf most the Himalayas?

He has been noted for the destruction of the world in such flicks as Independence Day, Godzilla (ok, it was not the world, but New york City had the notoriety of being destroyed by a giant lizard!) & The Day After Tommorrow, has served us his latest, 2012!
If you love movies depicting any natural disasters, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, floods, tsunamis, avalanches & complete city-wide devastation, this is the movie for you. I am so glad he did include a meteor or an asteroid or a comet! The special effects are spectacular, the drama level is very much close to home.

It jumps immediately into action, and it never lets up- there are no dull moments in this movie!  For those who are worried about 2012, this will feed their fear beautifully, for those who are not, it is a good, rousing movie, guaranteed to entertain!  While it may be scary for some younger viewers, it is to be noted that there is no gratuitous sex, bad language is minimal, and appropriate for the scene, and while there is violence, it is not the exaggerated and overplayed bloody gore of human-against-human so common in action flicks these days.  Indeed, this movie tends to give one hope that perhaps we are worth saving, after all!
  John Cusack, not notoriously known for his action movies, performs admirably in this one.  The whole cast was really top-notch.  The one who stands out, and actually has one of the smaller roles, is Woody Harrelson.  Utterly believable as the 'doomsday jock', he plays one who really believes what he is saying, to the point of seeing it through to the end.

3734567,2,B001OQCV2E,"Noah never had it so good.  All he had was a lot of rain. Now thanks to CGI we have earthquakes, volcano eruptions, tsunami's and other explosions and fireballs that makes the end of the world seem like fun.  Ouch! John Cusack with two small children, an ex-wife and her new husband in tow helps start a brave new world. With Cusack and his ex still having feelings for each other you just know the new husband will die.  He does.  Woody Harrelson has a brief role as a tree-hugging conspiracy nut-case who believes when the world ends we will all fly off in spaceships.

The main and top-most problem with the movie is it's ridiculousness. Since Cusack is the star he has the super-human ability to survive road chasms, they open up just as he passes, skyscrapers tumble and the debris misses his car as he drives by, bridges collapse and in mid-collapse he sails under in his stretch limousine. He is a limo driver who earns his bread and butter driving rich folks around while he forgets he was once a novelist whose first book sold 422 copies.

After we're treated to seeing famous landmarks destroyed including the vatican with the Pope in mid-prayer and a Tibetian temple with a monk in mid-prayer, everyone who's anyone, with a few thousand nobodies and animals all end up on an ark. And to make some kind of point that escapes me, the everyone who's anyone are politicians. Egads! I think I'll pass on that trip.

The movie at 2 hours 38 minutes is a bit long for an old-fashioned Saturday afternonn time-waster but the special effects are good.

Whether it was intentional or not the movie offers up a tribute to the old Sanford and Son TV series that starred Redd Foxx.  Whenever Fred Sanford wanted his own way he would clutch his chest and talking to his dead wife would say ""I'm coming Elizabeth, I'm coming""  Danny Glover plays the president whose wife has passed and when he looks out the White House window and sees a tidal wave coming, he looks up to heaven and says, ""I'm coming Elizabeth, I'm coming home"".",1272758400,,2025,4.538461538461538

He also had a much better script to work with...a real one !

Just substitute a rogue planet and a spaceship for rogue neutrinos (""Whaaaatttt???"") and an ""Ark"", and you have the same, basic plot, including the (same) non deserving heirarchy trying to take priority over the (same)hoi-poloi.

You could easily clip at least an hour from this tedious movie and never miss it, and the ending is protracted beyond belief.

3734615,1,B001OQCV2E,"""2012"" is a preposterous, dreadfully long disaster film that mostly exists for action director Roland Emmerich to obliterate the planet Earth again. If that's the *point* well, make a new *point* already.

Replacing aliens and ice hurricanes as the agent of destruction are shifting tectonic plates that trigger massive earthquakes, volcanic explosions and tsunamis. I'm not sure how a 28,000-foot wave could conceivably occur without the Earth splitting in two, but some scientist surely hypothesized it might, and so it goes in ""2012."" A dad takes his kids from Los Angeles to Yellowstone in a limo, too. That's a 17-hour drive and, oh, $400 in gas, both ways, considering the mountain ranges. On a limo driver's salary. They could visit Yosemite, but, hey, the Yellowstone Supervolcano has to worm its way into the film somehow.

Typical of a Emmerich film, ""2012"" is divided into three parts: the build-up, the blow-up and the tear-up. Scientists foretell worldwide destruction based on the sun's violent activity. For once the world's governments listen, convene in secret and raise money to build giant arks by charging millions for a survival ticket.

Limo driver Jackson Curtis doesn't have millions. But since he's played by John Cusack, you can bet two rib dinners that, after nearly three hours of carnage, he'll be within shouting distance of one of those arks, and in the final stages of patching together a broken marriage to Kate (Amanda Peet) for the sake of two moppets they've spawned. After all, Jackson and Kate have survived the destruction of LA, Yellowstone, Las Vegas already, plus a crash landing on a sheet of ice while driving a Merecedes-Benz out the back of the plane. What's a slimy bureaucrat (Oliver Platt) bent on keeping the arks full of the ""best and richest"" against those kinds of survival instincts?

Since the well-timed enviro-themed ""The Day After Tomorrow"" in 2004, Emmerich appears to be stumbling around in a CGI desert, just throwing any damn thing on the screen. There are name actors in ""2012"" - Cusack, Peet, Platt, Danny Glover, Thandie Newton, Chiwetel Ejiofor - and they say some stuff, but it's the same recycled, human spirit nonsense you've always heard. You aren't watching ""2012"" for the insight, but the rubble. The destruction is complete - and occasionally clever - but simply too beyond the pale of reasonable belief; prop planes can't fly through three farts in the wind, much less the collapse of every major building in Los Angeles. The Yellowstone volcano, when it ever does erupt, isn't going to be something you can drive away from in an RV. And while Woody Harrelson plays a pretty good apocalyptic kook, you can't expect him to channel the spirit of Dennis Hopper while Hopper still draws breaths mixed with shots of Johnnie Walker.

And this matters because, in the head-numbing final act of ""2012,"" viewers are subjected to a distress so minor, so arbitrary, so overused, so ""real"" but so ordinary that you feel your nerves getting pulled so Emmerich can be ironic - in times of such destruction, it's still the smallest things! - and squeeze the last cent out of that massive $200 million budget. The new thrills, mixed with the old ones! No. There's a difference between suspense and the irritation that kicks in at the two-hour, 15-minute mark when Cusack's gasping for breath and you're thinking, invariably, about the 73 times you've already seen this scene, your finger poised on the fast forward button.",1272153600,2,3480,4.982788296041308

When all hell is literally exploding around them, some idiot always races back to an inferno or the scene of a nightmare to retrieve something. In this case, while a plane is trying to take off from a landing strip while around are exploding fireballs and the ground caving in, John Cusack races back to a burning van to find some stupid map. The same thing happened in Emmerich's miserable Godzilla, where a photographer races back to grab his camera from the ground--although there are six monstrous dinosaurs racing to devour him.

In this movie, while the earth is imploding, along with tidal waves and earthquakes galore, the president and his staff all move around as if life is still going on.  Danny Glover as the US President acts like he's suffering from acute constipation in all his scenes, barely raising his voice above a pained whisper.

Children shriek continuously and the main characters always have time to discuss life while the end of the world is occuring.

At first, the spectacular destruction of Mother Earth was fun and exciting. After awhile mostly because of the idiocy of the characters, I just turned off the sound while flipping through my latest copy of National Enquirer.

In every scene they keep repeating the same concept, where the characters are trying to drive or fly away and the road is collapsing just behind them, missing them as buildings are falling in towards them and just missing them. They keep repeating this same concept and you're left thinking; ""No way they used that again!"" the whole movie. Then they get on these giant boats and someone says ""where headed towards the face of Everest and if we don't get the engines started we're going to hit"". Lol I can't imagine a more cheesy line.

Famous deaf Russian Konstantin Tsiolkovsky - the grandfather of modern astronautics and the Russian Jules Verne quoted that ""Earth is the cradle of mankind, but one cannot live in the cradle forever.""  Therefore, we cannot live forever on the only human life-support planet Earth.  The NASA space program is truly essential for the survival of American civilization and the world humanity.  We must continue to go beyond our fragile life-support planet Earth to explore in outer space in order to preserve our species of homo-sapiens by spreading out and creating human colonies in the vast universe in order to save our humanity from its extinction. We must speedily up to build a whole fleet of starships to evacuate the people and animals from dying Earth, and leave the planet Earth quickly before the planet Earth will rupture and obliterate our human civilization in 2012.

US government, especially today's President Obama, has a lack of vision in setting priorities for the human space exploration and colonization since early 1970s.  We are to be permanently stuck on Earth in secluded.  Our species of homo-sapiens will be at stake for our planetary survival in the critical crisis.

Why does Obama want us to wait two or three decades to send humans to the planet Mars, and other planets and satellites that support life?  Then it will be too little and too late for America to send humans on planetary exploration and colonization.  Our species of homo-sapiens cannot survive beyond the apocalypse year of 2012.

3734679,1,B001OQCV2E,"I watched this movie for the special effects.  I was prepared for a juvenile script, cartoon-ish characters, bad acting and lots of nonsense.  Movies in this genre, being part morality play, have their maudlin interludes, sermons and sappy dialog, but this movie hit the ""Pause"" button excessively.

The nonsense was at a level traditionally found only in parodies (example: To accommodate the lead characters, a continent moves thousands of miles at supersonic speeds and then snaps back to its original position, all with no apparent side-effects and no one else noticing).  Consequently, many of the intended thrills didn't work for me because I couldn't shift gears fast enough from laughing or shaking my head at the preposterous setups.

One of the joys of good CGI is that you don't get taken out of the moment by disconcerting problems in the perspective, shading, motion,...--the CGI models are sophisticated enough to get the physics ""close-enough"".  While the CGI here was very sophisticated in its treatment of individual elements, such as crowds and the collapse of buildings, critical modeling capabilities appear to have been overridden causing the composite to be surprisingly unsophisticated, reminiscent of FX of movies in the 1930s, 40s and 50s. For example, tsunamis play a large role in the movie, but what we see is essentially the very old-fashion ""models in a bathtub"" version that is nothing like what we saw in videos of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami or in real life experience with large bodies of water.

TEST (relevance to you): Look at the cover art. For the background, I see a seascape with wind-whipped waves that are no more than a few feet tall.  And the amount of foam around the monastery tells me that it is a small model.  If this doesn't register with you, you may not have these problems with the FX (I have friends in this category).  On the other hand, if you notice that the monastery is much too small to dominant a mountain peak--dimensions extrapolated from it being only three stories tall--you are likely to have constant problems with the FX.

Similarly, I was disappointed that the model for the destruction of the LA skyscrapers seemed to be largely based on deconstruction (by implosion?) rather than the more dramatic swaying, twisting and ripping that is found in models of collapses during earthquakes.

For me, the big CGI sequence of the flight through the destruction of LA was negated by the how poorly the aircraft was pasted into the action.  First, even though the plane should have been gaining altitude after it took off from the airport, for many miles it was at or below ground level (in the chasm).  Second, the plane felt badly out-of-scale with enough of the objects that it was flying past that this destroyed the illusion. I suspect that the CGI perspective functionality was overridden to move objects to more completely fill the screen.

The _overall_ feel of the FX is that they are quite repetitive and derivative of earlier movies.  This dilutes the effects because they are so predictable, which is further diluted by the long, boring interludes.

In disaster movies, the thrills are delivered by visuals that build on an underlying dramatic tension.  In good disaster movies, some/many of the characters you are rooting for die, and some of the bad guys manage to elude death before eventually succumbing.  But here, there is none of that tension.  Most of the action involves the hero (Cusack) and since his survival is never in doubt, there is no sense of danger (Watch the ground failure chase Cusack. It's gaining on him! Uh oh, it's gotten ahead! But he manages to jump to safety at the last moment! Hurray! Interlude.  Repeat).

And for the other characters, the movie almost immediately telegraphs who will die, and they obligingly die on schedule.  Plus the movie generated absolutely no investment in any of the characters.",1271548800,10,3911,4.946483180428134

Going to see a Roland Emmerich (director) film can be dicey at the best of times, and downright ugly if you're unfortunate. Arguably his greatest film was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stargate/dp/B002KPINY8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stargate</a>&nbsp;which was spun off into a highly successful TV series on the SciFi Channel. But some fans are divided on others such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Independence-Day/dp/B000WQWPKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Independence Day</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godzilla/dp/0767817478/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godzilla</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Patriot/dp/B000PAAJVA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Patriot</a>. Then we get into the ""bad"" category with Moon 44, The Day After Tomorrow, and 10,000 B.C. (I think a little vomit came up the back of my throat for that last one).

If you've seen any world doom films in the past 15 years, you'll not see anything that'll surprise you here. Things like DEEP IMPACT and ARMAGEDDON are pretty much a dime a dozen nowadays. And so goes 2012 ...but with a really poor script and some serious miscasting.

Although John Cusack was an early childhood favorite of mine, starring in such low-brow comedies as BETTER OFF DEAD and ONE CRAZY SUMMER, he's grown into much more substantial roles in subsequent years, shining in HIGH FIDELITY, WAR, INC., and the astounding&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Identity/dp/B000MNOX7Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Identity</a>. But here John appears to have gone after the money. Reading the script, one can't help but wonder why anyone would choose to be in it. It really has no viable characters and relies solely on its massive special effects budget. But the actors did come. And not just Mr. Cusack.

Chiwetel Ejiofor (can anyone pronounce his name?) tries to give some additional star power but can't grab any traction, either. Too bad. He's become quite a versatile actor, going from the feminine&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kinky-Boots/dp/B000GFLE1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kinky Boots</a>&nbsp;to the rugged&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Serenity/dp/B001KOFH2G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Serenity</a>.

Thandie Newton (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Crash/dp/B000EWBKLW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Crash</a>) gives the film even more eye-candy as the attractive daughter to the President. But here she is more caricature than character, giving some of the worst lines in the entire film.

Oliver Platt (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frost-Nixon/dp/B001TH93GU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frost/Nixon</a>) tries to play ""the bad politician"" and his lines, like Thandie Newton's, are so ridiculously contrived as to be laughable.

The only saving grace - acting-wise -  was the role of Charlie Frost, a conspiracy theorist, played by Woody Harrelson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zombieland/dp/B002WY65W4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zombieland</a>).

- While the acting isn't bad, the characters are cliches to the point of being flat caricatures.

- When people were saying goodbye to their loved ones, the conversations were too short to be believable.  Surely, they would have wanted to say a lot more?

- The special effects often look evidently fake (to my engineer's eye).

- The frequent near-miss escapes from disaster strain credulity past the breaking point.

- It's a bit odd how Americans are able to maintain authority over the situation even after all of the top leadership of the US government has been wiped out.

- It makes no sense that the US president wouldn't have stayed with the group on the arks in order to provide continuing leadership.

- I have serious doubts that the gears of the ark door could have been jammed so easily.

- The building of the arks would have been funded by governments, not rich people.

- The notion that a large burst of neutrinos would start interacting in a new way with other matter and greatly heat the earth's core is simply implausible.

- Given all the uncertainties involved, how could they have predicted that the arks wouldn't have been destroyed by earthquakes or other natural events before being launched?

- How did the himalayas get flooded?  Where did all that water come from?  I can't see a tsunami doing that.

The filmed an end of the world disaster. We've seen them all before... only this time it's the politicians playing God and withholding information from the people. The funny part is that they wait till the last minute to tell people what is happening...but by the time they tell them this the State of California has already sunk into the ocean and a massive Volcanic erruption occurs at yellow stone... Yes... I'm sure everyone hasn't figured out to ""RUN THE HELL FOR THEIR LIVES!"" and they really are depending on the Government at that point to lead them. Yeah.... right. The entire movie seems to revolve around this plot of being moral and doing what is right. Yet... the people that get saved are all the immoral politcal leaders and super wealthy that couldn't care less about the people they step on.

  What point does it make being a politcal leader and fleeing your country leaving your people to die while you escape safely. Yes... that's exactly the type of trash that make it to safety in this movie.. and all for the sake of humanity. Sure... if that's what humanity is down to than we are already doomed. The more interesting part about the movie is that it's ideal that a plot like this could happen. The lower classes of society always get the short end of the stick. In the end it always comes down to status... but strangely enough what good is money when the economy has been destroyed by mother nature herself?

 The Kings didn't build the Pyramids.. the slaves built them. It's the working class that drives society... not politicians that judge the world from affar. It's just funny watching this movie thinking what sort of world will be created by these people.

On top of that the movie itself is a lot of long winded speeches and even one when there's only but a few minutes left till doomsday and the politicians are still playing God decided the fates of people. When will they learn that without the people they have no power or authority? I suppose that's the part of the film that made this ""fiction"". How everyone kept order and all of sudden no longer worried about their own families because they were so set on saving politicians and Giraffs (ok well the animals were worth it). Very unrealistic... who would continue to work for these slimes knowing that they wouldn't get another paycheck?

On top of that you can put the annoying main family that added nothing to the film. They were the classic family in distress. Annoying kids yelling mommy... save daddy where's daddy yatta yatta.

It is true that our politicians have made amenities for themselves in mountains, etc, but to think they'll let the common folk on an ""ark"" and then we can start over, well first of all, they will only attempt to save themselves and secondly, there will be no ark in any case.  Well like I said, it's not realistic.  If you like fun and sci-fi, I guess this movie is for you.

  This movie is too fantastic and corn-fed of CGI-effects to be believable, but if you ever wondered, ""what if this were to happen"", it would be in this film.

In the cast: John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Thandie Newton, Oliver Platt, Danny Glover, Woody Harrelson, John Billingsley, George Segal, Stephen McHattie.

  In real-life:
  Will a major earthquake break off California into the ocean? NO!

  Will the Yellowstone Super Volcano Caldera in Wyoming erupt in our lifetime? NO! Probability is ""Low"".
  It's still bubbling. They do have earthquakes. The geysers have erupted and do change themselves. A large area northeast of Yellowstone Lake has uplifted again. The caldera is being watched and monitored everyday, but don't expect it to erupt like an atomic bomb in our lifetime. It is very safe to visit Yellowstone Park.

  Will Hawaii be overcome by a volcano and lava flows?  Not all of Hawaii. Only The Big Island has currently 3 ""active"" volcanoes. East rift eruptions caused fumes and lava flow south of Pu'u Honua'ula in 1955. Kapoho in Kilauea last erupted in 1960. Manua Loa erupted in 1984. Halema'uma'u erupted in March 2008. The Big Island will not be completely devastated, but will continue to grow.

  Will Washington DC have a major 9.4 earthquake and become like the South Pole? Never.
 (Update: Washington D.C. did have an earthquake, August 23, 2011. It was a 5.8 and originated from Virginia, felt as far as New York. The Washington Monument suffered damage and has been closed to the public ever since.

Will the Vatican City be destroyed?  Never. However, their is a prediction widely known that has been deciphered as the second Pope after Pope John Paul II would see the destruction of Rome. The next Pope after Pope Benedict XVI would be known as ""Peter The Roman"".
 Update: Pope Benedict XVI abdicated his position and Jorge Mario Bergoglio was elected March 13, 2013. He chose the name ""Pope Francis"".  The prediction did not happen, but will the next Pope be ""Peter the Roman""? We shall see about this one.

Will a giant tsunami flow over the mountains like an ocean?  Never! That's all Hollywood stuff.

 In real-life, we all saw what happened after an earthquake hit Indonesia on July 16, 2006 and a 5 meter tsunami came into the Island of Java.
  Offshore, Puako, Hawaii had a 6.7 earthquake on October 15, 2006. Only a 4 inch tsunami hit the Big Island.
  On February 27, 2010, off coast of the Mauke Region, Chile had an 8.8 earthquake.
  March 11, 2010, Pichilmu had a 6.9 earthquake. No tsunami.

 (Update:  March 11, 2011, The Greatest East Japan Earthquake was a 9.0, a mega-thrust off the Pacific Coast of Tohoku. A giant tsumami did hit the coast of Japan causing more death and further destruction.

What will really happen in 2012?
  We will have our usual earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, snow blizzards, volcanoes and floods. If you live in an area of the United States where none of these things occur, then you are safe.

  All this made up hyped world destruction on 2012 according to the end of the Mayan calendar is just baloney.
  They said the same thing about engravings and stones of the Great Pyramid. It never happened.

3734755,4,B001OQCV2E,"""2012."" Hmmmmm. The Mayans predicted a cataclysmic end to the Earth in 2012 and so it happens. As literary critic, Samuel Taylor Coleridge coined a consequently oft-used phrase concerning a work of fiction. Is it so constructed and made plausible that a reader is willing to suspend disbelief of any extraordinary elements? For this work of fiction/film, I could not, even though John Cusack, who usually lends credence to a celluloid story, is the lead actor. ""2012"" is not even close to that suspension, much less a ""willing"" suspension!

Early on I found myself saying, ""Yeah, right,"" over and over, as one incredible--NOT credible--thing after another happened! If the director had allowed Cusack and his family to escape one, two, even three huge disasters, I could have suspended. I might note that I am an easy suspender of disbelief if the director gives me something to work with. But here, Cusack and family miss all disasters, one after another. They miss crashing multiple times, miss falling into abysses multiple times, miss being burned up multiple times, and so on, until the viewer just accepts that disbelief is not the issue here-- the end of the world is. That's where the director succeeds in building concern for this family and willingness to accept that this is the end of the world, after all, and rules don't apply. Besides, I wanted to know how the story ends.

I also have a problem with the ending, but first here are various other aspects I find troubling:

1. Cusack seems to be the only person who can outrun catacylsmic earthquakes, boiling, roiling fires, exploding roadways and bridges, and falling buildings. Why Cusack? Why this family? The only apparent answer is that he wrote this book about Atlantis (I was in the kitchen when this part was shown so I'm not sure I have it exactly right), as if this book foreshadows the earth's end.

2. The earth ends and there's no mention of God? Mayans accurately predict the end? The Bible makes it clear that no one knows the day or the hour. Actually, self-reliant humanists should love this part!

3. Danny Glover as President of the United States? He has played so many villains as of late that I expected his every next word to reveal a villainous president!

4. A certain family member is eliminated--well, that's all I can say about this one to avoid spoilers, but trust me on this one--it's just too convenient.

5. Only the best of the best are picked to be ""saved."" Thomas Jefferson might approve of that plan, but my friend GB would have an apoplectic stroke!

5. The ending is both troubling and totally surprising, a plus. I cannot say more to avoid spoilers.

""2012"" is almost totally unbelievable, yet I enjoyed it. I had to know the end and was pleasantly surprised that this ending is actually believable!",1270684800,2,2802,4.7727272727272725

Being based on the predicted natural disasters that appear to be happening now and supposed to crescendo to a world wide chaotic conclusion in 2012, this movie avoids the prophecies and religious ideologies attached to the date by many people.  It is strictly adventure - one man trying to save his family from what seems to be inescapable doom - that drags you along to the awesome conclusion.

The computer graphics are out of this world.  The characters are portrayed as real humans and not super heros.  While some of the actions scenes stretch the limits of credibility, by the time you are watching them, you don't reallly care.  All you want to do is see the family reach safety.

I can't even begin spelling out all the problems with this movie. Bad script? Check! Bad acting? Check! Predictable? Check! Way to long? Check! Two dimensional characters? Check! Silly situations? Check! Overblown CGI? Check! Cartoonish destruction? Check!

This review would be 30 pages long if I started to take this movie apart. But my biggest problem is the science. I know, this IS a sci-fi, disaster movie. I know they had to make something up to make the end of the world seem possible; I have no problem with that. My problem is that it seems to me that Roland Emmerich just took a 6th grade science textbook and threw it out the window, I mean, there's stuff in here that would make a 10 year old shake his head.

My favorite example: John Cusack's character is in a car, on an airplane, flying 40,000 feet above the middle of nowhere over the Pacific Ocean, and is playing with the car radio trying to find a station. He turns to his wife and says: ""There's nothing. Not even an emergency signal!"". WELL OF COURSE! YOU'RE IN A PLANE OVER THE OCEAN! HELLO?

To enjoy this movie, you have to know nothing about how anything in this world works, from the government, to airplanes, to even radios. My biggest problem is that these little things don't let me believe the movie. Nothing in it is plausible. I loved Star Wars because the characters and situations seemed believable, and that movie stretches science even farther than this one. But I can believe it.

I can't do the same for this movie. It just seems to me that humans can never act the way they do in this movie. Or airplanes. Or radios. This movie is a fraud. I want my money back.",1270512000,35,1668,4.491749174917492

Not to give anything or too much away, but connecting the dots through a fantastical storyline just to keep a cast together should be illegal in the movie industry.  Sorry, but you shouldn't be able to make a movie unless the writing actually is both believable and is honest.  Instead we're lead to believe that a sequence of events are happening just because.  ACK!

The acting in my opinion was at least on par with the cast that was present and the other star was for, albeit ridiculous to the story, the special effects which were amazing.

Pretty much this movie is no more than a ride at Universal Studios, and the action does keep moving things along quite well, so if that's what you're looking for then this movie isn't so bad.

3734850,4,B001OQCV2E,"Ensconced somewhere, Roland Emmerich is cackling and wringing his hands, awaiting doomsday. In some hidden underground lair of his, the man has probably constructed the ultimate bomb shelter or at the very least is assembling his own Noah's ark. He may even be working off Irwin Allen's blueprints. This is how I like to think the mind of Roland Emmerich works. 2012 is the latest from this master of disaster and it's his biggest try yet. Emmerich has stated that 2012 would be his final disaster picture and if it is, this one is gonna be hard to top.

The best-laid schemes of mice and man again get diddled. A long time ago the Mayan calendar predicted the end of the world. It's 2012 now, and the signs are there. An alignment of planets, a phenomenon which happens only every 640,000 years, is causing massive solar flares to boil up the earth's core. Temperatures are rising, the earth's crust is destabilizing. In California, more now than ever, tremors have become a habit. Crazies crowd the street corner, waving their crayoned cardboard signs, heralding the Apocalypse. Back in 2009, the imminent global calamity is discovered and a massive, unprecedented, and very top secret international endeavor is launched.

In 2012 struggling author and divorced deadbeat dad Jackson Curtis (Cusack) gets the gift of being in the right place at the right time. On a camping trip with his children, he unearths a conspiracy and gets a whiff of how he can save himself and his loved ones. More involved in the secret project to preserve humanity is the geologist Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) and as the end of the world looms closer, Adrian finds his idealism trumped by the horrible realities of life. Although, the story follows a diverse cast, Curtis and Helmsley are the core characters.

Word to the wise: If you're making a disaster epic, make sure the special effects pop out and the cast is solid, because the f/x will have to carry the day but it has to be anchored by characters that you'll care enough about. I heard the budget ran around the 200 million mark so the CG stuff is truly rendered on an overwhelming scale. And while their character arcs aren't so original, Cusack's everyman appeal, Ejiofor's sincerity, Oliver Platt's smug Chief of Staff - and, by the way, Platt and Ejiofor engage in some pretty incendiary scene-chewing -  Woody Harrelson's terrific looney tunes doomsaying DJ, and Zlatko Buric's Russian billionaire... these cats are glue enough to keep you emotionally invested. Also, that seven-year-old girl with the pull-ups and the hat fixation is adorable. 2012 covers the usual bases of the genre: fractured families, a soap opera, a morality play, the end of the world.

Scoff or cave in. You'll have to do one or the other. There are only so many scenes of hairbreadth escapes, of our cast outrunning earthquakes and crushing waves of water, fireballs and other hurtling objects that you can take in before you either get enough of the nonsense or submit to Emmerich's fantastical whims. Me, I rolled with all the crazy stuff and the cheesy stuff. What is 2012 if you can't suspend disbelief? Although, at an elephantine running time of 2 hours and 38 minutes, that's a lot of suspension.

I can see audiences in other countries checking this film out if only to see how the toppling of their famous landmarks are handled. The CG is bombastic and absolutely stunning and treats us to a breathtaking film-long chain of mammoth scenes in which monuments and landscapes are absolutely obliterated. The destructive sh-- that goes down is exactly what big screens are made for. 2012 is a spectacle and, really, there's nowhere else for Emmerich to go if he were to make another disaster film. There are no more kitchen sinks.

In the Grain of Salt Department, I have a few nitpicks about Cusack's character, and these are really the only concerns which took me out of the movie. The first is at the Yellowstone National Park where Jackson Curtis disregards the warning signs posted on a fence and opts to scale the fence with his children, even with one of the kids remarking dubiously: ""Don't you see the signs?"" The other is an even more blatant case of reckless endangerment as Jackson takes his young daughter along on a whirlwind search for the crazy DJ, Charlie Frost. The last thing is actually Jackson being a good dad and it happens near the end. Time very much a factor and tapped with playing hero, Jackson got on my nerve as he took his sweet time hugging it out with the fam and dispensing pep talks, and I know, I know, you can't blame Jackson Curtis for that... but I guess actors will milk the moment.

The DVD Special Features include: Writer/Director Roland Emmerich and Co-Writer Harald Kloser record their Teutonic musings on an audio commentary track; an alternate, perhaps too optimistic ending; five deleted scenes (including one in which Helmsley finally loses his cool and pops Anheuser); a feature on ""Roland Emmerich: The Master of the Modern Epic""; and ""Time for Miracles"" - Adam Lambert's music video.

Two final things: I know it's silly but I kept expecting Danny Glover - who plays the last President of the United States - to somewhere in the story grouse that he's ""too old for this sh--!"" Also, Roland Emmerich seems to find Wisconsin amusing. It's kinda weird.",1270252800,,5334,4.808069792802617

I'm a tech freak so I could really appreciate the special effects. I can't get enough of seeing LA and NYC getting destroyed.  However,  even for me that couldn't really offset the lack of plot.  The main characters were simply running away from impending doom (always just one step ahead).  The plot was too much like Day After Tomorrow, War of the Worlds, or Cloverfield, i.e., thin.

WHO CARES? The world is going to end and none of it matters. I wonder if anyone in the writing team ever thought of that.

I certain'y didn't care about any of the characters. They were ALL boring, trite, and I cringed every time the film focused on the meaningless details of their lives that obviously added no value to the movie or character development. I mean the movie could have chosen ANYONE to focus its story but they just happens to be the most boring dysfunctional family you would ever want to know.

The special effects, however, were spectacular.

The movie was 20 minutes too long. I just didn't care about this movie after 2 hours. I just wanted to see the end and how the humanity would survive.

I knew from the second I walked in on the movie, around a half hour in, that it was utter garbage. Not one of the main characters dared to rise above the cardboard stereotype that they initially appeared to be. Misunderstood father. Ex-wife who still loves him but is pretending she doesn't for some reason. Bratty kid #1. Bratty kid #2. Ex-wife's new boyfriend. Meek genius guy no one listens to, who finally dares to stand up to the wrongheaded establishment. Wacky crazy guy with long hair that knew it all the time. Self-sacrificing President who gives stirring speech on TV. Noble Russian guy. Etc, etc, etc. You've seen these characters done many times before, and everything they do plays out exactly like you'd expect. The characters you expect to die, die. The characters you expect to live and become romantically connected, yep. They do just that. UGH!

As for the special effects... meh. Just meh. It's like watching someone else play a video game. They're dodging falling buildings in a plane, and jumping over huge cracks in the earth, and I just kept thinking, hand me the controller, I want to try that. And then, I was thinking, how do I skip this boring cutscene?

The problem with 2012 is that it tries to pretend to be something it's clearly not: a character-driven, thought provoking film. The movie would have worked just as well if they would have removed all the dialogue and just had 2 hours of the world being destroyed. In fact, I think it would have worked better, because unlike the actors, I think the audience could muster some awe at the events taking place if we didn't have to listen to inane banter between Jon Cusack and Amanda Peet after they literally just escaped certain death for the fifth time in an hour.

There's nothing to recommend this movie. It can't be taken seriously, but it's not funny enough to even warrant a chuckle. Just stay away. If you end up with a copy, use it to prop up a table leg or something.",1270166400,9,2157,4.551546391752577

3734944,1,B001OQCV2E,"There have been a few comments in reviews about this movie being a simple popcorn flick and how, should you detach your brain for 3 hours you will manage to enjoy this monstrosity. Simply, that is not true, unless you're actually willing to run the risk of you being made more of an idiot by watching this movie and thinking ""hmm, that was an enjoyable romp"". Perhaps I did look too much into this movie and wanted it to have a good storyline that would at least captivate me without having to look at bizarre shiny things every 10 minutes to remind me of what movie I'm watching. I am even one of those guys who will be quite willing to poke a hole in his skull and flick that switch that says ""you don't need me to enjoy this"" but I really couldn't enjoy this piece of detritus left over from the imagination of the crazy person that brought us ""The Day After Tomorrow"". Even my rotting, mindless corpse struggled to find the enjoyment in this as every minute left me feeling more and more insulted by the garbage that was being spewed from the screen. The special effects guy, the man that seems to have worked so hard making the image of thousands of human lives appear disposable at the click of a mouse, in favour of a group of equally pointless human beings who had so many close shaves in this movie, it would make George Clooney wish he had a better razor, deserves applause as he has done a fantastic job.

So the story begins with our unlikely hero, John Cusack, a pathetic limo driver who just wants to be as good a Dad as possible for his kids while his ex-wife and her new piece of meat get on with their lives. Now, more than ever, Daddy gets the chance to prove his worth by saving his kids, the ex and her man from the end of the world through awesome driving skills and lying to the kids that everything is going to be ok. On the other side of this story is a budding geologist, Chiwetel Ejiofor who discovers that because of that crazy thing called the Sun and the cool sounding Neutrino's the centre of our Earth is melting and there's F*** all we can do about it but hope to become ridiculously rich and buy our survival. You may be wondering how exactly John Cusack managed to survive this craziness; well it's pretty cool actually as clichd crazy person, Woody Harrelson who's spouting the typical conspiracy ""our government's hiding it from us"" jolliness manages to get it right and because he manages to predict events correctly, Cusack decides that this crazy person is the key to survival.

OK, there's a bit more to it than that. Actually there isn't, Danny Glover is president which is pretty cool and it takes on the typical of these types of garbage movies which is that humans aren't very nice people when it comes to surviving unless you're related in some genetic form. Then, if you're not related genetically, the amount of money you have matters the most. Ah Capitalism, how you make the world a better place. Wait, sorry I was making the film sound a bit more intelligent than it actually is for a second there. In fact, it's the most idiotic film imaginable. So much so, that the marketers capitalised on the idiocy of some people by creating a viral marketing campaign that made this whole thing seem real and that we were all really F***ed by December 21st 2012. I'll give it credit, the special effects are amazing, but the Roland Emmerich films are terrifying in a more deep seeded way as he's not just a guy who makes crappy big budget epics, but he's a man that makes movie that have the human race appear absolutely worthless and any depiction of mass slaughter on a scale such as this is to simply be labelled cool and nothing more. I'm sure I'm thinking too much into it, but this film insulted every facet of my intelligence.

The acting, as could be expected was terrible. The amount of close calls our ""heroes"" had was terrible. Everything about this movie, aside from the chilling special effects was terrible. The shocking thing is that Emmerich's movies continue to make a profit time and time again thus meaning this man gets the opportunity to make more and more of this drivel.

3734947,1,B001OQCV2E,"Only Hollywood and Roland Emmerich could put together something more ridiculous. This movie plays out with so many eyerolls and over-the-top ridiculousness that it was almost like Emmerich was making fun of the people who've allowed him to make high dollar bomb after high dollar bomb by going to his films like drones, continuously tricked by promotional campaigns and slam bam trailers. Puppets we are. Well, not me.

The only reason I rented this, and I nearly cryed to take my last remaining $3 out of my wallet in order to do so, was because I'm a fan of Amanda Peet. I think she's charming as heck and I could watch her read the newspaper. Yet, she's sort of wasted here with nothing to do but raise her eyebrow every three minutes because something else ridiculous is happening outside their chosen vehicle.

If you like your action movies ridiculous and unrealistic, then 2012 is for you. I don't. If you like to have your intelligence insulted with the excuse of, ""Oh, it's just supposed to be fun."" then 2012 is for you.

The movie is based on the fact that the Mayan calendar runs out in December, the year 2012. Fortelling a true fact, verified by many scientists that for an unknown amount of time, the galaxies rotation will leave us without the sun's power.

So, Roland Emmerich, being the person he is, chose to do what he does best. Take hollywood and your money and imagine the most unfeasible special effect and catastrophic collapes and crumblings of national monuments that you could imagine and put them together in one 2 hour film with no story except... run... everything's falling apart. Get somewhere!

There is no story, so here are some examples of ridiculousness: John Cusak's character Jackson Curtis, a writer, missed his calling. He should have been a stunt driver or Nascar stud because he drives, not a Porsche 911, but a stretch limo through some of the most ridiculous situations you can imagine. Including jumping a major break in the road. He also jumps a break in the road and crashes through the window of a building that has fallen over the road and of course drives through it and out the other side. Later in the movie, he does some driving magic with a WINNEBAGO. Somehow, he jumps a void created by an earthquake on a airplane runway.

Then they fly an airplane beneath buildings crumblings and watch a subway train fly over their heads. There's a volcano that erupts and they drive the WINNEBAGO just out of reach of the lava as it spreads across the countryside... of course leading up to the most ridiculous car jump since... no, it's the most ridiculous car jump ever.

Bottom line: Roland Emmerich once again suckers everyone out of their money and once again guarantees that he'll get another big budget funding for 2011. Thank god, the worlds ending in 2012 so, FINALLY, in 2013, we won't have to give up one of our precious summer movie slots to another Emmerich eye roller.",1270080000,2,2927,4.682879377431907
3734948,1,B001OQCV2E,"If I could've given this waste of time negative stars, I would've given it about a negative 10. This film is unbelievable from start to finish (Mythbusters could do about 5 shows on it), unscientific (they just make stuff up as they go along) and beyond ridiculous (the scene with the Arks is beyond words). Some disaster movies are enjoyable to watch, not because of believability, but for entertainment value. This is not one of those movies. I actually found myself cheering for the disasters to kill off the main characters so the real horrors would end, but it was not to be. If only the bridge would've fallen faster, or the earth could've opened wider, or if the ice was harder, but no such luck for us the tortured viewer. It's supposed to be based on the belief of the Mayan calendar and that the world will end on Dec. 31st, 2012, which in itself is up for debate, but I'd rather hear that than have to sit through a second of this abomination to film.

If there was a ""movie"" to skip watching for all of eternity, this would be it. All of the fancy, special CGI gimmicks in the world can't make a movie this horrible watchable.

The trailers made it look like it was going to be...possibly hokey, but I heard great things about it.  It's directed by Roland Emmerich, who has never helmed a boring movie yet, but at the same time they usually have some intangible weakness that keep them from coming together and reaching their full potential (at least in my opinion).&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Day-After-Tomorrow-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JMXX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Day After Tomorrow (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;was visually fantastic and had a few good angles in there, but the story felt overly contrived and didn't gel for me.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Independence-Day/dp/B00008G8M4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Independence Day</a>&nbsp;and Emmerich's version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godzilla/dp/0767817478/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godzilla</a>&nbsp;both started off awesome.  The first twenty minutes or so of Godzilla made it look like it was going to be a dynamite movie, and the first 45 minutes or so of Independance Day was incredible, but both movies started steeply downhill shortly thereafter.  Now, all these were worth seeing, but...  As for 2012, imagine the opening parts of movies like Independance Day that look so promising, and then imagine that it never goes downhill, but lives up to its full potential.  2012 did that.  Emmerich pulled all the elements together and delivered the film of his career, and one of the best big-budget disaster epics ever.

  Based loosely on the fact that the ancient Mayan civilization's highly detailed and accurate calendar ends abruptly in the year 2012, a point that some have interpreted as a prophecy of some dire event in that year, the movie 2012 opens with everyday research into solar activity coming up with some sharply disturbing data.  The amount of neutrinos - tiny subatomic particles emitted by stars - that are coming out of our Sun is escalating sharply.  Neutrinos are so small that the vast majority of them pass through an object even as large as the Earth without connecting with anything: they just slip right through the gaps between atoms and molecules.  However, a very small amount of them do bump into an atom here or there, but the effect on anything larger than the sub-microscopic scale is infintessimal.  2012 posits that with a huge surge in the number of neutrinos and hence the number of neutrino impacts, the results could be unpredictable and bad.  In the movie, the result that's already begun from this increase is that the inner Earth is starting to heat up - quickly.  This information is brought to the world's leaders, who keep it secret but actually start taking actions immediately.

  Fast forward to the year 2012 and the heating of the inner Earth is escalating far faster than the scientists predicted in their gravest calculations, and it appears Doomsday may be imminent.  When disaster begins hitting, it is indeed what it looked like in the trailers - every conceivable disaster movie angle from floods to earthquakes to volcanoes and beyond - all breaking loose at once.  But they've actually gone and worked out a single root cause to tie it all together, which is a big plus.  There's a wide cast of characters, including the scientists who originally discovered the internal heating, a novelist (John Cusack) who wrote a disaster novel whose events parralell many of the happenings and who stumbles into the main flow of things, his family, including his ex-wife (Amanda Peet) and their children as well as the ex-wife's new beau (in a nice change from stereotype, neither the 'ex-husband' or the 'new guy' gets cast in the 'jerk' role, and the two actually work together well as the group attempts to find safety amidst the chaos), the American president and his daughter, a Russian billionaire and his entourage, and so on.  Basically - a wide, diverse group.  The characters are actually interesting and, for the most part, likable.  The good guys aren't necesarily perfect, and the shady characters generally aren't without some redeeming value.  So you've got a large group of people you really care what happens to.  Throw in the fact that the moments of wit and humor really work this time out instead of falling flat like they sometimes do in big action epics; plus crust displacement theory and references to the fact that the Earth's poles actually have switched positions over the eons; plus awesome visual effects; and even some inspirational themes that don't come off as forced, and you've got one powerful epic.

  Critics will point out that 2012 isn't necesarily the most realistic movie ever made, but it's not so glaringly Un-realistic as to be a pain.  Actually more believable than I thought it would be, and a few sequences that might be a tad 'over-amped' or excessively optimistic can be justified in a blast of a movie like this.  And any excess can also be cleared away by the unexpectedly strong message of the movie that in a catacylsm like this, maybe it would actually bring out the best in the world instead of an instant turn to global barbarism.  2012 is recommended for all, but especially for fans of disaster movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deep-Impact-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0002V7OI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deep Impact (Special Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dante-s-Peak/dp/0783225547/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dante's Peak</a>, or of Emmerich's previous movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stargate-Ultimate-Edition/dp/B0000844I8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stargate (Ultimate Edition)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-000-B-C/dp/B0012Q732O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10,000 B.C.</a>&nbsp;(his two best before prior to this one, in my opinion).",1269993600,4,6195,5.948139797068771

3734974,3,B001OQCV2E,"There are some movies that must, that demand to be seen in the theater.  g2012 is one of those movies.  If you like action, and I mean a lot of action then this is a movie that you will want to take a non-stop, hold on to your armrests look at.  John Cusack is one of my favorite actors.  They guy can flat out make you believe he is whatever happens to be called upon in whatever scene he is playing out.  I canft remember him ever doing a big budget flat out action packed thriller before but he continues his impressive run at being a mainstream A player in Hollywood.

The movie as with most gdisaster moviesh has the world ending as we know it.  The issue is discovered in 2009 with earth predicted to hit global destruction a few years into the future.  As with most scientific discoveries it takes the government a while to read and decipher the data but once they do they make a pack with as many countries as possible to prepare for the impending doom.  In a realistic framework, the presiding officials sell off seats to the highest bidders and then use the money to fund the massive project.  China builds the ships as it is the only country that can employ its citizens for slave labor without drawing attention.  The subtle political tones of the movie are interesting if you look at them.

John Cusack plays a struggling writer who has managed to sell a few hundred copies of some books (I can relate to this one personally) and drives a limousine as his day job.  He is divorced and his wifefs new husband drives a Porsche.  Damn, those new husbands always have money donft they.  Through a series of random events he finds himself in the middle of figuring out what is going on and attempts to get his family to the safety zone reserved for the rich elite.  I can only say it is a good thing that luck was on his side because the dude almost bit the bullet about 1,000 times in the span of over two hours.

The visual graphics were amazing.  Buildings toppling with the people inside free falling through the structure and out the side.  Bridges collapsing and boats toppling.  You find your eyes constantly drawn to the details as you focus on a poor sap that didnft make the main billing as he gets squashed by some large structure.  It is one thing to focus on a disaster movie; it is a completely different aspect when you see the details of what that disaster is causing.  It somehow makes it personal while at the same time cataclysmic.

With the limited time to build the path to safety there are only a select few who will make it to the new world alive.  This is where you touch on some of the personal stories and it allows the actors a little freedom to convey their talent.  Just so we are clear, the acting is fine in the movie but the movie is not about acting.  The script is smart and well done, action is first rate, the visual effects are Oscar worthy and the overall production and editing were nicely pulled together.

3734976,3,B001OQCV2E,"2012 is an odd film.  It can be viewed on a number of levels: it brings to the public eye the old Mayan prediction that the earth and civilization as we know it will be destroyed on December 21, 2012, it is an exercise in computer generated graphics in the hands of Roland Emmerich, it poses a few questions as to what is important in life and how learning what is important is learning how to live in the now, and it is a roller coaster corny simplistic mess of a plot that sells out at every chance it gets to make a meaningful statement.

The cast, watching the crumbling and burning of the planet, is huge. John Cusack is a satisfying hero/returned dad, Chiwetel Ejiofor represents the good in science, Oliver Platt propels the action with his usual ability to steal a scene, Woody Harelson is, well, Woody Harelson as dopey as ever, Thandie Newton and Amanda Peet add the appropriate glamour and love interests, Danny Glover makes a fine President of the USA, Johann Urb is a very screen-powerful presence as a Russian pilot, and Osric Chau makes a very positive impression as a personality the camera loves and a character with whom we can identify (he needs some important roles to allow us to further examine his potential).  And there are others equally as well cast.

What will bother those who find a degree of credence and associated anxiety with the Mayan prediction will be sorry to see the silly manner in which 400,000 of mankind and animalkind are saved in boats to land in Africa to restart civilization.  But then this is Hollywood and Roland Emmerich tends to concentrate more on CGI than on content.  It is long, but then it is entertaining - to a point.

3734978,3,B001OQCV2E,"There are moments, in Roland Emmerich's latest ""The World Is Toast"" epic, ""2012"", when I actually thought he had put together a pretty nifty 'End of the World' fable. True, he had taken the concept straight from the overused Mayan Calendar hype, and much of the plot from Philip Wylie and Edwin Balmer's 1933 classic SF novel, ""When Worlds Collide"" (if I were one of the authors' heirs, I'd call a good lawyer!), but I was impressed that, for once, Emmerich's usual collection of blue-collar heroes couldn't come up with an easy 'fix' to solve things. Between the radiation, earthquakes, volcanoes, tidal waves, and other mayhem, things get pretty awful on a biblical scale, with incredible FX of the destruction of major cities and landmarks, and I admit it, I was impressed!

But then Emmerich's knack for sugar-coating and superficial 'fixes' kicked in, and ""2012"" stumbled back from the abyss, into Disney Channel 'cuteness'...the 'arks' are a variation 'lifted' from the fleet of spacecraft from ""When Worlds Collide"", but with a design flaw so obvious that even a gerbil could figure it out; enough ash and radiation is pumped into the atmosphere that a generation-long nuclear winter would be a 'given', yet our surviving heroes are partying outside, in what, a year??? And Africa survives, nearly intact???? You can imagine how thrilled the Africans are going to be to see seven arks filled with European, Asian, and American politicians and bureaucrats pulling up, ready to take over!

So, ultimately, ""2012"" is a disappointment...but I consider it a far more enjoyable film than ""Independence Day"", and you may, as I did, get caught up in the grandeur of the destruction, for at least a while. John Cusack and Woody Harrelson are both quite funny, and if I would have to go, I think Harrelson's choice of demise isn't a bad finale for a sixties' rocker!",1269820800,2,1863,4.929936305732484

Then at the end, we have 2 or 3 arks or whatever (I lost interest by that time) built high up in the Himalayas or wherever by the Chinese.

""In time, the Rockies may crumble

But our love is here to stay.""

essentially sum up the film, except you get to see something similar to the first two lines happen in real time.

3734997,1,B001OQCV2E,"Oh my word, this movie was AWFUL! Apparently, cliches strung together in a hapless mess are supposed to pass for a script nowadays.

Some of the cast really, really tried to act, bless them, but they simply couldn't fight back against a script this awful. And some of the choices of who acted what roles...I mean, would anyone elect a softly spoken gentle man you can barely hear as president? Should a comedic actor who can't do drama really be a dramatic lead? And should all the characters and most of the plot ideas be ripped off from other movies, even movies like Snakes On A Plane?

The timing was out...I mean, for instance, in the middle of an action sequence, where the hero has mere seconds to save the future of humanity, does he really have time to give his kid a long and wordy chat full of values and endearments? And as per usual in too many fantasy/sci fi movies, many of the characters had 'father issues'. Worst of all, two of the characters' fathers were killed, yet within minutes they are flirting and chatting happily. What the...? Sometimes this movie had 'after-school special' written all over it, it was so lame and cheesy, yet other times, it was so inappropriate I could barf. And as for the choices of who gets killed off...I mean, you could see it coming, and to avoid giving spoilers, I'll just list it as foreigners and people who didn't fit the conventional family unit.

Most of the plotting was so unbelievable I laughed out loud at its ridiculousness. The laws of physics, gravity, inertia and sensibility were all completely ignored. And why oh why, in the flying scenes, couldn't the pilots just have banked the plane UPWARDS instead of flying on and on at low altitudes through a painfully endless stream of falling debris, which for some reason all fell in slow motion, slower than the plane could fly, or slower than a car could drive or a man could run for that matter.

BTW, as I watched the movie, I began to suspect that it was being written by two writers, and that they were practising 'self insertion', living vicariously through two of the male lead characters. I mean, one of the characters is always right and gets the hot girl in the end. The other character is a writer who gets constant praise for his writing, even though he doesn't seem to me to be much good, and who ends up saving the day. These two characters are not realistic, they're more like mere characatures of who two rather mediocre writers might possibly want to be, if they could become heroes. I'm not sure if my belief is right, but I did note at the end of the movie that it had two writers.

The reason I gave this film five stars is because of the action and the FX.  From almost the beginning of the film, I was on a roller coaster ride of adrenaline, going from one great scene of devastation to another.  Ooh - there goes a whole chunk of California, sliding into the Pacific.  Just watch the little cars go over the edge!  Old Faithful and all the other Faithfuls let loose in a tremendous volcanic eruption.  Huge tsunamis drag little people from the arms of their tiny loved ones.  In the midst of all this, the fabulous actor John Cusack, relying heavily on the the open-gaped and wide-eyed facial expression, emotes frantically as he barely escapes one potential disaster after another.  The scene where he drives through LA while buildings topple is worth rewinding and watching again and again.  To all you naysayers who say P.U. to the plot of the film, just enjoy the mayhem.

Well, Emmerich and his team of writers took dumb to the dumber level with 2012. Gotta at least give him a C for consistency I guess.

2012 was stupid right from the starting gun: from the highly unbelievable hiking trek by John Cusack's family into government restricted areas, to unrealistic aerial acrobatics by under-skilled pilots, to the eventual premise that ""someone"" would be somewhat prepared for this kind of disaster but only save politicians and royalty.

Oh don't worry, none the above will spoil the movie for you; it'll do that all by itself.

------------------
This is a silly romp of a disaster thriller, a goofy-on-purpose homage to any number of 1970s-era disaster flicks (""Poseidon Adventure,"" ""Towering Inferno,"" et al) with plenty of nods to other films as well (""The Ten Commandments,"" ""Close Encounters,"" ""Independence Day,"" TV's ""10.3""  and many, many more...) The filmmakers only briefly make any pretense that this is a serious film, but once Woody Harrelson's wacko pirate-radio conspiracy theorist character shows up to babble about the end of the world, the mood shifts into pure camp: a man tells his lover, ""I feel like something's come between us,"" and an earthquake opens a giant chasm between them... Ten minutes later, Los Angeles is sinking into the sea, with numerous LA in-jokes along the way. If you're looking for a white-knuckle, nail-biting action film, this certainly has spectacular special effects galore and a strong ""how-can-we-top-THAT-one?"" sensibility. There isn't much suspense -- you know things are going to get blown up, and that the effects are going to get bigger and bigger... But what it lacks in surprise, the film makes up in self-referential, over-the-top comedy. Some of it (Woody Harrelson) falls flat, but mostly this is a movie that works just fine i you take it on its own terms, as an action-flick parody, rather than as a straight-up action movie.

Unfortunately, it was boring, predictable, the actors were really bad and the special effects looked as if they were made 15 years ago. When the ground is initially separating behind somebody running, then behind a car driving, then behind a plane taking off, this is seriously getting old. Some special effects were great, the vast majority so bad though that you immediately thought about the green room these scenes were taken in. Planes that after takeoff do not gain altitude, but drop a few thousand feets, then fly maneuvers that physically would not be possible, the scale of the model used does not match the environment and so on ...

3735031,5,B001OQCV2E,"2012: 8 out of 10: I love disaster movies. I love 'good' disaster movies such as The Towering Inferno and The Poseidon Adventure. I love 'bad' disaster movies such as The Swarm and Independence Day. I even enjoy, if not love, 'Horrible' disaster movies such as Syfy channel stalwarts Megafault and Magma: Volcanic Disaster.

2012 is solidly in the 'good' disaster movie genre. As I have stated before in my The Core review 'Disaster movies always seem to do better when the disaster is local in scope. A city threatened by avalanche, a tower threatened by an inferno, a Poseidon threatened by an adventure, that kind of thing. Earth killer movies are always a harder road.'

2012 dodges this bullet slightly by having neutrinos from a massive solar flare penetrate the Earth and cause the temperature of the core to increase rapidly. 'Like a microwave' one scientist very helpfully explains. Of course why these same neutrinos don't cause the oceans to boil is a plot hole that the movie delightfully ignores. Still compared to The Core or The Day after Tomorrow, 2012's science is practically textbook.

Now since the core is expanding this causes the earth's crust to erupt in different directions (think a Jiffy Pop container). This allows disaster footage from all over the earth. And we all know where disasters strike first. That's right monuments. Vegas, Washington DC, Vatican City, Los Angeles, Yellowstone, Hawaii, and others get there turn in the special effects blender. The set pieces are generally well thought out often with sly commentary attached. (A giant rolling donut in LA, A slick atheist 'Where is your God now' rub at the Vatican.). The special effects are all magnificent.

I will briefly talk about the actors in a minute (Generally speaking they all do fine) but the star is the effects. The detail work (as can be seen in the disaster porn pictures below) is simply amazing. Director Roland Emmerich puts his 250 million dollar budget on the screen. For once the buildings that collapse have people in them. The disasters do not happen in the rain or at night and the camera doesn't jerk around as if directed by an epileptic sugar glider.

The location work is creative as are the disasters. (Let's face it a tsunami driving an aircraft carrier into the White House is imagination at work.) In addition, the story is a fairly grounded version of that old When Worlds Collide plot where all the smart rich and good looking people get on a spaceship and escape Earth while all the less attractive people all die horribly.

The movie halfheartedly tries to address the unfairness of 'who gets chosen' but we really didn't come for a civics lesson and honestly there are worse ways to go than just picking attractive rich people. We also didn't come for the acting, but unlike many of its contemporaries, the acting in 2012 seems solid across the board.

Some of the various side plots fall a little flat (especially considering the two and a half hour length, the old guys on the boat subplot could have been jettisoned in its entirety.) On the plus side Zlatko Buric as the Russian billionaire ex-boxer and Woody Harrelson as the crazy mountain man (doing his best Matthew McConaughey impression mind you) are the stand outs.

Overall we came for the disaster porn and simply put 2012 delivers some of the best disaster porn ever seen on screen, and manages this feat with fewer of the bad acting and horrible storyline distractions that usually accompany such films. Bravo.",1269043200,,3501,4.842809364548495

This is just simply an absolute waste of movie film, digital film, or whatever the heck they are using these days to make cheesy flicks like this. Albeit, the special effects were decent but nothing you havn't already seen many times over in your typical disaster movie. On the other hand the acting was like something out of a 70's B movie, the plot was...wait a minute...there was no plot,and the storyline in general was nothing short of complete predictability. As if the non stop narrow death misses of the main characters were unbelievable enough the writer of this train wreck  apparently thought it amusing to have several moments of humorous quips from the characters while the world was falling down around them. Adding further suspension of disbelief, people in this film stop and talk about stupid personal issues during the most ridiculous moments as buildings are toppling all around them and the earth is virtually crumbling under their feet. By the way, did I mention that none of these characters are interesting or likable except for maybe Woody Harrelson as the amusing nut job conspiracy theorist. Poor ol Woody must have really needed the paycheck because this film will end up going down as one of the worst made on his resume. During the film  all I could do was wish and hope for everyone to DIE and die quickly to put me out of my misery from this maelstrom of over dramatic non-sense. Lastly, of course it's the MADE IN CHINA ship that provides the true safe haven for humanity. Gee, don't see any political double meaning with that?

Through familiarity and repetition, the listener/viewer is mesmerized to believe the story, because it is already embedded into the psyche.  ""2012"" is a contemporary version of Noah's Ark.  It's a dramatic, pseudo-scientific explanation to how the world, as we know it, will end.  Like any Hollywood morality tale, the fight is against saving all of humanity (including the dregs) versus the upper echelon that would create a  world based on genetic and economic specialization.

""2012"" is filled with altruism, special effects, and subliminal messages.  There's a part in the movie after the flood where John Cusack's daughter asks him when are they going back home.  His response was ""We're going to make a new home here.""  ""2012"" is the Terror Attacks of September 11, 2001 multiplied by a million and the sentiments are tantamount to a tree falling on a house and someone saying---""We're just call All State for an estimate.""  Obviously, we have to grant a certain amount of ""Dramatic License"" to imaginary events, but this movie asks us to suspend reality altogether.

This movie has artistic value in its cinematography, but the storyline is hackneyed and overly moralistic.

First of all, the script sucks. And the fact they put a black president in the film feels so forced, plus the guy - surprise! - decided to stay behind and allow himself to die. How heroic. Every aspect of the plot is either predictable, or plain laughable.

And then, the CG effects are just plain cheap-looking and almost crude at times. All those deaths, simulated with cold objectivity, make one wonder if the director cares about humanity himself, or maybe he's secretly rooting for mankind's demise, or at least that of everyone who's not important on this earth (that's you and me, pal).

The Explosions and destruction is fun to watch, even though you know in the back of your mind its rather nuts you are enjoying seeing the fictional death of 6 billion people.  Then the absolutely stupid last hour of the film starts to play, and the popcorn is getting cold and stale.  The soda is gone, and you squirm in your seat waiting for it to end.  They have a select group of people who manage to survive, just like Independence Day.  They even have fluffy the little dog, who fails to get crushed, burned, or drowned over and over... The end though is what killed the enjoyment for the movie.  The survivors are on their way to a new beginning - the politicians, mega rich, entertainers, etc. (basically all the winy, self absorbed jerks that you look upon with disgust from the daily front pages) are all saved and the planet is a smoking hulk, a ruin from one corner to the other.  They set out to start again with smiles and that winsome look you come to expect in these films.  I remember thinking in the theater with some pleasure about how they would land and find nothing to eat, no Starbucks, no 5 star restaurants...  And Buffy the mega model and Biffy the super politician would gasp and stare, wondering where all the mere peasants were that would have to hoe and plant and slave away to keep their upscale #$#es from starving to death...

We've all been through that--now imagine it as a movie and you've got this flick. It's for people who have a ""jones"" for video games and are loudly bored by anything less intense. I'm not going to go into the story line here because you can get as much from this film's ads as from watching the film itself. This example of a mugging in cinematic form isn't plot-driven or character-driven, it's completely scene-driven. It seems meant to overwhelm and impress really jaded viewers. I really think the only reason it got released was that it seizes on this new ""2012"" craze where too many doofuses are heavily into ""doomsday is coming"" scenario they got from the pagan Mayan calendar. The wierd thing is that after I sent the thing back, one of my roommates and I were in a mall that has a Bose Audio outlet and he wanted to see a demonstration of their biggest home theater setup.

""2012"" is just more of the same, capitalizing on the 2012 craze, and grossing over $750 million world-wide.  Most of the cast are worldview fellow travelers like Danny Glover and Woody Harrelson.  John Cusack gets top billing, but Chiwetel Ejiofor is the only one who warrants that treatment in this picture.

3735053,2,B001OQCV2E,"Wow, I just finished watching this film a few days ago, and I am utterly disappointed. It is really disappointing when I'm watching a film, and the entire time I'm imagining how I would approach the material to make a better film. When you find yourself doing that, then you know there's something wrong with what you're watching. Was it worth the view? Yes, only once. I must admit that I was impressed with most of the special effects, and that is the only reason I kept the movie rather than return it back to the store. Everything else, though, failed miserably for me. For one thing, some great actors delivered some of their poorest work here. John Cusack and Amanda Peet are usually very likable and talented actors, but in this film, their little daughter exceeded their acting skills, crying when it was appropriate to cry and feeling scared when it was appropriate to get scared. All we get from them is wide-eyed wonder when they see their home get destroyed. When the movie ended, a few things entered my mind to justify for the piece of crap I just saw. I began to tell myself that the filmmakers intended for the story to be so unrealistic so they wouldn't freak out half of our population. If a more dark and realistic picture would have been made, perhaps there would have been severe consequences. 2012 is a film not meant to be taken seriously. In fact, it made it seem so comical, that I doubt anyone will believe the end of the world is at hand any longer.

I will say, this movie is filled with flaws; it is, overall, crap. However, it does have some very impressive visuals that can be enhanced and fully appreciated on blu-ray, and it does have some intense scenes that, despite their absurdity, will get you involved. I suggest you see it before you buy it. I, personally do not regret buying it because I purchased it on blu-ray, and felt it really elevated the experience and made it worthwhile for me.

The earth's crust supposedly heats up and liquefies, which causes massive earthquakes and volcanoes and a shifting of the continents.  The movie attempts to bring some scientific logic to the disaster, but if you know anything about geology or physics, it falls flat.  The main characters are a family that escapes this disaster and manages to get themselves onto a big ship built by the Chinese to ferry humanity's survivors.

3735068,3,B001OQCV2E,"2012 is a movie where all the heroes escape by the thinnest of plots...I mean margins. It's the old fashioned disaster movie where a handful of actors dodge impossible odds and impending doom always seems to be just a wee bit slower than the plane/car/small dog racing in front of the collapsing ground/raging fireball/crushing metal machinery. It's B-Movie dumb with 21'st century technology. It will kill off 2 and a half hours of your afternoon and few brain cells in the process.

Director Roland Emmerich obviously learned a lesson from the wretchedly awful 10,000 BC (I joked that the BC then stood for Bad Cinema), where wafer thin plots better have a lot of things going ka-boom if the audience is going to plop down ticket money. So this time, at almost every turn, you get a gloriously apocalyptic shot of disaster. Be it the raining of molten fireballs on Jellystone park or the collapse of California into the Pacific, the effects are incredible. 2012 is the best disaster porn since ""Titanic,"" and you don't have to wade through all those stuffy period dress. For that matter, the emotional baggage of millions of people dying before your very eyes.

Really, if you had just watched a city of millions get washed off the globe, would you react with giggles and jokes? Because no-one here seems to be all that disturbed that major chunks of the populous have been wiped out. Hardly anyone seems to be capable of shedding tears, save for the President's daughter and the scientific superbrain. With the exception of John Cusak and Woody Harrelson, all the actors here are interchangeable, mere props set against the gloriously delicious mayhem that does keep you on the edge of your seat throughout 2012.

So ignore the implausibility of it all and the sarcastic 2012 political subtext (only politicians and the wealthy will be worth having around post-apocalypse), and thrill to the destruction of the White House by Tsunami bearing battleship.

- 1080p HD at 2.40:1
- 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio sound is available in English and French
- Subtitles in English and French

TECHNICAL MERIT

Regardless of the movie's artistic merits, the audio-visual execution is impeccable. Anyone into disaster/destruction thrills should seek this movie. The CGI is realistic to the minutest of details and the surround sound engineers made sure that you will feel the collapse of the Earth's crust pounding in your tummy - if you play it loud enough.

THE PREMISE

As it was the case with 'The Day After' - global warming triggers a new ice age - the 2012 science ranges somewhere halfway between implausible to plain ridiculous. The idea that neutrinos coming out of the Sun ""mutate"" into a different particle and heat up the Earth's core (but not, let's say, the scientists who came up with the explanation) would cause most physicists to either pull their hair in frustration or laugh uncontrollably. And I won't even touch the mystical aspect (Mayan predictions) which make it all so much confusing: was there some supernatural force that forced the Sun to produce 'mutated' neutrinos? We don't know.

A lot of the movie's science is ridiculous beyond belief. Overnight thousand-mile shifts of Earth's crust or the magnetic pole moving to Wisconsin would be outcomes of changes so catastrophic, we would see not mile-high tsunamis but watch (so to speak) the entire planet break into pieces. My impression is that the script writers either had no idea of what they were writing about or maybe they underestimated the audience's ability to detect nonsense when 'scientific words' were used. Quite depressing.

THE STORY

Well... we have two main threads. It's the end of life as we know it, with billions dying and, equally important, the story of Jackson's (John Cusack) family that starts as 'split' (divorce?) but, by the time the Himalayas go under water, they are reunited and it's reasonable to assume that they won't separate again, at least not before the children grow up or another disaster affects the family's inegrity.

RATING

I will give this movie 2 stars for the picture and the sound effects. And these are not 'cheap thrills' given the $200 million budget. Sadly, there's not much more there. A little bit of humor when portraying a Russian tycoon and an end of the world enthusiast living in a tent at Yellowstone (they both die) and John Cusack's reliably good performance and not much else.

The entire movie as you might guess is predictable. The story is on life support at best.

But the worst part is that the government officials are pretty much the only the survivors. Its 2 hrs and 37 minutes long and the effects start after the first hr. If the story had been focused on the one scientist who gave so much life to the story it would have been a better movie. Instead it on John Cusacks character and his multiple failures as a husband, father and author.

The movie has one of the best, if not the best, visual effect in any disaster movie I ever saw.

3735099,4,B001OQCV2E,"First of all, I think the DVD had a few good extras in it.  You see a relatively long clip on how the movie is made and an alternative ending with a few deleted scenes.

The film itself had some interesting special effects. Living in the Los Angeles area, it was fascinating seeing what is basically your whole world coming apart, again.  I think that is at least the fifth time in recent history including Independence Day, Terminator, The Day After Tomorrow, and of course in the past, The War of the Worlds.

Interesting too was the reference to the earth shifting on its axis, and used to get them to a desination faster, okay, well....

I did like Woody Harrelson playing a type of Harry Truman from Mt. Saint Helens fame wrapped up into an Art Bell type radio character.  Pretty funny stuff.  The scene of Yellow Stone getting whacked was interesting, makes you wonder if and when that does happen, what the result will be.

One person mentioned the politicians getting rescued, let's not forget the very rich as well.  Makes you wonder, if there were a disaster at this scale, what would be the endeavor to save as many lives as possible?  What would our leaders do?

I felt the story line took a couple of swings at England and Rome, not sure why they were singled out and seemingly made to look rediculous.

I don't know what movie the rest of these brain-fried people saw. I'm sure glad I watched the movie before reading their 3rd grade diatribes.

This was one of the most excellent, thrilling, action-packed disaster movies I've ever seen. There's not a boring moment in the entire movie and has you on the edge of your seat every moment.

It was a pleasure to finally see a disaster movie which is truly packed with disasters destroying the entire planet and every identifiable landmark instead of wasting time with ridiculous side stories. Most of the movie is through the viewpoint of global scientists, leaders and the struggle of one family to survive. I watched it for the disaster storyline, not their personal stories. When people complain about the lack of depth for the family, this is a disaster movie, not Sleepless in Seattle. If they had spent a lot of time on the personal issues of families, it would have ruined the movie and impeded the flow of suspense.

I'm thankful they kept to the main core of the plot ""The destruction of the Earth!"" The entire movie was a fresh concept for global destruction. I was surprised to learn that these were not spaceships... although I think that would have been neat as well. However, it did not make as much sense for the two leaders which stayed behind, as it might have made if these had been interplanetary vehicles.

While I understand the concept that no gov't would inform the population of such a cataclysmic event due to global panic and violence which would ensue from the very type of people who wrote those ridiculous critiques... many could have survived via ships or high altitudes if they had known planetary flooding was the main issue.

You can also bet the wealthy, famous and chosen few would be the ones to get the seats. It isn't pretty, but unfortunately, realistic (as was the elimination of anyone who threatened to spill the beans). However, I doubt the escape ships would have all been in China. Each country would have had their own assembled at their respective black ops sites, under their control.

It was obvious the person in charge of the plane flight scenes had no knowledge of aerodynamics or piloting. Planes simply cannot fly like that and would have stalled and crashed within minutes. However, it did not make it any less exciting. Having had about the same amount of flying skills, I did share Gordon's horrific predicament at being expected to fly a plane he had never trained for. That part was realistic but I doubt he would have managed that well under those conditions (not even in a simulator). However, it didn't dampen the excitement of the scenes.

Same with the unbelievable driving escape scenes where no vehicle could survive the bizarre destruction sequences. Yet, no less exciting even though we knew it was over the top. We were still on the edge of our seats all the way.

On the ""divorced family being saved by the part time dad"" issue... that has been overused from movies like Day after Tomorrow and War of the Worlds, so the theme is too repetitious as is the bratty kid routine which was also used in the Day the Earth Stood still. So, on this subject, these directors and writers do need to get away from these overused themes. In this film, would have opted to save Gordon in this scenario since he was the one who earned the family's love & respect.

You can also bet that the cell phones and electricity would not be working and there would have been in a lot more global panic. However, our beloved media & political circus would have certainly been making jokes chastising everyone for making a big deal out of nothing (as depicted) while the planet was disintegrating beneath their feet. Have to keep the masses calm no matter what.

The officials also seemed to be unreasonably blind as to what was occurring globally when they had access to hundreds of orbiting satellite systems. It took these survivors a month to find out that one of the continents had not flooded, (despite the supertech ops center they had?) As a director, I would have opted to flood all of the continents. I would not have left any landmass untouched because that really changed the dynamics.

I would also have also opted for a simple discovery of the father alive on his ship & his rescue without the alternate ending discourse dialogue. Tsunami's are not as bad at sea as they are near a coast. At sea, they are swells, not waves, so it is likely large ships out at deep sea would have faired quite well. The film's research on realistic effects of cataclysmic occurrences was a bit thin.

Opening the gates of the ships at the last moment was in poor judgment. If they had done so earlier, it would have been ok, but to wait until the tidal wave was on the way was most definitely not the smartest thing to do with humanity at stake.

It would have been better with the President all the way to the end of the movie. The Secret Service would not have left him under any circumstances despite any protest he might have made. He would have never been out of their sight and they would have taken him by force if necessary to save him and the continuity of gov't. I think this should have been handled quite differently than it was. I did not agree with the fate of this character. He should have been a survivor and an inspiration to the survivors.

Even with these improvements I would have opted for, I still loved the movie. It was a great disaster film!

Don't listen to these brain-fried low brows that were probably dragged away from their favorite sports game and beer, etc., by their families and forced to watch the movie. Their lack of education and mentality is obvious just by reading their mindless attempts to attack the director and film to get revenge for missing their favorite TV sports; It was obvious just by the time of year and date this film was released. The reviews improved as soon as football season was over. That should tell you something about the hostility & validity of those holiday reviews.

Think for yourself. If you enjoy action packed disaster movies, you will love this movie. It outdoes any disaster movie ever made. If you are looking for soapy relationships... then perhaps Sleepless in Seattle is a better choice for you. If you are looking for info on the Mayans & 2012... then you should look for documentaries with that info. But this is not for thin-skinned picayune whiners who are impossible to please.

This movie is for people who love disaster and action movies. The scientific concept of this disaster is fresh and original. The director does a great job of destroying every famous landmark and anticipated trouble spot across the planet. You get to see California fall into the ocean; the Yellowstone Caldera in a magnificent explosion; Hawaii buried in lava; the Sistine Chapel crumbling into dust around the masses; the Las Vegas casino's disintegrating magnificently; the destruction of Brazil's landmarks; Washington DC in ruins; California skyscrapers crashing around their ears; incredible tsunami's miles high... covering every coast on the globe; continents tearing apart into horrific chasms taking everything of civilization down with it. You can't ask for more than this movie has to offer in disasters. A refreshing change from all those movies where they usually save civilization in the nick of time. Not this one. They utterly destroy it along with a majority of the population, in full realistic ""top of the line"" effects!

This is by far the best disaster movie ever made with the most fantastic effects you could ever hope for. It is truly like riding the world's scariest roller coaster for almost 3 hours. You are on the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie. Not a boring moment. The tension is tight from start to finish and will twist you into knots without a chance to catch your breath. There are no pauses between the action and constant tension. The bigger the screen, the better you will appreciate the experience. This ultimate disaster movie is indeed all about the fantastic special effects. They did not scrimp on any of them.

You will not be disappointed if you love disaster movies crammed with global destruction and special effects. This film outdoes any disaster movie ever made.",1268265600,2,8297,4.724757952973721

It's kind of funny that the most noticed ""discussion"" of the Mayan etc End Times prophecies would be a classically cheesoid disaster flick. If that doesn't actually justify some big old End Times, well, just add an American Idol tune to celebrate Saving The Politicians, and we're good to go!

So manipulative, so laughable, so enjoyably over the top in the effects department, so ridiculous in general...all in all, so-so. Emmerich is hardly the guy you'd expect to make a truly thoughtful movie about the Apocalypse, and you'd be quite right. He's the guy who'll somehow fashion a ""Happy Ending"" TM, while casually massacring a few billion people to get there. But hey, if John Cusack and family are ok, there's some hope left, no?

No.

I'd rather go down in the Really Really Big Tidal Wave while lying on the sofa listening to Charlie Parker with my honey, thanks.

I wish I read Chinese so I could enjoy their reviews of this hoot, and their place as ArkMakers Extraordinaire...but not ArkRiders! Of all the idiotic moments here, the airlifting of the elephants and giraffes through the Himalayas has to take the cake. ""Hey, stop one of those choppers carrying Babar over K2 and let's get rescued!"" And of course not once at about 15,000 to 20,000 feet are any of these folks, who just showed up hours ago, wheezing or in any way showing the always intense effects of the the thin air so high up. It takes days for pro mountaineers to acclimate...but not suburbanites Johnny C. and co! If you're going to be so picky about getting effects right, at least pay a tiny amount of care to more obvious reality issues, Herr Emmerich.

If you don't mind inane plot movement and insane plot deficiency, all in the service of yet another EndOfTheWorldExplosionFestShotInBlu-Ray, then this puppy has your number all over it. But if you really have any serious interest in the subject, this is perhaps the very last thing you need to see about Winter Solstice, 2012.

Still, it's a great way to waste almost three hours, while reminding yourself why it is that the loss of the human race won't be the worst thing to happen to the Planet Earth.

3735114,4,B001OQCV2E,"When it comes to science or half-way logical thinking, ""2012"" is a big joke. As a movie and entertainment though, it is another great offering that only Roland Emmerich can deliver. Personally, I never bought into the 2012 Apocalypse phenomenon, much like I came to reject the Y2K bug scare back in late 1999.
 The movie begins in 2009 where scientists discover a surge in solar activity. Back in L.A., a chauffer works for a Russian billionaire named Yuri Karpov, and is estranged from his wife and son and daughter.  In 2012, the sun unleashes solar mega-flares that are larger than any in recorded history and in addition to powerful flare-ups, unleashes enormous levels of neutrinos which interact with the Earth's core, causing the Mantle's temperature to soar by magnitudes causing the crust to undergo violent shifts and pole reversals. Yet, suddenly, perpetually violent earthquakes caused the Earth's crust to crumble and shift on a scale never before seen in human history and all must escape the crumbling Pacific Plate (Where L.A. lies on) and fly to China (Tibet to be exact) to get onto specially built structures that will serve as places where humanity will survive the coming Apocalypse.
 When it comes to acting or character development, none of the characters are really all that interesting other than the fact that they fight for survival into the post-apocalyptic post-2012 world. None of them really are all that significant other than the fact that John Cusack plays the primary protagonist. I DO however like how it makes the Earth as the primary antagonist.

 In terms of special effects, ""2012"" excels in extreme mayhem and destruction as entire continents crumble, oceans shift, the core's temperature soars, magnetic pole reversals, cities being decimated in minutes,",1268179200,2,1796,5.1160409556314

This father also allows his children to witness the decaying of a dead animal who was evidently burnt by fire burning brimstone that seeped from the core which also dried up the lake. ""Oh well kids, lets camp out near the site anyway. I see no danger."" Lets not forget he's a super hero who some how manages to save his family from being swollen by the earth....and several times he saves himself and others from scenes that are life threathening.

(3.) Weak story with too many stolen-from-other-movies stereotypes, e.g. Russian fighter; divorced dad trying to entertain kids and ex-wife; female escort with mini-dog; crazy DJ (another bizarre and poor acting by Harrelson); government conspiracies and assassinations; pack the kids to escape the apocalypse; driving cars off of crashing airplanes in snow fields.",1268179200,2,890,5.6

3735121,4,B001OQCV2E,"I like this genre, full of special effects, suspense and soap opera. Ever since ""The Guns of Navarone"" ('61), when I was a mere child, I knew the good stuff was coming. It paid off. With the current rash of CGI stuff, I have to admit that I was entertained by the effects, and especially by a few good performances, especially Oliver Platt as the oily snake politician. As usual, John Cusack and Chiwetel Ejiofor cannot disappoint. Good stuff also from Woody Harrelson, Amanda Peet, Tom McCarthy and Thandie Newton. I visited Chichen Itza a few weeks ago. The Mayan calendar ends on 12/21/12 but most people think it's only because that's when they gave up writing it, when the Toltecs took over and virtually destroyed that civilization. I had a problem with the sound recording, and a few other elements that make a good action film. Soap opera elements will always figure in to make a story to qualify the scenario. The only exception I can think of would be James Cameron's exhausting ""Aliens"", my favorite of all. ""2012"" didn't stink. But, at 2  hours, there was more than was needed. Most of the best action sci-fi/disaster films have been long (Towering Inferno, etc.), and the script doesn't seem to matter.

And the parts where he jumps the limo, and then later jumps the RV. It was embarassing. And then the parts that attempt humor- I just wanted to throw a brick through my TV screen.

But it takes more than that, and I just couldn't even begin to get around the two glaring flaws of this movie:  [1]  The pure cheesiness of the plot which mines every cliche that Hollywood has ever had; and [2] the completely incredible (literally) ability of the protagonists to survive disaster over and over again.  To sum up, this is a movie with awe-inspiring visuals, but with a plot worthy of poor animation.",1268092800,11,669,4.442622950819672
3735166,4,B001OQCV2E,"The cgi is outstanding, and well worth a rental.  The soundtrack on blu ray is also impressive with lots of bass.  As for the story, well thank goodness they spared us the 'parent separated from their child spending the whole movie trying to reunite with them', which is so often the plot of many disaster movies.  And unlike most disaster movies where you only get a few minutes of special effects, this movie is choc a bloc with them.

So what's at fault? The story just misses in many ways. I wasn't happy with the list of who died and who lived -- there were some that didn't make it that impacted my satisfaction with the movie, and others I would have rather sacrificed. There were plot points that just got dropped at the end.  For example, so much was made of the little girl's hats I fully expected it to eventually have some plot point to them -- to be like the glasses of water kid in the m night shamalayan movie.  If there was a point to that, I missed it. And while there was some good vs evil themes and characters, some selfish versus altruistic moralising in the movie, the selfish really didn't get theirs, nor did the good really win. Much is made of the crassness and near evil of one politician, but he goes through the movie basically unchanged. The 'good' characters also seem to come through the movie relatively unchanged. So the movie ended more with a whimper than a bang in character development.

I think if they had worked on the story a little harder, as hard as they did the cgi, they'd have had a movie worthy of the spectacular special effects, one people would be rushing to buy. As it was, few of the characters made you really care about them one way or another.  It's not that the movie wasn't good as a popcorn movie, it's just that with all that effort to make the special effects state of the art you wonder why they didn't work equally as hard to make the story compelling. Why put all that effort into a so so script with mediocre characterization? Most characters didn't grow or change. Those that did change, did so inexplicably, like the bratty kids suddenly becoming nice?  Right, that's likely to happen. It was sloppy, hit or miss writing in that respect.

I also think it would have been good to go back to the Mayans who predicted the 2012 disaster and then bring it forward - seems odd to have a movie about the mayan prediction that ignored the mayan origin.  I also would have liked to see more flooding. Lots of volcanos and earthquakes, but not so much flooding, until the end.  While new york has been done to death, why not show london being submerged, the eye floating away?  That was a missed opportunity.  I also would have liked to see the end position of the continents:  a sort of pangeatic configuration. This was talked of, but never shown.

Still, even though the story was weak, I would have purchased the blu ray for the cgi alone, because I enjoy disaster flicks, except for the price. 24.99 is just too much. If the story were compelling and uplifting, that would be another thing, but for cgi alone, as this was, this will stay a rental for me until the price comes down.",1268006400,5,3143,4.430555555555555

When I saw the previews, and learned that Roland Emmerich was the director, well, it all made sense.  Of course the visual effects in the trailers were awesome, but I didn't feel like buying into the 2012, end of the world story line. I'd thought Emmerich had been a tad heavy handed with ""Day After Tomorrow"" and so I avoided ""2012"" at the box office and waited for ""Avatar.""

After seeing ""2012"" on Blu-Ray, I admit I was wrong.  If you just suspend disbelief a little bit, sit back, and allow yourself to be entertained, this film will not disappoint.  No mistaking here, willful suspension of disbelief is necessary.  There are just too many close calls, near misses, and coincidences to take the film on anything but a surface level.  But, if you allow yourself to be drawn in to the eye popping special effects, the incredible depth of detail in the CGI rendering of destruction,  the wry sense of humor, you can actually have a pretty good time with this movie.  My son said he can't wait for this film to be turned into some kind of ride at Universal Orlando.

It IS a long movie, and the characters are paper thin, with a plot that hangs on a thread of scientific information. But, it doesn't FEEL long, you become invested in the characters, and the science begins not to matter. In fact, the film's pace moves along quite nicely. And though the characters are thin, you do ""root"" for John Cusack to succeed in saving his estranged wife, resentful son, and precocious daughter. Heck, halfway through you even begin rooting for the wife's boyfriend to survive! How the film resolves itself is actually a bit of a surprise (if it hasn't been spoiled for you elsewhere). I actually think that the marketing of the film did a disservice. If more of the character driven moments had been shown in the previews, I probably would have bit on seeing the movie in a theater.

And so, there is an entertaining plot with interesting characters, lot of really excellent visual effects, and a satisfying ending.  It even survives multiple screenings.  The Blu-Ray  2 disc special edition includes a few deleted scenes, an alternate ending (too much suspension of disbelief required), and a variety of behind the scenes featurettes. I think it's a good value.

I do have to mention that the U.S.S. John F. Kennedy aircraft carrier was retired from active duty several years ago, and therefore would not be at sea, in a position to tumble into the White House as a tsunami wipes out Washington in 2012.  Having said that, I must humorously add that Danny Glover's President Thomas Wilson had the entirely wrong line as he looked up to see the ship coming. He should have said, ""I'm too old for this s#$t!""

Enter on the keyboard & the OK button on my remote had no effect. the splash sceen just repeats, and repeats, and repeats, and repeats, and repeats, and repeats...

So I updated the player software, thinking that might be the issue. Again, no effect. Changed the aspect ratio from 16x9 to 4x3 - same thing, no menu commands. Tried the standard single disc BR (from a local retailer) and had the same issue. I'm heading to that local retailer to test them both out on a BR player they have there.

I called that store & the clerk said ""I'm not the first person to have this issue"" and that he ""has seen three other customers return the BR copy.""

Oh, and the update from HP disabled the HD-DVD playback on my PC... that's a whole other kettle of fish, but it was definitely salt in the wound!

Looks like the folks at Sony didn't do any testing on this batch of BluRay discs or the aspect ratio translation puts the menu BELOW the video instead of IN it.",1267920000,2,1465,4.513207547169811
3735177,3,B001OQCV2E,"if nothing else,this end of the world flick form disaster specialist Roland Emmerich was entertaining.there sure was a lot of CGI used here.in fact probably ninety percent of the movie is comprised of it. December 21,2012 is the day that the Mayans predict a cataclysmic event will occur on earth,which has led to speculation that the world as we know will cease to exist.the movie only makes passing reference of the Mayan's,and instead just focus on on the destruction and mayhem side of things.maybe it's just me,but the special effects don't seems to have improved much in the last six years or so since the The Day After Tomorrow another big budget disaster opus,also from Roland Emmerich,which had a nearly comparable amount of CGI.or maybe i'm just jaded,and CGI really isn't that exciting more.either way,2012 failed to fully engage me,on an excitement level.the movie does however,has one thing in its favour.unlike many flicks of the genre,there were no real maudlin or sappy moments,no over the top corn ball inspirational speeches.and i loved Woody Harrelson's character.i also thought Thandie Newton was good as well.the movie wasn't boring.and for a movie that clocks in at 150 minutes before the end credits roll,that's something.for me,2012 is a 3/5",1267920000,,1265,5.175609756097561
3735178,4,B001OQCV2E,"This movie certainly has many things to complain about from way too many close escapes and outlandish lucky breaks to lack of character and relationship development, but in the end, this is the kind of movie we watch because of the disaster story, and in that respect, the movie is pretty true to some of the books and ideas it is most likely based on. The Earth crust displacement theory has kind of been left behind, even by Graham Hancock, author of the Fingerprints of the Gods, the book that the movie was supposedly based in part on, but in general, this movie is based on a lot of ideas from not only that book, but books on the Mayan calendar, the  Yellowstone caldera and probably a few others. Of course many of these ideas are just plain outlandish and scientifically unfeasible or would represent a highly unlikely confluence of events with very low odds of happening all at the same time. However, all that being said, this isn't the kind of movie we watch because we think it represents what really might happen. It's the kind of movie we watch because we think it would be interesting and entertaining to see visually what it might look like to see some of the things people suggest in disaster books. The director's previous movie, The Day After Tomorrow, was a similar example of this, being based mostly on the book The Coming Superstorm. Now this movie plays into the popularity of The Fingerprints of the Gods. I would recommend this movie for entertainment purposes and because it does reference a number of disaster scenarios. Just don't go into it thinking it is a realistic portrayal of something that's scientifically possible.",1267920000,,1652,4.716262975778546

First, the acting was fine.  But this isn't what this movie is about.  Excellent actors were cast and did their job, but what made this film really good was the incredible special effects.  If there were a few story holes or the storyline was a bit simple (we were able to predict with 100% accuracy who would die and when, and sometimes even the coming facial expression or last words -- it was pretty predictable) -- who cares? We felt like the plot was comfy old shoes to rest in while we watched awesome effects.

The premise is that in 2012, the world will end.  That is no spoiler.  But how it happens is well worth watching.  California drops into the sea!  Tsunamis cover India and most of the world.  Will anyone survive?  Watch and see!",1267920000,,979,4.377777777777778
3735181,5,B001OQCV2E,"One of the best computer silmulation base scenario film. You should know - this not a psychological film, this is not just another one catastrophic film. This the film based on the computer simulations. The charachters, psychology is only a background of it and the least important. Pure computer scenario schould show you shot by shot the following computer simulation events without any actors, only pure effetc and numbers like that 6hrs - 4 mln death toll, 12 hrs - 1 bln toll, panic everywhere, 48 hrs - 5 bln toll, no countries at all; free Cape of Good Hope, some lands in South America. 72 hrs 1 mln survived. Claps. The next shots will show you appropriate simulation of a civilization rebuilding. It is to be understood that dialogues are only a filling and the conntections between the next shots. And they are quite well. The authority actions are shown as they are. Thus, very good simulations and good observations.

Next time the director might think of a team of specialists caring of proper mass behaviour, political actions corectness, military actions corectness, physical and geological (seismic) corectness. If the film budget is about of 100 mln $, thus hiring mass behaviour psycholgists, ex-soldiers, seismologists, physicists, doctors, politologists, retired politicians isn't that expensive and the film gains the true reality. The natural continuation of 2012 is 2013 - Civilization Rebuilding. If you can show destruction, very probable, show the construction, too. As for the physical reality of the film: we don't know exactly the neutrino production mechanism in the Sun. Thus, it may happen the stream of it will rise suddenly, and during neutrino oscillation some electron neutrinos may transit into other types that may be dumped very stron by liquid iron that makes Earth's core. By the way, the first direct observation of an electron neutrio done by Cowan and Reines in 1959 in CERN was by means of large amount of the very iron that makes the Earth core. The whole Swiss iron supply was used in that experiment. Finally, the film is unlike others where brave American boys save the world from unavoiding disaster. The disaster touches the Catholic Hierachy, too. And the God permits that situation, which is very embarrasing to them, they are awaitnig for God's save and they are awaitnig for nothing. As many Polish priests during World War II who died in concentration camps. They were not saved from death, but if you asked them in the 19th century if it would be possible they would very probably deny. Thus, the physical idea of the catastroph is valid, but very little probable. But, the film doesn't discuss the probability - the case happend. In my opinion the film deserves two Oscars: for original scenario and for the special effects. Moreover, as the other people noticed, Emmerich together with other new directors created the new branch in the cinema art - a computer simulation base scenario film. But to make the films more realistic and more didactic many specialists from different science areas should be employed. And such a movie should be made in 3D with octophonic sound to position the film sound very precise in the space so that other viewers would hear different voices from different part of a cinama hall (they will have to attend the film many times to collect all experiences). And one more answer for the question why there was not a tsunami when the California cliff fell into the Pacific Ocean.

Part of the success of a disaster film is making the viewer imagine the horror of being in the depicted situation.  Since nothing like the events depicted in ""2012"" has happened in recent history, it's difficult to imagine the events really happening.  There have been disasters recently, but nothing like those in this film.  The effects are believable, and interesting if you enjoy watching national and global landmarks being destroyed.  The film, however, is hard to believe.  Reviews have called it the ""best disaster movie in history"", hardly.  ""The Towering Inferno"" and ""The Poseidon Adventure"" both made in the 1970s, involve scenarios that could and actually have happened.

As other reviewers have noted, the special effects in this movie are excellent and will keep your eyes glued to the screen when they are doing their best to destroy the world.  As for storyline, forget it.  This movie jumps around so much that your head will spin trying to keep track of what's going on with the characters.  Characters are introduced and then you don't see them again for such a long time that when they reappear you realize you forgot they were even in the movie.  Another annoying trend in this movie is to needlessly kill off sympathetic characters for no legitimate reason.  At least the elephants live...
This movie evokes memories of disaster movies of the past: THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, THE TOWERING INFERNO, VOLCANO, EARTHQUAKE, WHEN WORLDS COLLIDE...Roland Emmerich seemed to want to pay homage to them all in one mixed up, crazy bag of mind-spinning mayhem.
It also reminds you of how skillful Irwin Allen was at putting together a disaster movie with at least a somewhat logical plot, interesting characters saying interesting lines, and not intentionally letting the special effects overshadow his actors.  Yes, Mr. Allen, we miss ya!

3735206,4,B001OQCV2E,"According to the Mayan calendar, the end of the world is supposed to occur on the Winter Solstice, 2012.  This prophecy comes true in this action-packed adventure movie.  At the beginning of the movie, a scientist discovers huge solar flares bursting forth from the sun.  Along with these flares, the earth's continents are shifting on their plates.  Soon, massive cracks are forming, which swallow entire buildings.  It seems as if the Mayan prediction is coming true.

John Cusack (Jackson Curtis) is a struggling novelist who has picked his children up for a camping trip from his estranged wife (Amanda Peet) and her plastic surgeon boyfriend.  They decide to camp at Yellowstone National Park.  Upon arriving, they decide to find the spot where Jackson and his wife used to go; a beautiful, secluded lake.  Once they reach the spot, they discover that the lake has literally evaporated.  Discovered by U.S. Army personnel, Jackson and his children are ordered off the premises.  Jackson, sensing something is completely wrong, rushes back to his wife's house.  He manages to pick up his wife and her boyfriend just before the town literally falls into the ocean.  Thus begins a global adventure for Jackson and his family as they try to out-run tsunamis, earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and massive tidal waves in an attempt to reach three secret ""arks"" built by the governments of the world as lifeboats for survivors.  Will they reach these ""arks"" in time?

I found ""2012"" to be an exciting movie to watch.  Danny Glover, Woody Harrelson, John Cusack, and Amanda Peet turn in good performances, and the special effects are exciting to see.  The tidal waves that covered the Himalayas is one of the film's high points.  Roland Emmerich, the film's director, has directed other good action movies, including ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and ""Independence Day"".  ""2012"" follows in the steps of these great movies.

I recommend this movie very highly.  The special effects will leave viewers spellbound.  If you enjoy good adventure movies, then be sure to see ""2012"".",1267833600,,2068,5.056213017751479

3735209,1,B001OQCV2E,"I knew I was in trouble almost from the start of this 2 hr and 28 min film. I began to ask questions and my disbelief radar went up. I didn't expect much from Roland Emmerich. He has made a couple of the worst movies ever. I knew that this film wasn't going to be high art. I had read the critics and knew about the bad acting, terrible script, and the cheesiness of it all, but I still thought I'd see a good no-brainer where things get blown up real good. What I did not expect was the lack of rationality, script cohesion, awful science, and bad CGI. I was too aware of the awfulness of it all to enjoy this disaster of a disaster movie. The only consolation of sitting through 2 1/2 hours of bad film were my frequent giggles at terribly delivered lines by the actors (perhaps the worst acting by the otherwise fine John Cusak ever), bad science, and idiotic use of CGI. After the first hour of watching, I wondered if this film was actually meant to be a parody of such films. I certainly laughed a lot.

My initial suspension of disbelief began at the start of the film. John Cusak is late to pick up his kids from his divorced wife's house to go on a camping trip. His car does not start. In the next scene we see him getting into a limo and using it for transportation. No explanation is given of why he has access to a limo until halfway through the film. He picks up his kids and off they go on the camping trip. Arriving at Yellowstone, I felt that the producers must have made a mistake. He left from southern California in a limo on a camping trip with 2 young children. Perhaps they confused Yellowstone with Yosemite. No, it was no mistake. I, the viewer, am expected to believe that he drove all the way to Yellowstone in a matter of hours in a limo.  And not only once. He drives back to California and returns to Yellowstone. That must be some limo.

Once my suspension of disbelief was destroyed, I noticed everything else that was bad about the film, so many of them that I began to laugh out loud: The supermarket that splits into two jagged parts, a light plane flying amidst a city being torn apart (this impossible feat of flying is repeated later in the film) , a main character using a cell phone after being told that all global communication was not working (repeated on the ark), a crack appearing between the hand of God and David in the Sistine Chapel, the dog running for the ark (yeah! save that dog!). All so remarkably bad.

When I first saw this in theaters I had somewhat high expectations. The only previous Emmerich films I'd seen prior to this were Independence Day and Godzilla. Given my limited experience to his work, but with remnants of nostalgia from ID4 (loved it as a kid), I went in expecting this same kind of formula: an element of doom that threatens humanity (malevolent aliens, or in this case the end of the world), people uniting in response to that threat (after the damage had already been done, of course), and in the process exposing humanity's faults for what they are, therefore, eliminating our differences and bringing us closer together as a people. I caught on to this back in the theater, but naivety got the best of me and I think my change in tastes over the years (it's been about a decade since I've seen either of those movies) has caused me to over-analyze Emmerich's latest film. To be blunt, I hated this movie the first time I saw it. The cheese, campiness, ostentatious melodrama, and writing problems bugged me. Now? I don't think it's as bad as before. Despite this movie being a little longer than I'd like, I actually found some very profound themes on a subsequent viewing: mortality (how we take life for granted), selflessness (or vice versa, if you look at all the snobbery throughout some of the characters), and just the very fact of how disconnected we are as a species (which Emmerich tries to build through the many, many characters and their relationships throughout the film, but never really succeeds in fleshing out). The special effects are spiffy and I'm really starting to like Chiwetel Ejiofor as an actor. Maybe I found these themes by accident, but turning my mind to ""popcorn mode"" actually made said themes a little more impacting overall. With that said, these themes are still too unfocused than can make up for all the cheese and ""fun,"" but I can say I actually like the movie at least a little more than I disliked it before. If I had to summarize the movie, I'd say ""go popcorn, but expect a few surprises.""

Video - 4.5

Sony presents us with an excellent 1080p picture in an original aspect ratio of 2.35:1 framed at 2.39. Colors are especially prominent and diverse throughout the film ranging from very accurate skin tones to lush landscape views and, of course, meteorological destruction. This is complimented by outstanding contrast levels making explosions, smoke, and all that other CG anarchy look flawless. Black levels are also handled near-perfectly, though I think I saw a little color banding through some of the darker-lit scenes. Sharpness, details, textures, and line delineation are also spot-on, adding a great sense of depth and HD pop to the film's presentation. Water during the tsunami scenes in particular stand out to me the most and, despite the weak writing, are amazing to look at from a visual and aesthetic point of view. All the crumbling buildings, fireballs, and earth-splitting are certainly a sight to behold. If at least not for the corresponding reference audio, this is a demo-worthy disc to showcase your HD home theaters for video as well. Which brings me to...

Audio - 5.0

These days in Hollywood, mayhem usually begets a very strong and active sound field. 2012 is no exception to that as Sony's DTS-HD 5.1 track is every bit as frenetic and chaotic as what you're seeing on the screen. High and low ends are reproduced perfectly. Grinding gravel, shattering glass, the rumbling earth, molten lava, gargantuan tidal waves, vehicle engines, and every other discernible sound effect add an extra level of realism that make the special effects so much more enjoyable. The sub-woofer stays relatively quiet pre-Apocalypse, but when that crust displacement thing starts kicking in, you'll be happy to know that sub you bought is earning its money's worth. Dialogue also stays clear throughout the entire film, never losing consistency in volume level. Separation of said dialogue and all the special effects noises are never a problem either, with directionality giving a very spacious feeling to said destruction all across the sound board. Again, like the video, this would make an especially good reference BD to wow and showcase to your friends.

Extras - 3.5

As much as I like to give commentaries a listen for whatever kind of extra information on production or writing that they have, I'm going to be honest and say I don't think I have it in me to sit through this movie two more times for both a P-i-P and audio commentary track. After watching the standalone featurettes on disc 2, I find Roland Emmerich to be something of a paradox. He seems like a very detail-attentive director who takes pride in his craft; that craft for this particular movie being a spiffy visual feast of destruction, mayhem, and a sort of child-like imagination in the way those ideas come to fruition. However, unlike a Michael Bay or Jon Turteltaub who both possess that ""big kid director"" kind of approach to movie-making, I feel Emmerich lacks in general enthusiasm as a whole, at least that's the feeling I got from the interviews here. And to sit through two and a half hours of that blandness twice is just not something I'd rather use my free time for. That being said, I give Sony a lot of credit for putting these extras together. A good majority of them focus a lot on production and the ego of Emmerich and his ""master technique"" for making epic disaster films (of which only one really stands out to me at this time), while the rest of the features are tied into the whole Mayan Calender and impending Apocalypse craze. I found these parts to be interesting at some points, but then blatantly insulting at others. For a movie about the end of the world that supposedly uses scientific ""truth"" and reasoning for a believable premise, the ""experts"" interviewed here are more than adamant to the point of either saying ""it could happen,"" or as that one scientist said ""it will happen [and that I've been right all along because this movie is so well-crafted by Emmerich, how can it not be the truth?]."" On top of that, he goes on to use the excuse that the reason most regular people won't believe his theory is because of a subconscious defense to the ""fear"" that our lives will, indeed, end when he says it will according to the Mayan Calender. Take from these segments what you will, but after such a brazen display in ideological put-downs that nearly defeated the purpose of the movie for me, I have to say it's a strange array of extras that gets an A in effort, but a C in continuity and bias.

Overall - 4.0

I didn't like the film so much the first time around, but was surprised upon a repeat viewing. For me, I like movies that manage to have a little bit of everything: good production values, an engaging story and/or characters that, when aptly put together, make for some semblance of entertainment or thought-provocation, and a good cast of actors/actresses. 2012, while on the extremely high end of production values, also has a surprising amount profundity with more or less cookie-cutter archetypal characters, though with a good performance by one Chiwetal Ejiofor. Consequently, the presence of many an absurdity represented by some of the supporting/unnecessary characters, cheesy screenplay, silly script, and unfocused attention to some of the finer details in the writing ruin what could've made this a much more fulfilling and epic Apocalypse film. I wish I could say this is more than another popcorn flick and a definite must-own title outside of its reference A/V presentation, but I consider this a rental at best. However, if you're happy enough with the popcorn mentality and aren't bothered by some of the movie's faults, then this is definitely worth adding to your collection.",1267747200,4,7808,4.80789277736411

Almost every action movie cliche' known to man and the entire universe is used in this movie. Over and over. And over again. The harrowing escapes from certain death, repeatedly, actually had me crying out at one point ""Oh, COME ON!""

Incredibly dodgy science walks hand in hand with miraculous coincidence and appallingly bad story lines. With that in mind, why the 5 stars? Because, with a whole heap of Schadenfreude, this is one of the great comedies of our time.

2012 is not in the 'So bad it's awful' category of films like the Keanu Reeves remake of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Day-the-Earth-Stood-Still/dp/B001SGEUYW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Day the Earth Stood Still</a>.

From Woody Harrelson commentating on the greatest volcanic eruption ever ""I wish you guys could see what I'm seeing"" and what we are seeing is his chunky builders butt; to John Cusack's deadpan ""We're going to need a bigger plane"" when he finds out he has to fly to China; to the wildly spinning clock that jumps from seconds to minutes, counting down to the moment the tidal wave hits; to a riotous, Oscar worthy, performance by Zlatko Buric who steals every scene as the jowly Russian oligarch Yuri Karpov: ""Engine, shtooooooaart!"" To truly brilliant, yet absurdly hilarious (here is where the Schadenfreude comes in), special effects: flying trains, USS JFK destroying the White House, Hawaii in flames.

How can you not laugh when every convention of the disaster movie is rolled out before you in such crystal clarity? When every obvious plot developement is followed to the letter? The plane that out runs Yellowstone's eruption. The ex-husband pitted against the interloping new boyfriend for his families affections. The car that is faster than Tectonic quakes. The lowly scientist forced front and centre by his theories. The huge boats that survive the compete shift of earths crust regardless of the unprecedented 'getting out of the bath' kind of tidal waves it would create.

Roland Emmerich has to have made 2012 with tongue firmly in cheek!

The story is clichd. A great majority of the science is bunk. The effects are great but utterly unrelated to how the events would actually happen. The heroics are impossible. Even the politics are risible. And don't get me started on the emotional subplots in the script!

But 2012 is genuine, genuine fun. With a capital LOL! It's a LOLaster movie! I honestly have not laughed so much since QI's moonwalking bird.",1267747200,,2765,5.793103448275862

The Mayan calendar has come to an end and sure enough, the world pretty much implodes.

The quality of the digital effects is amazing (even better than the poster art!) and it's a hoot to see John Cusack out-run,  out-drive and out-fly the tectonic fracturing, the volcanic spewing and the oceanic inundation to redeem his family.

Basically, it's the story of Noah's flood retold.  It still works.  We love our myths and will probably keep retelling them until the world ends.  Or begins again.  I missed the rainbow of promise at the end of the movie's epic flooding and (spoiler here, if you haven't read your Bible) emergence of a new land.

For example, try to imagine what the world's oceans are going to be like in the aftermath of such flooding.  Sorry for the facts here.  Add in billions of animals and billions of human beings all drowned and decomposing nearly at the same time and rate and you have a toxic goo that going to the Cape of Good Hope will NOT solve. To survive in THAT aftermath; that would be a story.  Ugh.  To create a film that tells the story of the end of the world as we know it and then to end it as the film makers did is lazy.  Just plain lazy.  I think they could have come up with a more imaginative and realistic ending than they did.  BUT other than that I was entertained.  And I would watch it again.

Woody Harrelson was funny for the few minutes he was on film.

It was very ""Disney"" in the sense that of course the most terrible days before the end of the world are here, yet this small broken family is able to overcome all odds... This includes making and landing impossible street jumps while driving a LIMO... plus the fact that the earth seems to crumble DIRECTLY behind them at all steps along the way for the entire film... without giving too much away in case you actually are interested in seeing the film... The family is always able to escape *just* ahead of any disaster at hand, none of which are very believable situations.

The special effects were great, I believe a lot could have actually been done to make this movie a fantastic one. I think I would stick to discovery channel quality just to get a more realistic storyline.

3735285,5,B001OQCV2E,"You have to give credit to director Ronald Emmerich. He can certainly put on a big show, the biggest in town. His movies, such as ""Independence Day"" (1996), ""The Day after Tomorrow"" (2004) and ""10,000 BC"" (2008) are colossal and majestic. And very entertaining. ""2012"" follows this dramatic and impressive trend. It is truly a non-stop action, rollercoaster of a film, which will make your jaw drop.

According to the story, by the year 2012 all the planets in our solar system will be aligned with the sun - an event that only occurs every 640,000 years -, and this will cause the destabilization of the earth's core. This, in turn, will make the continents shift, and the world, as we know it, will rearrange itself. This will cause catastrophic earthquakes and tsunamis that will wipe out most of civilization. This apocalyptic event is discovered early in the film, when Dr, Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) visits one of his colleagues in India, who provides him with scientific evidence about our planet's imminent demise. Dr. Helmsley informs his superior, Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt), a high official at the White House, who in turn informs the president (Danny Glover). They take control of the situation and work with other nations on a contingency plan. Unbeknown to Dr. Helmsley, this plan is devised to only saved a few privileged

Enter Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), a writer that also works as a limousine driver, who is currently divorced from his wife Kate (Amanda Peet). Kate is currently married to Gordon (Thomas Mc Carthy), and lives together with the children -- Noah (Liam James) and Lilly (Morgan Lily) -- that she had with Jackson. Jackson happens to be spending a vacation at Yellowstone National Park with Noah and Lily. While at the park, they encounter some problems that had to do with the incoming disaster. Jackson also meets Charlie Frost, a radio personality that researched information about the cataclysmic events that were about to hit our planet. Although Jackson initially dismisses Charlie, he eventually learns, the hard way, that Charlie was right. Together with his children, and Kate and Gordon, Jackson will try to survive by any means necessary.

As with any other Emmerich movie, ""2012"" is loaded with awesome special effects, which will leave you asking, ""How did they do that?"" Also, as with any other Emmerich film, you will find many inconsistencies and holes. At any rate, whether the story is true or not is irrelevant -- Hollywood is known for twisting reality. And, given the recent earthquakes in Haiti and Chile, everything is possible. ""2012"" is spectacular entertainment and you can see where the money is going. The film also stars the very beautiful Thandie Newton. The Blu-ray edition includes picture-in-picture by the director, alternate ending, commentary, and movie IQ(tm).

3735286,4,B001OQCV2E,"One of the major problems with movies these days is hype. We become inundated with glimpses of movies coming out, bombarded with clips and sneak peeks, witness to countless interviews with stars and eventually we feel as if we know the entire movie coming out weeks before it hits the screen. Hype. It can make a small movie desirable or it can make a blockbuster fail. And sometimes, as in the case of 2012, it can do both.

2012 sets itself up using the notion many conspiracy types have that the Mayan calendar calls for the end of the world in that year. So the film makers took that idea and ran with it, giving us a glimpse at the possible destruction of the planet. Director Roland Emmerich is notorious for full blown special effects movies that deliver the goods and he does so once again with this film.

Of course a story needs a central figure to base the tale around and here we have John Cusak as Jackson Curtis, a science fiction novelist whose book did well at first only to see sales drop and no follow up behind it. This explains his current position as a limo driver. Divorced with an ex who has remarried, it's his weekend with the kids and off camping they go.

Earlier, scientists were noting a change in the earth's crust. Radiation from outer space was altering the make up of the Earth with dire consequences on the way. Dr. Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor) had seen the data and informed the President who put him in charge of the entire situation. His team set out to find a plan to deal with the situation or at best, to see to it that the human race at least survived.

When Cusak and the kids are in a park camping, he comes across a seeming nut job played by Woody Harrelson who is broadcasting warnings about the end of the world from his Winnebago. He shows a map to Cusak who more or less writes him off, but with a nagging feeling he could be right.

Push comes to shove, at least with the surface of the Earth and quakes begin on a low level. But knowing what it coming, Cusak calls his wife and tells her to gather the kids and get ready to move because the big one is coming. She argues and of course all hell breaks loose before she can hang up the phone.

The first major special effect sequence begins as Cusak grabs his family, including his wife's new hubby, and they head for the airport. Good thing they took him along because he is studying for his pilot's license. As the street collapsed beneath the back wheels of the limo, they barely make it to the airport and take off as the ground opens beneath them, swallowing portions of the city while the rest slides off into the ocean.

With no where in California to go, they head east and for Las Vegas where they hope to at least find fuel if nothing else. At this airport, Cusak runs into his ex-employer, a Russian businessman who was told of the impending quakes and who has paid to be in a location where humanity will be saved. Not because he offers anything worthwhile, but because he can afford it.

Again with the last minute takes off and an attempt to find the secret location, even though the poles of the Earth have now rotated out of skew and a compass isn't worth diddly. Get the picture? Last minute saves and super tremendous coincidences that are at times so far fetched as to stretch the limits of ""sustained disbelief"", the idea that this is only a movie and things could happen this way in a film. And those I've mentioned are the most believable ones!

But folks don't watch movies like this with the hopes and dreams of learning how to survive the worst. No, they go to it for escape, to watch heroes come through and (hopefully) bad guys pay the price. And more than anything with a film of this sort, they go to watch amazing special effects. On that count at least, this film delivers like no one can believe. A small screen may not press it in your face as much as the big theater could, but it is still effective.

Along the way there are other side stories and actors involved, but the main focus revolves around this core group. Each actor does a good job of playing a convincing role, be it stunned disbelief at what is going on around them or doing what it takes to make sure that your family stays together and survives catastrophe.

For a movie this big, face it, you're getting a condensed cliff notes version of what it's all about. But then to give you every detail of the film would deprive you of enjoying it. Is it that good? Well no, it isn't, but it is entertaining. Face it, more than anything you're going to enjoy the special effects and that was what drew most people in to see this movie. They are amazing.

This won't be a movie that will go down in the annals of film as one of the best, but as I said it is entertaining. And more than anything it makes you wonder what you would do in this given situation. Hopefully that will be to make sure you treat others as if this was your last day on Earth as opposed to building an earthquake shelter. In any event, if you're looking for a bit of entertainment, this film gives you what you're looking for.",1267488000,,5095,4.329140461215933

There are way too many narrow escapes. Every vehicle know to man is used to show the destructive forces just seconds away from killing Cusack and his family. First it's in a house, then it's in a car, an airplane, a motor home, another airplane, a cruise ship and a gigantic ark. When the writer ran out of ideas of what to use next he used a car coming out of the rear of an airplane just moments before the airplane crashed. It doesn't get more dreadful than this.

Even the special effects are non-impressive without a decent plot. There is nothing that I haven't already seen on the History Channel's Life Without People. I think this movie actual stole a couple of them, such as the Sistine Chapel falling apart and ripping through Michael Angleo's painting.

This movie is a stink bomb.

But like Y2K, there are people who fear that something post-apocalyptic will come on December 21, 2012 and if there is one director who is known for doing such films, Roland Emmerich (""Stargate"", ""Independence Day"" ""Godzilla"", ""The Patriot"", The Day After Tomorrow"", ""10,000 BC"") has had his share of working on a few significant titles.  Along with screenwriter Harald Kloser (""10,000 BC"") who is known for composing music for films, cinematographer Dean Semler (""xXx"", ""Bruce Almighty"", ""Get Smart"", ""Apocalypto"") and composer Thomas Wanker (""10,000 BC"", ""Dracula"", ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" TV series), the filmmaker would embark on his most ambitious film yet.

""2012"" is a film that focuses on the destruction of world and to create that means major CG work and a hefty production budget (which the film was budgeted at $200 million).  Despite receiving mixed to negative reviews for the film's focus on CG and action, the film did remarkably well in the worldwide box office, earning over $769 million.  And now, the film receives its Blu-ray release with a Three-Disc Special Edition (note: the slipcase and cover say Two-Disc Special Edition, but does come with a digital copy which is usually considered as a third disc).

VIDEO:

""2012"" looks absolute awesome in 1080p High Definition (aspect ratio is 2:40:1).  The film is just absolute colorful and vibrant during the outdoor scenes.  A lot of detail as we see the visual effects in full force during the surface cracks to full earthquakes revealing the destruction and chaos of the whole scenery.  Blacks are nice and deep, picture quality is detailed and sharp.  I did notice one segment in the beginning of the film with a bit of banding but for the most part, the film looks great and this is one of those films where you say that CG was well done.  The scenes with Jackson and family trying to escape a sinking Los Angeles is just absolutely awesome.  This film showcases the best in visual effects and because the film is CG-driven, is either going to impress people or turn people off.  But this is a film about the planet's devastation and for something at this magnitude, it has to look convincing and I believe Roland Emmerich and team really pulled it off

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

For audio, ""2012"" is incredible!  The lossless audio is presented in DTS-HD Master Audio and also comes with an English - Audio Description Track in Dolby Surround.  But this is one of those films that you can't just help gush over when it comes to audio.  From the moment you put the disc on to the end, this is audio that audiophiles dream of.  The lossless audio is absolute immersive as the whole soundscape of your room (especially if you have a solid 7.2 setup) features audio during the action driven scenes of the film.  And the good news, there is a ton of action and sounds from all over the place.  Well-planned audio and directing sounds to various channels.  How awesome is that?

From the sound of an elevator, an obstructed gear, to helicopters and airplanes flying, water rushing in, earthquakes, animals, insects and literally with the destruction of the planet, you can hear the lossless audio utilized well throughout center, front, surround and rear surround channels.  Also, great use of LFE and if anything, ""2012"" gives your audio setup a nice workout.  Personally, I found the audio to be quite phenomenal and hands down the best audio on a Blu-ray release for early 2010.

Subtitles are in English, English SDH and French.

NOTABLE EXTRAS:

""2012' also comes with a digital copy for PC & Mac Versions and PSP Version.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I enjoy disaster films and I enjoy Roland Emmerich's disaster films.  ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and ""Independence Day"" were films that captured your imagination, loaded with action and visual effects that there is always something happening onscreen.  When it comes to these disaster films, especially Emmerich disaster films, you come to see disaster and not a deep story and I think this is where critics had a problem with ""2012'.

Is it a deep, plot-driven film?  No.  Is it a romantic film?  No.

If anything, since Emmerich's ""Stargate"", you come to his films seeing how far he can take visual effects.  But for those who are expecting cinematic storytelling, this is not a film for you.  Where we seen James Cameron create a masterpiece with ""Avatar"" by combining storytelling and visual effects, Emmerich's disaster films is where disaster takes the front row.  How far can he make things look convincing and the peril of humanity. When it comes to disaster films, I suppose that one who has watched many of them including the 1958 film ""A Night to Remember"", the 1970 film ""Airport"", the 1972 film ""The Poseidon Adventure"",  the 1974 film ""Towering Inferno"" or even the 1997 film ""Titanic"" are disaster films at their best compared to a film such as ""When Time Ran Out..."" (1980).

Emmerich said he wanted to redo a modern ""Noah's Ark"" and in that sense, he did a great job.  To show how these cities and countries are destroyed has to look convincing and his visual effects crew pulls it off.  Yes, if you look at the film and expect anything serious, you are going to be disappointed.  The storyline is very farfetched as Jackson and his family are just a step, a few seconds away from their demise.  But if anyone has seen Emmerich's last films, isn't this usually the case? And at around 158 minutes, the film may seem too long for some viewers and some may feel that Emmerich was overdoing it by forcing too many action/disaster scenes on the viewer.  And I suppose, if I watched this film in the theater...maybe I would have felt that way.

But I have enjoyed Roland Emmerich's films, no matter how CG-driven they are.  I am not expecting anything monumental in cinematic storytelling, I watch his films simply as a popcorn flick in which visual effects takes a prime seat and see how far he is able to take things and in ""2012"", how much destruction he can pull off.  His disaster films are not for the serious minded and ""2012"" is not a film to expect anything deep in terms of character-driven storylines.  It's a film about humanity trying to survive apocalypse.  How does the government respond?  And sure, some may feel ""oh, we've seen that with `Deep Impact' or `Independence Day'""?  But, Emmerich and Harald Kloser do a good job of taking things in a different direction.

On Blu-ray, audiophiles will simply love how the lossless soundtrack sounds on their system.  Your room just envelops with audio and directions of the sounds carefully planned and to full effect.  This is what I love about seeing this film on BD.  The picture quality is also very well done and it really brought out the details of the destruction of the world.  And of course, a lot of content, especially for those who have interest in ""2012"" especially if they believe in the Mayan prophecy.

Overall, ""2012"" is an action/disaster film that features non-stop action and disaster.  For those who know what to expect from Roland Emmerich, will feel that ""2012' not only was this film his best disaster film (technically speaking), it is his best film on Blu-ray in terms of content, picture and audio quality.  This is a solid release and audiophiles, Emmerich fans and those who enjoyed ""2012"" will definitely enjoy.  ""2012"" on Blu-ray is definitely recommended!",1267488000,13,10155,4.854397204426325

They instead attacked on Sunday, December 7th and sank all nine. This error of history proved to doomsday predictors the Mayan system of astronomy was off by eight hundred years. In this futuristic movie called "" 2012 "" the end of the world as we know it should end on this date. Well except for the date, little if anything went wrong with the movie. Watching the film within the surround sound system of a Cina-Plex theater, the entire movie was an exciting, fantastic thrill-ride on steroids and had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. The acting, the assembled cast, the wonderful CGI-effects, the volcanic explosions, the crumbling earth, toppling buildings, world wide catastrophic flooding and doomsday happenings made this incredible movie a monumental visual success. The story as we see it has John Cusack playing writer Jackson Curtis, who predicted the world's end in a book entitle 'Farewell Atlantis.' Chiwetel Ejiofor plays Adrian Helmsley a scientific adviser to the president who having read the book has concluded the government should listen to him. Oliver Platt is Carl Anheuser, the Political adviser to the president and is superb in that role. Woody Harrelson plays Charlie Frost a radio host and doomsday prophet. Danny Glover is President Thomas Wilson who believes mankind waited too long to hear the truth. John Billingsley is wonderfully serious as Professor West. With a supreme effort in direction, this movie will easily become a Sci-Fi award winner. The special effects will also make this an all time Classic and a milestone for John Heard in his career.

3735346,4,B001OQCV2E,"I finally caught up with 2012 last night. Definitely a movie that needs to be watched with the brain disengaged.

I'd heard so many bad things about this film I was undecided whether I should even bother. I'm glad I did.

Certainly, it's not a classic, and it could never be said to be thoughtful. But the visuals are stunning, and do more than enough to compensate for the cardboard cut-out characters and the generous doses of sugary homilies.

It has been reviewed as a blockbuster, but in reality, this is a big-budget B movie. It reminded me of '50s classics, in particular When Worlds Collide, with which it shares several plot points. Seen as a film in this lineage it hits the spots it intended to hit.

Several things grated. There's only so many last-second escapes from certain death one man can make before it just gets silly. And the gung-ho American bias became just -too- much when they had the President stay behind at the White House but showed the British Queen making her escape with the corgis. Don't people know that the Royal Family famously chose to stay in London during the blitz in WW2?

The other thing that grates was the glib way that most of the world's population are killed. We're supposed to feel happy that a group of rich bastards have escaped and everybody else is dead?

But the visuals are what this movie is all about, and the destruction of California, then Yellowstone Park, are very well done. The swooping flight scenes are spectacular.

It needed more cutting, feeling about half an hour too long. Cut out some of the boring family business and they could have had a nice little disaster movie.

In general, I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. A guilty pleasure.",1266624000,,1712,4.608552631578948
3735347,5,B001OQCV2E,"I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. The political hype was kept to a minimum which was something I totally did not expect.

I enjoy a ridiculous end of the world movie, like Armageddon, but this one just followed the same event sequence 4 or 5 times over a couple hours.  Combine that with a lake of any character depth and being indifferent to whether they live or die and you have a rather boring movie despite it being an ""action packed blockbuster.""",1266364800,11,578,4.538461538461538

From being upset at how politicians and power brokers would actually use our tax money to save themselves, to thinking about what is coming in the real 2012, to it just being a well done and thrilling flick.

 Nobody was bored or thought it was not well executed. The acting fit the director's intended mood of not letting the disasters depress the audience too much. The effects were among the best ever done in cinema. The plot moved along at a brisk pace, and it did make you talk with those who saw it with you about a myriad of subjects and ideas.

 Questions of morality will come to mind but the director does not slant them to pander to emotion. Roland wants the viewer to contemplate what 'the right thing to do' may or not be in situations of high stress. You will be giving some thought as to how you might react to life and death situations.

 Less weighty but as important, was Woody Harrelson's portrayal of the Endtimes conspiracy expert. He wants the front row seat and gets it. I know, having comedy in a mass destruction film seems out of place, but it does work thanks to Woody's enthusiastic performance.

 In real life, the powered elite have and continue to build deep underground bases complete with high speed monorails to link them. They have evolved way beyond just secret bunkers.

The Mayans warned us thousands of years ago that 2012 would mark the end of the world as we know it.

They were right.

We just didn't listen.

Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), separated dad and small-time novelist, goes for the ride of his life when him and his family are caught up in the end of the world in the year 2012.

Dr. Satnam Tsurutani (Jimi Mistry) stumbled onto the truth of what was really happening to the Earth back in 2009. He showed his friend and colleague Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor), who in turn told Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt), who in turn told the President (Danny Glover). Plans were made. Research done. Even some advancements were made . . . but all for naught.

Catching wind from lunatic conspiracy theorist and radio broadcaster Charlie Frost (Woody Harrelson) that all the rich folks in the world plus those who would create the perfect gene pool were to be held up in a series of arks 'til the disasters ran their course, Jackson Curtis takes his family on an adventure to head them off and get onboard themselves.

Disaster after gigantic natural disaster ensues and the Curtis family narrowly escapes with their lives, that is, until they find the arks somewhere in China and learn that the powers that be have other plans in mind for humanity's survival.

If there was any one word that I would use to describe this film, it would be ""big."" Actually, not just ""big,"" but ""BIG!!!!"" HUGE! COLLASSAL! GIGANTIC and UTTERLY MASSIVE!

At the time of this review, this movie is still in the theatre. It definitely is a must-see-at-the-theatre movie. You need that big screen and surround sound to do it justice.

Everything is big scale in this one: the collapsing buildings, the giant earthquakes, the mountains crumbling, land folding over itself and falling a zillion feet to the Earth's core, the tsunamis, the dust cloudsthe list is endless, and everything is done HUGE. The whole time I was just sitting there with my mouth hanging open going, ""Whoa . . . whoa . . .""

Sure, there are a few convenient plot devices and a few impossible odds are overcome, but I went into this thing expecting a popcorn blockbuster with over-the-top special effects and that is exactly what I got. I left the theatre with a huge smile on my face.

1. The characters were dreadful, really who came up with them?

a woman, ex-husband , 2 kids and new husband yay original but they were so annoying, no real detail or any sort so no one (well I didn't) have any attachment to any of them.
The Russian guy was ok but again too little info on them. Too bland and boring.

2. Storyline (I don't mean the main part disaster movie so that explains itself) the storyline or lack of with the characters, I mean it was far too predictable I find most movies that way these days. Also a limo surviving all that ?
I don't want to give anyway any real major pieces but the end...

one word - Sad in a way that makes you want to turn it off (if watched again once all the major disasters have taken place)

One will have no trouble remembering its a movie and I actually laughed as earthquakes tore the place apart as no way anyone could take this film seriously.

I think if you are looking for entertainment it gives it to a point then well becomes Sad....

If you can see if as comical and throw all your own logic out the window then you might enjoy this movie.

This was the funniest, most unusual comedy I have seen in the last couple of years.",1263081600,,295,4.92

3735374,4,B001OQCV2E,"For my money this movie was more than worth it, not only did I see it once I saw it twice, I thought it was that good. I loved the way the movie took very little time to get started, the story line is set within the first 30 minutes and moves ahead to the action. I'm an action guy so this movie appealed to me on every level. I also liked the idea of how the movie presented some thought provoking questions such as how much is my or our lives worth, are all the things we spend our lives stressing over worth the headaches, and if faced in a battle against the forces of nature just what would my response be and how would the human race really act? Life is indeed precious and should not be taken for granted. This movie literally puts your emotions on the biggest roller coaster ride you can imagine. It really does makes one think and be more appreciative of life itself. Many may not believe that such events can happen but I'm not one to doubt history or the future for that matter. I think the dvd will be great simply because the movie is great but if you are one that didn't experience this movie on the big screen then you missed a treat. The acting was about has good as it could be for such a film as this. I would have liked to have seen a little more physical emotions displayed in the wake of disaster such as somebody getting knocked out or something because that to me is reality when faced with major calamities or catastrophies and I loved the idea that there was no time for anybody to find time to have sex like you see in so many movies when things are falling apart. So because of those reasons I thought it was a bit to cheesy because everybody will not be so civilized including in my opinion the president. The action is non stop once it starts so don't go any where because if you blink you will miss something and I for one definitely think that this is one of those movies that can be watched over and over again if you can stand the ride. Check it out, you won't be disappointed if you love action and great graphics any other expectations you may have about this movie will disappoint you.",1262822400,5,2121,4.188264058679707
3735375,3,B001OQCV2E,"I am a disaster movie junkie.  Really, I can't get enough of them.  An evening with popcorn and a good disaster movie sounds perfect to me.  And 2012 should have been the grandest disaster movie ever made.  Instead, 2012, while visually magnificent, leaves something to be desired.

2012 is the retelling of the Biblical flood story.  Scientists detect the coming of the greatest solar event in the history of man, and realize that the world as we know it will come to an end.  They tell the president and other heads of state, who, of course, keep it secret from the rest of the world.  In a grand attempt to save mankind, great arks are built, in secret.  But who will be selected to man these arks?  Will the human race survive?

As stated earlier, this movie is visually stunning.  The disaster effects are amazing and actually feel believable.  I loved California falling into the Pacific.  However, 2012 tries to be every cheesy disaster movie ever made, instead of being its own story.  There are remnants of Earthquake, Volcano, The Poseidon Adventure, Airport, Tidal Wave, Deep Impact, and pretty much every cheap disaster movie made for television by the Sci Fi, pardon me, SyFy channel.  It also borrows quite a bit of story line from the classic When Worlds Collide.  I really wanted 2012 to be its own story in its own right.  Instead, it was just a remix of, well, everything.  And seriously, John Cusack must be the luckiest man alive.  To survive disaster after disaster after close call gets a little monotonous.  The audience stops caring.  Especially since none of the characters are particularly engaging.

Overall, if you like high impact action/adventure with incredible visuals, you will like 2012.  If you want a little more story with your disasters, then this may not be a film for you.  It is flawed, clich&eacute;d, and leaves you wanting more.",1262736000,6,1872,4.793103448275862

Christ also says that ""the first will be last and the last will be first"" in the new world which Bob Dylan quotes him in his song ""The Times they are a changing.""  One other interesting tidbit of information is that it took the earth as a global civilization from about 6,000 years ago until the year 1900 to gather a certain amount of information. Then from 1900 to 1950 we doubled that amount of information. Then from 1950 to 1970 it doubled again. 1970 to 1980 it doubled again. As of 1994 NASA was seven years behind in just getting the information in their computers so they could use it. NASA predicted that by the year 2012 the information would be doubling every second!

3735379,1,B001OQCV2E,"Poor, horrific, sad, terrible, laughable, dimwitted and moronic are words that best describe this ""epic picture,"" ""2012"" but even that cannot fully articulate how incredibly awful and boring and abominable this movie is. From the over-dramatic made-for-TV performances to the lousy writing, editing and script to the hairball storyline that moves around faster than the people getting up to leave this movie, this is totally abysmal from the moment the huge ""2012"" title is imposed over the movie screen to the final credits.

It is hard to believe that anyone with connected brain cells would consider this utter effluent entertainment in even the most naive sense of the word. Because there is nothing fun, interesting or even educational about this movie. Instead, this movie, like a root canal, is holding on to that last painful nerve and simply won't let go. And who in the world wrote this screenplay, and why did he bother?

None of the actors are worth a hill of beans, but Woody Harrelson perhaps wins the award for the most foolish character thrown into this bag of mixed nuts. Yes, everyone does know his name, because he's made such a lousy name for himself, appearing in so many repugnant movies. But ""2012"" is without a doubt the proverbial notch on his bedpost that will banish Mr. Harrelson to infomercial hell.

And whose bright idea was it to cast John Cusack in the lead role? The man has about as much charm and charisma as a bag of broken glass shards. With all the money wasted on this turkey one would think the producers and studio big-shots would have paid a little more attention to who was staring in this picture.

As someone who not only paid for full admission but who also regrettably sat through this entire bomb I can wholeheartedly attest that the only pleasure I derived from this entire ordeal was leaving the multiplex. If you want to waste 2 hours of your time by being bored to sheer agony then by all means please watch this movie. Otherwise go scrub your kitchen floor, put away your dishes or re-grout your bathroom; your time will be much better spent and you'll be eons more thrilled, and amused.",1262217600,8,2141,4.7319034852546915
3735380,4,B001OQCV2E,"Emmerich films have been a bit uneven for me.  He created a whole universe with Stargate, but then twisted history a bit with Mel Gibson in The Patriot.  He created a great film in Independence Day and wiped out the World Trade Center before anyone thought about it, yet made a hammy, cheesy flick called Day After Tomorrow.  His 10,000 BC had potential, but there were too many plot holes.

2012, despite its viral marketing campaign (or because of it) hyped the film to include the Mayan predictions and how we were all gonna experience a disaster in 2012, yet the Mayan prediction stuff was maybe two minutes of the film.

But I digress.  John Cusak decently plays our divorced pal who has issues with his wife and new boyfriend (gosh, where have I seen that before?).  Little daughter bonding (War of the Worlds remake); bratty son who has no respect and little sympathy from the audience (Day the Earth Stood Still remake); only the rich folks will get on the arks (with one guy saying the mobs will be fine and the critics saying ""You think everyone will hold hands and sing Kumbaya?"" (great line by the way) When Worlds Collide from the 50s had a similar storyline).  Yet Emmerich puts it together!

Best scenes:  Driving a Chevy around giant fissures and through buckling parking garages.  Driving a van in a zig zag fashion, dodging fireballs; all the space scenes with sun flares!

Clearly Roland has watched the same films as me!  The film took a little bit of every science fiction plot I've seen from the Fifties onward, and yet made a joyride out of disaster films.

I knew I was in trouble when the kid in the beginning of the film was playing with a model of the Titanic (does Cameron get a kick-back?).

[Possible spoiler]  Little girl at the end, when everyone is safe, asks, ""Daddy, when are we going home?""
Damn, wasn't that kid paying attention??

But seriously:  California realistically sliding into the Pacific made me look at housing prices in Denver, CO.  Giant tsunamis and floods made me consider waterfront property on Mt. Everest!

Yes, my review is silly -- but it's silly because the film tries so hard to bust out of its cardboard characterization and become something never done before -- and it has been done before -- but damn, what style!

Thanks Emmerich.  Next time, give me more Mayans and less crazy radio guy in the mountains. (That was derivative too, if you know of the man who refused to evacuate during the Mt. St. Helens' eruption in 1980, but I digress)!

Must see in the theater to get the full effect like I did.

3735382,5,B001OQCV2E,"First and foremost I saw this movie about 5 weeks ago tomorrow and this was something that interested me for several reasons -- (1) it caught my eye, (2) the Destruction of L.A. {Hint: California sinks into the Ocean -- The BIG Earthquake Prediction floating out there}, and (3) great cast of actors assembled.

Know to a post back on about 15 November 2009 from Patrick ""Patrick"" in New York.  The Character connections were there staring you in the face.  Example: The U.S. President and his daughter have a discussion over the phone where he tells her in not so many words that the younger generation must survive.  Another character interaction is between Jacson Curtis (John Cusack) and Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor -- ""Serenity"").  There are tie-ins and the like but if aren't looking as this movie unfolds then what's the point of watching this movie.

As for the prophicies about 2012 out there in the world, which were woven into this film with great care, do I think something can happen, yes.  What that is, I don't know but what ever happens I will be with my family.

I do agree that there are funny scenes in this movie and the one that stood out for me was the limousine behind the 2 old ladies in their 1980's car (those 2 old ladies reminded me of the old Burger King/Wendy's commercial where one of the ladies say's ""Where's the beef?"").  As for the politics, greed, back door/behind the scenes dealings was something that needed to be shown in this because it is how our world operates and if anyone thinks the contrary I suggest that you open your eyes and take a good long look.  Yes, movies are flights of fantasy but there has always been real world issues woven into them that gets people thinking.

Of the comments I have read about this movie, I'd swear Sisckle and Ebert were still giving 2 Thumbs Down for good movies.  Why is it that when a great movie comes out people have to trash it and yet when a bad movie comes out people praise it?  That is something I could not and cannot understand to this very day.

However, this movie at least for me was great and I would suggest it to others.",1261872000,4,2125,4.485714285714286
3735393,4,B001OQCV2E,"While not quite a great achievement, I do think this is the best Disaster movie I've seen so far.  Please be note that I like disaster movies for the disasters, premise, and action, big arks for mankind, yadda yadda yadda.  Most definitely, definitely, NOT characters or profound messages.  As and added bonus, you get an end of the world premise.  While the ending is not quite the perfect disaster ending (if I could make my own disaster movie, I would have an in depth 2 hour non stop slideshow of the world getting destroyed), I mean, who cares about humanity anyway?  But even if there is, that's not really a movie anyway, just the fantasy of my poor sad mind (just kidding, I like people sometimes, I'm just neurotic.  Who isn't?).  Besides, having the master of disaster Roland Emmerich on board and the decision to cram everything in makes it a contender for my favorite disaster movie ever.  It's got everything you want from this movie, delivered Emmerich style.  Its not perfect, but it's still a fun piece of work that certainly doesn't deserve worst movie of the week and worst DVD release from the Razzies (UPDATE: Transformers wins three Razzies including worst picture.  Here's to the next ten viewings anyway!).

Roland Emmerich was once on my list of directors who inspire dislike, but now I think people sometimes need to get off his (and Bay's) jock.  While he made that piece of garbage Godzilla (and Bay made Pearl Harbor), I'm starting to think both Bay and Emmerich just have haters who mindless bash him (I think both have their share of abominations and mediocre blockbusters, though).  Granted, both directors get criticism, but even I admit that I almost just wanted to hop on the Bay hating bandwagon like everyone else.  I thought I would never love movies like this, and I still don't like most of the Jerry Bruckheimer vehicles and blockbusters, which I have seen (Top Gun, Pirates of the Carribean, Gone in 60 seconds).  But both directors proved me wrong with movies like Transformers, The Island, even ID4, and the ""mother of all disaster movies"" (according to Roger Ebert, but that could be bad based on your opinion of the world's most famous film critic), 2012.

LIke the title says, the movie is based, loosly on the self described prophecies of 2012.  At the same time, Roland Emmerich's OWN science (according to him, he takes the science of something and makes his own) is in the movie.  This time, it's something about neutrons or something.  Whatever?  The truth is, I think the science is kind of cool.  While it's not that accurate, it does have people really ________ up the earth's core because of some scientific meddling.  I don't care really, but the science hasn't been attacked as much as the Day After Tomorrow, which makes the premise a bit more forgiving.  Thats what makes the plot work more, is that it wasn't near the inaccuracy that Day AFter Tomorrow had in mind.  Is it Scientifically Inaccurate?  Probably.  But I won't be seeing much complaints for the scientific community as Armageddon and Day after TOmorrow had, so the premise is fine.  Besides, something like the end of the world allows for less than the Day after Tomorrow ever had.  That's my only argument as to why this movie is more believable.  After all, suspension of Disbelief is fine, but suspension of logic and science is way less forgiving in my opinion.  It features more of the first, and a forgivable amount of the last two.  Which makes the whole movie enjoyable.

Characters and dialogue are a bit of a weakness as usual for an Emmerich film, as its not that bad but not that great either.  While the cast in this doesn't create a plethora of memorable characters that will be on the same boat as the characters from Terminator 2, Star Wars, (were talking big blockbusters here), Alien, etc. I think it's one of his better casts, especially compared to Godzilla featuring a less than stellar cast.  Here, its not so bad.  Many of these actors were not well known to me beforehand, but it features of a mix of not annoying no-names and some actors who are well known and not annoying (at least for me).  Having the kick @$$ John Cusack on board helps a lot, as he is much cooler than Jeff Goldblum, Matthew Broderick, and Dennis Quiad combined (at least in my opinion).  Woody Harrelson gives a by the books performance, but I found that it didn't really matter much anyway when he adds an element to the premise.  After all, it would be interesting to know about the theories before it happens.  Most of the other characters are generic but likeable enough to be attractive cardboard cutouts.  IF not, they serve the plot at least.  The other memorable character is Adrian, probably the only character that doesn't have as much cardboard tendencies.  Though I don't think I'll remember him like I do when it comes to Sam Witwicky.

As for the dialogue, it's not that cheesy or bad as people make it out to be, though still cliche, some of the lines are fun, but forgiving for the most part (they work fine).  Well, at least until those speeches come along.  I don't care if it's the end of the world, besides the presidential speech to everybody, every two minute dialogue speech between two or more characters is beyond annoying, particullary the emotional scenes where they confess their love towards each other.  I don't have a total aversion to sentimental material (Saving Private Ryan is watchable without one hint of snickering from me) but it's just so annoying here.  Cliched, sappy, trite, maudlin, and BORING, they really need to be cut out.  The emotional scenes need to be rewritten, because they are my main complaints about the movie.  Every time they are on screen, I skip it or lapse out.

And the other weakness is the family aspect.  Sorry Cusack, I root for you in the end, but (this is personal preference, got it?) I don't care about your family life.  Lucky me though, they don't spend that much time with developing it.  Thanks god this movie is two and half hours long (not counting credits).  Thanks to the chapter skip that lets me skip many of the lame speeches and family scenes (not really thanks to dialogue for the family scenes, just a lack of care.  Emmerich did not make me care).  Everything else is filled with the reaction towards the end of the world, which is what it should be doing after all.  I want this one to run and not just give me disaster after disaster.  Which it does by the way.

Ah yes, the movie's most virtuous moments.  At it's best, the movie is a glorious end of the world story with intriguing reactions that make the scenario seem alive, and great set pieces galore ranging from short to roughly 8 minutes.  The Disaster sequences are jaw dropping thrill rides.  The most well known sequence is the LA sequence, and it's a ________ amazing sequence, pitting you literally in the brink of, well, driving a limo on the streets of California while the whole state is crumpling and sinking into the ocean. This movie has been noted by many people for succeeding by being the ultimate disaster movie, and this one has so much disaster crammed into it.  Earthquakes, tsunamis, the earth cracking, meterors, volcanos, and flooding all make it's way into the chaos, and the results make for roughly the best disaster sequences I've seen.  Unlike Bay, who uses a very frentic, cutting style who almost never leaves the camera steady, Emmerich is different because he is never chaotic with the camera.  All the chaos IS the action, not the camera itself along with the action on screen.  And it kicks @$$!

So I'm going to have to say this is the best Disaster movie I've seen, thanks to the fact it crams everything in, features Emmerich at the helm, and has the technology and CGI to make a great vision of the end of the world.  As far as I'm concerned, it may get dethroned if Stephen Sommers outdoes it with the remake of When World's Collide (a very similar premise and features multiple disasters), an action director known for non stop action and movies like the Mummy, and GI Joe: Rise of the Cobra.  But until it does, this is my favorite disaster movie.  Those who like disaster movies for the disaster aspect will find a lot to like here.  If not, then well, you can just go away.",1261440000,3,8282,4.643986254295533
3735394,4,B001OQCV2E,"I came in knowing it's Roland Emmerich and my friend had said to me before I watched the movie that he was on the edge of his seat most of the time. I was still not prepared. Emmerich laid out the characters, made them loveable enough and made the audience hang on to them every step of the way with the exception of a few blatant throw aways. With these world disaster movies, Emmerich has taken on the challenge of representing the globe and its destruction in one movie. It's still a long way before anyone can really represent the crumbling of the physical world and one family's survival in one movie, but Emmerich is probably the closest I've seen in doing so. Traveling the world with leaders, researchers and families through planes and automobiles through the fickle human urban landscape air and sea, Emmerich takes us on a thrill ride scarier and more beautiful than anything ever imagined yet.",1261440000,3,905,4.6625
3735395,4,B001OQCV2E,"Were there flaws? Yes, as some of the other reviewers have noted, but this movie was highly entertaining, and very exciting through much of it. In fact, though the movie was long, I was never bored. There were parts of the story line that were totally unrealistic. Yet I made the decision to ignore that and just enjoy the flick. And I did. It's entertainment, and I was very entertained.

As another reviewer mentioned, the special effects sequences were worth the price of admission. I'm not sure why people put down special effects movies. I agree that there must be more to a film than that, but this one did have depth. The story showed complicated relationships being worked out, forgiveness, people maturing and taking responsibility, parental love and devotion, people fighting for what's right and a lot more. It also showed us the darker side of human nature as well. It was interesting.

I don't really believe that this exact situation is going to happen like this, and I don't believe that if this did happen, it would go down like this. And I don't really believe that John Cusack's character could have survived most of what his character pulled through. But who cares.

3735396,1,B001OQCV2E,"I seriously thought about posting a one or two word review of this cinematic excrement.  After all, why waste more energy on this epic piece of trash?  It didn't even meet my minimum criteria for brainless popcorn flicks.  It wasn't even fun.  And if you can't make a movie about the destruction of humanity fun, what good are you as a director?  Emmerich's other films are stupid beyond words, but they at least were marginally entertaining.  As I squirmed restlessly through 2012, my thoughts shifted back and forth between two competing, frightening notions. First, I wondered whether Roland Emmerich and his writers were monumentally overpaid dunces.  At some level, the film has the feel of an earnest effort by folks who try to seem smart, but aren't.  For example, the ham-handed and inept insertion the Buddhist parable of the overflowing cup suggested dimwits who were desperate to appear intelligent, and might even have (falsely) fancied themselves as smart.  Second, and more chillingly, I wondered whether the movie was the product of careful marketing to a ""common man idiot"" from whom hundreds of millions of dollars could be wrested. Maybe it's both.

As I left the theater, I wondered whether 2012 would push any alien overlords that might be looking in on mankind to pull the plug on our empty civilization. There would be at least one silver lining: no more movies like this one.",1261094400,15,1398,4.935897435897436

STARRING: John Cusack, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Oliver Platt, Amanda Peet, Thandie Newton, Thomas McCarthy, Danny Glover, Liam James, Morgan Lily and Woody Harrelson

WRITTEN BY: Roland Emmerich and Harold Kloser

DIRECTED BY: Roland Emmerich

Rated: PG - 13
Genre: Action
Release Date: 13 November 2009

If there was ever a sucker for a movie full of stuff being destroyed, it's me baby. I've been a huge fan of writer and director Roland Emmerich's, aka `The Master of Disaster', ever since he blew up the White House in Independence Day. Godzilla was amazing, The Day After Tomorrow was terrific and without a doubt his greatest film of all was The Patriot. You know that awesome flick with Mel Gibson that couldn't be any different from the three films I just named previously; yeah, that one. Same dude directed it.

So what did I think of 2012? I only have two complaints about the film. I wanted more stuff getting blown to hell and I wanted more John Cusack. Other than that, it was great.

But that's just because I'm such a dork for disaster in films and an insanely huge fan of Mr. Cusack. The movie is good and most people will be more than satisfied. You will definitely get your money's worth, at well over two hours of our beloved planet meeting its demise.

""You've been warned"", the tagline screams to us. And that we have. We have been warned for God only knows how many years by the Mayans, that on the 21st of December in 2012, Earth will be no more. This is a fact in the film and in life (that we have been warned, not that it will happen).

It is also a fact, based on the research I have gathered from the internet, that on the 21st day of December in 2012, the sun will be perfectly positioned in a way that only happens every so however many thousands of years and that there will be `some' side effects on earth.

Scientists do not necessarily say that the world will end, but that there will be a polar shift of sorts. Take that for what it's worth to you. Do I think that the world will end on that day? No, I do not. There are way too many movies to be made about the end of the world and I can't wait to hear the rumor of the next date in which the earth will end. Can you?

In the film, we learn early on that scientists have discovered a situation involving our sun, in 2009; that situation being the end of the world, of course. Then we move pretty quickly through 2010 and 2011 until we arrive in late 2012.

The government immediately set a plan in action, back in 2009; their plan? They will charge the wealthiest people in the world a hefty price for a seat on one of many expensive ships that will travel them to safety. The price one must pay for life after 2012, should they be able to afford it; one Billion Euros. This money of course is all paid in advance and is used to construct the massive ships. Oh, and the government isn't releasing any of this to the press either.

I have heard a lot of people complain about the over-use of comedy in the film. I didn't find there to be too much but I did not enjoy the stab at Arnold Schwarzenegger. It was too cheesy to be funny; the guy sounded nothing like Arnold. It put a bad taste in my mouth mid-movie, due to its poor placement as far as pace is concerned. And I'm not sure if they were trying to be funny, but when they show the Mona Lisa painting, it's about four times larger than the actual painting in real life. Maybe no-one working on the set that day had ever been to the Louvre.

Like in so many of Emmerich's films, there is a single father with a lot of personal issues to deal with throughout the course of the film; all while battling whatever catastrophic event is occurring simultaneously. This time his name is Jackson Curtis and he is played by the brilliant John Cusack.

Jackson is a writer slash limo driver. He has the kids for the weekend as is taking them from their home in Manhattan Beach California to Yellowstone National Park to go camping. He's recently separated from his wife Kate (Amanda Peet) who now lives with her goofball boyfriend who's a rich doctor. Is it starting to feel like a big Hollywood movie yet?

When they get to Yellowstone they run into the wild and crazy disc-jockey Charlie, played beautifully by none other than Woody Harrelson. Woody goes all out here. He embodies every clich and stereotype of the American anti-government hippie, save for a joint in his hand surprisingly enough. He really looks off his rocker here. Having seen him recently in Management and Zombieland, I can tell you that he lost a lot of weight to play this government-paranoid whack-job.

Woody's character Charlie fills Jackson and us in on his wild conspiracy theory; both through a series of uncontrolled obnoxious fits of paranoia and a half-baked homemade video he has downloaded to his computer.

Meanwhile back in California and elsewhere in the world, things start heating up. Mom panics and demands Jackson bring the kids home early.

He does and then heads off to work. One of his clients is a rich Russian who bought several tickets to one of the ships. Jackson is dropping off the man's kids at the airport and this business with `the only way to survive being on one of these ships' is explained very quickly to him and then just like that, he is convinced that Charlie was onto something.

I struggled with the reality of this for about a second and then I let the amazing action that followed, take all useless demands for plot point believability and erase them from my brain.

Jackson barely has time to rescue his family from their home before the entire greater Los Angeles area begins to crumble to dust.

I thought that Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen was a shoe-in for the Oscar for special effects this year. However, 2012 will definitely be giving it a run for its money. This entire sequence will leave you breathless. The special effects during their escape of L.A. are astonishing; probably the best I have ever seen. No one could have made it any more believable without it actually being real. Just when you think there couldn't possibly be any more, there is; lots more. Emmerich just keeps hammering the disaster down our throats.

From there it just keeps getting worse; Las Vegas - gone; Washington D.C - done; The Vatican in Rome - not anymore. Emmerich doesn't just show you the end of the world; he makes sure you live through it with his characters. It was an absolute blast!

 As if all of this action and mayhem wasn't enough, you actually get very good acting sprinkled through it as well.

Danny Glover is the U.S. President and Oliver Platt is his right hand man; two knock-out performances. Thandie Newton is Danny Glover's daughter and she did a great job too.

Next to Cusack, the best acting in the film goes to the much underrated Chiwetel Ejiofor. This guy is going places with his career. He was incredible and has such a kind spirit about him. He's the smart scientist named Adrian, who figures out most of what's going on and has to deliver the news to the President.

I Know I have commented on the action repeatedly, but towards the end of the movie - it just stops. There is no huge action-filled climax. The end is entertaining, don't get me wrong, but it plays out much more like a thriller than a disaster flick. It just seemed to drag on way too long for me and before I knew it, the movie was over. In my opinion, the climax was seeing L.A. being taken out.",1260921600,,7444,4.453676470588236

John Cusack did a weak job with his character...not strong enough.  Some of the special effects are also overkill with several buildings collapsing one after another, yet the characters amazingly bypass every one of them while others are crushed.  Overall, I'll probably purchase the movie for the special effects, but certainly not the weak story line.",1260835200,,522,5.023255813953488

3735400,1,B001OQCV2E,"Here we are again. Over hyped Hollywood garbage filled with special effects trying to bank on irrational fears of the masses. I guess I would compare this movie to: ""The Blair Witch Project"" and ""Paranormal Activity."" What do all of these movies have in common? A crazy internet marketing scheme designed to fool people into believing the events are real and inspiring a more moving theatre going experience. This is ok for the two movies I mentioned because they just stole your money and your time....except for Paranormal Activity which was actually pretty good. However, in the case of ""2012,"" they're adding fuel to the fire of irrational ignorant masses. There were actually reports of suicides and other crimes due to people's fears of the 2012 events; many of them as a direct result of the propaganda associated with this film. I'm really sick of all the lies about global warming and other dooms day predictions pouring into the ""real"" news and the heads of gullible people. Thanks to the hype of this movie, I had to hear about 3 idiots a week try to explain to me the inevitable doom that would come in 2012. Not to mention that it reinforces the pathetic claims of various religious groups and allows them to continue their unwarranted solicitation at my house.

I can't believe that Cusack signed on for this movie; he must really be getting desperate for funds. I found his performance to be the only salvageable part of the movie, but not enough for me to get passed the masquerade of half wits trying to act and special effects taking the place of a good plot. Oh wow, we're outrunning an earthquake...ehhh.

If you like pointless action movies with a ton of special effects, then maybe you can enjoy this movie, but I for one am sick of Hollywood passing of garbage with irresponsible advertising campaigns.

Didn't anybody have an imagination beyond FX? Didn't John Cusack used to be able to act? Or is he Botoxed beyond facial expressions now?",1260662400,3,827,4.79020979020979

In general, I can stop my mind from working too critically and enjoy a movie if its made for nothing more than the pretty colors and bright flashes, which 2012 clearly is.  I couldn't do it for this colossal waste of time, energy and oxygen.

Would you like to spend the better part of three hours watching the Apocalypse chase down John Cusack and his family?  (Spoiler alert:  No matter where they go, its lurking just a step behind...)  And I'm not talking witty, ironic John Cusack from Say Anything or Grosse Point Blank.  No, this is cheesy, vapid, fill-in-the-empty-starring-role Cusack.  (Think Con-Air.)  The sad part is that, as good an actor as he is, he couldn't seem to muster up the drunken stupor to even pretend he could see the things that were ""happening"" around him.  He clearly couldn't and neither could anyone else.  For all the reactions you get, its evident that all they can see are massive blue screens.  ""Alright everyone, give me stunned and shocked as you watch the world around you blow up!"" calls the director.  The actors give him blank stares.  Chilling.

The only thing that gave this movie even the hollow shadow of entertainment was Woody Harrelson, playing an amusing Art Bell type character.  His quixotic radio personality/conspiracy nut is funny for about 2 minutes.

3735406,4,B001OQCV2E,"2012: Quick Review

Grade: B-

In director Roland Emmerich's new film 2012, he manages to cram nealy every way possible to destroy our world. John Cusack plays a worried father trying to save his ex-wife and children while the world blows up--whether it be by earthquakes, tsunami's, or mega volcanoes--somehow always behind them. If their's one thing I can't stress enough about 2012, it's that it throws all sense of plausibility out the door. Cusack and co. seem to be either invincable or immpossibly lucky, unlike the other 5 billion that perish in the movie. The special effects are fantastic though, and you can see early on in the movie that the 100 million+ spent on the CGI were worth every penny. Sadly that's the best part about the movie--the script packs every cliche possible into it. And yet it seems we have even more coming our way, even after we've left the theatres--a T.V. series named ""2013"", which is about the aftermath of 2012, is already in production.",1260489600,,978,4.781065088757397

The Sears Tower crumble, the head & the arm of the Statue of Liberty fall off etc. etc. That's  Life Without People, on tv. Lots of that sort of thing in 2012. The Capitol falls down, Christ The Redeemer in Rio explodes, Californis slides into the Pacific etc. etc. The poles are shifting, remaking the continents. Mount Everest makes a cameo appearence. The story in between, nothing special. Arks are being built in China to save our species. The probelm is that those that have a seats apparently don't want to go. Danny Glover plays a rather pious & stupid president. He decides to die. So does his daughter. But she gets a seat anyway to make nice with the young  neurotic scientist, played by Chiwetel Ejiafor. He is racked with guilt for living. Then there is John Cusack, the novelist, his estranged wife with new tits, (Amanda Peel), their kids & her new boyfriend, the plastic surgeon. Let's throw in a rich, evil Russian & his bimbo, also with new tits. There is of course a cast of billions who do want to get on the ark. But the special effects are the thing. I'd say award winning.

3735408,4,B001OQCV2E,"Overall, great, I'll give it an 8. It's certainly worth watching. Sadly a few strategic mistakes on the part of the director and writer watered the movie down.

The destruction scenes are awe-inspiring. I actually got goose-bumps watching some of it, a first for this 50 year old viewer. The scope, complexity, imagination, and excellence. I'm an expert viewer but to me it looked really realistic, I didn't see anything I could recognize as computer animation even though I know that's mostly what it was. Had I been the producer and the creative team came to me with a plan for what they wanted to do I would have thrown them out of my office: ""ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND? Stop wasting time and put something down that we actually have a chance of completing in less than 10 years."" Also at least one of the destruction scenes (the one were they drove through a sky-scraper) featured various sight-gags and funny content that I enjoyed and laughed out loud. However this came at the expense of lightening the tone of a scene in which thousands of people are supposedly dying.

The soundtrack was awesomely detailed, at least at first. During the scene were Cusack showed up at his ex-wife's house and then an earthquake hit, there were all sorts of interesting sounds happening and they sounded good and clear. One neat sound was timber creaking as the house gave way. In later scenes I did not notice that detail.

A surprise was the many big stars. Danny Glover, John Cusack (with less and even no (!) guy-liner this time), Oliver Platt, and Woody Harrelson.

Woody Harrelson's character provided the comic relief and it was good. It came across well and also funny, but they avoided the mistake of making him annoying or too silly, also he moved the plot along. It was good but it could have been funnier. It would not have been as much fun with an unknown actor, so Woody carried the character more than the dialog.

The drama was good but not great so this movie could not have ever made it to 10 status. A little trite and pedantic during the speech section near the end.

No, I repeat NO Mayan content. Only a brief mention and one watermarked shot of the Mayan city of Tikal. They mangled the word ""Quich."" It's pronounced key-TCHAY (like touch but it's a hard ch like tch, not a soft one like sh), they pronounced it ""quiche"" as in ""I'll have the quiche Lorraine, please."" That was unbelievable. They also mispronounced Tikal, which is pronounced Tee-KAHL. I forget what they said but it was something ridiculous like ""tickle."" Anyway it doesn't matter because other than that one line of dialog you could watch the entire movie and never realize that Mayans were involved. I think this was an odd and poor choice. Other movies like ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" ""Star Gate,"" ""The Da Vinci Code,"" and ""National Treasure"" make good drama with quasi-factual archeological content. In this case there was some real and really interesting factual content on which to draw but they passed. The movie would have been a large notch more worthwhile had they thrown in some tidbits. A little hieroglyphics here, a little pyramid skulking there, a few fascinating facts about ""El Gran Jaguar"" (the main pyramid in Tikal) or ""El Mirador"" (possibly the world's largest pyramid, located in Northern Guatemala), it could have been done without bogging the movie down.

The tone was too light. I mean the world is ending, millions of people are dying, but the overall tone was light and a little upbeat, focusing on the few that were making it out alive. In particular, the scenes in the plane were way too light, especially Cusack's ex-wife. They would just barley make it out with their lives with the world crumbling right beneath them and entire cities sinking into the ocean, and then once air-born she would look up almost smiling and just go on with her dialog like nothing had happened. It was almost like ""Oh wow, I'm glad that's over. We made it! Is my hair mussed? Oh well, what's next? Is it lunch time yet?"" For me those lines were so misplaced that it was a distraction.

The biggest strategic mistake of the director was evenly spacing the action out over the entire movie. It was like drama-action-drama-action-drama-action. The voltage varied constantly throughout from high voltage action back to low-voltage talking heads. The early action scenes had major impact on me, later ones had a ""more-of-the-same"" effect and my reaction was ""Oh, we have to do more action now? Ho-hum, OK, let's get it over with."" The movie would have been much better if they had adopted a more conventional pacing, put most of the drama and character development up front, then launch into the action and continually build to the climax. Had they done it this way the movie might have been a 9, but without a better dramatic story it still would not have been a 10.

3735409,3,B001OQCV2E,"While twenty minutes too long at 158 minutes, make no mistake that 2012 is an entertaining movie.  VERY entertaining.  It is also often quite bad or deeply silly.  (To say nothing of asking you to kick back and enjoy the most thorough destruction of the earth yet brought to the disaster movie genre...I will speak no more of this ""moral quandary.""  It's a movie, after all.)

In 2012, we are asked to believe that in accordance to a prediction the Mayans made ages ago, the earth will end on 12/21/2012.  Basically, huge solar flares will send super crazy neutrinos towards earth, and they will burrow themselves deep under the crust of the earth, superheating the ""glue"" that holds our crust more or less in place.  Continents will shift thousands of miles, causing earthquakes and tsunamis never dreamed of in our worst nightmares.

Naturally, the governments of the world find out about this just a few years before it is to occur, and of course, they begin to devise a scheme involving a gigantic construction project that will enable a relatively few humans ride out the cataclysm.  And what do you suppose the best way to get safe transfer might be?  Good genetics?  A brilliant mind?  A skill set that will be critical to rebuilding the race?  NOPE.  It's one billion dollars.  This, of course, makes sense, because in the new economy, our old money will be really important.

Our journey through this epic disaster is, of course, charted by following a ""typical American family"" as they heroically outrun huge volcanoes, collapsing runways and the spectacle of millions of people being killed.  The family is nominally headed by John Cusack, a once successful writer now working as a limo driver.  He's divorced and has a strained relationship with his son, but a better one with his daughter.  They're both about 11 or 12, I would guess.  His ex is Amanda Peet, who is close to making it permanent with her new boyfriend, a physician and pilot trainee.  These 5 get just a little bit more notice about everything getting ready to hit the fan, and embark on a series of close escapes across the globe, as they try to make it to safety.

Many silly things happen along the way...but there are also some jaw dropping scenes of global destruction.  Perhaps the best comes relatively early in the film, as Cusack and Co. escape from an LA that is literally falling off the edge of the earth.  The sequence features special effects that are flat-out incredible.  While every single instant of this lengthy sequence might not be 100% realistic, it is a spectacle not equaled in this sort of film.  It made me gasping and laughing in appreciation.  Watching skyscrapers collapse and fall into each other is jaw-dropping (and it doesn't evoke thoughts of terrorist acts).  It's over the top...but that's exactly what is needed.

Eventually the film somewhat collapses under the weight of all the characters they've tried to make us care about.  It begins to resemble POSEIDEN...a cast of generic characters struggling to keep from drowning...some will live, some will die.  Chances are you can guess exactly who will meet which fate.  And there's even a dog we're meant to be concerned about...while literally billions of people are being killed.

So the film is a series of breathtaking acts of special effects.  It's almost worth it for that alone.  And we have some fine actors doing some excellent slumming.  Oliver Platt and the always excellent Chiwetel Ejiofor play opposing sides in the President's staff.  Platt, no surprise, is the greedy, sneaky ""bad guy"" and Ejiofor is the idealist geologist.  Both actors are agreeably engaging in their roles.  Cusack does what Cusack does...and if you like him, you'll like him in this part.  Amanda Peet always makes things interesting, even when she has nothing to do.  Woody Harrellson shows up in a small, but key, role...he's quite over-the-top...and some will love him for it.  I found him a bit annoying myself.  Less successful are Danny Glover, as the President...utterly lacking the gravitas of, oh, let's say Morgan Freeman in DEEP IMPACT.  And as his daughter, one of the more annoying actresses on the face of the earth, Thandie Newton.  Here she manages to make almost no impression...which is actually a step up for her.

So, I hope you get the idea that this is not a great film, but if you understand the enjoyments a film like this CAN bring, I believe you'll be entertained.  If you insist on dwelling on illogic in plots...then you'll have a field day.  But I'd recommend just kicking back and letting the great work of the special effects teams sweep you away.",1260144000,,4631,4.817258883248731
3735410,5,B001OQCV2E,"Quite a few ""end of the world"" movies have been done in recent years and ""2012"" rises above them all, mainly due to breath-taking CGI work, good and believable performance of the cast and moving personal stories.

The premise of the film is the global catastrophe the Mayan calendar predicts on December 12, 2012. Signs of the impending disaster appear already in 2009 and are brought to the awareness of several head of states worldwide. Led by the U.S. government, they form a plan to deal with the upcoming calamity - and the way they choose to react is one of the most surprising, interesting aspects of the film that is fully disclosed only in its last part. As ""Judgment-day"" comes to a close the story veers to focus also on the getaway of American, Russian and Tibetan families and highlights acts of unselfishness and personal bravery in the wake of the self destructing earth.

It is recommended to watch ""2012"" in the theater in order to experience the full extent of the amazing special effects of mayhem and devastation that are abundant throughout the film.",1260144000,2,1071,4.752688172043011
3735411,3,B001OQCV2E,"According to Roland Emmerich-directed ""2012,"" the world as we know it will end with a big bang. You know, this is nothing surprising because ""2012"" is helmed by the director responsible for ""Independence Day"" and ""Godzilla."" Like the space alien invasion and the hugest lizard in NYC he once depicted, Roland Emmerich's new film is such a bombastic, effect-ridden disaster film that ignores any logical narrative structures.

Actually, that is not exactly a bad thing. Certainly ""2012"" delivers the goods and does what it sets out to do. We get what we expect from so-called disaster movies and Roland Emmerich doesn't disappoint us on that score. You will see familiar landmarks and buildings, and even the whole city, collapsing into the ground and the ocean. That is impressive, surely, though no one in the film really explains the mechanism of this catastrophe.

We are to follow the story of two main characters: one ordinary man Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), trying to save his family no matter it takes; and Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a scientist who predicted the event, struggling to retain the humanity in the face of the disaster. Their acting is not bad, but their characters (and most supports) remain one-dimensional at best.

But what really disappointed me is the dullness of the film, which is 30 minutes too long. I know this is not a nature documentary and I don't expect scientific accuracy, but when the story starts to look absurd, or (worse) predicable, something is definitely wrong. You guess who will survive or not, and in most cases your guess is right. Moreover, the film's big actions are amazing at first, but soon they start to look repetitious. Also, though I can't say in what way, the final chapter is a real letdown.

You don't have to take the film too seriously. But when you know there is something in the film that could be turned into something better, maybe you have to take it seriously. What will the government do if they know there is no chance of survival for most of the people? What will a scientist do? The film raises these intriguing questions only half-heartedly, content with the big-budget special effects. OK, this is Roland Emmerich and I should have known that.",1259884800,,2229,4.87335092348285
3735412,2,B001OQCV2E,"Shockingly, ""2012"", the new film from Roland Emmerich (""Independence Day"", ""The Day After Tomorrow"") is getting some good reviews. I just don't get it. Sure, the special effects are great, but the story is so unbelievable, so filled with cliches and so preposterous it is impossible to take seriously.

Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), the writer of a single Science Fiction novel selling about 500 copies, now works as a limo driver as he waits for the next book to materialize. He arrives at his ex-wife Kate's (Amanda Peet) house to pick up their two kids, Noah and Lily (Liam James and Morgan Lilly). Before they leave, Kate makes sure that Jackson knows their daughter must still wear these pull up training pants to bed. ""She still wets the bed at seven?"" he asks her. They drive off for a weekend of camping in Yellowstone and stumble across an area fenced off by the army. Jackson doesn't pay any attention to the signs and has his kids climb over the fence...

As I sat in the audience, I woke up because I heard a loud noise that I didn't sense was coming from the film. When I opened my eyes, I realized the sound was my snoring. I was able to fall asleep during one of the loudest, most bombastic films I have ever seen because the narrative is so preposterous and the characters are so cliched.

Long story short, a scientist (Chiwetel Ejiofor) learns the Earth's core is heating up because of rays from the sun. His data indicates that the Earth as we know it will come to an end in 2012. He takes this information to the White House Chief of Staff (Oliver Platt). Quickly for politicians, the President (Danny Glover) and other members of the G-8 set a plan into motion to save as much of Earth as they can. They begin a top-secret building project in the Himalayas. Strange, secretive men go around selling transport to the world's rich for $1 billion Euros per person. The President's daughter (Thandie Newton) travels the globe to save the ""best"" artworks. John Cusack runs into a rogue radio broadcaster (Woody Harrelson), a crazy guy broadcasting from his Winnebago in Yellowstone who claims he knows what is going on. Then, earthquakes begin to hit Los Angeles. Cusack puts two and two together and races to Kate's house to get them to safety. If he had stopped at a Starbucks, he wouldn't make it because the streets begin to buckle, freeways collapse and the skyscrapers of Los Angeles begin to topple. But Cusack and family make it out of Los Angeles to the next stop, Las Vegas. There, Emmerich and his team get to demolish a lot of the signature Las Vegas hotels. Then, they get to blow up and destroy various Washington landmarks. Then, the world.

One thing I found odd was that the destruction of the world isn't tied into global waste and global warming, much like ""The Day After Tomorrow"". The cause of the Earth's core overheating is solar flares. In other words, there is nothing anyone can do to stop it. So there is no message to the film. I guess Hollywood has realized that global warming in a fiction film doesn't lead to seat warming by ticket-buying patrons. ""The Happening"" ('the wind is out to get us"") was a big dud. It seems like I vaguely recall another film with global warming as the protagonist, but I can't quite place my finger on the title because it wasn't bad enough or good enough to remember. So Emmerich uses a device that no one can fix. The only solution is to try to save as many people as possible and as many resources as possible. When they can, they will start to rebuild.

As Cusack drives his limo through the buckling streets of Los Angeles, the awkward vehicle does a remarkably good job of evading the destruction occurring all around them. When they make it to the Santa Monica airport, Kate's new husband has to fly the prop plane quickly, putting to use his rudimentary skills as they attempt to evade the eroding runway. As they fly away, Emmerich treats us to a view of Los Angeles sliding into the sea. For some reason, they head to Vegas next. I really think this is a ploy to allow the filmmakers to blow up more recognizable landmarks. When you learn the full story, Vegas doesn't make sense.

In fact, Curtis picks his kids up in Los Angeles, in his limo, and is driving the same limo when they are camping in Yellowstone, a couple of states away. When the chaos begins, Kate demands they return and they seem to get back early the next morning. Can you really drive from Yellowstone to Los Angeles in such a short time? Maybe, but it seems unlikely.

The special effects are good, make no mistake about that. I was particularly impressed when a fault line destroys a Los Angeles supermarket. The smaller scale makes it seem more interesting and believable. But we wouldn't expect anything else from Emmerich would we? He clearly relishes recreating landmarks with as much attention to detail as possible only so he can destroy them. This happens in all of his films (except for ""10,000 BC"" which doesn't have any) and he clearly acts like a kid in a candy shop.

But Emmerich is only an okay storyteller. He seems very reliant on the notion of good and bad. John Cusack is a good father, who really cares for his kids and still loves his ex-wife. To get this point across, and hit us over the head with it, Cusack works for a shady Russian Billionaire with two bratty twins and a freshly implanted bimbo girlfriend complete with a yappy little expensive dog. Chiwetel Ejiofor plays a scientist who first learns of the problem. He wants and needs to do everything he possibly can to save mankind. To get this point across, his main liaison with the White House is the Chief of Staff (Platt) who doesn't bother to save his aging mother from the destruction. And there are more examples like this. Thankfully, Emmerich doesn't play favorites when killing people off. Both good and bad people die.

These extreme examples of good and bad wouldn't be so egregious if there were any thing else. There are no characters with a little of both. Ejiofor is friends with an Indian scientist (who first uncovers the problem in an old Indian mine). He promises to get help for his friend, to help evacuate him and bring him to safety. The Indian scientist (played by Jimi Mistry, a recognizable actor who was in ""RockNRolla"" among many other films) and Ejiofor are good guys, so much so they could be considered saintly, so when and if they die, they must die in biblical ways. Two more nods at how unsubtle the filmmaker is, laying on the emotions with a trowel. Cusack's Curtis is a good guy as well, but he is only out to make sure his family is safe. This makes him the most complicated character. And he isn't saying much.

Someone at Sony clearly likes Emmerich's work because he also seems to have been given too much money to make this film. This leads to multiple conclusions and multiple ""suspenseful"" situations. Really, as soon as you think the remaining people are safe, someone does something to jeopardize them. Then, everyone has to run around, look tense, and shout, ""Nothing can be done"" as one-person risks life and limb to fix the problem. These scenes are so overdone; complete with ticking clock and computer generated images showing how close everyone comes to oblivion. Emmerich seems to believe the planet creating havoc isn't enough.

Just to make sure we know a new day has dawned, as the survivors look out at a sunrise, Lily Curtis, Jackson's seven year old daughter proclaims she doesn't need to use the training pants any more. Hooray! The world is in pieces, but the little girl isn't wetting the bed anymore. All is right with the world. Good thing she isn't wetting the bed anymore. Where would she get the training pants?

 ""2012"" is way too loud, way too long, way too broad and not relevant enough to make any of this worth it.",1259625600,6,7827,4.586132952108649
3735423,3,B001OQCV2E,"I'm a sucker for ""end of the world"" type stories. And I'm familiar with Director Roland Emmerich's style (Independence Day, Day After Tomorrow, 10,000 BC) so I went into this film fairly confident of what to expect: a good premise with an ""OK"" plot, fairly interesting characters that are only slightly more than one-dimensional, and outstanding special effects sequences of chaos and destruction. What I got instead was essentially a weaker version of the film ""Deep Impact"" only with destruction coming not from the sky but from below. Remember, ""Deep Impact""? It was that other asteroid movie--Morgan Freeman was the president--released around the same time as Michael Bay's Aerosmith video, I mean film, ""Armageddon.""

""2012"" does have the great effects sequences, but the pace is uneven and while it raises some interesting moral questions, such questions were raised in a much less ham-handed fashion in ""Deep Impact."" If you do go to see this in the theater for the effects sequences definitely save your money and go to the matinee.",1259452800,,1040,5.117647058823529
3735424,3,B001OQCV2E,"2012 is talked about very much these days, I'm sure everyone has heard about the world coming to an end in that specific year. The Maya civilization's calendar ends on that specific day and there are various beliefs about the date. The movie 2012 is about the apocalyptic event, it shows us what could happen. The movie starts in 2009 and goes to the following years gradually and explains what happens in these years that relate to the 2012 date which I thought was well made. It follows the stories of geologist Adrian Helmsley and of divorced father Jackson Curtis, a writer who works as a limousine driver who works for a rich Russian. Helmsley learns from his friend in India while visiting him that the earth`s temperature is increasing and that it will lead to the end of the world. He informs President Thomas Wilson of this. The other story has Curtis learning about the end of the world and tries to save his children and his ex-wife. There is this huge plot about the end of the world and the stories of two individual`s struggles because of it. One wants to save the world and the other wants to save his family.

There have been a few doomsday movies in the past few years and this one is no doubt capitalizing on movies like The Day After Tomorrow`s success. 2012 ends up being a little long at over 2 hours and a half but there are plenty of special effects that will amaze you and keep you interested throughout the movie. The characters are interesting but not to point that I really cared about them that much. I know this movie is based on the said 2012 event but some things in there just don`t seem very realistic or convincing. 2012 relies perhaps too much on special effects rather than on the story itself. It`s a good serious attempt at making us live the end of the world (if you believe in it) trough more than 2h and a half, it`s real honest and to the point. It is true that the ones that could be saved would be the rich an powerful people but seeing it makes you realize it. I liked 2012 but I would say that unless you`re really interested in the end of the world you`d be better just renting it when it comes out on DVD instead.",1259452800,2,2161,4.349009900990099
3735425,3,B001OQCV2E,"When I thought about all the hoopla that surrounded the release of this film, I figured that the film would delve into the Mayan culture (which predicts the now-infamous world-ending date) and how people of the Earth would interpret in during that fateful year.  Instead, I got a disaster film...nothing more.

Of course, if you a fan of the ""disaster film"" genre, then this may be one of the best films you see all year.  The special effects are incredible, and action is non-stop, and a few scenes (like the crumbling of the Christ The Redeemer statue in Brazil) that are iconic.  It compares favorable to other movies of its type, including ""Titanic"" and ""Cloverfield"".

Where this film falls short of those films, though, is that fact that its appeal ends at ""disaster"".  The characters (at least the main ones) are almost blatantly ripped off from ""War of the Worlds"" (the Tom Cruise version) in terms of family dynamics, and by the end of the film you still don't find yourself really rooting for them with any heartfelt emotion.  Also, what little semblance of a plot that does exist moves by way too quickly, with no time devoted to fleshing them out or making them truly crucial to the story.  As I mentioned earlier, this movie sorely lacked any sort of discussion about why the Mayans predict the world to end in 2012, as well as more context on how the people of the ""Arks"" are chosen.  What could have been a fascinating character study in humanity instead is completely glossed-over by explosions and destruction.  Imagine The Dark Knight without The Joker, and you pretty much get the picture.

Thus, unless you are a huge fan of incredible special effects and prolonged action sequences, I would advise you to skip this effort, as it just doesn't bring any more to the table than that.",1259280000,,1801,4.703821656050955

These questions remain unanswered, on screen just as in life, but for goodness sake, what does it take to make you guys give up five stars to a movie?  This picture has everything, and then it has everything else piled on top of it like a big yummy sundae dripping with chocolate sauce and nuts.  We went on Thanksgiving Day, traditionally the one time in the year when fifty percent of the audience is sleeping off a gigantic meal, yet this time around, people were screaming in terror and wonderment.  Screaming and pounding their fists on their seats and clutching their neighbors even if you didn't know them from Adam.  At that point none of us were worried about the likelihood of a Mayan prediction.  The screen told us what was happening...  the world was suffering from Earth Displacement...  the inside of the earth became a microwave...  Yellowstone Park turned into a volcano.  There haven't been too many good movies set in Yellowstone Park but let me tell you, those scenes there are unbelievably tense.  I wonder if Yellowstone will suffer a dip in tourism because after seeing 2012, you'd have to be crazy to visit there, just in case the Mayans were right!

John Cusack stars as a novelist whose book Farewell Atlantis has some eerie parallels with what's happening right underneath his feet.  They never do explain why his book is so similar to the events of 2012, but I fogured that maybe he had a little Mayan predictor-y blook in him.  What happened to Cusack?  He was never an Adonis, but now it looks as though someone had punched him in the mouth at birth.  What a mug, and yet, he underacts his way through a part which another actor might have botched utterly.  There are scenes where he and Amanda Peet are trying to comfort each other and give the other one strength that are really beautifully done, but what's weird is that Peet, who has gone through the same ordeals as Cusack or nearly, still has on every mg of her makeup on and her expensive haircut still lovingly teased into just the right suggestion of earth-ending anguish, while Cusack just looks like hell.  Maybe the audience wouldn't stand for it to see him with a plain woman, or even an average woman.  Well, more power to the star system!  On the black side of things, we have Thandie Newton utterly exquisite as the art consultant daughter, Laura, of the US president, Danny Glover, and she meets cute with a top geologist called Adrian (Chiwetel Ejiofor), and they are pretty evenly matched according to looks.  Glover plays the US president as though he were shellshocked going into the movie, with touches of Reagan's last days of dementia.",1259280000,,2724,4.643006263048017

It seems top scientists and world leaders have known for years what the Mayans knew - that the earth would be destroyed by earthquakes and tsunamis in 2012 - and only a few people would be saved aboard giant arks being built in China.  Jackson, being a resourceful (and preternaturally lucky) guy, rushes his family to China with no time to spare.

This movie delivers on the special effects, no doubt about it.  Watching California collapse into the ocean was really convincing.  There were two problems for me, however:  I didn't like any of the characters (many of whom were cartoonish) and the endless narrow escapes were too ludicrous to take seriously.  Cusack wasn't a strong enough leading man to hold my interest; likewise Amanda Peet never convinced me she was a real wife and mother experiencing the last day on earth.  Their kids were too cute, the Russian bad guy was neither villainous nor funny, just off-putting, and Danny Glover was wasted playing a noble President.

I hate it, when a serious plot is mixed up or alternates with black humor, out-of-the-context romantic interludes  and literally dozens of narrow escape situations. There are so many of these scenes, that it becomes truly annoying and too much to bear. I'd say that, many of the latest American movies are filled with that sort of junk.  However, Mr. Emmerich has outdone himself in regards to the Special FX and Computarized animations. These alone, make the movie worth seeing!! The Special effects are awesome and fascinating!

If you know anything about Roland Emmerich, you know that he likes his CG... and lots of it, and usually at the expense of believability and good storytelling sense, even for the far out science fiction genre where audiences expect the usual. If instead, you came to see lots of glorious CG mayhem and stuff getting destroyed in spectacular fashion, you are in for a good time. 2012 is unabashedly dumb sci-fi and elevates the art of apocalyptic destruction to new heights. His over-the-top CG-driven films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Independence-Day/dp/B000WQWPKA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Independence Day</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Day-After-Tomorrow/dp/B000VDDWE2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Day After Tomorrow</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godzilla/dp/B00164EAC8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godzilla</a>&nbsp;have grossed hundreds of millions of dollars around the world, so why change a winning, if uninspired, formula, right?

This time, he blows up the entire world. A master of subtlety he is not.

The story takes too long to ramp up, and for the first 35 minutes, I was waiting for the destruction to begin. Never mind the paper-thin premise of the Mayan prophecy. It's only mentioned in passing. We don't get any explanation of that besides a 60-second Flash animation made by Charlie Frost (Woody Harrelson), a survivalist, conspiracy nut and amateur radio personality. I didn't care about the predictable and cliche exposition about the discovery by scientists of Earth's impending doom and preposterous scientific explanation that follows. We've seen this already in Day After Tomorrow,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Core/dp/B0000AKCKM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Core</a>, or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deep-Impact/dp/B002DMJLTE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deep Impact</a>, and countless other disaster movies. The idea of solar flares heating up the Earth and dire predictions of destruction are similar to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Knowing/dp/B001GCUNZI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Knowing</a>. You can sleep through the first 1/4 of the movie and not miss anything. It's all background exposition about characters we don't care about, including Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), a writer who works part-time as a chauffeur to a rich Russian businessman, Curtis's estranged wife and 2 kids, or her new plastic surgeon boyfriend, and other dysfunctional relationships between father and son, etc. Everyone is pretty much a throw-away character with throw-away performances by a seemingly laryngitis-afflicted Danny Glover as the unconvincing President, Thandie Newton as his daughter, etc, but you didn't come for the human drama.

In 2012, Emmerich is up to his old tired tricks again. Jackson Curtis is rapper&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/50-Cent/dp/B000QUCPUC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">50 Cent</a>'s name backwards. In 10,000 BC, the protagonist is named D'Leh, which is ""Held"" backwards, German for ""hero"". He likes to re-use character stereotypes. We get a nutty disposable character, Charlie (a waste of Woody Harrelson's talents), who is the same kind of character as the homeless guy from Day After Tomorrow. We also have the same tireless scientist trying to convince world leaders. We get a dog running to its owner and leaping to safety at the last possible moment just like in Independence Day. One of the kids is named Noah, a corny reference to the later plot element. Lastly, we get a heavy-handed, trite, and preachy speech at the end about humanity and compassion like in Independence Day. It's all very kid-friendly PG-13 stuff and it's OK that the rest of the humanity gets completely annihilated as long as the main characters escape impossible odds by the skin of their teeth, right?

The story is safe, very average, and wholly predictable, but that's what makes it profitable. If you're going to see this, you are probably in it for the CG anyway and not for the quantum leaps of logic required to follow the story, and that's where I can find no fault. The CG is extravagant and you've never seen terrestrial destruction this fantastical before! With top-notch cinematography and set designs, 2012 really sets the bar very high for future apocalyptic films to come and takes us to new levels of ridiculosity. Entire continents get ripped up, whole cities go down in flames, an aircraft carrier demolishes the White House! And of course, our heroes flee in a Russian Antonov An-225, the largest fixed wing aircraft ever built (it was designed to transport the Russian space shuttle), because fuel economy and maneuverability is no big deal when escaping the end of the world, and of course, 10 people really do need all that leg room. And naturally, such a plane would be filled with Bentleys, Ferraris and other luxury cars that they don't jettison, because you never know when you might need them. Don't you know how hard it is to find voice-activated ignition and genuine all-leather interiors during the end times?

It's hard to know where to start. The plot is boring and predictable. If you've ever seen a disaster film, then you've seen this one already, many times. The acting is wooden, the Russian accents pitiful, and the dialogue worst of all. The world is crashing and burning, and this is how people talk?!

At one point near the beginning, I got confused and thought I was watching a comedy. The protagonist's ex-wife and her new husband are in a grocery store. He says to her, ""I feel like something has come between us."" The very next second, a deep chasm splits the store in two, with her on one side and him on the other. (At that point, the writing is on the wall as to the stepfather's fate.)

Even the visuals are so over-the-top that it became hard not to giggle. How many times can gigantic ripples of earth follow only inches behind our hero? How many toppling buildings can he drive under or fly through, without a scratch?

Top critics (see Rotten Tomatoes) are near unanimous in their consternation over this humongous waste of talent and resources. Take movie critic Joe Morgenstern of the Wall Street Journal. He describes 2012 as an ""oafish epic"" with a ""scatterbrained"" script:

""2012, Roland Emmerich's latest assault on planet Earth and its moviegoers, isn't the end of the world: It only feels that way. This oafish epic ... operates in a dead zone roughly equidistant between parody and idiocy.... [T]he cumulative effect is numbness.... 2012 has no discernible attitude toward the end of civilization, apart from the belief that there's a movie in it.""

Finally, women (including Thandie Newton of Crash as the daughter of the President, played by Danny Glover) are strictly eye candy. When it comes to saving the world, it's a job for men alone.

So here, the rain is turned into a melting and boiling earth core, causing earthquakes and volcano eruptions and super tsunamis and shifts of continental crusts, all traced back to unusual sun activity and misbehaviour of naughty neutrinos. All in December 2012. Beware!
Noah's part, in the voluntary absence of Obama's aged impersonation Danny Glover, is taken by a guy whose name sounds like Budweiser. The rules of the game have changed. Boarding passes for the ark(s) are not allocated on family basis, but cost a cool 1 Bio Euro per head.
There is a lot of desperate racing to the ark(s) going on. Cinematoscopic freedom is much enhanced by the shift of the continents. That absolves the script from plausibility restrictions.
Mount Ararat, the alleged resting place of Noah's ark, is here replaced by another mountain, but I want to avoid spoilers.

There are far too many scenes where John Cusack is driving just ahead of a crack, or a caving landscape, almost like a surfer on the crest of the wave. I feel the movie dissipates a lot of its potential drama by being too cute and predictable with the protagonists always just getting out of the way of crashing buildings in the nick of time. And when people do get killed it often seems inconsequential as we simply aren't made to care about them. There are a few scenes that reminded me of the ""Poseidon Adventure"", which then led me to contemplate the difference between these two films. The ""Poseidon Adventure"" was a drama built up around believable characters who we empathized with, and who we felt a real sense of tragedy with when they died, but ""2012"", for the most part, fails to do this, and instead gives us a host of parodies, and largely comical characters, that we care so little for. This film will probably satisfy people just enough, but it could have been so much more. It is interesting to note that Roland Emmerich's first film was ""The Noah's Ark Principle"".

Another oddity is that I didn't feel much for the people in the film.  There was so much action that no one bothered to develop the characters so the audience could bond with them.  I cared just a little bit as to whether or not the main characters lived or died.  This had no where near the grace, bonding or depth of story that ""Deep Impact"" or ""Knowing"" had.

I admit I was very disappointed in this film. In general I like disaster movies, but this film had a `made for TV movie' level of plot, combined with movie-level graphics. I just wasn't feeling the love. In particular I was frustrated by the main protagonist who somehow, we are supposed to feel sorry for. He neglects his family, has no clue about what's going on with his own children, and then takes his kids to Yellowstone, not once, but twice, during a time when the park has heightened volcanic activity. Yep. Dad of the year. To make matters worse, the actor never really seems excited about anything. He goes through major trauma, with no worries at all. He was a poor choice for that role. At least put some eye candy if I'm going to have to watch the character sleepwalk through his role.

Plot devices seemed to have been lifted from War of the Worlds, including the divorced dad with the estranged kids, the newly involved wife, etc. I honestly could care less whether his daughter was potty trained or not and yet that was the comment we get to hear and nod at in the end. And of course the divorced dad and mom will get together at the end because, you know we need that sappy happy ending and the hero really suddenly now is daddy material. Yuck.

The plot was quite juvenile. Particularly the ending with the speech by the scientist which was eyeball-rollingly sappy and wasted more time than the characters had.

Truth be told, maybe a large percentage of our general public is clamoring for this now... they prefer loud booms and flashing pyrotechnics over a real story.

For whatever reason, 2012 is EXACTLY what you would expect with zero surprises.

If you love CGI, then you will love 2012.
Fact be told, this movie is basically a non-stop demonstration of modern CGI technology.

And YES, that part of the film is impressive simply as a demonstration of our computer technology today.

The story is so plain, simple and generic it feels like a Disney family film.

If all these special effects had been used to tell a story of disaster as a serious movie this could have been very, very good.

Unfortunately all these excellent special effects were somewhat wasted making essentially a COMEDY.

2012 follows a sort of campy, cheesy, Hollywood formula without taking itself very serious.

If only they had made this a SERIOUS and dark disaster movie, it would have probably been good.

However the movie has a very fake and synthetic feel to it.
Never do you lose yourself in the movie and for a few moments forget you are only seeing a film.

2012 is ""stiff"" and gives the feeling that the actors spent 2 weeks in front of a blue screen and went home.
THEN ... the CGI and computer animation team went to work creating a movie around the footage of the actors.

Yet for all it's high-tech gimmicks, it fails to evoke the kind of DOOMSDAY FEEL one experiences in a simpler movie like MIRACLE MILE.

But hey... 2012 is what you expect it to be.
A popcorn munching, leave your brain at home, loud and predictable teen movie.

It's surprising this was not a Summer release...... but obviously due to the plot we all know why they chose to release it now.

It was entertaining to watch for 90 minutes.
And I always give credit to the hard work the computer geeks have to do to create fake worlds and movies like this.
Unlike actors, the efforts and hard work of these nameless CGI teams often go uncredited.

3735444,4,B001OQCV2E,"The calendar of the ancient Mayan civilization predicted a great global change to occur on the 21st of December in the year 2012.  Not surprisingly, this very date has been the subject of extreme debate amongst scientists and theologians, as we edge closer to that portentous date now just a little more than three years ahead of us.  And suppose this date was a warning, that the world as we have known it will come to an end?  This is at the center of ""2012"", another mega-budget apocalyptic mayhem from director Roland Emmerich, who had given us THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW and INDEPENDENCE DAY.

The fact that this is not the first end-of-the-world film ever made (the theme was explored in sci-fi movies at least as far back as the 1930s, and became more widespread with the proliferation of nuclear weapons during the Cold War) is no deterrent to Emmerich, his cast, or his special effects technicians; they make the most out of a plot that has an extremely large solar storm somehow causing the Earth's geophysical structure to collapse, causing an ever-escalating chain of cataclysms that eventually climax with the Apocalypse.  At the center of it all is a failed sci-fi writer (John Cusack), his wife (Amanda Peet), the scientist (Chiwetel Ejiofor) who predicted the sequence of mega-disasters, and a series of arks being completed to house the last remaining human and animal life after The End.  Despite a few lapses, notably Woody Harrelson doing a rather ridiculous and over-the-top nut job role of a government conspiracy theorist with a Manson-like stare, look, and voice, ""2012"" soon puts the emphasis on Cusack, Peet, and their kids, as they try to get on the U.S.-led ark as the world collapses.

To put it mildly, there's no real subtlety present in ""2012"" as there was in the earlier 2009 doomsday drama KNOWING, since Emmerich's filmography shows him to be more of the Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay school of destruction filmmaking than anything else.  And as so often happens in mega-budget films like this, the action and the plausibility of the plot are often stretched to the breaking point (as with L.A. and San Francisco both swallowed up whole by the Pacific plate, a pivot point of the NBC-TV miniseries 10.5 and 10.5: APOCALYPSE).  Beyond that, however, and the fact that Emmerich is not another Steven Spielberg, the film nevertheless has solid performances from Cusack, Peet, and Ejiofor, as well as solid turns from Danny Glover (as the last American president), Oliver Platt, and (in a minor cameo role) George Segal.  And, of course, the total obliteration of the world is rendered with frightening impact, borrowing every single CGI trick known to Hollywood, and bits and pieces from every sci-fi/disaster opus made since the heyday of the genre in the 1970s.

In all good honesty, ""2012"" is not a masterpiece.  But in terms of providing insane special effects bang for a cost of hundreds of millions, it might as well be.",1258329600,2,2954,4.909638554216867

What makes this film fail is the fact that Roland uses the same disaster movie formula once again yet with a different destruction template... it's all been done better before, yet what this film does excel in is giving you blind, dumb and mindless entertainment.
Independence Day was good because it basically introduced the ""disaster film"" and had to do with an alien race which people always find interesting. The characters were deep, relatable and actual good recognizable actors. The script was inspiring, giving us a glimpse of what it would be like for all the world's cultures and countries to come together to fight for a cause (with of course the USA being on top, but that's expected). The Day After Tomorrow was good because of again, good characterization and young and vibrant actors. Sure the actual acting was at times subpar, but the quality of the script gave you a feeling of what might actually happy if such an intense storm were to strike the world. There were plenty of characters and each was given their own unique stories and backgrounds, loves, fears, etc.
These two movies succeeded because they were about the characters in the disaster, not simply the disaster itself and the character's running away from it.
In 2012, the disaster is the star of the show, and the pitifully poor casting did nothing to help the stale characterization of the movie. You have your noble protagonist, your ""comic relief"" protagonist (John Cusack, who JUUUUUST saves this from being a total casting disaster), your selfish bureaucratic fat guy, yous kids (who of course survive), your female love interests who do nothing but stand there being pretty-faced love interests, and your government extras. There simply weren't enough main characters in this movie, and the ones who are there aren't given enough screen time for any of them to be known or cared for. There really isn't any ""society"" character either (as in, barely any news broadcast scenes, scenes of flocks of people trying to avoid disaster, etc), so one doesn't really feel like the disaster is REALLY affecting the entire world.
Sure the special effects are fantastic and thrilling, but how long do those last? 2, 3 minutes? This is a 2 and 1/2 hour movie, and I mostly forget what all of it was filled with.
Emmerich has been doing this so long that I guess he figures doing it half-baked will go unnoticed and the movie will still rake in millions, which it probably will considering the quality of the special effects. But if you're looking for a quality character-based film you'll remember, don't count on it with 2012.",1258329600,5,2770,4.845991561181434

3735449,5,B001OQCV2E,"I had an interesting pre-cursor while going in to see 2012. I was with a small group of three, and I handed my tickets to the doorman, who, after ripping them and handing me back the stubs, said: ""Enjoy this graphics, this isn't the kind of movie you go and see for the dialog.""  My friends and I looked at each other and laughed. We were also a bit worried. Did we just drop about $15 bucks each to watch another disaster movie with vacant plot and characters? Are we foolish to expect more than a vacant plot and characters in a disaster movie?

Fortunately, my answer is ""No."" The answer from one of my friends who was with me is ""Sort of."" But this isn't my friends review, it's mine. All mine! So, the answer is decidedly...""No"" on both counts. 2012 proves that you can actually have an entertaining disaster movie as well as a few emotional chords to strike.

2012 loads up quite the cast, with Woody Harrelson and Danny Glover making impressive appearances as the doomsday nut-job and the last President of the United States, respectively. However, the two people to follow in this movie -- and who brilliantly contribute to the a fore mentioned emotional chords are John Cusak and Chiwetel Ejiofor (Thank You Wikipedia for help with the spelling). Cusak plays an author named Jackson Curtis (digressive fun fact: in reverse that would be the true name of 50 Cent), a not-so-famous author who has sold little over 400 copies of his published book. It's easy for Jackson, whose day job is chauffeuring the wealthy, to think that he hasn't made even the slightest impression in the cultural fabric of his country. However, Chiwetel who plays the much easier to spell Adrian Helmsley is one of the few people who has read Jackson's book - and was profoundly affected by it. Adrian, by the way, is the guy who brokers the discovery of the Earth's expanding core to the President of the United States. Adrian is also the guy who brokers Jackson's soul-stirring humanizing words to the last vestige of humanity. A humanity that is losing its humaneness in the Darwinian struggle for cataclysmic survival.

I'm serious, this is the subtext of the movie. And I'm even more serious when I say that ""it works"". Especially since all of this is the subtle thread to the ""real plot"" which finds Jackson trying to get his estranged family from Los Angeles to Las Vegas to China so that they can hop aboard the official and highly-secret and even more highly-exclusive survival plan that has been set in place by the government of every country. It is here -- the flight plans from LA to Vegas to China where we can indulge the irrefutably fantastic disaster graphics promised by the ticket-taker. And, yes, true to the wit of the ticket-taker, this is not a movie you go see for the dialog. Even the director, Roland Emmerich, knows this, since he very cleverly and wisely interrupts several moments of cliche sentimentality. Don't worry, I haven't given anything away. There is nothing to give away in this movie. Emmerich takes everything you would expect in a disaster movie, crams it in and sets it ablaze with the rest of everything else that topples over into his global pyre.

And, yes, it all makes for quite a spectacle to be seen on the big screen. Without a doubt, had I waited for DVD and watched this movie on my much smaller home screen, I would have missed the best part of the End Times.",1258329600,,3396,4.6158940397351

3735451,3,B001OQCV2E,"Disaster movies are a dime-a-dozen in Hollywood. The approaching year ""2012"" has raised several speculations from the Mayan calendar to Nostradamus to the Bible code. Many believe that the year 2012 would hold special significance in the history of mankind, many think that something life-changing would happen and an epic catastrophe may cause mankind`s extinction. Leave it to Hollywood to take advantage of the ""2012"" phenomenon with co-writer/director Roland Emmerich's ""2012"". Emmerich has two disaster movies under his belt (Day After Tomorrow and Independence Day) and his latest film ""2012"" follows the same formulas that made other disaster movies successful. Sure, there is nothing uncommon about ""2012"", following a simple formula usually means huge returns in the box-office because they do work for mainstream audiences. Following the blueprint of past blockbusters usually mean success in the box-office and this film is that exact same overused formula. ""2012"" is ridiculously predictable and familiar; it gives you everything you have seen before while injecting it a heavy dose of steroids.

The movie begins with two scientists in 2009 who are having a discussion about an impending doom in the year 2012, and there is nothing anyone can do about it. The Earth's crust is about to undergo a polar shift because of the bombardment of neutrinos from the sun's surface. Doctor Adrian Helmsmen (Chiwetel Ejiofor, Redbelt) brings his findings to world leaders to prepare for the eventual cataclysm in order to preserve humanity in the cost of billions in Euro-Dollars in building an ark to save the world`s finest minds and  a fraction of its population. Back in Los Angeles, struggling divorced dad Jackson Curtis (John Cusack, High Fidelity) is on a camping trip with his two kids when he bumps into a conspiracy theorist (Woody Harrelson, Zombieland) who predict that the world will end in the year 2012 and that the truth is being kept secret by the governments of the world. Jackson's first reaction is disbelief, but when a horrible earthquake destroys the area where his ex-wife (Amanda Peet) shops and something clues him in to the possible truth in the warnings, Jackson must race to save his family while the entire world crumbles around them...

Let's see, Emmerich is on familiar ground in this disaster epic. A moving speech, check. A car-chase scene with earth upheavals right behind, check. A plane taking off to take our heroes where they need to go, check. Massive Tsunamis that destroy major cities and landmarks, check. A sacrifice, check. Corrupt officials, check. An ending so predictable, check. The film's plot elements are very uninspired, and truth be told the movie offers nothing we haven't seen before. Emmerich does make the special effects grander, more polished and bigger than anything we've seen before. ""2012"" is an adrenaline ride that can bring some to the edge of their seats. The film does look very `spiffy' and you feel each drop of debris, each loud explosion, each toppled building as Jackson's family make their way from Pasadena to the mountains of safety. It is a simple chase film with a race against time, the elements used to generate tension are the cookie-cutter kind, not to say that they weren't successful but the film doesn't manage to generate a feeling of dread throughout its entirety. It makes everything all elementary and perfunctory, as the film focuses on a family, a scientist and some key authority figures.

To hide the weaknesses of its script, Emmerich opts to overload the audience with astounding, jaw-dropping special effects so that the details of the plot will not reach our brains. The script also opts to incorporate some comedic one-liners. There is also some doses of black comedy as we see someone impersonate California Governor Schwarzenegger as his speech ""the worst is over"" precedes the biggest disaster in California.  I guess this was an attempt to please mainstream audiences so that they can't really complain about the bleakness of the film's theme. Approaches like this appear to stem the emotions; while Hollywood calls a balance, I thought it is all formula done to make it easy to relate to. I guess I prefer my `end of the world' movies to go into truths than to become a mere action film. The film does manage to touch on the selfishness of humanity when faced with an impending disaster, the powers of the rich and several morality questions in Helmsley's speech. The conversation between a musician and his granddaughter was pretty touching albeit a bit forced. Yes, Emmerich does try to incorporate human drama, but it is a minor element that becomes outdone by its comedy and visual effects.

The characters in ""2012"" are pretty much your usual caricatures. There is no doubt in my mind that viewers can predict the outcome of the estranged relationship between Jackson, his ex-wife and his kids, as the new boyfriend angle has been done for years. Danny Glover plays the president of the United States. I thought he was decent as the commander in chief while Oliver Platt plays the conniving stooge that comes in the way of the `right thing'. I guess fear makes people do stupid things sometimes, and the conspiracy to hide the foreseen 2012 disaster also serves as the villain the movie. One question: if everyone knew, and humanity had the chance to come together, would more arks have been built without the almighty lure of greed?

""2012"" isn't a bad movie, it is actually an entertaining dose of a disaster film that has all the elements of past disaster movies that just is so much bigger, louder and grander. Think ""Dante's Peak"", ""The Day After Tomorrow"", ""The Towering Inferno"", ""10.5"" and the ""Airport"" franchise all compressed into one ""souped-up"" action movie. I have yet to see Hollywood portray a disaster movie with the exercise of bleak and depressing truth, the loss of lives is ignored for a perfunctory happy ending and dry resolution. The film clocks in at 157 minutes, Emmerich goes back and forth from the canned melodrama and the comedic tone to keep the audience distracted in its duller moments. It works in some ways since the film is fast-paced and it feels shorter. However, the film could've used better elements in its runtime; ""2012"" provides crowd-pleasing fun, but isn't any disaster supposed to be dark and bleak? With the approaching Dec. 21, 2012, a film like this should provoke a thought and not to become another eye-candy rich popcorn film.

3735463,4,B001OQCV2E,"Roland Emmerich's ""2012"" will probably set records. In all my years, I've never seen a film where Earth is so spectacularly destroyed. If you can imagine ""Earthquake"" crossed with ""Dante's Peak,"" ""Deep Impact,"" and just a hint of ""The Poseidon Adventure,"" you still wouldn't come close to understanding the level of devastation this film depicts. Cities don't just fall to the ground in a pile of rubble; houses, streets, freeways, and even entire skyscrapers practically disintegrate as massive cracks form at the surface. Tectonic plates shift thousands of miles, causing coastal cities to literally sink into the ocean. We see tsunamis thousands of feet high. We see the entire state of Hawaii turning into an active volcano. We see the caldera in Yellowstone National Park erupting, sending chunks of mountain the size of football fields whizzing through the air.

My hometown, Los Angeles, is the first to go. We've lived through our share of large earthquakes, but I can safely say we've never had a shockwave make the ground rise and fall like ripples in water. And I'm pretty sure we've never had a magnitude 10.9 on the Richter scale, with fissures as wide as the Grand Canyon branching off of the San Andreas Fault. Emmerich, whose filmography suggests he's going through an apocalyptic phase, doesn't merely entertain the idea of such catastrophes actually happening - he creates them and, in a good way, finds ways of beating you over the head with them. When it comes to destruction, his imagination knows no bounds. Apparently, neither does the patience of the special effects department, who must have worked for months on end without taking a break. How many computer companies were involved with this film? All of them, it seems.

Similar destructive events occur in Las Vegas, Rio de Janeiro, and The Vatican, where a crack runs across the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and splits the ""Birth of Man"" painting at just the right spot. And let's not forget the monstrous wave that carries the USS ""John F. Kennedy"" all the way to the White House.

But before any of this happens, we're introduced to a slew of characters. The most prominent are struggling author Jackson Curtis (John Cusack), his estranged ex-wife, Kate (Amanda Peet), and their young children, Lilly and Noah (Morgan Lily and Liam James). Tagging along with them is Kate's new boyfriend, a plastic surgeon named Gordon (Thomas McCarthy), who doubles as an amateur pilot. There's also Adrian Helmsley (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a scientific advisor who reports to President Thomas Wilson (Danny Glover) and his Chief of Staff, Carl Anheuser (Oliver Platt). Rounding out the cast is Zlatko Buric as a Russian billionaire, Thandie Newton as the President's daughter, and Woody Harrelson as a prophetic wacko who runs a radio show from his RV in Yellowstone.

I'm not going to reveal the specifics of humanity's fight for survival, but rest assured, it involves secret government projects, debates over who should live and who should die, and a lot of tragic (if brief) death scenes. None of this plays particularly well; like most disaster movies, ""2012"" goes all out with special effects but skimps on story, character, dialogue, and plausibility. It runs at a lengthy 158 minutes, yet the number of barely developed and unresolved subplots makes it seem oddly condensed. Its greatest miscalculation is its use of humor, which is often relied upon during the most inappropriate times. And as for Harrelson's character, well, he's just flat out annoying. For everything he accomplishes in the way eye candy, Emmerich has never really been one for compelling human drama.

Then again, do we ever go into a disaster movie with compelling human drama in mind? No. Let's face it: In the movies, destruction is cool. There is a reason, after all, that films like ""Earthquake,"" ""The Towering Inferno,"" or even Emmerich's own ""Independence Day"" were such big box office hits. Yes, watching buildings collapse or fires raging or tidal waves hitting coastal cities or spaceships incinerating the Empire State Building is a disturbingly satisfying experience, but for the life of me, I don't understand why.

Then again, I don't think anyone understands it. I think the filmmakers just go with what works, no questions asked. Emmerich is, like Irwin Allen before him, a master of disaster, and ""2012"" should be seen for that very reason. It also has to be seen just for the sake of sheer awesome spectacle - the story may be a failure, but my God, you've never seen anything like it. It's so good looking that we barely notice what little emphasis is placed on its link with the ancient Mayan calendar, which pinpoints December 21, 2012 as the date the world will come to an end. Maybe it's just as well; the last thing we need is a special effects extravaganza giving anyone a reason to worry over nothing. Believe me, it was bad enough entering the new millennium with constant talk of the Y2K virus.",1258243200,,4965,4.954381752701081

It was a good storyline of disasters striking and the stunning visual effects that go with the disasters.  No kidding, the computer graphics were some of the best stuff I have ever seen in a disaster movie. It was about 3 hours long and I would watch it again, in a heartbeat.  John Cusak is one of the primary characters.  Morgan Freeman plays the US President.

The movie begins in 2009, in India, where heavy rains are taking place.  An elevator descends deep into a copper mine where scientists are studying solar eruptions that have been occurring and ""are heating up the Earth's core like a microwave.""  From India, our Geologist, Adrian, travels to Washington DC to advise the White House of a national geological crisis.  We fast-forward 6 months, into 2010, to a summit in British Columbia, advising members that the world will soon be coming to an end.  We then travel to see Tibetan Monks talking (in Tibet), to London in 2011, and to Paris.

Then it is 2012.  The biggest solar climax in history, along with a galactic alignment, is predicted.  The governments are making arrangements to ensure their continued operation, and the filthy rich are buying tickets for special passage ""out of Dodge"", so to speak.

All of a sudden, the xxxx begins to hit the fan as the San Andreas Fault begins to shift and streets start cracking down the middle in San Francisco.  About this time, Cusak (a divorced father of 2 children) picks his children up to take them to Yellowstone National Park, not knowing the military has closed the park off to tourists.  It seems the super volcano has become rather active and is expected to erupt as the Earth's crust is destabilizing (like dissolving).  In the wooded area surrounding the Park, we meet Woody Harrelson, who appears to be a hippy fruit-loop kinda guy.  Woody is studying all this stuff and broadcasting to anyone who will listen.

Meanwhile, temperatures continue to rise globally as spectacular visual effects begin appearing.  The story heats up as fast as the Earth's crust and things are poppin' and people are hoppin'!  Everything stayed pretty intense for the rest of the movie, so much so that I left with a very slight headache from the level of intensity.  Quite simply, I was bustin' outta my chair.  It was completely enjoyable and very entertaining.

3735466,5,B001OQCV2E,"I hope no one went to 2012 expecting good science, good acting, good continuity, and good script. If you did, you went to the wrong movie.

I wasn't expecting any of that. What I WAS expecting was fun watching the the scenery getting torn apart, totally unbelievable escapes from death, and enough of a script - just enough, mind you - to provide a transition between most the most excellent CGI sections.

I got more than I expected on the CGI side. Many CGI-heavy movies give you just a few seconds of an effect, as if given time to study it you'd realize you were seeing the result of a computer chugging through the bits and bites that the technicians gave it to munch on.

2012, however, gives you enough time to admire the effects and the people behind them. Indeed, the screen is so filled with wall-to-wall action that I won't appreciate the bulk of it until I can watch and re-watch the movie on Blu-Ray.

So, here's to 2012 and Emmerich. They gave me what I was looking for in a disaster flick: disaster. I'm not going to nit pick the obvious areas because that would be viewing the movie from an angle it wasn't meant to be viewed. 2012 makes no pretense about being an art-house film, or even a ""serious"" mainstream release. It just gives you what you paid for: the safe fun of watching the world fall down around your ears.

Pay your money and enjoy the full value of your purchase. Have fun! That's what this sort of movie's for.",1258243200,6,1443,4.409774436090226
3735467,1,B001OQCV2E,"I just got home from seeing this and was extremely disappointed.  What had so much potential ended up being one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my 35 years.

""Over the top"" is an understatement.  The writers and director went WAY overboard...and inserted into this film an hour of extra crap that wasn't needed.  The dialogue and connections between the cast were not there...and it was just plain annoying at times interrupting major actions sequences with truly idiotic romantic sequences which totally messed up the pace.

I was relieved when it was over, and I laughed (as did other audience members) several times throughout the film.  ""Are you kidding me"" was heard in the theatre several times through the 2.5 hour mess called 2012.

So much potential, such horrible execution.  The ONLY good things I can say about it are (1) great CGI/special effects (2) it makes you think a little about what matters when the end of the world is upon us and (3) Danny Glover did well.

Truly one of the worst directed films I have ever seen, and I've seen many, many movies.",1258243200,35,1076,4.650793650793651

3735469,4,B001OQCV2E,"Director Roland Emmerich is known for his disaster epics, such as the Sci-fi/Disaster hybrid ""Independence Day,"" the ""Godzilla"" remake, and the Global Warming thriller ""The Day After Tomorrow"" (And to be honest, my favorite film of his is ""The Patriot""). Now, he takes on the date that has millions fearing the future with his biggest disaster film yet, the epically-scaled ""2012."" The film depicts the supposed end of days as predicted by the Mayans, who some claim predicted the end of days as occurring on December 21, 2012. Thought the actual theories surrounding the supposed end of time is questionable, it makes for a big, epic event film.
The film has a reported budget of $260 Million, and it seems that every dollar has made it to the screen. There are many big sequences in the film, and some are thrilling, even if they are a bit silly (i.e. the main actors surviving through circumstances no real human could). However, at two-hours, thirty-eight minutes, the film is overly long. By the middle of the film, the scenes of historic structures and religious symbols being pummeled by massive earthquakes become too repetitive. But the beginning and ending sequences, including the well-executed climax, make up for a lot.
As with ""The Day After Tomorrow,"" a lot of what's in the film is implausible in places. But once again, the weaknesses in the script are made up for by a terrific cast, including John Cusack, Amanda Peet, Chiwetel Ejiofor, among others. There's some good humorous moments, as with most of Emmerich's work. The music is great, and the visual effects are terrific. Overall, this is a fine film that fans of Emmerich's work are sure to enjoy.
Grade: B",1258156800,2,1681,4.881118881118881
3735470,2,B001OQCV2E,"I have been watching these films since the 1970's and hoped this would be a mold breaker. It was not. Same old tired plot situations and dialog. If you saw ""Earthquake"" or ""Towering Inferno"" or ""The Day After Tomorrow"" then you saw this. I just got back an hour ago from the theatre. Wished now I just waited for the DVD to come out. Good visuals though.",1258156800,5,354,4.298507462686567
3735471,3,B001OQCV2E,"Knowing Roland Emmerich's other films had me setting my expectation bar really low for 2012. Yes, the dialogue and script are beyond dumb at times, but that is exactly what most people should be expecting here. This is definitely one of those so bad it's good movies. It was also much longer than I thought it would be, clocking in at around two and a half hours (three if you include all the previews), but it held my attention throughout. The cast is quite large and features some big name actors like John Cusack, Danny Glover, Woody Harrelson, Amanda Peet, Thandie Newton and Oliver Platt, but most of them seem to be just going through the motions. I don't blame them because the script allows for nothing more. At least Woody gave it a wacky effort. I also found it funny how Cusack's character could drive his stretch limo and get out of more near death situations than James Bond on his best day. The one really bright spot are the amazing FX. I read that this film cost well over 200 million dollars to make and you can see why over and over again as you get bombarded by one visually stunning sequence after the next. In fact, I don't think the destuction of the Earth, as seen here, can ever be topped. I will probably end up buying this on Blu-ray to watch as a guilty pleasure.

While this is a major step up from 10,000 BC, The Day After Tomorrow and Godzilla, it falls shy of his Emmerich's better work, The Patriot and Independence Day. If you just want to munch on some popcorn as billions of people perish before your eyes, nobody does it better or more often than when this guy gets behind the camera. Whether it proves to be fact or fiction, I know I marked December 21, 2012 on my calendar. Now that I think about it, the Mayans couldn't even predict their own demise, so I think we'll be okay.",1258156800,4,1815,4.3698224852071
3735472,3,B001OQCV2E,"So, when the world ends, it's the politicians and bureaucrats that we're gonna save, and the writers and the artists and the spiritual leaders are left behind to deal with the apocalypse. That was the most depressing element of the movie. What will the world look like if we only save the ""important people"" in Washington? Heaven help us. Seriously. If the future world is to be populated with the slimy-dog politicians and their ilk, I think I'll take my chances with eternal life, thank you very much.

Sitting in the darkened theater watching 2012, I was reminded of ""The Bunker"" at White Sulphur Springs (in West Virginia). Construction on the 110,000-square-foot bunker was started under Eisenhower's watch, when we were worried that the USSR might blow us up into lots of radioactive pieces. Turns out, our beloved elected officials were prepared to push The Red Button that'd end the world as we know it, and then turn-tail and run into their bunker, slam the blast-proof door behind them and emerge 90 days later when the danger had passed. And the most amazing part: The Bunker is outfitted with gee-whiz features that'd lead the unsuspecting public to believe the lawmakers were still comfortably ensconced in Washington, DC. In other words, The Bunker was *designed* to perpetrate a fraud on the American people.

Watching ""2012"" I thought about The Bunker and realized, this movie is probably right. If and when the world ends, it'll be the politically important that are given seats on the lifeboats. And it's probably right that if there is a cataclysmic event, the Powers That Be will not tell the unwashed masses what's going on, lest they try and steal one of those seats on the lifeboat.

That's just depressing on so many levels.

But I digress.

This movie is definitely impressive on the big screen, and the soundtrack has plenty of bass (which I like). But the script and the writing was a little sappy for my tastes. And as to believability - well - this movie fell short on that score, too. I don't want to spoil the plot, but NO ONE can drive a limousine *that* well. On the plus side, the graphics are truly amazing and scarier than anything I've ever seen before. I had to turn away from the screen to avoid some of the scary-as-hell images. It's a pretty intense flick, and it does a good job of drawing you in.

A nice side effect: After watching this movie, I'm a lot less worried about getting those pesky credit cards paid off. Does make you think a little more about enjoying every day, and appreciating the simple beauty in our world.

In conclusion, it's an interesting flick with awe-inspiring graphics, and it'll hold your attention - if you can suspend disbelief for a couple hours.",1258156800,410,2720,4.725738396624473

8331132,3,B001OQCV2E,"I watched this movie solely for the special effects, as they seemed so highly touted.  And they were
good, but were too overdone, to the point of diluting excitement and awe.  They ramped up into
what I call ""finale mode"" much too quickly.  By the time Washington DC or Paris, etc.,  fell to annihilation,
it seemed fairly blase.  I mean, once you've seen a major metropolis engulfed in balls of fire, or sloughing off
into the ocean, you've seen them all.  That's the frame of mind I fell into too early in the film.  And the
dangers the protagonists encountered were WAY too close, way too over-the-top and ridiculous to be anything
but cartoonish.  It so completely put a distance to any sort of reality, that tension and suspense suffered as a result.

I won't go into all the defects of writing and predictability, which other reviewers have already pointed out.
I am just disappointed that a film with this budget and tech talent could not do more with it.  It was merely
your basic, any-scale disaster story with completely unoriginal characters and dialog.  All the standard
""tug at the heart"" scenes were included; all the bland and expected ""moments of humor""; everything we've
seen a hundred times before, and even if we haven't, it still felt like it.  There should have been a greater sense
of the momentous, a different atmosphere conveying the horror, the awe of such unprecedented events;
but it somehow only conveyed a localized sense of urgency occasioned by any immediate danger.

There are a few things I'll mention, just to illustrate.  Several major areas of earth have been decimated;
no doubt billions are already dead.  And heads of state are reluctant to ""go public"", for fear of creating
panic and anarchy?  Sorry, guys, but I think you're out of the loop by this point.  And so many, many
minor points of near-impossibility that it becomes a major mass in the way of credulity:  people still
able to opportunely communicate on cell phones; everybody managing to get to China in what seems
a couple of hours; one of the main characters calls his estranged son in the midst of this global chaos,
and the ringing phone wakes him & his family from a sound and apparently blissfully unaware sleep.
I mean, only someone on a Mars colony could have been ignorant of what was going on in the world
by that point.  The one line in the whole film which was gratifying to me was when one of the lead
scientists confronts a wealthy industrialist as they were boarding the ""ark"", and lectures him on the
morality of ""buying"" his way onto the ark, while millions of poorer folk were to be left to die.  And the
industrialist says ""You can give your own tickets to them if you want, I don't care,"" and continues to board,
leaving the moralist looking befuddled, then meekly following industrialist onto the ship.  It showed the
hypocrisy which is rampant in the world today, and I'm surprised it was included in any film made in
the past decade.  I guess they just figured few people would notice it.

I will give it 3 stars, for I was able to watch the whole thing, the acting was completely adequate, and
the technical aspects were professionally done.  It was just the triteness of the story, the unoriginal
character types, the overwhelming feeling I'd seen all this before even though the scale of the setting
was so much larger--just the sameness and lack of anything substantially new--kept me from rating
it higher.",1527724800,,3436,4.697829716193656
