8677523,5,B003HC8884,"Season 1: Review: Bones is a really good show. I thought I would of not liked it but I was wrong I love all the different ways that they find bodies and how they solve them plus all the personal stories behind the victims. the actors in this show are really good I love david boreanaz. and Emily deschannel is perfect as bones. they have a really good chemistry. the show is great the actors are great the stories are great. everything about this show is awesome. but I will have to say that temprence does get a little annoying once in a while. here are the best episodes of season 1. hart hanson has created a great show.
