I highly recommend it. 5 star caliber.",1356048000,2,275,4.411764705882353
5312135,5,B009B0L5L8,"I tuned in to watch Tales of Masked Men knowing very little about the world of Lucha Libre. When my brothers and I were kids we would watch Lucha Libre because it was more fun to watch men with masks on wrestling than it was to watch the ones without. So aside from watching periodically I can say that I never knew the history behind it. Being curious to find out more about the sport I wanted to watch this documentary.

From the beginning I was drawn to the stories of these wrestlers and their origins. I loved the blending of history with the profiles of actual wrestlers past and present. The music, the graphics, the colors all came together and wove a really great show. I highly recommend watching this documentary even if you know very little about the sport. Very informative and well made.",1354320000,11,801,4.486301369863014
5312136,5,B009B0L5L8,"Great Film! I was kept very interested the whole way through. It captured all the excitement of the sport, while the costumes along with the performances made it very theatrical.",1354147200,2,178,4.966666666666667
5312146,5,B009B0L5L8,"If you are a fan of lucha libre,  our even if you are curious as to the mystery and attraction of this very entertaining sport,  I would really recommend this movie.  Very insightful into the world of great entertainment.... Lucha Libre.",1390867200,4,237,4.7317073170731705
5312147,5,B009B0L5L8,"I don't remember how I found out about this Documentary, the only thing I do remember was marking it on my calendar when PBS was going to show it. I was very skeptical about it because I'm a HUGE Lucha Libre fan and I honestly did not want it to come across as a the documentary making fun of it or just talking about the cartoon-y side of Lucha Libre; as people that are not familiar with the sport, they think everything is like Nacho Libre (nothing against that movie) but the sport is much more serious. Well let me tell you, when I saw the Documentary on TV I was pleasantly surprised about how serious the documentary took the sport of Lucha Libre, how detailed they explained it's origins AND they interviewed some serious Luchadores like Solar. For those of you that know the sport it doesn't get more legit than Solar. So that was already a huge plus. I fell in Love with the Documentary and made sure all my friends that liked the sport watched it and even my friends that are not familiar at all with the sport. It is a great executed documentary about a huge cultural piece of Mexican history. This is a great purchase! I already own the DVD but will buy another copy this holiday season for my brother and I suggest you do the same to your loved ones. This will be a great present under the Christmas Tree.",1384128000,3,1319,4.32258064516129
5312148,5,B009B0L5L8,"An excellent documentary! This is the inside scoop of Mexico's largely misunderstood phenomenon. A must-see for fans and a great introduction for those who have never heard of the Mexican tradition of lucha libre, the free fight. Writer-Director-Producer Carlos Avila cuts through the kitschy aspects of what appears to be lucha libre and gets down to the brass tacks- professional Lucha Libre is a serious profession, requiring intense training, conditioning and athleticism. This documentary interviews the experts, authors, archivists and academics who know the long history and traditions of the sport since its origins in the 1930s. But Avila also gets the real deal from the men under the iconic masks- Solar, Mascarita Sagrada and future star, Solar, Jr. There is also a moving tribute to Lucha Libre's greatest idol- El Santo showcasing the Man in the Silver Mask with a rare recording of El Santo's actual voice. Not to be missed. Buy it today!",1383868800,2,953,5.15483870967742
5312149,5,B009B0L5L8,I really liked this documentary. You can tell that the people who filmed it and the ones in the documentary love Lucha Libre and have so much respect for it. My only complaint-I wish it was longer. Great history lesson!,1379808000,6,219,4.5
5312150,4,B009B0L5L8,... but not enough to understand the attraction these characters hold for my students.... Well done documentary and I thought well researched.,1375056000,2,142,5.5
5312151,5,B009B0L5L8,"This is an exceptionally well-done documentary for anyone who is curious about the story behind the commercial images of the masked men.  Filmmaker Carlos Avila and his crew are masterful with their graphic designs as they introduce the basic elements of the world of lucha libre and its real-life characters.  The depth of Avila's exploration gives a lot of dignity to the cultural phenomenon, especially when he backs it up with historical footage and impressive interviews of wrestlers, archivists and film theorists. An added treat is Miguel Sandoval's voice for the film's narration.  One more plus-- you can watch this with your middle school child, and they will comment that it is far more interesting than documentaries they see at school! This was an excellent choice for PBS to air as the season opener for the 2012 ""Voces"" series.",1358726400,,842,5.043165467625899
5312152,5,B009B0L5L8,This documentary and the filmmaker answers that question and more. He successfully unlocks the mistique of Lucha Libre. These wrestlers aren't just putting on a show they are an icon of their municipalities. They represent a culture and in return that culture loves them. This documentary gave me a better understanding and appreciation for Lucha Libre.,1357862400,2,353,5.321428571428571

5312154,5,B009B0L5L8,Before I watched Tales of Masked men I knew nothing about the world of Lucha Libre other than the references I had seen in cartoons. Normally documentary films put me to sleep but this one did just the opposite. The stories and history were very entertaining yet informative at the same time. I highly recommend it to everyone. It was a great film from beginning to end.,1357084800,2,370,4.537313432835821
5312155,5,B009B0L5L8,"Very engaging film! Prior to watching, I knew nothing about the sport aside from the occasional pop culture reference. This movie opened up a world that's very vibrant and heart-felt. Being of Mexican descent I'm proud and relieved to watch such an artistic and respectful approach to our culture. (I wish I could say that about all films). I want to share this movie with everyone!",1356307200,,382,4.803030303030303
8539016,5,B009B0L5L8,This is an utterly fascinating documentary. It takes a look at the wrestling culture not just from the point of view of fans but of the wrestlers themselves.
