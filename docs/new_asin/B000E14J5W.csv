Whether you buy a product on-line, off of the television or from a traditional storefront you need to pay attention to the quality of the product and the accuracy of the financial transaction.  I've had good and bad experiences no matter where I've purchsed a product.  I've used several of Mr. Sheets courses and have learned something from each of them.  As a result I'm succesfully investing in real estate.",1174867200,2,462,4.810126582278481
8103735,1,B000E14J5W,"Carleton Sheets and his ilk are swindlers, nothing

more, nothing less. Anyone who depends on infomercials

to sell their product should automatically be suspect.

He has a 'money back guarantee', evidently, but according

to testimonials found on the internet, not only does he

not give dissatisfied customers their money back, once he

has someone's credit card number, he keeps charging more

and more of his worthless products on it....BEWARE!",1162771200,,448,5.405797101449275
