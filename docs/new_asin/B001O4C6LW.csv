3726961,2,B001O4C6LW,"Same as last reviewer--thought this was going to be a new Set 4, but these two (Road Rage and Simosola) have been out for years.  I bought them several years ago as a set.  Very sneaky--I too almost ordered this before checking out what stories it contained.  Be careful.",1240704000,8,271,4.489795918367347
3726962,3,B001O4C6LW,"Wow, I thought long and hard about buying these, then I decided to rent them from Netflix. I thought I was having deja-vu or mixing the episodes up with some Midsomer Murder episodes. Glad I did not as I already have them. I did not put it together until I was reading these reviews! This did happen to me with Murder in Suburbia. I think this is a bit too sneaky. Not so pleased with Acorn, eh?",1240185600,5,395,4.142857142857143
3726963,4,B001O4C6LW,"""The Ruth Rendell Mysteries Set 4,"" fourth installment of the British television series made by Granada for the United Kingdom's ITV (Independent Television Stations), arrives on these shores.  The shows aired in the UK from 1987-2000; they aired in syndication on public television stations here in the 1990s.  The popular British mystery series is, of course, based on the prolific work of best-selling English crime writer Ruth Rendell, surely one of the most acclaimed, award-winning queens of the contemporary literary psychological mystery/thriller.  The current series consists of two feature -length Inspector Wexford mysteries; it stars George Baker as the Chief Inspector; Christopher Ravenscroft as his deputy, DI Mike Burden.  The set consists of two DVDs, runs approximately 353 minutes, and includes a bonus program, ""Super Sleuths."" Each of these episodes has been previously available individually.  The set lacks subtitles, and could use them, as all Rendell's well-brought up characters speak softly.

Episode 1.  Simisola.  Wexford's Nigerian-born doctor privately asks the Inspector to find his 22-year old daughter Melanie, who has suddenly disappeared.  The effort to track Melanie will lead to two murders, and develop into an emotionally-charged case heavily influenced by issues of race and class.

Episode 2.  Road Rage.  Rendell's favorite town, Kingsmarkham, is in an uproar as environmental activists disrupt the construction of a local highway bypass.  The body of a young and beautiful long-missing German tourist turns up in the nearby woods: she has been sexually assaulted and strangled.  A group that claims to consist of radical environmental activists kidnaps several villagers for leverage, Wexford's wife among them.

By American standards, Grandpa Wexford looks old enough to be long retired from the police, but what do we know?  The series is deliciously filmed, on location in the English countryside and its small cities, and there are sufficient cars, character actors, and extras to give the productions a realistic look.  Granada has really not stinted in the making of these.  And each episode builds to a powerful conclusion, despite the fact that they are not based on the author's top-notch work, but are based on works perhaps too limited by convention, political correctness, and the 1990's headlines of the day.  ""Simisola,"" in particular, reminds me of Sam Goldwyn's well-known witticism, ""When I want to send a message I'll use Western Union.""

Mind you, as a woman and a human being, I strongly approve of this specific message, and believe Rendell has a right to send it, but the mystery does suffer for it.  Be that as it may, you have two absorbing mysteries here, and mystery lovers who do not already own these separately should welcome them.",1239494400,12,2804,5.341685649202733
3726964,3,B001O4C6LW,I bought this set thinking it was new stuff---no wonder the old set is no longer being manufactured  because Acorn has re-packaged Simisola/Road Rage with new picture on cover--I was so disappointed when I went to play and saw that I already had these stories--to be fair--did not play...Maybe Acorn inproved something.--I bought this set in MARCH BEFORE Amazon finally showed the episodes included ---my star rating is NOT for the stories or even QUALITY of the tapes but to make YOU AWARE of what is being offered--NEW COVER does not mean NEW STORIES..,1238803200,16,554,4.8936170212765955
3726965,5,B001O4C6LW,"These two episodes have been out on single DVDs for years.  I would not expect many sales, as true fans already own both.  Hopefully, poor sales will not deter more sets in the series, as I will certainly buy those.
More Inspector Wexford, please!!",1238112000,3,248,4.613636363636363

8329348,2,B001O4C6LW,I can't believe the ending. Left not knowing what happened. Is there a set five to conclude Road Rage?,1481155200,,102,4.421052631578948
8329349,5,B001O4C6LW,"I seem to have collected the whole series, so that tells you that I am a fan of Ruth Rendell.  What you must take into account is that most of the storylines were shown on TV in the UK over 30 years ago, so some of the methods are of that time, but it is still  enjoyable to watch.
There are some excellent used sellers out there, so give them a try and see if it's for you.",1473897600,2,374,3.782051282051282
8329350,2,B001O4C6LW,"It was surprising to find, after reading various reviews complaining that there weren't more Inspector Wexford episodes in the Ruth Rendell sets, that these episodes are the absolute worst of her mysteries.  The acting is abominable:  Wexford is a loud-mouth bore with little compassion for his suspects or family, who he yells at if crossed;  his partner is a constantly-smiling wimp who sucks up to Wexford (but hates 'tree-huggers' as terrorists) while prejudging suspects. The scenes between Wexford and his wife are cloying and embarrassing.  The subjects and stories are not only the most unpleasant of this series but, indeed, of any British series I have ever seen.

The writing is the worst of all the mysteries available.  The police come off as arrogant and uncaring, with personal bias dictating all their attitudes towards people who have the misfortune to encounter them.  The stories lack the interest and cleverness of other mysteries in the series.

A few of the supporting actors fare better but, in general, there is way too much screaming and carrying on.  The shrill whine of consternation from way too many characters caused me to fast-forward through these seemingly endless, and needlessly noisy, scenes.  It is amazing that, if these representations are in any way accurate, that there is a normal, well-adjusted person in the British Isles.

Other of the mysteries contain similar elements, but these two episodes are by far the most egregious.  Not a good way to cap off an otherwise decent series.  In addition, there are several characters who have changed since the earlier Wexford episode (Harm Done) -- and certainly do nothing to improve the quality.  The new wife, particularly, is simpering and annoying.  George Baker and Christopher Ravenscourt are dreadful actors, difficult to watch, and far too old for their parts.",1463270400,,1855,5.157190635451505

8329354,2,B001O4C6LW,"It is more than annoying that these otherwise fine productions are chopped up -- apparently suited for the insertion of commericials.  They must originally have run in segments -- why else would you have credits in the middle AND at the end?

Sometimes,I had to fish around to find the proper order

I would not buy another one.",1252368000,2,328,4.620689655172414
