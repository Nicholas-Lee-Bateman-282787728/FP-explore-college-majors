2581023,5,B000FOT9QM,"This is an excellent DVD.  I'm showing it in my Earth Science classes when we cover the history of oceanography.  One of the questions I ask my students is, ""What is Ballard's greatest discovery?""  The answer is, ""His next one.""",1269388800,,228,4.65
2581024,4,B000FOT9QM,"I ordered this video for a bioethics college course that I'm teaching.  In general, it's entertaining and well presented.  It certainly provokes several interesting topics for discussion, but I wish the video contained a more in-depth analysis in addition to its ""straight-ahead reporting"".",1250553600,,290,5.72093023255814
2581025,3,B000FOT9QM,"I ordered the video hoping that I would learn something new about Dave and his story...I've read The Total Money Makeover and everything that was in there was in the video as far as content.  The video did show his family and talked about his financial seminars.  It wasn't worth the $17 in my opinion.  If you want to learn more about personal finances I suggest his books, or DVDs like Maxed Out or In Debt We Trust.  This was more of an interview that talks about what he talks about everyday on his radio show.",1225324800,2,514,4.322916666666667
2581026,3,B000FOT9QM,"The DVD carries some good information on MRSA. It is current and easy to understand.  However, it is very expensive for less than 12 minutes of video.  You might think there is an hour of video time - 60 Minutes - Superbug. Instead, it is less than 12 minutes of actual footage from the 60 Minutes program.  It is overpriced at $17.95 plus shipping.  I paid $25 for the DVD and it works out that it is >$2.00 a minute. Otherwise, the information is timely.",1216080000,,456,4.329411764705882
2581027,1,B000FOT9QM,"I remember when 60 minutes aired this piece.  New Orleans and south La were in pain and our own country could not decide if they would help us or not.  In the middle of all this 60 minutes ran this piece, from a man who is not an expert in the field, saying New Orleans is doomed anyway.  The city, the local CBS affiliate and LSU Geology tried to stop the airing, or at least get their views aired to balance it, because it was clap trap.  60 Minutes refused.  New Orleans is still alive due to the heroism of its citizens and volunteers from all over the world.  I hope you never have to experience the devastation we had (and still live with) in the Gulf South and experience the abandonment we felt by the very people that should have been the ones getting on the government for their lies, cronyism and incompetence.",1206230400,,821,4.298701298701299
2581028,5,B000FOT9QM,This was something the school districts needed to see. There are salesmen out there selling chemicals we didn't need at a cost double our current sanitizing chemicals. Hygiene is the root to most of the problems and using  sanitizing chemicals which we rotate helps keep bacteria in check. Our athletic department now uses this DVD for educating the students on the need for good hygiene. Thank you 60 minutes...........,1198886400,2,420,5.086956521739131
2581029,5,B000FOT9QM,"I thought this was a very interesting 60 minutes show on the death row inmate, in carefully observing this inmate, he seems very sincere and frank to the questions ask by the interviewer, although it is very aparent that he is indwelt by some internal interference; and that he lacks the power to  induce the normal feature of conflict resolution because either one or the other is in total control and either leaves room for argument. Clearly he is guilty of murder but the mind of an insaine person is like a body of a car it can drive but not without being driven and there a driving forces that people in his condition are ruled by until the damage is done. The force then leaves the vehicle high and dry with nowhere to turn.  Sometimes I believe little remorse is exhibited because the assumed member of the body did not participate and if there is remorse it is a natual response that individual would have to any deed as such it depends on the originators makeup and not the invaders, the invaders leave after the deed(if you will)causeing the originator to appear a foolish and hardened criminal instead of the vehicle.  These conditions are oppourtunities to examine people at much younger ages to discover mental illness early on and create a stronger awareness of this reality.  Resulting in proper medications early before things are out of control, setting up facilities and accountability for these victims of the mind, who do not have enough power over their own mind or existance to over rule negative influence. Mental illness is running rampid and swept under the rug, so of the most successful people in the world are mentally ill as quiet as it is kept, yet as long as the deeds of the mind are kept under close wraps it's ok, until someone less fortunate goes to the extreme and has no way out except to take the  rap of the invador of the mind, whom is very real and completely invisible just like what may be considered a medium or demonic influence, who knows the persons past and infections that can be used for weakening and weakness.  I know this sounds out there to some, those some are the ones most succeptable because of disbelief of such invasion of space and time.
Quiet as it's kept I believe fear plays a major role in type of discovery not being very popular yet there are those who do know.  For those who know and can do something I guess there's a weakness  there also, because belief is not always supported by the tangible proof that we seek, it's either you see it or you don't, and studies and proof, can often get in the way of our natural God given abilities and gifts, given to us in order to handle such invasive territory as the mind and spirit combat that we all encounter and some worse than others; in the Bible all of the thou shall nots were of the same magnitude of judgement, we are the ones who decided to give them levels, God...just said ""thou shalt not"", all in the same tone, so I believe this man should live somewhere deep down under the hurt and pain and terror of life it's self is a man who needs to be free and he was locked up far before his inprisonment.  Being in prison is not the worst of his life the torment must be far greater than all elese. Understanding the Misunderstood, these are highly intellegent individuals whose mental gaps become portals to be invaided by the unseen enemy of mankind.  I am praying for this man, and what he may have left of a life. These are all victims, him, the victim the mother's who says she forgives him but, I find it confusing that a forgiving person can also request a deathwish for the same person forgiven, this is not forgiveness, and something indwells this personality also; so thank
God for the judicial systems which may or may not work in his favor , but at least there are more than one chance that he'll have a chance; to live that is but now who will step into his life and help to remove the layers of death and errosion on him that he may be truly free not from jail but from the bondage of his life. If could ever be a consideration then there will be a chance for other confined to the attic or the basement. I guess God should have given up on the entire human race when Jesus Christ, was killed, instead Jesus Christ, himself said forgive for they know not what they do, not kill them for killing me,that I died for them to have a chance to live and I want to see them have this chance and these were supposedly sane people...if you will...So I believe Jesus Christ, was  Understanding the Misunderstood, and for that I had the chance to be born,and head toward Heaven and live life eternally.  God Bless this man
even if his physical life is taken I see that he has a heart, eventhough it has been waxed cold by life and mental illness, I believe that with each breath we take there is life and hope hanging in the balance.  This is all so sad and real I pray God''s will is what prevails in this matter.  Sharon L. Mays ---- Watching 60 minutes",1194825600,,4977,4.395652173913043
2581030,4,B000FOT9QM,"Jay has now completed his 5th Symohony (198 pages) which was written at the age of thirteen.  It has been recorded for Sony BMG in the same studios where the Beatles' songs were recorded.  This fifth composition was played by the London Symphony Orchestra in England,

He was not your normal twelve year old, not interested in sports.  He was bored to distraction in history class.  He sees music as a hobby, and not his destiny.  He hears the music in his head at the speed of light.  He hums what's channeled to him as he walks.  He is the musical Einstein.

At the age of ten,  he enrolled at Julliard.  Now, at the age of fourteen, he is a 3rd year college student.  Jay need to question his 'gift' like Beethoven and studies piano lessons.  He played cello at the age of three. He had started writing music at the age of two.  His mother is Israli and father lost his sight at the age of 36.

At twelve years, he became known as a musical prodigy and declares that ""it comes right the first time.""  He writes the music for each instrument of the orchestra even though he has not played them.  He write ""when I am inspired;"" when one long session is completed, he starts another immediately.  I fear he will burn out before he reaches twenty.  He writes what he has imagined and when asked ""who can really define happiness"" he answers ""keeping one's mind challenged.""

This was a good documentary filmed both in America and Britain as he takes his bows after the performance of his 5th Symphony.  He may know music, but I would advise him to change his mind about history, as that is where we come from and is to be the result of our family heritage and genes as to what his future holds for him.  He is an inspiration to all.",1164585600,,1730,4.32398753894081
8125168,5,B000FOT9QM,An excellent film but its not for sale now. Why not? I wanted to order it for my class.,1505779200,,87,3.6315789473684212
8125169,1,B000FOT9QM,"OMG less than 14 minutes?!?!??
If you saw the show on Broadway, leave it at that!!! For a Spider-Man Fan and a kid at heart the live show was Great!!! This EXTREMELY SHORT CLIP is NOT worth the $18 bucks nor the anticipation while waiting for it to arrive in the mail!!!! They don't go into detail about any lawsuits injuries or any of the ""controversy"" that the show faced with its investors insurance lawsuits etc.
It's probably better to wait and hope for a full-length DVD of the live-action Broadway show on DVD which hopefully will be released some day with DVD extras that include the information that should've been on this one as well as this quickie clip as well...
For now save your money!",1410566400,,700,4.519685039370079
8125170,5,B000FOT9QM,Needed this for a book report. Great read,1409875200,,41,4.25
8125171,3,B000FOT9QM,It was instructive but unfortunetly the internet is making things easier to find and to learn about it if you have further questions.,1357430400,,133,4.826086956521739
8125172,4,B000FOT9QM,"good items to keep for the future, not likely will someone overtake his medal totals.  order it for your family",1353888000,,111,4.55
8125173,5,B000FOT9QM,I have used this DVD in educational programs.  Everyone loves it.  I would hightly recommend it to others.  It is well narrated.,1335916800,,128,4.7272727272727275
8125174,5,B000FOT9QM,A good look into the US Army and its roll in the war in Iraq and the roll of United States Central Command.,1316822400,,107,3.6956521739130435
8125175,3,B000FOT9QM,The DVD had good interviews with folks who are terrorist.  It shows how dedicated and driven they are to their views.  The DVD is way to short in run time for the cost.  I would not buy it again.,1316649600,,195,3.948717948717949
8125176,2,B000FOT9QM,"I saw this episode a couple weeks ago when it was broadcast. It was pretty interesting! With interviews from the musical's director as well as Bono and the Edge, it was a fascinating glimpse into a Broadway production that, I have a sense, has thousands of investors who each own 50% of the show.

Good though it was, that doesn't explain the issuing just that segment, on a DVD, at what is currently an eighteen dollar price point. This is foolishness. That's better than a dollar a minute for something you can stream on Hulu for way cheaper. This is quite possibly one of the stupidest, most pointless products I've ever seen available.",1292284800,17,639,4.654867256637168
8125177,5,B000FOT9QM,"This 13 minute segment is a bit expensive at $18, but is also available on YouTube. Just search on CBS 60 Minutes Pelndaba and it should come up. I've ordered a copy because that may disappear and I actively educate on the issue and prefer having the easy to use DVD format. Plus I can skip the annoying commercials this way.

This short  piece conveys the danger of nuclear terrorism -- and the danger of society's complacency on the issue -- better than anything I've seen. Matthew Bunn's MIT thesis ""Guardians at the Gates of Hell"" has much more information, and I highly recommend it (also available on line in PDF). But for sheer emotion, this one is tops.

A comparison to the Nuclear Tipping Point DVD (free from NTI, again a search will find it) is also in order. That is also a must see, with the two videos complementing one another. Attack at Pelindaba is gripping, while Nuclear Tipping Point is convincing. For people like me who lived through the Viet Nam era, it will be amazing to hear Henry Kissinger say what he does in NTP. Watch them both!",1285632000,,1059,4.505208333333333
