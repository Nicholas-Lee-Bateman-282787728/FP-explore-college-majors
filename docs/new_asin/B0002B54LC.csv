2074313,5,B0002B54LC,"Our 18 month old got a hand-me-down video from her older cousins.  It was Pingu ""Artic Antics"", a claymation video about penguins going about life as we do.  At first it seemed odd which made us keep watching.  The characters have their own odd language but each one has so much personality.  There are several short stories which are easy to follow.  They are funny situations with good values and life lessons.  They are very creative stories about Pingu, his baby sister Pinga and his penguin family and friends.  Our two year old wants to watch it everyday and we love it too.  Since there isn't much talking, it is easy for her to fall asleep watching it at night.  We now have bought 'Meet Pingu' and 'Chillin' with Pingu' which we love.  We would buy all the Pingu DVD's if they were available.",1143158400,3,801,4.5
2074314,5,B0002B54LC,"My son (3yrs old) got his first glimpse of Pingu as a Hit Extra on a Bob the Builder DVD. He loved it so much, we had to play it over and over and over for him. He would shout Pingu! Pingu! Pingu! until I pushed play again. So getting this DVD in the mail today was great. He woke up crabby (crying) from his nap, but we popped in the DVD and he snapped right out of his bad mood. Now I only have to watch 8 episodes over and over again instead of the same one. I, too have watched it with him and some of the scenes are so funny, I can't but help laughing really loud. Too bad there aren't more DVDs for purchase, cuz we would buy them all. The Hit Extras on this are a nice bonus, but the Rubbadubbers is the same episode as on a Bob the Builder DVD, but my son doesn't seem to mind. If you or your kids like Pingu at all, you'll love this DVD.",1132531200,7,846,3.785310734463277
2074315,4,B0002B54LC,My grandson likes it and has seen it several times.  He still likes it!,1126051200,,71,4.071428571428571
2074316,5,B0002B54LC,"I have to admit, I was a little skeptical before I rented my first Pingu video. But not only does my toddler love the claymation, my older ones do too - and even I got a kick out of them. Funny and universal due to no language used, I've even recommended them for my toddler neice who is half Japanese and can barely understand any English yet. Being able to tell a good story is wonderful, being able to tell a good story that older and younger both appreciate is even better - and being able to tell a good story without using words of any kind is just...wow! I'm impressed. Not only is Pingu cute, his stories are fun and educational! Now we've purchased all available and are eagerly waiting for more!",1121731200,13,705,4.30827067669173
2074317,3,B0002B54LC,"I watched and am writing this review of Pingu from the perspective of an adult who has no children, but I do enjoy claymation, especially from non-US sources.

There are a few laugh-out-loud moments.  I would compare this to a cross between Teletubbies and Wallace & Gromit, with the weight solidly on the Teletubbies side.  You find very simple and repetitive story lines.  Without true dialogue, of course, you miss the wittiness and verbal banter of W&G, and the creators rely much more heavily on sight-gags and prat-falls, which with claymation can be quite funny.

Pingu is a lot of fun, though I might suggest NOT watching them all back2back.  Try watching a cut every morning when you are at your grumpiest, or at night when you need a good, simple laugh.

Will adults like it?  I did!

2074318,4,B0002B54LC,"Ok well HIT almost got this one right but I think the bonus stuff is annoying and it tells me HIT is short-changing the fans of Pingu to push other product.  To me, as my son could care less about the ""bonus features"", this just means less Pingu on the DVD.
Given the poor options available in the US.  I'd say start here before you buy the tryuly atrociously packaged but never-the-less worthwhile ""Meet Pingu"" as this one (thanks to the menu) will spare your sanity.
Having said that, Pingu is  a wonderful stop-motion series from Swizerland that really desreves a better release in the states.  Pingu and his friends are charming and the stories don't talk down to kids.  Your kids will love it!
I only wish the people at HIT Entertainment loved it too.",1089590400,14,756,4.529411764705882
2074319,5,B0002B54LC,Very clever. Children are engrossed by this and it can be quite amusing for adults also. It takes skill to tell stories so clearly without words.,1367107200,,145,4.615384615384615
2074320,5,B0002B54LC,"I'm 28 and adore Pingu. He's hilarious and entertaining and if I ever have kids, I'm definitely forcing them to watch this.",1365206400,,123,4.636363636363637
2074321,4,B0002B54LC,This is a different kind of cartoon.  There is no dialogue just the penguins acting out all kinds of problems.  This is the second one that we have shown our grand kids and they really like it!,1362528000,,193,4.1891891891891895
2074322,5,B0002B54LC,It is a simple funny show. The characters do not use words but kids easily get all their interactions. Stories are cute and show everyday life situation. My 2 year old loves it ;),1362009600,,179,4.294117647058823
2074323,5,B0002B54LC,"4 yr old son really liked this show. Picture was good and didn't have any 'buffering' issues. Cute little penguin, silly show for kids.",1361923200,,135,4.666666666666667
2074324,5,B0002B54LC,"I love the simplicity of Pingu, yet so much is going on. I watch these with my grandaughter and she LOVES them.",1361923200,,111,4.090909090909091

2074326,5,B0002B54LC,"One is never too old for pingu, a typical mischievous penguin who will remind us all of ourselves our siblings and our own children. I love all the episodes but am fond of the snow board scene where the three friends show a slight fear of taking that first run down a really big hill but conquer their fear and bumps to continue on and have fun.
The childhood situations are so typical and handled with such grace. What a show.",1360368000,,427,4.283950617283951
2074327,5,B0002B54LC,"Pingu was also a character shown on PBS Kids (Sprout) that my oldest watched.  We loved watching him and his antics, the wah wah wah voice (sort of wished for sub-titles..)  My youngest loves him and also refers to him as the ""Naughty Little Penguin""  Our favorite episode remains the one where his parents go to the opera and are lucky the igloo is still standing when they return (how Pingu got his ""Naughty Little Penguin"" moniker in our house)...",1356566400,,450,4.6
2074328,5,B0002B54LC,"When I was a child I used to watch Pingu's show, so when it first came to DVD I bought it for my three kids (6y/4y/2y) , they keep watching it over and over again. It has like 8 episodes and also some bonus shows, such as Angelina Ballerina and Rubber Dubbers.",1286928000,,260,4.019230769230769
2074329,5,B0002B54LC,My son is 6 and he still likes to watch it from time to time. Pingu made him laugh since he was 2 yo and he still laughs watching it. And I like it too!,1256256000,,152,3.3714285714285714
2074330,1,B0002B54LC,"not at all what I was expecting. Appparently with the sucess of the serie they became more sophisticated and it did not help the quality of the product. In the earlier pingu it moves slow and it's funny. Now the filiming technic is too quick which does fit the type of animation, quite agressiv alomost with loud music. I unfortunately purchased 3 titles simultanaously! My kids who loved the earlier version don't want to watch those.",1243728000,2,435,4.7368421052631575
2074331,5,B0002B54LC,Pingu is such a lovely character. The themes are gentle and recognisable and the DVD is full of action. My very active 3 year old boy just loves this movie. Adults and older children - watch out for some unexpected moments of humour!,1242950400,,233,4.441860465116279
2074332,5,B0002B54LC,My 18 month old loved the little Pingu skits that would show up on tv but they just weren't long enough!  I read some of the reviews on other Pingu dvd's and this one seemed to be the best rated.  This dvd is full of different episodes and so funny!  We LOVE Pingu!,1239580800,,265,3.9622641509433962
2074333,5,B0002B54LC,"My two year old has always enjoyed Pingu, but now he truly appreciates the humor and laughs big belly laughs when watching this DVD especially.  He was even Pingu for Halloween this year, and gave a little Pingu impersonation at each house we visited.  He Loves Pingu!",1226707200,,268,4.680851063829787
2074334,5,B0002B54LC,This is great fun if you enjoy slap stick comedy in which no langue is spoken.,1223510400,,78,3.9375

2074336,5,B0002B54LC,"My 2 1/2 year old grandson loved the first Pingu so I bought this one. This one is even beter. We both LOVE the ""birth"" scene with the nurse helping the baby hatch from the egg.  It also shows the reality of having a new baby in the house, complete with Pingu having to run the tissue with the baby poo to the toilet. And of course, Pingu is jealous of his new sister.

I wish there were more Pingus!",1215216000,,400,3.9875

2074338,5,B0002B54LC,"I've never heard him laugh so hard! The first episode had my son rolling on the sofa, unable to contain himself.  After many viewings, he still laughs heartily while he watches the dancing egg.  I don't find it nearly as entertaining, but love it that he loves it so much.

Just a little warning- Pingu and his new sister Pinga can be pretty naughty and they might give little ones some ideas for mischief...but it's nothing out of the norm and it's all in good fun.",1200096000,4,466,4.395348837209302
2074339,5,B0002B54LC,I remember being an older teen and loving when Pingu would come on one of the Canadian stations.  I purchased this to share the love with my kids; my 3 year old and 6 year old were laughing out loud while they watched Pingu and his antics.,1199577600,,239,4.085106382978723
2074340,3,B0002B54LC,My 15mos old daughter enjoys this dvd but it's not her favorite and I think it's a little weird that there aren't any words.,1199145600,,124,4.208333333333333
2074341,4,B0002B54LC,We first saw Pingu as an extra on a Hit produced dvd a couple years back. My son has since always checked his dvds to see if there would be Pingu extras. He was ecstatic to receive an entire DVD of all pingu. and it was even better because now Pingu has a baby sister--just like he does. I thought Pingu was a little weird at first but now am just as entertained as the kids.,1198713600,,375,3.9473684210526314
2074342,5,B0002B54LC,"This the second DVD released by HIT entertainment in its Pingu series. The first one was titled 'Meet Pingu'. Unlike the first DVD, this one has a menu and some supplementary material (Pingu photos). DVD has 8 epsidoes of Pingu. Once again, HIT entertainment could have added more episodes/material on the DVD. The content of the DVD is great as usual (see my other review for the Meet Pingu DVD for content overview). It's way superior that most cartoons that come on TV/cable (PBS, Disney, Nick) these days.",1169078400,6,509,4.795454545454546
2074343,5,B0002B54LC,"My boyfriend showed me 2 episodes of Pingu online, and we both agreed: it was the cutest, funniest thing we've seen in a long time.  I got Chillin with Pingu for him for Christmas, and when we watched it, we laughed through the whole thing.  Yes, it's a great movie for young children, but it's also entertaining for adults.  Pingu is an amazing character, and the stories are universal.  Deffinately worth watching.",1169078400,2,416,4.736111111111111
2074344,4,B0002B54LC,"My son (age 3) loves Pignu and thinks these DVDs are hilarious.  However, Pignu is a tad mischievous and has planted some ideas that I'd rather he hadn't because my son imitates everything.  I would still have bought them but might have waited one more year.  The series is terrific.",1168473600,4,283,4.62
2074345,4,B0002B54LC,"Pingu and his family and friends warm the hearts of all ages and cultures. Babies understand his language instinctively and grown-ups have the strange feeling that they knew it in the past!

  After falling in love with Pingu, we searched for more of his adventures and found them at Amazon...and we are ready for more!",1168473600,,319,4.763636363636364
2074346,5,B0002B54LC,My son loves these DVDs!  Pingu leaves him rolling in the floor and begging for more.  I wish the creator would make more of these and I definitely wish I had found them sooner!  Great fun.,1168300800,,189,4.194444444444445
2074347,5,B0002B54LC,"I have been reading some comments about Pingu's shorts. Most of them are delighted parents (either by Pingu's adventures or by the effect they have on thier offspring) and claymation fans eager to get more of Pingu's episodes.

Well, here it is. Still Amazon, but through its french franchise, offers those additional chapters you have been looking for. So, if you are not afraid of money exchange (prices vary from EUR 16.51 to EUR 20.20), then go for ""pingu"" in Amazon.fr's browser.

Bottomline: As you can expect, being a european release, DVDs are Region 2. Be warned since they will only run on multiregion or region-free DVD players and/or computers with supported DVD players.",1149206400,,683,4.982456140350878

8025523,5,B0002B54LC,"And more fun.  I'm always surprised that we come back to Pingu over and over, and the kids still laugh out loud at his antics and problems.  Waking that spontaneous laughter from kids is not an easy trick. Pingu achieves it.",1397779200,,224,4.439024390243903
8025524,5,B0002B54LC,"Very enjoyable in a quirky kind of way.  There are no real words, just a lot of jibberish.  Adult family members have gotten hooked on Pingu by watching it at my house during the holidays.",1386547200,,188,4.3428571428571425
