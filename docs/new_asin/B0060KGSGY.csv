8490448,5,B0060KGSGY,"For Singles Only was released in 1968. Starring Mary Ann Mobley, John Saxon, Chris Noel, and Lana Wood this is a lot of fun, and with the cast you know what you're in for. The goings on of young people living in an apartment complex. Hmmm...Wonder where Melrose Place got their idea for a show? One of those so bad it's good films.",1436400000,,331,4.26984126984127

8490450,5,B0060KGSGY,This 1967 movie was really enjoyable to watch and it is quite tame compared to todays movies. Milton Berle although starting to age was sharp and witty as always. I enoyed the musical scores particularily the one from the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. The body psycedelic body painting was really cool. There was both romance and heartbreak something that singles always have to encounter. I guess I just found it interesting because of the 60's era and the beautiful actresses really shined. It was mostly fun to watch!!,1347235200,9,515,4.863636363636363
