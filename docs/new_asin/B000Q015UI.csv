8193972,5,B000Q015UI,"Le roman de un tricheur (The novel of a cheater) is an amusing, brilliant and mordacious movie that deals with the memories (told in off) of a man, since his early childhood until the present. Plenty of smart humor, from the very beginning, with a very imaginative script that will lead us from a small French village to Monaco, his occurrences are hovered by acidic comments and laughable situations from start to finish. Fine performances of all the cast, plus the superb talent of Sacha Guitry, make of this film one of my most beloved French films ever made.

Go for this extraordinary dramatic comedy that will plainly fulfill all your expectations.",1189382400,,654,4.839285714285714
