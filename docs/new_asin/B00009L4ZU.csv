7991170,1,B00009L4ZU,THAT THE AND1 MIXTAPE VOL.3 WILL GONNA TEACH ME HOW TO PLAY A BASKET I SEEN VOL.123 NOT VOL 4 PLEASE CAN I SEE IT PLEASE,1098403200,3,120,3.6538461538461537
7991171,4,B00009L4ZU,"Don't get it twisted it was too short, but so was the first 3 volumes, after 4 dropped and was longer that the first 3 you forgot about how short the Mix Tapes are anyways. The Sauce's Crosses was way too short, if you have the ESPN Series 1 on DVD you'll see what you really misssed. And y'all complaining about Vol. 6, just wait until Vol. 7 (I got it early, 50 himself sold it to me for $15 @ the Atl Open Run) and that one is going up there as the Classics like Vol. 3 and 4 (sorry but Vol. 1 will remain the best) but Vol. 7 is off the Chain, but for you other people less fortunate (yeah I can't spell so what, NBA Athletes can't read) as me, just wait until Aug 31st you'll see.",1092614400,,685,3.8652482269503547
7991172,3,B00009L4ZU,"I bought this the day it came out off of amazon and couldn't wait to see it. Most of the alimoe footage was actually already released footage off of the ""alimoe vs. skip "" battle tape that footaction gave to you for free when you bought anything And 1. Sauce's Crosses was way too short, and they need to get away from all of the interviews and get back to showing more game footage. Maybe in the future they will even have it broken up into different segments on dunks, tricks, crosses, and defense. Volume 1 and 3 still reigns supreme for me.",1073952000,,544,4.29126213592233
7991173,4,B00009L4ZU,"After the disappointment that was Volume 5, AND1, purveyors of the nasty, borderline-illegal, ankle-breaking streetball moves, went back to what they were best at: true streetball footage against people actually trying to defend against being put to shame.
Longtime streetball fanatics will love the new addition of an old favorite: Alimoe a.k.a. the Black Widow, a Harlem native with an already established rep at legendary Rucker Park (you can catch him in the Entertainer's Basketball Classic Season 1 DVD). Ali-baba is the consumnate streetballer: great handles and tricks, solid defense, a jumpshot and enough ups to make highlights--Hot Sauce, 50 and Skip all rolled into one. Jaws will drop for newer fans of the Mixtape series as Alimoe takes his smooth-but-tough NYC style around the country. Nearly a third of the DVD and the first 10 minutes are pure Black Widow.
Noticeably absent are finishers Main Event and 50, whose appear sparingly with Vol. 5 debutante High Octane throwing a majority of the sick oops down. Hot Sauce, Shane, Headache, AO and Sik Wit It put up most of the highlights, but the producers give a pretty big chunk of the video to local ballers holding their own.
Don't worry about hitting the rewind button to watch someone's ankle's break again; there is no shortage of instant replays, even up to five or six times per play. However, they get a little too creative with the video work sometimes, making some plays difficult to enjoy.
Now for the money...you wanna know about the tricks. There's a fair share of old familiars--the ball through the opponent's legs, the ball on the head, the big cross--but Vol. 6 does bring some new hash to the pipe. You'll see new spins on old tricks, and sick new variations to the good ol' spin move, courtesy of Alimoe.
Watch the video all the way through for the ""Hidden Track"" featuring grainy tournament to high school to college footage of NBA stars Shawn ""The Matrix"" Marion, Stephon ""Starbury"" Marbury"" and Rafer ""Skip To My Lou"" Alston, as well as Alimoe. The ""Sauce's Crosses"" section is merely a short, short, short montage of maybe one or two broken ankles, and a ton of just big crossovers. The ""Garage Battles"" is a fair warning to AND1 wannabes to NOT, I repeat, NOT send in tapes of yourself when your skill level is AND None.
Way too short of a video...it seems as though too much emphasis was placed on interviewing players and fans, wasting five to 10 precious minutes that could've been streetball.
Those who decided not to buy the ESPN Streetball DVD and instead wait for this to come out may want to go back and buy that package. It'll be a nice complement to this DVD and has tons of stuff that never even shows up in Vol. 6.
A cool, old school return to the grainy, tournament footage-style of mixtapes that put AND1 on the map. If only they played it 10 minutes more.",1065312000,8,2860,4.722
7991174,3,B00009L4ZU,"I rated this a 4 because it is ""And 1"" afterall. But i was not too impressed. Dont get me wrong there was some sick moves, and tight beats, but it was to short and alls they showed was ali and sauce. What im sayin is, u put everyone else in the video and it makes it 20-30 minutes longer. Make me wait another month, and put some more effort in it. but what the hell, It is ""And 1"" so you gotsta pick it up.",1064620800,3,407,3.744186046511628
7991175,1,B00009L4ZU,"And 1 mix tape 6 is good, but it is short, and focuses mostly on Alimoe. Mix tape 5 showed everyone behind the scenes and on the court, at many different places. Mix tape 6 showed all Alimoe, some hotsauce, and very little of anyone else, at about 3 different locations. Sauces crosses is tight, and **** up is fun to watch (mainly cus everyone is either falling or making someone fall). the music is hot, and I have to admit Alimoe has some bangin moves, but it's called THE AND1 MIX TAPE TOUR, Not the Alimoe Mixtape tour. they need more footage of the other players, I cannot stress this enough. It was good though, short, but good.",1064016000,2,635,4.34453781512605
7991176,3,B00009L4ZU,"And 1 started of with a Skinny kid named Rafer Alston aka Skip to My Lou he put on a Basketball show in And 1 mixtape vol 1. Now after five mixtapes later Comes And 1 vol 6 which shows the game of Hotsauce,AO and Alimoe. Vol6 is good the DVD extras are ok Sauces Crosses is the best part of the extras. My main problem wit vol6 is that its toooooo short. Other than that it ok it could have been better",1063843200,,402,3.855421686746988
7991177,2,B00009L4ZU,"Volume 6 is only 40 minutes long, #5 is like an hour and 20. The special features on #6 aren't so special. I liked how they did a city by city thing in volume 5. Volume 6 mainly focuses on Alimoe and Hotsauce, its not bad and I don't regret buying it. This dvd did not show off the 2003 tour real well. I'm sure there will be a better 2003 tour dvd later.",1063756800,,355,3.810810810810811
