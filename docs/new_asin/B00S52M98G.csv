The time frame is carefully and perfectly chosen, 1932. turmoil in India was getting pretty out of hands, not totally yet though. the cruelty, insults, Indians have suffered, divided loyalty, people of same nationality against each other , divided..it truly is a masterpiece. a must watch.

6959149,5,B00S52M98G,"This was a real favorite of mine...gorgeous scenery and great character development wonderfully woven together with drama, humor, history and music.  Although I'd viewed it on TV several times, I purchased season 1 and still enjoy it. Eagerly awaited season 2 and hoping it will go to a 3rd season.  It's difficult to choose a favorite character, as the acting was superb! Some may refer to this as a ""soap"" but it has far more historic  realism and artistry than that.  I learned so much about the racial, religious, political and social conflicts in post British India and came to realize what a complicated social and religious mix India was and how challenging it must have been for Gandhi to bring India together.",1479772800,3,718,4.813008130081301

6959155,5,B00S52M98G,"I missed the first season of Indian Summers.  Frankly, I had not heard about it.  When I saw that the second season was starting I figured it would check out at least the first episode of the first season to see if it was worth watching.  I started the first episode about 4:00 on the afternoon.  At 10:30 I was on episode 6 or so. By Sunday evening when the second season started I had watched all 10 episodes.  It's wonderful.

The first few episodes set up the characters and it can be a little confusing because you are trying to figure out how these characters and subplots will come together.  By episode 3 or 4 they all start coming together.

The second season is three years after the events in the first season.

If you liked Downton Abbey you will love Indian Summers!",1473811200,,779,4.354166666666667

6959195,5,B00S52M98G,"I find it perplexing that some complain because the series wasn't shot in India. Dr. Zhivago wasn't shot in Siberia or Russia. It also wasn't shot during the revolution or the war. Downtown Abbey wasn't shot in early 19th century England, either. And the servants weren't real servants. Imagine that!

I love Indian Summers. The scenery alone is magnificent, no matter where it is. There are a lot of mysteries that are slowly unfolding and we're taken into an era of terrible upheaval that includes bigotry and class struggles by both the English and the Indians. Unfortunately, racism and class struggles were a way of life in India at that time.

The British and English were thrown together and yet despised if, like Ralf Whelan and his sister, they fall in love with the wrong people. We take these alliances for granted in our time but falling in love with someone who's skin color is darker in an invaded India during the late 1800's brands you as an outcast or worse--a traitor. Even befriending an Indian back then,  like Ian McCloud & Mr. Snood, will make you an outcast.

It's now revealed that Ralf Whelan, now climbing the power ladder, has a son by the worst of the worst in the Indian class system--a woman that was neither English nor Indian. She was a half breed, just like her and Ralf's son. This alone could collapse everything Ralf's power hungry greed has worked for in India. But did he murder her? Or did he have her murdered by his loyal servant? We don't know yet. But we do know that he made sure Mr. Snood hung for her murder, no matter what Ian McCloud witnessed. And now his sister is having an affair with Afrin, who has finally seen the real Ralf Whelan.

Will Ralf have his son murdered also? Will Alice and Afrin get caught? Why does that woman who owns the club have so much power over Ralf? Will the school teacher take advantage of his horrible wife's absence? Why didn't Alice tell that woman to bugger off or tell her in the beginning that her husband knew where she was? A lot of these questions come from an era that's difficult for us to understand. But I can't wait for Season 2 to try. Also, does anyone know if the whole series is for sale or just Season 1. It doesn't say. It also doesn't say if the DVD will play in the US. If anyone knows, I'd appreciate a comment. TY.",1451865600,,2317,4.442352941176471
6959196,5,B00S52M98G,This is the first season? The ending of the first never ends! Photography is great and country back grounds make you want to go to Myamar. Hope there is a sequel.,1451779200,,162,4.258064516129032
6959197,5,B00S52M98G,"Bought this first season of this series as a gift for a friend who missed it when it was broadcast.  I enjoyed the show and knew that she would too.

Love PBS and support my local public radio and tv, BUT will not bother to order this or even watch another season, if the sound is still so bad. And why?? I need huge speakers for PBS only? I watch all their shows, but this one was the worst for sound.

I did not notice this as much in Downton Abbey, Call the Midwife, Crimson FieldsHome Fires or most other productions from PBS, but the Brits rush their lines way too much and leave off the ends of many of them.  Annoying...not going to bother with this one, as much as I'd love to see both seasons to review. I didn't see the first one.",1449446400,,829,4.16875

6959201,5,B00S52M98G,"Another reviewer complained that the show was dull and boring so the gorgeous (Malasian) scenery had to make up the deficit. It's true that I loved the cinematography and often wondered how the real India, which in my mind is pretty squalid, would have compared. But to say that the story was dull reminds me of those who say that nothing happens in a Jane Austen novel. The story was mostly about people's attitudes and inner issues. I'd say what happened to Mr. ___, the poor Indian plantation owner was pretty dramatic, as was the dropping of the color bar, the return of poor Jaya, the little Adam's story, the betrayal by Dalal's girl friend, and the building tension of the independence movement. This is story-telling for adults. If you miss the car chases and explosions, or the monsters and zombies in other TV shows, you won't like it. I was hoping to find the next season here to purchase so I wouldn't have to wait for PBS to air it.",1449014400,5,945,4.5321637426900585
6959202,5,B00S52M98G,"Haven't bought it yet, but it's in my cart right now because I didn't record it.  Avoided it at first, after Poldark was done.  Did not want to get sucked into another serial and it didn't seem as monumental as Jewel in the Crown.  However, Jewel in the Crown was repeated recently and shows its age; just not as compelling as the first time around.

Started watching Indian Summers first four shows on-line, then couldn't wait for the next episode to air.  True, it's a soap opera, definitely not a documentary of the struggle for Indian independence.  For now, the independence movement is on the periphery.  In the first season, there are at least three love triangles rattling around, jilted women, paternity issues, then a murder, then a monumental injustice, along with many smaller ones.  The only thing missing is an evil twin.  And yeah, there are a lot of loose ends, but that's how serial stories work to keep you interested.

The racism is disturbing, but most likely the way things were/are.  Visiting London in 1980, I witnessed a white Brit pummel and curse a janitor of South Asian ancestry, using their equivalent of the ""N"" word, merely for bumping into him.  Most of the world has not undergone a Civil Rights movement like the US did; even then, there's still work to do.  Watching Indian Summers, realized that a lot of racism stems from Western European colonialism, to keep the races separate and the indigenous peoples oppressed.  Having done a paper on colonialism, when Europeans departed their colonies, they often installed their half-caste offspring in positions of authority.  Still, many ended up warehoused, as in the mission orphanage.

Profound as all that may or may not be, the story of Alice and Aafrin kept me enthralled, along with the hunky male leads.  ;-D  Alice's brother, Ralph, is so good-looking, but so sinister, in a disarming way.  Pretty people can get away with lots.  He's playing chess, while others play checkers, except, like the Queen of Hearts, his chess game is lethal.  So is his sister in Wonderland?  Adorable Aafrin starts out naive, but starts to catch on, whereas simmering Ramu is jaded after years of dealing with the system.  The sad thing is, no matter how much Indians tried to accommodate, emulate and fit in with their British overlords, it did little good.  They were used as pawns and never welcomed as equals.  Whatever injustices Indian Summers highlights, the reality was probably far worse.",1448496000,19,2467,4.872596153846154
6959203,2,B00S52M98G,"I really wanted to like this.  I did watch all of it.  What I found is that it was all so dull.  None of the characters are relatable or likable.  It's truly missing something that I can't put my finger on.  When I watch it, I find myself going to sleep.  The story line is hard to follow.  I'm surprised that it is up for a second season.",1448409600,4,339,3.8970588235294117

6959205,5,B00S52M98G,I love the story and the acting.  It gives a very good picture of the lives of the English and the Indians during the early 1930's.  The difference between the two cultures is clearly shown.  The characters are very interesting - some are noble and some are evil and many are confused.,1448323200,2,285,4.4423076923076925
6959206,2,B00S52M98G,"Except for the fact it wasn't even shot in India!  How sad it that?

There were really no sympathetic characters.  All the English were racists and bigots, all the Indians were... ciphers.  Yes, a lot of the English at that time were horrible, espousing the beliefs on view in this program.  But there were many who were sympathetic to the plight of the Indians, yet there are only two people in this program who seem to tolerate or even like the native people they live among, Alice Whelan and Ian McCloud?  Just doesn't seem realistic.  And Julie Walters character?  Oh, lord, what a harridan!  I couldn't stand hearing her voice after the first episode, the writers had her spewing such hate and venom.  I don't expect something that's all rainbows and sunshine, but the amount of hate and racism and bigotry on display in each and every episode made me nauseous.  It's called striking a balance, showing all sides of a story, something that wasn't on display here.

The worst part was the storyline regarding the missionary's wife, Mrs. Raworth and the sister of the private secretary to the Viceroy, Alice Whelan.  Alice has left her husband back in London, taken their child and run away to India, but to avoid scandal she tells everyone that her husband is dead.  Well, because Mrs. Raworth is a nosy, desperate, social-climbing sneak, she winkles out the truth and holds it over Alice's head, blackmailing her in order to gain entre into the higher echelons of Colonial Indian society.  The question is, why?  Mrs. Raworth is about as threatening as a wet tissue; this is a women who would become confused at an intersection where the street signs have been swapped.  All it would take is for Alice to slap Mrs. Raworth smartly on the face and say to her, Go ahead, tell everyone I've left my husband.  Yes, you might have a brief triumph over me, but it will be brief because I will make sure everyone knows you for the low, backstabbing, sneaky, pathetic blackmailing worm that you are.  And once your true character is revealed, no amount of brown-nosing will ever get you the approval you so desperately crave.  Which means I'll eventually regain my status, but you will never be looked upon at any kind of equal ever again.  For Alice to be continually threatened by Mrs. Raworth was just completely unbelievable.  And ridiculous.  And supremely irritating to watch.

The main problem is whoever wrote this thing was trying to set up a grand mystery with lots of intertwining strands of smaller mysteries that somehow tied into the whole.  Instead what was created was a vague, muddied, and meandering plot that barely allowed the viewer to get a grasp on any one character before being whisked off to another scene and another mystery.  There was no character development or depth, no understanding of the motivation behind their actions, and because of the general sloppiness, no reason was given to care about any of the characters or why they did what they did or wonder how they ended up.  There are moments in the script where we're shown, Hey, look, this character has feelings, is acting a little bit sympathetic even if you normally don't like them!  That means they have depth!  Unfortunately, I don't buy into those moments because they're just more examples of lazy writing.  And I think all of this is because there's no source material to back the program up as with the far superior The Jewel in the Crown.

You've got to give it  a moment to get to know who is who and how they all relate to each other. The backstory of India as a pressure cooker in the pre-Independence days was the most interesting piece of it for me. The stories just seemed contrived to squeeze the most juice out of the period. It didn't feel real. It does make me sit up and say, ""Wow! And people complain about racism in America!""

The scenery is beautiful. The acting by many of the Indian is over the top. It feels like a caricature.

Each character has their many facets exposed in compelling action and dialogue and you shall find yourself invested in just what they may say or do next. The characters are capable of compelling you to cheer for them or to wish them immediate ill fortune.
Many of the actors are top notch, therefore absolutely convincing in their roles. Far from a soap, this story presents depths of colonial India that reflect often the worst of a "" conqueror "" with scant redeeming qualities. Albeit we see the Indian people have agendas of their own, not all attributable to British rule. Both the grandeur and poverty are striking. Great care has been taken to reproduce all the trappings of the era. The lushness of the exteriors is breathtaking. Aside from the Brits and the Indians, there are two Americans characters that lend another aspect. I say. Watch it, you won't be sorry!

It's uncomfortable at times as the racist attitudes practiced then by most of the British are unflinchingly portrayed, however, Indians in turn have a severe caste system of their own.  It wouldn't be believable unless historically correct & I admire the Brits as they are masters at recreating the periods the stories occupy with perfert casting, locations, set decorations, costumes, etc.  The scenery is a feast for the eyes and the colors intense - almost worth watching for that feature alone.

6959227,2,B00S52M98G,"""Indian Summers"" appears to be PBS's attempt to recapture the cultural sweep of the eighties epic, ""The Jewel in the Crown"".  Unfortunately it has neither the historical scope nor the quality of writing that made that original BBC saga such a beloved classic.  Rather, it has all the hallmarks of a pretentious soap opera designed to draw in an audience whose idea of quality drama is limited to serialized emotional turmoil and facile romantic relationships. Masterpiece seems intent on commissioning these contrived soaps set against historical backdrops in the hope that they can broaden their audience demographic to include a more advertiser friendly composite. It's no secret that PBS is quietly, but inevitably, incorporating advertising into it's broadcast schedule and the traditional PBS audience doesn't come close to matching the profile those advertisers favor.

So, if you long for the days of ""Falcon Crest"" and ""Dynasty"" with a little Brit empire nostalgia tossed in you might find this series entertaining.  If not, write Rebecca Eaton at Masterpiece and voice your vigorous disapproval.

Yes, the photography is beautiful - everything is beautiful - too beautiful. The caste system to which the native people were subjected is underplayed except in the opening scenes with the native people in line carrying objects up to the 'summer' residence. The British never colonized well - the problem seemed to be that the natives were not British. India is a painful example of that circumstance.

6959232,5,B00S52M98G,"(For the record, I've watched the complete first season of ""Indian Summers"", it having been broadcasted on New Zealand television in its entirety before airing in America. This review is spoiler free).

It's easy to draw upon&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Downton-Abbey/dp/B0047H7QD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Downton Abbey</a>&nbsp;as a point of comparison to ""Indian Summers"", saying that if you like one you'll enjoy the other. But with the exception of both being period dramas set within a decade of each other, the two shows couldn't be more different. ""Downton Abbey"" is very much a love-letter to the past, while ""Indian Summers"" casts a far more critical eye on the time and place it captures.

It is March 1932 and the sun is about to set on the British Empire, though not before a prolonged period of tension and political turmoil. This period sets the scene for the show's extensive cast of characters, British and Indian alike, as the civil servants of the empire head towards the foot of the Himalayas to escape the heat of summer and enjoy a bit of fun.

With so many characters to keep track of it's a little difficult to grasp the central plot, though I'd suggest keeping your eyes on Ralph Whelan, an ambitious young man with expectations of becoming the next Viceroy of India (and so anxious to maintain his respectable reputation at all costs) and Aafrin Dalal, an earnest young Indian clerk - just as ambitious in his own way - who is increasingly torn between loyalty to his country and the benefits of working for the British Raj.

It's the friction between the personal and the political that drives most of the storylines and character-arcs of the show, and it's to the show's credit that there's plenty of nuance and shades of grey to be found in each of the characters and their situations. No one is completely good or bad, many do the wrong thing for the right reasons or the right thing for the wrong reasons, and you'll almost certainly find that your first impressions of a character have been flipped entirely by the final episode.

""Indian Summers"" starts off very slowly, with such a myriad of plot-lines that it's initially quite dizzying to keep track of it all. But the patient viewer will find that there's a master-plan at work: most of the stories become interwoven as the series goes on, and in hindsight it's clear that everything that occurs had a purpose in the over-arching story.

There's some top-notch acting from the entire cast (especially Julie Walters, if not for simply playing drastically against type) and beautiful choreography in the show's depiction of Simla in the 1930s. Like ""Downton Abbey"" (there's that comparison again) ""Indian Summers"" does an excellent job in portraying a particular time and place, but it's also far more interested in exploring the prejudices, turmoil and cruelty that marked the period.",1440547200,106,2919,5.070833333333334

6959234,5,B00S52M98G,"PROs
 A tale steeped in inter and intrapersonal conflicts (often borne out of political ones) with a twisty plot tying characters together usually on more than one level. This is a narrative of divided loyalties, which leads to some tricky relationships.
 Indian Summers successfully transports you back in time, which is naturally of paramount importance for historical fiction.
 The writers don't pull their punches; the disparaging attitude of the Brits towards the Indians is captured unflinchingly.
 Indian Summers was renewed for a second season, so feel free to get attached to the characters.
 The actors! Jemima West was my primary motivation for ordering the DVD as soon as it became available in the UK, and lucky us: she is Alice, sister to the central British character, Ralph (Henry Lloyd-Hughes). I was pleased to meet Amber Rose Revah as Leena Prasad, who is easily more telegenic than 90% of Hollywood's actresses. Plus some handsome fellas, if that's your thing. In contrast to her placement on the cover art, the role of Julie Walters is not front and center, although her character is a socialite at the center of the web.
 Indian Summers is likelier to make you want to crack open a history book to learn more than is Downton Abbey.

CONs
 It was shot in Malaysia, not India. While I didn't mind this commonplace inconsistency (if I had a buck for every production filmed in a location different from the one it portrayed, I'd be able to retire), this choice apparently has garnered wrath in some quarters.

 I purchased this season on Amazon's UK site, regrettably before I became aware of the Blu-ray release. The picture quality of the UK-released [Region 2] DVD set is disappointing. The US [Region 1] DVD release, which has the PBS ribbon across the top of the cover, is encoded differently than the UK release (it's on 4 discs rather than 3) so *may* have a superior picture. I will probably buy the Blu-ray for a second viewing of the season.

 From the back cover of the DVD:
""The year is 1932, the place is India, and the people are romanticized, politicized, and radicalized. They are drawn together and driven apart by class, race, love and theft, and the world around them is changing. In the small British colony of Simla, placed at the foothills of the Himalayas, the beliefs of the British Empire still remain but the young are hungry for freedom.
Indian Summers tells a sweeping saga; stories of love, secrets, promises made and broken, and tensions that simmer in the hot, feverish days and nights of India -- an India populated by freedom fighters, star-crossed lovers, political spies, artists, orphans, expats, the rich and the poor.""",1438732800,71,2675,4.86784140969163
