8413891,5,B0042QB8VS,"This DVD is a compilation of just a dozen or so of the more than 600 songs Roberto Carlos has written in his career - most with Erasmos Carlos - with female Brasilian singers each doing a song and in conclusion, with Roberto singing ""Emocoes"" alone and a few lines with each of the participants.  I've read so many fans complain they only want to hear him in Spanish.  Well, he sings in five languages, but his music is written for Portugese and I for one am grateful for that.  His music would not be as lovely in English and although I like the one album of his in English (""From Brazil with Love"" found on Amazon) the feeling of his music comes through in spades in Portugese. Thank God he was born in Brasil or we might not have this amazing music to enjoy and love.

The most moving, passionate performer is Hebe Camargo.  She sings ""Voce Nao Sabe"" with a sad, sultry voice that absolutely will knock your socks off.  Of course, Fa Fa de Belem is included in the group, and if you happen to enjoy her, she sings ""Desabafo"".  But not one of the participants in this DVD does as well as Hebe, who is not a singer by occupation.  If you are reading this, you probably know she is a Brasilian TV show hostess and has made it known to all, including her husband, that she adores Roberto Carlos.  She has even asked him to marry her and I suspect if he said yes, she would take him up on it. (So far, he says nothing) So who can blame her?  What's not to love?  This man of music who has written some of the most beautiful love songs ever and has lived his music and shared his heartbreak with the world.  If you want an example of his grief when he lost his wife in 1999, go to ""You Tube Music - Roberto Carlos em recife, Part one (and parts 2 and 3)"" and see what I'm talking about.  He is a performer of the first order and a musician unmatched by any as far as song writing and singing.  He does it all with grace and class, unashamedly with his heart in his hand.  This DVD is just a sample of his music, but the cost alone is worth watching Hebe Camargo.

My only complaint about Roberto is - GET A GOOD HAIRDRESSER!  For the last two years he has had the absolute worst haircut a man could ask for - looking as though he is whacking away at it at home.  He is a handsome man aging beautifully, but spoils it with this short Dutch style bob he has adopted.  If you have seen him in the ""Acustico"" or ""Pra Sempre Ao Vivo No Pacaembu"" DVD's, you've seen how gorgeous he is - but let the hair grow Roberto.  Women notice these things and love you in long hair and feathered bangs.  But - no matter how he looks, that voice is unmatched and beautiful.  It only gets better with time.  He just turned 70 a few days ago and if you shut your eyes and listen to him sing, you wouldn't know if he was 20 or 70 - except his voice has gained an even better timbre.  Some things do get better with time - and Roberto Carlos is a perfect example.",1302998400,2,2938,4.096153846153846
