8226778,1,6304746547,"This film stars the wooden has been lucia Mendez, about how she is sent to an insane asylum by mistake or is she, by the end of the film you don't care because it uses all of the same plot elements used in movies of this type, particularly exploiting the usual insane asylum patients. If you like garbage this movie is for you, otherwise stay away from this feeble trash.",1079740800,3,371,4.314285714285714
8226779,2,6304746547,"This film stars the ever glamourous wooden actress Lucia Mendez. The story is about a reporter who is investigating conditions in a asylum and later learns that she is a patient there, the film is full of the expected twists but with none of the suspense, it's hard to tell the villains from the hero in this mediocre potboiler, the biggest problem is the script which is badly written and also Lucia Mendez who will not allow herself to look like a patient, she always looks like she has her own makeup artist and hair person in the asylum unlike everyone else, she has more makeup on than all the nurses put together making the film look particularly idiotic, unless you are a fan of Lucia Mendez who is in every scene, attempting to act, stay away from this routine film effort.",1039824000,2,781,4.507042253521127

In one word this movie is OUTSTANDING!  Bravo Luca!",1018915200,2,232,4.043478260869565
