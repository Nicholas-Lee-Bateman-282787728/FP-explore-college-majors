1421563,4,B00005BCP5,"The ""Skipped Parts"" are, as you might expect, the little details of sex that are omitted from most stories. Two fourteen-year-olds decide to work out the details themselves, with a little advice from the boy's licentious Mother and a lot of free time together. The film begins with the Mother's rich politician Father exiling her and her illegitimate teenage son from their North Carolina home to Wyoming so they won't be an embarrassment during his political campaign. The story really belongs to the Mother and her new Indian boyfriend. She was about her son's age when she found herself pregnant and dealing with his concerns helps her sort out her own life. It is a lighthearted look at moral bigotry, responsibility, and mixed up relationships. This is a generally delightful, tasteful, and witty comedy compromised by sometimes shallow characterizations and blessed with occasional insights.",997920000,9,897,5.236111111111111
1421564,5,B00005BCP5,"I live in the area which this movie was filmed, Regina, Lumsden, Regina Beach, Saskatchewan Canada.  I can remeber watching the making of this film and hearing the buzz about it on the local TV stations and newspapers.  I have eaten at the Blue Bird Cafe, and still do, the cafe at which Lydia ends up working.  I can say without question that this is one of the best comedies I have seen ever.  It has a touch of strong emotion and a lot of flat out humour.  This is a movie that you can watch anytime, more then once.  I strongly recomend this one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",997228800,6,563,4.314285714285714
1421565,4,B00005BCP5,"This movie was in many ways for me a major disappointment. By itself, it is excellent, with great, oddball performances from its entire cast, and including wonderful cameo appearances by Drew Barrymore as the Dream Girl.  I would have absolutely adored this genuinely bizzare but loving black comedy...if only I had not already read the book.  The book by Tim Sandlin, also called ""Skipped Parts"" is one of the best coming-of-age stories I have ever read. It is funny, crazy, and poignant. The movie didn't capture even a tenth of the charm of the book, and also did not handle the relationship between Maurey and Sam very well. This is a result of trying to tone down what is in essence a story of two young children experimenting with sex.  This made their story seem more like a by-the-books moralistic tale than the authority-be-damned, life-affirming tale that it really is. The characters in the book are understandable; the characters in the movie are understandable...only if you've previously read the book. So my advice is read the book first, and then see the movie. For a fan of the book, it contains enough great moments to make one smile. But I don't think this film will win any new fans who are not already familiar with Sandlin's work.",994982400,14,1252,4.76036866359447
1421566,2,B00005BCP5,"I was so very disappointed in Skipped Parts.  After preordering and waiting so long for it, the movie is not at all what I was hoping for. The sexual exploration between the teenagers could have been handled much differently without some of the crude comments.  What I thought was going to be a very good movie with an interesting storyline, has turned out to be a crude and unappealing story.",994550400,2,393,4.6

1421568,5,B00005BCP5,"Skipped Parts is a sarcastic, amusing, and tender story of preteen wisdom, adult immaturity, and the fine line between. It's 1963 when 13 year old Sam Callahan and his divorced, misbehaving mother, Lydia, are banished to the hick town of GroVont, WY., by Lydia's southern father. Durring their stay in GroVont, Sam practices ""making love"" with Maurey Pierce, a friend from school, so they won't come off stupid as they get older.

It's meant to entertain you for about an hour and a half and give you a feel good time.  The lesson here is that family can be made up of all kinds of characters, and that it all happens under the most unusual of circumstances.  So don't watch this movie expecting some life lesson on morals (unless you take away that everyone was accepting and taking care of each other, which is what society should be about).

1421733,3,B00005BCP5,"The user reviews were what prompted me to view this flick, but, as much as I liked viewing it (or most of it), it just fell flat in the last 20 minutes or so.

The idea is good. It's sort of a fish out of water tale. Jennifer Jason Leigh and her son (played well by Bug Hall) are banished from their North Carolina home by granddad because he's running for office, and having his floozy daughter and bastard grandson around can only hurt his chances of getting elected. He packs them off to Wyoming which is a way different culture. Hall is a 14 year old that is beyond his years and puts up with his mom's....looseness. They both encounter the locals and it's a cultural clash.

Much of this is good. The characters are generally interesting as are the situations. The directing, however, is uneven. It never really rises above hack level and some scenes just don't come off well at all. Many have commented on the fantasy scenes, involving Drew Barrymore at the 50s style pool party, and how good they thought these scenes were. I thought they missed the mark by a wide margin. For my money they lacked authenticity.

I don't want to give anything away but the smaller stories develop during the movie and come to a head when granddad arrives and wants to further display his power. So now you have this small group of outcasts and they need to do something, so the writer banishes them (figuratively) to Hollywood. Tie it up in a pretty bow and blow this pop stand. It just smacked of cheap or lazy or box office.

The acting was very good and most of the camerawork was good enough but I took real exception to some of the soundtrack. Leigh is dating a Native American and in a couple of scenes, when he shows up, they play a song reminiscent of the song ""Apache"" which was popular around that time. The producers wouldn't fork over for the real deal. There were also one or two other songs popular at the time where the producers chose to use cover versions as opposed to the originals and that just makes me want to spit.

This isn't a bad movie. Some of it should be seen. But some of it should not.",1285545600,,2106,4.362244897959184
1421734,3,B00005BCP5,"This was a fairly entertaining film. No real flaws or failures to it. The cast was all-around good, particularly Bug Hall. Brad Renfro and Drew Barrymore were fine, though I can't for the life of me figure out why she was in the movie. Probably just to get butts into seats would be my guess.

The storyline is kept mostly intact from the book, though for the life of me I can't understand why they aged the kids from thirteen to fourteen. What, fourteen-year-old kids having sex and getting pregnant is notably more acceptable than the same thing with thirteen-year-olds?

Still, the movie is largely forgetable. I enjoyed it while watching it, but I have no real drive to see it again. It was entertaining and all, but nothing great.

Some reviewers have a problem with people comparing this movie to the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Skipped-Parts-A-Novel/dp/1573228397/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Skipped Parts: A Novel</a>. Well, I can understand that. They are, after all, two different mediums. But to an extent I think compairison is justified and in this case, the movie falls short. Not by a wide margin, but short nevertheless.",1215216000,,1187,5.370967741935484
1421735,4,B00005BCP5,"Why do people insist on comparing movies with books?  Do they compare music with paintings?  Sculpture with poetry?  Of course not.  And movies should not be compared with books, either.  They are two different mediums, with entirely different modes of personal interaction.  The act of reading a book is completely different from that of watching a movie.  So the minute you read a review that compares a book with a movie, run!  Any such comparision is irrelevant, even if a movie is based on a book (or vice versa).

That said, this is a startling and surprising movie.  It is well-acted, and tells a compelling story.  It is easy to follow, the plot moves along well, and the characters are interesting enough to make you care about them.

So don't worry if you read the book or not, the movie stands on it's own as a worthy film.",1130112000,3,834,4.5608108108108105
1421736,4,B00005BCP5,"Picked this DVD up at the library, believe it or not.  Sounded interesting.  Had NOT read the book, so we were able to take it at face value.
My husband and I found ourselves laughing and getting into the lives of these quirky characters, even though they had very little for us to identify with.  Jennifer Jason Leigh was very good, as were Mischa Barton and Bug Hall.
The best part of this movie was the scenic views of Wyoming countryside.  Okay, I read that it was actually filmed in Canada.  But they did do a good job of presenting the natural side of their area.
Overall, this was a good movie, although not in my Top 20 favorites.  Worth watching, especially if you can check it out for free from the library.
By the way, I know nothing about this, but apparently there is another movie (a prequel, at that) with the same characters from the trilogy by Tim Sandlin:  it is called Floating Away.  Not sure if I would see that one or not...",1083628800,5,946,4.3352272727272725
1421737,1,B00005BCP5,"An accessible story with all the elements of a Great American Novel was somehow transformed into a perverse, worst of the worst ABC Afterschool Specials. If you had not read the book, you would be unable to follow what was happening. Some of the worst directing and editing I have seen in a long time. The original Evil Dead, with all its flaws, is a better put together film than this one. This movie is flat-out painful to watch. You get no justifications whatsoever as to why the characters behave as they do. It all seems so random. Read the book. If you see this movie in a rental store, just move along, please, nothing to see here.",1056240000,3,638,4.415254237288136
1421738,5,B00005BCP5,"Skipped Parts, or Wonder of Sex its UK title, is an absolutely charming gem of a movie.
I was completely engrossed by this coming of age story, that is very rewarding for the viewer, offering some good script, tight direction and wonderful acting.
The unconventional relationship between a liberated mother and her teenage son on one hand and her occasional indian lover on the other, and the unconventional friendship between her son and his 'girlfriend', discovering sex together(which results in a pregnancy), this is all filmed with such care and seeming simplicity, yet without being judgemental. This is why it works so well.
The acting is top class! Jennifer Jason Leigh proving yet again that not only she is one of the best actresses around today, but that she chooses her roles very well. Bug Hall and Mischa Barton (who again does a very good job in TV's Once and Again) are very promising talented actors.
The teenagers attitude towards sex is charmingly naive and at times funny. When Barton's character is staying at sam's place after her pregnancy (since her father did not tolerate what happened), and he offers to sleep outside on the couch, she charmingly suggests to him ina straight faced manner..sleep on the floor in case I need you!.
So Skipped Parts is a very rewarding and sadly underrated film, that well deserves to be in your collection.",1047686400,32,1365,4.887931034482759

1421740,4,B00005BCP5,"I was so excited when I saw this movie available at my local [video store].  Tim Sandlin's coming-of-age novel is one of my favorite books.  It's sweet, self-deprecating, and tactile.  Unfortunately, the movie adaptation is dry, humorless and poorly acted.  I wasn't sure how Hollywood would take such a shocking and sexual book and relate the important scenes (which quite often were sexual) to reality.  You cannot translate this book while playing it safe. I don't think anyone should have tried.
The series of novels, called the ""GroVont Trilogy"" are worth every penny.  You'll laugh despite yourself and be thoroughly entertained.  STAY AWAY from the film.  Jennifer Jason Leigh overacts as usual, and Brad Renfro isn't smart enough to play the lead.  I don't buy it for one second (no pun intended).
I hope this helps - and again Tim Sandlin is a fantastic author - don't use this sorry film to judge his work.  Take the time to read the book - you'll thank me...",1027296000,,969,4.783132530120482
1421741,5,B00005BCP5,This is a wonderful comedy. Bug Hall was especially great in this coming-of-age story about a 14 year old boy and girl.,1021593600,2,119,4.454545454545454
1421742,5,B00005BCP5,"This is a great coming of age story that I have watched twice in one week since I decided to buy it on a whim.  The story of Lydia and Sam and their exile to Wyoming, their unconventional relationship as mother and son is unforgettable.  Lydia isn't a woman who is very good at being a mother considering she drinks quite heavily and goes home with men at the bar.  When Sam meets a girl named Maurey, they both decide to start trying to figure out what sex is like.  Lydia tells them how to have sex and from that point on, this movie is a strange, oddball journey.  This film shows what can happen to kids who grow up too fast, but it does this in a way that is heart-warming and different than most films.
I especially liked Michael Greyeyes' character, Hank Elkrunner.  He plays a good guy who falls for Lydia only to have to deal with her wild ways.  All of the actors in this film did a great job.  And surprisingly, this film has a happy ending.
All in all, a great, funny film that is sure to stay with you long after its over.  Hilarious",1016668800,24,1046,4.164179104477612
1421743,5,B00005BCP5,This one is worth watching purely for the amazingly talented and incredibly handsome Michael Greyeyes. Without Michael the movie would be absolutely nothing and not at all worth watching. Five stars for Michael alone!!!,998611200,,219,5.470588235294118
