8756194,5,B01DKTCAQO,"Billie is ""boxed"" in by Rod who flits about like a giddy butterfly just let out of its box. A glittery romp, this 20s flick bears all the scars of that bygone era...outraged millionaires...breathless vamps...baffled Beefhearts wearing their hearts on their sleeves like so many Galahads lacking a steed. Billie flies, Rod ducks and then gets doused...by this shameless Lindbergh wannabe.  No, Ma'm, they sure don't make 'em like this anymore...",1491004800,,444,5.253521126760563
8756195,4,B01DKTCAQO,The film itself isn't much but Billie Dove is so mesmerizingly beautiful that her presence alone makes the film worth watching.,1468972800,3,127,5.095238095238095
8756196,3,B01DKTCAQO,"Not burned on M-DISC.  Instead, they used old-fashioned, dye type media.  Great movie however,

I understand that with obscure movies, sales levels may not justify pressing a disk. But I would've happily paid 2 dollars more to have the movie burned on 1000 year life, M-DISC.

Great movie. Glad to have this in my collection.",1463270400,6,325,4.8545454545454545
