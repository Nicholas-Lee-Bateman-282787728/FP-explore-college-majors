8099942,1,B000COZRFC,"If you are a drooling serial killer or you just enjoy torturing animals for a hobby, you'll probably like this film.

It was all the rage in the '80s, which is when I saw it. I had no desire to see it a second time around.

I still recall the morons who were horrifically bopping a live monkey in the head with small hammers, as a restaurant owner had the poor creature's head trapped in a hole in the center of a dining table, as the monkey screamed in terror until it eventually died. Then the skull was opened and the diners ate the brains.

I gave this film one star only because it's not an option to give it a ZERO. This is a sick and depraved piece of film footage.",1202169600,2,672,4.075757575757576
