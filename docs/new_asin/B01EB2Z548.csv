8758260,3,B01EB2Z548,"New pieces for me, excellent dancing, interesting choreography, but music did not have enough character particularly in a rather well known work with an opera being the outstanding realization It was a pleasant bunch of sounds but did not carry the presentation forward",1475625600,,269,5.27906976744186
8758261,5,B01EB2Z548,"This is among John Neumeier's finest ballets. It is a faithful telling of Pushkin's novel, Eugene Onegin. There is a lot of great dancing in this. The dancing style is basically very classical with plenty of modernisms thrown in. The women mostly dance on pointe; there is even a long dance sequence where Tatiana dances with a pointe shoe on one foot and the other foot bare. The music is solidly neo-romantic and very well done by Lera Auerbach. The ballet is in two acts with a prologue and ten scenes. The dancing consists of some short episodic segments with some longer solos, pas de deux, and ensemble variations. I like to see a lot of dancing in ballets and I was not disappointed with this. This is a very modern ballet and before buying it, you should check out some of the trailers and other clips that are available online to see if this is for you. This is a wonderfully choreographed, staged, composed, danced, and acted ballet and if you like modern ballets you should love this.",1469923200,4,995,4.564245810055866
8758262,2,B01EB2Z548,"It tried too hard to be drama with the dance relegated to second place.  Act 2 was better from a dance perspective than Act 1, but not enough to save this work for me.  Neumeier says it is not Cranko's Onegin -- sad to say that's very true.  I have very fond memories of Onegin and wish it would be put out on DVD.  There is nothing wrong with making the focus Tatiana.  But the dancing just did not make it for me.  Very disappointing.",1469577600,6,436,4.070588235294117
