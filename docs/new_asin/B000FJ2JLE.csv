8123531,5,B000FJ2JLE,Great dvd.  My 2 yr old granddaughter loves it!!  Recommend to any daycare.  Kids pick up on songs and dance and clap with it.,1395619200,,126,4.166666666666667
8123532,4,B000FJ2JLE,"Lot's of songs. Some are a bit of a strange fit - purple people eater, a song about the waltz, do your ears hang low with the biggles.....and a very long commercial at the end. All that being said, my son loves it. ""See you later alligator"" is his favorite because of the catchy tune and the good video footage of alligators. They should have a choice to jump past the commentary and into the songs but they don't......it's a bit long.",1325289600,,435,4.317073170731708
