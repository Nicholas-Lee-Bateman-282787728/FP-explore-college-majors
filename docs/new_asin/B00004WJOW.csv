1365814,5,B00004WJOW,"I first heard about this when I visited the Imperial War Museum in London earlier this year.  There I was able to meet several of the people  interviewed in the book and film.  There was a huge display about the  ""Finest Hour"" because this is the 60th anniversary of the Battle  of Britain and because the survivors are now getting very old and are  ""going West..."" It was time to truly put on a grand finale!
And  then BBC put together this film tribute.  PBS has shown it here in the  United States and there is a book also. Putting it simply:  this is  OUTSTANDING!  You will be gripped from the very start and simply won't want  to leave your video.  This is what you seldom see on television but when  you do...it leaves a lasting impression.
The film uses  survivors...""ordinary blokes"" as one will call himself, to tell  the story of young men and women, thrust into a war that they themselves  thought might be the end of the world as they knew it.  Young men in their  late teens, just out of flying training, suddenly thrust into an air battle  that would decide the fate of their country!  Young children sent overseas  to a faraway land because of the fear they would be killed in the bombing  of the cities...
And you learn of the horror, the fears, the pain, as  well as the joy, exultation, and jubilation.  You get it all in this  documentary.  All Americans should see this because unless you are British,  or have spent a lot of time there, you really don't know how huge the  impact of this time was on the English people.
Get this film!  You will  NOT be dissappointed!",968198400,56,1589,4.391003460207613

7925468,5,B00004WJOW,"An outstanding account of one of the critical periods prior to the U.S. entry into into WW II. The ""true grit"" of Prime Minister Winston Churchill, the British people, and particularly the pilots of the RAF is shown over and over again in terrific actual footage of the Battle of Britain. A 'must have'  for any WW II buff.",1259539200,8,323,4.47457627118644

7925470,1,B00004WJOW,"A wonderful account of when England stood alone in 1940.  The producers sought out people who had personal and interesting stories to tell during that time.  One of those persons told of her harrowing journey together with 90-odd children, whose ship was torpedoed on its way to Canada.  She was one of few survivors. An important piece of history extraordinarily told by such courageous people.",1221955200,4,395,5.046153846153846
7925471,3,B00004WJOW,"""...Churchill was facing the collapse of his cabinet and the loss of most of his army"" (then stranded in Dunkirk). ""Over 200 British & French warships were soon involved in the rescue mission along with hundreds of smaller civilian craft."" ""The evacuation had gone better than anyone had dared to hope. Almost all the stranded British soldiers were rescued along with 80,000 French troops."" Churchill---the 'man of the hour' in the drama of Britain's Finest Hour---had been Prime Minister for less than 3 weeks by this time. The documentary posits that Churchill's support was not great at this time; that Washington was ""concerned about Winston Churchill's reputation as a heavy drinker,"" and that ""Churchill's enemies in London shared the same anxiety. They believed that the PM's war policy was driven by bravado."" Such is the substance of the first hour plus of this participant interview documentary, entitled ""Finest Hour: The Battle of Britain,"" that, oddly enough, concerns not just the air war over Britain---which is more commonly referred to as the Battle of Britain---but the entire war effort. Consequently Churchill isn't quoted as saying that ""The Battle of Britain is about to begin,"" and ""upon this battle depends the survival of Christian civilization"" until the end of Part One of this program; once 107 minutes have elapsed herein. But before much praise is given to Churchill's travels around the country and his speeches the producers, early in Part Two, make the point that ""not everyone was inspired by Churchill's visits or by his oratory."" We then get interviews of guys caught behind enemy lines seemingly just trying to save their own skins, the impressions of shipwrecked civilians, and critical remarks from former Navy seamen. These interviewees are often shown walking the environs where they worked many years back or walking along the geographic locale they are speaking about; be it beaches, abandoned airfields, strategic cliffs, or what have you. Then the producers ultimately conclude this examination of a massively successful endeavor by a determined people by explaining that ""the British people rallied behind a maverick leader whose policy of total defense had at first appeared suicidal"" But we get little by way of how this was accomplished; why Brits rallied under Churchill or details how individuals rose to the challenges facing them. That, after all, ought be the substance of a telling of the story of Britain's Finest Hour. PS: See my Amazon list on what to see/read to viscerally experience WW2.

7925473,3,B00004WJOW,I had read the book which prompted me to get the DVD. I enjoyed the book far more than the video . The book captured the dog fighting between the Luftwaffe and the RAF as if one was actually in the airplane. The DVD dealt with the Battle of Britain in the air in not so detailed a fashion and the writing did not come across nearly as well as the book. My wife (who had also read the book) and I were somewhat disappointed with the DVD.,1128643200,2,436,3.965909090909091
7925474,5,B00004WJOW,"Like Ken Burns' haunting ""The Civil War"", ""Finest Hour: The Battle of Britain"" (not to be confused with many other ""Finest Hour"" productions) is the last word in documentary magic. Arguably no other society since the Spartans has shown the raw, hanging-by-the-fingernails courage that the British summoned to hold out against the Nazi war machine. Narrated by the great Will Lyman, this documentary's strength lies in the personal accounts of profoundly British individuals who survived staggering hardship, and went on to enjoy their four o'clock tea; and in its standard-raising, professional quality.
Like all great documentaries, this production leaves the viewer with a profound sense of history as an aggregate of individual acts of courage, eccentricity, and occasionally just plain opportunism - all of which lead to Churchill's  ""broad, sunlit uplands"" of the mind and spirit.",1090281600,15,885,5.507352941176471
