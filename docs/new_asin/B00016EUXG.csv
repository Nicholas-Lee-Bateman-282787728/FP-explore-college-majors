8007208,4,B00016EUXG,"Although at first glance I was disappointed that the dancing is not strictly belly dancing, this is a great DVD especially for those interested in belly dance history.  We can see how the U.S. has influenced the interpretation of belly dancing in the mid-east and we see why Samia had great appeal in North America.  I've especially enjoyed Samia's arm movements and other subtle moves that will surely help me in improving my dance.",1120348800,3,433,4.837837837837838
