8512015,1,B0077PTWGE,Keep in mind that this was published and released May 2012. Snowden blew the whistle on the NSA violating FISA restrictions to collect meta-data on American Citizens. So it is amusing to hear officials from the NSA in this documentary assuring everyone that there is direct and massive oversight from ALL three branches of government. That turned out to be an inaccurate statement as well.,1496707200,,389,5.0
8512016,5,B0077PTWGE,Recommended. I use it in a Intelligence Analysis Class,1458604800,,54,5.111111111111111
8512017,1,B0077PTWGE,not a good documentary!!,1429315200,,24,5.25
8512018,5,B0077PTWGE,Very interesting look into the NSA,1424131200,,34,4.833333333333333
8512019,3,B0077PTWGE,This is a so what DVD. Nothing surprising to those aware of the intelligence community,1414713600,,86,4.8
8512020,4,B0077PTWGE,As informative as it gets. A very good showing of why 'No Such Agency' is important to the descision making process.,1404086400,,116,4.571428571428571
8512021,5,B0077PTWGE,This DVD is make 1 yrs before Edward Snowden was leave for Russia. So is Bradley Manning. They are both heroes.,1376524800,,111,4.333333333333333
8512022,4,B0077PTWGE,Good video. Very eye opening regarding how much we are being monitored on our computers. I don't think there is anything we can do on a computer that can't be monitored by the NSA unless you unplug your Ethernet cable and turn off your wifi so you have no connection to the internet. Must be a lot of math involved since they evidently employ more mathematicians than anybody else on Earth.,1367107200,,390,4.507042253521127
8512023,5,B0077PTWGE,"The NSA, National Security Agency, is one of the most important agencies to come out of 9/11.  It is a huge agency and has hired 1000's of America's best mathmeticians, analysts, code-breakers, and out-of-the-box thinkers.  The narrator of the video frequently tantalizes with amazing secrets to be learned from the video, but of course, that would just be stupid.  Some things need to be secret in the desperate work to keep our country safe. (I have two daughters working there, who make brief, non-speaking appearances.)",1346198400,3,523,5.129411764705883
8512024,5,B0077PTWGE,Supurb video. I highly recommend it. It is current and shows a lot of the activities going on with hich I am familiar. Great education video to show what positive activities our tax money is put to to protect the U.S.A.,1337126400,3,219,4.365853658536586
