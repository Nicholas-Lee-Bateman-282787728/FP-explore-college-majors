There obviously were no entomologists on the selection panel for the Peabody Award. A sensationalist introduction raises concern of extinction of honey bees. Profiles several cases of the disappearance of the honey bee although nowhere in the program is there a definition that this is about the European honey bee and that there are other bees and non-hymenopteran pollinators that are not involved in colony collapse disorder (CCD). Therefore, every generalization about the loss of this honey bee being the cost of shutting down all pollination (which would affect one third of the North American food supply) is an overreach, a distinction that is never made but which is important.

This should not detract from the seriousness of the situation.  Initial sensational phrases of this research being a ""race against time"" combined with the final frame that states that if the decline continues, there would be no bees by 2035, continues the sensationalist flavor of this video.

Good perspective of Maine blueberry farms pollinated by bees from Pennsylvania via portable bee operations that charge $90 per hive. A nice animated outline diagram of the honeybee briefly summarizes the anatomy and is useful for teachers. The beginning of CCD is chronicled and early theories of cell phone radiation and varroa mites as causes are dismissed.

Brief descriptions of the queen, workers and drones, and the 30-day life cycle are however marred by several factual errors.  Workers do not ""go to work from the moment they hatch"" but remain larvae fed by workers. If they meant from the time they pupated, then that is another term and still in error.  A second error is made by the script writers when describing the bee communication as giving instructions to ""turn right at 50 feet.""  Bee ""instructions"" are for distance and direction--no intermediate turns.  Usually Nature uses scientists as script reviewers but apparently not in this case.

The CCD loss has been great enough that the U.S. has to import bees from Australia. Interviewed scientists shift back-and-forth between Pennsylvania State University and Columbia University disease labs. They search for pathogens using DNA and find plentiful agents. Possible causes include 1) suppressed immune system, 2) nutritional stress, and 3) pesticides.

Moving to France, scientists research city bees for the effect of neonicotinoids used on sunflowers but find the cause to be multi-factor. Penn State runs pesticide tests but finds CCD occurs where no pesticides are used. France uses bees for the huge fields of lavender and shows harvesting of honeycomb honey. Spain has CCD in 2006 and suggests malnutrition from monoculture. A microsporidian disease agent Nosema is found in all hives, infected and healthy, and may be a cause only if it is a compounded factor. [Recent research indicates Nosema may be a major factor.]  England officially has no CCD but some of their beekeepers dispute this.

China exports 90 percent of the world's royal jelly; some is used in the U.S. for developing queens from larvae. Can humans replace bees by pollinating a crop by hand? Fabulous footage from south Sichuan Province in China shows human pollination and individual wrapping of the resultant pears. This was due to 1980s extirpation of bees from pesticides.  In the U.S., this labor cost would exceed $90 million per year. Meanwhile, the Columbia University lab isolates IAPV (Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus).  A third and final error (a large number for Nature) comes from one  interviewed researcher who indicates that maybe crossbreeding with an ""Africanized"" honey bee would produce a resistant hybrid. But that bee should be called ""African"" and not ""Africanized"" insofar as that strain at our southern border shows no hybridization.

An extra feature: ""Why Bees Are Important"" shows the same entomologists answering that question in the first four minutes and then addressing ""what can you do to help"" in a second four minutes: polyculture, accept less than perfect fruit, reduce pesticide use.",1326240000,10,4105,5.233231707317073

3173679,4,B0017M9ZJM,"I'm used to being duped and buying things that don't have all they advertise.  The reverse has happened here.  This is not one documentary; there are two here.  The bees aren't the first one: a work on parrots in Australia is.  Why would one under-advertise their product?  Further, I think humans like birds better than bees.  I think we Americans like happy stories; the doc on birds has that; it's the doc on bees that is sad and depressing.

Even though the doc on birds focused solely on Australia, the work used an American narrator.  In a way, that was a good thing, as we Americans see Aussie accents as exotic and might be lured away from listening to the narrator's message over his style.  I had also heard that Western-born animals are devastating Australia and its marsupials.  Supposedly cats have a field day on platypuses, koalas, etc.  Here, they never state that parrots are harmed by animals foreign to their ecosystem.  Also, I'm used to hearing of humans destroying animal environments.  The overpopulation of humans is playing a role in pandas and Sumatran rhinos dying off.  Here however, when Aussies bring up water deep in the ground or spread veggies to feed the livestock, the parrots take advantage of it.  For the first time ever, a serious narrator in a documentary used the word ""poo,"" rather than ""excement.""  They show a bird that raises its chicks in a termite hill.  Surprisingly, the bird don't eat the termite larvae inside.  I would think all birds love all stages of insects just as much as I love the McRib!

Many people brush off environmentalism.  As far as they are concerned, they have sunscreen to lather on and don't fear the deteriorating ozone.  They don't live in those islands that will disappear as the polar caps melt.  They don't care about pandas and manatees anyway.  However, this work says we'd all be eating only gruel if it weren't for the pollinating efforts of bees.  Folk who like mysteries period will enjoy this work as it investigates numerous theories.  I would say most viewers like easy answers and simple solutions; this doc should be lauded as it repeats that there is no one cause to the dying off of bees.  I agree with theorist Carl Jung who posited that humans have always hated insects, rodents, and dying bodies.  Along those lines, I want to save the bees, but looking at them close up was not pleasant.  Remember in ""The Fly"" when Goldblum's character first sees the fly in his genes close up?  Yuck!  Those head-turning moments happen here.  One reason folk like James Bond movies is that they tend to have international locations.  The death of bees happens in the US, France, Spain, and all over.  They showed how the Chinese are trying to pollinate trees on their own, but admit it's too costly and cannot be a permanent solution.  Because the subject is so depressing, the doc makers had the foresight to ad a feature on what viewers can do to help.

Taking a step back, maybe viewers like experiencing joy and pain consecutively.  The way this work lifts one up and then pushes one off a cliff may be a satisfying experience to some viewers.  The more I type, the more I realize how much I truly enjoyed this DVD.",1252713600,11,3197,4.65474060822898
