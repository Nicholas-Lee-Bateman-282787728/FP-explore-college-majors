8125474,5,B000FQ4JGA,"Private is a rather underrated film about a Palestinian family whose home is suddenly taken over and occupied by Israeli troops. The plot moves along well and it certainly held my interest. The acting by all is superb and very convincing; this makes the film something I won't forget anytime soon. The choreography and cinematography reflect great forethought and the musical score enhances the film.

When the story begins, we see how a Palestinian family lives in a house in between a Palestinian village and some Israeli settlements. They go through their days with the usual concerns of a family: the parents pushing the children to study hard and learn in school; the housewife who sticks by her husband and the husband, the patriarch of the family, working on his computer to make money so they can pay their bills. In the background they hear reminders of the Palestinian and Israeli conflict mostly at night with helicopters flying over the house and more.

However, their relatively stable existence in thrown into chaos when Israeli troops under Commander Ofer (Lior Miller) barge in violently in the middle of the night and occupy their house; Ofer tells patriarch Mohammed (Mohammed Bakri) that the upstairs will be where the soldiers stay and that they are not allowed there under any circumstances; that the Palestinian family members can only enter the middle of the house with the permission of the Israeli troops and the entire family must be locked in the living room for the night. This enrages Mohammed and his family; but Mohammed remembers his nonviolent principles and refuses to fight the Israeli troops with violence. Mohammed feels that just by staying he and his family are indeed fighting the occupiers of the house; this leads him into direct and angry confrontations with his wife Samiah (Areen Omari); his eldest daughter Mariam (Hend Ayoub) and his oldest son Jamal (Marco Alsaying). The occupation also takes its toll on Mohammed and Samiah's three other children.

 I've already left out some of the plot in order to avoid spoilers; and I won't tell you too much more so you can watch this film for yourself and feel its full impact. I do agree with the reviewer who writes that Hollywood would probably be uneasy at best to release a film so clearly highlighting the plight of the Palestinians. Equally important, however, it's interesting to see what happens when Mariam discovers a human side to the Israelis while she hides in an upstairs closet to spy on them.

I should also add that the conflict between the Israeli troops occupying the Palestinian's home clearly symbolizes the trouble that comes with Israelis occupying land that Palestinians want to claim as their own.

The DVD comes with brief information about director Saverio Costanzo. I would have liked a ""making of"" featurette or an interview with some of the actors in this film; but it's all so well done that this becomes a minor quibble.

Private is a memorable, well done motion picture that does what few films have--show the effects of the Palestinian/Israeli conflict primarily from a Palestinian point of view. The film accomplishes its goal well! I recommend this film for people who appreciate dark foreign dramas based on real life struggles and foreign film in general.",1355356800,,3284,4.96
8125475,3,B000FQ4JGA,"This was pretty good for as low budget as it was. I was a little miffed by the lack of storyline. A group of IDF soldiers come into a house, requistion it and the family lives downstairs. They stretched that into about 90 minutes. I wish they could have developed the characters more. I was also somewhat let down by the fact that there was no mention of Palestinian terrorists and the role they play in making the lives of Palestinian miserable. If it wasn't for terrorism, the Israeli army wouldn't need to have a presence in the West Bank. All said and done it wasn't horrible but it wasn't fantastic either.",1303776000,,611,4.464285714285714
8125476,5,B000FQ4JGA,"This powerful little allegory has all the intensity of an in-your-face thriller shot with the immediacy of documentary-style camerawork and editing. Quite simply, a Palestinian family has their house taken over by a small platoon of Israeli soldiers. Confined to one room every night, they each react in different ways to what is an unquestionable outrage. The father refuses to yield, when abandoning the house would seem the only way to save his family and himself, especially when he is threatened by the commanding officer who puts a gun to his head. While his daughter slowly comes around to her father's belief that the soldiers are no less human than themselves, afraid and vulnerable, his son is pulled in a very different direction - retaliation. At the end, we are left with the harrowing conclusion that one cancels out the other, and there may never be an end.

Italian filmmaker Saverio Costanzo is masterful not only in keeping the adrenalin flowing but in preserving the credibility of the film's story at both allegorical and naturalistic levels. The family stands for Occupied Palestine, and the political statement made is crystal clear. Meanwhile, the actual situation is straight out of the pages of  Israeli journalist Amira Haas' reportage from the West Bank. The achievement in part is due to the performances of the actors, whose characters are fully realized. Wait for the scene on the stairs between the oldest daughter and the youngest son. If only movies could change the world.",1250899200,,1506,5.044176706827309
8125477,4,B000FQ4JGA,"This film shows an unusual ""other side"" of the Middle East problem. The media is kind of controlled and we never get to see the palestinian casualties and drama. Some unaware people even think they don't have hearts,families, children and pain. The film also suggests that when you live a desperate life and have no choices sometimes you look for desperate actions.",1228348800,,365,4.903225806451613
8125478,1,B000FQ4JGA,"What would one say about a film portraying a concentration camp during the holocaust where the key questions are those posed to the inmates; how are they going to resist, will they collaborate, and so on.  What if the SS guard in the watchtower during the day is portrayed as ""human"", and playing around with his mates after work? And a film where no hard questions are put to the _oppressor_. Well, Costanzo's film is just that in the Palestinian context.  It is film that delves primarily on trite clichs, sentimental mush about the victims, and also about portraying the soldiers as ""human"" and also victims.

The film was shot in Italy with a cast of Palestinian and Israeli actors. All the Israelis are active members of the Israeli armed forces, and the lead Israeli character is a member of the infamous Golani brigade -- known for its violent actions in the occupied territories. During the initial stages of the filming, a competition arose between the Palestinians and Israelis to outbid one another in portraying their ""humanity"". Of course, following this formula it is not possible to depict the Palestinian condition, and the portrayal of Israeli actions is inherently biased -- the soldiers are on their best behavior, and don't show the brutal face seen by most Palestinians.

The film finds the silliest means imaginable to show the Israeli ""human face"". The teenage daughter seeks to steal a weapon and possibly use it against the soldiers, but is thwarted at the last moment by an intervention of another soldier. She manages to hide in a closet and gets a glimpse of her tormentors. After this close brush, she repeatedly hides in the closet to get further insights into the soldiers' lives, and determines that there is a ""human side"" to them -- humanity viewed through a peephole. From this insight, she also changes her attitude towards the occupier and adopts her father's steadfast resistance. Costanzo uses the glimpses of ""humanity"" seen covertly through the closet's doors to demonstrate that the Israeli soldiers are ""human"". This framework is patently absurd because the issue is not the warm relationship among the soldiers or the fact that they get excited about football; the issue is their behavior towards the Palestinians and here there isn't much ""humane"" behavior in evidence. Similarly, the many actual cases of dispossession are not marked by ""humane"" behavior; in reality, brutality is the norm. The transformation of the daughter's assessment of the soldiers doesn't come about because of a change in their behavior towards the family, but only because she finds that between each other the soldiers are actually quite ordinary! Nothing in the reaction of the Israeli soldiers could explain the change of the two teenage children from willingness to countenance violence to one where they decide to pursue a non-violent steadfast resistance.

One must also wonder why the director seeks to ""humanize"" the oppressor. It would be difficult to imagine the need to ""humanize"", say, the armed settlers who make Palestinian lives miserable. Those perpetrating brutal and sordid acts don't deserve to be ""humanized"" -- what is important is to highlight the oppression, not the nature of the oppressors.
Neither does the father have much to show for his steadfastness. His small acts of resistance bear no fruit, nor do they change the Israeli behavior. On the contrary, for the flimsiest of reasons the Israeli commander threatens to execute him in front of his family -- oh yes, one of the soldiers briefly raises an objection that is quickly dismissed by the officer. There is no reason in this film to think that the Israelis have changed their attitude, let alone decide to exit the house and observe common decency.

Some days after the threatened execution, Bakri and the officer sit at the kitchen table, and maybe this was meant to show a glimpse of mutual appreciation. The officer asks Bakri why he stays in his house -- which yields the profound reply ""because this is my house""! The fact that the Israeli soldier asks the question at all is already problematic because in reality it is a common question asked by soldiers of those whom they seek to dispossess. The dialogue with this soldier isn't one where the oppressor tries to understand the oppressed. Bakri's means of resistance hasn't penetrated through to the human core of his tormentors.

The portrayal of the steadfast resistance, or sumud, is also flawed. In one scene, the youngest daughter desperately seeks to go to the bathroom and acceding to her plight would mean her father banging on the door, demanding that the soldiers allow his daughter to go to the bathroom. Instead of banging on the door and eliciting a likely confrontation, Bakri urges his daughter to resist her need to go! NB: steadfast non-violent resistance doesn't mean that one should improve one's bladder control. Non-violent resistance is more than just clinging on to a patch of land; in Gandhi's approach, it entails confronting the oppressor. In this film, non-violent resistance is represented as clinging on to the house, and the father seeks to keep confrontations with the soldiers to a minimum. Again, this is absurd.

*Missing the key point*

The film dwells on the intra-family tensions in dealing with the occupation of their house and focuses on the friction arising from the characters' differing views on how to confront the soldiers. The film's focus is how to resist, with a strong suggestion that the resistance should be non-violent. However, the director fails to ask the key question and never really explains _why_ the soldiers invaded this house or why there are any tensions between Israelis and Palestinians. The means whereby Palestinians resist is an issue that has to be debated in their society and by the people affected by the occupation and dispossession. Whatever the outcome of that debate, i.e., a non-violent or violent way to resist, should not affect an outsider's solidarity with a people who have been subjected to mass injustice. Now, if one were to query why this dreadful situation persists, then this would raise questions for the oppressor and those outside the region concerned with the injustices being perpetrated. Unfortunately, the film stresses the issues centering on the Palestinian society, and not those that impinge on Israelis or outsiders. In essence, the film fails on many levels.

*Illegitimate questions*

Many soldiers and settlers in the occupied territories are making the life of the Palestinians miserable, and the questions that come to mind are those one would want to pose to the soldiers -- the oppressors. How do they justify the manifest barbarity against the Palestinians? When they invade houses, why do they opt for this drawn out torture and misery? Why do they feel that they are justified in stealing Palestinian homes? And why does the Israeli government connive with the settlers? These are the key questions. Ultimately, these questions need to be addressed by anyone concerned with confronting injustice.

It would have been rather tactless for anyone to have asked the Palestinian family portrayed in the film how they planned to resist the soldiers' attempt to steal their home. If they chose to resist by violent means this would have given the Israelis the ultimate pretext to dispossess and banish the family. If they chose steadfast resistance, they would have to endure the brutality, humiliation and intimidation. It is facile for liberals to pontificate about non-violent resistance, but ultimately any option has stark consequences. It is also a sign of illegitimate solidarity for one to put the onus on the Palestinians and the way they confront the armed settlers or the soldiers. The key moral questions need to be posed to the oppressors, not the oppressed. Alas, this film deals exclusively with questions posed to the oppressed, and this comes after decades of oppression and dispossession.",1210982400,,7974,5.069359756097561
8125479,3,B000FQ4JGA,"Not many American audiences will be familiar with Saverio Costanzo's Golden Leopard Award winning Private. This is because Hollywood would not dare to approach the Palestine-Israeli issue from a decidely Arab prospective. The second reason is that this is intense filmmaking that challenges our ideas on the Middle Eastern situation.

Mohammad(Mohammad Bakri) is a middle aged father of five living with his wife Samiah (Areen Omari) in a lage house midway between a Palestinian village and an Israeli settlement. Sice the home can be viewed as a strategic lookout point it is forceably occupied by Israeli soldiers led by Commander Ofer (Lior Miller). The family is given the choice either to leave the house or to occupy a few downstairs rooms in the daytime and be locked in the living room at night. The family, under pain of punishment, is told that they must not venture into the upstairs bedrooms where the soldiers are staying.

What follows the occupation can be seen as a metaphor for the entire Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Mohammad is faced with the choice to leave and thus give up his principles to to maintain his nonviolent protest come what may. His oldest daughter,Mariam (Hend Ayoub), wants to stay and fight but at great danger to herself tries desperately to humanize her captors. The family's oldeat son, Jamal (Marco Alsaving)chooses a far more violent approach. He sides with Palestinian freedom fighters and imagines himself to be one. What we have here is more than the story of a people. Rather it is the very real story of a family falling apart in the face of adversity.

The film was shot in DV by Luigi Martinucci and the picture has a murky verite feel especially in the nighttime scenes. The viewer becomes almost a voyeur to the action and as the movie moves along we feel claustrophobic and trapped like the family.

This is a difficult film to watch because of the subject matter but it should be seen by a wider audience than it has. The all region disc by Typecast features none of the special features that are available on the Region 2 disc that has been widely reviewed in the media. The Dolby 2.0 sountrack is servicable and the disc contains a trailer and simple production notes.

Well worth the effort if you can find it.",1205280000,,2267,4.802564102564102
8125480,5,B000FQ4JGA,"Easily the best film I have seen on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Private expresses the intense antagonisms of the political conflict through an extremely particular interaction between a Palestinian family and an Israeli military unit. Though the political and the personal are woven into each and every struggle of the film, characters are accorded their humanity in personal terms, avoiding the common descent into generalization of many films on this conflict.

The greatest strength of this film is that, though the conflict is central to every piece of the story, it is expressed primarily in its pervasive influence on the individual: the brutality of power, racism, the struggle to maintain purpose amidst uncertainty and fear. In doing this, the film refuses to draw clear lines. There are few heroes, and their moments of redemeption are not grand but small, reluctant, even accidental.

This film has not received the publicity of other recent films and documentaries on the conflict. I fear this is partly because it does not provide that warm, fuzzy feeling U.S. audiences seek. But, probably more important, the film is geared for an audience that is already familiar with the conflict. There is little explanation of who the characters are or the circumstances in which the plot occurs. These are immediately obvious to those familiar with the conflict, but may lead to confusion on the part of many viewers.

Still, if it is a window into the intimate struggles of the conflict you seek, I can not recommend any better film. While one can not help but draw broader implications, it is very clear that the characters are not meant to be merely lowest-common-denominator representatives of their respective societies. Each tells their own tale, and the parts do not add up to the whole story of the conflict, but the pieces that are presented are thoroughly and sincerely told.",1178928000,,1895,5.106451612903226
