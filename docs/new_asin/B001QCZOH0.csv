8335351,4,B001QCZOH0,"For those who like both obscure action-based cult films and John Saxon (like I do), this is a must-see in my book. Saxon plays a cocky, headstrong, career bank-robber extraordinaire named Mariano Beltrand. His method is far more unconventional than most in his craft, who usually go up directly to a bank-teller to demand his loot, he goes directly to the source via the accounting offices to get what he wants and gets it in ways one would have never thought to be possible. And even though he and his cronies are always several steps ahead of the cops tracking them down, he takes delight in taunting them for their lack of their due diligence.
In the meantime, the police commissioner played by Frank Rabal, is also eagerly determined to catch Mariano and his gang, even if it kills him. He's been after this man for several years and still hasn't caught up with him yet...but he's still hell bent and bound and determined to catch him no matter what the cost, even if it's at the price for losing his partner in a shootout with Mariano and his gang. There is a scene featuring a surgical procedure of bullets being extracted from his body, so for those who are prone to be squeamish, be duly warned.
Aside from being pursued by the cops, Mariano has another reason to worry. His female accomplice played by Bianca Estrada, is pregnant with their child. When he tells her he needs to return back to Spain to take care of some unfinished business after losing one of his brothers, she begs him not to go back, fearing he might be captured or killed. She says 'we women are stupid, but we're also practical', justifying her rationale for being with a bad boy like Mariano Beltran. Perhaps that speaks for any woman for being with such a man....
I don't want to spoil any viewers out there who wish to watch this otherwise obscure flick, but it definitely is a must-see for the diehard John Saxon fan and those who like these kinds of movies. I'm just a bit surprised that this film never was released to this side of the Atlantic, even if it is a B-movie. ;-)",1237161600,,2060,4.496
