7901708,5,9627146706,"I remember when this used to come on ""CBS late night"" on Fridays paired with the New Avengers. Kind of a resurgence of 60s british TV in the late 70s.  I really loved both shows for the refreshing story arcs and the music as well.  The first few notes of the Theme song just kind of gets in your head and stays there. In some ways it has a similar feel to the Avengers, though also a lot like The Equalizer and that type of genre as well.
  Can't wait to get this on DVD in NTSC, hopefully will be released soon. Though I am tempted to buy this one since I do have a region free player somewhere. Would be best if they released it in a bluray, then it would defintiely be worth the $70+ buckaroos.
  I never saw the original The Saint series (with Roger Moore) until after I had seen this series, so to ME this WAS the original! I also preferred it in color. Tried to watch the old series since Roger Moore was a familiar face, but just never could get into the older series.
  It was a great comeback, wish it had lasted longer.",1297555200,2,1029,4.08457711442786
