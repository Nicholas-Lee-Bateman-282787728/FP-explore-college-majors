8584020,3,B00COQQ2SC,"Good quality video, however, I would have preferred all ""Lone Ranger"" instead of ""The Cisco Kid"".  My biggest disappointment is the lack of closing credits.  Why they edited out the cast and credits is a mystery.  It's a big enough deal to make me look for another collection!",1471305600,,276,4.708333333333333

8584025,4,B00COQQ2SC,They could have better editing but by and large they brought a smile to my face.  I would have preferred to get 4 discs of the Lone Ranger but the Cisco Kid was also part of my youth.,1381968000,,183,3.8157894736842106
