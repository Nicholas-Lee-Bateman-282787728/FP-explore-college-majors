4055061,5,B0032AM8QE,"First the shooting from a vehicle part was awesome and I have never even heard of that being broken down so such a science. That alone was worth the price of the DVD. The DVD was over 2 hours so it was tons of information to absorb. I have many other Videos from AGI, Gunvideo, and Paladin. This video has by far, without a doubt the most information in a DVD of any of them. Very impressive instructor, he shoots from undercover, with no sights on the pistol fast and accurate. Also he demonstrates shooting from the hip and shows how and when to properly use this technique. The best one of the series.",1268611200,,604,4.307017543859649
4055062,2,B0032AM8QE,"It was decent, but not worth $40 in my opinion.  Maybe $10 would be appropriate for the amount of material covered and the fact that overall it was poorly directed.  Could have used a little editting and reshoots for some of the obvious mistakes made by the instructors.  Overall not nearly as much content as the description would lead you to believe.  For example... balistics test of cover... one shot to a concrete block.  Sorry... I really wanted this to be worth it, but pretty cheesy.",1268092800,3,491,4.662790697674419

4055065,5,B0032AM8QE,"I took the actual course from Garret, and it was the most informative and comprehensive shooting course I've ever taken.  I immediately came home and bought the DVD so I'd always have it on hand for refreshers.

Every move is thought out and vital to survival.  Of course, on a DVD you can't get the real life experience or the stress factor that you would have with a live class (which I recommend everyone take if you ever get the chance to study with this man), but it's a good enough close second.

I use the principles I learned in the class and DVD to teach my own adult children how to shoot safely and effectively.

This man is no joke.  He knows his business and knows how to teach it.  I highly recommend this DVD.",1341014400,2,724,4.279411764705882
4055066,2,B0032AM8QE,"This video focuses on concealed carry with the pistol in condition amber (no bullet in the chamber. They teach that one should cock the pistol on the draw, which is slow and ridiculous, as the Israelis train to the lowest common denominator and don't trust people to carry with a loaded gun. I timed the fastest draw and shot by their experts and they were all over 2 seconds; I can draw from concealment and make head shots at 5 yards in .75 seconds, and can train just about anyone to draw and fire within a second from concealment. Also, they teach a very static shooting position that does not lend well to real-world moving while shooting and a gripping technique that have been proven to be much less accurate and slower than the modern overlapping thumbs method. In talking to REAL IDF folks, they disregard this stupid methodology and carry with one in the chamber when they expect trouble.

4055068,5,B0032AM8QE,"I thought this DVD was a great representation of the Israeli method of combat shooting. After I watched the DVD I went and took a training course with Garret. I took the course in Tallahassee Florida and was very impressed with the drills offered in the class. One of the greatest things I got out of the class was the Israeli Combat Mindset. I would say that the greatest thing i got out of the class was the mindset aspect. For example, Garret explained that ""criminals are money motivated and escape oriented"" while ""Terrorists are blood motivated and don't care about escape, they are ready to die"" Meaning that as westerners we need to be able to wrap out heads arount their thinking to combat them. The Israelis have a totaly different TTP then their US counterparts, in that they always close distance and never retreat.",1324166400,3,827,4.671232876712328
4055069,4,B0032AM8QE,"Substance over style.

If you have read all of the reviews then I have nothing to add. But I can offer you some behind the scenes info. I am a former US Marine and a currently work as a certified firearms instructor/trainer, as well as, a sworn LEO. I was introduced to the Israeli method many years ago by other US military personal that had been trained in Israel. I have accumulated quite the library of books and dvds on the Israeli method over the last two decades. If you are looking for studio production videos, then these dvds are not for you. These were made by a couple of young soldiers while on leave from active duty with some of their friends, to chronicle what they had learned, as well as, what they taught to others.  If you are looking for a simple, concise and no nonsense style of training that gives you wealth of information than look no further.

If you don't like the Israeli method that's fine, it is your choice. But if you are looking for a safer alternative for weapons carry then the Israeli method is a viable option. It has been the practice of millions for decades and is still in practice worldwide, as well as, in many US Military instillations. And like is or not, many US civilians carry Condition 3. If this is how they are going to carry than these dvds are a useful tool.

I am a student, as well as, an instructor who wishes to learn and glean all that I can from others. The Israeli method is not the only method or necessarily even the best methodology available...but it among the best that I have encountered. I would not be ashamed to put this training up against any other that is currently available and feel quite comfortable recommending this style and these dvds to others.

I did my own research and background checks and I can affirm that Garret is who he claims to be.  And I admit I am biased since I recently had Garret conduct a two-day pistol course at our range. What you won't get from these dvds? The intensity and passion embodied in the training provided by Garret are unparalleled. This you will not get unless you personally attend one of his classes. And these classes are light years beyond what is on the dvds. The Israeli method is much more than just a style of weapons deployment or tactics. Those are just individual components of a larger whole that comprise being a Security Warrior.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars was due to the low budget cinematography.",1318204800,16,2434,4.443946188340807
4055070,5,B0032AM8QE,"I've taken a few local courses on handgun use. This video goes above and beyond the courses I've taken. After practicing the concepts taught in this video, the viewer should feel much more confident in their use and safe handling of a pistol. After purchasing numerous videos on handgun use, Garret's videos are the only ones I have not returned for a refund.",1315526400,,359,4.714285714285714
4055071,1,B0032AM8QE,"First, BEFORE READING MY REVIEW, LOOK AT THE OTHER REVIEWS FOR THOSE WHO RATED THIS DVD 5-STARS (There is a link to the right).  You will see the only other reviews they have are for all the other DVDs in the series (also all 5-stars), can you say fake-reviews?

I am a (real/certified) weapons and tactics instructor and retired US military who has trained with Israeli Special Forces.  Always wanting to hone my skills, another instructor and I bought this DVD to pick up some pointers.  All we learned is that anyone with digital video recorder and an empty basement can get $40 for a shooting video.

There is so much wrong with this video, I don't have time to type out the details.  Buy this video and you'll get 2-guys with a camera in their basement making fools of themselves.

A few ""highlights"" about the video and what you'll learn:
Don't let anyone tell you to walk around without a round in the chamber!  Are you kidding me?  Their reason is because of weapons retention?  Any ""warrior"" wouldn't plan there carry condition around the assumption that someone is going to take their gun!  And if they get the gun, guess what they're going to do...rack a round and blow your head off!

Their stance has the guy so off balance, I'd love to see him actually try to shoot and move...looks like his sitting on a toilet!

Finally, with regard to trigger control you'll learn how to ""pull through the soft - into the hard""...STOP!  This is a joke!  What happened to a smooth press to the rear?

To be honest, I couldn't finish watching this video...it's that bad and I didn't want to waste any more of my day (I need to get to the range).  Don't waste your time or money.  You'd be a better shooter by taking $40 and burning it!",1306195200,8,1733,4.447619047619048
4055072,5,B0032AM8QE,"We are at the golden age of training right now. I learned a lot from these Israeli DVDs, tactically, like no matter what they do, they are moving or shooting. They are moving off the ""X"" when they draw their weapons, change magazines or fix jams. They are very very aggressive about each move they make and precise. But more interestingly I learned that here in the US we have a different concept and philosophy about guns and their application. The Israeli method is quite different in that it is more about combat and fighting then anything else.

As it has been said before, it is a lot easier to train a warrior how to use a new weapon then it is to train an expert marksman to be a warrior. The type of training mentality in this DVD is combat doctrine, not just pistol craft or marksmanship. Unfortunately we are facing more and more incidences and attacks that this type of training would be suited for. Active shooters and terrorists have taken US law enforcement by surprise, and will continue to do so without a move to a more military minded type of response.

No DVD will take the place of real life training and I would recommend to anyone who wants to learn this type of ""Mentality"" to seek a qualified instructor.

I am no expert, but I do have some experience and have done plenty of research. Here is what I think:

* This DVD was clearly shot on a budget. There is no fancy camera work or editing. This is not a commercial for products or an action movie, although there is a sports car and speed boat in the movie. Some times the sound quality is poor. Sometimes you hear the wind. Some times the lighting is not studio quality. Bottom line; this is a single camera shoot with minimal money invested.

* There are people who will give this DVD less then stellar reviews for one of two reasons, or both. One, they can't wrap their head around the idea of closing distance and being aggressive (Counter terrorism). Or two, they do not understand why the Israelis chamber a round just before firing. Why no bullet in the barrel? It would be unfair to knock a DVD on the Israeli method because it is, well, the Israeli method. But let me say this; In the United States we have a hand gun culture that dictates the necessity of carrying a round in the chamber. This comes from the old west, cowboys and Indians. The first modern hand guns carried on the hip of pioneers, ranchers, cowboys and the average citizen were revolvers, six shooters. The design of this gun dictates that there is virtually no choice but to have a bullet in the barrel. The nature of the weapon is to have a heavy trigger due to the action or necessity to cock the weapon before firing in some models. When the transition was made from the revolver to the semiautomatic pistol some of the first designs also had a very low magazine capacity. In example one of the most popular designs of the semiautomatic was the colt 1911. The 1911 was chambered in .45 and had an 8 round magazine capacity. Not much more then the revolver. Another early semi auto pistol was the browning high power which had a 13 round capacity.

As one can see the transition from a chambered revolver to a chambered semi auto was logical. A pistol such as the Glock, which is becoming the standard among law enforcement, is built without a safety. The weapon is safe if you are safe, but it seems as though there are a lot of accidental shootings in the American law enforcement community. Shootings of ones self seem to be quite prevalent. In other armed societies, like Russia or Israel for example, it is standard to carry with an empty chamber. In these countries the negligent discharge rate is far lower then the united states. This is due to the fact that most accidents in the US occur when the officer or citizen is holstering a loaded gun without a safety, like a Glock.

In Israel for example every 18 year old is drafted to the military and will come home with a gun after a week or two of training. A fully automatic rifle with ammo is brought home by fresh out of high school 18 year olds. Lets not talk about what would happen in our country if we did the same. These youths in Israel have the same responsibility to respond to terrorism as any police officer has in society, the off duty solders do not carry a round in the chamber. They chamber immediately before firing. One could research online to find out that the rate of negligent discharge in the discussed setting is quite few (about 2 a year for the whole country). Gunfights are not won on the draw.

Consider this fact; the Canadian Boarder Security Agency (CBSA) has 4800 armed officers on the books. During an 18 month period spanning 2008 to 2009 they had no incident of drawing their pistols in the line of duty, not one. But they did have 67 accidental shootings. Sadly 4 of those accidents resulted in death.

*the instruction is clear and follows a very understandable, logical and liner fashion.

*No gear is discussed, that's a good thing.

Bottom line:

You will learn something.

Police will have to adopt this mind set to combat terrorism when it arrives here.",1297987200,14,5111,4.476906552094522
4055073,5,B0032AM8QE,"Defiantly not your typical pistol course or concealed carry course. This course is based on the Israeli system and the threats they face. The instructors in the course have a very different philosophy about dealing with combat and weapons. The difference in culture and mentality comes out in this course. This course combined Krav Maga, and pistol combat together. I have never seen or heard of a course being offered that has both, together, in one system, hand to hand and pistol. But it all makes sense and is logical. What do you do if you close distance and you gun jams? Fight! That's another thing, to participate you must be fit to fight. These guys are in great shape, young and energetic. Mose instructors here in the US have a lot of police experience and are an older crowd. This group has a lot of young energy and enthusiasm. They have a whole system that they brought here from the IDF. You see they never said ""I invented this"" or ""Its our system that this school invented or came up with"". They simply give you the same training that they received, used to fight terrorism, and tough in the IDF. So you know it will work in a worst case scenario.",1297814400,,1164,4.495283018867925
4055074,5,B0032AM8QE,"This is an authentic representation of Israeli combat shooting as it is used in Israel today. If safety is your number one priority then this is a great system for civilian carry (No bullet in the barrel). In Israel far more people carry handguns and rifles in civilian life per capita and have far fewer accidents then professionals here in the US. To back up this bold statement I have the following statistics:

The NYPD firearms discharge report for the year 2004 (as published by WCBS). In that year police engaged in 11 gunfights (exchange of fire between officers and subjects).  In those 11 gun fights, there were 92 shots fired by police officers and 18 of the 92 were hits, that's 20% accuracy. In the same year there were 27 accidental discharges of an officer's duty firearm. Of those 27 accidental discharges, 28 shots were fired and 13 were hits. 13 of 28 or 46% of shots fired hit the officer or bystander.

In the year 2005 there were 16 gun fights and 24 accidental discharges of firearms. In those 16 gun fights 35 officers fired. The officers fired a total of 276 rounds hitting their target only 23 times. That is a dismal 8% accuracy rate. The average was 17 shots fired per incident and 8 per officer. In 2005 25 accidental shots were fired by 24 NYPD police officers hitting 10 times, with an unfortunate accuracy rating of 42 percent.

Unfortunately in the US the police are much more likely to shoot themselves or a bystander then they are to engage a criminal in an actual gunfight. I have been a police officer for 8 years with a major department, which I will not mention. I will tell you that we are under trained, and certainly not trained to deal with terrorism or be ""Aggressive"".  I would love more training for my department, especially a CT course.

Further this DVD features the Glock pistol. The Glock holds 17 rounds in the handle. This is much better then a single stack and necessary when undercover or concealed (That's all you have) to match the firepower of a terrorist threat. The Glock is a modern Counter terrorist weapon used by more CT units world wide then any other pistol.

This DVD is specifically for counter terrorism, not criminal incidents. The Israeli system is an aggressive one, for active shooter neutralization. Law enforcement agencies world wide, mostly, do not use the lock and load technique, and they use the Glock pistol more then any other manufacturer. Simplicity, reliability, light weight, inexpensive, high capacity, etc.

Racking the firearm off the pant leg or belt is also covered in this DVD. It is an essential technique to learn when dealing with malfunctions and reloads when one hand is injured or otherwise occupied.

This system is highly aggressive, because that is what is proven to defeat a terrorist threat.  Unlike the big names in the industry and experts in ""Civilian and LE carry"" The instructors in this DVD are veterans of  Israeli counter terror units. Meaning they have actual experience, in combat, against terrorists. Not theoretical, or maybe one gun fight in 20 years of service cop experience. If you want Israeli counter terrorism techniques, as in Israel, then this is the DVD for you. If you want the traditional and reputable NRA/US LE style then this DVD series is far from it.",1297555200,10,3281,4.73859649122807
4055075,2,B0032AM8QE,"Yes, this might still be the way it's taught in Israel (I did KM at Wingate in the 1980s) but charging or racking the gun out of the holster the way these instructors are doing it is very bad practice. I am a trained martial artist (40 years)/certified handgun instructor and can say unequivocally, do not carry this way! In Israel everyone is supposedly a ""counter-terrorist"" (it's part of their psyche) yet far more Israelis get injured by preventable handgun accidents than by terrorists. This is because the IDF's primary weapon is the military rifle, M-16. Pistols are not primary. Their M-16 instruction is the among the best in the world. Their handgun training is poor. This video is really skewed towards a practice against combative terrorists, in which the handgun is rarely used. Also, they are exclusively using a Glock, mainly because there is no slide safety and the belief is that there is little time to acclimate soldiers to using the safety on a pistol which has one (or a decocker.) However, proper training (weeks rather than hours) makes ""lock and load"" the acknowledged best and safest practice for civilian or Law Enforcement carry worldwide. If carrying a Glock, you carry loaded and need to be careful that you do not snag the trigger safety (not an easy thing to do if you're conscious of it through training.) And under stress, you will not rack that easily first thing out of the holster. Too complex, not instinctive. I carry a 1911 and the first thing I do out of the holster is ""off safety"" and the first thing when returning to holster is ""on safety"" with a loaded pistol. It's second nature because I train this way, and because it's a simple thumb movement, not requiring as much ""hands on"" as a rack. There are many other reasons why safeties are extremely important - proven assets. But to rack a slide (especially one with a heavy recoil spring) on most automatics off the pant leg is nonsense and dangerous. By using a safety and carrying loaded (and preferably locked,) I can shoot one handed or two handed without racking against a leg, hoping a round is chambered. Also, most of what these instructors are doing is ""safety unconscious."" There is a scene where one guy is shooting at multiple targets outdoors and he's completely unaware that there's a real person in frame, ""down range"" of him. He just keeps on shooting, oblivious (tunnel vision.) You cannot go out in civilian society and use this kind of aggression. You will end up in jail, guaranteed! And shooting from inside a car is illegal! And never try to clear a boat, call S.W.A.T. for that if you suspect something is up. Again, you will end up in jail, or dead! The true professional firearms instructor considers safety primary, teaches safety above everything else. These instructors, though adept with their action movie techniques, fall way short of professional standards for civilian or LE carry. Their methods are only for outright combat with attacking terrorists, and even then... Better spend money on Jeff Cooper's series, shot in the 1980s but still quite apropos (NRA, Gunsight and Frontsight and most reputable training programs still use Cooper's methods with very few modifications,) or read one of Massad Ayoob's books, which teaches proper handgun technique and mindset in a civilian world, or one of Lawrence Kane or Rory Miller's books on violence and SD, etc. Best, find a good instructor who teaches safety first methods.",1297468800,6,3450,4.849152542372881

The emphasis on drawing an empty pistol ( almost everytime on the dvd)then presenting the pistol at eye level before charging or cocking could get you killed on real time. Combat is always about speed and accuracy and a fully loaded gun is imperative element in a gunfight. Also, clearing a house (more so a boat) is best done by professionals with sufficient back-up. Dont do this unless your family is in danger and time is of the essence before authorities arrived. Likewise, the instructions on clearing malfunctions is hard to master(especially level 3 and one hand reloading). Best to carry a BUG (back-up gun) easier and faster.

The cost is not worth  the content.,1274918400,9,502,4.344086021505376
4055089,5,B0032AM8QE,"The Israeli method of pistol handling has been used by the IDF since the 1980's. The method has been continually enhanced over the years by the Israeli special forces counter terror units and also by the IDF counter terror school. This DVD is the methodology in its latest form. The DVD covers all the original old school, draw cock and shoot, stuff plus a host of other topics. most buyers will want the DVD for the basic Israeli combat point shooting system, but you will find that is just the first half hour or so, then there is tones of other information not typically taught by firearms instructors. I would say $40. is worth it, for the amount of information and quality of instruction.",1269734400,2,693,4.596774193548387

4055091,5,B0032AM8QE,"So this DVD has tons of information you will not get in a course you actually go and physically  take. I have taken a few different courses from Israeli instructors who teach ""Israeli Instinctive Shooting""  and LOTAR and KM. I also spoke to people at these courses about other schools and training courses offered it the Israeli method. I can tell you hands down no one I have heard of or found in this field is teaching shooting from a moving vehicle, working on a boat, and all the urban stuff he covers in such deep detail. Many instructors at their courses do not demonstrate all the drills in front of you live fire. In this DVD there is a section where one of the instructors draws from cover, charges the pistol and hits the targets under time at set distances. The times, distances and accuracy are not the best out their, but i would say better than anyone I have seen do the same type of drill (Israeli Instinctive Point Shooting) and probably better they 90% of instructors out there, and he takes the sight off the gun to prove he is only pointing and not aiming. A great DVD overall, perhaps sound quality could have been better. I would recommend it.",1268870400,7,1164,4.460093896713615

8387377,5,B0032AM8QE,"*** DISCLAIMER*** Before purchasing this DVD i emailed Garret Machine and asked if any of his books or DVD's covered what i was interested in learning, this is the one he suggested***
-------
I have long had an interest in the Israeli method of carry, however most of what you read on gun forums today states that if you aren't carrying ""cocked and locked"", ""condition 1"" or ready to ""rock and roll"" well you might as well be carrying nothing, either that or you are scared of your gun.  Well this DVD proves otherwise!!

This method works and has done for well over 50 years, this is the method taught in Israel (to soldiers and civilians alike) and the method they use even though they are surrounded by nations who want them dead. This method also works for every semi auto pistol from the Glock they use in the DVD to 1911's and all points between.

Watching the DVD did raise a few questions and i sent Garret Machine a further email. He was more than happy to answer my questions, which ranged from a few technical issues (sound and menu) to questions about the gun used in the DVD. He was also happy to explain the reasoning behind certain techniques that are used.  This served to increase my understanding of the thinking behind why they do what they do and helped increase my knowledge when i watched the DVD a second time.

When Garret recommended this particular DVD i saw the price and i guess you could say i had sticker shock. However i went and read all the other reviews on amazon and decided that all these people cant be wrong. After having watched the DVD i am glad that i made the purchase, the information contained in it is well worth the price. There is a distinct lack of ""fluff"" and whilst some reviews derided the lack of  ""Hollywood"" i say that it is rawer and more real.

All in all this is a very good DVD that is very informative and very easy to understand how and why things are done using the Israeli method. I would highly recommend this to anybody who chooses to carry a gun, whether you are a civilian, a first responder or a member of our armed forces.

Put simply this stuff works and this DVD shows you how.",1410307200,3,2147,4.376884422110553
