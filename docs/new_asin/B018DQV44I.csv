The Carol Burnett Show will appeal to two types of people:  those who remember watching it when they were younger and respond to the pull of nostalgia, and those who are curious about a time in American television when variety shows, not reality shows, were popular. Burnett was arguably the best of all the variety show hosts, a multitalented woman who could sing, dance, act, impersonate famous stars, and make a comedy sketch work with ad libs better than anyone else. Because of her long-running TV show, which initially aired from 1967-1978, Burnett was toasted at a 2003 Kennedy Center Honors and also awarded the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in 2013. During its time, the show earned 68 Primetime Emmy nominations and won Golden Globes as the Best TV Show--Comedy or Musical in 1971. Burnett herself won five Golden Globes for her work on the series, and her talented regulars pulled down a few as well:  Harvey Korman in 1967, and Tim Conway in 1976.

As Tina Fey remarked at the presentation of the Mark Twain Prize,  I fell in love with sketch comedy watching your show, and you proved sketch comedy is a good place for women . . . . Only in sketch comedy does a woman get to play Cher, Scarlett OHara, the Queen of England, and Girl Scout, Mrs. Wigginsall in one night. At that same event comedian Martin Short summarized the long reach of her Burnetts influence: Everyone copied from her. There wouldnt be Saturday Night Live without Carol. So keep that in mind as you watch this pioneering comedy-variety show, which featured guest stars in musical numbers as well as sketches, and in which Burnett did indeed play almost anyone. This collection shows how wide of a range she had, and she was particularly on in sketches that aped other actresses. Included here is a sketch in which she pokes fun of Joan Crawford in Mildred Fierce and really nails Katharine Hepburn in Guess Whats Coming to Dinner?

Like a previous Lost Episodes release, this collection features 15 uncut episodes on six single-sided DVDs, with episodes culled from the first four seasons.

Fans of Saturday Night Live will marvel at how LONG these sketches go on, how character-driven they are, and ultimately how much the players trust the material and their performances. It will also seem amazing to people of the anti-social social media generation that at the beginning of each show Burnett strides out in a gown that was glamorous then (kitschy now) and answers questions from a live audience. When an adolescent boy asks if he can read a poem he wrote for her and she says, Sure, stand up and read it, could you see that happening today? He starts reading the poem and when he gets to the part where he says hes in love with a girl old enough to be his mother, she says, Sit down. In a truly historical moment, then Gov. Ronald Reagan walks onstage to join Carol in that opening Q&A and answers questions from the audienceone of them from a woman who asks if he has any interest in moving to Washington, D.C. His response is what youd expect from a man known as the Great Communicator:  he says he cant see why anyone would ever want to leave California. Earlier he had gotten a big laugh when he offered a comic counterpunch. A woman asked, Does the mayor know you're in town? Everyone laughed and Reagan shot back with, The important thing is, is Yorty in town? Mayor Sam Yorty had a number of nicknames, among them Travelin Sam, Suitcase Sam, and Airplane Sam.

There are some terrific sketches here, as well as some that aren't so successful. Ultimately, though, the sketches seem less dated than the clothes or the musical numbers, and they are the reason people remember Carol Burnett and buy DVDs like this.  The fun is in watching how many different characters Burnett can convincingly pull off, and whether she can stay in character or crack up with her co-stars. Some of her characters are convincingly ugly, others glamorous, and she even dons a Bugs Bunny costume for a sketch paying tribute to Warner Bros. animation. You get the feeling that Burnett would do anything for a laugh, and she provides a lot of them in this collection.",1455408000,9,5227,4.87260428410372

I would ONLY recommend this video for a die hard Burnett fan. The skits that come to mind when I think of Carol Burnett, are the famous ones like...when she played Scarlet O'Hara and wore the curtains, or the episodes with her at ""Momma's House"". None of those skits are in this CD. If you can find this product for like...99 cents and you get free shipping it could be a good gift for someone you don't like.",1482796800,,553,4.326923076923077

I ordered another box set about 10 years ago, and now I have just received and watched a new 11-disc ""LOST EPISODES/TREASURES FROM THE VAULT.""  There wasn't one. damn. episode that I was looking forward to seeing.  There was no Mrs. Hu-Wiggins.  There was no Tim Conway - Old Man.  There was no Scarlett O'Hara curtain-rod dress.  There was no Eunice and Family!  It was gradually frustrating to switch in disk after disk with no Eunice, No Alan Alda as the brother working as a commercial artist, no Mama.  Just a bunch of mediocre skits, lame song and dance, and speeches.  RAagughgghh!!  Why, Carol, WHY?!?!  Why did you do this to me ... two times, now.  I'll never trust you and your hour-long infomercials again.",1482192000,2,802,4.609929078014185

the late 1960's and 1970's that the collection featured.  I wish that each and every one of her shows was available, but for now, this collection and
a few of the others now available will make you laugh and enjoy show business at its best, and bring you back to those classic days.  I think people who don't remember these shows would still enjoy it too.  There are so many extras, including interviews, and comments.  Keep these collections coming out, they are so good.  Carol Burnett is wonderful, back then and now!  Thank you!",1461888000,5,675,4.621848739495798
