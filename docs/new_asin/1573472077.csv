8228162,1,1573472077,"Terrible directing, visuals, and everything you can imagine. Not worth a dime. Story is ludicrous and the actors do their best, but what can you do with this terrible material. No nudity, the actors don't kiss, and everything is faked. Everyone was turning in a ""performance"" - if you could call it that - for the paycheck. And no wonder. There is more sex and graphics on television than in this yucky pile of.  .  .  Yes, sometimes the actors are partially nude, but you really don't see anything at all - and who cares by the way - but everything looks so fake you can't believe it. No one kisses at all. Not sure how this is considered soft anything. Yes, everyone involved probably got paid -- but for your sake, don't even bother. Unfortunately, it's not even worth a laugh. There aren't any.",1350864000,,798,4.489655172413793
