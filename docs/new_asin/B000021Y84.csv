1249215,5,B000021Y84,"This tape is one of the best. The first episode was pretty good though the nudity was not needed. Ryoko finally learns the truth about her partner after he tries to kill her. Tenchi finds out the truth about Sakuya. The next episode is about how Tanchi is the planets guardian. I also enjoyed the different end song on episode 2 as it was really sweet and sad.
The third episode is one of my faves and has a very surprising twist but it is really romantic :)
The final episode is ok but i personally thought that Universe had a better finale. Tenchi talks to Yugi and she agrees to go with them peacefully to the shrine. The ending was not what i was expecting but it was ok and the animation was really good.
I would recommend this to fans but be warned it won't be what you were expecting.",1005696000,,791,4.2105263157894735
1249216,3,B000021Y84,"Tenchi in Tokyo was not a bad series, but it was a blemish on the Tenchi series. The animation was poor at best, and the story lacked the excitement and surprises that the OVA and first series brought to the screen. If you're a die hard Tenchi fan then by all means buy it, but if you want a better quality anime, go with Muyo and/or Universe.",979430400,,343,4.134328358208955
1249217,5,B000021Y84,"The grand finally to Tenchi in Tokyo should be a must-have for any Tenchi fan. As Sakuya is driven mad by the fact she knows nothing of her past, Washu discovers that Sakuya is actually a shadow of Yugi. Meanwhile, Kiyone and Mihoshi finish off Subaru and Ryoko takes care of Hotsuma. Yugi takes back control Sakuya, turns to Tokyo to crystal and has Sasami in her custody. Tenchi confronts Yugi with two options. Either he can stay in a dream world with Sakuya forever or sacrafice Sakuya to safe the earth. Tenchi says good bye to Sakuya and Ryoko, Aieka, Kiyone, Mihoshi and Washu all come to Tenchi's aid as well as Sasami. Tenchi summons up the ultimate sword (or power, whatever) and goes after Yugi. Suprisingly, instead of slicing Yugi with the sword, he just slaps some sense into her and comforts her. The show ends up with Yugi putting herself in sleep-mode until she is all grown up. Overall, I liked the ending as it serves up as the most intense volume ever. If you were confused about the last episodes, see this one. It will answer all your questions. Tenchi in Tokyo might not be everyone's favorite of the Tenchi saga, but it is still great.",979344000,,1159,4.523809523809524
1249218,5,B000021Y84,"The last chapter in the Tenchi in Tokyo series is a worthy ending, and it's only at this point that several of the key questions are finally answered. At this stage we know roughly who Yugi is, but what is her  interest and involvement with the Masaki family, and what are her motives,  all is revealed in these final episodes. These final few chapters bring  together all the past elements of the series, including some of the events,  which at the time may have seemed a little strange or unrelated, but now  can be explained, plus this DVD includes the pivotal final battle between  Tenchi and Yugi. If like me, you bought the first Tenchi in Tokyo chapters,  then simply had to buy the rest to follow the unravelling story, this final  addition will not disappoint. The quality of the animation, like the entire  Tokyo series, being TV derived is not quite up to the quality seen in the  OAV series, however it has a unique style and in some ways is more real and  the characters more expressive than seen in the OAV box set. I recommend  this Tokyo series to anyone who has the OVA set and wants more. The quality  may not be as good but the overall story, being slightly less fluffy makes  up for any other short fallings. Does Ryoko or Ayeka ever get Tenchi?  You'll have to watch these final episodes to find out.",961632000,3,1321,4.445833333333334
1249219,5,B000021Y84,"Ok, a lot of people don't like Tenchi in Tokyo (Shin Tenchi for you die hard otaku out there) and I can see why.  It IS different tenchi fare)  I however was one of the few who really enjoyed the story  If you have liked  the series so far you will LOVE the ending because everything finally comes  together and you get to see who sakuya REALLY is.  ^_^",958176000,8,353,4.043478260869565

7915248,4,B000021Y84,"This isn't my favorite Tenchi series, but it's still pretty good. This show starts out with the girls already living at the Masaki home. Tenchi has decided to go to Tokyo to study under a priest and continue high school. The girls are not happy about this obviously. Washu invents a tunnel that can transport them back and forth from the house to Tenchi's apartment. When he arrive in Tokyo he meets a cute girl named Sakuya. She seems normal, and that's a nice change for Tenchi. After they spend more time together things get kind of ugly with the others.

After apparently losing Sakuya to the evil Yugi. Tenchi and the girls come together again and storm Yugi's crystal fortress. Defeating her will not be easy. Especially with the fate of Sakuya inexorably tied to Yugi. Sakuya is no more than a fragment of Yugi's soul broken off to achieve the goal of breaking Tenchi's friends apart. The conclusion is pretty shocking, but there is a reason to hope for a bright future.

This is a different look at a very familiar series. The animation is different, and I like the new character, but overall it falls short of the original series, and Tenchi Universe.",1353024000,,1160,4.62621359223301
7915249,4,B000021Y84,"In this series; Tenchi has packed his bags, moved to work an apprenticeship in Tokyo, and expects to spend the next two years of High School in-residence. A budding attraction forms with a new girl and those left behind at the Masaki home are loosing their ever-lovin' minds.

I always enjoyed the various Tenchi Muyo videos for their variety of characters, wit, and creative plot twists. It was nice to hear many of the English dub voice talents return for this one (which did not happen during the Tenchi Muyo GXP series during original Tenchi cast cameo appearances).

The character animations at times were uncharacteristically way too exaggerated from what we had come to expect from the previous works and seemed to me almost a mockery of the original. As if the animation crew intended to parody or farce the original. Fine had these been ""Slayers"" episodes, but hardly fitting the standard for continuing the Tenchi series.

The banjo music over the end credits and previews in this series did not suit the story. I certainly don't recall any previous refences locating the Masaki homestead and shrine anywhere near Osaka, which is the standard source of cliche' anime ""back-woods country-folk"". The music would have been better suited to say; ""The Beverly Hillbillies Go To Tokyo"" than a Tenchi series. At each end, I half-expected Yosho ""Grandpa"" Masaki, to step out and add; ""Ya'all come back now. Ya' Hear?"" The alternate end credits, used for only one episode, would have been a far better choice.

Overall, I still enjoyed this series, as the episode screenplays at least appeared to faithfully follow the style of the previous installments. The final climax was a bit of an interesting twist from what I expected, but no spoiler will be given here.",1237680000,,1763,4.925925925925926
7915250,5,B000021Y84,"This DVD holds four episodes, giving the viewer a great ending to the story.  As the family comes back together, they each and everyone show that trust and love can truly combine their skills and powers.  Each minion of Yugi's is taken out of action and in the end, with the others' help, Tenchi goes after Yugi herself, armed with a sword made from all the crystals his mother left him.  He must win because if Tenchi fails the Earth is doomed.
But if he kills Yugi he also kills her shadow, the girl he loves, Sakuya!  The ending is somewhat of a surprise, but given Tenchi's nature, maybe it shouldn't of surprised me as much as it did.
I happen to really enjoy the fight between Ryoko and Hotsuma, and the final episode is both touching and very funny.  I also happen to be a fan of Yugi, I really enjoyed her character, even if her fashion sense was a tad on the blah side.",1087603200,2,878,4.265060240963855
7915251,5,B000021Y84,"Starting on this DVD, things start to get more serious. Sakuya realises she can't remember anything before she saw Tenchi. She gets very frightened and she won't let Tenchi do anything without her. Things keep building and the tension keeps growing... As I watched the end of episode 24, ""Yugi's Shadow"", I couldn't help but cry. This is one of the saddest anime episodes ever. ""why did they have to do that??? i liked Sakuya so much!"" This episode definetly knows how to rip your heart out. I don't think there is any sane human who can watch this episode and not feel strong emotions during the Tenchi and Sakuya flashback scene. At the last episode, Tenchi brings Yugi to justice -- but not the way you hoped he would. This final part of one of my favourite series really shows how much emotion can be evoked through animation.",1022544000,,830,4.577181208053691
7915252,5,B000021Y84,"This video is one of the best one in the series in Tenchi In Tokyo.  It is were Tenchi goes to fight Yugi.  With his black Hawk sword in one hand he runs but instead of killing her he soothes her.  Yugi is just a lonely person in the dark and crys she is morose and depress.  It ends up the gang keeping Yugi and lays asleep for years to come until she grows up.  Everybody is please with that.  Since it is Sasamies friend, and who knows Yugi might grow up to look like Saukya one day!",1018915200,,486,3.9081632653061225
7915253,5,B000021Y84,"This is the last episodes to Tenchi In Tokyo. Tenchi falls in love with a popular girl at school named Sakuya. After awhile things start to change. The girls getting spread apart, a evil girl anmed Yugi, her hentchmen, and a beautiful girl to look after. What is this world coming to! Its up to Tenchi to save it all. But doing this may hurt him very badly. Will he save the day or does he want to stay with Sakuya? Watch the series to find out!",1017619200,,445,4.126436781609195
7915254,4,B000021Y84,"the only reasons I can give this DVD 4stars is 1) Ryoko basically gets TEnchi in the end.  2)the shocking way Yugi is fought.  3) it's a Tenchi DVD, and in my opinion that's about as good as it gets.
Sadly, TEnchi in Tokyo, Shin Tenchi to some, isn't that great a series, but the plots are well thought out, even if the animation is lacking.  IF you want good Tenchi DVD's check out the Tenchi Muyo OVA, that is the best of the best.  This series is okay, but never will be as great as the original.",1010620800,,499,4.061224489795919

7915256,5,B000021Y84,"I just got this movie and I watched it over and over and over again. It is fantastic!! There are a lot of sad parts in it though where Tenchi get's his heart ripped out because Sakuya dies because she is called ""Yugi's Shadow"" and Yugi takes her away and kills her. The end is really funny though! Besides Ryoko going swimming without a bathing suit on (don't worry you can't see anything, whew!)this movie is pretty good!! After you see it for the thousanth time like me the commersials get REALLY ANNOYING! Stupid Ryo-ohki (no offence to those fans of her's but if you buy this you will se what i mean)",1007942400,,604,4.353982300884955
