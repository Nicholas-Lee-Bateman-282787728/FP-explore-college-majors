8481615,5,B005ONP7W4,"This PAL format issue of TENSION AT TABLE ROCK (via Regasa Films,Spain) is, at least for the time being, the only DVD release of this classic 1956 Western. It will not play in American NTSC players, but will play in universal/PAL players.

First, a few comments about the film itself; I must admit that I've always loved this oater, perhaps because I saw it with my dad sixty years ago! Since then I've seen it aired on, I think, TNT and a few other channels. It boasts some excellent acting by Richard Egan...he had acted in secondary Western roles with Audie Murphy and Don Murray and a few other stars, but this was his opportunity to headline the cast, and he doesn't disappoint. In a role somewhat reminiscent of SHANE, he injects just the right amount of circumspection and reserve, while non-verbally exhibiting an incredible range of emotions---an estimable feat. But Egan is backed up by an equally fine cast: the sultry Dorothy Malone, her cowardly husband Cameron Mitchell (again, underplaying nicely his role), Royal Dano (one of the finest character actors of the 1950s who does not disappoint here either), Edward Arnold (as the sneering saloon owner), the dependable John Dehner (as the trail boss) , and a youngish
DeForrest Kelley (as the gunslinger Egan must face at the end of the movie).

The action is well-handled. There is never a dull moment, and I should highlight the final gunfight,one of the best of its kind, worth waiting for (and watch for Arnold's demise,too!). Photography is expertly handled. And, very  impressively, RKO, already then lumbering towards extinction, acquired Dmitri Tiomkin to write the haunting score that remains with you long after the film ends.

The dependable Charles Marquis Warren directs,and he does so expertly. So, what we have is one of the better Westerns of 1956, one that will repayreviewing and maintain the interest.

Now, just a brief word about the quality of the transfer. Although the print is not up to the highest standards---it seems a bit washed out at times---it is more than acceptable. I have seen and enjoyed far worse, Indeed, it is clear and quite watchable. I won't quibble;after all we shouldn't expect a SILVERADO or WYATT EARP. Still, as this RKO product did show up on TNT when they were showing Westerns, there is always hope that an American transfer (on Warner Archive?) might show up one day.

But, in the meantime, I can heartily recommend this release. If you have a universal or PAL DVD player, go for it. If you enjoy a good, suspenseful Western, you'll enjoy this one.",1482451200,,2563,4.853546910755148

I was unfamiliar with Regasa Films prior to this purchase.  They have a couple of other titles in which I was interested, but considering the high price and sub-standard picture quality of this release, I think I'll pass.",1325376000,7,386,5.063492063492063
