7883379,5,6305107750,"Step Up To Dance is a 58 minute dance-inspired cardio-step workout followed by Pilates based core work.  The step choreography is inspired by ballet, jazz, and modern dance, but also includes basic to intermediate level cardio stepping moves.  Lisa Wheeler (who has appeared in other Method workouts, and has choreographed lots of other instructors workouts) leads the workout.  Appearing with her are two females:  Marjon Couteaux (pronounced mar-he-own coo-toe, who leads&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Method-Dynamic-Toning/dp/B000077VQT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Method: Dynamic Toning</a>) and Lakey Evans (who leads&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Method-Dynamic-Firming-Flexing/dp/B00007JZYN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Method: Dynamic Firming & Flexing</a>), and two men:  Dave and Jeffrey (Jeffrey Scott, who has appeared in several Reebok workouts and leads The Trainers Edge:  Integrated Strength Training).  A live percussion group plays in the background to pleasant (recorded) flamenco music, with a harpist appearing with them (but only for the warmup).  Besides a step platform (Lisa and cast appear to use a 6-inch platform), youll need a balance stick/dowel (or as Lisa calls it a Method Toning Bar; you can also use a broomstick).  If you're on a hard surface, have a mat for the core work.

Ill break down each workout chapter below.

WARM UP (6:18)
Lisa begins with a mix of low-level cardio moves (step touches and grapevines), three taps onto the step with a march on the floor, and dynamic stretching (clearly inspired by ballet, both on and off the step).  The sequence is then repeated on the left side, but the taps sequence changes to two taps on the step followed by a cross ball-change (or pas de bourree) on the floor transition.

STEP AEROBICS (31:17)
In this section, Lisa builds and performs four 32-count combinations, taking a brief lower body toning interval in between teaching each combination.  The first combo is taught more slowly than the other three.  Each combo contains a mix of step and floor moves, and are moderate level in complexity.  Lisa will often perform a basic move, then gradually layer a change each time (telling you to stay with my friends while demonstrating a change).  Or, shell perform a sequence and gradually reduce the number of repetitions of moves.  After teaching a combo, Lisa and crew pick up the dowel for a lower body strength interval.  The first one is a rear lunge with a front kick (after teaching combo 2, this is repeated on the other side), the second one is inner thigh lifts done in a turned-out attitude position (again, this is done on the other side after teaching combo 4).  After teaching each combo and performing the lower body intervals, Lisa reviews all four combinations (right and left leads), taking basic steps after performing each combination.  Once all four combos are reviewed, Lisa strings or TIFTs (Taking It From The Top) them together into one long combination, which is performed twice without stopping.  This means youll do Combo 1 right lead, combo 1 left lead, combo 2 right lead, etc. without stopping.  There is no weaving or zig-zag pattern done to the combinations.  Finally, to cool down, Lisa performs alternating basic steps slowing down to taps onto the step and the floor.  Surprisingly, no much-needed stretches are done here.

ABS & COOL DOWN (19:49)
You won't need your step for this section of the workout, which is Pilates and yoga-based (for the ab work and cool down, respectively).  Lisa begins with slow crunches (crunch up 2 counts, hold 4 counts, then lower 2 counts), later adding an arm movement on the hold.  Lower ab work is next, lowering the toes to the floor from tabletop position (legs at right angles with shins parallel to the floor) with the neck and shoulders lifted from the floor.  To work the obliques, Lisa performs the Criss Cross (Pilates move, also called a bicycle crunch)holding 4 counts each side (before switching), reducing to 2 counts, then singles.  Roll-ups are next, followed by single and double leg teasers (with the male exercisers showing a shortened range of motion, rolling up only the head and shoulders from the floor).  The ab work is finished with two forearm planks held for 30 seconds each, adding alternating leg raises on the second plank.

Lisa begins the yoga-based cool down/stretch with two half sun salutations (or sun breaths), before doing a stretch series on one side:  pyramid pose, crescent pose (or runners lunge), and a balancing stretch.  The stretch series is then repeated on the other side.

This is a fun workout that Ive had for three  years now.  While it isn't heavy in my rotation anymore, I revisited it several weeks ago and found it just as fun and challenging as when I started using it. However, the workout does have some small quirks Id like to point out.  First, while Lisas cueing is good, I found the third combo a little hard to follow the first few times.  This is mainly due to her failure to cue which leg to step up with (as the lead legs alternate on various steps during the combo).  I was able to catch onto the choreography after about three times of using this workout.  Also, the toning breaks were too short to provide any benefits, and I wish that Lisa could have used this time to teach one or two more combinations.  The cool-down is non-existent before going down to the floor, and I find myself stopping the workout to allow my heart rate to drop and to allow for much-needed stretching of my leg and hip muscles.  Im an intermediate-level exerciser, and found my heart rate was still high from the TIFT (even as Lisa begins to wind down with alternating taps).  Lastly, I disliked how the ab and cool down segment was done with shoes on (Yoga and Pilates workouts are performed barefoot).  Quirks aside, this is a very fun step workout that is great for branching out into more moderate level (but not overly complex) choreography.  I highly recommend it to intermediate level steppers.  Advanced steppers will find this workout a refreshing change of pace from their more intense workouts.",1487376000,,6449,5.107824427480916

7883381,4,6305107750,"This is a step routine with intermediate intensity and choreography. I did not think this was hard to do and was able to get it on the first time through. The instructor is very pleasant and cues well. I'm not sure why the word 'Dance' is in the title of this video, because it's more athletic than dancy. To keep my heart rate up I had to add more high-impact moves like jogging instead of marching and running up instead of stepping up, but overall not a bad workout for a lighter day.",1230508800,,487,4.247311827956989
7883382,5,6305107750,"I really enjoy The Method and this one is one of my favorites.  I appreciate a good challenge, and you will certainly get that in this video.  I like any video that incorporates cardio with toning and stretching.  You get all three in this one.  I am not sure I understand the confusion other reviewers experienced about this being a step video.  If the title didn't give it away, the fact that the instructor is on the cover standing on a step and the description on the back of the video should have!",1146268800,2,502,4.354838709677419
7883383,4,6305107750,"The first two times I went through this video, I couldn't keep up and got really frustrated.  Now that I have practiced a bit and mastered the routines, this is my current favorite video.  I get a really nice workout and I don't get bored.  If you like step aerobics and you have some patience to learn a routine, this is a great video.  If you want something really straight forward with a solid no fuss workout, you may want to look at other videos like Kathy Smith or Keli Roberts.",1102464000,11,484,4.285714285714286
7883384,1,6305107750,"I like to be able to do most of the steps in an exercise video the first time I try it but, barring that, I like to be able to tell that I will be able to learn to do it in the future.  This instructor (she's kind of lackluster and not inspiring--in other words: BLAH!) doesn't give enough information about right and left foot.  There are a lot of turning around moves and I need more instruction when I can't see the TV.  The steps feel so unnatural that once I've turned back around I'm never on the correct foot.  It's really difficult even for an experienced dancer.  (Karen Voight is an EXCELLENT instructor.)

The introduction is very brief and doesn't tell any of the benefits of this workout.  She doesn't give any safety tips or tell you how to get the most out of the exercise.  Why did they bother putting it in?

This video requires MUCH more space than most people have in their living rooms.  If you don't have lots of empty space, don't get this DVD.  Also, they use this little ""The Method Toning Bar"" as a sort of prop at one point in the workout.  I suppose you could use a chair instead--a very tall-backed one--but I just balanced on one leg and was fine.  (I hate it when you have to use their special little props and they don't suggest any alternate equipment.)

I also didn't like the ceaseless drumming.  It's just plain loud.  A little variety in the music would be nice.  And why do they have five people on a crowded-looking set all doing the exact same steps?  It just adds to the confusion.

It's hard to get your heart rate up when you're frustrated with difficult steps and lack of space (which is adequate for most other videos).  I didn't enjoy this workout at all and felt badly that it got such high reviews: thus inspiring my investment.

All in all, I just didn't like this program and will probably not buy any more ""The Method"" DVDs because they get such mixed reviews.  Here I am, throwing my review into the mix for this program.  Hopefully it will help newcomers to ""The Method,"" like me, make a more informed choice.",1102118400,19,2061,4.36578947368421
7883385,5,6305107750,"...who are looking for a challenging step DVD, you've found it!  I love step aerobics & am trying to build my collection of home workout DVDs.  While I love Reebok The Video, I wanted something with more choreography and this DVD delivered!  I'm pretty coordinated and when I used to take step classes, I could easily keep up with instructors who liked to mix up moves rather than stick to basic ones.  However, in all my years stepping, I've never seen instructors try the creative combos found in this DVD - probably b/c everyone, myself included, would've just stood and stared, which was my initial reaction when I tried this DVD today!  However, I liked Lisa Wheeler's cueing, her voice (unlike Denise you know who!), and the combos so much I decided to concentrate and learn the steps this first time.  I won't lie to you, it took me well over an hour just to get through the aerobics routine, b/c I kept having to rewind and redo the combos (and despite all the pausing in my cardio routine, just by relearning the combos over and over, I broke a major sweat!).  I really hate to build, build, then repeat the same steps, so I really loved the structure of this DVD.  You get to do 3 amazing combos, each punctuated by quick but effective thigh/glutes moves, then at the end you get to put all 3 combos together.  I love this format for it makes the time fly and I was having so much fun focusing on the steps that I didn't have time to focus on the burn :)  After the aerobics segment, there's a challenging ab workout that uses Pilates principles and really works your core.  This is one DVD that I know I will not get bored with.",1083456000,17,1639,4.394039735099338
7883386,5,6305107750,I have numerous step videos but this one is by far my favorite.  The moves are difficult since I am a total spaz when it comes to dancing but once you pick them up - it is so much fun - and a fantastic workout.  I workout much  harder to this tape than any other because I don't realize it is a workout  - it's just fun!  It's a fantastic tape to break up the monotony of the  traditional step tapes where they all share the same basic moves.,946166400,3,442,3.9101123595505616
7883387,1,6305107750,"I did not realize that this was, indeed, a step video.  Neither did a friend of mine who was anxious to see it.  The workout is very intricate.  I was an aerobics instructor, trained and certified by Reebok to teach  step.  I had a horrible time trying to keep up with what Lisa was doing.  Plus, one of the best things to me about The Method is the lack of  ""props"".  This video needs your sneakers, a step, a dowel and  alot more coordination than I have!  Very disappointed with this offering.  Would anyone who is a fitness freak be interested in this one-time used  tape?",937353600,17,576,4.330188679245283
