6305497,5,B00IYSU9NI,"A known history of old Hawaii that was reborn. There is alot more to learn that still remains in the Hawaiian islands, such as old navigational sites and the interpretation of names places and mountain tops and forgotten names of our hoku.",1413590400,3,239,4.714285714285714
6305498,5,B00IYSU9NI,"Great video about the Polynesian Navigators that were/are not given credit for there accomplishments well above European navigators in history.  All who are interested in the history of the Pacific Islands, Micronesia Polynesia, and Hawaii,should view it.  Pertinent for today because of the voyage of Hokule'a around the world.",1406332800,3,328,5.673469387755102
6305499,5,B00IYSU9NI,"I met pwo Navigator Ninoa Thompson yesterday in Hilo, Hawaii, as they were preparing Hikianali'i and Hokule'a for their three-year WWV, world-wide voyage, for peace and environment.  The documentary DVD we bought because the Palace Theatre was full for the public showing was excellent. It shows how the ocean-going native canoes on Mau Piailug's Satawal Island are made from scratch by hand with only native materials, and how they navigate by star and swell, using no charts or instruments, and all logged in their heads while at sea. Accurate to within 40 miles (within sight of island mtns.) over a 2,500 mile voyage, Mau found Tahiti in 1976. That's definitely impressive.",1400976000,5,677,5.099099099099099
6305500,4,B00IYSU9NI,"My wife and I greatly enjoyed watching it.  I've owned copies of ""We, the Navigators"" by David Lewis and ""The Last Navigator"" by Steve Thomas for a number of years, so it was really interesting to see and hear Mau Piailug speaking!",1399939200,4,231,4.5
8646571,3,B00IYSU9NI,"This is an introduction to the history of the navigators.  I think there are a few inaccuracies, or at least a few things left out.  I found a better, perhaps more technical, description in a Wikipedia article called ""Polynesian navigation.""  Nevertheless I appreciate that they were making the film for a wide audience.  I don't think they mentioned (I may have dosed off) that they did indeed use instruments to measure the elevation of stars or that sometimes boats were blown off course and had no idea where they were.  I think they said they didn't have charts or ""maps"" but in fact they did have special representations of where the islands were and I would call that a chart.  I got a kick out of the fact that they showed the traditional making of the hulls but the sails were obviously sewn at a modern sail loft.  Worth watching when all is said and done.",1529884800,,866,4.512820512820513

8646577,1,B00IYSU9NI,"This film is not very good.  The film ""Wayfinders: Waves, Winds, and Stars,"" which is shown daily at the Bishop Museum in Honolulu is much, much better and covers all aspects shown in ""Navigators"" to a much better extent.  My most unfavorite part of this film is where the ""natives"" have caught a sea turtle which they plan to eat later.  The poor thing is writhing in pain, gasping for air, while they drag it around.  It not only makes the natives look backward and barbaric, but the treatment of this beautiful sea creature is abhorrent.  I live in Hawaii and frequently swim with the Honu, which is the sea turtle.  They are friendly, bright, and curious animals.  When we are in the water with the they enjoy swimming with us.  ""Well,"" you might say, ""the natives need to eat, too.""  The natives had a whole boatload of fish, and the Honu was considered their ""delicacy.""  They eat dogs in China, but I don't think I would enjoy having my children and I watching a video about the butchering of dogs.  Like dogs, the Honu is an animal that is loved by so many.  I threw my copy of ""Navigators"" in the trash.",1458000000,,1112,4.4236453201970445

8646580,5,B00IYSU9NI,Excellent telling of the rise of Hokle'a & the Pokynesian Voyaging Society. A must watch for anyone interested in preservation of indigenous peoples.,1420675200,2,149,5.521739130434782
