5990945,4,B00FG7XCL6,"It is a very good movie, as an sexploitation movie showing clear, and close up naked women private parts. But it could be better if it did not have that stupid clown, who did not do anything accept stupid talk.",1394841600,9,210,4.275
5990946,1,B00FG7XCL6,"A demented clown who sexually abuses beautiful young captive  women...Sounds marvelously kinky and degenerate, right? What a let-down. While Zebub is a pretty creepy clown, I must admit, what passes for his torture dungeon is surprisingly clean and well-lit, so there is zero atmosphere in this flic, the bondage of his victims is loose and sloppy and they could obviously get up and walk away any time they wanted.  His first victim behaves as if she is the director of the film, with Zebub seeming to be carefully following her orders as to what he can and cannot do to her. The second victim is a better actress, but not much. Lots of female nudity, full-frontal, but no explicit sex. In the hands of a director with more guts and imagination, this premise could be genuinely disturbing, instead of a fast-forward fest...",1393718400,22,824,4.795774647887324
5990947,3,B00FG7XCL6,"Amuse Me is basically a very extended look at two Model Mayhem models in the nude (Jordana Leigh and Lydia Lael) while they're taunted, in an alcove of someone's basement, by a sadistic clown.  So, a fetish live-action photo shoot.

I'll give Bill Zebub credit, he does find some beautiful models to star in his movies.

Production values are actually pretty high.  Video quality is good, lighting fair (fitting the ""basement torture chamber motif), and the sound good for what it is.  The script is obviously largely an ad-lib performance on the part of Bill and the models trying to assume whatever positions and expressions Bill directs them to do (either Bill-as-Clown, or Bill-as-director).

Throughout, there's a mix of heavy metal music and eerie tunes to set the mood.  It does a good job of that, actually, by being disjointed and loud enough to oppress.

Mr. Zebub obviously knows an audience, and caters to them directly (albeit not explicitly, per se) with this film.  The theme is pretty extreme, though there is little direct violence shown (both women*** are dispatched violently, but not bloodily).  The theme's not my cup of tea, but it isn't done realistically or viciously.  It does throw in an odd plot twist as an aside at the end.  There's implied rape (clearly implied with the women's nude bodies), two homicides, and horrible puns delivered with an implied violence.",1393632000,16,1391,4.948275862068965
5990948,3,B00FG7XCL6,"Ok. this movie has alot of nude scenes & alot of nice close-ups involving a few hot girls. The movie does not involve deviant behavior or rape as it clearly says it does. Each time a new woman is supposedly tortured, the clown is shown laying beside the woman in the beginning of each scene. The clown is retarded or something because he says some weird shtuff to the so-called victims who can hardly keep from laughing as they are being tortured. It is unclear what happens to the women after torture although the pretty blonde at the end gets PG-13 screwed by the so-called rapist clown. Again very dissapointing due to the fact you get the impression the woman is being raped but there is no real violence & the woman again doesn't appear too unhappy. This movie is, at it's most sadistic part, is a mere soft-core porn film. It makes you wanna laugh in alot of area of the fiction involved. Thanks",1392854400,13,901,4.466666666666667
