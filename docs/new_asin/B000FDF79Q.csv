8434593,5,B000FDF79Q,I don't know about anyone else but I was very happy that this DVD on karate basics only shows basic techniques. Elsa Au is a multiple time world champion and the reason she has been so successful is that she learned to perfect her basic movements at a very early age. The information in this DVD is vital to anyone who intends to compete at an international level. Just like anything else Karate is built from the base up and who better to learn the basics from than a champion who has learned from a champion and is now coaching future champions. Anyone who has anything negative to say about this DVD has completely missed the point and will truly miss out on this invaluable information.,1218412800,,690,4.484126984126984
8434594,1,B000FDF79Q,"Elissa Au may be a world champion, but this DVD certainly is unprofessional and frankly lame. Some very basic moves are covered (kicks, blocks and punches), in a tiny room where she and her assistant can barely fit three moves in. In addition, the producers didn't bother re-shoot scenes where she misspeaks and corrects herself (""the next move will be .... oh I'm sorry, I mean the next move we'll cover is ...""). It makes the DVD seem like a draft shoot, a home video you might expect on youtube, not a professional DVD that would cost as much as it did. The DVD may be of interest to total beginners - for advanced or intermediate karateka, it's not of much use. Note on my DVD the final chapter did not play as the DVD was defective.",1167868800,7,737,4.386861313868613
