7995756,1,B0000A4G8Z,"Saying this movie was a huge disappointment is an insult to all the other things in my life that were disappointing.  I saw the preview for Rockwell in a movie theater years ago.  It is one of only a very few movies that even touch on the man and his life.  Fascinated and hopeful, I hunted around for the film for a long time, eventually finding it here on Amazon.  I was ecstatic!  Then I pushed the play button.  Oh, the pain, the pain!  In the words of Ross Perot: ""People, this goat just don't buck!""

Anyone who knows anything about the historical Orrin Porter Rockwell can confirm he was a tremendously enigmatic character.  He was, like so many of those old west figures, both a hero and a complete scoundrel.  Which he might have been depends entirely on the context and time you ran into him.  At times he was a lawman; a Deputy US Marshal, and at other times he undoubtedly stepped over the law, very similar in many ways to Wyatt Earp.  He was notorious as a killer, known to be vicious and lethal, much like Wild Bill Hickok, who was a contemporary of Rockwell.

Perhaps more than anything else, he was known for being the personal bodyguard for a period of time to Joseph Smith; founder of the Mormon (LDS) church, and later to Smith's successor, Brigham Young.  Smith gave a prophecy that so long as Rockwell didn't cut his hair, no bullet or knife would ever harm him.  And, despite his rough and tumble life, Rockwell died of natural causes at age 65, unscathed by bullet or blade, as promised.

The man's life was a veritable encyclopedia of fascinating events and stories, a mixture of stranger-than-life truth coupled with a fair dose of myth.  One of his nicknames due to his reputation as a killer with a gun was, ""The Destroying Angel of Mormondom.""  He was accused and held for trial for the attempted, unsuccessful assassination of then Governor of Missouri, Lilburn Boggs; author of Executive Order 44, also known as the infamous ""Mormon Extermination Order"".  Boggs was shot by person or persons unknown, and Rockwell was arrested and held for nearly 9 months pending trial for the crime, though virtually no evidence was ever brought against him.  Rockwell's own words in his defense stated he had ""never shot AT anybody.  If I shoot, they get shot.  And he's still alive, ain't he?""  Given the absence of any evidence, and the fact that based on Rockwell's reputation as a consummate killer, it was unlikely Boggs would have survived if Rockwell had been the one to pull the trigger, he was ultimately released.

With material like this, the possibilities for producing a truly fascinating movie were almost limitless.  But, the pablum its script writers churned out could have been bested by a pack of comatose chimpanzees with nothing but a broken crayon and a roll of toilet paper to work with.  The writers touched on none of the interesting parts of Rockwell's colorful life.  Instead, they spent scene after scene showing him blushing and running away from a hormone-infatuated, 14 year old girl who amorously stalks him throughout the film.  C'mon, guys, did you honestly think depicting Rockwell as being afraid of a school girl with a crush makes for fascinating viewing?  That's like writing a script about the Lincoln assassination and spending most of your time focusing on what hats the men at the theater were all wearing that night.  Such a travesty as this script is punishable by prison sentence in some countries.

The only thing worse than the script itself was the wooden performance of Randy Gleave, who portrayed Rockwell in the picture.  There are 300 million year old tree stumps in Washington State's Petrified Forest that can act more convincingly, and with more feeling and expression than Gleave on his best day.  He is monotone, boring, and seems almost to be reading his lines from a teleprompter, but he's unsure how to pronounce some of the big words.  The horses in the film were better actors than Gleave.  By the end of the movie, he makes you wish Smith had never uttered his prophecy of protection over Rockwell, so that his life might have ended sooner, perhaps thereby cutting this beast of a movie down to something under 10 painful minutes in length.

Rockwell once quipped that, ""I never killed anyone who didn't need killing.""  It is a pity he could not have killed this film.  It is to cinema, what oral herpes are to dental hygiene.  If you should ever chance to run across it at a garage sale, or see it in the .99 cent bin at Walmart, flee in the opposite direction with all possible haste!",1324252800,,4566,4.681304893350063
