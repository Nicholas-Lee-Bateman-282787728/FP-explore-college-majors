6070080,5,B00GBT62S8,"When I ordered this series in Feb 26th, the second season of this show came out on the same day. Every episode on this DVD has very funny plots. This is a good comedy series to check out, if you are a big comedian fan. The second season of this show is currently airing new episodes on Wednesday nights on FXX, FX's sister channel.",1393891200,2,331,4.1875

8622055,2,B00GBT62S8,"Even with stand-up comics as good as Jefferies, TV shows featuring them have a distinct weakness:  they're heavily larded with material you've already seen.  Worse, Jefferies is an outstanding storyteller, and part of how effective he is on stage is how he makes you picture the events of the stories.  Seeing them acted out diminishes them somehow, especially since they needed to be made ""acceptable"" for a cable audience, which further lessened the impact.",1513814400,,459,5.175675675675675

8622059,5,B00GBT62S8,One of the great shows that has gone largely overlooked.  I truly hope a company like Netflix or HULU picks it up for a season 3.  I hope there are others out there who agree.,1467331200,,175,3.9714285714285715

8622061,5,B00GBT62S8,"Very funny show, too bad the morons at Fox moved it to FXX so I couldn't watch it anymore since I don't get that station, then the same genius executives cancelled it when the ratings went down because people had the same issue as me. Hopefully Jim Jefferies will get another show on a better run network.",1428710400,3,305,4.368421052631579
