8751895,2,B01BXHXKXW,"I did not care for this video. I thought it would be a traditional led rosary recitation like in church. I thought there would be a priest or nun reciting the first part and the audience (me) reciting the second part. It was not what I desired at all.
However, the photography is wonderful!!!!",1499040000,4,293,4.444444444444445
8751896,5,B01BXHXKXW,"Very inspirational presentation of the Most Holy Rosary. Captures the heart of prayer in the messages of Our Blessed Mother in Medjugorje. It helps us to meditate on Her messages of Peace, Conversion, and Prayer and is both a beautiful and professionally made video that guides and encourages our prayers at the highest and most spiritual levels.  I also purchased the CD and keep it in the car for praying during daily trips. Please pray the Rosary for the conversion of sinners, for the poor souls in purgatory, for world peace, and especially for the total success of the special plan of Our Blessed Mother.",1461283200,4,610,4.809523809523809
8751897,5,B01BXHXKXW,Reviewed the DVD and it is magnificent with glorious scenery from Medjugorje  while saying the whole rosary.  It is a worthwhile experience viewing the tape as it seems as though you are in Medjugorje.  I highly recommend the DVD and if you can't watch it I would suggest the CD as it would be just as good hearing it as seeing it.,1457049600,6,331,4.306451612903226
