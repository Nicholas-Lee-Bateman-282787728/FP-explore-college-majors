3035993,5,B000YV1L76,"My wife and I both love Tanja's workouts on the Balance Ball. In addition to this DVD we also own the Total Body Toning on the Balance Ball and they are the core (excuse the pun) of our weekly workouts.

The music in both DVDs is very nice to listen to, not just drum machine beats and synthesizers. The outdoor settings are gorgeous.

Tanja is very fun and personable while she explains each move and encourages you throughout the workout. And they truly are FULL BODY workouts that tone you and give you full cardio burn as well.

And the wide variety of exercises on both DVDs means you work a wide variety of muscles and won't get bored out doing one set of exercises over and over. We will definitely be purchasing her third and any future DVD.

The outdoor ""stage"" is a little cheesy of a set-up but gorgeous scenery. I wish they had an exercise-wellness resort they were advertising for! The video provides various levels of difficulty in case you are a beginner- and the instructor's exercises make your muscles burn- great workout!",1392336000,,446,4.451219512195122
3036049,5,B000YV1L76,this video actually had me break a little sweat it doesn't seem like much but it is. I work about 3-5 times a week and I was suprised this vieo made mean sweat. Good price. I am happy with the purchase.,1390435200,,202,3.951219512195122
3036050,5,B000YV1L76,I like that there are 3 separate workouts on this DVD.  And the trainer has a great personality and keeps me going.  The music and scenery are absolutely wonderful.  This is my first experience with a balance ball and it has been a great one.,1381795200,2,242,4.333333333333333
3036051,5,B000YV1L76,"I am new to the balance ball but this video got me hooked!  I actually got so into it on the first session that I overdid it and woke up in the morning with the muscles in my hips and shoulders tight and painful.  I thought maybe some stretching would help (note that I had *not* injured myself, only worked harder than my body was prepared for) so I did the bonus stretch video included on the disk and felt instant relief!  Now anytime that my muscles are tight, I reach for this right away!

As an interesting note, my house has very low ceilings (I can reach up and touch the ceiling in the living room).  I know now that many balance ball workouts don't do well with that.  But this one doesn't expect you to live in a studio (or the beautiful outdoor platforms Tanja and her assistants use)!

Also, the packaging is first rate--a completely biodegradable case of molded cardboard that is just as strong (or stronger) than plastic cases.  It's great to see Giam making these changes!",1378598400,5,988,4.419889502762431

3036071,4,B000YV1L76,"I originally used my exercise ball just for stretching my back out.  I decided to try an exercise dvd to see if I'd like it.  This dvd is doable for a beginner.  Tanja is easy to understand and can explain the exercises.  This is a dvd of slower paced exercises broken up into upper body, core, and lower body sections.  The first time I completed the ab portion I felt like I worked out the next day but only after the first time.  If you are already slightly in shape then you probably won't 'feel the burn' after using this.",1362441600,,527,4.22

3036075,4,B000YV1L76,"I already had another video by the same person. Although she is really demanding, especially with the number of squats, I always feel much better after I do any of her workouts. I would recommend this for anyone who loves using the Pilates exercises with the ball.",1350345600,11,264,4.638297872340425
3036076,4,B000YV1L76,"I really liked this dvd for the work out segements.  I wish (like some other work out dvds) that you could program it to do more than one section at a time instead of it ""ending"" and going back to the main menu.

Great overall exercises.  There is an ""Easy"" and ""hard"" versions for each one.",1328140800,6,291,4.160714285714286
3036077,5,B000YV1L76,This is a low intensity workout but it works. I like to do this on days when I've done weights too many days in a row but still get a good workout.,1321920000,,147,3.625
3036078,3,B000YV1L76,"Some of the exercises in this workout are very good, but some are hard to follow.  Tanja sometimes does not give clear direction, so unless you are facing the tv it is hard to follow her, and while she is counting she does not tell you when to release.  There is also not much focus on posture, so if that is a concern I would not recommend this workout. The workout is also not 60 minutes, as described, each section is a little over 15 minutes with an extra stretching section in the menu, which was also disappointing to me.  For the upper body workout section I am not sure how she was doing some of the moves, such as lifting the ball behind her, because it was painful to do so. I am rather physically fit, but I think her ball must be on the smaller side so use caution if you have a larger one.
Overall, I would probably not buy this tape again even though some of the workout is good.",1312675200,18,893,4.120689655172414
3036089,3,B000YV1L76,You'll need a ball if you order this. I didn't even open the DVD so I don't know anything about the DVD content itself.,1309478400,,119,4.0
3036090,5,B000YV1L76,"I love this video she is my favorite fitness instructor, the video was a great price for a brand new DVD and fast shipping",1301270400,,122,4.125
3036091,4,B000YV1L76,"I've seen reviews on other balance ball workouts where people give low ratings because they are struggling with/hate the ball (not so much the workout.)  I'm glad to see that is not the case with this one.

I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.  I have a few balance ball workouts and this one was quite good.  Workout has 3, 20 minute segments for upper body, lower body, and abs.  I worked up a moderate sweat and felt I got an ok workout.  Instructor is low-key and comfortable with not talking constantly throughout.  Two backup ""dancers"" were non-annoying --- as others noted, instructor refers you to beginner modifications if needed but only a few were modified moves (same move but not going as low or high is not very visible) but I don't use the modifications so it is not a problem for me.

I tend to prefer indoor rather than outdoor routines --- I find the scenery more of a distraction than anything else and this one made me think ""dry, hot"" the whole time but that is a minor con.  Probably would have liked music with a beat or something but little/no music is better than bad music.

Probably best for beginner/intermediates.  A few moves were tough but the majority were not very difficult.  Not really cardio for me but as far as balance ball workouts go, this was good.",1300406400,17,1307,4.538461538461538
3036092,5,B000YV1L76,"I'm new to using a Balance Ball for exercise so I was looking for a video that didn't have a rushed feeling and with an instructor that wasn't aggravating to watch over and over and who explained things very clearly so I knew just what I was supposed to do. This one fit the bill in every way. Plus, at least for me, it was a solid workout and I was feeling it for days after. I'd definitely recommend this to any newbie at Balance Ball workouts.",1300320000,4,446,4.137931034482759
3036093,5,B000YV1L76,"I workout 4-5 days a week. I typically run/sprint and use workout dvds (Crunch fitness Pilates, Jilian Michael's). This dvd has definitely made it's way into my rotation. The only thing I wish is that you could customize the workouts. It is split into 3 separate workouts: Upper body, Lower body, and Abs/Core. I'd like to tell the dvd that I want it to play all 3 workouts one right after the other. Instead, I have to go back to the main menu and choose the next workout. It's a small complaint, but it would be more convenient. Besides that, I find Tanja to be a good trainer...I get annoyed with the trainers that talk to much and tell me how beautiful I look. She gives good direction and cues.",1299024000,5,699,4.384615384615385
3036094,5,B000YV1L76,"Tanja has the ability to make the viewer feel part of the process.  Her segments are well sequenced and fun.  One of the few DVD's with instruction and a trainer that talks directly to viewer while doing the routines.  Most DVD's offer a presenter of technique with a voice over and no instruction or information as to what you are to do, why you are to do it, or the benefit of doing it, and most of all what the contraindications are.  Tanja's DVD's are well rounded.  If a beginner, use a smaller ball for ball in the hands routines then progress to regular ball; if not sure, stop the DVD and try the move until it is comfortable before continuing with Tanja. Do the repetitions at your own pace.  Go at your own pace until you are comfortable. Tanja's enthusiasm for teaching is contagious. Being a fitness instructor with a Master's in psychology she would also remind you, if an exercise doesn't feel appropriate for your body due to medical conditions avoid doing it. Do what you can. Progress not perfection.  I love Tanja's work and use the DVD's that are most suited for me.",1279411200,16,1085,4.505102040816326

The outdoor ""stage"" is a little cheesy of a set-up but gorgeous scenery. I wish they had an exercise-wellness resort they were advertising for! The video provides various levels of difficulty in case you are a beginner- and the instructor's exercises make your muscles burn- great workout!",1392336000,,446,4.451219512195122
3270546,5,B000YV1L76,this video actually had me break a little sweat it doesn't seem like much but it is. I work about 3-5 times a week and I was suprised this vieo made mean sweat. Good price. I am happy with the purchase.,1390435200,,202,3.951219512195122
3270547,5,B000YV1L76,I like that there are 3 separate workouts on this DVD.  And the trainer has a great personality and keeps me going.  The music and scenery are absolutely wonderful.  This is my first experience with a balance ball and it has been a great one.,1381795200,2,242,4.333333333333333
3270548,5,B000YV1L76,"I am new to the balance ball but this video got me hooked!  I actually got so into it on the first session that I overdid it and woke up in the morning with the muscles in my hips and shoulders tight and painful.  I thought maybe some stretching would help (note that I had *not* injured myself, only worked harder than my body was prepared for) so I did the bonus stretch video included on the disk and felt instant relief!  Now anytime that my muscles are tight, I reach for this right away!

As an interesting note, my house has very low ceilings (I can reach up and touch the ceiling in the living room).  I know now that many balance ball workouts don't do well with that.  But this one doesn't expect you to live in a studio (or the beautiful outdoor platforms Tanja and her assistants use)!

Also, the packaging is first rate--a completely biodegradable case of molded cardboard that is just as strong (or stronger) than plastic cases.  It's great to see Giam making these changes!",1378598400,5,988,4.419889502762431

Tanja is easy to understand and can explain the exercises.  This is a dvd of slower paced exercises broken up into upper body, core, and lower body sections.  The first time I completed the ab portion I felt like I worked out the next day but only after the first time.

3270575,3,B000YV1L76,"Some of the exercises in this workout are very good, but some are hard to follow.  Tanja sometimes does not give clear direction, so unless you are facing the tv it is hard to follow her, and while she is counting she does not tell you when to release.  There is also not much focus on posture, so if that is a concern I would not recommend this workout. The workout is also not 60 minutes, as described, each section is a little over 15 minutes with an extra stretching section in the menu, which was also disappointing to me.  For the upper body workout section I am not sure how she was doing some of the moves, such as lifting the ball behind her, because it was painful to do so. I am rather physically fit, but I think her ball must be on the smaller side so use caution if you have a larger one.
Overall, I would probably not buy this tape again even though some of the workout is good.",1312675200,18,893,4.120689655172414

3270588,4,B000YV1L76,"I've seen reviews on other balance ball workouts where people give low ratings because they are struggling with/hate the ball (not so much the workout.)  I'm glad to see that is not the case with this one.

I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.  I have a few balance ball workouts and this one was quite good.  Workout has 3, 20 minute segments for upper body, lower body, and abs.  I worked up a moderate sweat and felt I got an ok workout.  Instructor is low-key and comfortable with not talking constantly throughout.  Two backup ""dancers"" were non-annoying --- as others noted, instructor refers you to beginner modifications if needed but only a few were modified moves (same move but not going as low or high is not very visible) but I don't use the modifications so it is not a problem for me.

I tend to prefer indoor rather than outdoor routines --- I find the scenery more of a distraction than anything else and this one made me think ""dry, hot"" the whole time but that is a minor con.  Probably would have liked music with a beat or something but little/no music is better than bad music.

Probably best for beginner/intermediates.  A few moves were tough but the majority were not very difficult.  Not really cardio for me but as far as balance ball workouts go, this was good.",1300406400,17,1307,4.538461538461538

The only thing I wish is that you could customize the workouts. It is split into 3 separate workouts: Upper body, Lower body, and Abs/Core. I'd like to tell the dvd that I want it to play all 3 workouts one right after the other. Instead, I have to go back to the main menu and choose the next workout. It's a small complaint, but it would be more convenient. Besides that, I find Tanja to be a good trainer...I get annoyed with the trainers that talk to much and tell me how beautiful I look.

3270591,5,B000YV1L76,"Tanja has the ability to make the viewer feel part of the process.  Her segments are well sequenced and fun.  One of the few DVD's with instruction and a trainer that talks directly to viewer while doing the routines.  Most DVD's offer a presenter of technique with a voice over and no instruction or information as to what you are to do, why you are to do it, or the benefit of doing it, and most of all what the contraindications are.  Tanja's DVD's are well rounded.  If a beginner, use a smaller ball for ball in the hands routines then progress to regular ball; if not sure, stop the DVD and try the move until it is comfortable before continuing with Tanja. Do the repetitions at your own pace.  Go at your own pace until you are comfortable. Tanja's enthusiasm for teaching is contagious. Being a fitness instructor with a Master's in psychology she would also remind you, if an exercise doesn't feel appropriate for your body due to medical conditions avoid doing it. Do what you can. Progress not perfection.  I love Tanja's work and use the DVD's that are most suited for me.",1279411200,16,1085,4.505102040816326
