3691878,4,B001LXIDTA,Typical humour that you can only get from someone from britain. The Adventures of Wallace & Grommit is really a very skillful and insightful use of animation and puppetry. Add to that typical British humour and you have a great piece of entertainment.,1356048000,,251,4.8604651162790695
3691879,4,B001LXIDTA,"Far superior to the trash, blood and gore, and fowl language that is on television.  Have all of the Wallace & Gromit movies and enjoy them immensely.  With our collection of DVDs I am considering getting rid of the cable!",1301788800,,222,4.525
3691880,5,B001LXIDTA,"I don't have children, so was rather unaware of W&G for way too long. However, having finally been introduced, I'm an absolute fan.  The claymation is unbelievably smooth & detailed, and much better in many ways than CG.

I've caught up with all the W&G material, but I think this is my favorite...the chase scene at the end had me laughing so hard I literally fell off the couch. It's amazing how communicative Gromit is...despite being mute & having no mouth. The films are jammed full of details that raise them to genius...like when the penguin puts on the glove ""rooster comb,"" he doesn't just don it, he smoothes his flipper over it in a little preen & the fingers boing back upright.

Descriptions fail me as to how funny Wallace & Gromit's films are; I highly recommend them to everyone of any age.",1275264000,,806,4.583333333333333
3691881,5,B001LXIDTA,Brilliant story. I bought Wrong Trousers for my 3 years old daughter. She usually laughs when watching other cartoons but not as much as when she watches this one. What I like about Wrong Trousers is it makes her think and she would ask me many thoughtful questions about characters.,1265328000,,283,4.68
3691882,5,B001LXIDTA,"This has got to be one of my favorites of all time. Not only are the characters well-formed and interesting but in a very short video you get to know their personalities and see them thru trials and tribulations with lots of laughs thrown in, too. The chase scene should not be missed. It's got to rival the best of Hollywood!",1244419200,2,326,4.360655737704918
3691883,5,B001LXIDTA,this is the film that first interested me in this duo. still an impressive work for claymation. blows away the concept started by mr. bill and gumby/pokey. plus the british humor can cross all oceans.,1240272000,,200,4.742857142857143
3691884,5,B001LXIDTA,"My 2 1/2 son recently started watching Wallace and Gromit and loves the trio of shows and the were-rabbit movie, too!",1234483200,3,117,4.619047619047619
3691895,5,B001LXIDTA,"I'm glad I got to share this with my kids, it's a great movie!",1437696000,,62,3.5
3691896,3,B001LXIDTA,My grand kids always like to watch Wallace & Gromit movies. Gromit has that English feel of wit and sarcasm without uttering a word. It's a funny yin & yang to Wallace's simpleton escapades. The turn and point of laughter is found in Gromit's eyes as he shows us how he feels about every position he's put in. It's funny even after seeing it all these times and I have three grand kids.,1432857600,,386,4.301369863013699
3691897,5,B001LXIDTA,"As a Speech Language Therapist, this is a great way to teach social language skills to middle school children with exceptional needs. Michelle Garcia suggests it in her book, ""Thinking about You Thinking about Me,"" with good reason. There is very little talking and the expressions of the characters and villainous penguin are delightful. The poor dog Gromit once again is one step ahead of his less enlightened owner. This will appeal to children and adults alike. It is easy to follow and hilarious to boot.",1420070400,,509,4.930232558139535
3691898,5,B001LXIDTA,We have played this over and over...great claymation movie.,1419465600,,59,5.666666666666667
3691899,5,B001LXIDTA,Is for a gift for the grandson -- anything Wallace and Gromit is the bomb!,1414713600,,74,4.0

3691901,5,B001LXIDTA,We can watch this over and over.  So clever.,1410998400,,44,3.888888888888889
3691902,5,B001LXIDTA,"Wallace & Gromit's The Wrong Trousers is a true giggle.  Mechanical trousers cause a malfunction that Gromit must remedy while Wallace is still wearing them.  What a laugh!

The animation is first rate and voices absolutely critical to the character.  Kudos!",1405728000,,258,5.219512195121951
3691903,5,B001LXIDTA,"Classic Wallace and Gromit. I am a teacher and if my kids earn a special day, the Wallace and Gromit shorts are the best! I can get in a lesson, and still ParTay! The students (middle school) are mostly unfamiliar with Wallace and Gromit, and are intrigued by the art of claymation.",1402876800,,282,4.4423076923076925
3691904,5,B001LXIDTA,Very funny movie.  Wished it were a bit longer.  Love Wallace & Gromit.  fun for whole family.  fun to watch.,1402704000,,109,4.3
3691925,5,B001LXIDTA,Wallace & Gromit have such fun adventures in all their movies.  My husband & I were introduced to them while living in the U.K and couldn't be happier.  Got these shows as a gift to my husband as I finally found them in DVD format.  He will be so surprised.,1397779200,,257,4.1
3691926,5,B001LXIDTA,There's nothing like Wallace and Gromit at our house. Clean and fun and funny. We put it on and the house goes quiet.,1396396800,,117,4.130434782608695
3691927,3,B001LXIDTA,"It was cute but not as funny as other W&G movies I've seen. However, it was still fun to watch.",1394841600,,95,3.8
3691928,5,B001LXIDTA,"Wallace and Gromit are very entertaining.  This is one of the classics!

Would love to see some new episodes.

Would recommend it to all!",1394064000,,137,4.625
3691929,5,B001LXIDTA,"So much to enjoy for adults and children alike.  It takes an artiste to give characters such emotion, especially from a dog that doesn't speak and doesn't even have a mouth!  Nick park hits a homerun again.",1388793600,,206,4.54054054054054
3691930,5,B001LXIDTA,"My wife and I have always enjoyed Wallace and Gromit. Now our grandson is a big fan.  It works at all levels,",1387929600,,109,3.9545454545454546
3691931,2,B001LXIDTA,"Was advertised to be 50 min. long. It was if you counted the special features garbage. My 5y/o could care less about the behind the scenes workings. In reality the ""movie"" was only about 20 mins. Was a total rip off and I will not be buying any ""Wallace and Grommit"" movies ever again.",1360108800,,285,4.296296296296297
3691932,3,B001LXIDTA,Movie was ok. Not as good as some of the others in the series. Son lost interest pretty quick on this one.,1359936000,,106,3.8636363636363638
3691933,3,B001LXIDTA,"It took our 3 year old and 5 year old a little while to get into this movie. I was concerned at first as to whether it was a good purchase. Then all of a sudden, they were actually watching it.",1356998400,,193,3.731707317073171
3691934,5,B001LXIDTA,"The claymation is remarkable. Yes, you MUST see it. BUT, the COMEDY is a TREASURE and off the charts FUNNY. WALLACE is an inventor and he invents a pair of MECHANICAL PANTS to put on his dog, GROMIT, so he no longer has to take his dog for a walk (the pants will do it for him). That's funny enough. BUT WAIT. FEATHERS, the penguin, steals the pants to scale a wall to do a diamond robbery. UNIMAGINABLY HILARIOUS!!!. I was really glad to see every one else who left a review thinks so, as well. YOU MUST SEE THIS. YES, AN ABSOLUTE TREASURE. SO VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
Don't make the mistake of thinking, because this is a cartoon, it is for children, only. Kids will like it, but  it is, absolutely, for adults, as well.
A 1993 ACADEMY AWARD WINNER.",1356998400,,751,4.326241134751773

8320146,5,B001LXIDTA,"Too bad I can only give this 5 stars...You can't beat claymation when it comes to Wallace & Grommet!  The zenith and standard in the world of claymation.  So if you love claymation as I do, you won't be disappointed with Wallace & Grommet!",1485388800,,239,4.409090909090909
