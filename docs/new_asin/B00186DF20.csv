8268524,1,B00186DF20,"Alexi is amazing, but this video is BAD. No explanation or anything- it's basically ""Hi. Here's riff 1 slow, now fast, now with backing track. Here's riff 2..."" I got to the section on how to sing and play guitar at the same time and thought here will be some helpful info. But no, his super helpful advice to help you is just ""It wasn't really ever hard for me to do both at the same time."" Wow, thanks, that really helps. Also, the camera angles aren't great and it's hard to see what frets and strings he's playing. I'm sorry to say, there are MUCH better videos out there for learning guitar.",1418515200,2,596,4.283185840707965
8268525,3,B00186DF20,"Although Alexi may play very good, the DVD lacks depth into his style, notes, reasons of composition and what he is doing.... if you just wanna copy and really know nothing else.... this is it....each song is just a sampling 2 - 3 tabs most on a smallest scale of his songs......I'm glad he paid a bunch for making this DVD....he seems a bit nervous most of the time in his demonstrations of techniques etc..... this DVD is just a hook to get you to sign up online for their onile guitar bass, drums, vocal programs.  Other than that its kinda nice to see his guitars and how he dresses usually.",1369267200,,595,4.36036036036036
8268526,2,B00186DF20,"I didn't recieve the book that is to go along with the dvd, but I was still able to figure out most of the information. I own the beginner rock guitar course with John McCarthy and the two lessons that follow. This lesson doesnt even compair to the Beginner rock guitar dvd. Even though it is not heavy metal guitar, he still teaches you everything you could learn from this dvd, plus much more. You could learn something from this but I would advise to go with the other one I mentioned. Good luck",1268352000,,498,4.308510638297872
8268527,5,B00186DF20,"This is a Great DVD. I feel that a couple other reviews are a little negative, especially the one where the guy says, ""it seems like you get the feeling Alexi doesn't really want to be there,"" is very negative. He doesn't seem that way at all. He just seems like he's just kickin' it, giving a really cool personal guitar lesson. One guys review says yada, yada, yada and ect. ect. ect. It's perfectly fine!!!
Now, it does say ""Level 1,"" Implying that it's a beginners dvd. THIS IS NOT A ""BEGINNERS"" DVD, although you CAN slow it down to see what he's doing; which many people will have to do anyway. He does play it fairly slow and does give tabs right after each thing he does. The difference between beginners and intermediate & Advanced is how ""Fast"" one can play, so YOU can slow this stuff down and learn one string on one fret at a time, learn a part of it and keep practicing that over and over and over until you get faster and faster and faster.
A GREAT quote unquote ""Beginners"" DVD is the House of Blues Metal Guitar. You can actually learn how to play guitar JUST from watching THAT. This is good to learn many things such as, new arpeggios, which is, not strumming but, going from one note to the next, Eddie Van Halen style OR after you watch this DVD....Alexi Style!!!

8268528,3,B00186DF20,As far as an intro to metal guitar the information shared is very good but it is all covered briefly in a very production line style manner. It seems like all of Alexis parts were done in one take and you almost get the feeling he doesnt really want to be there. His section on singing & playing at the same time is priceless. So production wise its pretty bodgy but who cares when the technique your after is all there. Worth a look.,1233964800,2,434,4.178571428571429
8268529,5,B00186DF20,"for me, alexi is the best guitar god nowadays. learning from him on this DVD are the best thing. i love the way he use alternate picking. but, the disappoint, thare are no songs to learn from first three albums.
Alexi is not ego maniac. he willing to share his skills, powerful licks and heavy riffs.",1224028800,,300,4.375
8268530,5,B00186DF20,"I got this DVD figuring it would be cool too learn some COB tunes...it turned out to be a metal boot camp.  I like the hands on approach, along with the fact that each section is straight forward, and the support site has some handy tips too.",1221955200,3,242,4.148936170212766
