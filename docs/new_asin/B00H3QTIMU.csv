8629543,3,B00H3QTIMU,"My Level 4 French class and I watched this film after having read the novel.  We liked it; we did not love it.  The young man playing Philippe never changed his facial expression once during the entire film. He pouted and pouted and pouted.  While that is understandable at the beginning of the film, it did not make much sense throughout the rest of the film.  The few intimate scenes left more to the imagination than they were acted out; Hemingway did a better job of that in his novels.  The explosive scene between Philippe and Vinca at the end was reasonably well done, but the novel suggested a cozier place among the cliffs than where they were; it was not a comfortable nestling site.  Camille Dalleray never changed her expressions either, but she remained the mysterious woman/teacher.  I guess we found the acting lacking; people rather floated through the film; there was nothing we could grasp, save perhaps the young girl who played the role of Lisette, the most honest interpretation of a child in the film.  She provided a striking and relieving contrast to everything else which was occurring. Vinca was pretty, almost the spitting image of the novel's character, but her pouting matched that of Philippe.  Someone told me an earlier edition of the film was terrific; I'll give that one a try next time.",1400112000,2,1321,4.758771929824562
