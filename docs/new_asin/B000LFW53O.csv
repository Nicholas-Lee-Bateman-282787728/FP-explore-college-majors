8161897,2,B000LFW53O,"The good thing about this video is that it is quite comprehensive...to a fault!  It is an hour-and-a-half long and seems much longer.  More about the history of churches and castles than anyone would ever want.  The main fault is that much of the footage looks very old and is of poor quality.  The narrator has a Portuguese accent, not necessarily bad except many of the words are incomprehensible to an English speaking audience.  Finally, there is nothing about Fado, the music, or where to hear it.  I've seen other videos on Lisbon that have made me want to go; this one makes it a trip to avoid!",1505433600,,601,4.518518518518518
