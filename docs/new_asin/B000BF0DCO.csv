Film tastes certainly change, and it is interesting in retrospect which that are in this set seem now not so important as when it was released. A must for film students that could open a lot of interesting discussions.",1364428800,7,298,4.75
8085835,5,B000BF0DCO,"I had so hoped that I would be able to watch these movies in spite of being in a different code region in the world. USA is 1, Japan is 2. I was wrong, and could not see them all without serious problems (that I knew would arise if I was not able to play them).

I did get to see two on my desktop through a video play V-Lan that is supposed to have all codecs, but after two videos, I could no longer get the others to play.

I still hope that one day I will find a video software that allows me to see any region movie. It is frustrating that regions block our opportunities to see classic works from around the world.

Five stars because I KNOW Sundance produces very high quality work.",1262217600,10,689,4.014598540145985
