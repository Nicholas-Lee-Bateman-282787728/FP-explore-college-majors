8568797,5,B003NE666M,"This movie is fantastic! It was obviously shot on an ultra low budget, but it's full of campy fun in they vein of the Toxic Avenger. In short, it's hilarious! The filmmakers effortlessly spoof such classic horror films like the Halloween series as well as films from all types of genres. I laughed the whole way through, definitely worth watching! I look forward to seeing more films by the production team!",1412121600,,407,4.746478873239437
