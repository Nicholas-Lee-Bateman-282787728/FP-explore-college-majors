8500483,5,B006LQXXGU,"I  really liked this film as the kids talked about their moms and the era from their
viewpoint.  I would recommend this film to  anyone who wants to learn more
about the revolutionary era of the 60's and 70's  It gives a very strong insight.
I support the cause but not the violent means they used..

I'm surprised that the daughter of Meinhof accepted the suicide of her mother in prison.  Knowing that her mother loved writing she definitely would have left a suicide note if she was going to  commit suicide.  Also the suicidie's by
gun is a prison by Meinhofs comrades is very suspicious.",1355097600,4,592,4.518867924528302

""Children of the Revolution"" is a documentary by Irish filmmaker Shane O'Sullivan that captures the history of late 1960s and 1970s politics through the eyes of the daughters of revolutionary leaders Ulrike Meinhof, of the Baader Meinhof Group, and Fusako Shigenobu of the Japanese Red Army.

The documentary includes an excellent selection of archival footage from the era and follows the extraordinary lives of Bettina Rohl and May Shigenobu...daughters of the revolution, both of whom are now journalists.

The film is both entertaining and educational and brings some sense to the motivation, emotion, belief and determination of two women who in their own way shaped the world.

If you like this film, please also check out O'Sulllivan's excellent ""RFK Must Die,"" a superb investigative account of the assassination of Robert Kennedy.
