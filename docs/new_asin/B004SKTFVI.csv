She is worth watching all the time every night.",1384560000,,97,3.9
4463941,5,B004SKTFVI,"Elvira's commentary vastly improved the Dracula film and made the Werewolf film inspired.  Her take on Washington politics with her character ""Sarah Impalin"" is the best part of the set..I laughed, I cried, I can see Transylvania from here.  A must have for Elvira fans.. of course, the movies are pretty bad, but Elvira makes them watchable.",1320451200,4,342,4.982456140350878
4463942,2,B004SKTFVI,The movies on this DVD are not uncut and are edited for television.  Prior Elvira DVDs had uncut versions of the movies so I was disapointed by the versions of the films on here.  The segments by Elvira are still funny and entertaining however.,1315785600,11,244,4.5227272727272725
4463943,5,B004SKTFVI,"Elvira make these, um, ""classic"" films worth watching! She's hilarious- can't wait for more! I hope she releases: Giant Gila Monster, Don't Look in the Basement, Lady Frankenstein, Jesse James Meets Frankenstein's Daughter, Bucket of Blood, and of course the Halloween and Christmas episodes!",1308614400,5,292,5.659090909090909
4463944,5,B004SKTFVI,Elvira has been on TV for a long time and that's because she has a legion of really dedicated fans. The movies are stinkers but that's okay because we endure them with Elvira and she rips them to bits with her razor sharp wit. With her as your guide it's fun to sit through cheesy monster flicks from the 40s to the 70s.,1307404800,7,320,4.095238095238095
4463945,5,B004SKTFVI,"To be honest, ""The satanic rites of Dracula"" pretty much sucks.....and I don't mean in a vampire kind of way.
But Elvira makes the unwatchable, watchable, and the experience of watching the movie with her is a fun, enjoyable one.

The real gem here, is ""The Werewolf Of Washington"". It was featured on the OLD Movie Macabre series, but this NEW Movie Macabre series' version is much better and funnier!

 The movie has some charm to it....it had me howling at the moon and licking my.......lips, at the sight of the beautiful Elvira, and she comes up with great jokes during the movie.

 Elvira For President!

 Now THAT is one campaign I'd love to get behind!

 Donald Trump? His hair should be the subject of a horror film...""The Hair That Wouldnt Move"".

 President Obama?  He promised change. He gave us the S.O.S.

 President Elvira? Oh, yeah, baby, I would gladly flip my lever in the voting booth on her behalf!

 Her ""twins"" would make Bush and Cheney look like Larry and Curly.

 Men everywhere would be saluting Elvira on Erec....um,I mean ELECTION Day!

 She would put the sense of humor back into America.

  These two movies, one with a Werewolf, one with a Vampire, will make you howl and bite with laughter and will quench your thirst for the macabre.

  Elvira spices up these movies and makes them fun..",1303948800,13,1320,4.655021834061135
