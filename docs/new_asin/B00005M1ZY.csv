This Alpha release is in Letterbox,glorious Widescreen and beautiful color

1623697,5,B00005M1ZY,"One of my fondest childhood memories was camping out in front of our big color TV on Saturday mornings watching an endless stream of Italian muscle man ""sword and sandal"" movies. They were colorful, fun and very juvenile. My father, who held a prominent place in the community, referred to these features as ""wop movies."" In all innocence, I commented loudly to my dad in a supermarket one time ""let's go home and watch some wop movies!"" I was incredulously shushed up, for reasons that were unknown to me at the time.
Something Weird has coughed up a winner with this fun double feature. GOLIATH AND THE DRAGON is typical ""peplum."" An arrogant muscleman hero must do battle with an evil dictator (this time, Broderick Crawford dubbed in with not his real voice!) while his effete male companion and his lovely wife get constantly underfoot. It's big (letterboxed), colorful and will be manna from heaven for those who adore the cheesy monsters found in these films. There's a knee-jerk three-headed Cerebus dog (that looks like it's suffering from cerebral palsy), a centaur that turns into a satyr to solve the problematical nature of two to four horse hooves and of course, the dragon. Really, there's no reason not to buy this disc, crammed full of colorful extras. Put this on and relive your Saturday afternoons of yore.",1019001600,10,1326,4.845814977973569
1623698,5,B00005M1ZY,"First of all, let me say that Goliath and the Dragon is my favorite sword and sandal movie of all time. Mark Forest is perfectly cast as Goliath and the DVD format is absolutely incredible. Last year I bought a VHS format of this movie from Hollywood Attic and the quality was abysmal. They also hacked the movie to death cutting out key parts from beginning to end. The quality of this DVD is amazing and it looks to be completely intact. My mother took me to see this movie when I was a wee lad of 6 years old and I must admit I love watching this movie now every bit as much as I did then. If your a fan of this genre, this is a MUST BUY for your collection.",1015286400,11,661,3.9774436090225564
1623703,1,B00005M1ZY,"I recently purchased ""Goliath and the Dragon"" to add to my Peplum/Sword & Sandal collection and was disappointed to find it was a DVD-R. Apparently the older versions were pressed discs but recently Something Weird Video switched to DVD-Rs. It is not listed in the details listing on amazon and I would not have purchased for the price if I would have known beforehand. Might be worth it for $5.99 but $14.98 for a DVD-R...

1623714,4,B00005M1ZY,"Another sword and sandal film that follows in the footsteps of Hercules. A muscle bound Goliath is out rescuing ladies, slaying some interesting creatures and saving the day. I'd give it a 7 out of 10. Better than some of the Hercules and Sinbad films I've seen but not the best. Perfect for a Saturday afternoon with the kids.",1352505600,,327,4.559322033898305
1623715,5,B00005M1ZY,"If you're a fan of the Italian ""Sword and Sandal"" genre, then you probably agree with the opinion that GOLIATH AND THE DRAGON (1960), is one of the most representative of this brand of films. It packs in all the standard plot elements - a beefcake hero, beautiful maidens, palace intrigue, mythical monsters, and a wicked monarch - but to a degree that surpasses most of the other installments. The production even includes a bit of stop-motion animation for the dragon of the title. It also benefits by some unintentional humor brought on in part through the English dubbing.

Mark Forest carved a niche for himself with muscleman movies, and he does a good job here as the hero, Goliath. But the one who's  the most fun to watch chew up every scene he's in is Broderick Crawford as the evil King Eurysteus. He's an all around nasty villain with a big scar on his face, who likes tossing his enemies into a snake pit.

This version from Something Weird Video is off the 35mm U.S. ""Colorscope"" negative,
and is presented in widescreen. Also included is a bonus feature, THE CONQUEROR OF ATLANTIS (1965), a sci-fi/sword and sandal tale that's actually pretty good too.

As is customary with  Something Weird, the special features are lots of fun; you get a cache of trailers, 3 short subjects, and a gallery of Sword and Sandal Exploitation Art.

You really can't go wrong with this great looking, entertaining DVD, and I highly recommend it.",1320278400,6,1441,4.721115537848606
1623716,5,B00005M1ZY,this was my favorite movie when i was young. i was so delighted to be able to get it now and watch it again. still fun to watch.,1317859200,,128,3.607142857142857
1623717,4,B00005M1ZY,"This one starts out with Mark Forest climbing down a cliff using the power of his steely, bulgey, mighty thews. Due to the camera angle and the tiny fir micro-skirt he's wearing, you almost kind of get a glimpse of the pillar of Hercules, if you get my drift. Only Forest isn't playing Hercules here. He's playing Emilius the Mighty, nicknamed Goliath and gifted by the gods with strength and immortality in return for his devotion. He's sort of their errand boy. His job here is to take out a giant, 3 headed, fire breathing dog. I suppose you can't just smack a dog like that on the snout with a rolled up newspaper or squirt him with a water bottle so Herc, I mean Goliath, I mean Emilius the Mighty decides to lay a beat down on it.

  The problem is that the dog is so wretchedly made that you end up feeling sorry for it because instead of looking like a terrifying horror it just looks really woozy. When ""Goliath"" finally stabs it in the throat with what looks like a butter knife the dog stops bobbing it's heads and then tips over. It's unclear whether the thing died or just fell asleep. Either way it's out of the picture and Goliath moves on to his next task, to capture a jewel, which is held by a hideous bat-monster, which looks like a very big raisinette with wings. This monster makes the gods quake in their sandals but Goliath just stabs it with his butter knife and it dies like a beeyotch. He brings the jewel to the temple of the gods and a priestess informs him that his service to the gods is now over and he can do his own thing.

  All he wants to do after years of service is go back to his home and live with his family. which makes him like Maximus from Gladiator, except that instead of defeating his nation's greatest enemies, bringing and end to decades of war and securing his country's northern border, Goliath killed a woozy dog and a raisinette.

I'm not sure what the exact plot is after this scene because I was doing laundry in my small apartment while watching this and the noise from the washing machine made it difficult to hear everything that was said. But some kinds of shenanigans were afoot because the really hot, busty non-blond (red-head in this case) and the ugly dudes were giving each other shifty looks. Then a really sneaky looking ugly dude who also wore eye-shadow, making him effeminate and therefore extra decadent & untrustworthy, handed a vial of something to the red-head, which at first I thought, because of her constantly heaving chest, might have been medicine for palpitations of some kind, but as it turned out, it was poison for Goliath.

Goliath spends alot of time throwing pig roasts and talking about how great it is to live a simple life with his friends and family. His brother, Illus, wants to marry a girl from a rival and evil clan. This upsets Goliath so much that when Illus tries to leave the pig roast to see the girl, Goliath ties him to a tree, figuring he'll come to his senses eventually. So he's a little more Great Santini than he is Cliff Huxtable.

Then there are more sly looks between the bad guys and then a girl rides up to Ilus on a horse and slips him the poison. She thinks it is a potion that will clear Goliath's mind so he will allow Ilus to marry his girl.

Goliath releases Ilus after Ilus cries ""Uncle"" and Ilus slips him the mickey. Now I did miss some of what happened next because I was throwing in some fabric softener, but I think Goliath goes a bit wonky and almost dies, but then he doesn't. Then he kills a vicious cardboard dragon, and then you're done.

This movie is a solid example of what makes a good peplum. It has plenty of cheesy FX, over-the-top battle scenes and lots of inadvertent humor.",1293753600,,3712,4.396501457725948
1623718,2,B00005M1ZY,"not enought good looking monsters-cheap, fake, short; i like the falling tree, story just barely ok. y cus's rated this so high was wrong-made me buy it but luckily for 2.6 dvd new wasn't too bad but shipping is mostly higher than the show which some of this $ always goes to show costs.",1239235200,,287,4.333333333333333
1623719,5,B00005M1ZY,"During the sixties, Italian cinema exported literally hundreds of movies each year that primarily consisted of 1) Spaghetti Westerns, 2) Italian gialli, and 3) sword and sandal features known as pepla.  ""Goliath and the Dragon"" is a prime example of a peplum.  Something Weird Video, a subsidiary of Image, has done an excellent job of restoring this feature, which was released in 1960 and stars bodybuilder Mark Forest, known as ""the Adonis with the perfect physique.""  This DVD has a boatload of sword and sandal extras, including an un-restored, full frame feature of ""Conqueror of Atlantis.""

  Forest was every bit as good an actor as his contemporaries, including icon Steve Reeves.  Unfortunately, Forest left acting to further his career as an opera singer and never obtained the stardom that Reeves enjoyed.  Money he earned from his acting went towards his education.  Mark Forest is a good man.  He spent his early life helping to devise rehabilitation programs for the elderly.

  ""Goliath and the Dragon"" has a lot of action/adventure.  Goliath must battle strange creatures, he is plotted against by an evil king, and he rescues his captive brother and wife from deadly traps.  A large cast and budget make this movie a must have for fans of Italian sword and sandal.  I can only hope that Image, Retromedia, and other companies will release more restored, widescreen versions of pepla, especially the ones that star Mark Forest.",1212796800,7,1444,5.055084745762712
1623720,5,B00005M1ZY,"Muscles, monsters, emperor's, and evil dictators. . . what more can you possibly want from a good Saturday afternoon dvd sword & sandel movie!
This dvd has extras galore, and nice to have other options than just one movie, or the same movie's trailers, and whatever. This dvd has many well muscled faces in various heroes, and trailers for many other features. The Conquerer Of Atlantis was a surprise added movie included on this dvd, and believe it or not, better than Goliath And The Dragon as far as bringing back the tension of early cinema serials involving the likes of Flash Gordon. It actually had me watching until the end, since the hero fought evil henchmen, to help his comrades to escape, leaving himself behind in the evil empire's mercy. The comrades make their way back to their own army and band together to retrieve the lost hero. Even though in the back of your mind, you know how it's going to end, you just have to watch. Some elements of the best Sci-fi thrillers intact, even in this cheapie. Very good, and worth the money for this ""total package.""",1184716800,5,1073,4.62303664921466
1623721,2,B00005M1ZY,"Hmmm... Can't say as I agree with my fellow reviewers here, but the movie deserves points for the sheer nerve of delivering a wonderful poster...then cheating its audience of such an experience. Looks as if the color and widescreen were stunning when this was shot, but despite the comments below, this print looks as if it's seen better days, so for fans of this weird item I'd say beware. Broderick Crawford looks as if he's slumming, and his death scene is a hammy delight. Wish I could say the same for the dragon, but maybe I'm missing the point. I was hoping for something Harryhausen-esque, but what appears is endearingly terrible, and there's a childlike sense of embarrassment one feels for poor Mark Forest, who's got to dance around the thing, looking stern faced and serious. If you loved this as a kid, who am I to tell you not to cherish it? But for others lured by the great poster art, steer clear. Those who do admire this cheesy little adventure deserve a better DVD pressing. Buy the poster and hang it, instead.",1165104000,2,1032,4.614130434782608
1623722,5,B00005M1ZY,"The Alpha Video dvd of GOLIATH AND THE DRAGON is from a well-preserved widescreen print, and it's dazzling to look at! To be sure, the color balance goes a bit wonky in a few outdoor scenes, but the aquamarine trees and purple skies almost seem intentional, given the strangeness of director Vittorio Cottafavi's vision. If all the old sword and sandal epics were in this good a shape, the genre would attract many more fans. Great quality for a great price!

The movie itself is a delirious muscleman fantasy from start to finish. A bearded Mark Forest shows off the biggest pecs and widest lats of his generation, and melts everyone with his smile (except scar-faced Broderick Crawford as the cranky villain). The costumes are beautiful, the sets are extravagant, the exterior landscapes are a lush paradise, the monsters are huge puppets, and just when you think the story can't become more bizarre...it does! An absurdly majestic music score by Les Baxter strives to match the melodrama of a hero who dares to revolt against the gods themselves.

Cottafavi will try just about anything to dazzle and disorient the viewer. In one scene, as Goliath approaches, looms above, and then passes over the camera, the point of view turns completely upside-down; the effect is so unexpected and audacious I had to laugh out loud! This is fearless (and yes, perhaps sometimes mindless) filmmaking, and the result is truly dreamlike, if not downright mythic.",1139097600,20,1450,4.962962962962963
7944573,3,B00005M1ZY,"This is a fun, if unintentionally hilarious, Italian sword-and-sandal film.  Mark Forest is impressive as the heroic strongman and Broderick Crawford does a good job as the evil king.  The English dubbing is not bad either.",1513036800,,223,5.166666666666667

7944575,4,B00005M1ZY,"GOLIATH AND THE DRAGON (aka: HERCULES' REVENGE, VENGEANCE OF HERCULES) stars Mark Forest (HERCULES AGAINST THE MONGOLS, KINDAR THE INVULNERABLE) as the titular titan. The action starts right away, as Goliath must battle a three-headed, fire-breathing dog monster! This takes about ten seconds, as it's more of a fire-eating, three-headed sausage. Goliath is seeking to acquire the fabled ""blood diamond"".  To do so, he will have to face the hideous bat-man-beast! He does, and crushes it in five seconds! Meanwhile, the eeevil king Eurystheus (Broderick Crawford!) plots destruction and doom. Eurystheus is sort of the Al Capone of the ancient world. He'll do anything to stop Goliath, before he can bounce him off of his throne. When Goliath delivers the diamond to the God of Vengeance, its rightful owner, he looks forward to a life as a homebody. After some fun, uprooting trees, the human half-track arrives at his abode. Immediately, he is met by his pouting, sulking brother, Illo (Sandro Moretti), looking chic, in his mod mini-dress and bracelets. Illo pines for his long-lost-love, Thea (Federica Ranchi). The next thing Goliath knows, Illo has gone searching for Thea, and has been captured by Eurystheus!  Now, Goliath must save his brother, and everyone else, before Eurystheus subjects them to be squished by an elephant!  Goliath, a bit miffed, fights an -obviously drugged- elephant, and becomes a wrecking-ball, toppling the city! On the run, Goliath manages to pi$$ off a centaur, who makes a deal w/ Eurystheus! All heck breaks loose, as Big-G defies the gods! Goliath takes on the great dragon! Now, we're talking! This is fairly well-realized, as the monster is both stop-motion, and a big puppet head. This battle lasts almost twenty seconds. Where does Goliath keep his spare mini-skirts? Can he rally his strength to defeat Eurystheus, once and for all? Oh yes! There will be an apocalyptic finale! Goliath finally gets his chance to throw his enemies around like meatballs! Oh, by the cheeeze-gods, this is awesomeness itself!...",1500854400,2,2054,5.180722891566265
