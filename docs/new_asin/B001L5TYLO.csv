8317386,1,B001L5TYLO,"Please note the following about this product: ""This product is manufactured on demand using DVD-R recordable media. Amazon.com's standard return policy will apply."" This means there is a higher likelihood that the video content on these 60 Minutes discs will not last nearly as long as what consumers are used to when DVDs are professionally mastered onto discs that are better suited to long-term or archival content storage.

The discs likely will work during Amazon.com's normal 30 day return period (and Amazon.com's extended holiday return period, through Jan. 31, 2009). But, it is likely there will be problems with any DVD or computer playing the content in as little as a year from purchase. This is not worth the money because it is akin to buying an overpriced rental item.",1228608000,3,784,5.030769230769231
