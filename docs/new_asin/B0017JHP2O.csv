However; 'Tae Bo', concentrates and emphasizes on the honing and training of working on the center of the body. In other words, focusing on working the 'Abs'; in correlation with 'Tae Bo' striking based aerobic workout. ""Cardio Kung Fu"", isn't just a knock-off of 'Tae Bo', utilizing Chinese Kung Fu techniques. It is a totally complete and unique Martial Arts workout. Sifu T.J. Storm's 'Cardio Kung Fu', has a unique approach, although it doesn't have Billy Blanks 'Tae Bo' emphasis on concentrating on the 'Abs'. It uses the 'Whole body workout'; approach and mentality. I would recommend this workout, any day, over the infamous; ""PX90 & Insanity"" style training regimes!!!! In other words, you can train in ""Cardio Kung Fu"", and not worry about suffering a coronary in the process!!!! 'PX90 & Insanity' workouts, in reality, are meant for people with very
Iittle body fat, and have athletic-like endeavors, or occupations. Basically, for people who are more healthy and in shape, than your average everyday schmuck ( you know, for people like you and especially me )! Please note, ""Cardio Kung Fu"", does use traditionally based Kung Fu techniques, but it's done in an aerobic-style format! So, if you want tradition and real classical Kung Fu training, this is not the series for you. When I get the second video, I'll make another commentary. Thank you",1482451200,,1513,4.960629921259843

This video was just to show you how to do the moves. I guess if you needed it for this reason to learn the moves, this video is for you.",1373155200,,279,3.912280701754386
