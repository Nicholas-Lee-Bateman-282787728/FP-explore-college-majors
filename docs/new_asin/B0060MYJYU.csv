4913118,5,B0060MYJYU,"I love the way this show is animated. It is bold and refreshing. The stories are scripted in a way that is not to odd but too grude. Families act this way but are never shown on national tv. The main cast and characters bring out the best in the show; Bob, Linda, Tina, Gene and Louise make the show great. Season two will be a great dvd buy.",1354838400,3,342,3.971014492753623
4913119,5,B0060MYJYU,"Intro
I was initially turned off by the animation, but the voice acting is fantastic. H. Jon Benjamin as Bob is great a central character, Kristen Schall as Louise is believable devious which makes it wonderful to watch and Eugene Mirman as Gene is always enjoyable.

Pros
+ Great family dynamic with unique characters
+ Hilarious dialogue
+ Wonderful setting for episodes to take place.

Cons
~ Animation can turn some away.",1354752000,3,425,4.888888888888889

4913123,5,B0060MYJYU,Bobs burgers is a Fresh new concept with laugh out loud dialogue. A must see!!! I've watched each episode several times over and still find it just as funny as the first time!,1351036800,,175,4.333333333333333
4913124,5,B0060MYJYU,"Bob's Burgers just keeps getting better. Throughout the first season,  the characters  grew on me,  and in season 2, the series really hit its stride.  They have great actors, and the episodes get funnier : Bob day afternoon,  the Emmy nominated BurgerBoss, Beefsquatch. Now that The Simpsons,  IMO,  are past their prime, and King of the Hill is no more,  Bob's Burgers is ready to take their place at the top of the animated heap.",1349481600,,432,4.666666666666667
4913125,4,B0060MYJYU,"...besides Fringe.
This season is just as good as the first but unlike a five star rating like I gave the first, I couldn't because they only made this season nine episodes. And will probably sell it for the same price as a regular season.
Anyway, I like all the episodes at least. One issue though, is that alot of people liked the season finale ""Beefsquatch"" episode but I just found Gene to get annoying quickly. Maybe re-watching it on DVD will change my mind. The best episode for me would have to be ""Bad Tina"", but then again Tina is the funniest thing about this show(Besides the title chracter, of course).
In conclusion; if they sell it for the right price(it only being nine eps) I'll be picking this up along with my first season because it is worth a buy and wouldv'e gotten five stars, but again, you know why.",1338595200,4,824,4.427631578947368

 The only thing changed in other seasons is the banner inside....sadness.
I would give it a 4 for that but i love this show so much i cant.
 The only episode from the whole 5 seasons I don't really like is when he visits his dad. Thats it. Thats crazy huh?

I can not in good conscience just sit here and pretend that Bob's Burgers doesn't employ some really maddening celebrities.
I can not STAND Sarah Silverman, and after the disastrous DNC event where she stood on stage and wagged her finger at Bernie supporters, looked down her nose and told us, ""YOU'RE BEING RIDICULOUS!"" I will never watch anything that has her in it.
Wanna blame someone for giving us Trump?
Blame Sarah Silverman, John Oliver and a few other really deplorable characters who have received a paycheck from Bob's Burgers.
They all wagged their fingers in the faces of Bernie supporters and told them to swallow their principles and vote for the most corrupt candidate our nation has ever seen.
Partisan filth...
I'm done with Bob's Burgers.
None of my friends will watch Bob's Burgers because they hate Sarah Silverman...college-age young people despise Sarah Silverman.
To the makers of Bob's Burgers:
I say kill off Sarah Silverman's character Ollie...you could make it hilarious...I *might* come back if you did that.",1503964800,,1144,4.963541666666667

I am currently living in rural Alaska, and we have data caps on our internet.  I can't stream things, I really shouldn't even watch YouTube clips.  Some of it might be my fault, I didn't see that it's for streaming.  I bought this while on vacation where I had unlimited internet.  I watched two seconds, if that, of the first episode, stopped it, and ended up buying this season on iTunes.  I was very hesitant about buying this on DVD because it's DVD MOD, and that has bad reviews. If you want to keep this, if you have room, just go buy it on iTunes.",1484956800,,670,4.147286821705427
4913271,1,B0060MYJYU,"As for many, I am not giving negative feedback to the series. I love it. That's why I want the physical DVDs. I am instead giving negative feedback with regards to the authenticity of the product. Based upon my reading, mine appears to be a unique complaint. Yes, it is clearly of inferior quality and looks like some sort of a rip-off version. However, my real problem is that it only has the first disk. The packaging says that it is the ""Complete 2nd Season"" (as does the Amazon description). Both say that there should be two disks. However, the case only contained Disk 1. In fact, the case looks like it is only designed to hold a single disk. There is no second hub, nor is the single hub that is present long enough to hold two disks (as in some cheap packaging). The product was received sealed so the second disk was not removed. In short, this product was likely delivered to Amazon by the ""manufacturer"" with only one of the two disks present. So, while this is not technically Amazon's fault, the selection of untrustworthy vendors IS Amazon's fault.

4913513,1,B0060MYJYU,"To be clear, along with what everyone else is saying, I love this show.  This single star review is not a comment on Bob's Burgers but rather on Fox's ability to play us all for fools and squeeze higher profits out of loyal fans.  Manufactured-on-Demand releases are a slap in the face to everyone that opens their wallets.  I have no problem with the basic concept--don't make a million copies of something when fewer may sell, just make them as you need them.  However, to give us, essentially, a burned copy of some video files is atrocious.

How about a quick list of the negatives I'm seeing with this MoD release:
* Low-quality cover art.  Looks like it it came off my inkjet printer.
* No special features.  Frankly, I don't care myself but a lot of people do and for this price they should be there.
* Crippled audio.  The show is broadcast in 5.1 but we get a severely lacking 2.0 on these DVDs.
* Coloring issues.  For some reason, the colors are not nearly as vibrant as they are when this show is broadcast.

I stopped after watching part of episode 1 so there may be more issues but I'm done keeping track.

When Fox switched to MoD for American' Dad's 9th season, I was a bit disappointed but not entirely surprise.  For a show Fox cancelled, I wouldn't expect a proper release of remaining seasons.  However, Bob's Burgers isn't cancelled.  It's currently in the middle of its 5th season and has already been renewed for a 6th.  I can't begin to express my disappointment with Fox's release of quality shows with this MoD method.  It's one thing to not get a Blu-ray release when all of the shows fans are asking for it, but to slap us in the face with a full price DVD release that is so crippled it reduces my enjoyment of the show is downright rude.

I received season 1 & 2 as a gift.  Even though season 1 is a proper release, I will be returning both so as to not take part is this customer-hating ritual Fox has embarked upon.  While I love Bob's Burgers and don't disagree with the concept of MoD, I strongly disagree with reducing the quality (and thus manufacturing cost) of a product while keeping its price to consumers the same while not offering a quality alternative.

Shame on you, Fox.  I'm done buying MoD releases and will just have to take my money elsewhere.",1423440000,7,2294,4.427207637231503

Unfortunately, that's not the case.  Instead, apparently Amazon basically prints these DVD releases on demand and the quality that you get demonstrates that.  The case is bad plastic, the DVD insert feels and looks like it was printed on a bad inkjet printer.  The DVDs themselves feel like dollar store burnable DVDs.

4913635,3,B0060MYJYU,"I am deliberately making this review much different in style to all my other reviews - call it a ""consumer review"" if you want.

First my ""bullet points"":

#1: yes, it is DVD-R. Unfortunately, this *is* considered a standard manufacturing practice. It is 100% legit, even if it does look really cheap to do so. Are the Fox guys cheapskates to do this with a paltry 2-disc set? Yes, but they're not the first ones to do it. A variety of PBS shows do this (""Equitrekking"" among others), as do a great many instructional videos. Should they have lowered the MSRP to reflect this (especially for a season that has only 9 episodes)? Quite so, yes. On the other hand, think about how many people flocked to pay $20 a few years ago for ""Blue Harvest,"" which is about 45 minutes and has been shown in reruns many times for FREE on TV; I would still call that a worse moneygrub than this set.

#2: Despite being DVD-R format, mine play just fine. I don't actually care if they're HD or not because a) I don't have a high-end TV, and b) I don't care about such things anyway when it comes to CARTOON shows. I couldn't tell you if the definition or sound is bad...because to me, both seem pretty normal. I didn't notice any weird graininess/pixel/frame rate problems. The sound seemed fine - no voice distortions (a real feat considering how much Louise screams!), no pitch issues, etc. Yes, it's possible that set to set varies in quality. If yours have that much trouble playing, they do have a refund policy around here.

#3: these discs don't have ""cheap stickers"" on them, as someone noted. No stickers at all. They merely have very basic graphics printed on the topside. This was another budget-cutting move.

#4: my discs came mint. If anyone orders this as a new set and sees that much damage, I say again that they DO have a return policy.

Yes, it is disappointing that they did what they did with this set. I was so conflicted about the whole thing that I bought mine ""slightly used"" on a different site so that the manufacturer would not directly get a cut of my money. It's a tough decision when it comes down to having a less-than-orthodox DVD format versus a digital download, but I'm just not a downloading type. Downloading still feels like more of a rip-off to me than buying a DVD set made on a tiny budget.

I have no major complaints about the show itself, though it seemed to get slightly crasser and less zany in season 2. This series was lauded by some as being the successor to ""King of the Hill."" I say NO it is not, although it is still much gentler and more approachable than ""Family Guy"" or similar fare. The characters are somewhat original and make a good mix of contrast - maybe this is why some very ordinary situations can turn into such complicated affairs. The quirkiness and often clever dialogue (example: Gene excitedly shouts ""They'll finger anything with a pulse!"" when he sees a TV station van parked across the street) make up for sometimes odd animation techniques. One way this show IS similar to ""King of the Hill"" is the tendency to use plots that are not just topical drivel. The situations typically turn very fanciful or verge on impossible, but in some of the best ways. In ten years, a lot of these episodes will still feel current and sincere.

Since I wanted to give 4 stars for the show and 2 for the cruddy cheapskate DVD-R choice, I rounded it all to 3 stars. The decision really comes down to how much you want to pay for this set. It's very possible that the price could come down in time (season 1 has dropped to $12 for a new one on Amazon, and you can get used ones for slightly less). On the other hand, perhaps ""made on demand"" items actually *won't* go down much...this has not become a mainstream practice yet and your guess is as good as or better than mine. It seems to me that ""on demand"" items ought to be CHEAPER because, well, they're not sitting on a pile of them (and desperate to unload stock) like they would be with a standard release. Time will tell.",1398729600,,4017,4.43360433604336

4913670,3,B0060MYJYU,"And by terrible, I mean non-existent. As many reviewers have already explained, the episodes are in good quality, and they're all there from that season, but the actual physical DVD(-R) is so atrocious, you can't help but wonder if this was just bootlegged from someone else and making a killing off it. The back of the case has practically nothing on it--the front of the cage(while gratefully the same basic portrait from the 1st season cover) is actually inaccurate--two of the references are from episodes in SEASON THREE. The main menu looks(and sounds) like someone just held a tape recorder up to the TV when an episode was playing. No special features except for a small table read, which is entirely disappointing. The Season 1 DVDs were a gem most definitely worth our money and made with great love and attention. This set, however was straight armed-robbery.

Long story short, the season was great(although short), so if you want it, save time and frustration and just BUY DIGITAL. Trust us, you won't regret it.",1395100800,15,1025,4.890804597701149

4913763,4,B0060MYJYU,"This dvd set is not as bad as some reviewers claim it to be. Yes these are DVR's. Yes, I'd prefer a regular studio release. But I own season 2. I have watched the dvds countless times and have not yet had any problems with these dvds. The video/audio quality is excellent. I have had no issues with these dvds what so ever. Some reviewers complain that this set only contains 9 episodes. But that's because that's how many episodes fox decided to produce for season 2. I agree with other reviewers that an official studio release would be better, but I am perfectly content with this release. So if you don't mind owning a dvr set and don't really care much about dvd extras, I recommend this. Hopefully fox will release a better set at some point. But for now, I have no problem with this set. I can't tell other fans what to think/feel about the dvd releases, so I will let you make your own choice.......",1383868800,2,907,4.372781065088757

We were so disappointed that even this 'special feature' was lacking!!  In this day and age, it is EXPECTED to be there, unless you are buying a public-domain super-discounted poor quality DVD.  I wish the 'closed caption status' of EVERY product would be disclosed as part of the product description.  I have not often been burned by the fact that if the description doesn't SAY it is CC then you have to assume it is NOT, but on a 'new' product like this I didn't even check!

This DVD is an excellent souvenir of a terrific show!  Every episode is hilarious and I'll enjoy repeated viewings for many years.  It's rare for a tv show to touch me this way; funny, loving, with realistic characters.  ""Bob's Burgers"" is as intelligently written, and voiced, as any animated show ever to grace the little screen!  Many thanks to the cast and crew of this ""one-of-a-kind"" masterpiece.  I highly recommend this collection to anyone looking for lots of laughs with lots of feeling.  A true classic already.",1370995200,2,672,4.833333333333333
4913906,2,B0060MYJYU,"So i'm am pretty sure that i was what is being shipped is a bootleg or the saddest DVD set ever. Both disks are DVD-R's and the printed insert is low on quality.
As for the show itself it is one of my favorite and the show quality itself on these disks is very high. So if you don't mind what looks like a bootleg set then order away. As for the show itself i would rate 5 stars but I dropped it cause the cheap feel of the set.",1370822400,34,428,3.7666666666666666
4913907,5,B0060MYJYU,we love Bob's Burgers season 2. could have had a little more in the DVD like season 1 but still loved it. and can't wait for season 3.,1370822400,,134,3.8214285714285716
4913908,5,B0060MYJYU,"Bob's Burgers is one of those shows that is hard to get in to at first, but man is it great when you do! Season 2 is when the show really takes off!

Bob's Burgers is different from the other Animation Domination programs because it uses smart humor, and not rascist and fart jokes such as Family Guy. This show is simply one of the best out there, and Fox better keep this if they know what's good for them.",1370044800,7,408,4.1
4913909,5,B0060MYJYU,"Very good show. It takes a couple of viewings to fully appreciate it, but once you get hooked, you get hooked! The second season isn't as good as the first season, but still very good. It isn't as long, but the third season is a full season that is twice as long as the first season and three times as long as the second. This show has great re-play value.",1369440000,,356,4.1
4913910,1,B0060MYJYU,"This review is for the DVD-R version of Bob's Burgers Season 2, not the show itself.  The show is great!  Fox decided to release season 2 on the cheap: the jewel case is low quality, the disks are ultra low quality (they also come with scratches all over them, free of charge), cheap stickers on the front of the disks instead of what you would expect from an official release, almost no special features.  I can't believe Fox has the stones to charge $23 for 9 episodes and not even produce a quality DVD set.  DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!  If this is type of garbage product that Fox is going to release for it's TV shows, they will not get another dime of my money.  I'd rather keep the shows on my DVR and fast forward through commercials before I buy another DVD-R product.  I urge everyone that feels the same about the DVD-R sets to write reviews about them and show the tools that run Fox home entertainment what happens when they try to cheat and steal from the people that give them money.",1369180800,114,993,4.306451612903226
4913911,1,B0060MYJYU,Just in case u didn't read the description of the DVDs these r dvd-r not yiur regular pressed DVDs that most store bought releases are which wouldn't be bad if they weren't priced the same as a normal DVD these are what people burn themselves but with better video quality.,1368921600,38,273,4.48
4913912,5,B0060MYJYU,"At least Fox bothered to put this incredible show out even if it is DVD-R. I do believe that the price should be lowered considering there are only 9 episodes but what can you do. I personally would have liked for them to put two and three in a set together and release it commercially, but I'm happy this is out so soon. But guys, DVD-R's are more fragile so be careful!",1367971200,12,371,4.166666666666667
4914010,5,B0060MYJYU,"Really great, obviously.  But too short!  There were only nine episodes.  I need more Bob's Burgers in my life than nine episodes.",1367884800,5,130,4.818181818181818
4914011,1,B0060MYJYU,"I already submitted a review to this but apparently it must've been deleted. Well, I want people to know about this so here is my second attempt to submit this and unfortunately isn't as detailed as my first... Bob's Burgers season 2 is a fine season of a fine show. Not the best show out there but a pretty good one and I know a terrible money-grub when I see it, so please don't assume I hate the show, because I don't. Not only are there four less episodes in this DVD set than the last one, but there are no commentaries (the first one had multiple commentaries on every episode), teases you into thinking there are season 3 episodes by referencing them in the cover art (not to mention the only special feature is a table read for one act of a season 3 episode that isn't even on the DVD) and perhaps worst of all, it's a cheap DVD-R like The Cleveland Show season 3. Thirty dollars for this? Hell no. If you MUST watch these, stream them on Netflix. Avoid at all costs, contact Fox and Amazon and try to get them to release actual DVD sets instead of this garbage.",1367798400,102,1070,4.25
4914012,5,B0060MYJYU,Bobs burgers is so funny. Why the second season is not on Netflix or Hulu I have no idea. But it was well worth it,1367712000,,114,3.6
4914013,5,B0060MYJYU,"Awesome show, which is why, in the U.K. it's buried at 2 A.M. on a crappy music channel. Prime time being reserved for, and clogged with, pitiful reality shows and soaps.
For those that have stumbled across it, it's an oasis of joy, witty and constantly hilarious.
Which is why I'm here to bag the DVD. So uh, what's with this download crap? I want a tangible product dammit, with pretty packaging. I'm old fashioned yes, a dying breed maybe, but I want little shiny discs that make me feel I've gotten something for my money. Maybe with some nice extras letting me in on how they created this wonderful show or even just a snazzy menu warming my heart as I settle in the for fun.
May as well just record it off the T.V. if all I'm getting is what I'd get if I robbed the show off the net. Much as I realise that's not supporting the show I also don't want to encourage the download only easy option for lazy assed studios.",1367366400,5,923,4.25

There were also rings in the center part of the disc that I haven't been even able to clean off.
On the one disc my favorite episode of the show this season skips two times.
Its almost as though someone burnt it and made the disc labels to match what theyd look like and just put the cover in the case.
