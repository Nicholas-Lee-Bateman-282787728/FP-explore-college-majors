8584059,3,B00COQU0NK,"Yes, it's Bogart in a movie (1 hr & 7 min) from 1932.  But the movie itself is just okay.  Not much in the way of drama or tension or even comedy.  It's not bad, it's just average.  At best, it's good to see Bogart before he became ""Bogart/Bogie.""",1506816000,,247,3.979591836734694
8584060,4,B00COQU0NK,"Love Affair, the 1932 Columbia Pictures release, was early enough that Bogie wasn't big noise yet. Here, he snags only the second billing, his name trailing that of his leading lady, Dorothy Mackaill, on the billboard. Note that this made sense at the time as Dorothy Mackaill back in 1932 was the more ballyhooed actor, a silent movie star who managed to gracefully transition to talkies.

Her character, Carol Owen, is an heiress and an adventurous socialite. One day she has this hankering to be an aviatrix, and off she goes to procure flying lessons, and that's how she meets Humphrey Bogart's character. Carol takes an instant fancy to Jimmy Leonard (Bogie), and the movie goes on to show their surface commonalities. He's a whirling dervish of a pilot. She's a demoness behind the wheel. However, Jimmy keeps his nose to the grindstone. Her life is a lark. And whereas his core traits reside in the neighborhood of hard work and common sense and practicality, she is flighty and carefree. She play craps and guzzles bootleg swill and is rich as Croesus.

But not as rich as Croesus, it turns out. Carol finds out - during one of her wild Prohibition parties in which her posh home serves as a speakeasy for the upper crust - that she isn't nearly as in the money as she thinks. Her financial adviser (Hale Hamilton) tells her she must economize, must liquidate her assets. A game Carol, still not taking it seriously, jumps up and begins auctioning off her faithful butler of thirty years. I guess no one bit, because her butler Kibbee (Halliwell Hobbes) hung around until the end of the movie.

Jimmy Leonard isn't nearly as impressed with Carol's terribly extravagant lifestyle. Invited to one of those wild Prohibition shindigs, he ducks out early. He later confides to her: ""All that flaming youth stuff gives me a vast pain in the neck.""

Jimmy isn't just a pilot. He's also an inventor. Ergo, that scene in which he conducts his research by holding up a model plane in front of a fan. It must've worked, because Jimmy designs a new type of aeroplane motor. Only, now, he requires an investor. But Carol has found out she's as broke as broke can be. Still, she desperately wants to help.

There's a secondary sub-plot that eventually dovetails into the primary narrative. Jimmy has a sister in the shape of a scheming stage actress named Linda Lee (Astrid Allwyn). Linda has got something shady and frowned upon going on with a skeevy Broadway producer Georgie Keeler (Bradley Page). It's an early sign that this movie was made during the pre-Hayes Code era. There's some highly suggestive stuff going on. Linda intentionally keeps her older brother in the dark about her shenanigans. How her arc ties into the main storyline sort of pushes the boundary of credibility, but what are you gonna do? Is it a stretch that the Wall Street financier the sister and the Broadway producer are trying to shake down for money turns out to be the same financial adviser that's so smitten with Carol? I guess, wild coincidences happen all the time.

Equal parts comedy and melodrama, Love Affair is a darn watchable early talkie, thanks to solid performances by our two leads. And thanks to some risque material that a year or two later wouldn't have made it past the prudish Hays Code committee. For instance, there is robust innuendo dropped that Carol and Jimmy spent the night together. Or did I read the following dialogue wrong?

- Carol: ""Are you asking me because you came last night and happened to be here this morning?""
- Jimmy: ""You're from Cartier's and I'm from Woolworth's.""

Did I make it seem as if Carol and Jimmy's romance went off without a hitch? Far from it, son. It's a rocky love story because, otherwise, why make a movie? Face it, these two lovebirds have very different sensibilities. And then there's the third leg in the shape of that Wall St. financier. And Jimmy's getting so preoccupied with Carol to the extent that he lets his work go that his good pal Gilligan (Jack Kennedy) throws shade at him: ""You were on your way up, and you tripped on a skirt.""

Bogie was still some years away from stardom. So maybe the biggest draw of this movie is in seeing him in an early role and playing very much against type. His character here isn't some hard-boiled gumshoe or gangster. Jimmy Leonard is mild-mannered and soft-spoken and presents an ardent romantic side. Still, you can't keep the tough Bogie image down. There is a scene later on in which Jimmy takes a mean swing at his sister's sleazy conspirator.",1490054400,,4537,4.704030226700252
