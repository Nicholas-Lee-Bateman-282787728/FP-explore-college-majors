8405588,1,B003U1XGI4,"Walter E. Smithe Furniture Co. has figured out a way to make the customer pay for their commercials, and LOTS of them!  I always read reviews:  how did I miss the reviews for this video?!  PLEASE do not buy this.  You will be SO disappointed.  It's not even represented honestly, because all it contains is a Kukla, Fran & Ollie episode (11min.), but NO MAGIC DOOR.  ""The Magic Door""  is mainly a narration of the history of The Magic Door with some clips of the actual show.  Amazon should know that this is not honest advertisement....  I feel like I flushed my money right down... so angry!",1425859200,5,593,4.4672897196261685
8405589,1,B003U1XGI4,Buyer Beware!! This DVD does NOT contain an episode of The Magic Door!!  What it does contain is an 8 minute short video recorded by the cast and crew in 1987 - and they are looking back at the show and remembering it. They show several VERY SHORT clips and talk about it a little - and that's it! NO EPISODE!!! Don't be fooled as I was that you are going to see a 25 minute original episode from the show... All you get are a few very short clips. SHAME on the producers of this DVD for misrepresenting it like this!!!,1331510400,9,519,4.088235294117647
8405590,2,B003U1XGI4,"It's always a joy to revisit the incomparable Kukla, Fran and Ollie, and that is true of even this miserable DVD.  Your problem may well be ever actually SEEING the program!  There is no way to cut to the menu or to the program without sitting through what seem like interminable commercials for a furniture company.  I've tried to play this many times and it's always a hit-or-miss proposition as to whether or not you'll FINALLY reach the program itself.  And if you are thinking of copying it onto a tape or DVD-R, forget it; despite the scant attention they gave to preparing this DVD, they were careful to copy protect it!",1323043200,5,627,4.571428571428571
