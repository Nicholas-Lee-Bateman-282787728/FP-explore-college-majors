8295265,5,B001DX9ATU,"This DVD was a good idea. A collection of actors, actresses, and various crewmembers sharing their memories of working with Lucio Fulci.
For fans this is great. Maybe boring to some, but over all, it was a wonderful idea for a unique artist. Rumored to be a Volume 2 in the works!",1274227200,3,280,4.403846153846154
8295266,2,B001DX9ATU,"Interesting, if you are a Fulci fan. But hardcore Fulci fans will find it boring.
No movie clips, no artwork of posters, no stills...nothing.
Sound on some of the interview clips are bad.
Maybe Volume 2 will have all the bells and whistles.",1238976000,2,240,4.604651162790698
8295267,3,B001DX9ATU,"I was a little bit let down with this.  It pains me to say that being a huge Fulci fan and all, but it's the truth.  At a glance it's easy to assume that this DVD is a documentary about Lucio Fulci, but if you skim the description, you'll see it only kinda sorta is.  It's numerous people giving their recollections/anecdotes/praises and opinions about Fulci(for a guy who has a reputation as being a cruel tyrant, you'd never really guess that he was considering most of the folks interviewed loved the guy).  That's it.  There is absolutely nothing else to the DVD.  You can watch them individually or ""play all"".  It's divided into three categories-Crew members, fellow directors and actors.  I was actually surprised and impressed with the very large selection of interviewees.  It's almost everyone you can think of that's worked with Fulci(still living at the time of course).  Some interviews are longer, some are shorter than a minute.
Granted, this could be just what some folks are looking for, and that's fine.  For me, this format and the flow became kind of tedious after awhile.  I wanted something more to it-I'm not sure what exactly-just something more.
But as I said, this may be perfect for some people.  It's certainly worth purchasing if you're a hardcore Fulci fan(and who isn't?)",1234137600,6,1302,4.8108108108108105
