2004474,5,B0001I55S8,I've been waiting for this day since I heard the show was getting canceled. I can now ditch the last few episodes that I saved on VHS. Can't wait to see the season 1 Christmas special again.,1086393600,,190,4.162162162162162
2004475,5,B0001I55S8,"One best teen shows on television, sadly got canceled after only 2 seasons, with the last episode ending in a unresolved cliffhanger. I truly loved this show, it's one of those teen shows that we rarely see on televison drama/comedy/spoof. I for one was very happy when I found they are releasing this on DVD (didn't get a chance to record them all when it aired)",1084579200,2,363,4.515151515151516
2004476,5,B0001I55S8,"How long have my friends and I said that they should release the complete series of Popular on DVD???? Since before that show was even cancelled! I haven't been so happy about a dvd set since they released ""My So-Called Life""! It should be the complete series as oppossed to just the first season - but beggars can't be choosers I guess! If you don't know about this show I seriously think you should check it out! There is nothing better than Mary Cherry, Harrison, Sugar Daddy, Lily, Brooke, Sam and the rest of the gang and their laughable (and sometimes cry-able) lives!",1083369600,2,574,4.58252427184466

I was just writing a letter to the Wb this very night about releasing Popular on DVD, and I come onto Amazon looking for Felicity.  Oh my gosh, I think I might just be having a really great day.  I am ordering it today because this was my favorite show and it still is. And it will be forever as of September 21!!!",1083283200,,364,4.027777777777778
2004478,5,B0001I55S8,"Isn't it funny how chain reactions happen everyday, sometimes leading to fantastic morsels such as this, the release of hte best Television series ever on DVD?
Only yesterday I was discussing Melissa Etheridge with a friend (she is performing here in Portland, ME tonight) and Tammy Lynn Michaels inevitably came up in the conversation.  My friend had never heard of Popular, so I went online to find pages and sites devoted to the show.  Lo and Behold, amazon.com showed the series would be released on DVD late in the summer.
For those of you who are not familiar, BUY THIS DVD!  Each and every character was drawn so vividly.  Yes, they sometimes border on  insane and often wander into a sea of exagerration, but that is what made the show so deliciously wonderful.  Every time the show turned a corner, a new character or scenario would enter the mix.  Think of Ms. Glass, the lesbian science teacher, or Adam, the hunky ambiguously gay new student, Cherry Cherry, Spam, Nicole's forked tongue, all of it, sinfully delicious!
Rent it, buy it, watch it, wait for season 2, and pray that someday the cast will reunite to give the series a proper ending. (...)  Everyone needs to watch this and revive this!  It truly is that good.",1082505600,9,1233,4.6976744186046515
2004479,5,B0001I55S8,"I've been hoping ever since they ended the show that they'd put in on DVD! This was my favorite show when it was on. Actually, it's the only show on the WB network that I ever actually watched. I'm not too into trendy shows, but I was obsessed with Popular, and if I missed it one week I would freak. The cliffhanger really killed my spirit. I want to know what happened! The price is a bit steep... but I might just have to put out the money for this, especially if it helps the chances of season 2 being released on dvd! I am in heaven knowing that it's actually being released and I'm actually still young enough to appreciate it! LOL",1080604800,,637,4.186991869918699
2004480,5,B0001I55S8,"This was a great series.  The only problem was that last episode (of the series) was one of those that must have been unexpected- it ended in a major cliff-hanger.  Sometime I just wish shows just ended each season as if it was the last episode- just in case.  At the very least they could have had a movie, if only to tie-up loose ends.  Maybe they will someday...it could be a reunion special.",1078099200,,395,4.297297297297297

2004486,5,B0001I55S8,One of the best teen shows out there! I remember when this on the WB so it cool to watch the episodes again. I would recommend to anyone who likes high school dramas. It's like Freaks and Geeks but a bit different. Love it!,1410912000,,223,4.090909090909091
2004487,5,B0001I55S8,"I remember this show and  I am so happy its on dvd.  So funny, so true.  My highschool experience was not as dramatic or harrowing, but this show speaks to the politics of highschool and how unbearable it was and still continues to be for some.  Awesome writing, biting, sarcastic wit.  Right up my alley as far television is concerned.  Too bad Popular only lasted 2 seasons.  Recommended viewing.",1404086400,,398,4.681159420289855

2004490,3,B0001I55S8,"This is the first production from the creator of GLEE. In a sense it's GLEE with an attitude and without the music. This show is about the popular and outcast kids in high school and how their worlds come together when a parent from each side marry each other. It's funny, edgy, and most of all real. It is very well written and launched several careers. Their are characters that everyone can relate to and story-lines for everyone ranging from funny to emotional, I highly recommend this show!",1361664000,,495,4.636363636363637
2004491,5,B0001I55S8,"great 90's show that should stayed on the air a lot longer.  typical teenage drama with mean girls, outcasts, and basically people that are misunderstood.  but what would high school be without the drama and cliches every which way?  the show keeps you entertained with witty remarks, comments, and comebacks between the characters. its a nice flashback if you seem to have forgotten what high school was like.  you might even find some kind of realization and relevance to your own high school life while watching.",1359072000,,515,4.953488372093023
2004492,5,B0001I55S8,It's like an Ally McBeal during the High School years with a little After-School special thrown in. Plus Delta Burke rocks in her cameos!,1355788800,,137,4.75
2004493,5,B0001I55S8,"This season of Popular can be classified, like many other briefly run shows, as one of the greatest shows not many people saw. The only thing I would like to add to all the other reviews is that there are audio commentaries on two of the episodes that are worth the listen. In particular, there is some brief discussion about what was going to happen in season 3. This is also true for the DVD set released for season 2. If you want to know - but the DVDs. I love them!",1324166400,,469,4.108695652173913
2004494,5,B0001I55S8,"Popular was a great TV series, essentially a non-musical precursor to Glee -- and both series are the brainchildren of Ryan Murphy. Unfortunately, ihowever, Popular fell apart in its second season and wasn't renewed.

The series revolves around two girls -- head cheerleader Brooke and student journalist Samantha -- who are leaders of their respective -- and warring -- cliques, essentially the jocks and the geeks. The conceit is that Brooke and Sam are suddenly forced to inhabit the same household and become stepsisters as Brooke's divorced dad and Sam's widowed mom fall in love and move in together. However, except for their differing hair colors and styles (Brooke, played by Leslie Bibb sports a sleek blonde bob, whereas Sam, played by Carly Pope, wears her brunette hair long and wavy), and fashion styles (Brooke's look is tailored and classic, Sam's more experimental and artsy), the girls are, facially, almost ringers for one another (a fact they have yet to discover, or exploit, ala the old Patty Duke Show).

Rounding out the ensemble are star quarterback Josh, Brooke's on-again, off-again boyfriend; Harrison John, Sam's best friend who has a longstanding crush on Brooke; Nicole, Brooke's sardonic best friend; Lily, a student activist who becomes Brooke's rival for Josh; Mary Cherry, a debutante from Texas with more money than brains; Carmen, a member of Sam's circle who is probably the best dancer from the school, but was turned down for a spot on the cheerleading squad because of her weight; Sugar Daddy, Josh's best friend and fellow football player; and chemistry teacher Bobbi Glass, arguably the prototype for Glee's Sue Sylvester.

Some episodes are stronger that others, with the very strongest concentrated in the first two thirds of the season, but all are generally superior to the second season, when Popular lost much of what made it special, and became mundane and derivative. (Perhaps, as with the original My So-Called Life,  audiences weren't ready until Glee came along almost a decade later. Overall, though, Popular gets inside the heads of its characters more than Glee, and those characters have more depth and subtlety; indeed, in some ways Popular can be viewed as the smarter older sibling of Glee.)  In particular, the first season's special holiday episode, ""Fall On Your Knees,"" is a standout: the best retelling of Charles Dickens's oft-parodied ""A Christmas Carol"" that I've ever seen.",1314230400,,2443,5.159090909090909
2004495,5,B0001I55S8,"Popular is very reminiscent of being back in high school - teenage drama, the life and death of it all, while at the same time the real issues that shape our future.  Popular is about teenagers and all the ups and downs they experience in high school - to say that it's one of a kind roller coaster is an understatement.  Sam and Brooke, the two main characters, travel in completely different circles.  Sam's circle of friends includes Harrison, Lilly and Carmen.  Brooke's circle includes Nicole, Josh, Merry Cherry and Sugar Daddy.  No matter how hard these two groups try to stay apart, they constantly find themselves crossing over.

The title of the show implies superficial plot lines and conflicts, but this show is anything but.  While cloths and glamour play a large role,  every episode focuses on very real issues that plague teenagers of every generation: body image, glbt, teen pregnancy, bullying, treating others the way you want to be treated, and those are just to name a few.  Even with such serious undertones and themes, it is hard to not feel more light hearted and happy at the end of each episode.

Popular is deffinitly the 90s version of Glree - why this show was cancelled I will never understand!",1300579200,,1224,4.731132075471698
2004496,5,B0001I55S8,"I absolutely love Popular.  Glee (the new show from Ryan Murphy) is ironically much more popular than this series many times over.  Glee's still one of the shows I'm most excited to see each week, but Popular is Ryan Murphy's golden child (at least among his teenage series, for those Nip/Tuck fans).  Popular is the non-musical nonetheless overshadowing older sibling of Glee.

Popular's probably also cornier than Glee and mostly outrageous, but I still find it refreshing after almost ten years.  Another reason to watch, for you Ugly Betty fans, is Harrison John, otherwise known as one of Betty's love interests Henry, and Christopher Gorham in real life.  He's utterly adorable and isn't just the geeky guy you're rooting for (His Popular mom was also the mom on The Wonder Years!).

Anyway, just a question that spurred my review: does anyone remember when the retail price of this was about $40?",1292025600,,903,4.940397350993377

2004498,5,B0001I55S8,"I was happy to find this on Amazon. I found myself strangely attracted to this show while it was on tv and missed it when it was cancelled. So, now I can watch the first season and laugh again at the crazy antics of these teens.",1268697600,,228,3.9782608695652173
2004499,5,B0001I55S8,I love this show. I remembered it from years ago and have been waiting for it to drop in price. Which it has not for years. Anyway I love this show it is very teenage but I still love the blast from the past!,1229817600,,208,3.75
2004500,5,B0001I55S8,"I loved this show when it was on tv back in 1999/2000.

It's been fun watching the episodes.  I love Mary Cherry, such a funny character!

The one thing I don't like is just to do with the packaging.  The plastic case that holds the dvd's doesn't hold the dvd's in properly, so when you open it, it looks like there is a dvd missing, but in fact one has fallen into the other slot.

Overall I enjoyed and still enjoy this show and it's social commentary.  Only wish it ran for more than 2 seasons.",1203033600,,497,4.125
2004501,5,B0001I55S8,"Popular - The Complete First Season has to be the second best show that the WB produced (Felicity being the first!) Created by Ryan Murphy who later went on to create Nip/Tuck. Popular sets around a high school and centers around a popular girl, Brooke. She is a cheerleader but depises it. She meets Sam, who will become her mortal enemy, the twist is she has no other choice but to get along with her, Brooke's father is now dating Sam's mother. The supporting cast is amazing especially Mary Cherry, she's a freakin' hoot. I highly recommend this comedy/drama. Too bad this cool show only lasted two seasons but hey some of the best shows never got the recognition they deserved. Don't hesitant buy this dvd today!",1192233600,,717,4.653543307086614

2004503,4,B0001I55S8,"I watched practically the whole first season though unfortunately missed the last two episodes (season finale) which I was disappointed about.  Popular is entertaining and funny at the same time, dealing with issues that kids deal with in the west in an entertaining way. I liked the fact that it isn't so ""formal"", it has a nice creative style to it.",1153612800,,351,4.754098360655738
2004504,4,B0001I55S8,"Popular was a WB show that didn't manage to find its audience, because of its witty satirical jokes about high school combined with the serious drama of actually being in high school.  However, this series was not given the credit it deserved, and is a wonderful show that manages to make light of the four years most people want to forget while covering some pretty serious issues.  Leslie Bibb and Carly Pope are great, and the supporting cast are fairly good actors as well.  Plus, a great theme song!",1140307200,3,504,4.640449438202247
2004509,3,B0001I55S8,"The show popular had potential, but nothing more. It wasn't an awful show nor a great show. The show's main idea was not original at all. High school setting, high school drama, teen love, teen angst etc. What Popular had was a special cast of characters who were each unique in their own way. Each character had a believable and realistic trait about them, only their personalities were blown out of proportion, and lets be honest: it made good TV. In Hollywood we have seen before a group of ""friends"" who are inseperable and have a lasting bond. In Popular we have a group of ""friends"" who are not secure. Of course each character has a relationship but it is not a tight knit group that has a love for one another that cannot be broken.

Instead of having conflicts from outside forces, this group of people are constantly fighting with themselves. Inside their group are problems, and this is an essence of importance. It was realistic in a way, because no group of friends is stable. There are always manipulative, self absorbed, jealousy issues- and Popular executes them well. The downfall with Popular seemed to equal out the greatness of the show. I will be honest when I say, some of the stuff in episodes were just plain stupid and not neccesary  at all. This is probably why the older audience would avoid the show - and the younger audiences wouldn't quite grasp the concept. If the writers took out the wacky and crazy child stuff the show might've had a chance. I'm talking about flying to Texas and finding someone in a day, or having a cowboy ""fight"" after school. This is just ridiculous, and what stopped my complete love for it.  No wonder the show only lasted two seasons!

Popular is a diamond in the rough. With a good plot, but bad sub plots - its an average show .  If your willing to fish out the diamond, you might enjoy it. If your not, then don't waste your time. Definetly worth checking out though and if your not satisfied within, say, six episodes - its just not for you.",1139961600,6,2005,4.512396694214876
2004510,5,B0001I55S8,"Sara Rue was fat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Leslie Grossman as Mary Cherry!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Carly Pope has a funny mouth for a White Girl!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Leslie Bibb is half Asian, and it shows at times!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Oh, the show is about High Schoolers??? Sorry, I thought you wanted to know why I gave it 5 stars.",1136592000,3,342,6.0
2004511,5,B0001I55S8,"This is one of those shows that was killed off the air sooner than it should've been. Just like My So Called Life, Freaks and Geeks, Undeclared etc. (incidentally all four shows are about young people told in either very realistic way or in an over the top way, in short so different from the formula of teen dramas), they were not given a chance to develop a bigger audience. We can only wonder how those series would've turned out if it was given the chance to have a longer run.

Even though a bulk of the episodes satirizes/spoofs the popular culture conventions and clich&eacute;s, the repercussions of the engagement of two single parents who happen to have daughters in the opposite social hierarchy drove the season along. The conflicts between the unpopular group headed by Sam (Carly Pope) and the popular group headed by Brooke (Leslie Bibb) provide the groundwork for the satire. This is not exactly a story arc driven series since most of the episodes can be considered ""self contained' or ""stand alone"" episodes.

My favorite character in the show is hands down, Mary Cherry. She is hilarious, edgy, caricature, over the top, and I LOVE IT! Everything about the character, the exaggerated accent, the over the top outfits, the 2 digit IQ, you name it, she's a riot! And huge credit should be given to Leslie Grossman, she is brave for doing what she did since this is the kind of role that would persistently be associated with someone, and Mary Cherry is not exactly the most lovable character.

Another fascinating character is Nicole, she gets to say the one-liners and the sarcastic lines but through some episodes, we were shown a bit of humanity in her character. Even though the storylines of Carmen was almost always veering towards melodrama, some of the really moving scenes revolve around her (""I'm so tired of being the girl with the personality"")

Some notable episodes are: ""Slumber Party Massacre"" (Carmen was heartbreaking as she willingly subscribe to humiliating herself for the sake of being accepted in the popular group), ""Queen B"" (a hilarious episode about the Homecoming Queen campaign), ""Fall on Your Knees"" (A Nicole-centric episode that showed the not always obvious complexity of the character), ""Hope in a Jar"" (a great episode about teenagers even the most perfect looking are conscious about their bodies), ""Hard on the Outside, Soft on the Inside"" (blonds vs. brunettes, plus watch out for Mary Cherry's visually hilarious story with the lobster),  ""Caged!"" (a stylish episode), ""Booty Camp"" (it was funny, satirical, dramatic, and even political), ""Ch Ch Changes"" (A really moving episode. The scene where the ""Popular"" gang cross-dressed was a visual highlight), and ""Two Weddings and A Funeral"" (A really great season ender that satirizes every known convention regarding television sweep stunts and finales that ranges from cliffhangers to stunt casting) The wealth of episodes that I mentioned shows how great the first season was.

This is really a one of kind series that that can make viewers laugh like there's no tomorrow but can also move the viewers into tears. Subtlety is often regarded as a virtue, and rightfully so. But ""Popular"" proves that over the top and campy when done right can be commendable just the same.

2004513,3,B0001I55S8,"therefore it was dropped after season two.

However, the first time I watched it on television, I thought it was witty and humourous, especially the exaggerated acting and circumstances of Mary Cherry.

Now that I've re-watched it, I find the jokes dull and tasteless, although there are certain episodes which are worth watching because of brilliant script-writing such as episode #10 (Fall on Your Knees), #14 (Caged!), #18 (Ch-Ch-Changes), the season finale, #22 (Two weddings and a Funeral).

For example the season finale makes a spoof out of teen flicks, episode #10 is a spoof of Poe's Christmas ghosts, there is also an episode to spoof film noir.",1118534400,,655,5.046296296296297

My one complaint about this particular DVD set, and it's a big one, is that they have taken out several of the songs in many of what I found to be defining moments of the show and replaced them with bland and unoriginal tracks.  Many of my fond memories of the show came from the songs they originally chose.  I will without a doubt purchase the second season, but I'm not looking forward to the musical changes it will inevitably contain.  The change in song is enough to drop this DVD set down to a 3 for me.  Does anyone know why they do this to shows when they are released on DVD?  I've noticed this exact same thing happening on other tv show DVD sets.",1109548800,9,806,4.128205128205129

my favorites are nicole and mary cheery but i aslo liked brooke. carmen at the beginning was a bit of a good character but she started to get on my nerves. the ending however was very shocking when she (do not read this part if you have never seen it and don't want to ruin it) says shes pregnant! is she pregnant from josh? oh wow if so thats gonna be really bad since brooke and josh just got together.

More of a ""parody"" of the usual teen drama, the show stands out in my mind from the usual shows in TV.  It pokes enough fun that you don't take it too seriously, while at the same time still sticking with it's roots.

The show takes an obvious turn for the ""zany"" during the season, which I think is for the best.

The only problem is now that i've had a taste of it, i need more, and the fact that the second season hasn't been released yet (if i may steal this quotation from Mary Cherry) ""is worse than Kathie Lee Gifford singing cabaret!""
How do you describe this show?  It is a teen show that revels in its mockery of other popular formulaic teen shows.  The meta-humour in this series is priceless (otherwise i wouldn't have spent so much money buying it!) and i am willing to beg and plead on bended knee to get them to release the second season...who's with me?",1106265600,3,740,4.190140845070423
2004535,5,B0001I55S8,"I was a fan of the series when it aired and tried to tape it as religiously as possible.  But thanks to bad work scheduling, a VCR that liked to reset its timed programming, and a roommate that wouldn't make sure it was recording while at home, I missed a good 1/3 of the first season and most of the second season.  When I found out this came out on DVD I just HAD to buy it.  And I've NEVER bought a DVD set for a television series until this one.  I loved this show more than any other series that has come out since 1996.  It's really THAT good if you ask me.

Rather than recap what everyone else has already stated, about the stunning stories, tackling a variety of different subjects, the depth of the characters and how well the actors pulled it off, let me just say that it was great to see a show that gave both sides of the story from high school.  Being someone who started off in the ""unpopular"" crowd at school, being a person no one knew, and gradually pulling myself towards the middle (inbetween popular and unpopular) I can relate to all the characters in the show.  Feeling invisible like Carmen, wanting to fit in like Harrison, having causes that mean a lot to you like Lily, trying to be different like Sam, doing your best to please everyone like Brooke, just being crazy yet sweet like Mary Cherry, and yes even being the totaly cruel, manipulative b**** like Nicole.  I think most people have all these sides to them and this show expresses them like no other.  That's why I can sit here and watch this DVD set (And I have like 10 times already, watched the whole thing in 2 days after I got it) over and over again and still catch something I didn't notice before.

My only gripe is the re-recording of the songs that were actually in the show and being replaced by cheap knock-offs or redone altogether.  But otherwise it's a great set.  If you haven't seen this show do yourself a favor and rent it.  Trust me when I say you will be so hooked on it, you'll be running down to your local store to buy it.

That and I hear season 2 is being released in March.  I hope this rumor proves to be true.",1105401600,,2123,4.230769230769231

I wasn't very pleased with the first few episodes, but as the character Mary Cherry (Leslie Grossman) developed, I laughed at every episode since she appeared. I just hope Season 2 comes out on the date that everyone claims (March 8, 2005)...",1104796800,,308,4.618181818181818
2004537,5,B0001I55S8,"I just finished watching the complete first season of this show, and I have to say, I'm just down right shocked that it didn't last longer.  This show was campy, mean, funny, and original.  Yes, it started like a normal teen drama, but after a while you could see that the writers, and the cast just wanted to have more fun with everything.  It also helps that most of the actors in the series do a steller job with their characters, and really try, and succed, at making the show something more than just a chessy WB dramedy.

The set is very well done, with all twenty two episodes on six discs.  The video and audio quality are great.  Extra wise things are a bit scarce, but there are a few episode commentaries with the creators.

The series is well worth the money.  I can see this being a cult favorite for years to come.",1101081600,4,828,4.296774193548387
2004538,3,B0001I55S8,"Originally, I loved this show.  I was in high school at the time and thought it would be interesting to see how they made the show.

The first couple episodes were awesome.  It was very real to see how the popular and unpopular characters acted when Brooke McQueen(Leslie Bibb), the head cheerleader and most popular girl in the grade, and Sam McPherson(Carly Pope), head of the newspaper, parents got married.  With a suporting cast of Brooke's football boyfriend, Josh Ford(Bryce Johnson), her stuck up best friend/ice queen Nicole Julian(Tammy Lynn Michaels), Sam's best friend Harrison(Chris Gorham) and two good friends Carmen(Sarah Rue) and Lily(Tamara Melo), we got to see the struggles of both cliques.

However, towards the middle of the season, it all goes down hill.  The writers decide to shake things up by reversing the popular and unpopular, and the results are a show gone bad.  I dislike how the once ""real"" aspect dissapears and chaos rules.  This is also around the time that ratings slip. Go figure.",1100822400,,1019,4.988165680473373
2004539,5,B0001I55S8,"I loved Popular when it was on The WB.  It's too bad that this show went the same route as Murder One did on ABC - too intelligent for its own good at the time (Murder One incidentally is now available from Amazon. UK for import if you have can play Region 2 discs.)  Shows like 24 and Alias owe much to Murder One, which explored a single trial over an entire season.  Popular also has a lot in common with another great series from the same era - Freaks And Geeks, which is also available on DVD.

Both seasons of Popular start off a little too much on the 'dramatic side,' particularity the subplot with Carmen's mom that pervaded much of the opening of season 2 or the fake dramatic tension of the Brooke and Sam stories from the beginning of season one could be done without.  As the network became less involved in each season as the year wore on, it meant that more MARY CHERRY and outrageous Bio Glass storylines could develop!

Also, not all the music has been replaced in this series.  The production team was able to get the rights to a number of important songs, including ""Rock Lobster"" for the classic episode ""Hard on the Outside, Soft in the Middle;"" the song ""Freedom"" by George Michael for the episode ""Caged,"" and also two Madonna songs ""Ray of Light"" and ""Lucky Star.""  Madonna was a huge fan of this show and I suspect she gave the rights to her songs for free!  In Season 2, there is a big production number to her hit ""Music,"" which I'm sure will remain intact as well.

Speaking of season 2 of Popular, it has been mentioned by Buena Vista as being ""in the works"" for first or second quarter 2005.",1098921600,7,1621,4.337748344370861
2004540,5,B0001I55S8,"I have been a big fan since I first caught this show on Channel 5, on UK television. How could you fail to enjoy a show that feature's Leslie Grossman's Mary Cherry.

For me, it was less about the blonde vs brunette thing, and much more about the Mary Cherry vs the world thing.

Poor, misunderstood Mary Cherry... She was quite willing to spend $1 million on a lobster, she carried ecoli poison in her handbag, she was possessed by Streisand and right at the end, she found that she had an identical twin sister and that her father was a drag queen.

I have bought this and I would advise anyone else to do the same. It's not loaded with extras. Just 3 episodes of audio commentary. This commentary will confirm much of what you expect of the co-creator, Ryan Murphy. Namely, that the character of Mary Cherry is based entirely on him.

I do like the idea of a spin-off featuring Mary Cherry, Cherry Cherry, B-Ho Chil' and even RuPaul reprising his role as Sweet Honey Chil'. Wouldn't that be fantastic?

Don't tease us! We want it!",1096934400,3,1033,4.444444444444445
2004541,5,B0001I55S8,"Even though I only caught the second season of this show when it originally aired on The WB, I immediately fell in love with it.  There's so much good to say about it that it would really probably bore anyone who's never seen the show.

When I heard it was coming out on DVD, I honestly wanted to cry.  I thought for sure it had disappeared forever (kind of like another show I loved from around the same time period, ""Cupid"" on ABC).

At any rate, the DVD has arrived, and, since I have never seen the first season, it's a whole rediscovery of the show for me.  And all I can say is ""Wow.""

I praise Buena Vista for finding the courage to release this on DVD.  I say that only because I'm sure while there's a lot of people out there who are familiar with the show, there are even more who aren't.  So they had to risk not making money on this release.

Apparently though, one way they did ""cover themselves"" was to not pay to have the original songs as heard in the show.  The songs we know and love (except for the Title Song and End Credits song, which the latter was apparently going to be the Title Song at one point) have been replaced with Cover Versions of the songs (a generic studio band) or different versions entirely.  It's cheaper to buy the rights to a ""song"" instead of ""the song as sung by the original artist.""

Having not ever seen season one, it doesn't bother me too much.  What will bother me is when I don't hear ""Abracadbra"" ever time Michelle Lee is on during Season Two, or hearing ""True"" as sung by Spandeau Ballet.

But if it's not having original songs or not having the DVD's at all, I'll have to choose the former instead of the latter.

*EDIT*

Having seen a comment from another reviewer and having listened more carefully to the songs in the show, I have to say that I am indeed wrong in my above statements about ""song replacements.""  Indeed, most of the original songs are intact.  In fact I just watched the BRILLIANT episode ""Ch-ch Changes"" and there is no doubt in my mind that it was David Bowie singing his heart out.",1096588800,7,2059,4.290155440414508

Dear god, anyways I recommend everyone who is an early-90's television fan to buy this dvd. While the show is great, the packaging sucks. I am not kidding. The dvd holsters are so bad that they sometimes let go of the dvds that are inside. Also, the picture quality isn't great, especially for the $50 I forked over for it.

2004544,5,B0001I55S8,"On the surface, Popular was everything I hate - a cheesy teenage-targeted melodrama featuring 30-somethings pretending to be ten years younger, with beautiful women imitating ugly and awkward teens, ridiculously overblown romantic storylines and the usual drug/pregnancy/popular battles.

But secretly Popular was a satire of the above, a wonderfully self-aware show which constantly mocked itself and the genre it represented. It was deliciously camp, featured the greatest character in television history - Mary Cherry - and various close contenders, from Delta Burke as the rich Texan Cherry Cherry, to the wickedly evil Nicole Julian or the crossdressing science teacher Miss Glass. The storylines were ridiculous, and any ""sensible"" plots were deliberatley overdone and often descended into stupid, but wonderful chaos. Liberally peppered with pop culture references, Popular was sly, wicked, clever, sarcastic, and often sick and twisted.

Sadly by the second season, the WB had cottoned on to the subversive tactics of the writing team and network interference ruined almost all of the following episodes, insuring that fans fled, ratings plummetted, and cancellation was inevitable. Still, even if you've never seen a single episode, if you like Freaks and Geeks or the writing of Ryan ""Nip/Tuck"" Murphy, buy the first season. It's wonderful.",1095292800,7,1350,5.645320197044335

The show moved with sharp wit. Fantastic, sharp and hilarious characters that blend into a collage of colorful entertainment.

I actually recorded every episode, commerical free, onto video tapes... and now I can trash them for the real thing!! DVDs!!!!

The shows are each in their own right, kooky and zany and just down right fun as heck! Each episode has a sort of flash and sass to it, it's addictive.

There is absolutely no question, each episode of POPULAR was WRITTEN with care. Picking the absolute right times to make us laugh and the absolute right times to pull our heart strings. Singing, dancing, laughing and crying... all in one show.

Like I said, I'm a male in my thirties, and I'm proof that you don't have to be a teenager to enjoy this show. This show is excellent because it has excellent WRITING!!

If you're looking for a show to pick your spirits up and see some of the best young talents of the future flesh out some wonderful characters, give POPULAR a shot.  I can't wait to get the DVDs in the mail!!  September 21st!! Hurry up and get here!

 I guess it's hard to be on that show though, because 6 girls fighting over popularity can be pretty exausting. Well, either way, i look foward to the first season!  I can't wait for it to come out!  I think that everyone should watch this show! I LOVED IT!",1093305600,2,593,4.221238938053097

2004548,5,B0001I55S8,"Welcome to Kennedy High.  To your right you have the Popular crowd which is headed by Brooke McQueen (head cheerleader), her boyfriend Josh Ford (Star Quarterback), best friend Nicole (biggiest bitch in school), and Merry Cherry (Richiest teenager on the west coast).  To your left you have the un-popular crowd with Sam McFerson (reporter at large), her guy-friend Harrison (typical outcast), Carman (larger girl with a heart of gold), and Lilly (the boyish activist).

Through all the years they have attend school together, they have always wondered what it would be like to be in the others shoes, but still keeping a safe distance from each other.  But then their world is turned upside down, when the head liners of both groups: Sam and Brooke find out that in a little less than 9 months, they will be more than rivals... they will be sisters.

What can be said for Popular, that hasn't already.  It was the freshiest, brilliantly written, and witty show that aired for the two years that it was on the air.  All the characters will be remembered, because they were so unique.  It sad to think that the ratings for the show went from 3 million to 900,000.  But now people will finally have a chance to see what they missed.

I loved this show because It was a spoof on all the other ""Teen Soaps"" out their.  There hasn't really been anything like popular before, nor will there be anything like it again... Hopefully with the DVD sales Buena Vista will realize that they need to make a movie to tie up all the loose ends.",1090022400,41,1528,4.601476014760148

2004550,5,B0001I55S8,"I was one of the 3 million folks who caught the initial run of ""Popular"" on the WB network.
I never watched the upstart network. I only tuned in for ""Buffy"". I saw the commercials for ""Popular"" and did not know what to make of it. It just looked stupid, and the one scene where main characters Sam and Brooke fought and Sam said ""Cancel My Subscription, I'm Through With Your Issues"" just made me think ""Ugh.... Sweet Valley Crap.""
But then one day my brother was supposed to record something for me on TV, and mistakenly recorded the pilot episode of ""Popular"". Figuring it couldn't hurt too much, I watched and was immediately hooked by this funny and often times obsurd teen comedy-drama-satire hybrid.
Popular was the pure escapism that teenagers needed at that time. When ""Dawson's Creek"" kids were spitting out 50 SAT words a minute in their hyperbabble filled storylines. ""Popular"" was the perfect satire of the melodramatic dramas the WB was known for. ""Popular"" was about 2 girls on opposite sides of the social scene who are forced together by their parent's sudden engagement. While it was supposed to be serious, at it's core it was a comedy. And a funny one at that. And seeing that the comedy worked more than the drama, the producers went more and more in that direction as the show progressed.
""Popular"" touched on taboo subjects of sex, sexual harrassment, homosexuality, teenager's obsession with body image, and talked about these things with a sense of humor that disarmed it's audience.
During the series 2nd season, the show lost a bit of it's focus. I think that network meddling with the storylines and it's timeslot led to it's untimely demise. What makes matter's worst is that the show left it's audience with a dark cliffhanger that would never be resolved. Hopefully if there are strong DVD sales for the First Season, the cast would be able assemble for a reunion to tie up all the loose ends.
But the show's brilliant first season is what the fans have been waiting to see on DVD for years now. It was refreshing to see a show that did not have too much continuity, kind of like a live action version of ""The Simpsons"". The girls would get a mohawk one episode and the next episode had long hair again. It was funny.
The show also spawned 2 of TV's most memorable Mean Girls, Mary Cherry and Nicole Julian. Before Lindsay Lohan was tormented on the big screen by Rachel MacAdams, Leslie Grossman and Tammy Lynn Michaels were doing it to Carly Pope, Sara Rue, and Tamara Mello on a weekly basis.
You just gotta love a show where the southern belle Mary Cherry responds to a challenge to a fight after school by saying ""Bring it on Lilly, I know Tae-Bo"".

Saturated with scathing humor, pop culture references and social angst, ""Popular"" explored e-generation ambition and the teen crusade for popularity, acceptance and clear skin among the two girls and their feuding cliques.
In 2001, The WB unceremoniously truncated the show's two-year run after falsely leading the producers and fans to believe the show would be returning for another season.

Yes, its supposed be targeted at girls, but the material really rises above and resonates with everybody.  If you are a fan of GLEE you might want to check this show out. It's Ryan Murphy (Producer/Co-Creator of Glee) first show ever.  Some of the characters in this show are clearly early prototypes of future Glee characters.  The main story revolves around two girls; Popular and beautiful Brooke McQueen (Leslie Bibb) and social outcast/activist in training Samantha ""Sam"" McPherson (Carly Pope) who are on opposite ends of the social spectrum; and basically hate each other.  Their worlds collide when Brooke's single father marries Sam's single mother after meeting on a cruise.  The drama in the show focuses on the two girls changing personal lives after their parents marriage and the shockwaves that go through their social circle when these two girls become step-sisters.

While the show is quirky, irreverent and unafraid of discussing social issues; including sexuality, it is not a perfect show.  It has moments of utter cheesiness and can be very preachy at other times. The writing is uneven and a lot is left unresolved.  This was Ryan Murphy's first series and you can see in the writing his learning curve.  This show started off as a light and quirky satire of the WB shows it aired alongside, but eventually became less satire and more of a genuine teen soap it was mocking.  The strongest aspect of this show is the characters; all of them memorable in their own way; including the supporting cast who each shine in their own way.  The weakest part of this show is the writing, which is uneven.

Still, it's a good show and its good moments outweigh its bad.  Just be aware this show is very date, many of the references refer to popular culture from the 90's, some of the plotlines won't make sense today and the style of the writing and production techniques are very outdated/cliched in retrospect.",1420156800,,2004,4.790697674418604
