8759928,5,B01F0XMZ22,"I loved it! A dark, funny, and bizarre film about a boy getting home-schooled in an underground mansion whose parents have high goals for him: They want him to become President. If you love your movies whack, psychedelic, and thought-provoking, this is for you.

The Hollywood Reporter called it ""a dark fairytale"", Lodown Magazine ""the funniest, most unique, surreal, thought-provoking, absurd and overall rad movie hailing from Germany in the last decades"", and critic Alexandra Heller-Nicholas a film ""that is simultaneously both funny and tragic, Der Bunker is that rarest of treasures: a one-of-a-kind"".",1492560000,,608,5.468085106382978
8759929,1,B01F0XMZ22,"As an avid horror fan, I buy dozens of movies a month.  This was so disappointing!  Hard to believe, hard to follow, impossible to find anything at all good to say about it.  Onto the shelf it goes, never to be watched again.",1478217600,,225,4.186046511627907
