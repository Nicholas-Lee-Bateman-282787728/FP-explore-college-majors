4231364,4,B003YUBZ7A,"Wow. This really is something special - an object lesson in how to take familiar genre tropes and make them seem completely fresh. I knew nothing of the plot before seeing this and I recommend you do the same. Be warned, it's gruesome, but there's a welcome vein of jet black humour throughout and it is beautifully shot (blu-ray highly recommended). Here's hoping director Sean Byrne can pick up the horror auteur baton that Neil Marshall seems to have dropped and give us some more of this. Fantastic!",1288915200,25,503,4.7272727272727275

4231371,5,B003YUBZ7A,"I would highly recommend this movie to horror fans. It can be hard to find good ones, but this movie from 2012 is an absolute gem.

It's fun plot with a intriguingly understated and well acted cast of characters. The story builds gracefully, and what happens is disturbing yet satisfying in its unexpected brutality.

I cannot wait to watch The Devil's Candy made by this same director.",1497657600,,386,4.746268656716418

4231375,1,B003YUBZ7A,"I finally know what other people are feeling watching all the weird indy, arthouse black comedy and gory horror films that I love and extoll the virtues of. I wanted to like this film, but I could never find anything to grasp onto to that would make me comprehend it to feel a part of the film experience. I was an outsider all the way, and it wasn't pleasant.

The Loved Ones (no idea what the title means, sarcastic or otherwise) is about 30 minutes worth of story stretched into a very slow hour and fifteen minutes. The victim is mostly mute, contributing his mini-Momoa look of chiseled jaw, long flowing hair and rock-climbing physique to his underwritten role of silent sufferer. The villain is another crazed-chick-at-the-prom Carrie knockoff, complete with an insane parental figure who's in the script solely so writer/director Sean Byrne doesn't have to explain why the antagonist's deranged.

Add a hapdash  of background mope, an hour of torture that makes no practical or fanciful sense, some expected Australian desolate locations, and a generous sprinkling of glitter falling toward the camera in slo-mo, and scream, ""Voila!"" to suggest an appearance as if by magic! Yeah, Mr. Byrne, Good Films don't spring into life that way.",1493510400,2,1243,4.966346153846154
4231376,5,B003YUBZ7A,"As far as some movies go, The Loved Ones is one of those slasher films that goes to extremes as soon as the good stuff kicks in. The movie has a lot of flavors of torture porn and brat pack films from the 80's like mixing in Hostel, Pretty In Pink, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Sixteen Candles. The four mentioned films are mixed into a wild and demented cocktail of a movie like this one which really made my last movie night of 2016 last year. The violent scenes concerning Lola and her father torturing Brent are pretty vicious and intense. Overall, the movie is pretty good and very impressive for an indie film. In the end, The Loved Ones is a surprisingly morbid but original horror flick.",1492560000,,698,4.4186046511627906

The only good part was that the father and daughter became a little incestuous (just kind of emotionally, don't get all excited)-- because at least that is DIFFERENT from the ubiquitous, unending theme of gorily ripping people apart physically and psychologically.  You don't care about the plot do you?  If you like torture porn you'll watch it no matter what, if you don't you'll avoid it no matter what.  I suggest avoiding it-- but only if you hate extreme torture, giving people brain damage to turn them into human slaves, etc.",1464307200,,626,4.813084112149533

4231399,5,B003YUBZ7A,"This is a find fine midnight movie made by Sean Byrne and it is a pleanant surprise knowing that it is his first feature.
From the beginning the music was unique and made me liked the movie already.

The main charactor's girlfriend was really pretty and the main charactor was also charming that made me also liked the movie from the beginning.
But also the girl at the beginning approach the boy and asks to go to the prom together was paying my attention since she has this strange look and she is not pretty or has a beautiful body like the boy's girlfriend but something from the inside I think that made me kind of interested me.

All of a sudden this guy strikes the boys head and abducts his head and the real story begins.

Now the real deal is about this crazy girl and her father who has been doing this for years.
Because the girl who is kind of a loner, they have been abducting a bunch of boys that the girl kind of having an eye on and they take pictures, engrave heartmark on their chest with knife and torture them to death and end up with putting them into this ground floor and hunger them to death.

They even have photo book about them with newspaper about their articles.
Now for our main characor, since he refuses to bring him to prom, she wanted to have a fake prom with him.
He did all kinds of crazy torturment to him.
When he wanted to pee, she even make him pee by counting numbers any tells him if you don't make it in some 30 seconds, I will kill you or something.
He has to pee like crazy to survival.

The great thing about this movie is not a brutal torturment or sexual tension or a girl and her father's mean behavior.
It was the production design that make the girl's house look like a dream like place, a prom evening at the school that make the girl's heart beat.
The shinning ball like figure pointed by the light, the crazy girl's pink dress, the house filled with decorations, and all the other stuff that makes the enviorment that makes us feel like this house look like a fantasy world.
It makes this movie a true uniqe film.
The charactor alive and more lovable.

I cannot emphasise althoght it is a small part, the boy's girlfriend was a doll from this movie. She was pretty and sexy that made my heart beat.
Also she was befriend with the boy's mother who happened to lost her husband that we saw at the beginning from the movie that the husband and the son driving together and make an accident and instantly the husband dies.
It was the boy who was driving and there was this boy who was injured on the street not noticing the car coming. Later the boy found out that that boy was another vicim of the crazy girl.

You should check this movie out if you like midnight movie and this definaly will fufill your appetite at all.

 Ah, the director is an Austraian and he is now preparing a movie from Hollywood.",1463270400,,2856,4.274074074074074

Pot/Metal head Brent has his issues as does the Valentine family which develops later on. Robin McLeavy provides us with some odd passive demented sexuality in a good performance on an old genre.

4231418,5,B003YUBZ7A,"(this a review for the ""Rated"" version, for awhile it was next to near impossible to get a US region dvd, i finally got one at blockbuster, however, according to some reviews and the internet, i only missed about 24 seconds of extra gore)
I absolutely adore this movie. It pays some homage to classic horror films, while still remaining new and unique.
The plot is a well written revenge story, the side plot is a bit, overdone, in the end it serves a purpose, but not enough for it to be included.
The movie does a beautiful job of pulling on your heartstrings while also making you question yourself, that to me is good writing, when you have to detach yourself from something. The acting is phenomenal, not one performance made me remember ""oh this is a movie"".  The gore is done excellently, some people say that it's just torture prawns, but it's not, it has some really really gory stuff, but it has an excellent plot, so that takes it to a different level.
I'm incredibly impressed that it was written and directed by Sean Byrne, i've never really heard of him before this movie, but i'm surprised he isn't making more films.
All in all i completely loved it, my only problem is getting a US region bluray or dvd is a bit tricky/expensive. but well worth it!",1445731200,,1265,4.476190476190476

4231436,3,B003YUBZ7A,"Many films, now days,  can fall between 2 stars and 5 stars.  This is one of those.  It's got pretty good filming but not top of the line.  It appears that there wasn't an large budget but much more then a shoe string budget.  The characterization for the main cast was very positive.  The psychotic girl did a great job.  As her monster side reared its head  a charming composure seemed to encapsulate her.  That in and of itself is impressive.  She - and her dad-seemed to be the Australian, cousins of the Texas Chainsaw family.  When moments came to the edge, of ""Suspension of disbelief""; there was never enough to let me fall off the edge.  So... though  leaning toward cruel, sadistic, mean and violent, it never went beyond the levels of: ""The Evil Dead [1 or 2]"".
  ""The Loved Ones"" reminded me vey much of: ""Otis"".
  Trying not to give anything away:  This is a horror movie set in high school years.  In a town that has had some boys come up missing without any clues.  A girl that is considered a bit off wants to go to a high school dance with a guy that's already got a girl.  The girl- that's a bit off- gets help from her dad to get her date.  And that's where all of the problems begin.
  If you like horror comedies with the feel of: ""Otis"", ""Return of the Living Dead"", ""Dead-Alive"", and ""Killer Klowns from Outer Space"", then this is likely up your alley.  This is not a zombie movie!",1435881600,,1404,4.3076923076923075

The story was really good and I thought that the fact that you felt bad for the girl that was actually the villian was good. The actress did a great job playing her. I liked the hero as he was very likable and believable. The dad doing anything for his daughter was also a nice touch.

4231452,4,B003YUBZ7A,"Nasty high school horror that subverts hardwired viewer expectations. This Prom-Nightmare features another quiet, misunderstood teenage girl -- Lola -- but she's no Carrie. The sympathy felt for her early on -- when she is politely rejected after asking the boy she's been obsessed with to be her date for the prom -- soon evaporates. By the end of it, viewers will be cheering out loud for any grisly, vicious justice dispensed to Lola and her psychopathic father. The narrative power of this film is evident when viewers  eagerly anticipating the brutal death of a 16-year-old girl and her father.

Like almost every single film with a contemporary setting that I've watched recently -- especially in the horror, thriller and action genre -- it begins with a car crash (WRITERS: Do NOT use a car crash to strand your characters or establish a run of the mill tragedy in a character's past; in particular, fight the impulse to have the car lose control after swerving to avoid a bloody figure, or a ghostly woman, or a creepy kid, who then disappear. After vehicular collisions featured prominently in four consecutive movies, I went back through the list of recently viewed titles; almost half of the last 30 films set in the present-day featured car accidents, despite often being very well written). Learning how to drive with his dad in the passenger seat, a bloody figure stumbles onto the road; he swerves off the road and into a tree, and his father is killed.

The story picks up six months later. Brent, the protagonist, still trying to cope with the loss of his father, the guilt he feels over his role in the accident, and the fear that his mother blames him for her husbands death. Guilt has driven him to an atheistic variation of fundamentalist Catholic and Shi'ite self-flagellation, cutting himself using a razor blade hanging from a necklace. It has also driven him to flirt with death, on dangerous rock-climbs without rope at a local cliff-quarry. At school, we meet his best friend, who asks a beautiful but troubled Goth girl to go with him to the prom. It's interesting that there are several scenes that follow the couple's night at the prom, despite having no direct bearing -- and just a slight tangential bearing, that is revealed toward the end -- on the main storyline at all. Brent, meanwhile, having turned down Lola, meets up with his girlfriend after class, and they end up having sex in her parked car. Lola gives the viewer a hint of her crazy and creepy tendencies, watching the young couple f**k from just a few feet away, staring with a blank, unsettling expression.

Brent is kidnapped after his regular rock climb by Lola's father, who uses ether to knock him out. He awakens to find himself tied to chair that has been bolted to the floor. Around him are decorations for a pathetic prom. What follows is an utterly terrifying ordeal, as his voicebox is eaten away by an injection of bleach, and he is humiliated, tortured and mutilated. The way he fights, certain now that he wants to live -- whether it's for his girlfriend and his mother, or to survive long enough to kill Lola and her daddy -- makes for a tense and thrilling climax, and there are plenty of twists that tie in the earlier scenes in unexpected ways. Good endings are rare in horror, but 'The Loved Ones' is smart, exciting and satisfying all the way through.

Heapings of it preferably. While this film is well done, in a technical sense, the story is quite thin and did not build any tension for me. When a protagonist is so overpowered, the ""conflict"" is an abstraction, not visceral. His experience is so over the top that lacking adequate suspense/tension, it comes off borderline cartoonish. Its not at all believable- and I mean in a suspension of disbelief kinda way- so that I couldn't put myself in his POV at all and take a ride along with him. Alternately, the antagonists were so insane in an unbelievable way, I couldn't get into their POV either.

4231483,2,B003YUBZ7A,"I am a massive fan of the horror genre--especially horror movies. And I'm hardly a prude when it comes to twisted things being depicted in horror movies.  That wasn't the problem with this movie.  This movie is almost a textbook case on torture porn.  It has some very familiar elements from other horror movies.  And THAT is this movie's biggest problem--it retreads what other, better movies have done, creating an incredibly boring experience.

The plot of the THE LOVED ONES focuses on a deranged, obsessive girl who kidnaps a classmate after being refused as a date to a dance.  That is this character's entire motivation, and literally nothing else is revealed throughout the movie.  She had a crush on him...sort of...he refused her invitation, and she captured and tortured him.  While watching this movie, all I could think was ""Wow, MISERY did this so much better.""

Another issue: the main character is incredibly boring.  It's not necessarily the actor's fault. He's very wooden in the movie, but it's not really his fault as much as he has NOTHING to work with.  He's your cliched angsty teen main character.  But his whole motivation for being angsty is that he was driving and had a car accident and killed his dad--which is shown as the first scene of the movie.  That is literally it.  There are no other revelations about his character...he is just angsty, and then kidnapped, and that's it.  Oh, and his mom is now afraid of cars...and nothing comes of that either.

Meanwhile, there's this subplot with the main character's best friend, in which he asks out this cliched and suitably emo girl to the dance, and they have sex and stuff.  It keeps cutting away from the torture scenes to what the best friend is doing...but nothing comes of that either.  There's a very VERY minor revelation about who the emo girl is...or at least...why she's emo that ties back very vaguely to the main character, but their scenes could have been cut from the movie without doing anything at all to the narrative flow.

I don't mind that the villain is supposed to be deranged.  I don't necessarily mind that she's supposed to have a warped world view.  Annie Wilkes had a twisted view on morality.  But they revealed things about her over the course of the movie that create more of a picture of what made Annie the way she is.  Nothing is revealed about Lola (aka ""Princess""...seriously).  I think she's supposed to be a social outcast? Like, unpopular and bullied?  But there are only two scenes where other people talk about her. One is the scene in which she's turned down. The main character does that very politely.  The other is when the main character tells his girlfriend that she asked him to the prom.  The girlfriend makes fun of THE MAIN CHARACTER--calling him emotionally retarded.  That's it. No one every says anything mean about Lola.  It's baffling.

The movie is also tonally confused. There have been movies that have been made that mix the black humor and scares of horror well.  This is not one of them.  The funny scenes are played up ridiculous enough.  It's like...they don't know whether we should find Lola and her dad funny or creepy, so they try to do both at the same time, and it doesn't work.

The movie ultimately suffers from very weak characters.  With almost no build up or characterization, the torture scenes do not convey any scares at all because I did not care about the main character at all, nor did I care about the villain.  She wasn't written in a particularly entertaining way to make up for the lack of motivation, and so I watched the movie out of an obligation to at least finish it since I spent money on it.

HOWEVER...I don't want to ONLY bash this movie.  There is one aspect that I like.  I like that the torture happens to a boy at the hands of a girl.  These types of movies often involve men raping/torturing women, so it was nice to see her objectifying him, rather than the other way around.  Ultimately, that's the only compliment I can give.

This isn't the worst movie I've ever seen.  It's adequately produced, adequately acted, and the writing is perpetually cringe-inducing...just mostly so.  So, ultimately, what you have is an incredibly generic movie that brings nothing new to the table, and what it does bring isn't even particularly interestingly done.  Skip this, go look up the original STRAW DOGS, LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, MISERY, or PSYCHO if you would like to see the various elements of this movie done well.",1368316800,7,4489,4.691421254801536

4231488,5,B003YUBZ7A,"Nowadays, it can be hard to find a modern horror film that is both entertaining and fresh. Stale cliches and an overabundance of low budget dreck is littering movie queues and vending machines all over the world. But make no mistake, ""The Loved Ones"" is destined to become a cult classic. From the beginning of the film, it is apparent that it will not conform to the usual cliche (I mean, how many horror movies about torture and teen proms have been made the past four decades?). This film transcends the boundaries of the typical horror film; the torture scenes are brutal but not dark and depressing, making them even occasionally humorous. And this is all the more tolerable because this is not the kind of movie (as many modern horror films are) where everyone in the film is needlessly slaughtered.

What's even better is the fact that the acting is convincing and even at times superb; there are a number of still scenes with limited dialogue, removing the stale, banal one liners which can ruin films like this. The atmosphere is intense and memorable, and the dialogue is turned down in the mix, making this a truly haunting, brutal, and memorable little movie.

What, you've never heard of that one?  Well, in this case the ""princess"" is Lola, and if she doesn't get what she wants, she'll get it anyway, and her favorite instruments such as knives, a hammer, a power drill and rocks are used on her prince in brutal ways.

Lola is easily the best thing about this rather entertaining torture film. She is delightfully out of her mind and may make viewers look at prissy teenage girls differently for a while after watching The Loved Ones.  There are other good elements too, especially the other characters, who don't seem unlikable or unrealistic for the most part, a rarity for horror films like this.

There are a few things about the movie that seem a little...off, such as it seems weird that so many missing people in such a small town doesn't raise a suspicion.  Especially since Lola and her family don't really hide the fact that they're crazy and homicidal; a lot of their activities happen in broad daylight.  And you won't believe what they are able to keep in their basement.  Also, there are two characters that don't contribute anything of consequence to the film.  One of them is connected to the serial killings in a way, but it could have been explained without devoting so much screen time to her. Then again, without this padding, the film may not have lasted an hour.

The Loved Ones also features one of the most satisfying horror endings I've seen in a while.  I highly recommend fans of the genre to check it out.",1352851200,,1603,4.628975265017668
4231510,5,B003YUBZ7A,"I love horror movies but let's face it, sometimes the movies are just corny. Little to no story line, bad acting, the same story of 5 teens in a remote place, etc. This movie, however, was great!

A psychotic teenage girl, Lola, & her doting father don't like it when a boy rejects her. Dear Daddy spoils his daughter too much & makes sure Lola gets what she wants. There is more to the story though. Two families that have experienced great loss, a teenage boy who has given up but struggles to survive. There is a good storyline behind the gore & horror.

For those that love twisted movies with lots of blood, you have that too. It's not as bad as some I have seen but I did have to look away a couple times. There's one very brief sex scene with a small amount of nudity. It wasn't over done like in some horror movies.

This was a nice twist on a classic horror type movie. Great acting all around, good story line, and a lead character that will make boys scared to date! Highly recommend to anyone that loves horror!",1351900800,,1023,4.262886597938144

Only last week I realized that she is the same actress playing Eva, the woman with the tattooed face, in Hell on Wheels. So here she is in two different mediums being cast in two very different parts and showing a range that few actresses people follow on twitter are capable of expressing.  The Loved Ones is a great vehicle for her and she is magnificent in it.  It also helps that the film is well written and has great supporting players as well as good production values.

4231521,5,B003YUBZ7A,"The Australian horror thriller The Loved Ones (2009), takes you on dark hellacious journey, that includes some brutally violent and excruciatingly painful moments, as it uncompromisingly details a uniquely sick and radically twisted relationship, of a father and daughter.  This movie delivers the kind of stomach turning gore that may have gorehounds beaming with delight, and the squeamish averting their eyes, or gritting their teeth.  Some spoilers follow.

Swerving to avoid a bloody figure standing in the road, Brent Mitchell (Xavier Samuel) accidentally slams his car into a tree, killing his father who is a passenger.  Some six months later, it is the day of the school prom, and Brent is asked by shy Lola Stone (Robin McLeavy) to take her to the dance.  Already planning to attend with his girlfriend Holly (Victoria Thaine), Brent politely declines.  Brent's friend Jamie (Richard Wilson) does make a last minute connection, scoring a date with hot Goth chick Mia Valentine (Jessica McNamee).

Arriving home, Brett sneaks off and is smoking dope, when he is adducted, and taken to a house far out in the country.  Having already bought his daughter Lola a new dress, Daddy Stone (John Brumpton) now delivers Brett as her prom date.  With Brett tied to a chair, the family sits down to dinner, as a mirror ball spins overhead.  Also present is ""Bright Eyes"", an older woman (Anne Scott-Pendlebury) with a mean circular scar in her forehead.  Thus commences the prom date that Brett will never forget.

While there are some issues with the story, The Loved Ones still deserves high marks, because it has many different aspects, and it doesn't back away from nasty violence and sick subject matter, delivering big time in the gore department.  The violence is sometimes graphic, and other times more implied, but it is usually presented with a sense of style and extremely black humor.  Although Brett suffers several cruel and debilitating injuries, typically inflicted by household tools, his mind and body miraculously remain functional, so the impact of the violence isn't felt as strongly.

Although torture, pain, and suffering are major components, the film is about much more than Brett being a victim.  Feelings of guilt apparently produce some suicidal thoughts, but Brett develops a resolve to survive no matter what.  The creepy relationship between Lola and her father, adds a uniquely demented flavor to the movie.  Brett is just the most recent boy that Lola has taken a fancy to, and it becomes clear that what Lola wants, Daddy gets.  Lola's ""romances"" are brutal experiences that are shared with her father, who is her only ""true"" love"", and he guides her in everything.  The depravity is pushed to ridiculous lengths, when a secret compartment is revealed in the Stone home.  The situation is utilized quite well, and serves as a transition to the film's final bloody conflict on a deserted stretch of road, where Brett's girlfriend Holly becomes a critical player.

The movie also follows the prom night activities of Jamie and Mia, who know absolutely nothing about Brett's ordeal.  Theirs may not be a storybook experience, but it is infinitely more pleasant than Brett's.  The film has a pop music soundtrack, and although some of the songs may not be familiar to non-Australians, Kasey Chambers' poignant ""Not Pretty Enough"" proves to be an amazingly appropriate and haunting theme song for Lola Stone, still a little princess at heart, and waiting for the prince of her dreams.

The story has a nice wraparound element that features Brett swerving around someone in the road, at both the start and the finish of the film, and both incidents are connected to Lola.  While writer/director Sean Byrne's film debut has some missteps, the central thrust is strong and steady.  Bryne drew from various influences, including Carrie, Pretty In Pink, and the films of John Hughes.

The film features an outstanding cast that may be unfamiliar to non-Australians.  Robin McLeavy (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Abraham-Lincoln-Vampire-Hunter/dp/B005LAIHZE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter</a>), and Xavier Samuel (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Twilight-Saga-Eclipse/dp/B0042MDAL8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Twilight Saga: Eclipse</a>) are both terrific.  McLeavy was 28 at the time, and Samuel 26, but they both pass for high school kids.  Jessica McNamee, a regular on the Australian TV series Packed to the Rafters, was perhaps the most familiar among the cast, although her striking beauty may not be obvious playing Mia.  Veteran actor John Bumpton is a scene stealer as the wonderfully creepy, and dotting Daddy Stone.  His ruthlessness, is contrasted by his twisted feelings of affection for his precious ""princess"".

Now that The Loved Ones has been finally been released on Region 1 DVD, hopefully it will receive the recognition it rightfully deserves.  If you appreciate sick and twisted, give this one some serious consideration.",1348185600,,5078,5.401015228426396

4231523,4,B003YUBZ7A,"Brent is a teen suffering emotional scars from the death of his father from 6 months earlier. School is almost over and the 'End Of School Dance' approaches. But, Brent's life is about to go from one horror to another as he is targeted by the deranged Lola and her equally deranged father for a prom night of torment and torture. But, is torturing a tortured soul a good idea? What separates this from the recent torture porn sub-genre is that writer/director Sean Byrne crafts his horror with emotional depth and with some nicely and subtly intertwined story elements that I won't spoil here. His script is both straight to the point and subtle at the same time and not without some dark humor weaved in between the horror elements and the gruesome moments. He also fills the film with some very effectively designed shots to accent the intense and vicious goings on. There isn't a bad shot in the movie and the film looks great. Even the soundtrack is like another character in the film as the songs and music are very deliberately selected and placed for added emotional resonance. His cast members are all on target from Xavier Samuel as Brent, a wounded and guilt ridden teen who cuts himself but, suddenly discovers a will to survive when someone else is doing the cutting. Robin McLeavy gives a tour de force performance as the deranged Lola making her menacing but, not without letting a cuteness and sexiness through which makes her even more disturbing as she torments her 'date'. She gives her character a fiendish quality and never goes over the top enough for the character to become campy. She remains menacing even when going full tilt psycho for the chilling final act. John Brumpton is her equally disturbed father who will do anything to make his princess happy and his character is given just enough restraint to never upstage the rotten fruit of his deranged loins, Lola. The supporting cast all perform their roles with some nice emotional depth too, making everyone seem important to the story even before Byrne subtly lets us know why. A terrific, clever and fiendishly entertaining Aussie horror film and a very impressive debut from Sean Byrne.",1348099200,,2169,4.786666666666667

4231526,5,B003YUBZ7A,"Brent Mitchell accidentally killed his father by crashing into a tree in an effort to avoid a dazed, bloody figure in the road. His guilt throws him into a depression where he is constantly reminded of his mistake with his mother's mental breakdown. Marijuana and loud metal music are unsuccessful way of coping with the tragedy. The only light in his world is his girlfriend, Holly, who he plans to take to the prom. When Lola Stone, the quietest and most unassuming girl in school asks him to the prom, he nicely refuses, thinking nothing of it. Big mistake. The night of prom, he is knocked out and kidnapped. He wakes up in the prom night from hell, where a spoiled princess gets whatever she wants, even if it involves power drills, knives, and mutilation.

The Loved Ones is an odd, macabre film that fills me with delight. It combines the teen prom horror film and the twisted family horror with a feminine spin and some dark humor to make a unique, fun film. Lola Stone is a social outcast at school and her presence barely registers with classmates. The difference between her public and private persona is like night and day. She revels in the torture she inflicts on her victims with the help of her willing slave, Daddy. Lola is the most twisted spoiled child I've ever seen. She screams at and taunts her victims with Daddy and pouts when she doesn't get her way. Other than the gleeful torture, she's a normal teenage girl. Everything she owns is pink and sappy pop songs are all she listens to because she just wants a boyfriend. (I can never listen to Kasey Chamber's Not Pretty Enough, Lola's theme song, the same ever again after this movie.) Her normal teen behavior with her penchant for carving her initials on her victims' chest with a fork is odd and darkly comical. The scenes from her own personal prom are my favorite because the torture is only scratching the surface of this family's psychosis and I find Lola's special brand of crazy endearing. Robin McLeavy does an excellent job of portraying Lola's sadism, femininity, and childishness without making her unlikeable or annoying at all.

One of the things that sets The Loved Ones apart from others in the genre is how it shows the effects of Lola's actions in many different ways instead of just showing violence. Brent's whole life is thrown into chaos and misery because a boy that escaped her caused him to swerve and kill his father. The side plot with the depressed goth girl and Brent's friend going to the prom at first seems completely unnecessary. Near the end of the film, it becomes clear that the girl's brother was the victim that Brent avoided in the road, tying all the characters together and showing the huge circle of pain and grief created by Lola and Daddy.

The Loved Ones is the result of taking two genre tropes and adding an unlikely monster like Lola, pitch black humor, and the effects of the villains' actions outside of their torture chamber. The only flaw is that ending is a little too neat and convenient. This film is a pleasant surprise and a good addition to any horror collection.",1347580800,,3097,4.637522768670309

Here it is.  And given that the title and cover art do scant justice to the uber-disturbing contents, I almost passed on it.

Great performances, excellent pacing and staging.  It would be difficult to say more without spoiling the experience, so I'll just say that ""Loved"" is broken into three basic segments: a relaxed introduction to the characters that establishes their personalities and life situations and helps the viewer actually care what happens (something often missing from mainstream American horror movies, which tend to traffic in archetypes--see ""Cabin in the Woods"" to see ""why""); a dark, dark middle section that features white-knuckle jeopardy and torture; and...I can't say.  To lable the third segment would be to give too much away.

Oh, and not a moment of ""found footage"" to be seen, thank goodness.  Effective once or twice, the novelty of that approach has worn off.  ""Loved"" has good, third-person cinematography on actual film throughout.  And another horror film necessity--fleeting moments of comic relief that enable the tension to rise and fall.  This is not a great movie by ""Top 100 Films of All Times"" standards, but I defy anyone to come up with an example of a more effective horror tale this year.",1347408000,2,1595,5.522633744855967

His father is killed and the movie moves onto the 6 months later. The dork is now an emotionless stoner, and he is asked out by the shy-quiet girl to the dance, but he rejects her offer and informs her he is going with his girlfriend. This girl he rejects is not-so-shy after-all, as she has her own father kidnap the dork and bring her to her house to be her date for the prom. Whilst inside the house, the dork finds out this girl and her father are not normal, and quite insane. He fears for his life, pretty much emotionless as the girl and her father tie him up, torture him and make him attend the things of the prom they have set up in their own house. Will the dork survive?

While all this is going on, there are other scenes of the dorks mother and girlfriend trying to find him with the help of the local cop. But on the side, there is also a completely useless bunch of scenes of the dorks best friend and the cops daughter who attend the prom at the school and do drugs, drink, have sex and leave you wondering what the heck this has to do with any of the movie? It's just a stupid side story of dumb scenes that I think was an attempt to bring comedy the movie, but didn't manage to make me laugh once.

The other thing that made this film less enjoyable was the fact that the dorks girlfriend was ugly, and the psycho girl was way hotter. She could have found a date easily, but instead she wants the dork... he is so much of a dork he doesn't go for the hotter girl! If she was ugly and weird, you might swallow it more that she's daddy's little princess and he wants to get her a date for the prom because she's never been kissed of something, but no, she's stunning, could have her choice of many other guys, but I guess she just wanted this one and set up this weird home prom version for him.

Overall, it's not the worst movie I have ever seen, but I don't think I will ever have the urge to see it ever again. Rent it if you are interested, but I wouldn't recommend purchasing it.",1326412800,2,2244,4.095454545454546

4231537,4,B003YUBZ7A,"A darkly humorous slasher flick that takes a somewhat predictable genre and gives it an effective twist. Here the slashing is done by a maniacal father and daughter team. Daddy wants to protect his serially-rejected, sociopathic daughter, and together they've perfected an inventively sadistic revenge routine. The usual teen angst is ramped up by some heavy-duty guilt and loss but the film works best when it dishes out the grim laughs. The grief and guilt affecting the main teenage protagonists is sometimes laboured and might even be considered padding at times, but when the gore and grins kick in it works very well. Good performances too from an unfamiliar cast.",1322352000,,670,5.1

When I finally watched it, i loved it! Its not very gory and doesnt really have some deep storyline but for some reason it just really, really works. The acting is amazing and the soundtrack adds alot to the movie. I cant really say why its so good and I know that sounds kinda dumb, but this movie is a true gem. Ive watched Inside, A Serbian Film and Martyrs, and even though this movie is nowhere near as gory and graphic as those flicks, it ranks just as high in my opinion.",1320969600,2,647,3.9846153846153847

4231540,5,B003YUBZ7A,"As an Australian, I often have a reluctance to see Australian movies. My reason is that they are usually well made, well acted, well shot and well directed and for me utterly unappealing. This is not because of some anti-home brew sentiment, but because they are usually about depressing topics, with unattractive characters. Not true in all cases of course, but there seems to be in Australia a desire to make 'serious' films that are not much fun to watch. When Oz films have tried to step into the more Hollywood style of film (such as Cut), it has often been a mistake and a seeming lack of understanding about the genre.

(Slight spoiler ahead)

Not so The Loved Ones! Apparently this tanked at the box office, which is a terrible shame, because it's a pretty cool little video-nasty type film. It sets up the leads very well and makes you invest in them and their problems and the villains, well, they are quite horrible! Torture porn isn't usually my thing, but the fun of this film is watching the victim/hero escape and get revenge (as in Hostel). The implications of what these utterly awful people want to do the lead character and have made a practice of doing to many other victims in the past is truly horrifying. Trust me, you really want these villains DEAD by the end of the film!

So hopefully The Loved Ones will make its money back on dvd sales and hire and its film makers won't get jacked off with Australia and go off overseas to make films there. Although, for their own benefit, maybe they should!",1302220800,2,1522,4.547445255474453
4231541,2,B003YUBZ7A,"Really no need to take a corny b-movie this seriously, but since everyone else is i'll jump on.
The main problem with the villain's unique psychology being the centrepiece of the film is that it's not that unique or even consistent, with random transitions from an innocuous childlike mental state (to derive chills from her apparent ignorance of morality) to full self-awareness (to derive chills from her taunting) ruining the premise that any shred of depth in this horror setup hinged on.",1301443200,,492,5.012195121951219
4231542,3,B003YUBZ7A,"The Loved Ones (Sean Byrne, 2009)

Torture porn is a played-out genre, but the thing about played-out genres is that there are always directors around who want to try and drag them back into the spotlight for one more go. (How many romantic comedies were released last week? How many of them were actually good?) Every once in a while, someone manages to hit the spot, even. While The Loved Ones has its share of problems, and you may well consider some of them showstoppers, it's probably best torture-porn flick since Turistas.

We start off with a paper-thin plot: high-school bad boy Brent (Xavier Samuel, who exploded into the public consciousness immediately after this by getting cast in Eclipse) is asked to the end-of-year class dance (basically, the prom, if you're American) by Lola (48 Shades' Robin McLeavy). Brent turns her down, because after all, he has a long-time girlfriend, Holly (Son of the Mask's Victoria Thaine). Maybe he could have let her down a touch more gently, but man, Lola doesn't take rejection well...

While there's a bit more to this (there's a comedic subplot involving Brent's best friend and his dance date, the younger sister of the only victim to ever escape Lola, as well as some... interesting... dynamics in Lola's family--wait'll you meet Mom, played by Australian TV stalwart Anne Scott-Pendlebury), that's what it boils down to, and so the film is carried by Samuel and McLeavy. The fact that Samuel was cast in the Twilight franchise based on the strength of his performance in this film should tell you all you need to know; McLeavy hasn't hit the big time yet, but it's only a matter of time. Her character is never really given any motivation other than ""man, my whole family is messed up"", but she does a good mentally-disturbed. (And anyone seeing this movie will never, ever hear Kasey Chambers' ""Not Pretty Enough"" the same way again. Ever.)

Byrne, doing his first writing job and directing his first fictional feature (he was a co-director on the documentary The Secret in 2006 and has done a number of shorts) makes some first-timer mistakes, many of them covered above. He also can't resist the show-the-monster moment, though it's not a case of showing the monster, really... oh, I can't explain without a bunch of spoilers, but there's a plot twist about three-quarters of the way through the movie that really defuses what was a tense piece of concept. Still, as far as the simple mechanics of the thing go, this is a movie that shows that Byrne has potential. As a movie itself, it's obviously a vertical-market property, but off the to of my head I can't think of a better torture-porn flick to have ever come out of Australia. For that matter, the last decent Australian horror movie I remember came out twenty years before this (Dead Calm), so I'm willing to cut it a little slack and tell you to go ahead and rent it. ***",1297209600,3,2888,4.747011952191235

I found this one on a few 2010 ""Best Of"" Horror movie lists, so I thought I'd check it out.  Let's just say I hope it makes it's way to America!!!  The woman who plays Lola plays the role of the ""weird"" girl very well.  She doesn't take kindly to rejection (even of the polite persuasion), and decides to get even.  She and her Pops do some nasty stuff to their victims.  I also appreciated (as I'm sure most of you can) that the movie took off and got exciting quickly.  Some absolutely brutal + original torture scenes.  Wow, just thinking of them makes me recall how truly sadistic and evil Lola's character is.

I don't give the flick 5 stars for 2 reasons:  The mystery is ""solved"" rather easily.  Come on.  No one would have immediately guessed he had been kidnapped by Lola + Pops.  Secondly, the ending.  I'm OK w/ ""Hollywood"" happy endings, but in my opinion they rushed the ending.  Not much tension throughout the last 10 minutes or so.  It was never really a suprise what would eventually happen.

If you can find this somewhere, check it out.  I'm not sure if it will be released in America, but if/when it does, hit the theatres ASAP.",1295827200,7,1170,4.38785046728972

However, the motive behind his abduction is unlike any I've seen before!

One of those ingredients is a bizarrely different, and engrossing story. It also has a cast of interesting characters who have actual emotions!

OMG, there were many times I did the whole cover my eyes while peeking through thing, because my imagination picked up where the crazy girl barely stopped. I was pleasantly surprised with this movie just as I was with Wolf Creek. These Aussie's have fantastic follow through. This movie is definitely packed with gore and more gore.

If you are looking for a realistic story line, this is probably not the one for you however, I feel safe saying, we definitely do have this degree of crazy in the world today.
