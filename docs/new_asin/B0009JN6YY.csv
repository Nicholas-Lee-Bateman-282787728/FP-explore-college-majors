8061985,1,B0009JN6YY,"I bought this entire series and not one of the DVDs will play on my machines.  I have tried them on two DVD players and on my computer and all they do is freeze.  This is too bad because the instructor, GM Chun Sik Kim, is very good and it would have been nice to see how he does his forms.

8061986,1,B0009JN6YY,"I puschased both volume one and two.  Neither volume will play in either of our DVD players.  The picture freezes while audio proceeds, then the picture leaps ahead.  The DVD playback is so choppy they are unusable.  They will only play in the DVD rom drive of my home computer.",1230508800,4,278,4.5
