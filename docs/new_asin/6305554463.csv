1056756,2,6305554463,"""Demented Death Farm Massacre"" sounds far more interesting than it is. What is interesting is the way that Fred Olen Ray bought an existing, if unwatchable, 1972 film named ""Shantytown Honeymoon"" about city slicker criminals getting trapped in a house with deep south hillbillies and re-edited it with new footage to make a nasty little horror mlange. Ray, the master of miniscule budgets, hired John Carradine for a morning's work to read garbage lines that form a kind of framing device and plot continuity narration at fairly random intervals. I would like to report that Carradine's work was up to his usual level of quality, but in all honesty this is one of the worst Carradine appearances I have ever seen. The footage matching between Carradine and the rest of the film is jarring to say the least, but what were you really expecting from a Troma DVD with a title like this?

The film opens with Carradine ranting and some hillbilly digital nasal canal mucus removal (this is one of the vilest nose picking scenes I can recall in any film.) After Carradine's rant (he's in essence a linking device to the plot, already in progress) we are introduced to one of the main characters, Harlan Craven (George Ellis) the nosepicker in charge of moonshine operations confronting a prostitute in one of the worst-acted scenes in all cinema history. It's at this point that most viewers will be wishing fervently for the pacing and artistic integrity of any Coleman Francis film, but I am afraid you will be out of luck for about 90 more minutes. As if the acting wasn't mind-numbing enough, the movie unceremoniously dumps four wholly unlikeable New York jewel thieves into the hillbilly camp when their Jeep runs out of ""petrol"" (or so intones pointlessly-accented Phillip; Jim Peck.) The resulting dialogue is beyond excruciating and it develops that the only likeable character in the entire film is Reba Sue (Ashley Brooks,) Harlan's young, pretty, and nave wife. (Or is she?) After a voyeurism scene that fails on absolutely all levels, we get a random cut of Carradine blurting out ""The love of money is the root of all evil!"" Then right back to the film; these interruptions maximize Ray's investment in Carradine as the ""star"" of the film, despite his onscreen time being miniscule. There is tawdry romance and a deadly catfight (I won't tell you who gets killed by the moonshine jug, just that you'll be grateful to have the herd thinned out a bit.)

Not to give away all the good parts, I will summarize the remainder of the film by saying that there is a lot of banjo music, a ton of walking around in the woods, a failing explanation of what diamonds are to ber-dense Reba Sue, a ridiculous double-cross, and the onscreen debut of the old ""Is that a real gun?"" pitchfork-impalement ploy. If all this sounds terribly exciting, prepare to be disappointed as this is one of the most plodding of all Carradine films, which is saying something. I am totally serious when I say that ""Red Zone Cuba"" is in every way a more lucid, well-crafted, and energetically-paced Carradine movie than ""Demented Death Farm Massacre."" A note on the massacre part: the gore is minimal and extremely hokey. Mercifully after 91 minutes it's over with Carradine once again intoning irrelevant platitudes, and the relief is palpable.

There is one extra, a trailer, which is a more than adequate plot summation for most people. Rarely have I seen such a mess: the acting is absolutely wretched, the plot is ridiculous, the horror scenes aren't scary, the entire cast (excepting Reba Sue) is utterly loathsome, and the editing is simply unreal. So why did I give it two stars? It's kind of a touchstone for bad movies, and particularly for bad editing. I know Ray didn't have much to work with here, and given his source material I am confident he did as well and anyone could have reasonably expected. Having said that, the crazy patchwork of scenes with Carradine as a righteous windbag oracle is difficult to take for even the most battle-tested bad movie aficianados.",1375574400,4,4055,4.814921090387374

Despite it's misleading title, this is a boring as hell and not very interesting low budget horror movie that was originally ""Shanytown Honeymoon"" but then in 1986 when Fred Ray Olen re-issued it from Troma under the title ""Demented Death Farm Massacre"" and inserted footage of John Cariddean as a narrator in some scenes.

1056760,2,6305554463,"Fred Olen Ray was a little-known producer of low-budget schlock-movies in the 70's and 80's. Today, he's, well, still unknown. But Ray deserves a niche' in the history of independent film-making of that era. Make it a tiny niche'.Here's a chance to see horror film icon John Carradine in a near final, if not totally  curious, starring role. If you can call it that. ""Demented Death Farm Massacre(1986)"" is a 16mm, amazing color compilation of non-drama, B-movie regurgitation, and frankly, I don't know what. The only thing more odd than this movie is the history of it's production. ""Demented Death Farm Massacre""'s opening scene shows John Carradine standing on a darkened backyard set, with a fence and bushes in front of him. He proclaims: ""I am the judge of Hell. I see the evil men do. Some people think that they can get away with murder. But are they? Let's see if Judge Death can help them on their way to hell."" ""Death Farm"" is set in the hillbilly part of the Carolina mountains. As a jeep with two men and two women drive throught the countryside, a radio is blaring a news report that tells us that the police are looking for four New York thieves who robbed $1 million worth of gems. The four are headed to Florida, but suddenly the jeep stops. ""It appears that we are out of petrol"" states Phillip, the gangleader. The four come across the home of moonshiner Harlan and his new and near jail-bait bride(in a fetching bare-legged skirt). When Harlan discovers that they are the thieves, he and his bride are overpowered, and the thieves soon  decide that they want the hidden fortune that Harlan has made from his moonshine business. The murder and mayhem that follows is framed in pasty, red, Hollywood blood. The actors are pretty bad, and the screenplay is mostly talk, talk, talk. And yet, ""Death Farm"" has a totally on-location earthiness that's hard to describe. In a sex scene that's half rape and half seduction, it manages to show a topless woman in various poses, without much in the way of actual nudity. In 1985, producer Fred Olen Ray bought an old movie called ""Shantytown Honeymoon(1971)"" from Jeffrey Hogue. It was directed by Donn Davison. He could only view the last color-faded reel, but that was enough. He bought the picture for $5500, and retitled it ""Demented Death Farm Massacre"", and made a new master from the negative. Intending it as a straight-to-video, Continental Video said they would buy the U.S. rights for $15,000 if he could put John Carradine into the film. He did. Ray planned to re-shoot the titles, and insert John Carradine, his old friend, into new, added scenes. On December 14, 1985, Ray hired Carradine for the entire day, for $2400. His part would only take an hour to shoot, so Ray wrote up a series of additional scenes to shoot that would provide him enough footage to make three more John Carradine movies. He planned to use one scene for the future ""Star Slammer"", which he did, and another scene for ""Frankenstein's Brain"", which was never made. Other footage(about two minutes) was with Carradine as Judge Death, and was editted into ""Death Farm'. Other footage wound-up in ""Jack-O"", in 1995. By then, John Carradine had been dead for seven years. In ""Death Farm"", Ray cuts in shots of Carradine intoning: ""Love of money is the root of all evil. The lust that comes with wealth is the lust of death!"". In the finale, Carradine proclaims: ""Well, I see things turned out as planned. The evil were punished and the good rewarded. I like a happy ending, don't you?"". The Carradine footage was shot at Movie Tech in Hollywood. Fred Olen Ray said later: ""Carradine was reading from cue-cards, but I think he knew that different scenes were for different films. He was called a doctor in one, and a judge in another. We finished at three o'clock. Seven A.M. till three o'clock. I can tell you what Carradine had that day, because he had the same thing for lunch that he had for breakfast: a Spanish omelet. He always had a Spanish omelet!"".",1249084800,4,4001,4.698005698005698

7892624,5,6305554463,"On one hand it's disappointing a movie that goes by the REALLY appealing name ""Demented Death Farm Massacre"" and even features narration of a creepy old man (John Carradine) doesn't live up to an actual massacre... but on the other the movie's a fantastic unintentional comedy!

John Carradine begins the movie with the following-

""I am the Judge of Hell.  I seek the evil and wrong that men do.  Not everyone is lucky enough to get my attention but if you do, I don't believe you'll live to enjoy it.  Look, there is some men and women with blood on their hands.  They think they're getting away with murder, but are they?  Let's see if Judge Death can help them on their way to Hell!""

The movie's about a group of four jewel thieves who drive out to the country to escape.  They stole millions worth of diamonds.  You have the smart guy who plans how they're going to get away, his unintelligent partner and two attractive, but dimwitted women.  They come up with a plan to ditch the jeep and walk through the woods.  They want to find a place to stay and lay low for a while.  Hilarious the way they walk through the woods for several minutes in the most dramatic way ever courtesy of the soundtrack.  This scene is WAY too long, and too much!  They stumble upon a wife hanging clothes outside (played by Ashley Brookes) and her woman hating husband (George Ellis).  He treats his wife like crap and thinks any woman coming onto him is sinning.  The wife takes in the four jewel thieves while the husband's away.

This movie has humor all over the place but I'm not sure how much of it is intentional.  The two attractive women want to get a shower.  The wife recommends jumping in a lake outside.  What's hilarious is that the women get confused when the wife says the toilet's out back but the shower's in the kitchen, lol.  The wife is actually just as dimwitted as the two thieves, and you'll see why later!  This certainly isn't a movie that's very nice towards women.  It's also not a nice movie towards southerners.  When the husband comes home, he's not very bright either. He mentions he found a jeep on the way home which belongs to the jewel thieves obviously since they were trying to ditch and cover the jeep up, but since the jeep was covered in branches George thinks it belongs to him.

Soon George and Ashley are making breakfast in the kitchen and with the radio on they hear the news that four jewel thieves are on the loose, and describe the men and women in their home.  George recommends keeping this a secret but... it's too late.  The one jewel thief overhears this, walks in with a gun and holds the two hostage.  Later Ashley and one of the female jewel thieves get into a fight after it's discovered the one unintelligent jewel thief guy had sex with Ashley.  She of course got really upset (since the two are supposed to be a couple despite the girl getting smacked around) and the fight is on!  It's funny the two women are grabbing each other on the floor and fighting but yet, no punches are actually thrown.  Instead suddenly Ashley picks up a heavy object and repeatedly smacks it into the woman, and kills her.  We went from very mild violence to the extreme just like that!

Some of the writing is really good though.  Not even in the hilarious fashion.  For example when the planner of the jewel thieves comes up with an idea.  If the cops were to find and arrest the jewel thieves, they'll just say the wife and husband of the house actually held THEM hostage and thus killed Karen (the jewel thief involved in the fight with Ashley).  Even though I pick on the other jewel thief guy for being unintelligent, he comes up with a good idea as well.  He recommends following George around and even getting involved in the moonshining business.  That way they can keep an eye on him.  They often make fun of southerners in this movie and it comes across as harsh often times.

Another hilarious moment happens during the car chase at the end.  The second jewel thief girl gets run over (I think) and the smart one is the only remaining member alive.  When George and his friend run out of gas, his friend says ""You know that gas we put in the jeep yesterday?"" George replies ""Yeah?""  ""Well I don't think we should've!""  Meaning they're stranded on the side of the road and a crazy guy with a gun is after them!  I love the writing so much!  And George... LOL!  He's such a liar.  When his friend gets caught in a bear trap he's actually shot and killed by the jewel thief, but after George eliminates the jewel thief he returns home to his wife and brags how he tried to rescue his friend when really he was a coward who ran away.

George does nothing but treats his wife like total crap.  Then again she's not very bright and thinks diamonds are shiny glass.  He refuses to be touched by his wife and considers it sinful.  One of the jewel thieves believes George is actually cheating on his wife even though we don't see anything that would lead to such a belief.  Oh and this jewel thief is part of another hilarious moment!  The unintelligent jewel thief pulls a gun on George when George refuses to go along with his plans.  George says ""Is that a gun?"" and the jewel thief replies ""No, it's an ice cream cone!""  Soon after this George grabs the gun, throw it to his friend and during the chaos the jewel thief finds a pitchfork in his throat!

John Carradine provides narration for the entire movie.  He makes appearances from time to time, but never has as much to say as he does in the beginning.  ""The love of money is the root of all evil.  The lust that comes with wealth is the lust of death"", ""I say onto you that he who looks upon a woman with lust in his heart has sinned already"", ""He who lives by the sword shall perish by the sword"", ""The wages of sin is death"", ""The Lord giveth and the Lord taketh away"", ""Well I see things turned out as planned.  The evil had punished and the good rewarded.  I like a happy ending, don't you?""

There's a ridiculous amount of humor in this movie.  Trust me, a lot!  The acting's amazing, the story's really good, but the atmosphere and horror elements don't exist.  The ending has a little bit of a twist involving a realization the wife has after taking advice from one of the jewel thieves, and it's quality writing.  I won't spoil it though.
