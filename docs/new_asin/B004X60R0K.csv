8446265,5,B004X60R0K,"I really enjoyed this dvd. A lot of people say Hulk and Eric were the reason TNA almost went out of business. I think it's fair to say that considering how things were when they left. The company was close to being sold. I liked the first couple years of Hulk's time there that this dvd covers. As soon as things turned into Aces and Eights I flipped the channel for good never coming back. One of the main reasons that kept me watching TNA over the years was Sting. So it just showed how bad it got that it became unwatchable.

  During this dvd we see Hulk and Eric take control away from Dixie and create Immortal and team it with with Ric Flair's fortune. I thought it was an exciting time for wrestling. January 4th 2010 we had a reboot of the Monday Night Wars. It was short lived but that first show was so much fun. TNA went all out to compete with WWE. RVD, Jeff Hardy, Scott Hall, Kevin Nash, Ric Flair, Ken Anderson were some big names that would help TNA. The inclusion of guys like The Nastys, Morley, Jordan and other guys that were the Hulkster's buddies were not needed as TNA needed to focus on building their own young talent up.

  One of the matches on here is Sting vs Jeff Jarrett from Sacrifice. Sting turning heel was a gutsy move. It's very hard for Sting to be heel it failed in WCW in 99 when he turned against Hogan then. People just love Sting. Sting put TNA on the map and I thought he did his best to be a heel. I give Hulk credit for turning Sting heel they had to try something. You have to take risks to succeed but that that was a failed idea that didn't work out. Sting returns as a face to defeat the heel Jeff Hardy for the world title in a match to close out the dvd that was an awesome match. Hardy and Sting are a dream match from different generations of wrestling. It's like The Rock vs John Cena. Sting won in a great match one of the best parts of the dvd.

  Speaking of Jeff Hardy The Bound For Glory 10-10-10 match he had with Angle and Anderson was a five star match. It was another risk in turning Hardy heel. RVD said it was a mistake to turn Jeff heel. I have my mixed feelings about it. It was different and they were looking to shock people and get people to tune in for something new. Hardy as a bad guy played his role well and I think overall it was the right move to make even though that was another mistake as it didn't work out.

  There is a match with Hulkster and Abyss vs Flair and Styles. That was a good match and always great to see Hulk and Flair in the ring. I think the storyline of Hulk trying to push Abyss into a superstar was a bad idea if anything he should have tried to further push Styles as the next mega star of wrestling since he had been the franchise of TNA since 2002. He could be comparable to John Cena. Instead he didn't work out paired with Flair and Styles had the belt taken off him and given to RVD fairly quickly then just faded out rapidly as it was similiar to when Christian Cage joined TNA Styles took a backseat. I do think it was the right move to give RVD the title. He was a huge star and could carry a company. He should have had several WWE title runs in WWE but he didn't TNA was good for him and he was good for TNA. Perhaps Styles could have been given a longer title run.

  Mr. Anderson wins the title in a match on this dvd Genesis 2011. Mr. Anderson had some great matches and thought initially when he stepped in TNA he had a great run and proved to be a major player. I think he deserved to be champ and TNA was a great opportunity for him. I don't think he was as big a star as he was made out to be. I wouldn't put him in the same sentence as The Rock. His matches with Sting, Kurt Angle and Hardy were great. I just never saw Anderson as the long term answer but he was a good player just not great.

  There is also a match on here Rhino vs Abyss back when they were doing The ECW angle. I think that was a good idea. ECW fans are very faithful and in the early days of TNA many ECW stars like Raven, Jerry Lynn, Sabu, Sandman, Justin Credible and Rhino appeared on TNA and got their shots there as they were looking for work and TNA was building new young stars like AJ Styles. Guys like Raven helped TNA grow and bring in more viewers so there would always be a section of viewers dedicated to ECW. But TNA should have focused on the now and not tried to relive the success of the past because this is a different time for wrestling. They need to focus on their young stars.

  Best example of a mistake made by The Hulkster and TNA. They buried one of their greatest wrestlers in Samoa Joe. I feel like Joe should have been in the main event picture. I feel Christopher Daniels should have got a world title run. I feel like AJ Styles should have been used better.

  In the end I love this dvd because 2010 was an exciting year for TNA. I loved seeing Scott Hall, Kevin Nash and Sean Waltman back in wrestling for a brief time that year. I loved seeing Ric Flair in TNA that year and thought he did great in both his wrestling and non wrestling role. Having both RVD and Jeff Hardy come into TNA at the same time was exciting because we got two major stars who could bring TNA to the next level. Ken Anderson was another name. We got a new Sting. Then of course there was Hulk Hogan. I love Hogan though things went wrong and never worked out it was great to see him in TNA. Hulk Hogan is the greatest wrestler of all time and always will be for what he did for the business. Though he can be attributed to the fall of WCW and TNA wrestling wouldn't be here today without him. There would be no TNA. Though Hulk lead partly to the demise of WCW he was the one that turned it around in 1996 when he changed wrestling for the second time in history.

  I love this dvd and love the time period it was made in. For me being a hardcore fan of the 90s it was great to see wrestling try to create a legit company to go against WWE and the jumps of many major wrestling stars from WWE to TNA made me feel like it was 1995 again and Lex Luger is showing up on Nitro. Those times are over though for now. I guess I would recommend this to loyal true blue TNA fans and wrestling fans who are fans of Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair and RVD.  But to some this will be a frustrating dvd to watch because it was start of the fall of TNA before they were able to rebound and stay in business. I think though the Hogan Era failed TNA fans will be happy to know its going on two years since Hogan left TNA and TNA has rebounded and is staying in business and TNA will be in business for a long time.

8446266,2,B004X60R0K,"Before I write this review, I want to give you something to chew on this for a second. You've got two of the biggest names in wrestling history (Hogan & Flair), an arguable wrestling genius in Bischoff, well known legends like Sting, Angle, Booker T, & Foley, two wrestlers who probably have the biggest fan followings in the last two decades in RVD & Jeff Hardy. Add to it the TNA originals who bust there butts off like Styles, Samoa Joe, Daniels, Beer Money, etc who put on a good show night in & night out to make TNA grow into a bigger brand. This looks like a recipe for success that is ready to take over the WWE. Nope, this success has almost bankrupt the company & rumors are the company might be sold soon. So what went wrong with TNA? I hate to blame the Hulkster & Bischoff but you watch this & you'll see what I mean. It sickens me to watch this dvd because it just shows how it all went wrong. He took away the six sided ring & put the x-division on the back burner. This is probably my least favorite dvd from TNA Wrestling. Now that Hogan & Bischoff gone & TNA in ruins, I hope they can recover & go back to the six sided ring. I don't want to see this company go under but if they do then this could be called The Death of TNA.",1384992000,,1244,4.060975609756097
8446267,4,B004X60R0K,"The TNA immortal dvd was good for someone like me, who missed the whole first run of this storyline on cable TV. Being able to watch the whole thing (at least to where the time of the story at the end of the dvd stops) was easier than sittting though week after week of the TNA show. The only thing is, they are doing all the interviews in kayfabe which is weird in a world where we are used to all the shoot interviews of today. Check it out if you have free time.",1369958400,,465,3.9574468085106385
8446268,1,B004X60R0K,"I was actually stoked (if that word is still being used) to get this dvd. A documentary all about Immortal taking over TNA? What a concept! Unfortunately it was a fail.

As far as value goes it's long. There's about 2 hours worth of matches, making the documentary portion about 4 hours. But this was nothing more than a shockumentary of interviews from the wrestlers personas. There's little tid-bits here and there of real stuff (such as TNA trying to be live on monday nights to compete with raw only to switch back to being taped for thursdays) but it's all b.s. simply for entertainment purposes. This covers from the announcement that Hulk Hogan was coming to TNA all the way to the March 3rd episode of 2011 when Hulk got full control of TNA. Which if you've been watching TNA recently, the story continues and Dixie gets the company back, so it's not even the whole story.

There's lots of TNA Impact footage to help explain everything, so if you haven't been watching throughout 2010 then this is the dvd for you. But it was sad to watch because there's lots of censorship and bleeping out words, where as on the original episodes it's not censored. Which made it feel watered down.

There's already lists of matches on the other reviews so I'm not going to go into them, and if you don't own these matches then this dvd might be worth your money just for the matches alone. But if you're like me, who already owns every tna PPV dvd over the last few years, it's not worth it.

All in all I was let down.",1326931200,,1513,4.431654676258993
8446269,5,B004X60R0K,I love Hulk Hogan. End of story. He is amazing and I will watch him and buy his merchandise until the day I die. I also love Ric Flair and Sting and all the Old School Wrestlers. Even Buschoff. This is a great DVD and I highly recommend it.,1317859200,2,240,3.9183673469387754
8446270,4,B004X60R0K,"Ever since the announcement in 2009 that Hulk Hogan was coming to TNA Wrestling, nothing has been the same since as he promised change & that's exactly what we got but only a small few saw the type of change he would bring to TNA & that's all chronicled here in ""Immortal Forever?""  Along with a selection of matches, we get the story of what happened from the moment Hulk Hogan announced he was coming to TNA all the way to the infamous date of ""10-10-10"", the hostile takeover & formation of Immortal to Sting making his return to TNA.  You'll hear throughout the documentary from the various names involved including Hulk Hogan, Eric Bischoff, Dixie Carter, Ric Flair, Sting, Jeff & Karen Angle, Abyss, Bully Ray, Matt Hardy, Rob Terry, A.J. Styles, Kazarian, and Beer Money.  It should also be mentioned that during the interviews, they censor the references to WWE related properties of WCW, WWE, or ECW.

The documentary begins with highlights & discussion about the Madison Square Garden press conference where Hogan announced his partnership with TNA & Dixie Carter before showing the talent meeting Dixie Carter with all the talent in the Impact Zone.  Hogan's debut night in the Impact Zone is talked about with the other debuts that night of Ric Flair & Jeff Hardy with Dixie talking about the significance of Hogan & Bischoff ""ripping up the format"" for the match that night.  The issues with Jeff Jarrett were talked about next dating back to WCW Bash At The Beach 2000 & Jarrett attacking Hogan in Japan before going into the change from a six sided ring to a four sided ring with footage of how the fans reacted to it at Genesis & A.J. Styles completely burying the idea of the change.  Abyss was discussed next talking about how he was lost with no direction & the importance of Hogan's Hall Of Fame ring before going into A.J. Styles' alliance with Ric Flair & later briefly discussing the formation of Fortune.  The move to Monday nights was heavily discussed with Dixie talking about the major differences in television today than how it was back then during the ""Monday Night War"" & how this idea was being thrown around before Hogan & Bischoff came into the company before showing highlights of that night such as Rob Van Dam's debut.  The discussion turned to Sting talking about his issues with Hogan dating back to WCW, the reasoning behind his cryptic messages to Dixie, and showing his first face to face confrontation with Hogan on Impact.  The transformation of Abyss was heavily discussed next with Abyss going crazy after a match on Impact & the confrontation with Hogan next week revealing ""THEY"" are telling him what to do before shoving the ring down Hogan's throat along with why Dixie dismissed the whole ""THEY"" prophecy at first with Bischoff explaining the entire plan behind ""THEY.""  EV2 was talked about next with Dixie explaining what she meant behind her comment comparing the ECW Originals to Hulk Hogan & reasoning of giving them their own PPV while Hogan gives his point of view behind the whole situation before showing the highlights of Fortune attacking EV2 the Impact after Hardcore Justice & Abyss talking about why he took out Rob Van Dam.  Setting up the hostile takeover was heavily showcased here with Hogan & Bischoff overturning Dixie's decisions such as Ric Flair's suspension along with the entire setup behind Dixie signing the company over to Hogan & Bischoff with comments from everyone involved with the formation of Immortal.  Dixie's injunction on Hogan was shown next along with the fallout of that with Bischoff pushing the importance of Immortal needing all the championships before going into Crimson warning that ""THEY"" are coming for Immortal, the return of Scott Steiner, and Fortune breaking away on their own with both sides commenting about them leaving the group.  The final moments of Hardy regaining the championship from Mr. Anderson is shown before showing footage of Impact in North Carolina where Hogan came back to TNA after winning his court case against Dixie before ""the network"" got involved forcing Jeff Hardy to defend the championship against their selected opponent...Sting with the documentary ending on everyone talking about what's in the future for themselves, Immortal, and Impact Wrestling.

Complete Matches Include:
Hulk Hogan & Abyss vs. Ric Flair & A.J. Styles - This was originally planned to be the first match of the night but after a few minutes, Sting appeared only to attack Hogan & Abyss with Flair & Styles joining in leaving Hogan a bloody mess causing Hogan to have the match rescheduled for later in the night under ""no disqualification"" rules.  Hogan's head is bandaged from the assault by Sting earlier & starts out with Flair brawling on the floor leading to Flair being opened up.  Flair tried chopping & punching Hogan to no avail with Hogan returning everything Flair gave him & went as far as to whip Flair with his weight belt in the ring.  Flair had to resort to dirty tactics to gain some offense tagging in A.J. Styles who reopened the cut from earlier & beat on Hogan in front of his daughter Brooke building up to the hot tag to Abyss.  This was a fun back & forth match that was entertaining with the aftermath being full of complete chaos with appearances from Desmond Wolfe, D'Angelo Dinero, and the return of Jeff Hardy.

[TNA's Greatest Moments]

Lethal Lockdown - Team Hogan vs. Team Flair: Abyss, Jeff Jarrett, Jeff Hardy, Rob Van Dam vs. Sting, Desmond Wolfe, Beer Money - For those who haven't seen a Lethal Lockdown match, it's held under the same rules which the old WCW/NWA match of War Games where under. One man from each team starts the match and after a period of time, another member from one team (which in this case was Team Hogan due to RVD winning the match earlier) enters and after each time period, the teams alternate sending members in. Once all team members enter the cage, the roof containing all the weapons is lowered onto the cage and the only way to win is by pinfall or submission. Unfortunately, this turned out to be my least favorite Lethal Lockdown match since the very first one back in 2005 was as there wasn't much that stood out during the match past Abyss starting the match with an injured hip from being hit by a car on Impact (you read that right) against Robert Roode & Desmond Wolfe going after Abyss' Hall Of Fame ring. From there, the action in the ring with everyone was completely ignored & forgotten about as Jeff Hardy came out (after Sting prevented him to appearing sooner) & going completely crazy with a kendo stick on the outside with Beer Money before taking it to the roof of the cage & putting James Storm through a table. From there, the action in the ring completely stopped (as if time stood still) as Flair entered the match to take Abyss' ring followed by Hogan & Bischoff getting in the ring and had their own little brawl with Flair bleeding before Abyss got the pin. This match went from being a normal Lethal Lockdown match before everyone in the ring (including Sting of all people) was forgotten about, the focus got put completely on Jeff Hardy (who never entered the ring for the record) and after his stunt, it became the Hogan/Flair/Bischoff show. This Lethal Lockdown match was bad but it was definitely my least favorite since the first one 5 years earlier.
LockDown '10

Jeff Jarrett vs. Sting - This was one of those ""put a storyline over"" segments more than an actual match as Sting just beat down & bloodied Jeff Jarrett from the backstage area all the way down to the ring to the point where he left a big spot of Jarrett's blood on Mike Tenay's format sheet at the broadcast booth. Sting used his bat & the ringside steps to injure Jeff's shoulder before eventually getting the win & warning Jarrett about playing the ""deception game"" with the rest of ""them.""
Sacrifice '10

Falls Count Anywhere Match: Rhino vs. Abyss - EV2 member Rhino was out for revenge against Abyss for the attacks he did on fellow EV2 members Rob Van Dam & Stevie Richards. They started fighting on the ramp to the backstage area with a cameraman getting knocked out in the process. While fighting at the bottom of the stage, Abyss was thrown through the stage wall & brawled with Rhino underneath the stage (with another cameraman getting knocked out in the process) before Rhino was thrown through the wall on the other side of the stage. Back in the ring, weapons like a cookie sheet & a trashcan were used while both men were able to kick out of each others signature's moves before the guardrail from the outside was the deciding factor in the finish. This was a very fun match to watch & if you enjoy this match, be sure to look up their other Falls Count Anywhere match from Against All Odds 2006.
No Surrender '10

TNA World Championship Match: Kurt Angle vs. Jeff Hardy vs. Mr. Anderson - This was one of those triple threat matches that was non-stop action with each men having their moments to look strong with such moments like both Angle & Hardy going after Anderson early, Kurt Angle german suplexing both men at the same time while later applying an single anklelock to both men, Angle injuring his ribs via a samoan roll from Anderson off the top rope followed by a Hardy swanton bomb on both men, and Angle delivering a top rope Angle Slam. The big story here was the appearance of Eric Bischoff with a chair looking to hit someone with it before Hulk Hogan made his first appearance in weeks coming down the ramp & getting in the ring on crutches looking ready to fight Bischoff who took one of the crutches before Hardy intervened & took the crutch from Hogan...to nail Kurt Angle with it & hit Anderson with the other one causing Hardy to pin Anderson. From there, Jeff Jarrett & Abyss came down to the ring to celebrate with Hogan & Bischoff & Hardy when RVD made his way down only for Hardy to nail him with the championship. Abyss' words rang true as ""THEY"" arrived on 10-10-10.
Bound For Glory '10

TNA Champion Jeff Hardy vs. Mr. Anderson - Right after Anderson beat Matt Morgan to become the #1 contender for the title, Eric Bischoff announced that the title match would happen now obviously showing that they wanted to get Anderson out of the way after he was already spent. Hardy came out in his street clothes (tie included) smoking a cigarette & tried to pick the bones by just beating on Anderson trying to get an easy pin with Anderson constantly kicking out. After an overload of appearances & interference, this match served it's purpose with Anderson overcoming the odds to become the new TNA Champion with the bigger picture being Immortal winning all the championships only to lose the biggest one at the end of the night.
Genesis '11

TNA Champion Jeff Hardy vs. Sting - Sting came into this match with more motivation & aggression than we've seen from him in over a year as he was in control from the very start & even caught Jeff in the scorpion deathlock early causing Hardy to favor his leg.  Jeff was overwhelmed & he tried to walk away only for Sting to catch him & suplex him on the ramp.  Hardy caught a break when Sting missed a stinger splash on the outside railing but that didn't stop Sting as he delivered three separate Scorpion Deathdrops (including one with Hardy hanging from the top rope) to dominate his way to another TNA Championship reign.
""Impact"" Mar. '11

In the end, this was a nice look at the storyline of Hogan & Bischoff taking over the company from Dixie Carter going into details of how everything was setup for months & the fallout of it.  You can't capture each & every single storyline involving Immortal during that time (nothing was said about The Pope's alliance with Sting & Nash or Jarrett turning on Samoa Joe) but they did a good job capturing the important moments while each of the matches were quality in their own right so this is something I would recommend for a viewing.",1311120000,3,11955,4.657969639468691
