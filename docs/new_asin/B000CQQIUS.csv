8100582,5,B000CQQIUS,What can we say?  We just love Pat Cooper.  He is a real treat listening to and now watching on DVD.,1457654400,,100,3.7142857142857144
8100583,5,B000CQQIUS,I  watched  this  almost  forty  years  ago  on  cable  TV  [in  1977]  plus  i  loved  it.  It  was  fun  to  see  again  especially  after  all  these  years.  My  only  complaint  is  Mr  Cooper  uses  the  word  'g-dam'  too  much.  Why  does  Mr  Cooper  do  this?  He  is  so  unbelievably  talented  with  his  extraordinarily  quick  wit  and  his  superb  impersonations.  Why  does  Mr  Cooper  need  to  use  foul  language?  Mr  Jackie  Mason  and  other  famous  comedians  are  in  the  same  rowboat.  Why  must  the  super-talented  Pat  Cooper  and  other  talented  comedians  use  dirty  language?,1441238400,,616,4.645161290322581

8100586,3,B000CQQIUS,"I bought ""On Location With Pat Cooper"" because of how much I loved ""Pat Cooper, You're Always Yelling"" (see my review for ""Pat Cooper, You're Always Yelling"").  My first impression was that this dvd was more ""dated"" than ""...Yelling"".  Also, much of Cooper's material on this dvd is also on ...""Yelling"" and the little there was that was different on this dvd was really not as funny perhaps because it is so dated.  Buy ""On Location with Pat Cooper"" only if you are a Pat Cooper fan like me who just can't get enough of his extremely funny comedic genius of growing up and being Italian.",1221436800,2,588,4.528301886792453
