-Creative moves and work out.
I love how different this work out feels. It uses a stability ball, low step, med ball, and weights. It uses them all in a creative way with lots of balance work, so it makes you feel like you are lifting more than the 8 pounds it calls for as your heavy weights. It's a nice work out to change things up if you are tired of The Firm, or the repetition of other work outs.

-Pikes?
I LOVE the core work in this. The pikes and drawing your legs in on the ball is a challenge but I think its fun.

-Intense cardio
I might be a wimp, but I do work out 6 to 7 times a week, but I find this to be the hardest cardio video I own. I'm HEAVING after the step routine in the middle with the med ball. I sweat buckets, and am gasping for air. I can make it through vol. 3 of The Firm, and The Firm Cardio just fine, but this really gets me. I enjoy it cause I hate running but need to add more cardio in to my work outs.

Dislikes
-The set and production quality
The production quality is similar to that of the original FitPrimes... aka terrible. Looks like it's filmed in a garage.

-Cueing
This work out is one you have to do about three times to really get. Also it helps if you've done all the TLT videos before doing this. A lot of the moves are the same, so they won't seem as weird if you've tried them before. Bonnie has really terrible set up and cueing though. She fails to mention simple things like ""get your box now"" or even which side to do. It's not bad though once you've run through it. Just don't give up after the first time through.

Those are my only complaints. Give it a try if you can find it. It's hard to come by. I'm still trying to find some of the TLP work outs my self. If you get the chance though, get this one for sure.",1228348800,2,1810,3.958791208791209
8012731,5,B0001HYDCI,"This workout was one of three original volumes released by Tracie Long during her first post-Firm solo venture, Tracie Long Productions (TLP).  All of the TLP videos focus on functional fitness, or training your body to move the same way it does in every day life; furthermore, many of the moves have an athletic feel to them.  This particular workout consists of both strength and cardio intervals, and it is led by Bonnie Geer.  Equipment used includes a low step, light and heavy dumbbells, a medicine ball (I used 4#), and a stability ball.

Bonnie begins the workout with a 6-minute warm-up using light weights (the only other time I've seen weights used for the warm-up is in Jari Love's videos).  The moves are very different from the usual aerobic warm-up and include ""functional"" (shorter) lunges performed in a clock-like fashion and combined with controlled punches.  All of the stretches are dynamic, including a kick/rear lunge series and an inside kick/squat series; there is also a squat/hamstring stretch (dead lift) sequence.  After the warm-up comes the first cardio segment which uses both the medicine ball and the step.  The section is fun, with upbeat music and moves such as chugs, l-step, v-step, and plyo jacks.

The strength work starts next:  the first segment uses the stability ball for back work (rows and supermans), and the following segment continues with the stability ball for pec flyes, glute squeezes, russian rolls (for abs), ribcage pullovers, and push-ups with legs on the ball.  Standing strength work follows using medium to heavy weights.  This section starts with a Statue of Liberty exercise (also seen in one of Tracie's newer videos, Strength in Movement) adding one-legged and then a full dead lift and finishing with a lift onto the toes combined with a v-reach.  In-between sides, there is a fun cardio series that consists of side lunges off the step while passing the ball back and forth; this segment also includes rear lunges and kicks.  You then repeat the Statue of Liberty series on the other side before moving into what Bonnie calls the ""matrix"":  hop forward from side-to-side with fast hops to move back.  This is combined with front lunge/knee lift and side lunge/overhead lift.  Additional lunges are included in the strength segment which comes next, this time a side lunge with knee lift as well as bicep curls.

Up until this point, all of the above segments (with the exception of the warm-up) are featured on the TLP compilation video, The Whole Shebang, which I own, but the last cardio and strength segments were new to me and just as fun.  For the cardio, Bonnie again uses the medicine ball for a side-to-side squat, eventually adding a rear leg extension and a side overhead reach.  The cardio also includes rear cross-back steps, plyo jacks (slow and fast), and a tick-tock move.  The final strength segment includes more side lunges, this time with a single-arm row and then a straight-arm lift; it ends with a 1-legged squat that includes arm and torso rotation.  Core work follows, including arm roll-outs and tucks/pikes on the stability ball and then side plank work on the floor.  The workout finishes with a quick (3.5 minute) stretch which mainly addresses the shoulders, quads, and hip flexors.

Overall, I really enjoyed this workout; one of the best things about it was that the 43 minutes FLEW by.  I also found the segments to be fun and enjoyable, both the ones that I was familiar with already (ie, the ones included on TWS) as well as the ones that were new to me.  With keeping my weights relatively light, I felt like I got a great full-body workout, and I usually feel some soreness in my glutes in particular the next day.  Although I do like Bonnie as an instructor--she is quite serious and no-nonsense--I do find her cueing difficult to follow at times.  Not only does she often fail to break down the move ahead of time (ie, she just jumps right in and expects you to follow along), but also she usually cues while performing the move rather than to give you any advanced notice.  Still, I like this workout better than one of the others in the series, Dynamic Strength & Power, as I found the exercises to be more fun and the impact work to be less exhausting (I haven't tried the third video in the series, Core Foundations).

In summary, I give this workout 4 1/2 stars, and I would recommend it to those who enjoy unique exercises, like cardio/strength circuits, like working with the stability ball for cardio, are familiar with functional fitness and like Tracie Long's style, and finally, who don't mind having to go through the workout several times to learn the unfamiliar moves.  Personally, I'm sure that this quick, efficient, and fun workout will have a regular role in my fitness rotation.",1197417600,5,4801,4.818292682926829
8012732,5,B0001HYDCI,"You can never go wrong with the people behind these videos. They are ideal for someone who wants an effective, interesting, and cutting -edge workout.
I recommend this and the whole series VERY highly!",1080432000,,201,4.9411764705882355
8012733,5,B0001HYDCI,I did this workout this morning and really enjoyed it. I felt like I got a great workout in 45min. The exercises were innovative and challenging. Bonnie is wonderful throughout. I can't wait to see the results! Once again Tracie delivered a great workout!,1078704000,,255,4.818181818181818
8012734,5,B0001HYDCI,"From cardio, to strength training to balance work, this workout does it all in just under 45 minutes.  And it's FUN!  Bonnie pumps up my heart, then brings it back down with strength work.  New and imaginitive moves at a quick pace that also incorporate a stability ball left me feeling worked!  There is certainly no boredom here!  This one too, focuses on core training to a much larger extent than any other workouts I've done.  I love it!",1078617600,8,442,4.531645569620253
8012735,5,B0001HYDCI,"Knowing that Tracie Long was involved with this I had to have it.  Of course it is fantastic!  What a great work out.  I can't believe I can feel like I have done my cardio and total body in just 45 minutes.  I am going to be so hot looking,  and so is anyone else who does it.",1078444800,3,277,3.706896551724138
8012736,5,B0001HYDCI,"I've done this workout 4 times and am feeling tremendous results already! I'd consider myself an advanced exerciser (been at it with home videos since Firm's Vol. 1), and I've found this 45 minute workout to be a wonderful challenge. The ""functional"" part of the title is very appropriate - you're training your body to do things you do in everyday life, but learning to do those things with good form. Bonnie is a gem on camera and she does a great job teaching all the very innovative moves in this workout. There is some really tough glute/hamstring work, lots of attention to the shoulder/upper back area, and a focus on core stability throughout. Modifications are offered for those newer to this type of exercise. I see this workout having a PROMINENT position in my weekly rotation.",1078185600,7,789,4.766423357664234
