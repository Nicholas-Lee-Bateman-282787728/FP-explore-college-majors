2012753,1,B0001KNHQI,"Absolute garbage.
Pure '80s cheese.

The actors were delivering their lines as if the sooner they got through them the sooner they could go home and put this disaster behind them.

Waste of time and more importantly a HUGE waste of server space.

2012754,4,B0001KNHQI,"I got this because I was curious about Roddy McDowell in a sci-fi film. It turns out it was very interesting and it's what a friend of mine calls ""a keeper"". Many of the newer movies are flashy effects but this had a good story as well as pretty good effect.",1375142400,,258,4.078431372549019
2012755,4,B0001KNHQI,"The best way I can describe this is, that this movie takes elements from other movies and combines it down to something that as a low budget sci-fi film stand quite well.

The basic premise is that like in the film ""Leviathan"" our cast of characters works on an underwater mining station who are rushing to meet quota before their shift is over and they get leave. They receive a distress call from a nearby Russian station, when they go to investigate they find the corpses of several crew members have been drained of their bodily fluids, they stumble upon two surviors one running in fear of the other, with the other crew member ranting and carrying a gun and saying that something is inside him etc a la ""The Thing"".

The crew brings the lone Russian survivor back to their station...take a guess what happened to the one with the gun...where he is quarantined and full battery of tests is conducted on him to see how and why he survived what for all intents and purposes they believe to be a viral outbreak. What we come to discover is that the Russians, who were mining as well came across an alien in hibernation deep underground and that is managed to reawaken and attacked the crew.

Of course now this alien has a new set of hosts on which to gorge itself while the survivors try to figure out just who is infected and who isn't. There are a few twists with this movie but nothing that we haven't seen in other movies of this type. I mean this movie was made in 1995 so I mean you can sort of see that this movie is really just an amalgam of ""Leviathan"" 1989, ""The Thing"" 1982, ""Alien"" 1979/1986.

It isn't a bad movie, but not the greatest, still there are a few twists here and there that made it enjoyable if you can get past the obvious plot points taken from other better know science fiction films of the 80s and 90s.",1355097600,,1834,4.353801169590644
2012756,5,B0001KNHQI,"At the start of the movie I was afraid that it would really suck, however moving further into it I really loved it.  There were a lot of concepts in this movie that were from other movies and even complete dialogue rip-offs from movies such as ""The thing"", however their usage in the movie was rather awkward and adds to the hilarity.

Definitely worth the watch =D",1294444800,,365,4.432835820895522
2012757,5,B0001KNHQI,"That's what I have to say about this one. It's fun to watch if only to see Roddy McDowell and Shatner's daughter in this film. It also stars the first Mr. Fantastic, Alex Hyde-White, from the Corman unreleased Fantastic Four movie. Also appearing in this quick sci fi movie is the Richard Biggs, the doctor on Babylon 5. It's fun to watch the low budget version of alien here. It even has an andriod character that's very much like Data in Next Generation.  I have to say it's a keeper because it has so many familiar faces in it.",1100563200,3,530,4.353535353535354

8014122,3,B0001KNHQI,"This film takes place in 2020, after mankind has messed up the planet.  The crew of an undersea mining company is stuck with an unwelcomed visitor (Melanie Shatner as Catherine) there to check on how the operation is going, something to do with productivity.  There is a mining accident, poor Louis (Don Stroud) is injured, the resident doctor is blamed (Roddy McDowall as Dr. Lazarus).  Why the doctor was mining instead of running sickbay is anyones guess.  The place is overseen by a psychotic megalomaniac (Alex Hyde-White as Pickett).  The director told Hyde-White to act macho and he got confused and decided to act crazy instead.  A neighboring Russian operation puts out a distress call; they answer it, and bring onboard a tricky alien capable of turning its hosts into puppets, easily manipulated.  They must devise a test to figure out who has the organism.  Sound familiar?  This movie borrows heavily from many sources.  Besides a lousy transfer, the plot is deficient, the acting (apart from McDowall, the only professional onboard) is substandard (one of the characters/actors does imitations!!!), the sets are almost adequate, the FX is great if you like sock puppet aliens............

This is one of those very bad but amusing sci-fi flicks.  I found it hilariously awful but still entertaining.  But its definitely not something Id put on my resume!",1484438400,,1368,5.0807174887892375

8014124,2,B0001KNHQI,"The original title ""Alien Within"" warned you that this was a poorly scripted ""Alien"" ripoff film. An underwater mining company while aiding Russian minors contract an ancient virus and a laughable looking.alien parasite. While the year is 2020 the scientific advances look like something on ""Star Trek"" including an android that can take a pulse. It is a mining ship building that has its own self destruct program, because...in case aliens take over?

I was mostly distracted by four tubes filled with bubbling colored water. It had that certain ""Lava Lamp"" stoner appeal, although I have no ideal what they could have been used for, sort of like half the stuff on the ""Seaview."" MST quality film.

8014125,2,B0001KNHQI,"I wanted to enjoy this, I really did.  Well, I didn't. Here come the bullet points. Low budget which is ok with me but this is cheesy bad low budget. Anything with Don Stroud I should just pass by. Dumb characters very clich. So predictable. Cheap and badly acted by all concerned. Roddy tries but can't do a thing, horrible fight scenes. Really avoid this. Bad attempt to make a combination of ""alien"" and ""the Thing"" Get those instead. Run away from this sludge pot.",1411430400,,468,4.5058823529411764
8014126,1,B0001KNHQI,"Unknown Origin (Scott P. Levy, 1995)

I watched Unknown Origin immediately after finishing the excellently stupid Irish monster movie Grabbers, which in no small part redeemed itself because at no point did it ever take itself seriously. It's not the most original movie in the world, but it celebrates that fact. Unknown Origin gets everything wrong that Grabbers got right; it is an obvious, painful ripoff of the much-superior The Thing (the '82 Carpenter remix) and Alien, but never even nods in their directions. Worse, it takes itself as seriously as cancer. This movie probably had ten times Grabbers' budget, but I've no idea where it went; it looks like it was made for three cases of beer and ten bucks on borrowed equipment and stock that had been thrown away for being years past its expiration date. If the actors worked for scale, the production company should sue them for fraud. As for Scott Levy (whose next feature was another rip-off of exactly this sort called Piranhas)? Somehow, he got away with it, and kept directing all the way up until the dawn of the new millennium. I am reasonably certain that if I never see another Scott Levy film, my life will be much the better for it.

Unknown Origin, also released under the more-obvious-ripoff title The Alien Within, centers around an undersea mining city overseen by Jedidiah Pickett (Pretty Woman's Alex Hyde-White), who looks like the kind of guy who would rather be out in the action than administering things from behind a desk. They receive a distress call from another of the company's undersea mining rigs, and Pickett, along with the city's doctor, Henry Lazarus (The Poseidon Adventure's Roddy McDowall, slumming it) and a couple of other crew members, head for the other city. They discover it has been torn to shreds. The only survivor is out of his mind and has to be sedated. At least, they thinkhe's the only survivor, but if you've seen The Thing, you know he's not, and soon the crew are getting paranoid around one another and trying to devise a test to discover who's infected and who isn't.

I spent half this movie laughing at it and the other half of it wondering how in the flying Poughkeepsie the casting director convinced Roddy McDowall that he needed to appear in this monstrosity. Blackmail may have been involved. He is, as usual, a slight bright spot in the otherwise ridiculous proceedings, but let's face itthis is a seventy-five minute movie where seventy-three minutes could have easily been (and should have easily been) left on the cutting-room floor. A couple of clips of McDowell pontificating and a couple others of Sha-Ri Pendleton glowering would have been all that survived, and it would have been better than this.

Aka ""The Alien Within"" (1995) TV movie was really cheap in production and acting.  Even of you know the story, sometime the execution can be fun; this one is jejune. If you must watch this keep your finger on the fast forward button as you will not miss anything.",1388275200,,487,4.4

Now, a parasitic organism is out to enter and possess the crew. It wants to a-sexually reproduce don'cha know! UNKNOWN ORIGIN is another of Roger Corman's ALIEN clones, this time under-water w/ some of THE THING and LEVIATHAN tossed in.
