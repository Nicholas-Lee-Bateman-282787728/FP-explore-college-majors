5551738,5,B002OOWL98,Thank you so much for releasing the 3rd season of Different Strokes to DVD. I've been waiting for this for years!! Please release seasons 4 - 8 now. I would buy every season if you do. Please please and thank you so much again for bringing season 3 of this classic show back into my life!! :D,1342656000,5,292,4.140350877192983
5551739,5,B002OOWL98,"Yes! Season 3 has finally been released! Recieved my dvd today! When I was a kid this was my favorite sitcome & season 3 & 4 were my favorite seasons, the show still holds up, it's sad the personal lives of the stars has effected the shows recent success, because despite their personal lives behind the scenes, for the viewer,, the show taught so many positive & safety lessons & on top of that the show was straight lol funny, looking forward to seeing more of this timeless classic cause as far as I'm concerned this show should be on heavy rotation like I Love Lucy & Andy Griffith.",1342569600,2,586,4.385321100917431
5551740,5,B002OOWL98,Finally a 3rd season disc comes out!  I have every episode recorded from TV but just isn't the same. I can ditch the custom discs I created.  I hope seasons 4 through 8 come out in shorter time period increments to catch up with the 6 year gap since season 2 was put out. Thank you SOOOO much!!!!,1342310400,6,296,4.086206896551724
5551741,5,B002OOWL98,"FINALLY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! After 6 looooooong years since Season 2 came out they are FINALLY putting another season out of this awesome classic 80's show. I have NO idea what takes these studios so long to put these out when more obsucre, less popular shows already have full season sets and complete series sets out there. I am part of a growing number of parents with elementary and teen children that are tired of all the raunchy, overly sexualized junk that is being constantly exposed to our children on television.  It's wonderful to have access to good, clean, fun television prgramming! Let's thank Shout Factory for taking this one under their wing and let's hope they bring it to its full completion of the full 8 season run.  Now THAT's WHAT I'm TALKIN' BOUT WILLIS!!!!!!!",1334620800,18,779,4.849624060150376

5551785,5,B002OOWL98,"I mean the above title to be of utmost sincerity, as Arnold, Willis & Kimberly begin to hit puberty during Season Three of ""Diff'rent Strokes"". This season, the children experience growing pains, as Willis becomes seriously interested in girls, Arnold becomes concerned about his height & Kimberly prefers dating older men. One of the funniest episodes this season is ""Junk Food Junkie"", where Arnold develops a fetish for edible items that do a body bad. Arnold becomes depressed when he learns he won't grow to be much taller than his prescribed height in the episode ""Count Your Blessings"". There are lots of great episodes & laughs in this third season of ""DS"". Gary Coleman, Dana Plato & Todd Bridges have matured in their respective roles, & Conrad Bain's Mr. Drummond is just as provincial & warm-hearted as ever. This season marks Nedra Volz's first full season as housekeeper Adelaide Brubaker. Volz's character is a nice addition to the Drummond family, as her sassy wit & charm wins everybody over - myself included. ""Diff'rent Strokes - The Complete Third Season"" is sure to be a hit in your all-important DVD collection for everyone in your family, so pick it up ASAP!

5551798,5,B002OOWL98,"Season 3 of the huge 80s comedy hit Diff'rent Strokes features another 22 episodes spread over three discs. Originally screened in the USA in late 1980 and early 1981.
Lovong the show as a child in the early 80s, I cannot remember any of the episodes on this set, but I do recall seeing Kimberly (Dana Plato) in the opening titles parading down the stairs in her pink outfit.
The child stars of this show have had incredibly bad luck since the show ended in 1986 with the deaths of Gary Coleman (Arnold) and Dana Plato. Todd Bridges (Willis) has also had a bad run with being charged with murder, dealing in drugs and countless run-ins with the police. Not much is known of Canadian Conrad Bain (Phil Drummond) since leaving the show, but according to wikipedia, he's still with us.
The episodes on this set are
The Bank Job (1)
The Bank Job (2)
Small Claims Court
Substitute Mother
The Accident (1)
The Accident (2)
Little Mother
Football Father
First Love
Count Your Blessings
The Loan
Roots
Junk Food Junkie (aka Junk Food)
The Bus
The Older Man
Where There's Hope
The Magician (aka It's Magic)
Drummond's Fair Lady
The Ancestors
Almost American
Room for One More
The Athlete

Take a trip down Memory Lane and watch this set. If you've never seen the show, well you're in for a treat!",1349308800,3,1287,4.547413793103448
5551799,5,B002OOWL98,"This is one of those shows that was very popular when I was growing up, and I liked it and watched it all the time.  I've seen it in reruns many times over the years, so I wasn't in a rush to buy the dvds.  The first season is probably my least favorite, although there are good episodes that I like in that one too.  This is one of those shows that I think got better as it got into the second and third seasons.

Some memorable episodes, and some of my favorites, of the series are in this season:  the bank robbery; when Arnold is addicted to junk food; Mr. Drummond getting amnesia; Arnold meeting Cathy.  There are also some guest appearances from a few of the girls from The Facts of Life-Natalie, Tootie, and Blair.

I hope more seasons of Diff'rent Strokes are released.  I'd like to even see the Sam years again.",1348876800,2,821,4.251612903225807
5551800,4,B002OOWL98,"DIFFERENT STROKES was an awesome sitcom that ran from 1978-85 on NBC and then briefly on ABC from 1985-86, but was an instant smash when it premiered on NBC in the Fall of 1978 about 2 African American boys from Harlem who were adopted by a rich white Park Avenue businessman named Philip Drummond(Conrad Bain) and his daughter Kimberly for whom the boys deceased mother used to work for.

This 1980-81 Season of DIFFERENT STROKES was an awesome season that was even more upgraded than its first 2 seasons, despite the fact that this season still kept us mourning the loss of their first housekeeper Mrs. Edna Garrett(Charlotte Rae)whom left DIFFERENT STROKES in the Spring of 1979 to do her own spinoff series THE FACTS OF LIFE which debuted on NBC in the Fall of 1979 when DIFFERENT STROKES kicked off its 2nd Season when Mrs. Garrett got replaced by housekeeper Adelaide Brubaker(Nedra Volz).

also made stars out of child actors Gary Coleman(Arnold Jackson), Todd Bridges(Willis Jackson), and Dana Plato(Kimberly Drummond)whom all became known for the ""very special episodes"" pertaining to serious issues like racism, illegal drug use, and child sexual abuse were dramatically explored on this sitcom throughout its whole 8-year run.

Unfortunately the lives of Coleman, Bridges, and Plato were later hammered by legal troubles and drug addictions as their fame and success they achieved while doing this show went downhill when DIFFERENT STROKES was cancelled in March of 1986.

As a matter of fact, Dana Plato was fired from the show in the Spring of 1984 for drug abuse at the end of DIFFERENT STROKES 6th Season as they ratings on the show started to slump prompting producers to make changes to help improve the ratings by adding recently divorced aerobics instructor Maggie McKinney(Dixie Carter)and Maggie's son Sam McKinney(Danny Cooksey)to add new ideas to the show in order to help boost the ratings back up.

Unfortunately, the additions of Maggie and Sam did nothing to improve the ratings which resulted in NBC cancelling the show in the Summer of 1985 before ABC had revived the series with an 8th Season in the Fall of 1985 which resulted in an even bigger slump in the ratings which contributed to ABC cancelling DIFFERENT STROKES in the Spring of 1986 after only 19 episodes.

This show also takes me back to memory lane to when DIFFERENT STROKES was shown on NBC every Wednesday night at 8PM preceeding THE FACTS OF LIFE at 8:30 PM followed by QUINCY, M.E. at 9PM and to when Ronald Reagan was the president and we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had from 1981-1982.",1344902400,4,2613,4.873873873873874

I'm not speaking for myself I'm not deaf but I know some people who are and who would have been glad to be able to watch the show on DVD too...
