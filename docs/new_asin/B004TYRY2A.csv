His films are true originals and he explores the hidden sides of human nature very effectively and provocatively. Thank goodness here is a director who forces one to THINK. Not the weak of stomach, but certainly always thought-provoking and in this stultified world no mean feat in my opinion. Enjoy the work of this highly original author!",1441670400,,447,4.973333333333334
