8112771,3,B000EQ5UIM,"SHIRLEY TEMPLE STORYBOOK was produced for NBC TELEVISION during the 1958 season. There were 41 one hour episodes produced. Shirley acted as hostess and narrator.. Her three children appeared as well. The series was rebroadcast on ABC as THE SHIRLEY TEMPLE SHOW in 1959. Unfortunately, DVD packagers tend to use photos of Shirley as a child as a selling point. This is very deceptive because these shows were made fully 20 years after her days as a child star for 20th Century Fox and really aren't all that memorable.",1513555200,,517,4.820224719101123
8112772,5,B000EQ5UIM,"I'm giving this collection a 5-star rating mainly as a way of balancing out the incredibly ignorant and churlish 1-star ratings, which this clever and imaginative early-TV show absolutely does not deserve. SHIRLEY TEMPLE'S STORYBOOK (later SHIRLEY TEMPLE THEATRE) was a delightful children's series that presented intelligent and well-made classic stories -- and in color, long before color TV caught on -- in much the way Shelley Duvall later did in FAERIE TALE THEATRE in the 1980s (in fact, Shelley was inspired by the earlier series). My only regret about this collection is that some of my personal best-remembered episodes aren't here (""Beauty and the Beast"", ""Rip Van Winkle"", ""King Midas"", ""Rumpelstiltskin"", to name a few). Still, what there is is well worth the price.",1408924800,5,778,5.232
8112773,5,B000EQ5UIM,"I'm sorry the other reviewers didn't know what Shirley Temple's Storybook is. Episodes of this series are in some of my earliest childhood memories.

I can understand the confusion a little. Even though the title clearly says 1958 when all her movies are from the 30's and 40's, it doesn't list the episodes. I know it's only the second season, and not every episode. Which means Mother Goose isn't in it.

I'll try to find out which episodes are in here before I buy it. I know this is the only release of that series so it's pretty unlikely I'll ever see Mother Goose or Hiawatha again. But I'll give it five stars because it's all that survives of the series and it's Shirley. I grew up with a grownup Shirley Temple in the news every now and then, being a diplomat and such. I watched the movies but I was thinking ""that cute little kid is all grown up."" Annette was more my age.",1392076800,10,883,4.345454545454546
8112774,1,B000EQ5UIM,These dvds were not at all what I had thought I bought. They really are kids stories being played out by amitures. Not very well done or recorded either.,1312156800,4,153,4.310344827586207
8112775,1,B000EQ5UIM,You see a picture of cute little Shirley Temple on the cover?  Inside is a grown up Shirley Temple introducing segments of a poorly done kids show.  Don't waste your money on this one.,1310342400,3,184,4.382352941176471
8112776,3,B000EQ5UIM,"These are movies narrated by the ADULT Shirley with her 3 kids. All are very primitive movies. My 2yr. old grandchild did like one of the movies, the ""whinnie the pooh"" one. It is done like a theatrical play, as all of them are. I feel they should not have put the photo of the young Shirley on the cover. It is missleading. It should say; Shirley Temple Black!",1281225600,4,361,4.246376811594203
8112777,2,B000EQ5UIM,"The book written by George MacDonald is fine children's literature.  The movie which is very much like a photographed play is poorly done.  If a child saw it today, he or she would not realize how good the book is.  I hope some studio makes an excellent movie someday about The Princess and the Goblins and The Princess and Curdy so that these stories will not be forgotten by children.
  The Madeline stories are all done in rhyme and well illustrated.  However, this video is terrible.  The acting is poor and the sets are cheap looking.

8112778,3,B000EQ5UIM,"Yet another delightful disc packed with two choice episodes from Shirley Temple's anthology series, SHIRLEY TEMPLE'S STORYBOOK (aka ""The Shirley Temple Show""). Acting as a precursor to later series like ""Faerie Tale Theatre"" and Jim Henson's ""The Storyteller"", SHIRLEY TEMPLE'S STORYBOOK was a big ratings winner for NBC. Temple hosted and also indulged in an occasional starring role, surrounded by an amazing cast of noted Broadway and Hollywood talents.

Both of the episodes from this disc are taken from the 1960-61 season.

MADELINE (Season 2 Episode #5): Gina Gillespie brings to life the plucky heroine of Ludwig Bemelman's series of children's books. In an old house in Paris that's covered in vines, lived twelve little girls in two straight lines. The youngest one was Madeline... Co-starring Imogene Coca as Miss Clavel, we follow Madeline and next-door neighbour Pepito (Michel Petit) as they go in search of missing dog Genevieve, but become side-tracked by the delights of a colourful gypsy circus. Keep your eyes peeled for Ann Jillian as the oldest of the Clavel girls.

THE PRINCESS AND THE GOBLINS (Season 2 Episode #24): Shirley Temple stars as Princess Irene in this adaptation of George MacDonald's fantasy novel, about a mysterious, hidden race of goblins and the adventurous princess who, with the assistance of brave miner Curdie (Jack Ging) discovers their plot. Co-starring Alice Pearce, Mary Wickes and Irene Hervey.",1248134400,2,1444,5.296943231441048
8112779,4,B000EQ5UIM,"The movie is set in ""theatrical play"" style. It has a set stage and is a bit dated, but my children and I enjoyed it a lot. It has good actors and a nice flow.",1234224000,,159,3.5714285714285716
