7756243,5,B01G6AS40K,"No one actor has the edge in this fabulous saga of the beginning of the computer revolution. Each one brings absolutely everything to the table in truly unique characters. I'm not even that computer savvy but was riveted from the beginning. Just excellent in every way-writing, plot development, directing, acting. Highly recommend for just about anyone.",1471996800,,354,5.339285714285714
7756244,5,B01G6AS40K,"Lee Pace is the great star of this show. You should advertise it as a Lee Pace show. His brilliant acting for the complicated character of Joe MacMillan has brought millions of fans world wide to what would have remained otherwise a show with  limited audience. The writing is brilliantly fast paced. the music track is to die for, all four actors are excellent. But this is really a Lee Pace show. You should watch it for all the above but also because of Lee Pace and his  fantabulous interpretation of  the explosive and complicated character of Joe MacMillan",1471651200,2,562,4.656565656565657

8762419,5,B01G6AS40K,"As much as I love Season One, upon rewatching it, early episodes do have moments that verge on the slightly melodramatic; the latter part of the season corrected for this, resulting in an even more satisfying drama. Season Two continues in this quieter, subtler, dramatically realistic vein and the show is far better for it.

While Christopher Cantwell and Christopher C. Rogers were talented enough to create Halt and Catch Fire, their episodes in the first season were the least interesting, and the series really thrived at the hands of other writers (The Sopranos Jason Cahill, Zack Whedon, Jamie Pachino, and Mad Men alumnus Dahvi Waller) led by show runner Jonathan Lisco. In the second season, Cantwell and Rogers step up their game, writing episodes that are among the best of the season; the season finale Heaven Is A Place is particularly great, and is not only the best of Season Two, but the programs best season finale to date (having not yet aired its fourth season and series finale).

At the end of each season, its bold tradition for the show to shake up the setting and character relationships in preparation for the season ahead. So, Season Two further pursues the changes that occurred in the Season One finale 1984, picking up over a year after. Rather than the computer business alone, the show now focuses on the burgeoning subscription-driven internet via Camerons company Mutiny. While the season starts off very well, things don't really click until Episode Five, and, in typical Halt and Catch Fire fashion, the drama is written with an eye to being absorbed as a season-long arc, so story elements that might seem trivial may have their impact come to full fruition only later on in the season, always with very satisfying results.

While Halt and Catch Fire had major, if not equally important, roles for its female characters Cameron Howe and Donna Clark in Season One, they take the lead in actively driving the drama this season. Cams as impulsive and temperamental as ever, while Donna feels obsessively obliged to bring stability and order to the company they head together. Its engaging stuff, making this one of the most feminist shows around, if not the most feminist. Most programs use female characters as sexual titillation or, at best, a supplement to generate drama for its central male ones. (Anything by J.J. Abrams and his team of writers, who are among the most sought in Hollywood this last decade, comes to mind.) Halt and Catch Fire never does.

However, this leaves Joe MacMillan and Gordon Clark taking a slight backseat dramatically, which makes for slightly less engaging storytelling. This isn't necessarily an issue arising from screen time or because the women are given higher profiles. Its that the more passive roles given these men occasionally result in exasperating storytelling, particularly Joes relationship to his fiance at the start of the season and Gordons obstacles in the penultimate episode. Yet, its also worth noting that the storylines for all, including the two main male leads and John Bosworth, are largely dramatically innovative  just more so for the female leads.

Indeed, this is the first season that has been critically acclaimed by most TV critics. In a TV landscape content to condescendingly write about regular people with little intelligence beyond street smarts, this series thankfully has a main cast of truly brilliant yet relatable characters; this can sometimes make it hard to keep up. Much like Mad Men, this show is better appreciated and comprehended upon repeated viewings.

The series remains as unpredictable as ever and adds fascinating new characters -- specifically Tom Rendon. However, the reliance on substance abuse through drugs and alcohol to create levity is a turn off; for such smart, original-thinking characters to lower themselves to partake in such stereotypical notions of what a good time entails is depressing; yet its a minor gripe in an otherwise beautifully written, subtle, often funny, realistic series that remains as moving and surprising as ever. Despite a setting revolving around computers and the internet, about which I know little beyond my own utilitarian relationship to it, what pulls me into the narrative is that Halt and Catch Fire is centered on the very relatable, human story of the search for love and the need for connection that remains its beautiful core.",1506211200,4,4401,5.062068965517241
