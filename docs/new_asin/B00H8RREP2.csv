6141676,5,B00H8RREP2,"Wonderful!  This is a longer energy session.  If you are ill and trying these to help you with your illness, I would recommend the am and pm QiGong because it is more gentle and less time.  Use this one when you are feeling a bit stronger and have more time.  I love it and use it during my mid day exercise, meditation, and me time.  I use the am and pm daily and when Im under the weather.  These are healing!",1430265600,18,411,4.012345679012346
6141677,2,B00H8RREP2,"I found this to be extremely annoying!!!!  He repeats each exercise 10 times and my neck and shoulders were extremely sore, I couldn't complete the 45 mins.  Too much bouncing and flopping around.  The only ecstasy I felt was exquisite pain.  Don't bother!",1428105600,,256,4.883720930232558

6141681,5,B00H8RREP2,"Excellent companion piece to his book, The Master Key. I was hoping that would be the case, and it turned out to be exactly right. The book is a great introduction to Mr. Peng and his techniques. But to see him in action actually doing the exercises is priceless.

As a bonus, there's a fine interview with him conducted by Tami Simon, the publisher of Sounds True. It's engaging, informative, and uplifting. If you're thinking about getting involved with Qigong and looking for a way to start, this could easily be it.",1408924800,15,519,4.641304347826087
6141682,4,B00H8RREP2,Very good for beginners in qigong.,1407888000,5,34,4.833333333333333
6141683,5,B00H8RREP2,"Although I have been doing Tai Chi for over twenty years, there were parts of me which I could not seem to relax.  Learning to nurture my chi, as taught by Robert, even thought it's the easiest thing I have ever done, has brought me to a profound sense of peace and relaxation.  Robert teaches us how to heal ourselves, so that we can stop the eternal search for solutions outside of ourselves.  I am extremely grateful for Roberts teaching and example.",1401321600,25,453,4.5
6141684,5,B00H8RREP2,Love it!  This is the best DVD from Mr. Peng to date. Totally recommend it as it delibers on the whole ecstacy aspect.,1395100800,14,118,4.130434782608695
6141685,5,B00H8RREP2,"Received this 2 days ago and my husband and I have done all the exercises twice and feel great! I confess I am something of a ""couch potato"" (and nearly 60 years old) and I am thrilled to get my body moving and love every minute of it when I do the movements on this DVD. The joy of movement is blissful, and Robert's voice as he guides the movements is very grounded and warm. Also love the interview with Robert by Tami Simon that is included on this DVD. I have already ordered another copy to give to my sisters. I also highly recommend Robert's book, The Master Key, which includes his remarkable life story, as well as a powerful meditation ""Awakening Awareness."" I feel much clearer and more energized after doing the DVD exercises - this is the best qigong DVD I have ever seen. Robert's website also has a fascinating one minute video of Robert doing qigong on the Prime Minister of Australia which is worth checking out (this is video number 4 on the home page). I hope you get this DVD and enjoy it as much as my husband and I. Robert is both humble and powerful- the real deal.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Master-Key-Qigong-Secrets-for-Vitality-Love-and-Wisdom/dp/1622031393/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Master Key: Qigong Secrets for Vitality, Love, and Wisdom</a>",1391212800,51,1330,5.1336405529953915

6141688,5,B00H8RREP2,"Master Peng's DVD is the real thing. It's low key and gentle, not overly demanding, but when it's over you know you've gotten a good physical workout. It also generates a state of deep relaxation and spiritual well being, both necessary elements for authentic Qi Gong.  If you use your mind to visualize the chi while you are moving through the exercises (rather than performing them mechanically while your mind wanders) the benefits will be even greater.",1489363200,6,456,4.922077922077922

6141693,4,B00H8RREP2,"Second time's the charm. Just did this again after leaving it to gather dust for about a year.  For some reason it didn't appeal to me first time out. I think I may have done it in the morning - I enjoyed it much more as an evening session.

It takes place outdoors in a pretty mountainside garden. Robert Peng has a sincere, gentle presence and a soft warm voice. He wears a neat black T-shirt and trousers which I found restful compared to the distractingly voluminous silk pyjamas so many Qigong and Tai Chi masters seem to favour. The music is ambient and light and not at all cheesy faux-Chinese. Peng's cueing is rhythmic, clear and helpful.

The disc has quite a new-age flavour. There's talk of the universe and such, and Robert Peng says things like 'Open all the pores of your skin; inhale through the pores...' 'When you inhale, taste the sweetness of your heart...' and 'You are in the midst of bliss...'. I'm okay with this kind of talk and in fact I found it quite conducive to the visualisations that accompany the exercises, but I know it's not everyone's cup of tea.

So what's on the disc? Well we start off standing for a bit, with posture-alignment tips, etc., and then go on to:
Shaking. Shake your body to some rhythmic music. I think this may be what put me off the first time. I'm not a big fan of shaking (even though I know it's good for me) and it felt like it went on forever the first time I did it. On the second go-around, I'd say there's just about 5 or 6 minutes of it.
Next: Pushing and Stretching.  With one hand on your heart, you push other hand out to the side at shoulder height, palm out, while turning your head to the opposite side, then bring the outstretched arm to the front, head to centre, and lower hands. This is repeated from side to side about ten times or so. It opens the chest, back and neck muscles and I did find it very relaxing. Next set of stretches involves pushing both hands out to the sides with head back, then bringing both arms to the front with head down, also repeated a number of times.
Next: Scooping Qi is a nice sequence of spiralling arm movements while visualising qi being scooped towards your dan tien and upwards through other points until it reaches the third eye.  Then you stand still with your arms raised outwards to form a funnel and visualise a vortex of light over your head.  The sequence is repeated and then, at the end of the final 'vortex' you imagine a large golden ball of qi between your hands, and proceed to the next section with it:
Gliding Across the Universe: Facing front,  bend smoothly to squat then stretch upwards, raising and lowering the qi ball at the front of your body. After a number of reps you you turn to the side in bow stance and shift weight from leg to leg as you raise and lower the ball in a graceful arc. This is repeated on the other side. We go on to do some free-form 'play' with the ball and, to finish 'press the pearl of joy into your lower abdomen' to absorb the qi into your dan tien.
Finally you lie down to relax, visualising yourself filled with qi and floating in an ocean of qi, while Robert intones a Chinese blessing. The music is lovely here, mixed with the sound of waves and little bell-sounds.
A relaxing, refreshing qigong session, best suited, in my opinion to an evening session.",1470960000,5,3320,4.36084142394822

6141698,3,B00H8RREP2,Interesting but somewhat repetitive of other DVD's of his.  Glad I bought this one.,1462752000,,83,4.928571428571429

6141702,4,B00H8RREP2,"This DVD and the other one Robert Peng has called the Master Key Series is a very nice collection of traditional Qi Gong exercises.  This is different from his Master Key series in two respects.  One, the exercises are different from that series and to me, seem much gentler with the ability to concentrate the movements or expand the movements for less energy intensity.  In the Master Key series, there are some very strong visuals that intensify the Qi energy.  I have been working with Qi energy for many years and I do not do as many reps as Robert does in this series (he does roughly about 9-12 reps of each movement).  I do not have the need to do as many.  The second thing about this DVD different from his Master Key DVD is that this one does NOT have any graphic visual aids like the Master Key series.

I wish it did.  Because using the graphic visual aids is really nice in the Master Key series (although he could have kept the visuals in throughout the exercise).  This video had none of those so if you are a beginner or if you simply like to see the visual aids, you will not see them in this production.  You basically see Robert going through his moves and speaking as he helps you along.  This is a ""just push play"" go-along video so what you see is just what you get.  No graphic aids, just Robert going through is moves.  I suppose what makes these DVD's so nice however is the tranquil mood and tone that is set by Robert, making time stand still for you, taking you away from the stress of the day to become involved in something that is uniquely helpful for you.

If you have not seen Robert's use of energy and the healing sessions he has on some of his clients, you can see them on youtube.

I will say however, I have worked with Qi Gong before many years ago and I did not get as much at all out of those expensive sessions as I got from these simple DVD's.  Whether it is because I have advanced along the way and built up my Qi or if it is because of the condensed energy in these exercises, or perhaps my long-life experience in energy systems, or maybe all above, I don't know.  But this video is very nice and the go-along idea (like so many exercise videos these days) is a good one and Robert takes you through the moves in a very beautiful relaxing setting that will certainly take you to another level of awareness.",1449705600,16,2354,4.2657657657657655

6141704,5,B00H8RREP2,"Many of the exercises go through a lot of repetitions (and can make this DVD boring) but they are fantastic exercises and I feel great after I do them.  I do many of them on my own now with fewer reps when I just have a couple minutes.  I don't think this is a DVD to do over and over, but one that could help you develop your own routine.",1436572800,10,339,3.8285714285714287
