However, the performance, stage design and lighting are not as good as in another movie from Jean-Pierre Ponnelle, Verdi's ""Rigoletto"". I'd rather turn the TV off or watch the weather network while playing the sound tracks on this DVD, just because of the artificial acting, fake smiling and the make-up of Freni. I am expecting another Madama Butterfly on DVD from Columbia TriStar with Ying Huang singing Cio-cio-san, although her voice was not as amazing as Freni's.",1007683200,,538,4.988888888888889

1641879,5,B00005OC06,"Mirellia Freni and Placido Domingo were definitely at the top of their singing game for this filmed version of the opera. The singing was excellent. Their voices were very emotive and shimmered - never strident  and no straining for high notes. The Vienna Philharmonic under Herbert von Karajan played beautifully - very much an ensemble and with no weird tempi. Many have given this filmed version of the opera a poor rating because they felt something about the sets, staging and/or acting wasn't authentic or good enough. Don't let this stop you from buying this DVD. The sets, staging and acting were just fine. I however, don't give too much importance to these as long as they are not done poorly. It is my opinion that opera was created mainly as a form of music and thus depicts/expresses the human experience on an emotional level through sound. Thus, it would never be able to depict the human experience authentically on just a visual level no matter how great the sets, staging and acting are. That is why the performers have to sing and play well. If you want to see human experiences depicted fairly realistically on a visual level, watch a film or attend a theatre performance - and even those two don't always do it well.",1374710400,6,1237,4.700460829493087

1641881,5,B00005OC06,"I cannot not help but agree with so many of the comments being made in these reviews and yet it still cannot shake my opinion that this version of Butterfly is both musically and dramatically brilliant. What one person criticizes, the other praises and the odd thing is that I can see it both ways.  It certainly does offer a number of anachronisms as well as a certain amount of kitsch. Nevertheless, I have had the DVD for years and I simply cannot get over how powerfully directed and musically compelling it is.  I recommend it to people all of the time.  For me the flower duet, which is done in a manner that could never be achieved onstage, is simply an astonishingly beautiful and magical idea.  Additionally, the death of Butterfly, delayed until Pinkerton arrives, is unique and powerful because it gives Butterfly's character an added level of strength which is often missing.  After all she tells Kate that she will give Pinkerton his son ""if he will come to fetch him.  Climb the hill in half and hour from now"".  Ponnelle's staging of the final scene, which does not follow the action described in parenthesis' certainly reflects this text which is usually lost in virtually every production I have seen, accepting those who have seen this version and learned from it!",1371254400,,1282,4.721973094170403

1641884,4,B00005OC06,"I think this was meant to be a bit of a whim and an unusual production in the spirit of the summer festival celebrating Puccini in the place where he created his music. It takes the ""Butterfly"" theme literally and makes all the characters into insects except for Pinkerton who seems to be sort of a Marlon Brando biker. The sets are meant to be minimalist in the style of summer theater. Don't buy this if you don't own another more traditional version of MB because you will miss the classic presentation and realistic aspects of the story necessary for understanding and the way Puccini intended. Much is done with symbolism throughout and the final scene is very dramatic. There is a dream-weaver character that dances in pantomime and is part of the fanciful spirit of the production. The relationship between Pinkerton and Butterfly and their singing is tremendous. I think they are married. It also seems to be a tribute to Placido Domingo and shows him doing some rather dramatic directing. But the music is all beautiful Puccini as he wrote it.",1356307200,3,1052,4.754098360655738
1641885,4,B00005OC06,"Prequel: Dear reader,
Please note that this review has been posted by Amazon in two places - the correct place featuring the singers as in the review and the wrong place under a performance including Domingo. Please show a little understanding of this problem that is beyond reviewers' control. At the very least, by having by mistake, two reviews of two very different versions to read, it might prove to be worth reading both anyway. Best wishes, Ian Giles

...........................................
The version starring Elmira Vida now continues!

Madama Butterfly was Puccini's own favourite opera and is a firm favourite with audiences worldwide. This popularity has created strong views and there are as many opinions held about this opera as there are enthusiasts! The following description therefore is simply intended to be more of a guide to aid personal choice rather than a review leading to a firm conclusion.

In this performance, there is a particularly fine balance maintained between the two contrasting characters of Pinkerton and Butterfly which enables them to establish a believable relationship in Act 1. Later in the opera, in Act 3, the impact of Pinkerton's actions seem to finally strike home which enhances the dramatic impact of the opera's conclusion.

In this performance Butterfly (Elmira Vida) portrays her unswerving devotion to both Pinkerton (Carlo Barricelli) and her child totally convincingly. In this she is helped by the show-stealing part played by the little boy who is both wonderful in his role and about the right age - I guess 3 years as it should be. Butterfly is not 15-18 years old as in the story of course, but in this performance she is still able to make it credible that Pinkerton would be smitten by her charms. The roles of Butterfly and Pinkerton are both convincingly acted as well as well sung.

The supporting roles of Suzuki (Annamaria Popescu) and Sharpless (Luca Salsi) are also equally well portrayed and believable with good communication and acting constantly maintained. The remaining solo parts and chorus are all completely satisfactory.

The outdoor set is simple but totally effective. This is a revolving stage showing interior and exterior sides of a Japanese style house with use made of the sliding and translucent panels. These panels enable telling use to be made of shadowy figures such as the arriving and fleeing relatives. Most tellingly it enables an unbending and uncommunicative Kate (Sally Wilson) to be shown in silhouette in contrast to the compliant Suzuki. This totally unyielding posture is maintained to the very end of her part and it makes one fear for the future life of the child in her care.

All the parts are well sung and acted with sustained communication with the intended exception of Kate as above. The outdoor nature of the event is overcome by the use of radio mikes which enable every word to be heard clearly. The translation of the subtitles in English is good and there are detailed booklet descriptions. The camera work is revealing without being invasive and the colours are rendered richly. The sound is presented in DTS-HD, Dolby Digital and stereo and is of good quality.

In summary therefore, the elements of communication and allied acting in this performance and production combine to achieve a dramatically strong and believable presentation. It is unlikely that it will be considered definitive by many but nevertheless, in my opinion, it would be unreasonable to rate it as worth less than 4 stars. It should be able to give many purchasers plenty of satisfaction while still leaving plenty of scope for alternative versions to be appreciated.",1341878400,7,3666,5.078073089700997
1641886,4,B00005OC06,This is one of the better Madam Butterflys' that I own.  I liked the young Domingo's voice and acting capabilities. I have 10 copies of the complete opera and 2 copies of different videos and this ranks right up there with the best. The rest is subject to listener/viewers taste.,1310256000,,279,4.58
1641887,2,B00005OC06,"An opera libretto contains detailed stage instructions including settings and scenery. These are an integral part of the composition and complement the singing in conveying emotion. For example, Act I of Puccini's Madam Butterfly (Ricordi, 1906) describes the opening scene as ""a Japanese house, terrace and garden. Below, in the background, the bay, the harbour and the town of Nagasaki."" Whenever an impudent director decides to ""revise"" an opera by changing the setting as radically as was done here, there should be a clear disclaimer that this is NOT the original opera. In this production, the wretched scenery and costumes interfere with the music and singing in conveying the emotion. It is a pity because there is some great singing, especially from Dess. But the only way to enjoy it is to close your eyes and just listen to the music and the singing. In which case, you may as well buy the CD instead of the DVD! Two stars is average of four for the singing and zero for the direction. ""Mondo reo. Non c' pi virt. Tutto declina"".",1282348800,7,1040,4.783333333333333
1641888,1,B00005OC06,"While the voices are fine, the production values are very disappointing.  The video is poor and the audio is poor.  The overall direction approach doesn't work.  I'd much rather see a video of a stage production.  After  several emails to the seller, Moviemars, I received no satisfaction on return or substitution.",1268524800,2,315,5.098039215686274
1641889,4,B00005OC06,"Not having read the brief message on the back of the cover, it came as a surprise that this was a film not a photographed live performance. The opening scene, as some reviewers have pointed out, was hardly an inducement to stay the course. (It showed a disheveled Pinkerton in T-Shirt running out of what we learn is his Japanese house, obviously in the grip of strong emotions for whose cause all who know the story of Madame Butterfly immediately register.) Customarily, I do not like filmed versions much preferring photographed live performances.
To be fair, I did not mind the unmoving mouths indicating introspective rather than objectified expression. What I did mind was the failure to take advantage of the possibilities inherent in film making but denied to the stage. This lack of adventurousness made for a lack of vigor and creativity in the production.
Yet, regardless of being an example of routine film-making, I had quite a good time. The reason is simple enough: the ravishing music by Puccini, which never goes stale, and the top-notch singing by the two stars, Domingo as Pinkerton, Freni as Butterfly. Having the likes of Christa Ludwig in support strengthened the positive response. Frankly, while I would have preferred seeing them sing live, with all its risks, but yet with its spark of spontaneity, I still could not resist that music, so endowed with the spirit of love dominant and love betrayed. If you have seen numerous versions of the opera, probably you should pass on this one and take another look at a production with which you are familiar. If you have never seen the opera in full, or have seen it only a few times, it is quite likely this will provide you with a most satisfying experience. Later you can take on one of the more full-blooded live performances.",1252800000,2,1799,4.806451612903226
1641890,5,B00005OC06,"This version of Madama Butterfly is simply astonishing. Freni and Domingo are magnificent and Von Karajan, once again, proves to be the great maestro of all times. I watched this dvd with some friends and all of us were moved,some to tears, at the power of the performances.",1237248000,2,274,4.729166666666667
1641891,5,B00005OC06,"I am very familiar with the music of this opera but had never seen it performed until receiving this DVD.  Instead of being performed on a stage, it is done as a movie which makes it even more realistic.  It is truly beautiful.  It was 'filmed' in 1974 and Freni & Domingo are young & their voices AND acting are wonderful.",1231459200,,323,4.262295081967213
1641892,4,B00005OC06,"This isn't a full review but a response to the other reviews here - I read all of them. The singing is excellent and listening to it with the video turned off is not a bad idea as some have suggested. The visuals are not uniformly bad. There are bad moments - I agree with those others have noted. Few have noted the good moments - there are some! One example is the morning scene after Butterfly has waited all night for Pinkerton to return. It is a lovely movie moment. There are lots of moments that are perfectly fine - like the flower scene in the garden - not great movie-making, but perfectly fine. Most of the scenes in the movie fall into the ""more or less good"" category. Of course it is the embarrassingly bad (or just puzzling) ones that stick in the mind of most reviewers here. If you watch this movie, bring a big helping of forgiveness for the visuals and you'll enjoy it. If something offends you, close your eyes and enjoy the singing!",1228262400,4,953,4.329608938547486
1641893,3,B00005OC06,"From the David Belasco play to Puccini's opera to Schonberg's Miss Saigon, there are many faces of Madame Butterfly. But none is any more exquisite than that of Mirella Freni-- especially as she sings the near-perfect aria, ""Un bel di"" and the Flower Song duet with Suzuki. However, Ponnelle, who staged and directed the film version, made Placido Domingo as Lt. Pinkerton  a little too caddish for my taste. This version seems to resemble a faded memory that speaks not to the intellect but to the heart. It certainly deserves a place in any opera collection.",1210464000,2,560,4.833333333333333

1641895,3,B00005OC06,"If you're looking for a screen adaptation of Madama Butterfly, your best bet would be to choose Madame Butterfly made in 1995 starring Richard Troxell. This dvd version is barely above a filmed stage version, and perhaps a filmed stage version would have been better than the absolutely atrocious staging. If you are looking for a fantastic version of Madama Butterfly to listen to, then get the recording with Freni and Domingo. The acting in this dvd is definitely a reason to get it, if only for Mirella Freni and Christa Ludwig, who make this movie in the part of acting. Domingo has a great voice but the acting is so-so. If you can get past the complete lack of budget for this movie (Butterfly's 'kimono' doesn't even have the sleeves finished, if you notice, they're fraying because they were just cut) and past the fact that Pinkerton is in a t-shirt, then this is a decent dvd. Get this for the vocals alone, but get the newer version of a visual and aural experience that will be the only version of Madame Butterfly you'll ever need.",1197417600,4,1045,4.593582887700535
1641896,3,B00005OC06,"We were disappointed with this first viewing of Madama Butterfly. We found it melodramatic rather than tragic which may be attributed to the production. The flashbacks, dream sequences and ""inner thought vocals"" were annoying, the lighting was poor and too contrived in many of the scenes, the staging was good but not great and fading between scenes was disastrous. The vocals were very good... but I love Freni.",1196035200,2,413,5.088235294117647
1641897,5,B00005OC06,"Reading some of the other reviews here, I wonder if I'm in the same universe. I feared this dvd for a long time, having been bleached of hope by years of indifferent if not hostile reviews and commentary about it. I think Puccini planned that NO performance of Butterfly would ever truly be sufficient, truly right. But surely, Ponnelle's valiant film effort comes close. For me, closer than any other available dvd version. Two reasons front and center - the singing of Mirella Freni and Karajan's handling of the score with the Vienna Philharmonic. Having just this past week watched the Butterflys of Cedolins and Barker, Freni's magnificent singing is proof that the mitred age of Italian opera is passed. Any musician knows there's no comparison between Freni's singing and that of Cedolins and Barker, both of whom offer respectable enough versions of the score. Freni sings grand opera from the inside out, and THAT grace is found missing in every other available dvd of this opera. If the exposition of the human voice, yes even in verismo art, is your reason for opera, this film will love you, and you it. Mirella Freni's musicianly command of Puccini's eternally fecund score is overwhelming from beginning to end. The singing is epic, intelligent and purged of self regard. No less fertile is Karajan's intense way with Puccini, fevered but ever cool, ever rigorous. The Vienna orchestra finesses textures like a cat, every nuance cared for with golden perfection - it's a beautiful thing! Christa Ludwig embraces the role of Suzuki with incomparable singing and a riveting attentiveness as Cio-Cio-San's confidant. Her singing of the incantations that open Act 2 is easily equal to Cossotto's turn with Price. Forget the complaints about lonely heaths and cramped houses. Ponnelle creates a bewitching exterior with coastal grasses; the interior sets are never onerous or pretentious, reaching in fact a tremendous peacefulness by film's end. Ponnelle's genius with colors and texture, and certainly his motive behind the camera is remarkable, emotional, noble. What more can you ask for? The discolation from lip-synching is noticable but minimal, and even used to engaging advantage by Cio-Cio-San who occasionally assumes interior reflection by eschewing singing altogether, something impossible on a live stage. It's not perfect but damned near, a worthwhile filmed vision of an inexhaustible opera.",1194912000,10,2416,5.229381443298969
1641898,2,B00005OC06,"I have a large collection of opera dvds.  Many people only prefer to purchase staged versions, but I don't mind movie versions as well.  They give you an entirely new prospective to the story...if its done well.  This production of Butterfly is one of the worst productions of ANYTHING that I have ever seen.  Once you see the opening scene, when Domingo begins running through a random field, you should brace yourself, because it only goes downhill from there. The singing is quite good, but the cinematography and the staging is absolutely attrocious.  The camera angles are just bad and the sequence from Act 2 to Act 3 (which is all done as one act in this production) looks very, very, STUPID.  The best part of this production is Butterfly's death, which leaves Pinkerton in a state of...well, you just have to see it.  That is the only promising piece of staging in the whole production.  If you want to save some money, I would not suggest buying this production unless you want to get a couple of opera friends together, and have a nice laugh...",1151280000,9,1055,4.634408602150538
1641899,4,B00005OC06,"I can't understand all this carping about how rotten Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's film is. Okay, this isn't Orson Welles. The film is certainly flawed, with a few cheesy moments, most of which have been mentioned in other reviews(the opening, with Domingo in a T-shirt comically running through a paper wall, the bizarre dream sequence, Goro as a bucktoothed stereotype). These flaws are what prevent me from giving the film a five star rating. But there are also some very beautiful moments, and besides, from an aural standpoint, you aren't going to find a better performance of Madama Butterfly ANYWHERE. Get a grip, folks. To hear Freni and Domingo at their prime singing what is arguably Puccini's greatest score(it is certainly his most beautiful) conducted by Herbert von Karajan, and for under twenty dollars, I would be willing to put up with the singers running around in clown makeup for two-and-a-half hours. The music making on this disc is simply too good not to be recommended just because the filmmaker's ambitions occasionally tax his reach.

For me, a good opera film captures the mood of the music. Butterfly is probably Puccini's most atmospheric, lush, and dreamy score(although La Fanciulla del West is stiff competition), and Ponnelle's film is appropriately dreamlike. Let's use the marvelous love duet that ends the first act as an example. For me, this duet, along with Liu's death scene from Turandot, represents Puccini at the very height of his musical-dramatic brilliance. The music is rapturous and erotic, delaying the crescendo until the moment becomes almost unbearable. Ponnelle paints this music in dreamlike images of ever-increasing passion. Granted, this film was made in 1974, so some of the more trippy moments might seem a little dated, but if you take that into account, the moment is beautifully filmed, haunting and evocative, just like the score. The image perfectly matches the music...isn't that what opera on film is all about? If this were the only example of this perfect union of sound and vision, then I would be less enthusiastic about the film as a whole, but throughout most of Madama Butterfly, Ponnelle manages that lush, languorous tide of images that matches Puccini's flowing music.

Regarding the sound portion, as I said before, you won't hear Butterfly performed better, that is a guarantee. Mirella Freni IS Cio-Cio-San, the innocence, the passion, the self-delusion, the heartbreak. Oh, and she sings the role to perfection, capturing the character's timidity and strength. Butterfly's entrance is probably my favorite musical entrance in all opera, and hearing Freni's singing, quiet at first and from a distance, gradually building as she and her bridal party make their arrival, is a breathtaking moment, outclassing any staged production I have ever seen. A very young Placido Domingo is in prime voice, and is ideally cast as the rake B.F. Pinkerton, initially  cavalier to the point of being cruel, later violently regretful(too little, too late). He does look somewhat risible running in slow motion with his arms flailing about in his handlebar mustache, but overall he is a fine romantic lead. Robert Kerns has a strong and compassionate baritone voice, which matches his character's best qualities, the voice of reason, Pinkerton's disregarded conscience. Having Christa Ludwig in the role of Suzuki might be considered luxury casting, since her character is less prominent, but she makes the most of her time onstage as the matronly confidante to Butterfly, she is definitely at her prime vocally at this point in her career. Von Karajan's conducting is also in its prime, not as slow as it sometimes is, or else I didn't notice it because the slowness matches the languid tempo of much of the music. The sound quality is clear and full-bodied enough that hardly any of the notes are obscured.

Forget the negative reviews. If you love Butterfly, give this a chance. There are flaws, but considering the strengths of the performances and of much of the film, those flaws are easily overlooked.",1148947200,16,4064,5.125188536953243

1641901,5,B00005OC06,"I completely disagree with some of the reviewers.  How easy it is to misunderstand a fine director's intentions!
The story of ""Butterfly"" is one of the most sordid tragedy in all opera repertoire. Think about it.  An innocent 15 year old girl to escape poverty, thru a profit-hungry marriage broker, marries an opportunistic and unscrupulous American sea captain who seduces and abandons her..  She is cursed and abandoned by society, robbed of her child and driven to suicide.
So what do the reviewers want?  Pretty Japanese scenery with Fujijama in the background?
The director created a unique film  that's atmospheric, surrealistic, colorless to suit this story.  The set: a nondescript cottage surrounded by a depressing barren field.  Characters are well drawn, even the secondary ones. (eg. the grotesque but frightening Goro  or  the terrifying Bonzo).
It is unfortunate that the 15 year old Cio-Cio San is played by a much older singer which is illusion destroying, but Mirella Freni is superb, it is HER role.
Musically this set is absolutely without equal,(perhaps the magical Sinopoli comes near,but that's a CD) but I must emphasize the contribution of Karajan, who is the genius behind it all.  I never thought he was a Puccini fan, but obviously he has a special feeling for this work.  He takes a dramatic view of the score and almost re-discovers the opera. His ear for detail is uncanny, the love-duet is sensuous with soaring melodic lines, the great aria (Un bel di) rarely sounded more dramatic, full of emotion. It just builds and builds!  And the 3rd act is so powerful, it will leave you breathless. You won't forget this film easily.",1146787200,29,1658,4.967391304347826

I bought this turkey before I read the reviews, then stupidly after I'd read them, I had a chance to return it for a refund but chose to watch it instead.  The music was glorious (except for the grunt during the ""memorable dream sequence"" (according to the box) that Puccini hardly wrote).  That said (I suggest as do others in their reviews that if you want this production, buy a CD, NOT this ghastly DVD), on to the rest of it.  The thing made both Domingo and Puccini look ridiculous.  Freni's ""thoughts"" were stupid (nobody else did it), the boy's hair was brown, not blond, Freni's teeth were perfectly fine, the little introduction (Domingo jumping through the wall and knocking people out of the way) was I suppose supposed to be modern or some crap like that.  Domingo did chew gum and wear a T-shirt.  Their lip-synching was good enough, subtitles were sparse so I got to look at their faces, but they didn't seem to be miming, though of course from the way it was filmed you knew they had to be (plus I'd been warned by those who know better).  It was supposed to have been filmed in color, but I watched half yesterday and half tonight, and woke up this morning thinking it was all in grey.  In fact that's all I can remember of it now.  I'm going to throw it away.  It's trash.  I feel I've been had (this sucker cost me $26 + shipping), I've searched everywhere but cannot find a good film of Butterfly.  Why?  The music is heavenly and the story is heartbreaking.  (I cried at the end of even this one.)  I want a conventional, traditional Butterfly performed the way Puccini and his librettists wrote it.  Is that too much to ask?  They do it with other operas.  One last word (except from now on I read reviews before I buy a DVD!!!).  The concept of this production conformed perfectly to the story.  Many unconventional touches brought home, brought out perfectly what the story was all about.  But it didn't work.  It was just lousy.  Oh.  And there sure was a lot of fog for spring.  Maybe someone else would like it, it was Butterfly after all (except for the grunt during the ""memorable dream sequence""), but I sure as hell didn't like it.  Now to the garbage with this.  Yeah.  I'm so damned rich I can afford to blow $30 on Freni, Domingo, Ludwig and Karajan and come up with a piece of nonsense like this!  Thanks a lot.

If that's your first and foremost wish, get the Frederic Mitterand 1995 film with the Chinese soprano (now THAT should get rave reviews, shouldn't it, because she's got the Oriental eyes; and the Tunisian location will easily fool you into thinking that this indeed is Nagasaki).

1641904,1,B00005OC06,"I agree with the above review by Mr. Santos but not for the same reasons or, at least, the same order of reasons. The fact that the TV director (here is where Brian Large makes all the difference) chose to focus on Placido Domingo more than it should be recommended is bad. But in time we get accustomed and even forget that Placido is there. What we cannot forget and never will, even after months after having seen this recording, are the tremendously ugly, horrific and tasteless costumes and scenery.

The concept behind this staging was that if a butterfly is an insect and the heroine is called Butterfly, then she should be dressed as such an insect, antennae and all. And all the other characters, why not, should be insects as well.  That is why Suzuki appears like what seems be a giant moth, Sharpless like a huge kind of beetle, the chorus that enter with Butterfly look like a caterpillar, Goro like a disgusting cockroach from the filthiest gutter, the son Dolore like a ten year old fat and slow lady bug, Yamadori, what can that be? a silkworm? and Kate, what is that? Is she a giant ant or a disproportioned wasp? I don't know, everything is so incompetently designed that it is diffidult to make the correct guesses.

Now, someone could be asking, and what about Pinkerton? Well, aye there's the rub, for he does not have antennae so he is not an insect. Could he be a rat? He is dressed in a black uniform as someone out from Marlon Brando's gang in the film ""The Wild One"", only he forgot to bring the motorcycle. He has very black sideburns, a goatee to go with it and he wears a thin ponytail. What can he be? Here I give up.

Oh, I forgot to tell that during the ""humming chorus"" there appears someone dressed like a black spider and after some slow and demented steps of ballet throws its net over Suzuki and Dolore, not to eat them but to protect them. Then the spider goes away and when the sailors begin to sing she returns and picks

its net back.

The sets, or better yet the one piece of set, resembles a part of the desert where Manon Lescaut dies in Puccini's opera. Meaning what? With what purpose?

Well, and what about the singing and playing? The singing is good but it gets hampered by the dreadful outfits, with Daniela Dessi having to fight with collars, veils and tails. Fabio Armiliato and Juan Pons, both also excellent singers, deserved a better fate than this. They should have refused to appear so ridiculously dressed.

Placido Domingo is there allright but I think he is feeling a little bit ashamed at having to be a part of such a terrible disaster.

I don't intend to watch it again and would only wish that Guillermo Mariotto (costumes) and Arnaldo Pomodoro (set) should give my money back",1118707200,33,2740,4.474949899799599
1641905,3,B00005OC06,"This supposedly new release from Deutsche Grammophon is actually the same 1974 production previously released under the Decca label in 2001. That older title is still available at Amazon. This is a film version, not a stage production. It was directed by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle and starred some of the finest performers available at the time. The great Herbert von Karajan conducts the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra and Vienna State Opera. It is without question a magnificient performance. Mirella Freni sings the role of Butterfly as few others can match. Placido Domingo is in equally fine form. Christa Ludwig is excellent as Suzuki. And yet the film as a whole doesn't really work. The trouble is that while Ponnelle tries to make this into a movie version of Butterfly, he neither has the resources nor the capability for doing so. The staging looks decidedly cheap, lacklustre and as some have commented, tacky. An effective movie version would benefit from realistic settings, a real house on a hill, with a sparkling Bay beneath. It could have done without some of the sensationalist/ridiculous set directions, like having Domingo jump out through the paper walls of the house, ostensibly for dramatic effect. This production could have worked (indeed would have been a triumphant success) if filmed purely as a stage based opera. However Ponnelle's final choice puts it neither here nor there. We have sets that look like they belong on stage (and not a very good stage at that), yet the performers are made to act as if they were in a movie. We get to see Placido Domingo chewing gum while he contemplates marrying Cio Cio San, presumably to show what a cad he is. And he continues to chew gum even while he's supposed to be singing. While this is still set in 19th century Japan, Domingo is seen to wear an obviously 20th century T-shirt. Domingo can act far better than what is shown here. As for the singing, the performances are all dubbed post-production. Lip synching ranges from poor to laughable. Because this is supposed to be a movie, and not a staged opera, we get the truly unbelieveable sight of these great performers singing without having to open their mouths - as we are supposed to be hearing their thoughts. Again, this could work provided the director is able to convince the audience that they are in a realistic film world. Unfortunately we are never transported into that world, we are all too aware that this is an opera sung on stage, albeit lip-synched.

The original Decca DVD sported a very soft, grainy transfer in fullscreen (pan & scan), littered with dirt specks and film nicks, looking very much like a poor quality VHS tape and this DG reissue looks no different. I can do without the DTS remix. This was recorded in stereo and the original release, in addition to a Dolby 5.0 surround, already had an excellent uncompressed Linear PCM audio track with quality equivalent to that of a good CD.

The original Decca release received mixed reviews. Aurally it is superb, one of the finest Butterflies ever. Visually it is close to a disaster. If you believe opera is only meant to be listened to, then this will be a top choice. If you believe opera should be an experience for both the eyes and ears, then pass this by. Even today, I still play the old Decca DVD, but only to listen to. I leave the TV off.

Note: It's not strictly correct to say that the singers were dubbed post-production. This movie has a curious history. It began as an audio-only studio recording with the exact same cast except that Luciano Pavarotti sang the role of Pinkerton. That recording was made in early 1974 at the Sofiensaal in Vienna. It received critical acclaim. The decision to make a movie using that original recording as a soundtrack came later that year. For the movie, they re-recorded Placido Domingo in the role as Pinkerton and spliced it into the earlier recording of the original cast. So the performers are in fact miming or lip-synching to the pre-recorded music while the film was being shot.",1118016000,94,4034,4.776504297994269

Alas, they did not, although they put the sound on DTS 5.0 which I am not yet able to listen to, which is the only difference compared to the DVD I already owned. (I think the sound might be great on DTS, but I do not know for now).

I think the singing on this DVD is superb and impeccable (I am a big fan of Domingo and Frenis pianissimos are the most beautiful you will ever hear).

The love is so intense that he interrupts even ""un bel d"" to show the static maestro FOUR times, and much more serious: in Butterfly's death scene, at the moment of commit suicide itself, he prefers to show the conductor!?!?

Outrageous and absurd...because the singing and mainly the drama is completely lost.

What a waste! Dess and Armiliato are great singers and I follow their presentations for a long time. Since this is a festival one can stand the director's madness, set designers and the absurd costumes: poor Butterfly, in her love duet have to arrange her unconfortable veil many times and keep up the voice and the acting!!!

Although, Jean-Pierre Ponnelle was a well liked director, especially during the 1970s when this was filmed, he almost ruins this DVD with outdated and misguided directing and editing.  The sets are generally tolerable but the costumes and make-up are unattractive and borderline silly.  Worst is the general directing and editing, which culminate at the end of the last act when a t-shirted Domingo jumps through a shoji screen to be freeze-framed in mid-air: a final example of Ponnelle's misguided attempts at drama.

Musically, the cast is superb.  Domingo is in strong voice and an ideal Pinkerton, despite being a bit clumsy an actor under Ponnelle's direction.  Freni fares much better as an actress, and is overall a lovely Butterfly, despite a few harsh notes.  Karajan leads the orchestra wonderfully, rounding out an overall strong and compelling interpretation of Puccini's score.

Ultimately, the poor production leads one to enjoy listening to the DVD more than watching it.  As such, until a better DVD of Butterfly is released, it may pay to just stick with audio recordings and forego the visuals which distract from the beauty of these fine musical artists' interpretations of one of opera's greatest scores.",1095724800,14,1290,5.253658536585366
1641909,5,B00005OC06,"Perhaps the most authoritative voice (in English at least) The Penguin Guide to Recordings of Classical Music judges Herbert von Karajan ""second to none"" as an interpreter of Puccini. However with an opera like Madama Butterfly that focuses on one character the lead singer must assume prime importance. Mirella Freni has recorded this opera three times and it is no coincidence that The Penguin Guide crowns her recordings as the three best. ""Sweeter of voice than any on record"" (their words), Freni effloresces as Butterfly, bringing into bloom her rich bouquet of tonal colors to flush the role to life with compelling urgency while ""consistently growing in stature from the young girl to the tragic heroine."" In uncharacteristic harmony, The Gramophone agrees that Freni is indeed the finest Butterfly while Fred Plotkin, former director of New York's Metropolitan Opera, in his book, ""Opera 101"", takes a step further and adorns her ""almost unrivaled"" in the sphere of Romantic Italian opera.

  Following its disastrous opening Puccini withdrew Madama Butterfly from performance and, along with the librettists, set to work on it for three months. The decision to mitigate the villainy of Pinkerton and invest him with some redeeming qualities proved pivotal for without such improvement the dynamic degenerates into  melodrama and Butterfly lapses into a silly young woman who closes her eyes to reality and gets crushed by it. Pinkerton--though careless (hence the chewing gum, t-shirt, tossing the Ottoke, the mutinous collar, etc.), irresponsible, and callously ethnocentric--is never consciously evil and the distinction becomes crucial to establishing Butterfly as a tragic heroine. Neither blind nor stupid, she retains a vision of humanity (based on the kind of person she is) that is nobler and finer than what we actually are and this is her hamartia (tragic flaw). Ponelle illuminates this for us by positioning his camera at ground level looking up so she emerges as a towering, heroic figure braced against the sky as she clenches her fists, throws her head back, and sings with passionate puissance, ""Tutto questo avverr, te lo prometto. Tienti la tua paura, io con sicura fede l'aspetto."" (All this will happen I promise you. Keep your fears to yourself, I shall await him with unshakeable faith.)

  The most enchanting voice ever to record the role of Butterfly, the most august baton of the second half of the twentieth century supported by two of its most beloved legends (Domingo and Ludwig), all captured working in concert to grace us with Puccini's opus magnum--for the true aficionado this is opera paradise. My fellow reviewers besmirch the page with whining over lip-synching, video quality, camera angles, the distension of Domingo's epigastrium, and (of all the inane twaddle) the alignment of Freni's incisors. Excuse me, but what does any of this have to do with music? Silence, ye film critics! This is the ethereal art of opera, not mere cinema.

1641910,3,B00005OC06,"We have a strong cast here (almost the strongest possible) : Karajan conducting the Vienna Philharmonic; and then there is Domingo, Freni & Ludwig etc. There is criticism on the other opera for having a Japanese Madama Butterfly. Yes, there is point there particularly when the latter is at that age and of that huge size. But on the other hand, Freni is the very opposite of any Japanese or indeed any oriental sense of a beauty, particulaly so on that make-up, and than there are so many close-up of her face which dispelled any mysterious sense of beauty of the East ...
The setting is comparatively dull: a huge Japanese house by the side of a desolate slope. The house is too large by general Japanese standard and the slope can't possibly remind us of their religious love for beautiful gardens, nor their Shintoism...
For the singing, well, Domingo will not disappoint you. Neither will there be much surprise for you. I have some reservation for the part of Freni, the phrasings are often on the verge of breaking. What really is disappointing is the support from the orchestra. Karajan is supposed to have enormous experience in opera works, even before he dictated the Berlin Philharmonic. Well, it's rather mechanical and without much life: as a dancing partner, he is hopeless. If Furtwangler is to get an A+, the most he can get is a C+ when Karl Bohm & Solti will at least get a B+/A-.  Karajan is much better on his own, and certainly at his best doing Mahler, where we don't sense any living organism nor direction, but just volume and colours. Its sad to say that here Mahler's criticism of Puccini, dispensing him as just a composer who knows some orchestration ( and no more ) seem well justified...

While this production does have possibly some of the best singing of any, I had to wonder whether the director purposely intended to make some sort of comic parody or caricature of Puccini's opera. If this was his intention, then he perhaps succeeded. A number of unfortunate choices in staging, costuming, and characterization made it all but impossible (for me, anyway) to take the characters or their tragic situation seriously. Goro looked like some great buffoonish clown, and Cio-Cio-San's mother like a vacant-minded old hag; not one of the characters seemed remotely Japanese to me. Then, there are the American and Japanese puppets Freni toys with, the child who is shown well before the dramatic revelation to Sharpless, and faithful Susuki actually ASSISTING Butterfly with the suicide! The overall effect seemed closer to farce, or mockery, than high drama and serious tragedy appropriate to the story.
Worst of all, for me, the consul Sharpless, presumably the moral backbone or conscience of the piece, manages to come off nearly as spinelessly degenerate as Pinkerton himself. When Goro offers to show him his selection of mail-order brides, so far from ""laughingly declining""- as the script indicates- he puts on his spectacles; he asks Butterfly about whether she ""has any sisters"", with a grin and a twinkle that would have had me wanting to lock my own baby sister away somewhere safe (one rather wonders why he bothers to warn Pinkerton against toying with his marriage and his bride, at all); he puffs distractedly away at a cigarette while trying to read Pinkerton's letter. One of the more affecting incidental details of the 1996 film version by Mitterand (Troxell and Huang) is toward the end when Sharpless takes away a bottle from Pinkerton with which he, Pinkerton, has been dosing himself when he realizes what he's done; here, however, it is the consul who is seen fortifying himself in the crisis with the contents of a similar bottle.
All in all, I could not find anything in this film to recommend it- beyond, again, some excellent singing, which its negative points for me far outweighed. I found it an embarrassing travesty of Puccini's masterpiece.",1023062400,4,2372,4.992424242424242
1641914,3,B00005OC06,"The advent of opera on DVD has been a real boon to neophytes and aficionados of opera alike, as it presents the medium in a way that can only be superseded by a trip to the opera house itself. This Madama Butterfly is a film version of Puccini's beloved opera, and as such it takes certain liberties (obvious lip-synching, and singing when the actors are clearly not singing--the music represents thoughts ""in their heads"").  While all of this can be somewhat of a distraction, it is the poor acting, especially of Domingo, that hinders my being able to suspend reality while watching this production--in spite of some outstanding singing from Freni,  Ludwig AND Domingo. Evidence of poor acting begin early on when the viewer actually witnesses Domingo's Pinkerton CHEWING GUM (!) over a stretch of several minutes--very strange indeed, and HIGHLY annoying. Was this a conscious decision or was it a gross oversight? My guess is the latter, for I find nothing artistic or symbolic in it; but it is such inexcusable distractions that ruin portions of this opera for me.  It is as if Domingo is trying too hard to make us loath his character. This is most unfortunate, as  Domingo sings AND acts brilliantly in Rosi's film version of Carmen, which he did about a decade after Butterfly.  While Freni certainly does not look 15, few Butterflys do, and who cares when they sing so ravishingly as she? Freni gives a beautifully convincing performance, and her scenes are the most thrilling by far. The sets and backgrounds are acceptable although for a flim version, they fail to evoke an intense  ""Japanese"" flavor the way those in Rosi's film version of Carmen do for Andaluca. In conclusion, opera on DVD places more demands on a production: to be truly outstanding, the VISUAL (acting/sets/backgrounds) component must be equal to the singing.

At first this looks like a 60's movie with voiceover. Placido looks a little like an Italian Hercules. But as time grows on you realize that they actually did a pretty good job of staging. There are plenty of implications that are not in the songs; so the story is better fleshed out than many of the stage versions. Naturally this film can not compete with live performances but it defiantly is worth it for the music and they are not dressed up in bug suits with antenni. This movie does gibe the impression that Puccini did not like Americans.",1507507200,4,1178,4.7745098039215685

7949191,4,B00005OC06,"I was introduced to Madama Butterfly by Renata Scotto, and after 40+ years of listening to/watching the opera, I still believe her portrayal stands above all others. I purchased this version with some trepidation, but since I already own the Domingo La Traviata, I had a feeling he wouldn't put his name on a performance that was less than a great effort. Freni is a contemporary of Scotto, a lyric soprano from the old school, so I took a chance.  Watched it last night for the first time, and it was wonderful, in some parts heartbreaking and riveting.  What a pleasant surprise.

Freni gives a wonderful vocal/acting performance, as does Domingo in the first act.  The third act I found his acting over the top in pathos, and would have pitched him over the side of the ""Abrahmo Lincoln."".  I gave this a 4-star instead of 5 because there are moments in the DVD, when the characters are singing, but the actors are not.  Also, given the description of the Pinkerton's son, ""with golden curls"" and the child in the performance is anything but, it diluted the effect.  But I'm nit-picking.

Ponnelle's production puts Butterfly into American clothing of the period after she marries Pinkerton, which adds to the tragedy as she tries to become the ""American"" bride.  The ""Humming Chorus"" and Butterfly, as she is waiting for Pinkerton, imagining her American life as his wife, is well-done and especially tragic, since you can see in Freni's portrayal, at this point she dreams but does not believe.

The casting of Christa Ludwig, another old pro from the old school, was well done.  Her voice blends beautifully with Freni in the ""Flower Duet"" and she also gives a believable performance as the loyal servant/friend to Cio-Cio San.

FInally, in closing, since the recording was under the baton of von Karajan, you can judge for yourself, the performance, the tempo, the vocal nuances are all there.  To use an old adage, ""they don't make 'em like they used to.""

A DVD that's worthy to add to your collection.",1492819200,5,2011,4.77456647398844
