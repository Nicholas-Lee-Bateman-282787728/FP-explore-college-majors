If I ever had a serious medical condition, I would want Dr. Gannon In charge for sure!  I waited for (literally) dacades for this series to come out on DVD.  This series is the pilot for many other medical shows of the 70's and 80's.  Can't wait for season 2 to come out!",1317427200,9,406,4.2894736842105265
4660898,5,B005DLN1LG,"I saw this series when it was first shown on TV.  The issues addressed are just as relevant now as they were 50+ years ago when this series was first aired.  This ground-breaking series dealt with subjects such as abortion, complex family relationships, hysterical illnesses, witchcraft and homosexuality--subjects that were all but taboo in the 1960's.  These subjects were dealt with in a sensitive, objective manner and the performances by Chad Everett and by James Daley were superb. I recommend this series to anyone interested in watching classic TV that avoids the overflow of vulgarity, rudeness, and disrespect included in so much of modern-day television.  I hope WB will release this series in its entirety.",1314576000,28,718,5.217391304347826
4660899,4,B005DLN1LG,"Warner Brothers has done a really nice job packaging this First Season set of Medical Center. The transfers are clean and sharp, and the sound quality is good as well. More importantly though we get to relive(or see for the first time) some serious TV drama from this time period. Although most of it is dated and a bit melodramatic, that is part of the fun! The outstanding roster of guest stars is the best part for me. I just wish there were some extras/commentary to accompany this great little time capsule. I look forward to purchasing the Second Season of Medical Center when it becomes available. Recommended.",1314230400,21,617,4.722222222222222
4660900,5,B005DLN1LG,I admire the show and its nice to see on dvd but everyone isn't going to be able to afford it. 5 stars for video but 1 star on affordability.,1313884800,5,141,3.7333333333333334
4660901,1,B005DLN1LG,"I purchased this set from Warner Brothers (not knowing it would be sold by Amazon or I would have waited).  Although there was nothing on the page I ordered from on the WB website, their MOD DVDs do not play on most PCs.  Once I received the DVDs and could not get them to play in my PC I found in very small print at the bottom of the box a statement saying ""These discs are expected to play back in DVD video ""play only"" devices and may not play back in other DVD devices, including recorders and PC drives"".  I did finally find this on the WB website under FAQ.  I think this should be prominently displayed on every page or at the very least at some point before you actually order and pay for it.  I have now spent $50 for just one season and didn't earn enough rights with my $50 to watch it on the device I choose.  Since Amazon is using the same wording for their set, ""MOD"", I assume their DVDs also will not play on a PC, although I see no warning on their website.  As for the show itself, it is my all time favorite.  Too bad I can't watch it:(",1313020800,6,1056,4.019138755980861
4660902,5,B005DLN1LG,"I grabbed this up as soon as it was released from the warner site. Watched all but the last disc so far. The picture and sound thus far are very good. It has reminded me of why I loved it when I was younger-great writing, alot of drama along with each medical patient, fabulous guest stars, and a great cast. The medical issues and the issues surrounding the medical trauma in each patient are dealt with in a very caring and wise manner by Dr. Joe Gannon(Chad Everette) and Dr. Paul Lochner(James Daly). This show reminds me a lot of Quincy, another show I love to watch, but with a coroner instead of a doctor. Please release the rest of the seasons of Medical Center on DVD, the first one is fabulous.",1312934400,2,704,4.340909090909091
4660903,5,B005DLN1LG,"Ive waited a very long time for this show to be released, and am thrilled with the finished product. Takes you back to a different time and place (the first show stars O. J. Simpson in a fairly good performance), but as always the show shines due to performances by Chad Everett and James Daly, and a truly amazing supporting cast. The special guest stars are a who's who of old studio system stars and supporting players, many of whom disappear from view after this.  What today we take for granted as to attitudes on social issues, these subjects were brand new in our social discourse in the late 60's,  early 70's. Always handled with special care without being overly preachy, the writers took risks at the time that other shows often did not (re: Marcus Welby MD - another treat from the time). I look forward to the next season and beyond, Warner Bros Archives willing. Highly recommended!!",1312848000,42,897,4.635220125786163

4660914,5,B005DLN1LG,"NOTHING ELSE COMPARES  This show is in a league with Quincy & Marcus Welby.  Upon watching this, viewers, especially non Baby Boomers, will experience medical drama at its finest.  I've seen these shows when they aired on tv and recall the quality of acting and photography.  This is in a league with QUINCY and with MARCUS WELBY MD.  I particularly enjoy seeing some of the vintage automobiles in the background.  Aside from the nostalgia, there something here for modern audiences (in spades).  The  show's acting and spirit  hold up remarkably well.  Even the topicality is still controversial (abortion, drugs, transgender).  Now place those topics 40 years ago and you are in for a treat of a fire storm.

FOR THOSE SCARED OF THE PRICE TAG, what does a single night out on the town cost you now?  Movies, snacks for 2 people, gas, parking, etc  can run you at least $50, and if you go out to eat, forget about it!  I don't do movie theaters anymore, I prefer to own the show and get MANY NIGHTS of entertainment, vs just 1 night on the town - - both for the same cost.

Enjoy & buy'em all, well worth the cost.  I'm taking the plunge right now and going for all 5 seasons available, waiting for the next releases when they come online.",1420588800,,1240,4.488789237668161

4660924,5,B005DLN1LG,"Obviously being from the 70's, the show in some respects is very dated, from the music, dress, and even some of the storylines and sub-plots.....but make no mistake, Medical Center was cutting edge for it's time with regard to most topics it hit on, from child abuse to homosexuality to transgenderism to V.D....you name it. Also in most cases the medical conditions that were discussed were done so accurately and at least in some clinical detail. James Daly as Paul Lochner played a perfect conservative foil to Joe Gannon's ""no-holds-barred"" personality. And there were so many great guest stars....William Shatner, Lois Nettleton, Martin Sheen, Lee Grant, Ed Asner, Jack Carter, the list goes on and on.

I noticed most of the reviewers here seem to be women and almost all have something to say about Chad Everett's sex appeal. OK.... we get it. Hopefully the positive reviews are based on more substance than that! For the record, we men weren't entirely cheated out of eye candy on the show either....for one example, Sheila Larken, who played a nurse/psychologist on a number of episodes, was more than easy on the eyes! But nostalgia-wise this is a great series, and season 1 has a very clean video transfer as well. I plan on getting all the rest of the series in the near future, these are a treat.",1404086400,2,1309,4.792035398230088
4660925,5,B005DLN1LG,Amazon has the Medical Cener Series and I have them all.  Chad Everett was great as Dr. Gannon I love it.,1403481600,,105,4.0
4660926,4,B005DLN1LG,"With a cool funky theme song featuring a dive bomber sound effect, Medical Center (1969-75) was a program that I remember occasionally watching when it was originally broadcast.  Dealing with serious often life threatening issues, it was not the kind of show that would generally be of interest to a kid, however revisiting this series now, it's easy to understand the program's appeal.

Medical dramas were nothing new to television, but this one featuring the young and handsome Chad Everett as doctor Joe Gannon, was a little different.  Driven by strong moral and philosophical convictions, Gannon was physician prone to dramatic and fiery behavior.  His proactive and often emotional approach, often makes for some pretty compelling viewing.

Airing on CBS, the program was set at a facility located on the campus of a university in southern California, where doctor Paul Lochner (James Daly) serves as the head administrator.  Built on mutual respect and trust, the relationship between Lochner and Gannon, is one of the series' key elements, as the Lochner has to balance medical issues, against the practical and legal concerns of running a hospital.  Both Daly and Everett are terrific, consistently delivering compelling performances.

The situations presented are often provocative, and highly emotional, and the program usually takes an in-depth look at the patients and others involved, helping to establish a solid connection with the viewer.  Medical Center benefits from a wonderful guest cast from the era, as the hospital provides an excellent setting to feature characters from diverse backgrounds, and ethnicities.  Facing emotionally charged situations, the actors rise to the occasion, and deliver some special performances.

Like many medical shows, things often get overdramatic, and some of the situations are a bit clichd, but Medical Center usually manages to touch the heart in some fashion.  With emotions running high, and lives on the line, the steely-eyed Gannon, is a white knight in a lab coat, a caring physician that most of can only dream about having.  It's easy to see why the late Chad Everett was such a heartthrob at the time, It's easy to see why the late Chad Everett was such a heartthrob at the time,

The quality of the writing is very good, and while many of the themes are still relevant today, the series also very much reflects the time when it was produced, in terms of medicine, technology, and social conventions, such as the effects of illegal drugs.

The 6 DVD set features 26 episodes, which while not subtitled, do look remarkably good, with almost no signs of dirt or print damage.  The only disappointment for me was that Season One does not feature the ""dive bomber"" theme.  Both Medical Center, and ABC's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Marcus-Welby-M-D/dp/B000SMNK16/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Marcus Welby M.D.</a>&nbsp;premiered in 1969, and the timing was apparently right for medical dramas, as both programs did well in the ratings, and would run for seven seasons.  Marcus Welby became the most popular show on television during the 1970-71 season, with Medical Center coming in at a very respectable #8.",1402099200,,3216,5.359840954274354

4660930,5,B005DLN1LG,"I got the first two seasons as a Christmas gift. I just ordered the third season since I have finished watching the first two seasons. The sets are very well done. It is so much fun to watch these episodes as I was only a kid when they originally aired and was not allowed to stay up on a school night to watch. I had to wait for summer reruns. Therefore, many of these I actually saw for the first time. It is so fun to remember what life was like back in the 70s. It is neat to see all the changes and realize many of the issues then are still issues now. I had such a crush on Dr. Joe Gannon as a kid and let's just say, if I woke up in an ER to those blue eyes I would feel instantly better! LOL! They are definitely worth the money!! I recommend the sets to anyone who loved Medical Center, I guarantee you won't be disappointed.
As a side not, the only issue I had was if I chose the 'play all' feature my discs would start not playing right in about the third episode. I don't know if it is a problem with my player (though it is new) or with the discs themselves, however, when I played each episode separately I had no issues whatsoever.",1390176000,,1146,3.9869565217391303
4660931,4,B005DLN1LG,"The remastered first season discs ran pretty well except for the 3rd episode on disc one.  I've tried on two players now and can't get that episode to play.  The sound and picture quality are decent though the audio is inconsistint and muddy at times.

Medical center was a childhood favorite of mine.  It has been over 30 years since I've seen the show so all the plots are as new for me.  Wow!  Breathtaking drama featuring tough social issues handled with grace and honesty.  After viewing season one, I do understand why this show doesn't get air time today.  Language and topic are so not politically correct for today's sensibilities.  The network sensors would chop some of these old episodes to ribbons deleting material.  Funny how time changes societal norms.",1384646400,2,769,4.801526717557252

4660936,5,B005DLN1LG,"I bought this set for my wife who remembered watching the show as a kid with her family, like I watched ""EMERGENCY!"" with mine but I couldn't find it available anywhere but on Amazon. I had never seen the show so it so it's all new to me, and I actually am enjoying watching the available seasons with her.
With this first season it is quite the social commentary of the ""issues of the day"", in this case 1969, as they relate to 2013. Some episodes are honestly hilarious at times looking back with todays standards in mind, as even Joe Gannon while probably a suave and fancy dresser for that era looks out of place with the dress and style of today. And the 'wild teens' of that era all wearing 'nice clothes'? Ties and sport coats abound but it is still a good show.
Honestly this is better fare than so much of what's on TV now with so many 'reality shows'.
So, after all this ramble, the 26 episodes look great with excellent transfers to DVD, the color is also great, actually better than I recall for color TV's back in that era, when I was about 12. There are no extras whatsoever just the episodes but you can like I did research the series on line and find out information about the show and stars. Oh and a lot of stars from the 1980s and beyond apparently got an early start with this series, it's interesting to see them before they became real stars, or villains in the case of O.J. Simpson in the premiere episode.",1374019200,3,1429,4.296296296296297

The shows are very well written and very captivating.  Couldn't wait until it came out on DVD and felt like it took forever.  Unfortunately when I received it - it didn't work.  I don't understand why this show is not done in normal DVD standards.  I didn't realize it wouldn't work in my DVD/VHS combo.  I never saw the disclaimer until today when I was looking at Season 2 and wondering why it was so expensive.  If I put the disk in my portable DVD player first and then put it in my DVD/VHS combo it will work.  This is truly disappointing especially since I love this show but will not buy Season 2 because of this.  That is also why I only gave it 4 stars.  Does anyone know why it was done in this format?

4660952,5,B005DLN1LG,"In the late 60's and early 70's this show was my all time favourite. When the first season was recently released I purchased it immediately, and was instantly transported back to my early teens. The DVD's were of very good quality, although the sound had to be turned up quite a bit on my player, but that aside, I was impressed with the picture, and general good quality of the DVD's. More than that, I was very impressed with the technical aspects of the show that one did not fully appreciate when 12 years of age. I am now in the medical field and everything in the show is quite accurate. I was totally surprised.. a show before its time and better than some of the medical shows around now. Many important issues of the time were brought to light, and watching these years later is very interesting. Of course, it helped considerably that the star of the show, Chad Everett was extremely handsome, and a very good actor bringing compassion and caring to the role of Dr Joseph Gannon. It was very sad to hear of his recent passing. I look forward to the other six seasons being released and they cannot come quickly enough for me. Definately a must have ! Thank you for the joy in reliving my childhood memories and for the good quality of the First Season set of DVD's for ""Medical Centre"".",1346976000,2,1296,4.449579831932773
4660953,5,B005DLN1LG,I love this series....cannot wait for the Season 2.  Loved this show growing up and nothing has changed.  Wish more doctors had the same caring as Dr. Joe Gannon.........I know it's just a show but it is great.,1346025600,,210,4.5
4660954,5,B005DLN1LG,I have always had great success in buying dvds from Amazon.com and this one is no exception.  I watched Medical Center as a child and love Chad Everett and am sorry that we have lost this wonderful actor.  The dvd is wonderfully remastered and the shows are as I remembered.  Please give us more seasons of this wonderful show!,1346025600,,327,4.508474576271187
4660955,5,B005DLN1LG,"Having just purchased the first season of Medical Center, I have waited for years for this show to be released on DVD.  I had such fond memories of watching it when I was a child.  Like many positive reviewers, the show took you right back to the era.  The acting is superb, the guest stars are mega-talented and many of them are from the Golden Era of Hollywood.  In some ways the episodes are still timely - I am amazed at how little progress has been made with cancer treatment.  However, some episodes are dated (in a good way) and deal with racial prejudice and the ""sterilization board"" where a woman needed the approval of her husband and the mostly male staff of the medical board to get her tubes tied!!!! It really reminds us how far we have come in 40 years!!!!  Enjoy I give it my highest rating.",1345939200,,808,4.3533333333333335
4660956,5,B005DLN1LG,"Have so far watched all but the last disc.  I am impressed with the quality of the picture and sound.  So far have only seen one little glitch on the screen, was expecting a lot of those, but it's very clean.

It's been really fun seeing the steady stream of familiar faces on the screen.  Martin Sheen, Richard Thomas, Forrest Tucker, Jayne Meadows, Bruce Davison, Charlotte Stewart, and many many more.  It's like old home week watching these episodes.

I was eight years old when this show came on the air, and I watched it faithfully.  For some reason my mother felt it appropriate for an eight year old! NOT!  Even now the subject matter is not well suited for young children.  But perhaps Mom decided it was important to indulge my immediate crush on Dr. Gannon.

I am 51 years old now, and I still possess the photo of Chad Everett that was sent to me in response to a fan letter I sent to him when I was 12 years old.

I hope the other seasons will make their way to DVD eventually.  Having just one season available seems like such a tease.

Dr. Gannon still rocks with those blue eyes and tight pants! LOL!",1345939200,6,1116,4.333333333333333
4660957,5,B005DLN1LG,"Enjoyed watching Season 1, all 26 episodes - that's a RUN TIME of 1300 minutes (Amazon Product Details have the Run Time at 600 minutes which is incorrect).

The following is a copy from a posting on the Warner Archive Facebook page which indicates Season 2 isn't too far away. HOORAY.

""Warner Archive Collection We recently finished remastering S2 and it will be available soon. We'll probably start remastering work on S3 shortly thereafter.

Many of these older shows (like this one) are so much better than all the reality shows and comedy shows on now that really aren't funny or entertaining.",1342569600,,308,4.618181818181818
4660960,5,B005DLN1LG,"Having purchased the pilot movie and Complete First Season of this fantastic series, I have been able to re-live some favourite tv viewing moments as a kid.  The opening beating heart sequence had an immediate impact on me, and truly indicated how forward thinking the storyline coverage of this tv series was.  I have since been introduced to such series as ""Medical Story"", """"St. Elsewhere"" and the phenomenal ""Chicago Hope"", ""ER"", and ""Three Rivers"".  These have all impacted on me greatly, but an episode from Medical Center's second season titled ""Trial By Terror"" remains freshly in mind, where Dr. Gannon is involved in an automobile accident - risking permanent blindness by his injuries.  Please (p l e a s e) Warner Archive, bring this fan favourite a Second Season dvd release real soon!!!!",1341273600,2,801,5.0
4660961,1,B005DLN1LG,"Once again,another dvd set that all disc comes up disc errors,for $46.91 i expect product to work. I filing complaint with BBB &DA office. Don't Buy from amazon,they suck!",1339200000,2,171,4.931034482758621
4660962,4,B005DLN1LG,"I purchased this DVD set with an Amazon Gift Card. Watching these videos, I know now why CBS scheduled this series at 9:00 p.m. in Los Angeles, because by that time little kids would be asleep, and the adults could watch this medical drama.  There's no way as a little kid I would have understood this.

I was impressed with the quality, the content, the medical terminology, and the seriousness of Medical Center.  The majority of Medical Center is new to me, since I had only seen a few episodes in syndication as a teenager in the 1980's.  Like other reviewers mentioned, issues were covered tactfully, and I applaud the Respect Life aspect that Dr. Gannon upheld in several episodes (I don't think you would see that on Gray's Anatomy). Dr. Gannon and his colleagues also show the human side of medicine, where external factors and family issues are explored.

I know Chad Everett spent a great deal of time researching and preparing for the role of Dr. Gannon.  Oftentimes, he would go on rounds with real-life medical students, interns, and residents, as well as watch surgeries.  I read that real-life nurses and a real-life anesthesiologist were often used in the operating room scenes.

While the show does look a little dated, but I always like to see the old big cars, particularly a black Chrysler Imperial and the old smooth riding Cadillac Ambulances. I happened to notice some Brown Bomber uniforms too on the ambulance drivers.  It took me about 20 minutes to recognize guest stars Tom Skerritt and Robert Pine (I recognized Walter Koenig immediately as a 4th year medical student), and I kept waiting for guest star Pat Hingle to call Batman on the telephone.  I was also impressed with the lady psychiatrist - Dr. Jeanne Bartlett - that Dr. Gannon would date occasionally (she was good looking too - I never heard of Corinne Camacho before Medical Center), and I did see the episode where Chad Everett's real-life wife Shelby Grant appeared when he went on vacation.  It is impressive that she and Chad Everett were married for 45 years until death do us part.

""The Center"" reminded me of some of the older hospital buildings that were still around in Houston and San Antonio (particularly Methodist Hospital) when I was in college.  The outside shots for ""The Center"" were UCLA Medical Center in Westwood, adjacent to the UCLA campus.  This allowed for location use of the campus settings. This set was also used for a ""Medical Story"" episode that I recall seeing on late night TV one night in the mid-1980's. Today (2012), ""The Center"" hospital building is still there, but I believe it has been remodeled and is now a research/office/classroom institute since the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center opened across the street.

While I would have liked to have seen Dr. Brackett appear in a cameo (I know Emergency! was a different network and Johnny and Roy were part of LA County FD, not LA City FD), this was an excellent drama series.  Hopefully, season 2 of Medical Center will be released soon. Please watch this series, Hollywood needs to bring quality shows like Medical Center back to television.",1335052800,17,3124,4.800373134328358

4660964,5,B005DLN1LG,I missed watching this show since the 1970s.  It has taken to long for you to put it out on dvd. But I was so excited to finally get season one.  I wish you would hurry and put out season 2.  It was as good as I remember.  thank you.,1330473600,8,233,3.6
4660965,5,B005DLN1LG,"Growing up during the 60's and 70's was a great time and a period of great TV. One of the groundbreaking shows from that era was Medical Center. A well written show with a great cast, the show follows the lead character Dr. Gannon played by Chad Everett through different types of medical cases and scenerios. This show was a prelude to medical shows that would come later such as ER and House while not as graphic in nature. It's been a long wait for this TV show to make it to DVD. A long wait indeed but finally this classic medical drama can be enjoyed by all.",1330128000,2,564,4.231481481481482

As only the First Season is available at this time, I hope and encourage the following Six Seasons be made available soon!  I would definitely buy them!  I loved the show as a teen, and watching it again has been a lot of fun.  I would highly recommend this DVD!",1329350400,12,532,4.377551020408164

4660968,5,B005DLN1LG,What a great DVD.  Received the DVD rather quickly.  Medical Center was way ahead of its time with great story lines and such a good looking Doctor. I fell in love with Chad Everett 40 years ago and after watching fell in love all over again.  LOOKING forward to the rest of the seasons.,1325548800,,287,4.277777777777778
4660969,5,B005DLN1LG,"I was very pleased to see that the full first season of ""Medical Center"" was released on DVD and I scooped it right up.  Chad Everett is in fine form as the highly regarded, passionate and humanistic physician, Dr. Joe Gannon.  Gannon is a constant advocate for his patients and ensures they get the care and treatment that is best for them.  As drama would have it, Gannon runs up against an antagonist in almost every episode.  Dr. Gannon almost always wins out.  His older boss, Dr. Paul Lochner, is earnest but not as talented medically as Dr. Gannon.  Lochner is more of a bureaucratic administrator who ensures that he reins in Dr. Gannon just enough to ensure he doesn't get into trouble.  The storylines are ground-breaking for the time and are compelling and well-written.  This was when television used highly professional, mature writers who could deliver the material without dumbing it down for the audience.  The guest actors and actresses are also top-notch and add greatly to the success of this show.  As always, Chad Everett delivers outstanding performances in every episode.  I noted that in the first season, the dynamic opening theme and sequence is not yet around.  I think it started in the second season.  It really gets one in the mood for the show.  Also, I should add my profound condolences to Chad Everett who lost his lovely wife Shelby earlier this year in Westlake Village.  Chad, I'm sure your wife was proud of your terrific work in this series.",1321574400,,1480,4.771653543307087

8467171,5,B005DLN1LG,"As a kid, I was a dedicated Tom Mix, Hoot Gibson, Gary Cooper, John Wayne, & Fess Parker kind of guy. It took a really good and interesting show to pry me away from the western genre. But Medical Center was among the few shows that somehow managed to do that. (Along with other notables as Twilight Zone and Dick Van Dyke). Looking back, I think it was the intelligent banter and dialog that hooked me.

It was season 2! yes the cover and the discs said season 1 but when i played it the episodes were all from season 2. Of course I should have checked them out immediately. So some friendly advice. Please open the discs you purchase and don't merely assume they're what they're purported to be. this was all my fault for not immediately checking. this purchase of season 1 will complete my set for the series of Medical Center. I can say WB discs are invariably of the highest quality. {Yes I did check out the other seasons and there was no mistakes or wrong years on them.} I am looking forward to going through all the episodes in order when I get my season !. 4 stars pending the arrival of my discs where I will upgrade to 5 stars if discs found to be satisfactory It was was just one of those glitches which happen sometimes. I will be updating my review when I get my discs, so will be in pre-op until then. I just received my copy of Medical Center season 1 and my post-op evaluation of the patient is now at 5 stars.
