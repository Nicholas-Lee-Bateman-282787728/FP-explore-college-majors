The Undertaker def. A-Train w/ Sable
(Stephanie McMahon got into the action against Sable near the end of the match. A-Train pulled Sable outta harm's way, though.)
Shane McMahon def. Eric Bischoff
(Bischoff got help from Coach while Shane recieved some from Stone Cold. Great match.)
US Title Match: Eddie Guerrero def. Chris Benoit, Tajiri, Rhyno
WWE Heavyweight Title Match: Kurt Angle def. Brock Lesnar
(Angle made Lesnar submit via the ankle lock. Fantastic brawl.)
Kane def. Rob Van Dam

Elimination Chamber World Heavyweight Title Match: Triple H def. Goldberg, Chris Jericho, Shawn Michaels, Randy Orton, Kevin Nash
(Probably the most exciting matchup of the night. Triple H [stole] Goldberg out of the title after nailing him with a sledgehammer. HHH, Randy Orton, and Ric Flair proceeded to massacre Goldberg after the match)

1891601,3,B00009W0UE,"As a member of Amazon.com, I am obviously the first person to write a REAL review on this video! Currently, the other four reviews concerning this video are false, since Summerslam didn't even take place until last night (Sunday, August 24).
So, as a true member, I will write a serious review on WWE Summerslam 2003.
Summerslam 2003 was a good PPV. It wasn't perfect. It had a lot of flaws and disappointments. Here's a list of the matches with a star rating for each:
WWE Tag Team Championship
La Resistance vs. Dudley Boyz - these stupid anti-American tag teams are in bad taste! I understand the fact that wrestling need good guys & bad guys, but patriotic tag teams like La Resistance is not just bad, but it's not even necessary as far as entertainment goes. The Dudleys dominate most of the match, then get cheated & lose the match due to outside interference. A terrible way to start out a big PPV like Summerslam. **
The Undertaker vs. A-Train - this match was a little bit better, with two big heavyweights battling it out. Not bad for a big man match, as both men put forth quite an effort. Still, nothing new here. **1/2
Eric Bischoff vs. Shane McMahon - this so-called ""match"" wasn't much of a match at all. There was a lot of mic work done throughout the match. However, it was quite interesting.  Announcer Jonathan Coachman makes a surprise heel turn when he interferes in the matchup on Eric's behalf! S. C. Steve Austin comes down and also gets involved in the situation. This was great entertainment! ***
Fatal-Fourway match
Rhyno vs. Tajiri vs. Eddie Geurerro vs. Chris Benoit - this was a very good matchup. A lot of athleticism and talent involved here. I wish it could've been longer. But it was still enjoyable nonetheless. ***3/4
WWE Smackdown Championship match
Kurt Angle vs. Brock Lesnar - this was easily the best d@mn match on the card. Lots of great countering, athleticism, and moves are displayed in this awesome bout. The match drags on a little bit and doesn't carry the same flow as their match at Wrestlemania 19. Still, a ton of effort from both competitors makes this match very good! ****
No-Holds-Barred match
Kane vs. Rob Van Dam - this was probably the 3rd best match on the card. Kane actually had a pretty good matchup with RVD. Don't expect a bunch of BIG bumps or anything. Just an average bloodless brawl between two fierce guys. Rob Van Dam sold his character quite well. Weapons such as a ladder, a chair, and the ring steps were used. Enjoyable, but not a classic. ***1/4
Elimination Chamber match for the WWE Raw Championship
Triple H vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Kevin Nash vs. Chris Jericho vs. Randy Orton vs. Goldberg - this match had a lot of hype going into it. Unfortunately, the match just didn't quite live up to it's hype like it should have. Last year's Elimination Chamber at Survivor Series was off the page, and possibly the greatest 6-man matchup ever! But this Elimination Chamber match just didn't have the magic that last year's did. Chris Jericho & Shawn Micheals started the match off very well, and showed a lot of great athleticism. Triple H and Goldberg didn't get involved until the very end! This match only lasted 20 minutes long! That's a dirty shame, since last year's lasted 40 minutes! I hate Triple H, who should be called Cripple H! His legs can't work worth a d@mn anymore and he refuses to put anyone over for his freakin' World Heavyweight title. And of course, Cripple H somehow beats Golderg at the end and retains his belt. Wow! Yet another stupid let down! Sure, this match had it's moments, but it lacked in originality to the first one at Survivor Series. Still, the match was watchable, just not as athletic and exciting as it could have been. ***2/3",1061769600,,3738,4.621052631578947
1891602,3,B00009W0UE,"This Slummerslam is held at Phoenix,AZ on Aug 24.2003. I was there.
In short, it is a let down event.
1. La Resistance def. the Dudley Boyz (2/5) for Tag Team Championship
It is a very common match and should not be put on PPV.

2. Undertaker VS A-Train (2/5)
No any surprise. Would be better if Sable really got chokeslam
3. Shane Mcmahon VS. Eric Biscoff(3.5/5)
A decent match
Big move by shane and suprised to see the interference of coach.
It is pretty exciting SCSA came out When audiences were chanting his name.
4. FATAL FOURWAY for U.S. Championship
  Eddie Guerrero VS.Rhyno VS. Tarjiri VS.Benoit (3.5/5)
Good match. Fast pace and nice move by Eddie and Rhyno.

5. Kurt Angel VS. Brock Lesnar WWE Championship(3/5)
Something like that match on Wrestlemania but not that good.
No big move but glad to see Mr. Mcmahon got angelslam on steel
chair at his birthday.
6. Kane VS. RVD (3/5)
Just a so so match. End too soon but nice chair move by RVD.
7. Elimination Chamber for World Heavyweigth Champitonship (3/5)
A let down match.
Goldberg is pretty cool  and Y2J is totally destroyed. But kind of boring
seeing Spear/Jack Hammer over and over again.
Triple H hid in the Chabmer for most of time.
Most anticipated fight between H and Goldberg really s[tin]ks.

Total: 3/5",1061769600,2,1277,4.628318584070796
1891603,3,B00009W0UE,"Okay, first of all, the first four ""reviews"" (by [un]P, A viewer (from Michigan), mattitude, and A viewer (from Somerset)  were written before the event even took place, so don't bother reading them. They are apparently suffering from some form of mental retardation, so look only to this review and others written after it for accurate information.
1. World Tag Team Champions La Resistance def. The Dudley Boyz when their new found friend (Rob Conway, may compete under a new name) interfered.
Okay opener, with pretty good crowd heat.
2. Undertaker def. A-Train.
What one would expect from these two. Taker wins after a chokeslam. Sable tries to distract Taker, who holds her in place for an attack by the returning Stephanie McMahon.
3. Shane McMahon def. Eric Bischoff. Bisch is a good character, but he should not be wrestling. Shane wins with help from Steve Austin after Jonathan Coachman turns heel and attacks Shane. Shane hits Eric with an elbowdrop through the Spanish announce table.
4. WWE United States Champion Eddie Guerrero def. Chris Benoit, Tajiri, and Rhyno. Guerrero wins after Benoit/Tajiri fall to the outside, Guerrero saves himself from a gore by using the title belt, and hit Rhyno with a Frog Splash for the pin. Good match, but it fell way below my expectations.
5. WWE Champion Kurt Angle def. Brock Lesnar Angle gets Lesnar to tap after surviving interference from Vince McMahon, and locking Lesnar in the ankle lock for an extended period of time. Good match, I liked it more than the WrestleMania contest.
6. Kane def. RVD Kane wins clean with a Tombstone on the steps. They tried to tell a good story (RVD throwing everything he can at Kane, who survives), but the match was a bit sloppy (the highlight being Kane's slipping off the top rope).
7. World Heavyweight Champion Triple H def. Goldberg, Randy Orton, Chris Jericho, Kevin Nash, and Shawn Michaels in an Elimination Chamber match. Another okay match, which featured Nash going out in less than 2 minutes, Goldberg destroying everyone and HHH not doing a thing until the finish, which saw him counter a spear with a Sledgehammer shot for the pin. Smarks may not like it, but I enjoyed the psychology of HHH not wanting a part of the match, only getting in two moves, but escaping with his title (plus I hate Goldberg). Look for Goldberg to win the title at Unforgiven though.
In closing, a solid, but not great PPV...",1061769600,,2409,4.804819277108434

All four men collided with Eddies U.S title in great jepeordy.
A decent fast paced match. Rating 7.0

These one time World Tag Team champions collided for the second time with Kane's sadistic man handling temper crossing with RVD's unorthodox high-flying prowess. A great match with a shocking ending Rating 9

Despite constant interfearance from The Big Show,Taker still managed to hold his own against the big man and got back some retribution. Rating 7.5

1891608,3,B00009W0UE,"1. World Tag-Team Championship - Dudley Boyz def. La Resistance
La Resistance really don't deserve to be in any kind of a match at the PPV. It was good to see the Dudleyz get the win to end this long boring feud. Lets hope that La Resistance choke on some Freedom Fries soon. Match was pretty ordinary.*
2. Steel Cage match - Test def. Scott Steiner w/Stacie Kiebler
I laughed ... when Steiner [messed] up the clothesline and Test bumped when Steiner was clearly five feet away. I lost count of how many stupid chair shots. 1/2*

I missed this match. My pop tarts in the toaster were bruning. But I'll bet this was a *** match.
4. Randy Orton def. Shawn Michaels
Notice how Lilian Garcia called Rodney Orton at the beginning of the match? Why is she still under contract? Good match,and the right guy went over. *** 1/2
5. Street Fight- Zach Gowen def. Mr. McMahon
Gowen only has one leg. Talk about swerves. Who saw that one coming? Seriously. Do you reckon they cut off his leg just so he could have a fresh gimmick? DUD
6. Kane def. Rob Van Dam
Kane reminds me of this crazy dentist I used to know. And he kinda looks like Diesel, but you know fake. **
7. Intercontinental Championship(title can change hands on a dq or countout)- Booker T def. Christian
The spinaroonie through the announcers table was insane. ***
8. WWE Championship- Kurt Angle def. Brock Lesnar
It was good to see Brock making up for the missed Shooting Star Press at Wrestlemania by doing 6 in a row. Sure showed the critics. But somehow he still lost. ****
9. World Heavyweight Championship- Goldberg def. Triple H
Afterall all the buildup it was strange that this match lasted only 12 seconds long. What's even stranger is that Yokozuna's old amanger madehis WWE return by throwing dust in Triple H's eyes. DUD",1060214400,,1852,4.581325301204819

Sane vs. Bishoff- This was excatly like Vince v Shane at WM 17 althought i thought this one lacked, lacked a lot. It was really fun watching but i bet you won't want to see this one more than twice in your lifespan.  7/10(being nice)

Elimination Chamber!- This match(sucked). And whomever said that this is better than the one from 2002 is really a complete Moron, well i think his run on sentances and low spelling abilities prove that.

HBK Y2J and Orton did a good job keeping the crowd in the match in between Nash and Goldberg.  I would have liked to see Goldberg and Nash square off again, but Nash(hurt too) was taken out as fast as he came in.  Which left 3 guys half Goldbergs size in the ring.  I must admit, he got the biggest pop when he hit the ring, bigger than his entire time in the WWE.  From there it was vintage Goldberg.  We saw the Goldberg from his WCW days as ""The Man"".  The days when he could knock out 10 guys with a single blow.  Once again Goldberg comes up with a devastating new move, press slam into spine buster, that brings a loud ""ooooohhhhhh"" from the crowd.  The spear into the glass was messed up, but still worth seeing.  Not to mention, it was amazing how far he threw Y2J,(like a lawn dart) from the ring all the way out to the cage wall.  All in all, it was the old Goldberg story, heavy hits, fast matches.  He beat the 3 members in only a few moments, and then the match ended even faster with a hammer shot from HHH... Its like the writers just ran out of stuff to write.  so what if HHH was hurt, the crowd was 110% into Goldberg and wanted to see him beat HHH from post to post.  Ill never understand why the WWE always ruins title matches with stupid endings.  The rest of the show was ok, but this match is why you should buy the DVD.",1127260800,,1477,4.041379310344827

Match One-World Tag Team Championships-Dudleys(C)Vs La Resistance-This match was an alright match except for the ending was very dodgy and shouldn't have been done. This feud hasn't really been that hot so opening the show with it was a fairly good decision. My rating 6.25/10.

Match Two-Undertaker Vs A-Train-This wasn't as bad as most people thought. It has a good storyline and after the match Stephanie McMahon returned to get revenge on Sable. Hopefully this will end the feud and allow Taker to be able to move back in the title scene. My rating 6.76/10.

Match Three-No Disqualification-Shane McMahon Vs Eric Bischoff-This was a good match but I believe they shouldn't have had the match of this before the PPV. Interference from Coach for some odd reason. Still a good solid match overall. My rating 7.48/10.

Match Four-United States Championship-Eddie Guerrero(C)Vs Chris Benoit Vs Rhyno Vs Tajiri-This now this was a great match worth the price of admission. There's four great wrestlers with lots of talent in the ring and it showed well in this match. Hopefully Benoit & Guerrero both get pushes towards the title and/or one switches to Raw so they both get chances. My rating 8.26/10.

Match Five-WWE Championship-Kurt Angle(C) Vs Brock Lesnar-This was an awesome match with a great ending which told a story just like the whole match. Vince McMahon interfered as expected and it was perfect what he did. There was a kind of unneccessary ref bump but this was still a good title match. My rating 7.37/10.

Match Six-No Disqualification-Kane Vs RVD-Another No DQ match, Why WWE why???We could have had just a normal match then had these two again next PPV. They have great chemistry together and they did great spots such as many powerful and high flying moves on the outside plus Van Dam attempted a Coast To Coast Van Terminator. We got a good match between these two and it did what it was meant to. RVD did his good spots and Kane just destroyed him. Kane's been a monster since removing his mask. My rating 7.26/10.

Match Seven-Main Event-Elimination Chamber-World Heavyweight Championship-HHH(C)Vs Y2J Vs Kevin Nash Vs Shawn""HBK""Michaels Vs Randy Orton Vs Goldberg-This match was done to cover up HHHs injury. He didn't wrestle much as he couln't do it without struggle. This was a good match and I don't no why people say its not good. Fair enough its not as good as the first one last year but this is still good. They all did their parts and they all performed awesome and took sick bumps. Nash and Goldberg were like monsters in there. HBK and Jericho worked really hard just like they always do. HHH did the best he could and really contributed as much as he could to this match. Randy Orton was HHHs sidekick and did what he was supposed to do and did a great job. My rating 7.98/10.

The overall score for this show is 51.36/70 which is a nice solid score. That in a percentage is 73.37% which is equal to a B+. The main matches on this card which stood out for me were the Shane Vs Eric,US Title fatal fourway,WWE Title and the Elimination Chamber.

La Restance vs Dudleys Tag Team Championship- Average opener. Nothing to good. The Dudleys are a good tag team to warm up the crowd. They opened so many ppv's for raw. I think SD! should take advantage of that. The Frenchmen retain Match Rating 5

A-Train vs Undertaker- OK big man match. I actaully enjoyed this one. Taker carried him to a good match, not really good but ok match. Taker wins this one. Match Rating 6.5

Eric Bischoff vs Shane O' Mac No DQ - I thought this match would be good but, Shane I don't know he normally puts on a show but with Bischoff I don't think he could. The best thing about this match is when coach turned heel. Shane does his classic elbow drop. Shane wins. Match Rating 5

Fatal 4-way US championship Tajiri vs Eddie vs Benoit vs Rhyno- Pretty good match. Eddie didn't really want to get envolved because of what he did on smackdown earlier that week. Benoit should have won but, Eddie retains. Match Rating 7

Kurt Angle vs Brock Lesnar WWE Championship- Great match. These two know how to wrestle each other. Pretty much like there WrestleMania match but I think it was better. Lesnar taps to the ankle lock. Match Rating 10

NO HOLDS BARRED Kane vs RVD- This was a weird bout. Kane takes off his mask on RAW and just beats RVD's ass. Well this match is ok. A match with Kane is normally not that face paced. Still ok match. Kane wins with the tombstone on the steel steps. Match Rating 7.5

Triple H vs Goldberg vs HBK vs Y2J vs Kevin Nash vs Randy Orton World Heavyweight Championship- Good match but, not as good as the Survivor Series chamber. HBK and Jericho start this out which was a good decision cause these two have classic matches. Then Randy gets in and it sort of becomes a spotfest. Nothing to complain about here. HHH was supposed to come in like third but, he waited till Goldberg was the only one in to come in. The Ric gave him a sledge and Trips nailed him when Goldberg was going for a spear. Trips retains.

LA RESISTANCE defeated THE DUDLEY BOYZ to Retain the World Tag-Team Titles: Well, I suppose the major strength of The Dudleyz right now is their ability to get the crowd involved, so it only made sense that this was the opening match. They controlled about 80-85% of the offense in this 8 minute bout as well, until Rob Conway predictably interfered to keep the titles on the Frenchmen. Passable, if mediocre. Match Rating...5

THE UNDERTAKER defeated A-TRAIN: Hey look, Sable is with A-Train; That must mean he is successful!!! Some of the offense in this bout (especially from 'Taker) was just so terrible. I don't think I've ever seen him look so sloppy. Strangely enough though, this match got better, the longer it lasted. Again, a passable 10 minutes of big-man action, if nothing more. Match Rating...5

SHANE McMAHON defeated ERIC BISCHOFF: Hehe... Coach turned heel!!! I can't remember anything else that happened in the bout, as I was too busy laughing at his turn & JR impressions. Oh that's right, there was the usual Shane-O-Mac suicide spot. Apart from that, this match (for want of a better word) was monotonous & sucked. But Coach turned heel... Hehe. Match Rating...4

EDDIE GUERRERO defeated CHRIS BENOIT, TAJIRI & RHYNO in a Fatal Fourway Match to Retain the U.S Championship: Initially, this was a little bit of a mess & the fourway stipulation (compared to the elimination alternative) looked to be a bad decision. But as the match went on & the the spots got more scripted, this turned into a very good bout. But then at only the 11 minute mark, the match ended & Eddie retained his title. Up & down, this was a good, if slightly disappointing match. Match Rating...7

KURT ANGLE defeated BROCK LESNAR to retain the WWE Championship: Make no mistake about it folks, this was a very good match. Try not to get blinded by the fact that nothing super-duper spectacular happened. This bout came off just very natural, was well paced & had good psychology. A good mixture of everything befitting a title match, all this 22 minute bout needed was that something spectacular. That, and the absence of the botched move, I suppose. Match Rating...9

KANE defeated ROB VAN DAM in a No Holds Barred Match: Hard to critique & even rate a match that went in fits & bursts as much as this one did. I suppose that's the main criticism of RVD. But it's also indirectly his main strength, as his matches often still come off as entertaining, despite all the weaknesses. Kane's botched top-rop spot didn't help this bout out. Match Rating...7

TRIPLE H defeated BILL GOLDBERG, CHRIS JERICHO, SHAWN MICHAELS, RANDY ORTON & KEVIN NASH in an Elimination Chamber Match to Retain the World HeavyWeight Title: I had to rely on Triple H winning here to have a perfect predictions record at this pay-per-view. But guess what??? I didn't want to be perfect tonight. But it doesn't matter what I want, it's what Vince McMahon wants that matters. And on this day, Vince wanted DaveyBoy to be perfect & Triple H to continue on as the World Heavyweight Champion.

Good first half of the match involving Jericho, Michaels, Orton & Nash. I thought the latter 2 were used as well as they possibly could have been in this match. Goldberg's rampage was predictable, but effective. While our Trips didn't really do all that much at all. The ending was way too abrupt & took a rating point off. Surely the Triple H-Goldberg feud will continue to Unforgiven where we will finally have a new champ!!! Match Rating...7

PPV RATING (44/70) = 63

Looking at the key, I have given SummerSlam a 'C+' grade & have said that it was 'Worth A Watch'. That pretty much sums it up well, in my opinion. Nothing was too bad or offensive, but nothing really stood out either. While I felt the Lesnar vs Angle match was very good, it wasn't what you would call a Match Of The Year contender. Everything else was either just passable, or good. I think the fear a lot of us had before the pay-per-view, that the WWE did not concentrate on what many believe to be the 2nd best event of the year, turned out to be true. I definitely have the feeling right now, that they are concentrating on making the brand-exclusive ppv's as successful as possible. Unfortunately for us, SummerSlam got a little left out in the big picture.",1114732800,,4902,4.635524798154556
1891644,3,B00009W0UE,"SummerSlam opened up with members of the US Marines colorguard on the stage while Lilian Garcia sang the National Anthem from inside the ring. After that we saw a highlight package backed by Metallica's ""St. Anger"" and then we were welcomed into the arena with plenty of pyro and screaming fans.

La Resistance defeated the Dudley Boyz to retain the World Tag Team Championships. Decent way to start off the show with the National Anthem just being performed and the Dudleyz coming out as the patriotic team. Crowd was into it for the Dudleyz and after a few nearfalls, a cameraman jumped into the ring and laid out D-Von with a camera, allowing La Resistance to get the win. The cameraman then revealed himself as the phony serviceman that helped out La Resistance on SmackDown! last week. Spike Dudley ran in but wasn't much help and La Resistance left victorious. After the match, Jonathan Coachman got a word with Bubba and Bubba said they would stop at nothing to regain their world tag team championships.

Backstage, Christian complained to Eric Bischoff about not being on the card, despite being the Intercontinental champion. Bischoff blamed it on Austin and told Christian he had to focus for his upcoming match. Christian then asked Bischoff if he ""sealed the deal"" last week when he confronted Linda McMahon at her home. Bischoff said he'd head out to the ring pretty soon and let the whole world know what happened.

Undertaker defeated A-Train (with Sable). Basically a brawl with a slam or a suplex in between plus the normal moves from both guys. Train was able to counter a Tombstone attempt but turned right around into a chokeslam which secured the win for the Undertaker. After the match, Taker wanted to go for the Last Ride but Sable jumped in the ring and tried to seduce the Deadman but he grabbed her by the neck and waited until Stephanie McMahon made her way out. Stephanie tore into Sable for a few seconds before A-Train grabbed Sable and pulled her out of the ring.

Shane McMahon defeated Eric Bischoff. Shane got the early lead and pummeled Bischoff until the two fell to the outside where Jonathan Coachman, of all people, attacked Shane with a chair. From there, Bischoff had JR's and Lawler's headsets turned off so Coachman could call the action inside the ring, and he also turned the match into a no holds barred, falls count anywhere contest. Coach held up Shane for a few kicks until Steve Austin came out to even the odds. Coach told Austin he worked for Bischoff now and Austin couldn't touch him unless he was physically provoked, so Shane shoved Coach into Austin and Coach ended up getting a beatdown. Shane then took a lifeless Bischoff and grabbed his hand so he could slap Austin's face, again provoking him so Austin could nail a Stunner on Bischoff. Shane then took Bischoff to the outside and laid him out on the Spanish announce table, headed up to the top and dropped an elbow through the table for the win. Afterwards, Shane and Austin threw a little beer bash.

Eddie Guerrero defeated Chris Benoit, Rhyno & Tajiri to retain the United States Championship. Good match, very fast paced with every guy taking each other out with signature moves. At one point, Eddie held Tajiri in the Lasso From El Paso while Benoit had Rhyno in the Crossface. The ref bounced back and forth to see who would tap first but eventually the holds were broke. Late in the match, Tajiri took Benoit over the top on a powerbomb attempt while Guerrero hit Rhyno with the Frog Splash to pick up the win.

Kurt Angle defeated Brock Lesnar to retain the WWE Championship. Another good match which saw Lesnar get frustrated early but come back and dominate for a good part of the match. Just when Angle got in control. Vince McMahon ran in and smacked Angle with a chair, which led to an F5 but Angle was able to kick out and slap on an anklelock for the win.

Kane defeated Rob Van Dam. Decent match, looked a little sloppy in parts but overall it wasn't bad. Kane almost strangled himself when he slipped off the top rope and nearly became entangled between the top and middle ropes. The match was also made into a no holds barred match. The steps, a ladder and chairs were used. Late in the match, Van Dam went for a Van Terminator but Kane dodged it and then finished off Van Dam with a Tombstone on the steps.

Triple H defeated Goldberg, Chris Jericho, Shawn Michaels, Kevin Nash & Randy Orton in an Elimination Chamber match to retain the World Title. Jericho and Michaels started it off and worked well for the first few minutes. Orton was the third man in and the three slugged it out inside the ring until Nash entered and took control. Nash went for the powerbomb on Jericho but Michaels nailed Nash with a superkick and Jericho rolled through to eliminate Nash first. Before Nash left though, he powerbombed everyone in sight. Goldberg was then let loose and he demolished everyone in his path, eliminating Orton with a spear and then Michaels with a Jackhammer. On the outside, Goldberg speared Jericho through the plexiglass cell and then later eliminated him with another spear inside the ring. Amidst the chaos, Triple H went to enter but Michaels superkicked him right back into his cell. Finally, when it was down to just Goldberg and H, Flair locked Triple H's cell door but Goldberg kicked through the glass and brought H into the chamber. Goldberg threw H into the chain walls a few times and H bled but once inside the ring, H got ahold of a sledgehammer and clocked Goldberg in mid-spear to retain the title. After the match, Orton and Flair got in the ring and held back Goldberg so H could hit him a few times with the hammer. Goldberg was a bloody mess as they handcuffed him to the chains and beat him down furthermore. Show ended with Evolution standing triumphant over a bloody Goldberg.",1114128000,,5843,4.633204633204633

  La Resistance bores me in every match that their in.  The Dudleyz should have won but Rob Conway screws them. 2/10

Undertaker v. A-Train

  This was a big man's match.  Sable tries to distract Taker but Steph comes down and whacks Sable and Taker wins. 6/10

Shane McMahon v. Eric Bischoff  NO DQ

  This match was made NO DQ by Stone Cold just before it started.  Coach turns on Shane to help Bischoff.  Austin helps Shane and Shane wins. 9/10

Eddie Guerrero v. Chris Benoit v. Rhyno v. Tajiri  U.S. Title

  This was a classic battle of 4 different styles.  Eddie retains but Benoit should have won. 10/10

Brock Lesnar v. Kurt Angle  WWE Title

  This was another jackpot match by Smackdown!  Vince tries to help Brock but Kurt fakes an injury and makes Brock tap to the Ankle Lock. 10/10

Kane v. RVD  NO Holds Barred

  This match is a good fight but RVD sadly couldn't keep up with Kane.  Kane makes RVD bleed bad. 7/10

Triple H v. Goldberg v. Chris Jericho v. Shawn Michaels v. Randy Orton v. Kevin Nash  World Title  Elimination Chamber

  This was not as good as the first Elimination Chamber but it is close.  Goldberg dominates this match until Flair screws him up.  HHH retains and Evolution beats the Hell out of Goldberg. 9/10

Undertaker v. A-Train

  This match was nothing great.  A-Train weighted it down.  Undetaker wins in a typical big man match.**3/4

Shane McMahon v. Eric Bischoff  NO DQ

  This was a very good match with a lot of twists.  Coach screws Shane and helps Bischoff.  Stone Cold helps Shane then leaves.  Shane is ready to do the elbow drop and does to get the win.****

Eddie Guerrero v. Chris Benoit v. Rhyno v. Tajiri  U.S. Title

  This was an incredible match.  Makes up for the first two matches.  Eddie retains in an absolutely incredible match.*****

Brock Lesnar v. Kurt Angle  WWE Title

  This was another awesome match.  Kurt has the Ankle Lock in for so long I thought Brock's ankle was at least broken.  Finally, Brock taps and Kurt wins.*****

Kane v. RVD  NO Holds Barred

  This was an absolute horrible match.  Kane is so dumb.  He tombstone's RVD on steel steps then throws him in the ring and pins him.**

1891677,4,B00009W0UE,"This PPV looked great on paper, but ended up to not be as good as I thought it would be.  It was still very good.

1. La Resistance vs. Dudley Boys (World Tag Titles)

Decent way to kick off the show.  The match was actually pretty good.  Nothing too exciting though.  (7.5/10)

2. Undertaker vs. A-Train

The WWE really tried to give A-Train a chance.  He had many opportunities to prove himself, but he just couldn't put on a good match.  The match is not that good.  (6.5/10)

3. Shane McMahon vs. Eric Bischoff

Very entertaining and surprising match.  Coach turns on Shane in the match.  Very surprising.  The match turns into a No Holds Barred match halfway through.  Austin makes an appearance.  Sick spot when Shane jumps off the top rope and delivers an elbow to Bischoff on an announce table (much like the Wrestlemania 17 move).  (8/10)

4. Chris Benoit vs. Eddie Guerrero vs. Tajiri vs. Rhyno (U.S Title/Fatal Fourway)

Entertaining match, although it could have been so much better.  The match was pretty good, but the end was very sloppy.  (7.5/10)

5. Kurt Angle vs. Brock Lesnar (WWE Title)

Great match.  One of the top ten matches of the year in my opinion.  It was not as good as their Wrestlemania match, but still very good.  Great intensity and emotion in the match.  Vince makes an appearance.  (9/10)

6. Rob Van Dam vs. Kane (No Holds Barred)

It was good for the WWE to add this stipulation.  There was a very funny spot were Kane attempted to jump off the top rope, but he fell.  Only the WWE edited it on the DVD.  RVD really carried the match.  (8.5/10)

7. Goldberg vs. Triple H vs. Chris Jericho vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Randy Orton vs. Kevin Nash (World Heavyweight Title/Elimination Chamber)

Good match, but not as good as the first Elimination Chamber.  It is the last match Nash has had in the WWE.  Different format as the wrestlers came out every 3 minutes instead of 5.  Triple H was injured in the match, but was used well.  Sick Sweet Chin Music by HBK on Triple H.  This was Goldberg's break out performance in the WWE.  He finally became the animal he was supposed to be.  Great spot when he punches through the glass to get to Triple H.  The ending kind of sucks.  (8.5/10)

Good PPV, but it is not an essential to add to your collection.  I would recommend to pick it up, though.

Fatal 4-Way for the U.S. title.  eddie uerrero vs. chris benoit vs. rhyno vs. tajiri

i missed some of this match but i think eddie retained

World tag team championship match La Resistance vs. dudley's

i forgot who won, but i think it was resistance

shane vs. eric bischoff

awomse match, it later turned into no DQ and falls count anywhere when couch interfered and turned heel.  austin soon came out and couch was taunting him when shane pushed him into austin.  Now this was when austin could not attack people unless he was physically provoked.  so then austin beat the crap out of couch.  then shane got bischoff up and made him smack austin, so austin gave him a stunner.  then shane did a flying elbow off the top rope onto bischoff onto the anounce table and won.  shane and sutin then enjoyed a beer bash.  great and funny match

undertaker vs. A-train

pretty boring.  undertaker wins

RVD vs. Kane

right before the match started this was made a no DQ match.  i forgot a lot of what happend but Kane won

WWE Championship match.  Kurt angle vs. Brock lesnar

awsome match, i really like it.  even vince couldn't keep angle from retaining

elimination chamber for the world heavyweight title.  HHH vs. Rnady orton vs. chris jericho vs. goldberg vs. shawn michaels vs. kevin nash

awsome match.  i love the chambers  i don't know the order of elimination but it came down to goldberg and HHH.  flair slid HHH and a sledgehammer and HHH used it to win.  after words, HHH and evolution beat on goldberg",1091836800,,1662,4.488215488215488
1891680,4,B00009W0UE,"1) La Resistance vs. The Dudley Boyz 4 the Tag titles
A nice opener, nice moves and a very intellegent win by la resistance 7/10
2)Undertaker vs. A-Train
A decent match with some good moves, seen better 'taker matches before. Steph taking out her revenge from Sable was cool 6.5/10
3)Shane vs. Eric Bishoff
This was the match that I expected to be a boring brawl between shane and eric but it was d*** entertaining with the interferances of the Coach and Austin. expecially it was so cool when Austin got involved with the match. A classical-and nice Shane ending :P 8/10
4)Fatal 4 way match 4 the US. title
It was a fast match and really fun to watch. Tajiri was expecially good. The last minutes of the match was very  exciting when eddie used the title to block the gore and both tajiri benoit and eddie tried their chances to get the fall but it was eddie who frogged rhyno on the belt to retain his title! God I love eddie:)) 9/10
5)Angle vs. Lesnar for the WWE Undisputed Championship
A very technical match where both lesnar and angle show how talented they are. It was cool to watch Angle insults Brock! The ending was very nice when Kurt taps brock out and this was one of the best matches of the night! 9/10
6)Rvd vs. Kane
A good match but I thought it was not that entertaining. RVD did fought good till the end but it was Kane who tombstoned RD on the steel steps. 7/10
7)Elinination Chamber for the WWE Heavyweight title
This was WAY FAR from the last years elimination chamber match it was SHORT SLOW and NOT ENTERTAINING. I expexted lots of violance and blood (in the end the promos state that this is the product of the devil himself to punish :) but it was no more than a 6 man battle royal match! It is not a bad match but it did not meet my expectations! And also I really don't like golberg, he gets in to the ring and eliminates orton HBK and Y2J yes this guy maybe a very intense wrestler but how can he eliminate 3 wrestlers (HBK and Y2J expecially) when he just enters the ring!!! I also think that Triple H looked very weak but again I prefer HHH to cheat (use the sldge hamer given by Flair to block the spear) to win rather than see goldbeg take out every one in the chamber and be WWE champion. In the end not the main event that was expectecd but still some good in ring action but fails to meet the expextations 6/10
In the end SummerSlam is a very good ppv with  cool wrestling moves and good endings but if you are going to buy his ppv just for the elimination chamber do not but it (unless you are a huge goldberg fan that can withstand seeing him losing). If not for the elimination chamber, buy it",1089676800,,2632,4.251497005988024

1891682,3,B00009W0UE,"Summerslam 2003 offered too many no hold barred matches with few satisfactory winners. Some of the matches are very entertaining to watch while others might have been better on Raw or Smackdown.
World Tag Team Championship Match: La Rsistance v. the Dudley Boyz.
This match was a decent PPV-starting match, culminating to a boring (and relatively predicatble) ending. The Dudley Boyz have lost their zeal to wrestle. (4/10)
Undertaker v. A-Train.
This match was the worst of the night. Watching these two huge wrestlers go at it was a yawnfest as well, and the match never picks up. The ending is better than the match before, but all in all, this is honestly one of the worst Summerslam matches of all time. (2/10)
Shane McMahon v. Raw GM Eric Bischoff
Though not a spectacular manuever-based match, it's one of the most fun matches to watch with some great surprises and a ""happy ending."" (7/10)
US Championship Match: Rhyno v. Chris Benoit v. Tajiri v. Eddie Guerrero
Wow, this match was a lot more than I ever expected. Rhyno is a surprisingly good wrestler, and even though he was a bit heavier than his opponents, watching him in action was impressive. He delivers an awesome spine-buster in the heat of the match. A fun match overall. (10/10)
WWE Championship Match: Brock Lesnar v. Kurt Angle
Another match that turned out to be fun to watch. Kurt did most of the amazing work, and he proved to be a great fan favorite. The match wasn't as good as the Wrestlemania XIX match, but it definitely worked for a Summerslam. (9/10)
Rob Van Dam v. Kane.
Actually, this match was kind of dry. It turned out to be another beat-'em-up-badly match, and it's always fun to see Van Dam's energy, but there was a lack of passion in this match, and the ending is pretty stale. (5/10)
World Heavyweight Championship [Elimination Chamber:] Chris Jericho v. Kevin Nash v. Shawn Michaels v. Randy Orton v. Triple H v. Goldberg.
There are a few couple spots that are entertaining, but the elimination chamber isn't really used. It might as well have been a six-man elimination match. Little blood and a bad conclusion make for a disappointing finale. (6/10)

  Shawn Michaels vs Kevin Nash.  This match could've
  been much better,(maybe Goldberg should learn more than the 3 moves he overused his whole pathetic career.)HHH was Champ, and due to a serious Groin injury he got during a non televised match with Goldberg, was not 100%.  Seeing Goldberg use just the Spear and then the Jackhammer to secure 3 pretty much back to back to back pinfalls was sad. the Beating given by Evolution to a handcuffed Goldberg was the highlight of the match. This was probobly the best part of the match, not only for sheer brutality (don't mess with THE GAME and his trusty Sledgehammer!)but it will put a smile on the face of anyone who feels Goldberg has no in ring talent.  Hey Bill!  Time to go back to wrestling school and see if you can learn 2 more moves to add to the 2 you know.

Undertaker vs A-Trian: WHY GOD? 'TAKER COULD HAVE WRESTLED MARTHA STEWART, AND I WOULD'VE CARED MORE FOR THIS ONE
Shane Mcmahon vs Eric Bishoff, this is helped only by the classic heel tuirn by Jonathan Coachman, as well as Shane's leap into the Spanish Announce Team.
Fatal Four-Way for the United States Title: Eddie Guerrero vs Chris Benoit vs Takiri vs Rhyno, CLASSIC MATCH, SMACKDOWN'S greatest wrestlers next to Angle and Lesner pull off some near-falls and good moments in this match.
WWE Championship: Brock Lesner vs Kurt Angle, Kurt is a wresstling GOD , so is Lesner, together they put on an incredible match with the stupidest ending ever, Lesner should have won the title instead of winning that lame Iron Man Match in September follwing this PPV.
Kane vs Rob Van Dam:I used to like Rob Van Dam before his backstage whining and conduct forced me to look at his matches in ECW, my god he is NOTHING MORE THAN A BUMP MACHINE. Kane rules, and put RVD in his place, if you're a fan of RVD and Kane, you'll like this hardcore style ECW-like bout, but if you don't like RVD, you'll be happy to see Kane beat the crap out of him.
Elimination Chamber Match for the World Heavyweight Championsip: Triple H vs Randy Orton vs Kevin Nash vs Shawn Michales vs Chris Jericho  vs Goldnerg, HORRIBLE CRAP, GOldnerg is hidiously overated and Triple H decided to take a toilet break and pin Goldberg at the end of the match without doing a damn thing.

Match 7)Elimination Chamber match for the World Heavyweight Championship:(c)Triple H vs. Goldberg vs. Chris Jericho vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Randy Orton vs. Kevin Nash
A great Summerslam event! This ppv had 7 matches but it is just as good as 10! Here are the results with a short review:
1)World Tag Team Champions La Restance def. Dudley Boyz
Terrible Opener! It would of been better if the ending was different but the American-turncoat Rob Conway had to screw up the match! How could the referee not see that the foamy camera man was not Conway! Almost a DUD but I'll give it **
2)Undertaker def. A-train
It seems neither Big Show or A-train can defeat the Undertaker! Another great chokeslam finish! Sable tried to interfere but Undertaker... you have to see for yourself! It was funny but the match itself could of been much better. ***
3)No dq: Shane McMahon def Eric Bischoff
A pretty decent match until the Coack destroyes Shane McMahon with a chair manhandeling him! Austin came down and Coach was making fun of him about Austin not being allowed to touch him unless he provokes him and then Shane shoved Coach into Austin and Austin takes out Coach! Then McMahon hits the elbow drop and gets the 3. Due to the interference by Coach I'll give it ***
4)US Champion Eddie Gurrero def. Rhyno, Tajiri, and Chris Beniot
Great match! Eddie and Beniot are truley one of the best wrestlers in the wwe! A good ending even though Beniot lost the match. The ending came when Chris Beniot and Tajiri were out of the ring and Eddie snuck the frog splash on Rhyno amd got the 3! Great peformance by all 4 man in a great match! *****
5)WWE Champion Kurt Angle def. Brock Lesnar BY SUBMISSION!
The best match between these two I have ever seen! YOU TAPPED OUT BROCK! It had an unbelievable ending where Angle had the ankle lock applied for a lone time and Brock still couldn't make the ropes and TAPPED OUT! Kurt Angle finally defeats the real Brock Lesane. Great match! Great ending! *****
6)No Holds Barred match:Kane def. Rob Van Dam
Another great match with a sad ending. I cant believe Rob Van Dame returned after a huge tombstone on to the steele steps! The match ended when it looked like Rob Van Dam was dominate in the match until Kane hit a huge tombstone piledriver inti the steele steps and dragged him into the ring and got the 3. Another great match! **** 1/2
7)Elimination Chamber match:World Heavyweight Champion Triple H def. Goldberg, Chris Jericho, Shawn Michaels, Randy Orton, and Kevin Nash
Not nearly as good as the Survivor Series elimination Chamber match! Here are th order of elimination results:
-KevinNash was eliminated first when he had Jericho up for the jacknife but HBK hit the Sweet Chin Music and Jericho got a roll up and got the 3.
-Randy Orton was eliminated second when Goldberg hit the speare followed by the jackhammer to get the 3.
-Shawn Michaels was eliminated third by Goldberg once again gets the 3 after the sphere then the jackhammer
-Chris Jericho was eliminated Fourth when Goldberg AGAIN hits the sphere folloewd by the jackhammer  to get the 3.
-Goldberg was eliminated last when Ric Flair slid the sledgehammer to Triple H while Goldberg ran for the sphere and Triple H naild Goldberg in the back of his head and got the 3.
At the end, Evolution brutaly assults Goldberg and bloddies him. The poor part in the match is where Triple H gets nailed but stays down for a long time! I'll give this match **** 1/2

1891701,4,B00009W0UE,"-La Resistance (c) vs Dudley Boyz
Another decent match between the new anti-Americans and the many time Tag Team Champions. These guys can work a match to build some excitement, but the obvious ending ruins the match.
**/*****
-Undertaker vs A-Train
Undertaker is a guy that I loved during the dead man gimmick, not the American Bad Ass that he has going on now. I believe that his better days are behind him, and he should set his sights on retiring soon. A-Train is someone I see a lot of potential in, and he showed a lot of it with his gigantic powerhouse moves.
***/*****
Shane McMahon vs Eric Bischoff
Garbage match. Eric should stick to booking matches and being the 'evil' general manager, and steer clear of the ring. As a matter of fact, Shane should also stay out of the ring. I won't give away the ending, but I'll just mention that Coach is involved, and I like it.
*/*****
-Eddie Guerrero vs Chris Benoit vs Rhyno vs Tajiri
For the United States Championship. Four guys all with different backgrounds will make for an exciting match. You never know what you will get out of Guerrero and Tajiri, put that in with the technicality of Benoit and the toughness of Rhyno, and you have an excellent match.
****/*****
-Kurt Angle (c) vs Brock Lesnar
For the WWE Championship. Angle can electrify any audience and I believe he is the best all around wrestler. He shows his perfect combination of speed, power, and technique. Lesnar, on the other hand, doesn't impress me a bit. If it weren't for Angle, this match would be a dud.
***/*****
-RVD vs Kane
Former tag team partners going at it. Nobody can do it like Rob Van Dam and then there is the giant Kane. Kane character started going in a different direction around this time, and it seemed like he was a little more determined to put on a better match.
***/*****
-HHH (c) vs Randy Orton vs Jericho vs Goldberg vs HBK vs Kevin Nash
For the World Heavyweight Championship. First, I just want to say that this match was very hyped, but it didn't live up to it. Looking at this match, you have the man, HBK, a young stud, Orton, Goldberg, Jericho, and HHH. That alone should be a good match. Nash didn't have a role in this match at all. HHH gets hit one time and he literally (I kid you not) lays there for 10 minutes, doing nothing. Bad match.

I'll get started by saying that most of these matches weren't
bad, but - until the Chamber Match (I turned it off)
1st - No Matt Hardy vs. Zach Gowan (he was badly injured)
(just something Matt Hardy can use against the kid -)
Fatal Four-Way U.S Championship - Fun, and Awesome! = 4 stars
Eddie Guerrero vs. Chris Benoit vs. Rhyno vs. Tajiri
(This was great because no one was on the same page, and
their were no alliances between Benoit/Rhyno or Eddie/Tajiri)
(Lots of great back n forth action, cool maneuvers and
tight quickness, just didn't want this one to end)*
- WAS A GREAT OPENER
World Tag-Team Championship = 3 stars
Dudley Boyz vs. La Resistance
(The Dudleyz totally should have won this, why can they not
block that stupid double move they use, it's so counterable)
No Disqualification Match = 1 star (at the least)
Shane vs. Bischoff
(Nothing really made this No Disqualification)
(And this so-called match, wasn't anything)
Undertaker vs. A-Train = 3 stars
(Great match, just like Taker vs. Cena at Vengeance)
(The Taker is just so amazing, especially with his back
against the wall, and forced to fend him off with an injury)
No-Holds Barred Match = 2 stars (not much GOOD, action)
Rob Van Dam vs. Kane
(Even with the stipulation, nothing really made a difference)
(Some ladder use, and a chair and the steel steps - that's all)
(Kind of a pre-empt to the big match at Unforgiven)
WWE Championship = 3.5 stars (not better than Wrestlemania)
Brock Lesnar vs. Kurt Angle
(With a twisted side to him, Brock's a muscle nutcase)
(Kurt never gave up hope, and finally made Brock - TAP)
(Great action though, kind of similar to Wrestlemania!)
AND NOW ON TO THE FAIRLY WORTHLESS - CHAMBER MATCH
Jericho vs. Triple H vs. Goldberg vs. Michaels vs. Nash vs. Orton
-Let me explain some key points!
-This was nothing, I repeat nothing like Survivor Series?
-Eliminations were almost all by Goldberg?
-Everyone was gone way too freaking quickly, and was short)
-Triple H cowering inside the secondary chamber - wussy!
-Nash is nothing special, neither was Michaels in this thing
-And I still can't believe Orton didn't even attempt to win
 the damn title (Triple H has a sick noose on these guys)
-Plus Goldberg was totally floored after this ended, beaten
 and totally bloodied, will someone arrest HHH for battery???

The Undertaker vs A-Train
The Deadman trys to settle the score with the massive A-Train, two big men battle it out in this one.
Street Fight Shane McMahon vs Eric Bischoff
Incredible match with tables, high flying moves, announcers and GM's all involved. This one was certainly a ""Slobberknocker"" to say the least.

Watch as former friends try and take each other out to get the United States Championship.

This event was not near as good as the SummerSlams in the past but still a good showing on PPV, due in part mainly to the Smackdown matches on the card. The DVD comes with little in the way of extras which is a surprising turn-around from their usual jam packed DVDS.
WWE World Tag Team Titles La Resistance (c) vs Dudley Boyz
A really OK match with a predictable ending. Not the dynamite opening a top-notch PPV should have.
Undertaker vs A-train
Pretty good match considering who was in it. Basic match but caters to Undertaker's more slow paced, story-driven match style.
Rob Van Dam vs Kane
Not as good as it should have been given all the buildup and it being Kane's first PPV match after unmasking but still a passable match.
WWE US Title
Eddie Guerrero (c) vs Tajiri vs Rhyno vs Chris Benoit
Solid four way match. Hard to find a match that involves both Guerrero & Benoit that isn't solid.
Shane McMahon vs Eric Bischoff
Crowd interest helped this match as they were into it. Very surprising twist in this match that was shocking but actually kinda funny as well.
WWE Title
Kurt Angle (c) vs Brock Lesnar
GREAT match. Definite Match Of The Year canidate and the match that made this PPV. Angle has become the best overall wrestler of the post-attitude era and Brock may well challenge him for that title in years to come. Surprise ending but it worked well.

Elimination Chamber
Triple H (c) vs Goldberg vs Chris Jericho vs Shawn Michaels vs Randy Orton vs Kevin Nash
The Elimination Chamber match was fun to watch but in the end it was not the greatest way to end the PPV. The crowd was solidly behind Goldberg though. The ending makes sense in the long run but still should have not go on last.

1891716,1,B00009W0UE,"World Wrestling Entertainment must be trying to cut corners with their fanbase.  While they are still pumping in efforts on non-PPV releases, they've stopped placing extra features on the PPV DVD.
When you buy a pay-per-view on DVD, it has been like a scrapbook for the month in which the show occured.  Some would go so far as to include a related match from a Raw or Smackdown! program on the disc.  WrestleMania went even further, and therefore, their discs were always the best value.  Some mediocre pay-per-views were loaded with so many extra features that it made the DVD worth purchasing.
But if Vengeance and now SummerSlam are any indication, then the ""keepsake"" value of these DVD's is no longer an interest to WWE.  Hopefully, the fans/buyers will think twice about owning them until WWE puts more effort into these releases.",1064880000,5,837,4.866197183098592

Lilian Garcia gives a great rendition of the national anthem before the PPV begins (her best performance aside from the Smackdown after 9/11). All of the matches were solid. Lesnar/Angle stole the show in my opinion. My only problem with this DVD is the lack of extras. I have bought dozens of WWE PPV's on DVD, and all of them have had some kind of extras except for the last two to come out on DVD (Vengeance and Summerslam).

1.  Dudleys vs L.A. Resistance
  The key element in this match was Rob Conway(the american traitor).  He was dressed as a camera man and ended up whacking the dudleys with the camera to help the frenchman prevail.  Nothing special happens in this one.  Rating *
2.  Undertaker vs A-Train
  They have had way better matches on Smackdown.  WWE tries to give A-Train another push and once again it backfired.  Taker couldn't get the tombstone or last ride, but as the express goes third time's a charm as he chokeslamed A-train to pick up the victory.  THe only exciting part of the match was the fight between Stephanie and Sable who was in A-train's corner for the match.  Rating *
3.  Shane McMahon vs Eric Bischoff
  The match-up wasn't great but it was very entertaining to say the least.  Shane destroyes bischoff for the first 5 minutes or so until COACH cheapshots Shane with a steel chair.  Coach holds up Shane as bischoff lays into him with his karate kicks until Austin comes down and beats the crap out of Coach and Stuns Bischoff.  Then from a flashback of summerslam 1999 Shane drives an elbow from the top rope unto Bischoff thru the spanish announcer table.  Shane wins.  Rating **
4.  Eddy Guerrero vs Tajiri vs Benoit vs Rhyno
  This was a fatal four way for the US title.  Although, Guerrero is the bad guy, he receives the crowd support for this one.  This was a fast paced match that could've went in anyone's favor.  Guerrero tried to distance from everyone at the beginning since everyone wanted revenge for his actions on them at the previous smackdown.  Despite all the odds, Guerrero hit the frog splash on Rhyno and retained the title.  Rating ***
5.  RVD vs Kane
  Kane's first ppv has this new recent vile monster he has become since July.  He and RVD took each other to the limit on this one.  They used chairs, ladders, and at the end kane hit the tombstone on RVD on the steel steps which helped him get the victory.  Rating  ***
6.  Brock Lesnar vs Kurt Angle
  Lesnar had just turn heel a few weeks before this match.  This was the sequel to their awesome encounter at WrestleMania.  Angle just like wrestlemania walked in the match as champion and Lesnar was desperate in trying to get the belt back and had Mr. McMahon in his side.  Lesnar for the first time in my memory actually tapped out to the ankle lock and get revenge on Mr. McMahon by taking a steel chair, setting it up and deliver an angle slam on McMahon unto the steel chair.  OUCH!  Not a good birthday gift for the boss.  Rating ***1/2
7.  Elimnation chamber
  Nash, Orton, HHH, HBK, Y2J, and Goldberg were the participants for this one.  This match was in my opinion a major let-down from the first one.  HHH didn't hardly ever get in the match.  He spent most of the time hiding from Goldberg as he elimnated 3 guys in 5 minutes (hbk, y2j, and orton).  Finally, he and goldberg were the last two guys left.  Flair got involved here as he to prevent goldberg from getting thru the HHH's door and attacking him and at the end hand HHH his sledgehammer as Goldberg was going for the spear.  HHH hit him as he went for it and remained champ.  Evolution attacks Goldberg after the match.

1891720,4,B00009W0UE,"Well this would have been probably the best ss in history but of course the WWE ruined it by making two crucial mistakes. First of all they had an oppurtunity of a lifetime to get Austin back in the ring for one more match against Kane, the whole Kane unmasking storyline has to do with Austin turning Kane back into a monster but what do they do? Put Kane against RVD, now normally that would be a good match but when you have an oppurtunity for a big match like Austin vs. Kane you should take it. The second crucial mistake they made was to change the much-anticipated one on one match between Goldberg & HHH to an elimination chamber match, and once that seemed like a good idea and turned out to be a great match they ruin it by letting hhh win for about the 1,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000th. time in a row in a ppv main event, but other than those mistakes I would have to say this was one hell of a show and a good way to finish off the summer.

1) Dudley Boyz vs. La Resistance
**- I'll admit the Dudleys know how to get a crowd going and it's good to do that in your opening match, but not against La Resistance please!  Match was typical Dudley match with all their signature moves done, but Rob Conway smacks Dvon with a camera so La Resistance keeps the belts.  Don't know why they're still champs, they can't even really wrestle.  Oh well.
2) Undertaker vs. A-Train
**1/2- I don't think anyone expected this match to be match of the night, but I can't diss them completely.  They both tried their best but what more can you do with a 41-year-old man and a hairy teddy bear?  UT wins with his usual ""come back from an injury and win with the chokeslam"" routine.  Aftermanth with Steph/Sable didn't click with me, but I'm curious as to where Taker and Steph are heading now.  Hmmmmm...
3) Shane McMahon vs. Eric Bischoff
***1/2- Not a wrestling match at all, but it definitely was entertaining.  I didn't expect Coach at all to be Bischoff's backup plan and Coach played his new heel role brilliantly.  Austin comes to save the day, ShaneOMac does his patented elbow into the announce table for the win.  As stated, no wrestling, just cool entertainment.
4) Eddie Guerrero vs. Chris Benoit vs. Rhyno vs. Tajiri
(US Title Match)
****1/2- Oh God, what is wrong with Vince that he can't give awesome technical athletes like these four another 10 minutes to wrestle and yet gives slow-moving wrestlers like HHH all the time in the world?!?  That takes a half-star away from this match, but other than that, very good contest.  Loved the double submission midway through and it seemed either four of them had a chance to win the US title.  I was glad Eddie won nevertheless, he's hot right now and needs a good run with that belt.  Maybe they'll finally get Benoit back in the main event.
5) Kurt Angle vs. Brock Lesnar (WWE Championship)
*****- Please keep this feud going, I don't care what type of matches you give these two (iron man match anybody?), they just have such awesome chemistry in the ring.  I like Lesnar's new heel role and it mixed well with Angle's inspirational comeback here in this Wrestlemania rematch.  Was a little slow at times, but they kicked it into 3rd gear 15 minutes into the match.  Angle dragging Lesnar from the ropes over and over with the anklelock was a neat way to finish the match.  Loved every minute of it!
6) Rob Van Dam vs. Kane
**1/2- OK match, nothing special, although it's nice to see the Kane of '97 back.  Funny how he fell off the top rope, bravo big guy!  RVD used his usual tactics, missed the van terminator, and got tombstoned on the steel steps.  Decent showing and Kane needed the win obviously to move on to Shane/Kane.
7) Elimination Chamber match for World Title
HHH vs. Goldberg vs. Randy Orton vs. HBK vs. Kevin Nash vs. Chris Jericho
***1/2- No way near as good as the first one, and this one was 20 minutes shorter than that one last year, but good enough to promote the HHH/Goldberg match at Unforgiven.  Good thought to start off with HBK/Y2J and they booked this match good, having HHH and Goldberg come out last considering Goldberg is still not used to the WWE style and HHH wrestled with a torn groin.  I'll admit this, and you'll know it from my Backlash 2003 review if you read that, I'm not Goldberg's biggest fan, I think he has limited skills and little long-term growth, but he was impressive in the chamber.  Spearing and jackhammering the heck out of Orton and HBK and then spearing Y2J through the glass was great to look at and HHH looked scared to death of him.  But the ending killed it, having HHH sledgehammer Goldberg to win.  That literally was HHH's only offensive move in this match.  I don't know what WWE is thinking is keeping this belt on him for so long, HHH is hurting too much, he's slower now than he was before he tore his quad, and his character's going stale.  Plenty of great entertainers like Jericho and Booker T there on Raw and they keep it on him.
OVERALL: Now that I'm done with my rant, Summerslam 2003 was good for what it gave us.  Like I said earlier, definitely cannot compete with last year's when you had Mysterio/Angle, RVD/Benoit, HBK/HHH, and Rock/Brock.  But if anything, the Chamber match, Angle/Lesnar II, and the US title match should be enough for you to get this DVD.  I give SS2003 a 3 1/2 out of 5.",1062028800,,4549,4.4896719319562575

Dudley Boys vs. La Resistance- World Tag Title- 3/5
  This match had tthe DUdleys kicking butt until that cameraman's screwjob on the Dudley's costing them the title and La Resistance retains yet again.
Undertaker vs. A-Train w/Sable- 4.5/5
  Taker and Train showed a great match with a lot of finishers that had Taker win in the end. It was funny at the end of this match when Stephanie came up and beat the hell out of Sable.
Eric Bishcoff vs. Shane McMahon- No DQ/ Falls Count Anywhere- 3.75/5
  I Feel bad for the Spanish announcers, it seems that at every PPV, Someone goes through their Table. Well it was Eric this time in a match that was only funny but a good match as well and the bits with the Coach and Austin was good too.
Eddie vs. Tajiri vs. Ryno vs. Chris Benoit- US Title- Fatal Fourway- 4/5
  Well I thought that this math would steal the show. Well it didn't live up to its expectations, but it was still a short but sweet match. I loved it whenthey had 2 submissions going on at the same time. A lot of finishers but a little short.
Kurt Angle vs. Brock Lesnar- WWE Title- 5/5
  This match stole the show. It was the longest match (22 mins) and had me on my seat the whole time. It ended with an almost 1 minute ankle lock that had Lesnar submit. And after the match Angle put Vince through a chair.
Kane vs. RVD- No Holds Barred- 5/5
  Chairs, ladders, steps, and the fan barricade were all used in this great match. Definately this show's dark horse. RVD's high-flying manuevers and Kane's Power along with the weapons made this match amazing.
Randy Orton vs. Kevin Nash vs. HHH vs. Goldberg vs. Y2J vs. HBK- World Heavyweight Tile- Elimination Chamber- 5/5
  First things first- It was cool to see HBK and Jericho start this match off, then came Orton, Nash, HHH (not really), then Micheals gave his buddy Nash some sweet Chin Music and eliminate him, then came GOLDBERG! He eliminated Orton, then speared Y2J through the plexiglass to eliminate him, the eliminated HBK. Trips was then still in his chamber with Flair making sure the door didn't open. Then Goldberg barged through the glass and strted to beat up HHH and then Flair slipped HHH a sledge Hammer and gave it to Goldberg, Goldberg was eliminated, and then got beat almost to death by evolution. This match was great but had a bad ending and was not as great as the first EC match.
Well get this DVD- this event was almost as good as WMXIX, the best non WM in the past 2 years. Definiatly get it.",1061856000,,2717,4.354455445544555

7993360,3,B00009W0UE,"SummerSlam is often called the second biggest show the WWE puts on during the year; however, in 2003, the biggest show of the summer seemed to be an afterthought between the attempts to make the brand exclusive events relevant. Despite that, SummerSlam still had a stacked double main event featuring the promotion's hottest feud and the return of one of their most infamous matches.

Looking at the result, it can be argued that the event is a tale of two halves: the RAW half, and the SmackDown half. The RAW half consisted of mostly mediocre matches and head-scratching booking decisions. Such events as The Coach turning heel on Shane McMahon and Triple H defeating Goldberg in the Elimination Chamber still don't seem to make much sense. The only RAW match that delivered was the Elimination Chamber that was hindered by that booking gaff.

The other half, provided by the blue brand, is much better. First, A-Train and the Undertaker had a solid, if unspectacular big man match, and then a strong Fatal Four-Way for the US Title followed it up nicely. The WWE Title Match between Kurt Angle and Brock Lesnar capped of the SmackDown portion with a great match that surpassed their WrestleMania match and was a match of the year candidate.

While their are some worthwhile matches on the card, I would say that only one is really memorable... But it's a Heck of a match! Outside of Angle/Benoit from the Rumble and maybe HBK/Jericho from 'Mania, I don't think anything measures up to it from 2003. Even so, the unfulfilling main event and lackluster supporting matches make this event a pretty weak SummerSlam overall.",1410220800,,1622,4.8483754512635375

  WORLD TAG TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH: LA RESISTANCE VS. THE DUDLEY BOYZ
  This match was overall pretty good. There was plenty of action and not really any slow spots. Both teams fought it out hard. Perfect for an opener. The ending was a let down and obviously not well thought out for the second biggest ppv of the year. 7/10

 UNDERTAKER VS. A-TRAIN
 I enjoyed this match but I wish they would have added a little bit more from a-train. It was better than his wrestlemania match though. There some cool spots and at the end Stephanie McMahon beats up Sable. Undertaker saved the match and made it worth seeing. 6 3/4/ 10

 SHANE MCMAHON VS. ERIC BISCHOFF
 Stone Cold saved the match. There was hardly any NO DQ action. KANE VS. SHANE would have better with their last man standing match 1 ppv away. The Coach and Eric Bischoff suck at wrestling, especialy with someone as talented as Shane. 4/10

 ZACH GOWEN VS. MATT HARDY
 WASTE OF TIME!!! It isn't a match because Zach can't wrestle due to injury. Matt trys to take the credit. Really dissapointing with guys like Christian, Booker T, Big Show, and Edge not on the card. 0/10

 FATAL FOUR-WAY MATCH FOR THE U.S. CHAMPIONSHIP: EDDIE GUERRERO VS. CHRIS BENOIT VS. RHYNO VS. TAJIRI
 AWSOME MATCH. Action everywhere! This is one of the best matches one the card. Tajiri gives some awsome kicks, Rhyno beats everyone in sight, Eddie lies, cheats, and steals his way to victory. The only bad thing is sucky Benoit. 9/10

 WWE CHAMPIONSHIP MATCH: KURT ANGLE VS. BROCK LESNAR
 Pretty good match. Both competiters gave it all and it payed of. This match is full of action and a lot of owwws and auughs. The only bad thing is McMahon's involvement at the end and a few slow spots. 8 1/2/10

 ROB VAN DAM VS. KANE
BEST MATCH OF THE NIGHT!!!!!!!!!! Full of high flying moves, weapon shots, an people getting beat up. 10/10

 ELIMINATION CHAMBER MATCH FOR THE WORLD HEAVEYWEIGHT TITEL: TRIPLE H VS. SHAWN MICHAELS VS. CHRIS JERICHO VS. RANDY ORTON VS. KEVIN NASH VS. GOLDBERG
  Pretty good match. A lot of action and suspense. It wasn't as good as the last one though. There was to much Goldberg not enough everyone else. Goldberg made every one else look bad and took them all out to fast. Kevin Nash was out way to early. The ending was let down. It was still good though. 7/10",1198108800,,2393,4.519813519813519
7993362,4,B00009W0UE,"Summerslam 2003 didn't really deliver the goods on the Raw side. Smackdown wrestlers stole the show with great action.

The Dudleys VS La Resistance: Never really liked the feud between these two teams. Nothing you wouldnt see on Raw.

Undertaker VS A-Train: I always enjoy matches with two big guys going at it. A power match.

Shane McMahon VS Eric Bishoff: A good story going in this match. Shane always gives his best efforts but this wasn't one of his better brawls.

Eddie Guerrero VS Chris Beniot VS Rhyno VS Tajiri: Before UPN folded, Smackdown put on the best shows around. They had the best wrestlers and some awesome matches. This is no different.

Kurt Angle VS Brock Lesner: Very good match. Once again showing that in 2002 and 2003- Smackdown was the better show.

Kane VS RVD: A no dqs match with RVD. Couldnt go wrong or could it? Well Kane had the act going of he cant be hurt or stopped at the time. Nothing really speical.

HHH VS Randy Orton VS Shawn Michales VS Kevin Nash VS Goldberg VS Y2J in an Elimination Chamber: Dont get me wrong, Raw had the talent as well. Raw was sort of WCW with proven veterans but Triple H ruined it all. A good match but of course, Ric Flairs helps Triple H retain the gold. I hated Goldberg in WCW but loved it when he dethroned Triple H for the title. A good match but ended sucked.

Overall Smackdown has the better matches. Raw didn't put on a good effort and anther finish with Triple H cheating hurt the main event.",1196467200,,1473,4.409594095940959
7993363,3,B00009W0UE,"The Summerslam of 2003 featured the second Elimination Chamber match.  Oddly enough, it is a forgettable event.  Was strong on the night it took place, but probably won't age very well.

World Tag Titles
Dudley Boyz vs. La Resistance:
Wow, how annoying can one tag team really be?  We feel like we've seen this match thousands of times (probably because we have).  The match is a decent choice for an opener.  It has a watchable pace and a good flow, but as usual is spoiled by a cruddy ending.  It's worth a look.

Undertaker vs. A-Train w/ Sable:
I actually don't mind A-Train's style.  Sable, who for some reason is featured on the cover of the DVD, excorts him to the ring.  Each of these matches are buildup to Taker and McMahon's buried alive match at Survivor Series 2003.  The match, surprisingly, has a nice chemistry and a good speed for two big guys.  We also get to see a mini cat fight at the end between Sable and Steph, which spices this one up a bit.

No DQ Match
Shane McMahon vs. Eric Bischoff:
Really?--This match is just as bad as it looks.  I don't always mind fun little matches that add something different to the event, but this one is ugly, folks.  It's a weird storyline/feud to begin with, and the quality of the match does nothing to help that.  It also drags on a little too long; and gets a sort of insulting reaction from the crowd. This year's PPVs gave us a lot of these type matches though- this might be the worst one of all though.

United States Title
Eddie Guerrero vs. Chris Beniot vs. Tajiri vs. Rhyno:
Yes!  That's one way to sum this one up.  There's plenty of technicality to go around, and then some.  Each of the styles clash well. Eddie had a personal issue with each of the other competitors in the match.  There are a lot of high points in the match, including simulataneous submission holds and some sick spills and suplexes.  The ending brings this down just a wee bit.  If it weren't for the WWE title match, this would definitely be the best on the card.  Watch and enjoy.

WWE Title
Kurt Angle vs. Brock Lesnar:
This is the match I just mentioned.  In most cases, this is overlooked because of the Elimination Chamber.  Any true wreslting fan can appreciate this on any level.  This has everything you might expect, as well as an abundance of crowd appreciation.  As many times as we've seen these two in PPV matches, it never seems to get old.  The match unforunately follows that pattern of the evening, cheap endings.  McMahon's interference brings this down slightly, but nonetheless should have been the main event!

No DQ Match
Kane vs. Rob Van Dam:
No disqualification match #2 of the evening pits the recently unmasked Kane against his former tag team partner Rob Van Dam.  I won't bring it down to the level of the Shane/Bischoff match, but it needed a lot of work.  It's mostly a one-sided slug fest with Kane punching RVD down, with Van Dam getting in some shots here and there.  It's a bully match, so RVD rarely gets an opportunity to show us his unorthodox style- not to mention a few obvious botches throughout.  Kane was still scary at this point, so that keeps this one afloat..I suppose.

World Heavyweight Title
Elimination Chamber
Triple H vs. Goldberg vs. Randy Orton vs. Chris Jericho vs. Shawn Michaels vs. Kevin Nash:
This one had a lot to live up to from the previous year's amazing chamber match.  Unfortunately, it falls pretty short.  The ending is kind of predictable, and again, a little cheap.  The eliminations happen all too fast when Goldberg gets released from his pod, which is a low point in this one.  It, however, is not as bad as it sounds.  It's a strong match, with quite a bit of brutality- but is ultimately a little mundane and underwhelming.  I will say that it is better than some of the chamber matches we get nowadays.  Overall, I was satisfied.

Summerslam '03 overall is kind of a mixed bag.  It has some excellent encounters, some so-so ones, and one bad one.  The main events are strong, so I'll recommend this one for a reasonable price.",1184630400,,4044,4.51448275862069

Dudley Boyz Vs. La Resistance - This was a good opener from a fans point of view. The crowd was very into this match which made the match more then what it was. The match itself was average and it was a nice way to start the show. But the match itself was only here to put over a storyline with the match ending after a phony camera man helped La Resistance to retain the Tag Team Titles and to set up the Tables Match next month at Unforgiven. 3/5

Undertaker Vs. A-Train - A-Train is only average at best as a performer but Undertaker helped A-Train out here to deliver a pretty good match. Undertaker's ribs were frequently targeted throughout the match and A-train did a good job making UT's ribs the focus point of the match. Decent match with Undertaker winning with the chokeslam. After the match, Stephanie McMahon returned to have a catfight with Sable. 3.5/5

Shane McMahon Vs. Eric Bischoff - I will say this about this match, Shane knows how to put on an entertainig match at a SummerSlam event. But the bottom line is that this match wasn't anything special. Shane took it Bischoff in the early going until Johnathon Coachman interfered and Bischoff made the match No DQ and Falls Count Anywhere. The match went 2 on 1 for a little while until Stone Cold came out and stunned everybody. The match ends after Shane hits the elbow drop to Bischoff through the announce table. Entertaining match but nothing special. 3/5

Fatal Four Way for the United States Championship
Eddie Guerrero Vs. Rhyno Vs. Chris Benoit Vs. Tajiri - This is the first match of the night that delivered. All four athletes gave everything they could and they delivered a fantastic match. Benoit, Rhyno, Tajiri all put on a strong performance with Eddie adding comedy value to the match with his ""Lyin, Cheatin, & Stealin'"" antics to win the match. Great match. 4.5/5

WWE Championship
Kurt Angle Vs. Brock Lesnar - By far this is the best match of the night. Other reviewers point out that this match topped their WrestleMania match but I disagree with that 100%. Angle and Lesnar deliver a strong performance and they produced a great WWE Title match but I just don't feel this match even touched their match from WrestleMania. The psychology of this match is totally different from the match Lesnar and Angle put on at WrestleMania but that doesn't take away the effort and the strong performance both men put on. Lesnar was heavily putting over his heel turn with Kurt not giving up to Lesnar one bit. The ending was great with the sequence of finshers and counters until Lesnar tapped out to the Ankle Lock. This was indeed a great WWE Title Match nevertheless. 5/5

No Holds Barred
Kane Vs. Rob Van Dam - This match only had one purpose to it and that was to display the insanity and monstrious power Kane now has ever since his unmasking. Quite frankly, Kane dominated RVD for the better portion of this match with RVD giving all his might to overcome the monster. Kane and RVD did a good job using various weapons introduced to the match such as a steel chair, steel steps, and a ladder against one another. In the end, it was Kane countering the Van-Terminator and Tombstoning RVD onto the steel steps for the win. This was a very good match to put over Kane's new ""monster"" side. 4/5

Elimination Chamber Match for the World Heavyweight Championship
Triple H Vs. Goldberg Vs. Chris Jericho Vs. Shawn Michaels Vs. Kevin Nash Vs. Randy Orton - This was a BIG stepdown from the previous Chamber Match at the Survivor Series. HHH was injured here so he was limited at his performance in the match. Also the HHH/Orton Evolution deal wasn't really a big factor in the match. Nobody really has a good showing, other then Goldberg who nearly ran over everybody after his arrival to the match. The highlight of the match for me was when Goldberg speared Jericho through the glass chamber. Surprised that didn't break Chris Jericho's back. After Goldberg eliminated half of the people in the match, HHH steals the win after hitting Goldberg with the sledgehammer. The post-match beatdown from Evolution set up the Goldberg/HHH match which occurred a month later at Unforgiven. 4/5

This SummerSlam was a HUGE step below from it's previous year. No match really sticks out other then the Angle/Lesnar WWE Title Match and the Fatal Four Way U.S. Title Match. If you can find this somewhere cheap, I recommend it but other then that you can pass or give this a rental.",1171411200,,4477,4.64520202020202

Shane McMahon beats the crap out of Bischoff for the entire first half of the match. It is fairly entertaining. Then, Bischoff's back-up plan shows up. The match becomes more of a segment after that.

I hate a lot of this match. Chris Jericho and Shawn Michaels start it off. They do some technical wrestling that the crowd does not seem to care about at all. The crowd only cares about Goldberg. The match does not really pick up until Kevin Nash comes in and uses the Chamber on his opponents. Nash is eliminated quickly though and the match is boring again. Not until Goldberg enters the match does it get really entertaining. I'm not even a Goldberg fan, but he made the match past horrible.
