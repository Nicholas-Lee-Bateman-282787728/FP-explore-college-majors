8659748,5,B00KLJW1FC,I had seen this movie years ago with another actor. It such a fun movie and loved the little boy who later starred in second hand lion. This kid is amazing! However after watching it again I would certainly recommend a pre screen if you plan to let children watch this. Depending on your kids they could become more creative with some new  ideas about doing things you would not wish them to even consider.,1528588800,,406,4.413333333333333

8659751,2,B00KLJW1FC,I was hoping for the version of the movie that was made in the 1950s. This version is so corny; it isn't even funny. I wouldn't recommend purchasing this.,1474934400,,154,4.344827586206897
8659752,4,B00KLJW1FC,I bought this for The Ransom of Red Chief as part of a literature unit in the classroom. The film is cute and strays from the original text quite a bit. That is always fine as it allows for a discussion on text choices.,1466553600,,219,4.0
8659753,5,B00KLJW1FC,"Adorable. The storyline is familiar to all who have read the books. An obnoxious child makes fools of some kidnappers. But in this story, we get to know the chld and his parents and although they have good intentions they need the kidnappers to show them where could improve as parents. Delightful rendition.",1461888000,,308,4.830188679245283
