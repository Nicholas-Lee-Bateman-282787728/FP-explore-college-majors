There seems to be misunderstandings about alternative healing such as Reiki.  This DVD works great.  I show 3/4 of the film to my informative talks.  At times, the speaker keeps giving examples of energy, when there was no need to keep going on.  Other then that I feel this is really good tool.",1464393600,,417,4.35064935064935

7972642,5,B00006RHSZ,"I teach reiki all levels and this Reiki DVD by Ian Welsh is great he is  a real Reiki Master. One can tell that he has a deep commitment to reiki. I use  5-15 minutes of this DVD in my Reiki Classes I show different sections in each class .
I am very grateful that he did not include any process that should be learned in a  in person reiki class. I find it very helpful. So glad he did not include history of Reiki .As information keeps getting 'found' it would be not be updated. My students also tell me they get alot out it .

7972643,5,B00006RHSZ,"Having been attuned to Reiki I and II many years ago and finally preparing to become a Reiki Master, I ordered this DVD to get Mr. Welch's perspective and perhaps have a more visual tool to help prepare for classes. I am not disappointed. His clear explanations, positive viewpoints and obvious deep respect for this healing modality exhude throughout the film. Many scenes to enjoy.",1168905600,3,383,4.907692307692308
7972644,5,B00006RHSZ,"This is an introduction to reiki which is geared towards those who are not familiar with reiki at all, or who have heard of it but do not know what it is.  Ian Welch is an entertaining presenter and a reputable Reiki Master-Teacher, and this DVD is a good way to learn about reiki.  It doesn't dumb it down though, so if you ARE familiar with reiki, you can still watch it and not feel like it's all beneath you.  In fact it was nice to see an actual attunement as it's being done.  I'm a level two already, so this DVD was something I bought more to have for my collection, but it actually is helpful for me to see someone else doing attunements, as I am going to be a Master-Teacher myself and I enjoyed seeing a class in progress.

If you are interested in reiki, I definitely recommend this DVD!",1132963200,8,799,4.196078431372549
