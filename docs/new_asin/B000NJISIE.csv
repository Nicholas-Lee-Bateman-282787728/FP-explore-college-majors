8178358,5,B000NJISIE,"this is the final disc of the Princess Princess series. I wasn't sure what to expect when I came across the first volume of the manga, but I bought it and I couldn't stop laughing. I promptly bought the rest of the series (including the Princess Princess + sequel that was released) and decided to buy the anime when it came out. It's one thing to read, but it's entirely different to be able to watch the characters expression and body language in an anime. I find that I can relate to the characters more in anime than I can in the manga, but I love them both the same. The characters are feeling the same way that I am, so it's great when I want comedy and to be able to relate to someone as well.",1361318400,,700,4.116788321167883
8178359,3,B000NJISIE,I love this series so much when I watched it online that I had to buy it.  Unfortunately this set of dvds was so bleached out.  It seemed like it was just so off.  I could hardly stand to watch it.  Adjusting the settings on my television and trying it on a different one didn't help either.  This was highly disappointing.  I give the series an A+ but this dvd a F.,1219708800,,366,4.013888888888889
