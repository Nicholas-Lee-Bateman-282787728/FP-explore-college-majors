8473145,1,B005HIXF20,I can't believe George Harrison was involved with this flick. What a let down.,1459123200,,78,4.642857142857143
8473146,4,B005HIXF20,"First of all, if you're an American, be careful with this one for many reasons.  Its PAL, which means you need a region free player.  If you happen to have one of those, you're probably going to be OK with the British-ness of this too, which is a second caution.  The Anglicisms and the class significance of this film might make it a slog for your average American, but that being said, it is a good film and its obscure status on this side of the pond seems to be unjustified.  John Hurt is outstanding, and surprise, after being a Beatles fan and collecting nearly everything, I heard some incidental music that surely was by George Harrison which I'd never heard before.",1440806400,,674,4.5
