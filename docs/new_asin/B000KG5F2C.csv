I took notes the second time and I am sharing the notes and DVD with my friends who have shared their problems with time management, too. It is so valuable, that I am surprised it sells at such a low price! I am truly inspired and challanged by Mr. Tracy! I am applying what he teaches and it really works!",1357344000,,379,3.935064935064935

Brian covers 4 sections:
1) Time and Personal Empowerment
2) Personal Strategic Planning
3) Setting Your Priorities
4) Balancing Work and Family

All in all, he gave me tons of great ideas on how to better manage my time - ie. my life.

I would absolutely recommend this seminar to anyone wanting some good practical strategies to get in control of their time. Great product! Thanks!",1263168000,4,623,4.6454545454545455

8156298,5,B000KG5F2C,"Brian Tracy's training in this DVD is the single most important productivity-boosting resource I've ever used.  It's helped transform me to even higher levels of success and results by showing specific strategies that work to leverage time and personal production more successfully.

You can google me and find dozens of sites I've created over the years -- much of the significant boost in productivity I've achieved is directly attributable to what I've learned from Brian in this DVD, and I highly recommend it.  Thank you, Brian!

This is perfect for:

+ Managers and business leaders who want to coach their employees for higher personal productivity and better work ethics/achievement

+ Entrepreneurs and small business owners who want to start leveraging their limited time more effectively and produce more, faster -- to boost sales.

+ Anybody who wants to accomplish *more* in their lives.

As always, Brian Tracy provides world-class leadership, and this is a comprehensive DVD that's a must-get for anyone who's serious about success.  One of my top favorite business DVDs ever... get it now!

8156299,5,B000KG5F2C,"I loved it! This DVD is the best Brian Tracy seminar out there, because of the high quality recording and topics he talks about.  It's recorded in front of a live audience, so you know nothing is fake, and really feel like you're there in the crowd, seeing him live.  You can feel the awesome energy and enthusiasm Brian Tracy has when he interacts with the crowd.  He's an incredibly talented speaker, and made so many great points that I had to stop the DVD to take more notes!

He's right - Productivity is one of the biggest things that can either hold us back or put us ahead of the rest ... Watching this DVD is absolutely worth the time and I'm so glad I have it.  I re-watch it, and it was great to get more and more out of it each time.",1194480000,3,745,4.110344827586207
