So every Sunday night, from the 3rd or 4th row, my 16 year old self got to see the most voluptuous woman in America. Good...no, GREAT times.
  Before she got a bit carried away with facial plastic surgery work (why??), she was a classic beauty-with a body to kill for. And, lest I forget, turns out she has a great mind for the business. So all hail Missy Hyatt, the one and ONLY first lady of pro rasslin'.",1321142400,,564,4.311320754716981
