The stars are the planes, though the storyline is not bad. the footage of the prewar (USA) planes is top shelf. Turner or AMC run this every now and then stay home from work to see it. Released less then four months before the attack on Pearl Harbor it studies avi/med. Why no US DVD hey I'll buy two, OK three OK,OK five (widecreen) and a little sound work on the engines but didn't touch the color. This flim is to it's time what Tom Hanks did for the Apollo space program in 'From the Earth to the Moon', but not as large is Mr. Hanks' work.

494064,4,6302682614,"A film that functions both as the ""Top Gun"" of its day and as a tribute to the unsung heroes of Aviation medicine, the ""Flight Surgeons"". This film will be greatly enjoyed by those interested in World War II era fighter planes. The brilliant color footage of U.S. Navy planes in action just prior to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor is outstanding and the camera actually takes you into the cockpits with the pilots. Errol Flynn plays a Navy surgeon who performs a risky, and unsuccessful operation on a critically injured pilot and is unfairly blamed by fellow Navy pilots for the man's death. The pilot blacked out at high elevation while performing a training exercise, a fate not uncommon in those days. This event inspires Flynn, a Harvard trained surgeon, to study the effects of altitude on pilots, even using himself as a guinea pig. Of course there is the requisite love interest and ensuing conflict but they're merely fluff. Dive bomber puts you at Pearl Harbor just prior to its destruction. It puts you on the U.S.S. Saratoga, the aircraft carrier that would meet a similar fate early on in the war. From a historical perspective, this film is essential viewing.",1139356800,2,1178,4.779411764705882
494065,4,6302682614,"The story is typical pre second World War let's show off the Navy. The greatness is in the photogrophy. If you want to see what San Diego and Naval Air Station North Island looked like prior to the war, this is your picture. The aerial photography is beautiful, especially a shot of the Hotel Del Coronado circa 1940. When I see this film my thoughts seem to dweal on the Navy people who appear as extras in this film. How many went on to serve and give up their lives in the coming years? We where flying biplanes and Japan and Germany were flying ME 109's and Zero's.
 Errol Flynn looks young, fit, and very much the Naval Officer. The script was written by Frank Wead (Wead's life was the subject of John Ford's Wings of Eagles)and depicts a very macho image of Naval Aviators. These were the Top Guns before there were Top Guns. So see the film for a great looking Flynn, the pre-War Navy at it's best and a slice of a California and America in a much more simple time.

494066,4,6302682614,"DIVE BOMBER is one of the many films of the early forties which glorified the service branches: here we have Technicolor, big-budget treatment - and the full cooperation of the Naval Air Corps.  This movie constantly waivers.  There was an interesting, rather detailed examination of the new techniques in estimating a flyer's fitness, in solving the problems of ""blacking out"" when a pilot pulls out of a power dive, and in overcoming the hazards of stratospheric flying.  Truly breathtaking formation flying, enhanced furthur by smogless Technicolor, was used in abundance.  This dramatic and topical material was contrasted with flat story development in combination with artless ""romantic interest"".  A good deal of the film was photographed at the Naval Air Station in San Diego and in the air amid billowing California clouds.  Additonal material was filmed at Pensacola Naval Air Station and aboard the aircraft carrier ENTERPRISE.",1044316800,14,938,5.390410958904109

Insofar as that's concerned the movie is accurate.  However the other developments; a pressure suit for high altitude flight and a successful pressurized twin engined Lockheed type 10 aircraft were both done at Wright Field in Dayton, OH.  Poppen's ""anti-G belt"" was not very good but was basically on the right track but overtaken by the development of better liquid and later compressed air filled suits ca. 1940.",1037491200,9,561,4.946808510638298
494068,4,6302682614,"Warner Brothers 1941 ""Dive Bomber"" was one of the best aviation films of its day and the credit belongs not so much to director Michael Curtiz as it does to Frank Wead, who wrote the screenplay with Robert Buckner from his original story.  ""Spig"" Wead had been a Commander in the U.S. Navy, credited with starting the Navy's flying program until he was partially crippled in an accident at home.  Wead's story was told in John Ford's 1957 ""The Wings of Eagles"" with John Wayne playing the part.  Errol Flynn stars as Dr. Doug Lee, who decides to devote himself to aviation medicine after an injured pilot dies during surgery.  Working with test pilot Joe Blake (Fred MacMurray), Lee tries to find a solution to what is then called ""Aviation Sickness.""  The best sequences in the film take place in the air, as they should since the film was made with the assistance of the Navy, although some credit needs to be given to the first rate photography as well.  Even the laboratory sequences have a certain sense of drama.  Flynn is his usual dashing self, even though he leaves most of the flying to MacMurray and Ralph Bellamy.  I can never get used to see an angry, bitter MacMurray having first encountered him as Steve Douglas on ""My Three Sons,"" but, of course, the actor made his mark in the film noir classic ""Double Indemnity.""  In the end ""Dive Bomber"" is a solid inspirational film that tells the true story of men who risked their lives to gain new medical knowledge and even the Hollywood elements, such as a young Alexis Smith as Linda Fisher, do not detract from the vivid flying sequences.  Even without an actual war going on, this is an above-average action film for the time right before the United States entered World War II.  This is ""Spig"" Wead's second best script after ""They Were Expendable.""",991785600,4,1814,4.6375

The airplanes and the formation flying over North Island Naval Air Station are a tribute to Naval Aviation, and will  bring back many lost memories. Unfortunately, the serious nature of the  story, high altitude flying problems,  is  overshadowed by the comedic  design of the equipment being flight tested to solve the problem.

Great background shots of San Diego, the Del Coronado Hotel, and North Island Naval Air Station. Some of the plot and dialog is foirmulaic, but consider that the Second World War in Europe was already in its second year. Some of the science and high altitude pressurization concerns were genuine. Errol Flynn was never better, and the supporting cast is sold. Good depiction of the social life and the Night and Officers Clubs in San Diego. A sobering thought; some of the pilots and crews from the squadrons flying the TBDs, Buffalos, and Vindicators off the SARATOGA and the ENTERPRISE in the movie would be lost at Midway a little more than a year later..
The technicolor restoration is very well done; probably only the Wizard of Oz and GWTW were as good. A flag waver but in a good cause; the first
of the ""preparation"" movies and maybe the best.

494175,5,6302682614,"Film might have been better titled ""Flight Surgeon"" since it follows Flynn's character.  A Navy doctor in Honolulu is on hand as the air group from Enterprise flies in with a show for the brass.  The oldest member of a trio that won a trophy for the Navy at the Cleveland air races is about to settle down in Hawaii with his wife that he met in Ohio.  He blacks out in the demonstration, crashes,  and dies on the operating table later from severe spinal cord injury.  His buddies blame the doctor for insisting on an immediate operation.  He is later challenged by the two to put in the hours and become a full fledged flight surgeon.  He decides to do just that and meets up with them again, as they are assigned to San Diego as flight instructors,  After earning his wings grudgingly from them, he decides to stay with the resident researcher and tackle g-force blackouts and altitude sickness.

There are so many planes to be seen here in prewar squadron colors and neutrality gray.  Continuity is sometimes sacrificed in editing.
Most of the footage involves N3N, F2A, F3F, TBD, SB2C, SB2U and what might be a Ryan ST-A Special with a cowled radial engine and fixed gear as a lend lease plane being ferried to England via Canada from the American manufacturer.  You can also spot BT, F11C fixed gear, PBY, PB2Y, SNJ and who knows what else in the background.  Near the end, it is hard to tell if we are seeing the XC-35 painted o.d. overall with black Navy and ""X"" markings, or a Lockheed 10 intended to look like it.",1431561600,2,1522,4.47463768115942

Aerial sequences of landing and taking off of the old USS Enterprise were novel at that time.  This was released just months before Pearl Harbor so it is a bit wistful that many of the Naval personnel extras were going to fight the Japanese over the next 4 years and many would not come back to port.  The Battle of Midway was only a year away and entire divebomber and torpedo bomber squads from the Enterprise, Yorktown, and Hornet were destined to be wiped out.  The testy rivalry between Flynn and MacMurray is great and the snubbing of Alexis Smith is hilarious. The scientific challenges faced by Flynn's character of flight surgeon Dr. Lee and his colleagues were based on contemporary research such as the early G-suit developed at the Mayo Clinic under Dr. Earl Wood (with the help of Col.

I had not seen it before so when it came up around Memorial Day it got DVR'd for later viewing.

According to Wikipedia it was filmed in color (and not colorized later), despite being made in 1941 when a lot of movies were still in black and white.

It tells a somewhat simplistic and not real believable story of a novice flight surgeon played by Flynn and a flight instructor (MacMurray) who team up to solve the medical problems associated with high altitude flight.

I suspect almost nothing in the film reflects anything as it really happened, although, IIRC, some of it may have been very loosed based on some things that did happen.

The aircraft are fun to watch and they sound like aircraft should sound.

Enjoy it and try not to pick on the inconsistencies and the war propaganda that it represented.

I suspect at least some of the aircraft (and their pilots) shown flying so majestically in the film were lost in action not long after the film was released in 1941, as they were just not up to taking on the Japanese Zeros.",1371859200,,1254,4.546666666666667

Seeing the airplanes and pre-WWII San Diego area from the air all in stunning Technicolor is alone worth the price of admission!

I believe several previous reviewers have already said it was the ""Top Gun"" of its day. That is, a weak script used as a device to showcase Navy aviation; and at the time, some of the technological and physiological challenges they were facing.

If you're a history, aviation, or old movie fan, then Dive Bomber will be a good way to spend a couple hours on a winter night. Even more enjoyable if you watch it with a couple flying buddies and a moderate number of adult beverages.

The ""plot"" is the work of flight surgeons to solve some thorny problems in aviation medicine -- blackouts at high G forces, high altitude flying, fatigue.  Errol Flynn and Fred McMurray well carry the human part of the film.  But what makes ""Dive Bomber"" a great film is its unmatched technicolor view of U.S. naval aviation as World War II approached.

No doubt medical researchers and aviation buffs will find fault with some details in the film.  I didn't much like a comedic subplot involving a sailor who married rashly.  The film's ""drama"" is less than compelling.

But the film is significant and poignant because the hot aircraft shown in the film -- the Douglas TBD ""Devastator"" torpedo bomber and the Vought SB2U ""Vindicator"" dive bomber -- would prove unequal to the Japanese.  Many of the naval aviators who were extras and flew in the formation shots would die at Midway and in other battles.  As Admiral Nagumo said in the film ""Midway,"" ""they fight like Samurai, these Americans.""  And the USS Enterprise, featured in the film, eventually the most decorated ship in World War II, would see her share of loss and agony.

Directed by Michael Curtiz

Lieutenant Commander Joe Blake (Fred MacMurray), Lt. Tim Griffin (Regis Toomey), and Lt. Swede Larson (Louis Jean Heydt) are longtime US Navy flying buddies, about to be transferred to different posts when Larson suffers a blackout during high-altitude maneuvers and cracks up. Navy doctor Douglas Lee (Errol Flynn) insists on trying to save him with an immediate operation, and the mortally injured pilot dies on the table. This sets the stage for a long, lingering, and bitter hatred between Blake and Lee - which is only exacerbated when Lee chooses to become a flight surgeon so he can help to find a solution to the problem of high altitude blackout. Lee is assigned to medical research with Lt. Cdr. Lance Rogers (Ralph Bellamy), a flight surgeon whose dedication to high-altitude research has left him unfit for further flying. Their work proceeds through small triumphs and terrible tragedy, and Lee and Blake keep crossing paths, unwillingly - they not only don't like each other personally, but end up competing for the attentions of the same woman (Alexis Smith) at one point. But they're forced to work together for the good of the service, even after Lee grounds Tim Griffin as medically unfit to keep flying. A fresh tragedy shows Blake that Lee has always been looking out for the best interests of the pilots, and they begin working together in earnest, at last.

If you want to see the kind of planes the Navy was flying in the late 30's, though, there is no better film. Look for the Consolidated Coronado 4-engine flying boat in one scene- a flying dinosaur!

this movie helped to show the real struggles that were taking place during this era. i would recommend that anyone who wants to learn about history and also watch a good movie buy this one!",1246147200,,296,4.192982456140351
494394,4,6302682614,"I love this movie...but I'm an aviation geek and seeing this film in all it's restored technicolor glory is a real treat for me because I can sit there and say stuff like, ""Wow!  It's an SBU in pre-war colors!"" and ""Zow!  That's great footage of a pre-war Naval Air Station--look at that PBY!""

If that doesn't switch your switch, and you don't know a PBY from SBU, then this film might not do it for ya.  There are two problems that might confuse a ""film buff"" who sees this movie based on the quality of the cast.  One, Fred McMurray and Errol Flynn are cast against type.  McMurray is the dashing aviator and Flynn is the nerdy doctor/scientist.  Right...

Forcing myself to remember that Flynn is the ""brainiac"" and McMurray is the fly-boy strained my brain.  I don't know why they cast the film this way but I have a feeling that it was deliberate.  You may find it intriguing, I found it distracting.

Problem two is the ""plot.""  I'll give the filmmakers credit for not making this movie too sappy and avoiding allowing a ""love story"" to overwhelm the aerial action.  No mushy stuff!  But this movie is, without a doubt, for aviation geeks like me, and so the plot is a trifle confusing because the screenplay mixes up about a half-dozen different medical conditions and treats them as a single problem, and that's not accurate.  That's like dive bombing in a...in a... in a PBY!  The horror!

So, if you just happen to be geeky enough to know what G-LOC, nitrogen narcosis, altitude sickness, hypoxia and ""the bends"" are and what causes them, this movie will drive you to distraction because the script writers did not know and mix them all up.  In other words, for a film about science, the science is a little weak.

But that won't matter unless you a real aviation geek--but who else is going to give this movie four stars?

Final answer--if you want to see a great color film from 1939 and and you care more about SBU's than ruby slippers or plantations, then this for you.",1245542400,,1984,4.504201680672269
494395,3,6302682614,"""Dive Bomber"" has become somewhat of a cult film for aviation history buffs.  The Hollywood quality color filming of Navy aircraft during the last days of golden wing schemes and some aircraft in pre-WWII gray make this DVD well worth it as a documentary.  Now, if you are more inclined for film history and great past performances, I doubt thus will ever rate as a must see classic.  Flynn's role as a dedicated Doctor with little other interest in wild adventure or women certainly makes an interesting footnote to casting, but otherwise, the aircraft have the most solid performance.  That cigarettes play such a part in virtually every non-flying scene - no wonder these guys were passing out.  Well worth it for aviation history but perhaps ""Citizen Lame"" for a classic film.",1227398400,,780,4.878787878787879
494514,5,6302682614,"A bit hokey in spots but, as a whole, not a bad film.  Errol Flynn has to prove himself to a group of pilots as he assists Ralph Bellamy in experiments to help pilots overcome high altitude sickness. He earns his wings and becomes totally absorbed in the trials.  One by one, members of the group who opposed him at first are lost. But Errol will help save the day! Great aerial and ground scenes, I believe filmed at at San Diego. The colors are great. As an aircraft afficionado, it is great for me to see Grumman F3F's (from Air Group 6, USS Enterprise), Douglas TBD Devastators which gained a negative claim to fame as very few of them survived the battle of Midway, and early model Vought SB2U Vindicators. The aircraft are brilliantly painted in peacetime colors. Look for the British ""fighter""! The studio used a fixed gear Ryan trainer and jazzed it up to make it look like a hot fighter. Why they put a cowling used on an air cooled engine on a water cooled plane is odd. The propellor spinner is at the top of the cowling whereas on an aircooled engine it would be in the center. Oh well, nobody's perfect. It's still a good movie, definetly worth the cost!",1212537600,,1167,4.398148148148148

494516,5,6302682614,"I am a current US Naval Flight Surgery student.  As is the case with most people, I imagine, I enjoy seeing movies that I feel I can personally relate to or that relay my career to the masses.  Imagine my surprise when I found out that a movie had been created about a profession as obscure of US Naval Flight Surgery!  And it was made in the early 1940's, none-the-less!!  This movie is an entertaining fictional view of those servicemen and women who's duty it is to ""Keep 'Em Flyin'"".  It follows Eroll Flynn, the lead, playing the roll of a junior Naval Medical Officer.  After witnessing an aviation mishap, he decides that his clinical and research skills would be of better use study the ills of Naval Aviation, specifically gravitational force induced loss of consciousness (G-LOC) and hypoxia (low oxygen, in this case because of high altitudes).  The story follows Flynn's flight training at Naval Station North Island in San Diego, CA, and his subsequent research into keeping his pilots in the air and alive.  Those who are looking for a good old fashioned WWII airplane dogfight movie will likely be disappointed, but for anyone who is a bit curious about the doctors behind the scenes who spend countless hours making sure that the pilot in the plane is fit enough to complete the mission, this movie will be a rewarding watch.",1200614400,2,1341,4.725321888412017
494517,5,6302682614,"In the 21st century, good film footage of U.S. naval aircraft from the 1930s and early 1940s is tough to find.  ""Dive Bomber"" is a gold mine for anyone interested in those planes, whether as a historian, scale modeler, or just an aviation buff.  The multiple flying scenes of TBD Devastators, for example, are especially poignant for those who are well versed in their near total immolation during the Battle of Midway, a short year or so after this movie was made.  Indeed, it's likely that many of the TBDs seen here went on to glory at Midway.  It's for this reason alone (the historical value of the terrific aviation film footage) that I give it five stars.  Whether the script itself deserves such a ranking is another matter, but I'd turn the sound completely off and still rate this movie as outstanding.",1195603200,,812,4.65034965034965
494518,5,6302682614,"This movie is a fun story, plus an important piece of history.  This is the only film I know which features the USS Enterprise aircraft carrier CV-5 air group operations in color!  The real heroes of this film are the Douglas TBD Devestator torpedo bombers (the ones with the big rounded tail surfaces, and the long graceful canopy).  These planes, and the men who fly them in the movie, were the actual planes and men who fought and died at the battle of midway in world war two.  While the supposed star of the movie is the Vindicator SB2U dive bomber, these were replaced by more capable Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers by the time Pearl Harbor was attacked (later in the same year this film was produced).

Fred McMurray (who did a lot of Disney movies) does a great job portraying life as a naval aviator in 1941.  The plot and story is fine, but the buildings at San Diego Naval Air Station at Coronado and the planes and the USS Enterprise are the big stars of this film for me.  This is a must have movie for any world war two history buff.",1188518400,,1051,4.358974358974359
494519,5,6302682614,"A true aviation buff's film!  Not a war film, but a pre-war film about the approaching conflict the US would soon find itself in and the problems aviation medicine faced in it's attempts to keep the American pilot number 1 in the skies.  The flying sequences are beautifully handled with only minor model work (during the two crash scenes) and the film appeared well researched (though the Navy did not use the high pressure suit during the war).  Like the mini-documentary hosted by Robert Osborne says on the DVD, ""What's not to like?""  It's got Errol Flynn, Fred MacMurray, Ralph Bellamy, the rousing score by Max Steiner and the aircraft of US Naval Aviation in all those colorful pre-war paint jobs in vivid Technicolor!  Bravo!",1179014400,,733,4.832
494520,4,6302682614,"Got your attention?  This isn't about cowardly action, not with Flynn and MacMurray and Bellamy, but it does have those fantastic shots of pre-war naval planes with those yellow wings.  For those who model the era this is a great movie.  Video transfer is good and so is the sound.  If you're into avaiation films you need to add this one to your collection.",1178496000,,358,4.546875
494521,5,6302682614,"I love this film. OK, the plot is pretty simple and doesn't rise above the level of a soap and its technical and historical accuracy is more than a little shaky at points. Errol Flynn seems to be slightly miscast though Fred MacMurray fits the bill perfectly as a stalwart Navy pilot.

That said it is a creation of its time and one has to remember the circumstances in which the film was made - the era immediately prior to war when aviation was at its most glamourous, when right and wrong involved clear cut alternatives and the American people wanted to be reassured of the nobility of those who served.

But when it comes to colour film of pre-war US Navy aircraft and aircraft carriers it can't be beat. The real stars are the aeroplanes - yellow wing Devastators, Vindicators and Helldivers - and I can't think of any other motion picture that captures these sort of images. The shots of aircraft being launched off the USS Enterprise (I think) are particularly memorable.

So for those of us who love aviation this film is very definitely one for Saturday night with a good glass of wine and a decent cigar. As an added bonus there is the occasional interlude with Alexis Smith looking rather fetching.",1176249600,3,1210,4.592592592592593
494522,4,6302682614,"I bought Dive Bomber for two reasons:
(1) Technicolor: brings history to life. Dive Bomber is well worth a look if only for the shots that chronicle a ship, the 1941 ""Enterprise"" (and her aeroplanes, of course) destined for the fiercest battles in the Pacific War. She was to become the most decorated U.S. navy ship of WWII.
(2)Michael Curtiz, that great if excentric journeyman director. Just as in the ""Adventures of Robin Hood,"" or ""Casablanca"" Curtiz, shows his versatility in handling disparate subject material, by giving you a real sense of narrative mood.

Curtiz's spectacular color flying shots of planes; taking off from and landing on ""Enterprise,"" flying in echelon, or peeling out in diving formations are all the more impressive when remembering the burdensome nature of three strip technicolor cameras. He even uses formations of planes as cinematic ""depth cues"" in his ground action shots by having them fly towards the camera from the horizon.

Since Dive Bomber was made at a time when Americans sensed that they would soon be drawn into the world war. Historical timing allows Dive Bomber to concentrate on the patriotic positives and avoid the rallying anti-Japanese and German propaganda/melodrama requisite to the war films it preceeded. The action took a kind of anticipatory  documentary form, stressing the dedication and courage of Navy fighting men ready to meet an expected if not 'real and present danger'.

The Documentrary form was most conspicuous in scences of laboratory research tests on high altitude sickness and G-forces associated with planes becoming sophisticated enough to make these conditions problematic.

Dive Bomber a ""man's"" film, with emphasis on Camaraderie and getting the job done, with the love interest between Flynn and Alexis Smith relegated to subplot.

This unromantic Flynn is a departure from his romantic lead persona, but I found an avenue of connection through his use of a couple of oldtime ""Australian-isms; the word play on MacMurray's character name, Joe Blake;
""... before I punch that 'Joe Blake' (snake) on the nose."" and
""...we've been 'busier than a couple of one-armed paperhangers!'""

Fred MacMurray and Herbert Anderson (Lt. (j.g.) 'Chubby' Markham, MD) in Dive Bomber, still had their good looks 13 years later in the Caine Mutiny - how sad the years were so kind to Flynn.",1174003200,7,2351,5.171052631578948
494523,3,6302682614,"If this were a documentary it would deserve a 5. Not only are the (barely) pre-War airplanes the stars of the show, but the gorgeous color photography of the San Diego area in '40-'41 is well worth the price of the DVD. But... it's supposed to be a movie, with characters, plot and all that good  stuff, and this one doesn't rise much above the soap opera level on that score. Even at the documentary level there were some rather heavy duty security restrictions in place - one is free to doubt that, contrary to what the characters say,  dive attacks were being made from 50,000 feet! Still, watching all those Vindicator dive bombers and pilots, knowing the sad fate which lay in store for these very people at Midway a little over a year later, makes it a very special memorial.",1156550400,21,781,4.492957746478873

When it came out in VHS , I bought it and discovered it was in COLOR , showing the spectrum of late Pre-War USN aircraft (Douglas TBDs, Grumman F3Fs,Vought SB2Us, NAF N3Ns,Northrop BT-1's, etc) that were later overshadowed and obsoleted by the WWII Generation of USN machines. my VHS equipment eventually died and I waited, and waited for it to be released in DVD / Blue-Ray. Finally it is here ! From a visual standpoint , this is a feast for the markings historian and aviation enthusiast !. The Story - allegedly a paean to the Flight Surgeons of the USN -  is a little thin, though. The comparatively crude medical equipment seen in the movie is a reminder of just how far Aviation Medicine has come since 1939. As a pilot, I was intrigued with the fact that all the pilots and doctors smoked (!) in practically every scene - even in the ambulance after the obligatory crash scene. Ralph Bellamy (was he EVER young?) stars as the crusty Flight Surgeon who inspires Errol Flynn (also an M.D.) to volunteer for flight training. When I started my own flight instruction years later, I was scared to death that my ""Schneider Index"" ( the Bogey Man of this movie) would ground me too, until I was told (by a kindly AME) that there was no such thing! I also had to laugh over the scenes where Navy Aircrew suited up with high altitude diver-like suits, then crawled into the Douglas TBD ( a low altitude torpedo bomber) so they could make low altitude formation passes over NAS North Island.. The scenes of the Grumman F3F ( Fred MacMurray - in the above-mentioned high altitude rig - piloting) climbing to altitude (with the canopy open) , are alone worth the price of the movie !  But - notwithstanding the above gaffes, this is one of the best (if not THE Best) of the late Pre-War movies about U.S. Airpower. Highly recommended!",1484006400,,1997,4.438692098092643
