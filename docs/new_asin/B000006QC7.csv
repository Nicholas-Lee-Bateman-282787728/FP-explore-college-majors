7904672,5,B000006QC7,"I have loved this video tape of hauntings ever since I saw it from my old library. This is without a doubt the creepiest haunting video that I have ever seen!  The narrorator is really good and the footage is really creepy! Like you would expect anything else from A and E's great shows?  I'm an adult and every time I see this video again, I can honestly say it creeps me out.  This video seems kinda of expensive for a video tape, so I think I'll wait until until it come out on DVD. A and E please bring this ""scary"" show to DVD soon!",1092268800,5,537,4.047169811320755
