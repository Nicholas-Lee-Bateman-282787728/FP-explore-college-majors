I highly recommend it.",1296691200,5,140,5.086956521739131
4209810,5,B003VOVVWS,"At first I thought that this would just be another filler series for me while I waited for something more significant to come out.  Well, I absolutely loved it!! It was a sleeper series for me and I couldn't have been any happier with it.  The characters and their personalities are fun to watch and when it was over I wanted more.  It is a light hearted series that someone of any age will be able to enjoy.",1292457600,10,408,4.205128205128205

4209812,4,B003VOVVWS,"Bamboo Blade, an anime that you won't typically find remarkable but at the same time you will enjoy every moment when watching, it may not rank as anime of the year but one thing it has above virtually all anime out there in recent years, is that it's simply suitable for any age, there's no fanservice, swearing or anything remotely wrong in this show.

The story is based around Kendo, a teacher with little to no prospects in life finds himself in charge of the schools Kendo team and tasked with recruiting a team of 5 girls to go up against his best friend, and also rivals Kendo team from another school.

Initially focusing on the recruitment of the characters and the building of a team, Bamboo Blade introduces some fairly ordinary characters into the mix, certainly not the kind of people you would expect to play Kendo.

Tama is a Kendo goddess, showing all the remarkable reflex's and skill to become a Kendo champion, when she is introduced to the story she in my eyes becomes the main character of the show. Tama loves anime, she initially doesn't want to get involved with the team as she is a shy, yet quiet girl.

This in my eyes is where Bamboo Blade excels. Although a lot of the focus is on Tama, the story switches between the characters such as Kirino, and the other girls in the team, and goes a little into their personalitys, background and generally tries to get you the viewer to accept them.

Now with this being said, a lot of the story is based around the high school, and the team training for matches, finals, tournaments. Whilst this is going on it delves into Tamas character.

Bamboo Blade has a lot to offer for anyone looking for a more laid back anime. It has a lot of emphasis on character interaction, slice of life elements, and the basic love hate characters that pop up during the story.

I like the series. The dub is alright too, animation is good.",1289606400,35,1893,4.4854651162790695

4209824,3,B003VOVVWS,"Sensei Toriji, is a second rate Kendo instructor. One day a girl named, Tamaki, catches Toriji's attention. Tamaki's lightning fast reflexes could make her a star pupil on the Kendo team and redeem him. But how can Toriji convince her to join the team?

When awkward and loner Tamaki decides to join the team, it makes all the difference. Her joining not only helps the team become better competitors with the bamboo blade, but she is able to make a lot of friends and feel like she is apart of something. The girls work hard to go from an embarrassing group to fierce competitors.

This is a cute and simple anime with endearing characters. It's a bit slow paced and boring at times, but there are lot's of fun moments too. I think younger kids would get the most enjoyment out of this anime. (26 episodes) (It comes in both English and Japanese languages.)",1388016000,,858,4.564935064935065

I've been a fan of this anime since I found out about it a couple years ago from the Funimation channel. Since the channel is no longer on TV, this is a much better solution that watching online.

4209845,5,B003VOVVWS,"Awesome.  Really to mirror the art and structure of kendo.  Not a typical martial arts comedy, but definitely has viewing pleasure.  Every character got enough back story to not make it work really well into a story.  Come on, who doesn't like the little fat kid with the hot girlfriend that has a demented alter ego?",1360368000,,317,4.607142857142857
4209846,3,B003VOVVWS,"Okay so I didn't hate this show, but I definitely expected more action. To me it was just a bunch of school girls playing with sticks. Even in real life Kendo is a respectable sport, but in this show it is a farce. Yes the characters learn valuable lessons, but it seems as though they were just thrown in. As far as a comedy goes, this show was funny and I liked the wide variety of character types, but I wish that it hadn't been based from tournament to tournament. The lack of deep story and more action was just not what I was expecting.
Overall its not a bad anime if you are looking for a laid back, cute, funny, HS girl drama series.",1356998400,3,641,4.136

Just looking at the face of the Tomake Kowazoe character makes me laugh. Classic manga features.

The animation in this anime is good, and so is the voice acting. I can't call the soundtrack memorable, but it's not bad. There's nothing bad about this anime. I kinda wish they would make an OVA or a 2nd season to wrap it up, but it really doesn't need it. I just like to spoiled. Spoil yourself and buy Bamboo Blade.",1349827200,2,618,4.15

4209851,5,B003VOVVWS,"I was first attracted by this as something my 8 year old daughter (and kendo student) might like - I was very pleasantly surprised by the overall quality and my daughter loved it.  The kendo was mostly spot on too - lots of stuff very familiar to us!  Practicing a fairly uncomon martial art in the US, this was really a nice find.",1348358400,2,331,4.238095238095238
4209852,5,B003VOVVWS,"This isn't quite as 'spoof-y' as High School Rumble, you really don't need knowledge of a lot of Japanese pop culture to understand most jokes.  There are a few little jokes and references that might be more amusing with said knowledge though.  For example, the sensei driving the Honda Integra in the first episode is a spoof of Initial D.  Then the scene where Tama-chan is watching the 80s/90s robo-anime similar to Ultraman, complete with cheesy 70s Japanese disco-pop music.  These little jokes continue, but they aren't the central humor in the series.

If you watch the first episode you probably will either be hooked or bored.  I was hooked within minutes.  Notably when the teacher suddenly gets serious about his kendo club in order to win a bet for free sushi for a year.  I was laughing out loud.  ""Authentic Edo style sushi!!!""  Pretty silly and funny.

One note I might add, I actually prefer this series in Japanese.  The English dub is good, but a rather ordinary Funimation dub.  The Japanese language is pretty funny.  You get the 'eeeeehhhhh?s and iiiiiieeeeeee...s' and other fun little sounds that make the jokes even more amusing.  Even if you don't understand Japanese, it's a delight to listen to.  And the subtitles are pretty spot on.  They don't tend to change the Japanese phrases so much that you miss the original joke in order to make it more 'Westernized'.

Animation quality is above average.  I wasn't expecting it to be quite as good.  It's mostly on a level with School Rumble or other mid 2000s series.  Not quite the big budget animation of Gundam or Fullmetal type series; but noticeably better than many Geneon releases for example.  Animation is crisp and clean with good shading.  The characters are all unique and have interesting drawings to match their individual personalities.

The story follows the fun and silly times of the kendo club.  The kendo bouts are very interesting and well animated.  The creators actually phase out part of the face mask so you can see the participant's face during bouts.  It's an interesting and well done aspect of the series.  In reality, the masks cover the face completely.  The time spent away from the kendo club is also quite fun and feel good.  You have a coming of age, high school comedy with some light hearted moments but also some semi-serious ones.  By that I mean the 'who likes whom' and 'I need to hit the books to get better grades' and such.  There is a bit of situational comedy, but nothing risque.

There is no overt sexual innuendo, nor is there fan service.  It's a series appropriate for most ages.  I myself am in my early 30s and have been watching anime since I was a kid; I still enjoyed this series quite a bit.  It has a little nostalgia for the days of high school (though less so since it is Japanese school - quite different in many ways from American school).  Despite being a foreign production, the viewer can empathize with the characters.  The comedy is well played.  Characters are likable, which is something I can't say for every coming of age anime series.

Overall I rate this as one of the better coming of age / high school comedies with a positive message.  It's not as risque as Genshiken, not as kiddy-fied as Azumanga Daioh, nor as silly with the Japanese pop culture references as School Rumble.  I highly recommend this for those who like light hearted and fun comedy anime series.",1347494400,6,3413,4.686340640809443
4209853,5,B003VOVVWS,"I originally saw this show subbed online, and knew within a few episodes I had to own it.  When FUNimation announced the license I couldn't of been happier.

It has action, good animation, and interesting characters.  It does focus on only female characters, but it's not played for fan service.  It's suitable for all ages, male or female.

It's also one of the few shows I enjoy subbed over dubbed.

The storyline does have one minor flaw in 2 episodes near the end, but I believe it's a matter of cultural differences.",1343865600,2,521,4.608695652173913
4209854,5,B003VOVVWS,"This is a wonderful, heartwarming, sweet, and funny anime series, that I wish had more episodes. I thoroughly enjoyed it and it is one of those series that you just never get tired of watching. I could easily watch this show over and over again.",1339891200,3,245,4.466666666666667
4209855,5,B003VOVVWS,"Balancing comedy, drama and action can be difficult, particularly over the course of a 26 episode ongoing story.  Bamboo Blade does this exceptionally well not only by presenting the sport of kendo as a backdrop in an interesting an reverent manner, but also by realizing the true story arrises from engaging characters and their personal journeys.

Muroe High's kendo club's year is off to a less than stellar start.  They only have four returning members (three of which hardly ever attend practice, including two who are violence hungry bullies), team captain-by-default Kirino's constantly struggles to get their half-hearted advisor to instruct them properly, and their best first-year prospect (Tamaki) is a prodigy trained from an early age who sees no point in joining a club for something she does everyday at home.

But a side bet with an old friend reignites their advisor's passion, and between inspiration from the hero of Tamiki's favorite anime show and a lifetime of respectful kendo this pintsized powerhouse can't stand by when she sees the bullies in action...

Bamboo Blade has a great core cast, eventually consisting of seven club members and their teacher.  Each has different reasons for joining the club and practicing kendo, and the series takes time to explore each one's motivations and the effects the club and their new friends have on them.  Practices and downtime make up as much of the series as tournaments and matches do, which provides a nice pace and time to get to know and care about the team.  Add in various other teams they face along the way as friends as well as enemies, and there's a lot to follow and get absorbed in.

The series could have benefitted from a few more episodes, as once they caught up to the manga this is based on there weren't all that many left to wrap up things up and a couple resolutions were rushed, but they did an excellent job with what they had and the story continued strongly even after the anime diverged from the source material (which can't often be said).

I thoroughly enjoyed following Tamaki and her team through their adventures and getting to learn a lot about a fascinating sport as well.  Overall Bamboo Blade is a great sport based anime that's a ton of fun.

Highly recommended.",1339200000,5,2267,4.829457364341085
4209856,5,B003VOVVWS,"I have to be honest, when I first read the description one usually runs into on anime sites, I thought, ""Oh, man.  This sounds lame...and boring...and predictable.""

However, I'm glad that I have developed the habit to give any series at least three episodes - unless the first episode is so darn horrid, I'd rather stick myself with a fork than watch another episode.  It didn't take three episodes, it only took one to show me that this was something surprisingly worthwhile.

For the most part, Bamboo Blade's strong point is in its amazing array of fresh, well-developed characters.  One who watches enough anime will spot the usual assortment of stock characters, whom you could almost predict word-for-word each line they'll speak.  However, for the most part, these characters are well-developed, complex, and generally do not make the expected choice.

The plot doesn't get into a rut, since it is several interlaced subplots of each character, it keeps moving forward, and kept me interested and wondered what to expect next. There's one character that I'd nominate as the angriest anime character since Asuka Langley Soryu from Evangelion - but the personality development is amazing and one of the most enjoyable surprises of this series.

If you're looking for kick-ass action or ecchi fanservice, it's not here - and it doesn't need to be.  But if you want a good, solid, entertaining series full of engaging characters and wonderfully-written scenes, I'd recommend this wholeheartedly.",1337990400,4,1499,5.135802469135802
4209857,5,B003VOVVWS,This series has a really good story line and charaters that really stay with you. The first thing you notice as things get started is that all the characters have an underlying weakness and that they really don't know how to solve it at first. The most fun in this series is watching them struggle with and over come each of their weaknesses and become a better person in the end. I found this journey to be very entertaining and fullfilling. Nice job!,1329350400,3,452,4.457831325301205
4209858,5,B003VOVVWS,I looked into this series on Hulu when Amazon recommended it (you might also like...) and I've really enjoyed it. This set has all the episodes at a decent price.

4209859,4,B003VOVVWS,"Bamboo Blade is an anime released in 2007 and is based on the Japanese manga of the same name.  Written by Masahiro Totsuka and released under the direction of Hisashi Saitou, Blade tells the story of Kojiro, a comically unlucky high school kendo sensei tasked with the training of five girls.

To begin with, it should be noted that my personal preference concerning series-style anime falls aggressively outside of this particular genre.  My favorites are Samurai Champloo, Afro Samurai, and Ergo Proxy, to name a few.  The are clearly successful but mainstream titles.  Because of this, I thought I'd do well to broaden my horizons and picked up Bamboo Blade on some instinctual whim.  This can be blamed partially on the cover art but mostly in an attempt to find something my wife would enjoy with me.  She's Japanese and leans a bit more towards the bubbly side of anime.

Neither of us were disappointed.

The show is oddly funny and I like that.  Sometimes cheeky but more often sly, the jokes pop up randomly and are finely executed.  My wife finds a bit more humor in the show than I do but I often catch myself laughing and looking forward to certain characters because of it.  Dan-kun, for example, is voiced expertly by Akira Ishida and an absolute joy to listen to.  So much so that I'll be looking for works with his involvement specifically.  The man is funny.

The animation is top shelf considering the show's length and it's obvious that great effort was put into making Bamboo Blade look as nice as it does.  I think there's a token structure here regarding the character designs but the detail in the clothing and environments leave nil to be desired.  It's of some interest to me, also, that the animation style will change within an episode depending on the mood.  The majority of the work is of the solid anime-style animation, but when the mood turns goofy, so does the penciling.  I imagine the switch is prevalent in anime but it's not something I'm used to and I've found it a refreshing wiggle.

The character development is legitimate regardless of the simple storyline.  It all boils down to five girls training in kendo, which is fairly unremarkable, but as the show progresses they become cleverly individualized through their own background stories and nuances.  Miya-Miya, for example, moves along at an intriguing pace and I was excited to learn more about her as the show worked towards its climax.

It was also nice to learn a little about kendo.  As with any sport, especially in uptight Japan, there are tried practices and procedures to be adhered to and it seems they've exhibited a dedication to these here.  They break down the steps, the swings, the pain, and the bouts.  You'll learn a little about the gear and a lot about their battle-screams.  If you're interested in kendo, this could be worth your time.

Now, if you're a highly conservative parent and are planning on handing this off to your child, you may want to do some online reviewing of the content.  Note that I said, ""highly conservative"", though.  There are teenage Japanese girls in their school attire which can be titillating for some, I imagine.  The skirts are short and the show tends to showcase that lack of fabric on occasion.  You don't see underwear but there are implications.  Legs and breasts are zoomed in on here and there but it never gets nasty.  Just be warned.

In the end, I think my only complaint would be the flat plot.  There's not much flare in the everyday and this show definitely focuses on the everyday.  As I said before, however, the characters and humor written in more than make up for this.

Considering the low prices I'm seeing on Amazon, I'd recommend adding this to your library.

Thanks for your time,

4209861,5,B003VOVVWS,"""Bamboo Blade"" is one of those rare gems that doesn't bring something ""revolutionary"" to the anime plate, but has so much sustenance and an awesome story.

FOR THE PARENTS (CONTENT REVIEW)):
A good bunch of anime that take the ""all-girl-whatever"" approach (whether it is sports team, classroom, etc.) often end up falling into a fanservice (provocative material) or harem romance show with a lot of awkward scenes. BUT Bamboo Blade completely avoids such cliches and material.  They are just an all girl team with two male members besides the teacher...nothing more nothing less...and no gimmicks.  Absolutely no fanservice (not even the notorious ""beach scene"")...and no coarse language (unless you consider ""crap"" to be one).  You don't need all of that stuff to make a ""realistic"" anime or a ""good"" anime.  It's very much a family safe series.

MOVING ON:
That said, ""Bamboo Blade"", as I said before, does not bring anything ""new"" or ""revolutionary"".  But ""newness"" is not what makes a great show.  A good narrative is what makes it.  In a nutshell, this is a slice-of-life anime that that mixes humor, serious character development, a strong overarching plot-line with complimenting subplots, and important life lessons.  To be honest, with such a maxim as ""they fight for sushi"" on it's back cover, you wouldn't expect much from the plot except some slapstick humor.  I did when I first saw the cover.  But the thing is, there is so much goodness to glean from this show.  It's much more serious than the cover lets on, but not so much that it's a drag.  Lessons about growing up, taking ownership, the value of winning, the value of losing, finding a new strength that you never thought you had, the benefits of a healthy and good rival, strength of teamwork & friendship, new beginnings, redemption, and a good definition of what true and fulfilling fun is versus the old and familiar (unfortunately) maxim, ""if it's not fun it's not worth it"".  It also highlights what true healthy competition can be...where opponents can come together and compete not only to win, but in hopes of learning from each other...and without the need of smack talk or flamboyant entrances to prove your toughness.

some other amazing  aspects about the show was the accuracy of many of the Kendo techniques they used, the courtesy and etiquette exhibited (was actually really nice), the way the main characters interacted, and the way they brought in new characters and made them key players (even if they only showed up for a few episodes).  The ""everyday"" feel was wonderful, too.  Also, it was very easy to connect with all the characters and situations at a personal level.

Also, the ending is one of the most satisfying I've seen with a lot of anime.  It does a complete closure that allows you to end with it then and there, but allows for a possible 2nd season if they so choose.  Also, the dubbing is actually very very good.  In fact, in this case, I prefer the dub over sub to a very great degree.  The voices fit the characters well.

All in all, this is one of my favorite shows.  It's no Gundam or Naruto...but to be honest, I prefer this kind of anime over many of those flashy (and notoriously long) popular anime.  It carries great entertainment and great lessons.  Definitely for one looking for a more positive fare on life.  So, I do hope you get this and you enjoy :-)",1326240000,3,3376,4.752577319587629
4209862,4,B003VOVVWS,"Bamboo Blade brings a surprising total package of not just being a slap-stick series where its just zany, Japanese humor.  Viewers will come to enjoy an anime that covers a very unique and serious sport in Japanese culture, the sword arts of Kendo, while keeping it lighthearted.  The humor and the silly characters assemble, yet there are moments of serious thought and drama.  Sort of in the tradition of Azumanga Daioh, Bamboo Blade takes the challenges of several Kendoka and their dim-witted coach as they traverse the world of sword fighting.

The real charm of the series are the ensemble of characters.  The main character, Tamaki is lovable from the start.  She's a quiet high school freshman who would prefer watching her favorite series, the Brave Bladers, at home rather than do Kendo.  But after some cajoling from the Muroe High School kendo coach and seeing the ""ijime"" (bullying) of a new kendo student, she enters the fledgling club to exact justice like her favorite Brave Blader, the Red one.  She has an irresistible youthful innocence as she runs into the harsher realities of growing up, such as facing her anxieties at a part time job, running into shady people, and the reality of tough competition in the kendo world.

Meanwhile, the coach of the Muroe High School Kendo team, who is in it because he has to fill his stomach and pay his bills, and the captain of the original team, Kirino, have to assemble a new squad.  They get one of the most strange looking anime characters ever, Eiga (""Dan-kun"") who looks like an acorn and talks very slow.  He decides to bring his girlfriend, Miya-miya, who walks in as being very gorgeous.  Yet Dan-kun's lady friend has a dark side to her, which has a continuous humorous arc as her mood shifts from being ""black,"" a reference to the bad guy on the Brave Blader series to lovable and kind when Dan-kun is around.  Other characters on the team include a very gung-ho, but dim-witted Saya, good, all-around good-guy Yuuji, and later on, a klutz named Satorin.  Together, they struggle as a team to get wins and learn the art of kendo.

The humor and story arc make for a fine finish to the series.  One of the more interesting plot points is the Muroe High School's interaction with other kendo teams' characters, so its not just watching one set of characters throughout the entire show with only importance placed on them.  You meet new side characters from other high schools through competitions either become friend or foe, which can be extremely funny or dramatic.  Also is the Brave Bladers arc that is behind the show, which brings humor, a side culture that pays homage to old anime classics, and inspiration for some of characters like Tamaki and Yuuji.

I guess the only downgrade for the series is that the humor sometimes becomes a little much, in particular an introduction of a foreigner character who is totally stereotyped (you'll see what I mean).  That's just a minor squibble.

This has been enjoyable and charming series to watch, a recommend for anyone who not enjoys comedies but a very unique culture of kendo, a lesser known martial art in the world.",1325116800,16,3141,4.747697974217311
