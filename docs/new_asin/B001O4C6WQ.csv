8329606,5,B001O4C6WQ,"Great two-DVD set. Famous TV Detectives has two episodes each of Peter Gunn and Richard Diamond, and one episode of Burke's Law. They're the PD versions, of course, so don't expect the famous Mancini theme for Peter Gunn. TV Detectives Volume 1 has an episode of The Lone Wolf, I Am The Law (with George Raft), Treasury Men in Action (featuring Charles Bronson as a psycho smuggler), Checkmate (with Doug McClure and Sebastian Cabot), and Mark Saber of the Homicide Squad (starring Tom Conway). It's a fun DVD set for old TV buffs (like me) and quite a few of these public domain shows are NOT available on YouTube.",1460505600,5,615,4.651376146788991
