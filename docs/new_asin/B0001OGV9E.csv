Episodes
31) Gold Octopus: Prelude to Jiro's Demise - Not a particularly interesting episode.  Gold Octopus seems to be motivated by revenge for all his ""brothers"" that Kikaida has destroyed.  A cliff-hanger ending in which it appears Jiro is destroyed, but, of course, the next episode scene puts that worry to rest.

32) Blue Electric Eel: Accordian Arm Agony (I am not making up these titles, I swear.)  The amnesiac Dr. Kohmyoji, ever helpful, attaches a spare android arm that just happens to be lying around to Jiro, who just happens to be missing an arm.  Oh, no!  It's Blue Electric Eel's arm!

33) Mask Crab Red: Enforcer of the DARK code - Mask Crab Red and King Crab Maroon fight over who gets to give Jiro crabs, I mean, who gets to kill Jiro.  It seems the Destructoids can disobey Gill.

34) Black Spiny Anteater: Destructoid with Child - This one is just awesome, and is the reason to get this disc.  This is both one of the funniest and saddest episodes I've seen.  Black Spiny Anteater has a child Anteater robot who transforms into a little girl.  I could send this in to John Stewart and he could get a dozen ""moments of Zen"" out of this thing.

35) Black Crow: The end of ""The END"" -  Black Crow is immune to Kikaida's special ""The END"" attack.  Oh no!  Lots of creepy little robot crows flapping around.

Special features: part 4 of the 5 part interview with Ban Daisuke (Jiro).  Factoids for episodes 21-30. Also, it looks like the Destructoids sound clips feature might be on all the discs (it's on both discs 7 and 9)",1304294400,,1584,4.475524475524476
