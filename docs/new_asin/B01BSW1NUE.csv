8751273,1,B01BSW1NUE,"Very disappointed in that the DVD is only one solid group (no chapters, no play list, just one big chunk) of interviews, with no ""music videos"" at all.  I love Sia's creativity in her performances, but that's not on the DVD.

I'd give it 0 stars if I could, but I received it via US Mail on a Sunday.  Sunday!  And it wasn't marked ""special delivery""; it was simply pre-ordered with a bunch of other stuff a couple weeks earlier.",1462924800,8,429,4.325
8751274,5,B01BSW1NUE,"Sia gets 5 stars, this DVD deserves a LAME 0. Being a super fan of Sia, I am happy to add this to my collection; however, all this futage is available on YouTube. She is a unique character and an amazing talent.",1462665600,7,211,4.0476190476190474
8751275,2,B01BSW1NUE,GOOD NEWS... Bad News....  Good news is that this DVD is an hour worth of Sia Interviews. I'm a big fan of Sia. I believe she is a genius music writer and composer with an extremely fabulous voice. Sia is my number one favorite since I heard her voice the first time. The bad news is that this DVD was a compilation of short interviews which are mostly already available on YouTube for free. I wish I could get my money back. This is not what I expected at all. Very very disappointed.,1462579200,14,485,4.21505376344086
