8554074,5,B00AMQGHKY,"Both are awesome, widescreen prints.  Easily worth it for any fan of Italian westerns.  ""Death Rides A Horse"" was surprisingly good upon a second viewing, and ""A Reason to Live, A Reason to Die"" was a fun film starring the late Bud Spencer.",1467158400,3,240,4.558139534883721
8554075,5,B00AMQGHKY,"I have always loved spaghetti westerns and these two movies did not disappoint.  The stories were adventurous and hard-edged, and just what I expected.",1439251200,,151,5.291666666666667
8554076,5,B00AMQGHKY,Worth the purchase for Death Rides A Horse Alone. A reason to Live A Reason to Die wasn't as good as Death Ride A Horse which is a classic.,1409529600,3,139,3.8275862068965516
8554077,4,B00AMQGHKY,"I bought this 2 disc DVD set for A Reason to Live...A Reason to Die AKA Massacre at Fort Holman (This is it's first Region One DVD release). Don't get me wrong, Death Rides a Horse is a classic, but if that's what you're after pick up the Wild East DVD release of that film which includes special features.
As for A Reason to Live...A Reason to Die the transfer is great and in widescreen. As for the film itself, well I had high hopes for it based on the fact that it starred James Coburn, Telly Savalas and Bud Spencer and was directed by Tony Valerii (Leone's protg and director of MY NAME IS NOBODY). With those three headlining why wouldn't it be great? Sadly it was pretty run of the mill and was basically a Civil War era Dirty Dozen. I thought it would be interesting to see Bud Spencer as part of such a serious ensemble and I have to say he was the only fun thing about the movie and steals all his scenes. As for Savalas, he's not part of Coburn's Dirty Dozen and is instead the piece's villain.
The action is pretty good in the climax, but with the beautiful Ft. Holman set that isn't hard to accomplish as it does most of the work. As a trivial side note, the McBain house from Once Upon a Time in the West is also featured. If you're a Bud Spencer fan I'd give the film a shot, otherwise its pretty run of the mill only with big stars and big sets.",1358121600,5,1362,4.12406015037594
