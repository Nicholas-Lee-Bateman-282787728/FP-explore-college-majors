8084108,2,B000BB18K4,"The image displayed in the description is of the original anime not the sequel. I ordered this expecting the original but what I got was Knight Hunters: Eternity which IS in the description title. So just be careful and don't make the mistake I did. So I returned it, because Eternity is awful. I poorly written, slow and boring sequel that I wish was never made. It includes all new pointless costume redesigns that are ugly as well. Yes even with the plot holes the original is head and tails above this mess. Skip it. I gave it two stars because our boys are still quite handsome!",1432166400,,583,4.457943925233645
8084109,3,B000BB18K4,First of all it wouldn't do any good to group this anime with its predecessor Knight Hunters. Eternity has a different style for each of the main characters and  spends most of its episodes in the school. It is a decent short anime series if you look past the major changes in character design. I would buy the  Knight Hunters & Knight Hunters Eternity-Complete Thin Pack instead of this product if you do not already own the original series. This package contains both series for a good price and the first series gives the viewer a better understanding on what is happening in certain parts of Knight Hunters Eternity.,1416441600,,620,4.678899082568807

It is such a good story.
Why did the mangaka kill off Ran after only a few years,
which ended the manga?",1335312000,,157,3.9375
8084113,4,B000BB18K4,"Many reviewers are expressing their frustration at this short series for not living up to the original.  Not having seen the original, I can offer an opinion of the series unbiased by comparisons.  As with most Anime, I looked up the series on Wikipedia to distinguish between the characters, the different iterations of the series, etc.  Amazon *does* describe this product accurately, if you read the series description.  If you read the Wikipedia entry, you'd know to be wary of this.

Weiss Kreuz Gluehen (lit. ""Glowing White Cross"") - Knight Hunters Eternity IS separate and different from the earlier series as a result of a lawsuit.  Just the way it is.

That said, artistically I found this series quite beautiful.  The plot starts off a little bit slow, to establish the new characters introduced in this series.  But soon enough the plot thickens, there are twists, turns, betrayals, defiance of orders, and retribution.  Like much Japanese anime, this series does not shirk from killing off major characters, and the body count in this series is staggeringly high.
There's a goodly bit of blood and gore, though not as extreme as say, Elfen Lied.

The animation is well done, the characters have very convoluted, troubled pasts that weigh heavily upon each of them.  The ending of the series is a nominal victory for Weiss, but it takes a heavy, tragic toll on all of them.  Still, it is an emotionally satisfying ending, if you have a sufficient appreciation for tragedy, irony and poetic justice.

I hold back from giving the series 5 stars because of the horrible mispronunciation if the German words used in the series in the English dub.  I cringed at hearing ""Rosenkreuz"" pronounced ""Rosencruise"", and there was not one hint of a German accent among any of the voice actors doing the German characters.  This series was recorded in NYC, and they couldn't cast a single actor who could do a passable German accent for those characters? Unbelievable (and for comparision, Satella Harvenheit in Chrono Crusade was a bit exaggerated in her accent, but at least it was still believable)!  Still, the voice actors did a great job fleshing out their characters, there is a lot of emotion and pathos that went into their various performances, and my hat's off to them.  My favorite voice actors are still the Houston-based ADV Films crew, but these (NYAV Post) were acceptable.

Don't forget to check out the ""outtakes"" feature of the individual volumes...mostly bloopers, and the voice actors/director screwing around & having fun--they are hysterically funny, and this is something I wish ADV Films would do for their DVDs...",1222041600,5,2636,4.9635535307517085
8084114,1,B000BB18K4,I ordered this as decribed knight hunters the first set episodes 1-24 i was sent knight hunters eternity the sequel i called making amazon aware of this fact and returned the dvd to them i have not recieved my money for my return or any varifcation that they received my return info. i filled out i am very disappointed with this and as of now will no longer be using amazon for any other orders.,1199232000,5,396,4.293333333333333
8084115,1,B000BB18K4,"I ordered this item thinking (based on the picture and the title and various other references in the site) that I was getting Knight Hunters Complete Collection. Instead I was sent Knight Hunters Eternity. When I contacted Amazon about this I was intially told basically tough luck, we'll give you a refund, but that's all. Then I called back agian and despite the fact that Amazon misrepresented this item, I was told that the only thing they could give me for my inconvience is $20 off the extremely expensive Knight Hunters Complete Collection (which this is advertised to be) and a refund INSTEAD of properly replacing my product and sending me what I ordered. DO NOT BUY THIS THINKING IT IS KNIGHT HUNTERS COMPLETE COLLECTION! It is instead Knight Hunters Eternity! [...] is misrepresenting this product and they are not doing ANYTHING about it. Shame on them and their horrible customer service.",1195948800,12,901,4.934210526315789
8084116,4,B000BB18K4,Weiss Kreuz Gluhen is a decent series in my opinion. It's not on the great level but it's decent. I loved the characters and the plot went along smoothly. I haven't seen the original series but I hear the character designs were changed due to legal issues. The characters in this season are different from those in the other seasons. This is definitely enjoyable but it's not over the top excellent.,1184112000,6,399,4.633802816901408
8084117,1,B000BB18K4,"I am a major fan of Weiss Kruez, I'm also a huge fan of Schwarz and I was highly disappointed with the animation and character design of Gluhen.  First off, Schuldig was completly ruined in my eyes, even granted that a man with long hair does look slightly feminine, he truly looked like a woman in Gluhen and all that I loved and admired about his character was shattered.  Crawford and Farfarello were even worse, and what happened to Yohji in this?  He get into a fight with a lawn mower and lose?  While I have the highest of praise that can be given to Kapital, the first Weiss Kruez, I have hardly any at all for Gluhen...the plot may have become more tortured and more dramatic, but for ruining probably some of the best villians I've seen in anime, and for downright terrible character designs, I flunk it with as heavy a F as I can give.  Don't watch this part of the series if you are seriously into the Kapital designs, your visions of the characters will be ultimately shattered.  Some got hotter, some just got completly ruined.",1181952000,2,1041,4.4526315789473685
