8355329,5,B00280LRIY,"""Doing the same things over and over again, expecting different results.""  Please, try something different for your game. This DVD has enlightened me why at times things seem to snowball badly in golf, why people feel like they lose their swings, and crumble in competition.  On the other hand, the DVD also explains why when golf is easy, your mind is clear and focused and things are on auto-pilot.  It all comes down to being 'target oriented'...when you are, things tend to turn out good. When you're not, you're worried about all sorts of things.  Colin can show you HOW to do it...once you 'get it', you'll never want to go back to insanity again.",1284681600,,653,4.6521739130434785
