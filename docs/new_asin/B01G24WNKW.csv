7753453,1,B01G24WNKW,"I love bad horror movies. However, this was THE WORST. An hour and a half of talking about college and boyfriends and grilling until, in the last five minutes, cameras fall out of people's hands. The end. WORST. Sorry I couldn't give it zero stars.",1481241600,3,248,4.533333333333333

7753455,1,B01G24WNKW,"This was a horrible movie!  I love the found footage mockumentary movies but this was terrible.  There is building suspense and nothing going on, and this was the latter.  To those who made the movie, watch the good ff movies like The Blair Witch Project.  Seeing these people grill dinner or complain about their daughter does not a good movie make.  There was nothing that had anything to do with purging and there was nothing paranormal about this.  Skip this one.",1477180800,4,467,4.703703703703703
7753456,2,B01G24WNKW,All anticipation...no payoff.. the trailer was better.,1475884800,2,54,6.857142857142857
7753457,1,B01G24WNKW,"This is a bad found footage tape made worse with boring interviews. A family moves to a foggy ski resort town with a reputation. They film horribly and very boring stuff. The lousy footage is interrupted with all kinds of unconvincing interviews letting us know the family disappears or all dies before the event happens. Nothing worth while to see until about an hour into the film, then it was all jerky camera. Most of the time you had to ask, why are they filming this? One of the worst found footage tapes out there. It is shameful that this nonsense passes for entertainment.

Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity.",1473465600,5,615,4.590909090909091
7753458,2,B01G24WNKW,"""Ruthless Studios is the same production studio that also delivered All Hallows Eve and, frankly, nothing has tickled the distinctive quality from either film. The Purging Hour is a low end rental that fails to blend suspenseful drama with suspenseful thriller. Dabbled with touches of key fear elements that does not rendition a bold new of horror, The Purging Hour waits until the very last hour to divulge into the subject matter with anything prior to being a waste of reel.""

7753459,3,B01G24WNKW,"(The Purging Hour) aka (Home Video)  is a straight up Found Footage film. It's slow moving but spends the time building good character development as the family moves in and prepares to spend the night in their new home in the woods.

They also spend time  interviewing friends and family of the family that the story revolves around. Also people that live in the town where the incident occurred.

It's done mockumentary style and is pretty convincing. The acting is good and just seems like any other family. During the interviews each person has his or her theory on what could have happened.

It was OK as far as found footage films go. The climax where they show ""the actual tape"" of some of what happened was creepy and tense. They did a good jod with the suspense. There are was some bloody violence but none  actually caught in the act, thus the mystery. It was an OK watch, but nothing I'd watch again. I rate by Amazon's ratings system, like I stated before 3 means it was OK!",1472774400,5,986,4.4804469273743015
8761970,1,B01G24WNKW,"I thought Paranormal Activity movies were better then this. This just focuses on the dysfunctional family, You see more documentary. More dialogue to it. Just boring til you see the shocking end. Not that shocking.",1532995200,,214,5.142857142857143
8761971,5,B01G24WNKW,"I think I know why this film has such negative reviews.  It does start off slow with the introduction of a family who is obviously a bit dysfunctional and then interviews with the people in the town where this incident occurred, but I happen to like that in a movie, especially found footage.  I found it entertaining throughout and the ending to be very creepy and suspenseful.  This is not the movie for anyone looking for instant action, but if you like a slow build to a story and really getting to know the characters you might like this.",1521504000,,543,4.4646464646464645
8761972,1,B01G24WNKW,"Worst horror movie I've ever watched... and I've watched hundreds. Sometimes even the bad ones have a few good moments in them....lol.... My favorite genre is horror and yes, there are alot of bad ones out there but this one,,, I kept saying out loud... ""What a joke""..... please take my advise and don't waste your time.",1520553600,,321,4.649122807017544
8761973,1,B01G24WNKW,I found this to be a poorly made movie and horrible acting.  Hard to watch with camera moving all over the place. Would not be something I would recommend.,1519516800,,155,4.344827586206897
8761974,3,B01G24WNKW,"I am sitting here confused. This was not the best movie I have ever seen,but was not the worst either. The plot was decent, maybe a bit too subtle, but good nonetheless. The acting was decent also, sound was good, etc. I liked it, and in fact this is the second time I have watched it. I really like found footage movies, and this is a good one. Judge for yourself.",1518566400,,365,4.154929577464789
8761975,1,B01G24WNKW,"Super boring. Waited for the good part and it never came.

Not really sure what happened to the mom and daughter.

Don't watch.",1499472000,,127,4.478260869565218

8761978,1,B01G24WNKW,"First of all - not being able to provide zero stars makes one think that there is some redeeming value to a movie.  I want to be clear about this movie - this movie is ZERO star worthy.  The daughter is hot and the dad is hunky but that does not a movie make.  The movie was scriptless, mindless, soulless (and not because there were cool demons or anything). This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat as you contemplate leaning off your seat to change the channel.  Seroiusly - do not waste your time on this flick as I have done it for your.  I have suffered so that you may be free.",1498003200,7,589,4.043103448275862
8761979,3,B01G24WNKW,"Because everyone says its bad, doesnt make it so. Its really watching a family, with problems..
But they look good. The scenery is nice. I watched it while doing bills, and said, id like that house with mountains.
Too many like slasher movies with sex.
None of that so far.",1497052800,,273,4.48
