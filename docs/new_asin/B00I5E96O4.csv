8639395,5,B00I5E96O4,"This collection consists of carefully culled excerpts from Mr. Cantor's weekly television show that was syndicated in the 1955 television season.  Most of the disc consists of Cantor's vocals of songs long associated with him.  Despite the fact that these were done near the end of his career, and a few years after the onset of his serious heart condition, Cantor captures a fair amount of his old magic and even does a bit of the skipping around that had long been his trademark while singing.  The comedy skits at the end have historical interest, but the best part of this offering is the series of more than a dozen excellent vocals by old Banjo Eyes.",1398902400,8,656,4.637931034482759
