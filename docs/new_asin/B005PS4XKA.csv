This film is not just a sequel but really a ""Part 2"" film. The difference? Just look at what has been done with ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" and Peter Jackson's horrible treatment of ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Hobbit"" and you get the idea. These films represent stories which have been divided into two or more parts and the fulfillment portion of the experience is not complete until all the parts can be viewed in a timely fashion. While this film actually does a good job of standing on its own, to really get a good idea of what has led up to its beginning it's best to see Part I. By the way, the proper title of this film is ""The Valdamar Legacy II: The Forbidden Shadow"".
I'm tempted to compare this film to ""Scooby-Doo"" without the jokes, cheesy monsters or bad acting but that in many ways completely fails to describe it properly in any way. This film has more in common with Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" than with anything Brian Yuzna ever produced. While its not devoid of blood or the grotesque, it most certainly is not a splatter-film and the HDR, which is heavily suffused with sepia-tones makes what gore there is more palatable to the squeamish. This is real Lovecraft, after all, not Stephen King or Wes Craven. This is Lovecraftian literature (which covers plenty of authors such as Robert Bloch, Robert E, Howard and L. Sprague DeCamp who were contemporaries, correspondents and the closest thing to real friends that the reclusive Howard P. Lovecraft ever had) brought to the screen in my opinion for the very first time. One caveat: HPL Historical Society has made two fantastic amateur adaptations - ""The Call of Cthulhu"" and ""The Whisperer In Darkness"" - which are masterfully done, the first as a silent black and white and the second as a black and white talkie. The idea, and it succeeds brilliantly, was to make these films in a style in which Lovecraft might have actually seen them done in his lifetime. Therefore I should say that ""The Valdemar Legacy"" films are the first professionally-produced Lovecraft inspired films since the 1970s which are worthy of the genre.
This film brings the story to an end which is both exciting end. More than Scooby-Doo, this actually reminds me of a good session of the FRPG ""Call of Cthulhu"" which I played a few times back in the 1980s. Prisoners escape only to find that they are the only ones who can stop the cultists from making a bad situation worse. The whole thing culminates in the appearance of a Spawn of Cthulhu (no that's not Cthulhu on the cover, but a smaller minion who resembles and serves him) and the battle to get it to return where it came from. The ending is cheerful for Lovecraft (most of the good-guys survive) but this does not stop the film from being throroughly enjoyable. Unless you really like blood and gore in which case you'll be very dissappointed.
The acting is superb and the film is worthy of if not better than anything which could be produced in Hollywood. This is a Spanish import so you won't recognize the cast unless you watch a lot of Spanish films. I often wonder why it is that it's only indie or foreign filmmakers who can really do Lovecraft justice.
Be warned: this film at the time I'm writing is only available in PAL Region 2 (UK and Europe) DVD so you'll need a multi-region player to watch it. Though the film is in Spanish, it has good English subtitles.",1396656000,8,3430,4.597063621533442
