1196248,5,B000006R0W,"I first saw this movie in 1975 and fell in love with it.  I talked several of my schoolmates into going to see it with me, and soon it sort of became a ""cult hit"" in my school.  I went back several times and even  managed to get the soundtrack. I'm sure the movie studio never understood  why this movie sold so many tickets in Puerto Rico. It is a fun, modern  (1970's) musical, a joy to see. One more thing, the movie is in English.  It doesn't have, nor need subtitles.",960940800,4,472,4.076086956521739
1196249,4,B000006R0W,"Even though I was just a child when I saw this movie, it instantly became a favorite. Probably the best musical ever done, Ranks right up there with ""Fiddler On The Roof"". Amazing musical score and songs. They  deserve to be released on CD now.",940377600,,244,4.4222222222222225

7904817,5,B000006R0W,Wonderful musical movie.  Only problem was that the DVD stopped once during playing.  I had to hit the play button a couple of times to proceed.,1484870400,,144,4.5
7904818,5,B000006R0W,"Seeing this film from the Israel of the  post-Six-Day War period and then comparing it with the Israel of today shows what amazing progress the country has made in the last four-plus decades. First of take a good look at the views of the Tel Aviv skyline as seen from Yafo (Jaffa) where the story takes place. There is exactly ONE tall building, the Shalom Tower which is 30-some stories tall. Today the Tel Aviv skyline is FILLED with tall building reaching 60 or more stories.
Secondly the poverty seen in the Yafo of the story was all-too realistic and typical of all-too-many so-called ""development towns"" or poor neighborhoods of the Israeli big cities of the  time.  Today, Yafo and those towns have been cleaned up and the general standard of living for everyone, including the lower strata of society has improved immeasurably.  For example, as late as the 1980's it could still take FIVE years to get a telephone installed. Today everyone gets one within a day of moving into a new apartment plus everyone has cellphones as well along with internet. Many Israeli families of the time could not afford to own an automobile. Today, Israel has maybe the highest concentration of cars per kilometer of road and finding a parking place in any city, even at the periphery of the town is a problem.
Thirdly the film has as a main theme the gap between Jews of different ""ethnic"" backgrounds....Jews from Europe (""Ashkenazim"") having a tense relationship with Jews from the Middle East and North Africa (the ""Mizrachim"" or ""Sefardim"") and vice versa. However,  we also see in the film that this was becoming ""politically incorrect"" when Kazablan says to Mr Feldman something to the effec that ""you don't like me because I am Moroccan"" and Feldman replies ""I never said that!"".
Fourthly, the film shows the tense relationship at the time between the public and the government authorities  which was not adequately  responsive to the population which is illustrated in the  song ""Demokratia, Demokratia"" where the people in the neighborhood are sarcastically pointing out how the authorities always had the work ""democracy"" on their lips while having a difficult time dealing with the public in a truly responsive, democratic manner. Today, there has been a great improvement in this reals as more and more Israelis saw how other democratic countries functioned and these ideas were imported into the Israeli body politic.
Of course, the music and dancing in the film are wonderful but one can also get an education on Israeli history and a true appreciation of how this miraculous country in the Middle East has overcome very great obstacles in order to build a successful society, something which, unfortunately, Israel's neighbors have failed to do, and which, in fact, have regressed during the same period of time.",1466467200,,2818,4.955508474576271
7904819,5,B000006R0W,"I saw this movie back in the 70's... dubbed in English (dialogue, songs, everything).... it was amazing! Got the English soundtrack LP... good times!
Too bad I can't find that version anymore... no hablo Hebrew!",1449273600,,211,5.057142857142857
7904820,3,B000006R0W,"Was hoping that this edition was the English version based on the cover, but it isn't.",1431820800,,86,4.4375
7904821,5,B000006R0W,"I saw the movie many years ago when the movie first came out and enjoyed it then and remembered a tune or two from it.  Now, I think, I appreciate it even more for a perfect gem it really is, full of wonderful music, singing and dancing.

The storyline is an Israeli version of Romeo and Juliet, with a happy ending, set in a dilapidated area of Jaffa, at the time when Israel was a land of hope and optimism, despite great poverty and hardships for many of her citizens.

I was amazed how polished the musical numbers were, featuring great voices and great choreography.
My only regret is that I do not know Hebrew and must rely on the subtitles, missing the real dialog and lyrics.",1380240000,,683,4.362204724409449
7904822,5,B000006R0W,"The Israeli ""West Side Story"".  Highly recommended, especially if you love Yehoram Gaon!!!!!  Of course, the costumes, hairdos and costumes are very dates, but music is timeless.",1378684800,,178,5.555555555555555
7904823,5,B000006R0W,"Coming some years after the 1967 war, ""Kazablan"" simultaneously serves as an occasion for mass, critical self-examination by an Israeli society coming to grips with its internal tensions and failures, as well as a vision of the more united society that might emerge in a new, more confident and stable Israel. From sociological and historical perspectives, then, it is fascinating. It also features some classic song and dance numbers and a great love story. The subtitles, while not always perfect, are pretty good. This ""West Side Story"" remake is worth a watch.",1339286400,3,564,5.141304347826087
7904824,5,B000006R0W,"I expected a cozy little provincial version of a folk tale and instead got a full fledged version of an Israeli West Side Story.  The shock was that it was  a terrific musical with great acting direction and wonderful
happy music. It is also a nice love story and has a bit of suspense as well.  The star of the show is Kazablan himself.(Actially, I'm going to see a concert of Yoram Gaon the star,  this week in the U.S.) His wistful version of ""There's a place"" could be an Israeli version of ""Over the Rainbow. The dancing,the musical hits, the star and the director make this show a real classic.  I borrowed the first version and then loved it enough to buy it. Actually I bought it for a good friend as a present as well.  I found it to be a BIG SURPRISE!!",1287532800,,762,4.220689655172414
7904825,5,B000006R0W,"What a wonderful musical/comedy depicting Israeli life in the working class section of Jaffa, a town South of Tel Aviv.  The main character, Kazablan/Simintov, is a Six Day War veteran trying to discover himself.  He engages in harmless mischief with his colorful friends in the process and finally meets the girl of his dreams except that she is Askenazi and he, Sephardic.  Lots of woderful music, dancing, and costumes.",1231632000,4,422,5.086956521739131
