5074057,5,B007BNDET8,Our 19 month old Grandson loves it and is learning so much from this DVD! A plus purchase for these Grandparents! :-),1376006400,,117,4.363636363636363
5074058,5,B007BNDET8,"My son (20 months) absolutely loves cars, so this episode is a winner! I love how they teach safety as well. There is a great song about wearing your seatbelt and it makes getting him buckled up a breeze everytime!",1362787200,,214,4.375
5074059,1,B007BNDET8,"My grandson loves airplanes and he loves Barney.  He was excited when he saw the cover of this one.  Barney wearing flight goggles and flying in an old bi-plane.

Well, hah!  The part of this DVD with anything related to airplanes was a very small segment with a toy airliner plane, and you hardly see the plane.  Mostly it's Barney and the kids and characters dancing around and singing.

And yes, it says planes, trains, and cars in the title, but actually, the only thing there's much about is cars, and there is a lot of unrelated material.  The songs and dialogue are typical Barney show stuff, meaning they put a lot of work into it and it's fine.

But if your little one is into trains or airplanes, skip buying this one.  They'll be disappointed.  If your little one simply likes Barney, or is into cars, this could be a good match for you.

Still...after watching my grandson frustrated and with tears rolling down his cheeks asking for more Barney airplane when the show went on with so much other stuff, I can't give it a better rating.  The planes on the cover isn't in the show at all, either.  What a shame.  A segment with Barney, BJ, and Baby Bop flying those planes and wearing goggles would have been a big hit with a lot of kids.",1361232000,2,1248,4.393013100436681

5074062,5,B007BNDET8,"This is probably my 3 year old favorite Barney DVD because he is all about planes, trains, and cars!  There is a little action and lots of fun, with of course some singing.  It just seems different than the traditional standing around singing Barney DVDs.  There are four episodes, some fun bonus content and a total of over an hour of Barney fun!",1338422400,,347,4.476190476190476

5074087,5,B007BNDET8,"This video explains, in a playful way, about planes, trains and cars.  I like the safety messages included.  Example, when one of the children asked if they could turn knobs in the car Barney explained that children should never touch those things in a real car but because it was a pretend car they could.
