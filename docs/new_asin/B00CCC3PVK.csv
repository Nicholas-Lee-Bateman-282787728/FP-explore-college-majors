8580204,5,B00CCC3PVK,So great! A lot of people said that they couldn't follow the steps. I couldn't at first but each time I worked out to it I got better and better. I like a challenge so wasn't too worried about not being very good right away. It takes time. And you will sweat if you constantly move like Nicole does. Love it!,1447200000,2,308,4.065573770491803
