I absolutely loved this show and how I wish there were more dvd's to purchase of episodes, even the live ones. It is so disappointing that Travel Channel, or BBC, will not release more to the US.",1356480000,,284,4.377358490566038
2819991,4,B000PGTNE8,"Well i happen to love this show for some reason..who knows why?!?  but if you love th show like i do, you'll love revisiting these places.  I have one minor complaint...the way the DVD is set up, when you play the shows in their entirety it stops for commercial breaks...now there are no commercials on the DVD but they put in like these strange intermission breaks?!?!? odd, maybe its a British thing?  but like I said its only a minor annoyance.  Otherwise the collection is great!",1215388800,2,483,4.5813953488372094
2819992,5,B000PGTNE8,"Although similar, but different , from Ghost Hunters, I do reccomend this show. Where as Ghost Hunters applies a more scientific aproach, this show uses a more psychic approach. Yvette Fielding is quite charming as the frightened host, often screaming and running, then scolding herself because she knows she is the one who should pose a brave face. It's neat to hear exactly what is being said here, because on The Travel Channel, they bleep some stuff out which bleeds over the stuff we could hear, and therefore we sometimes lose the meaning. But here, without the bleeps, we can understand better what is occuring.

Ghost Hunters film areas where there aren't humans about ,or leave recorders about, and tend to capture more in manifestations or voices, where as Most Haunted tend to use a psychic, then post notes either proving what the psychic said was accurate, or not. Sometimes Most Haunted captures odd things on voice or film.

Do I like Most Haunted? Yes I do. I think the hostess fits the show perfectly, and shows she is not above being frightened herself. Do I like Ghost Hunters? Yes, I do, and I think thier approach to actually prove something is very worth while.",1208217600,,1183,4.765853658536585
2819993,1,B000PGTNE8,"Just received this DVD and was sorely disappointed.  I guess I've been spoiled by only watching the good ones with David Wells and Ciaran O'Keefe so far.  The THREE episodes on here (yes, only three) all have that over dramatic/over acting Derek A. in them.  In addition, they were not at all scary, nothing substantial happened in any of them, and I actually fell asleep during the last one.  Very sorry I wasted my money on this.  Derek's constant yammering throughout all three episodes gets old fast.  Seriously, the man does not shut up. I recommend season 7 and up only.",1206662400,3,576,4.653465346534653
2819994,1,B000PGTNE8,If you are a most haunted fan as I am and have the complete series collection DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DVD. I thought they were new shows but they are a collection of previous shows. Wasted money and very disppointed :-<,1202860800,8,216,4.2926829268292686

2820047,3,B000PGTNE8,"I enjoy this type of show as much for the history as anything else. Generally I take the investigations with a grain of salt on these things, especially here. Yvette Fielding (the host) can be annoying much of the time. I seriously wanted to reach through the screen more than once and slap her. I've never seen anyone start crying with fear the moment the lights were turned out on one of these things and frankly it distracts to no end when she's on. But Yvette is far better than some of the other ladies (such as Kath) that appear in later seasons. Good grief-- if you're going to be a ghost hunter, get a little backbone. I've never seen a bigger bunch of fraidy cats in my life. I've seen 8 years olds handle spook houses better than some of these folks. The others are much more tolerable. I can handle the dramatics of Deric because he's a medium and its part of his schtick. And David Wells from later seasons is actually quite interesting to watch and has a quiet dignity the others should try to emulate a bit more. He, at least, takes the job seriously.  A couple of the episodes are downright spooky and seem to hint at real possible hauntings-- the Drury Lane Theater comes to mind, among others. There's a bit too much reliance on ""orbs"" that look way too obviously like moths and/or spiders to me. But like I said, I enjoy these shows as a diversion, not for the realness of the ghosts. Still, there's always hope and I admit it is a good way to kill 45 minutes while I unwind from work.",1503014400,5,1503,4.329787234042553
2820048,5,B000PGTNE8,"I watched this show all its episodes,I am a strong believer and I know there are spirits that awAits from thousAnds of years but as in the book of life states it is a shameful to disturb the spirits of the dead.the reads are all around us and waiting for the end of days as to the living will both rise in the end to be judge according to their work. Please read our bible its for us to understand and believe there is GOD.thanks for the show it should give all those are skeptical there is no impossible.

2820049,3,B000PGTNE8,This show wouldn't be so bad if that annoying woman would shut-up and stop acting like she's scared of her shadow. Why have this show if you're so afraid. She makes me sick. I love Deric.,1501718400,,187,4.222222222222222

2820051,2,B000PGTNE8,"This dvd has some mediocre investigations by the ghost team. It certainly isn't Pendle Hill. Derek Acorah is there, but this isn't his famous ""Mary loves Dick"" episode. Slow pacing and night vision throughout, you'd have to be a real fan of the show to not nod off during this set.",1456444800,,281,4.529411764705882

2820053,5,B000PGTNE8,"Outstanding! I used to watch this in the early 2000s when I lived in Northwestern Louisiana. I recently picked this DVD up for cheap, (5 bucks) at a used DVD/Blu-ray store here in S. Ca.
Yvette and the crew do an excellent job all around for the three Castles they research for hauntings.
Although I find her narration and introductions quite good, she is easily scared in most scenarios. I like it for the atmosphere and the settings the most. I am skeptical of Derek however if he is really doing what he says. Seems questionable.
Picture quality and sound are pretty good for this standard DVD and are Widescreen, which is good because unless you are living in the 1990s, we all have Widescreen Hi Def TVs now.

2820055,4,B000PGTNE8,"Most Haunted started the ghost hunting craze in America. They are still better than most of the stuff that is out there now.

8191320,4,B000PGTNE8,"I enjoyed this series when it was on the air, and was very disappointed to find out that Derek was found out to be faking.  The parapsychologist planted ""misinformation"" and Derek fell for it, hook, line and sinker.  The worst part is, it happens in Season 6, and for some reason, Amazon doesn't have this entire season on here?  What happened????",1524960000,,347,4.655737704918033
8191321,5,B000PGTNE8,"One of the earlier haunted location investigations filed in the UK.  US got it and the rest is history.

I have not seen any of these episodes for years (from 2000 or so) and they stand up pretty well with all the series that came after.  The photography is super, and the manor houses, castles, and public buildings are gorgeous and interesting to peek into.  However, like some  other series on haunted locations they really never catch anything (spoiler alert.  But seeing the dungeons etc of these buildings not open to public are fascinating so if you love 13th century cottages, old jails etc, this is well worth watching.

The series works somewhat like the US show, The Dead Files.  Investigators go in ahead of time, look building over, before crew comes on for the investigation.  At this point the psychic (who knows nothing of property)r is allowed in to get impressions (Eric Acorcia in this one, Amy in the DF).  The show then uses the impressions the psychics get to validate the history of the place, psychic sees people dying in river, historian confirm psychic is correct or not.

Kind of an awkward way to prove hauntings and no other shows do it quite this way, which shows off the abilities of the psychics.  Ah, you are thinking, what is to stop the psychics of finding out the info before hand so they can dramatically reveal on camera.  Ya, that does create a lot of questions and viewers have to keep thinking back, did Eric explain who the Robert was he was talking to?  Who was body under floorboards?  Not a real straight forward way to present episodes, which is why shows like Ghost Hunters just investigated and hoped to have a ghost pop out.

But these are fun to watch with such beautiful photography and interesting buildings.  Well worth the price as these episodes have not been shown in US in quite a long time.  Brings back fond memories.",1523836800,,1876,4.61631419939577
8191322,3,B000PGTNE8,"I want to give this show more stars, the team is great, and the show is great, despite Yvette....and Kath...two miserable examples of women in paranormal investigating. It is sad that hysterical screaming women were set as representation of us. I'm pretty sure the only reason that the others will investigate with her is that she's the one who built the team and has a show. Professionals wouldn't deal with that for any other reason. It's embarrassing. Someone who immediately begins clucking, howling and screaming the minute anything they've asked to happen, happens...maybe shouldn't be doing this. Thank the Lord for the supporting team, investigators and psychics seem great.",1522108800,,682,5.26605504587156
8191323,3,B000PGTNE8,"The history and the few professionals Yvette brings onboard are fascinating. But the screaming, the crying, taunting and jump to conclusions just don't do it. There are other paranormal groups out there with respect for spiritual energy and not showmanship. So I give this show 3 Boos.",1520553600,,285,5.085106382978723
8191324,3,B000PGTNE8,"Love learning the history of these places. Patrick and Ciaran seem like their on the up and up and actually trying to understand the hauntings. However, the exaggerated, ear piercing screaming from the ladies is irritating and gives the show a fake feel.",1517443200,,254,4.930232558139535
8191325,4,B000PGTNE8,"I found this on Amazon Prime & was thrilled that there are so many seasons.  Lots of seasons should mean a great show, right?  I'm not sure I'd call it great... yet.  I've seen a definite improvement from season 1 & I'm only on season 3 so there is room for improvement .  My biggest disappointment is the background music!  When everyone yells ""did you hear that""? & they all stop to listen the music continues.  You might be able to hear something but it would be so much better & scarier without the music.  I would still definitely  recommend this as a show to watch.  I'm looking forward to see their progression through the years.",1516147200,,636,4.413793103448276
8191326,4,B000PGTNE8,"Some very good episodes and some duds which is typical of ghost shows. Never know what your going to get, always a question of validity with mediums as some say its faked and some say they really can communicate with the dead. I would say its probably a bit of both since mediums are never guaranteed to communicate one has to figure shows tend to do clever editing when the medium draws a blank. It's a entertaining show regardless and people must make up their own minds about the evidence.",1512000000,,492,4.477777777777778
8191327,4,B000PGTNE8,"I've seen more recent episodes of Most Haunted, and I have to admit, I am hooked.  When I found the earlier episodes on Amazon Prime, I was thrilled.  It's nice to be able to see where Yvette and her team started, and what they have now grown into.  Yes, they were very green when they began.  But it's so fun to see these amazing places with so much history, and to hear about the paranormal goings on that occur there.  Derek is an incredible medium - some of his encounters and possessions are downright frightening.  I have already started in on Season 2, and can't wait to find out what else the team discovers!",1508198400,,616,4.359649122807017
8191328,4,B000PGTNE8,I Lovee this in US. Yvette PLEASE stop screaming.  They will not hurt yoU.  YOU  on the other hand COULD SCARE ANYTHING dead or alive,1505001600,,133,4.24
8191329,3,B000PGTNE8,"I have really enjoyed each season in this series, but not because of the ""ghost"" hunting.  The sites they visit are so interesting and the historical backgrounds are fascinating.  Imagine living in a 900 year old home!  The medium, Derek Acorah, is very believable but the narrator/hostess is a just too hysterical.  All the gasps, screaming and emotional outbursts from her get old really fast.  I have found the best way to watch each episode is to skip over the intro music, watch the introduction and history of the place they visit, listen to Derek Achorah's psychic thoughts on the place and then skip on to the next episode, avoiding the ""ghost hunting"" part where they wander through the establishment in the dark with night vision cameras.  Of course, as with the majority of these types of programs they find nothing except their imaginations running away with them.  Entertaining, though, when there isn't anything else to watch.",1503964800,,940,4.949044585987261
