8456166,3,B0054481QC,"With all due respect, this DVD is okay. Too much talk and too little instructions. Most of these, you can read off the internet. The only thing I learnt that I hadn't read already is to hold your note for at least 16 secs; I will give the entire price of the DVD to this one suggestion. Otherwise, this DVD is not really meant for the western audience  - interspersed with local language and didactic - as we tend to expect precise instructions and less talk. This DVD could have been reduced to 20 minutes or less. Hope this helps!",1416355200,,532,4.32
