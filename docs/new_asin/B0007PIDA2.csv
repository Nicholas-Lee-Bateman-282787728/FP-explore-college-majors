2230288,3,B0007PIDA2,"The Women's Health and Fitness Network marketed the FitPrime series as a fusion workout designed for women over 35. The good points:  The DVD's production values are great: the cueing, music and the set all contribute to a cohesive product.

The not-so-good points:  While the Metaboost workout was definitely a good mix of pilates, cardio, yoga and weights, it wasn't as intense as I expected - and I was using 10 and 15 lb weights already.  The Flex Posture workout was in the same grade, but the modifications demonstrated by the instructor made the exercises easier.  I expected that the instructor would demonstrate the full form and the rest of the exercisers would show different modifications.

I would recommend these workouts for the less-intense periods in a workout cycle.  For more intense weight training, I would recommend Kathy Smith's Lift Weights to Lose Weights Vol. 2.",1111795200,4,888,5.041095890410959
2230289,5,B0007PIDA2,"Women's Health Fitness Network Metaboost is part of the FitPrime series and is described as a fusion workout containing 5 minutes of Pilates, 8 minutes of cardio, 6 minutes of yoga and 30 minutes of weights. The set is gorgeous, the picture and sound quality are flawless, and the colors are beautiful! Heidi Tanner leads, wearing a red top and black pants. She looks as though she never aged from her original Firm days! She sparkles and has a perfect screen presence. She gives excellent form pointers throughout, and modifications are shown in the form of 5 background exercisers shown using household items intermittently.

The warm up is energetic with only a few static stretches. Heidi starts on the floor with core work, using a yoga block held between the knees. Oblique and tranverse abdominals are worked in two exercises, and if you really concentrate on imitating her form and squeezing the block, you will feel it. A modification is shown using a sofa pillow, and I can see using a small medicine ball here as well.

4 limb is next, and this pattern reminds me of the original Firm workouts. Plies with biceps curls, side toe taps with side delt raises and step touch with overhead presses. I used five pounds and the tempo was just right for that. I would consider myself an intermediate/advanced exerciser. The tempo was never too fast, and it varied between slow and fast. I can't say this will elevate your heart rate much if you're a seasoned exerciser, but it's useful for lower weights/higher reps training.

Next are dips using the stick for balance, but you can easily modify this by not using a balance tool and adding ankle weights to increase intensity. Dips are alternated with front sweeps, working the inner thigh. Adding ankle weights will increase this.

Seated shoulder work is next, alternating with rows for the back. She uses a yoga block in your lap to help stabilize, but it's not necessary if you have good balance. It's easy to modify this up just using heavier weights.

Leg press is next on one leg, using a stick and one dumbbell. Again, easy to modify up using two weights and no stick.

Next is 4 limb again, and this one is less intense than the first segment in terms of cardio effect, but again is good for lower weights/higher reps strength training.

The next segment is squats using the step behind as a guide, but it's not necessary. Heidi uses one dumbbell and the stick, and I used two 15# dumbbells and really felt this! You use one leg and there's a balance component involved. Variations in the leg position are used, and I really loved this segment! Triceps push-ups are included here, done on the step, but for more intensity just do them on the floor. Cursy dips return, again on one leg, and if these bother you just do more squats. Because they're done fairly slowly I was able to do them without bothering my knees, holding the two 15# dumbbells.

Next are biceps curls while balancing one foot on the yoga block. It takes a few reps but then you realize how it's also working the core doing them this way. I used two 15# dumbells and I really felt these!

Plies are next with one leg on top of the step. I found these a bit uncomfortable at first, but did them anyway and by the end, I had the balance just right. Heidi uses a stick and one dumbbell - I used a 15# dumbbell and no stick and found the balance challenging without it. She then places the dumbbell on the outer thigh and does leg lifts. Again, I did not use the stick and enjoyed the balance challenge that provided.

The other leg is then worked in the squat sequence, and again the triceps push-ups and cursy dips are included.

Next comes a push-up sequence putting one hand on the yoga block to isolate one side. Both sides are worked, and triceps dips are done in between changing sides.

The other leg is then worked in the plie sequence, and a very nice stretch follows, incorporating yoga moves.

I absolutely loved this workout!! I would give this a solid A, and it's a keeper!!",1111795200,13,4014,4.558333333333334
2230290,2,B0007PIDA2,"I have worked out for many years and used both the old Firm work outs and FitPrime's original workouts.  These two workouts are very easy, and like some of the original FitPrime workouts, a little clumsey. They are ok for the days you don't want to work too hard, but you may have to do both to feel like you've done anything.  In fact I tried to find out if they were designed for older women, but found no information about that.  I am older--past 50  and I found them a yawn.",1111363200,7,478,4.163043478260869
8050224,5,B0007PIDA2,"I've done all the Firms, FitPrimes, and KickButts. I would rate these as low to solid intermediate. FlexPosture is more pilates and floor work, and Metaboost is more of a standard AWT workout like the Firm.

I'm currently in a bad flare of my chronic fatigue syndrome and some days I can barely get off the couch. On those days, these workouts are too hard for me, and I'm lucky to do a Firm Basics or Prime Powers, or one of Anna Benson's Just Right DVDs. But on better days, I can do half of one of these without getting my HR too high. This time last year, I could do the whole workout with no problem, and I hope to get back there.

I love the functional fitness and all the stretching you find in FitPrime and KickButt. When I stick to the Firm, I find I am tighter and more sore. These keep me loose and help me work on my balance.

I owe Anna Benson, the creator of the Firm and Fitprime, a huge debt of gratitude. It seems she made a workout for every level I've found myself at.",1516233600,,987,4.103626943005182
8050225,5,B0007PIDA2,"These are two very good workouts.  The instructors are good, and the workouts cross-train nicely with one another.  The set is beautiful and the music is modern.  I love the fusion of weights, pilates and yoga.  You do need weights, a tall box, a dowel and dumb bells, but household items can be substituted -- no excuses then!  And if you have done the Firm since the beginning, like me, all the equipment is standard Firm.  It can be easily made harder as other reviewers have said with ankle weights, heavier dumb bells and weighted dowels.  This still has the old ""Firm"" feel with a modern, beautiful set and updated music.  I have just come off an injury and this workout is great, as all the Fitprime's are, for getting back in shape.  I have the Kickbutt series, too, but as I am just starting out, they are too advanced for me at this time...but they are very good workouts, too.",1339891200,4,887,4.459627329192546
8050226,5,B0007PIDA2,"After two years of little exercise (due to devoting all my spare time to my newly published book), I knew it was time to begin working out again.  My 16 year old son bought P90-X, and I decided I could start by working out with him.  He tried to show me how to do a pull up.  Let me give you a visual here.  I am the ""healthier""???? pear shape, making me a little harder to pull up.  These weak little arms just couldn't quite get the butt high enough.  Get the picture?  P90-X didn't work for me.

For many years I had been a devoted Firm fan, so I checked around and found FitPrime, designed for those over 35, but quite fitting for a 57 year old a little lacking in cardiovascular fitness and strength.  I am happy for all of you who said this wasn't enough of a workout for you.  For me, however, the first time I did Metaboost, I had to stop to gasp for air and wipe off the sweat which was dripping off my brow right into my contacts.  So for any of you who are so sadly out of shape as I was, Metaboost is for you.  Just today I completed my eighth workout and I feel great!  I can complete the entire workout without stopping, I've already moved up to heavier weights, and best of all I can already see a difference.  On my off days, I'm going for lengthy walks, since this is our nice time of year.  In the winter, I'll stay inside and alternate dvds.

I love cooking and eating well, but that by itself is not enough to stay healthy.  Unless you're in the middle of finishing a book, get moving!  Your body will thank you later.

8050227,5,B0007PIDA2,"This DVD was an impulse purchase for me and I was hooked the first time I did it. I could not finish the Metaboost workout the first time I did it and I was in pretty good shape. It totally kicked my butt. Heidi leads this workout and is easy to follow. There is an interesting mix of weights, use of the stool, and the stick - if you don't have the sports equipment, you can use household items, as they demonstrate. Recently, I hurt my knee and shoulder and have been using the Flex Posture workout. It is also awesome! It can be as intense as you make it but you will walk away feeling comfortably stretched and relaxed. I loved this DVD so much I went to their website and order the entire series. I have not  been disappointed with any of the workouts. There is a great variety for however you might be feeling on any given day. And I am never bored.",1197849600,5,855,4.150602409638554
8050228,5,B0007PIDA2,"If you are a fan of the Firm series, you'll like this too because it's the same creaters.  They have made another great workout.  There are two aerobic/toning routines that are fresh and exciting (you don't repeat the same moves so it keeps interest level up).

Metaboost is the more intense routine (they are litteraly helping you boost your metabolism) and in that segment, you use weights within the aerobic part to increase it's effectiveness.  Flex Posture is a barefoot routine that uses both pilates and yoga for flexibility.

You will need a couple of items to help you in this workout (their fanny lifter, a foam block and your dumbells), but this is a good routine that does actually get results if you do them often enough.  I like this and based on this program, I'd buy more dvds from them.  Very happy with this.",1157328000,3,826,4.616438356164384
8050229,3,B0007PIDA2,"I have been using the Firm since 1988.  I still use volumes 1, 2 and 3.  Very effective, but my body is very use to the routines.  I figured this would be a good change and hopefully bump up results.  The DVD's are sloooowww[...]  You bearly work up a sweat.  One of the moves on Flexposture is power sitting!?!?! Come on...I don't have time to waste sitting, I do that all day at work.  The DVD's well made and thought out, just not for me.",1142467200,3,441,4.117647058823529
8050230,3,B0007PIDA2,"Since Carol has already broken this workout down in detail, I'll just offer my impressions.  I was excited to try this workout given that I really like the older FitPrimes (including one led by the instructor here, Heidi Tanner) as well as the one other WHFN workout that I tried.  Unfortunately, I was quite disappointed in this workout.  On the one hand, it had many good points, but on the other, it seemed that each good point had an accompanying down side.  Here are my thoughts:

*The warm-up was nice, although inexplicably labeled as ""cardio"" on the menu--it never really got to that level.  I also did enjoy the stretch which concludes the workout.

*The aerobic effect of this workout was quite minimal.  The two 4-limb cardio segments (8 minutes total) were fun but not very intense; the second one in particular had some unique moves but was performed way too slowly for any aerobic benefit.

*After the warm-up, you immediately go to the floor for core work, and I wasn't crazy about that sequencing.  I also wasn't quite sure if I was correctly incorporating the yoga block into the moves--Heidi does not spend much time discussing form--and I felt the work in different places than where Heidi said I should be feeling it.

*I was really confused about what weights to use throughout the workout.  Heidi sometimes says ""heavy"" or ""light,"" but she never tells you what she's using, which would have been helpful.  There were times when I would have liked to go heavier with my weights, but the flow of the exercises made this difficult to do, and thus I often felt as if I wasn't working very hard.

*Although I love using the tall step and didn't mind adding the yoga block and the stick, overall, the use of equipment in this workout felt awkward to me.

*Finally, although I like Heidi, I really wish she had provided more details about form, especially for some of the more unique moves.  For example, I liked the idea of doing a plie squat with one foot on the step, but I just couldn't find a position where it felt right, and Heidi didn't say anything that helped.

Overall, I didn't much enjoy this workout while doing it, and I didn't feel adequately worked out once it was over, which was especially disappointing given the length (49 minutes).  Although there might be a ""learning curve"" to getting the hang of the exercises--and I could certainly envision how the moves might be effective--I just don't think I'll feel motivated to do this workout again.",1140739200,2,2480,4.675115207373272
8050231,5,B0007PIDA2,"I've been a ""Firmie"" for over 12 years and I was really upset when the Firm split.  I was disappointed in both the ""new"" Firm and the orginal Fit Prime.  I was also getting older and finding that the ""old""  Firms were just way too tough on my joints.

Enter Anna with her new Fit Prime series...if you are in shape it keeps you in shape, and if you are not, it will get you there.  I'm 57 and am really enjoying the benefits of the whole new series..I have all 6 of them.  They are just tough enough and are very gentle on my joints.  The Flex Posture tape will be misunderstood by many unless you are of a certain age when flexibility becomes a concern.

OK, Anna says that this set is specifically designed for the woman over 35, but in all reality, I think it would be better to say over 45 and closer to 50.  However, if you are a true beginner or intermediate, these would be very appropriate.

Thanks again Anna, for giving us older gals a great way to stay Firm and Fit!",1120003200,24,977,4.121693121693122
8050232,4,B0007PIDA2,"When I first tried Metaboost I HATED it and wrote a scathing review here-which I later deleted! I hung onto this DVD and gave it another chance. Now that I've increased the weights for this, it always has a place in my rotation. When Heidi does the first set of dips using no weights, I use a 15 lb. dumbell. For the leg presses and squats I use 15 lb. in each hand and for the one legged plies on the bench I use 20 lbs. on the tie-in of the working leg and 20 lbs on the opposite shoulder. For the hip rotation I use 20 lbs. on the working leg. This gives me a great workout-I'm working hard enough that my heart rate's up there and I feel I've worked everything. That's what I love about the Firm-I even keep some of the basic tapes for when I'm not feeling up to the ""gut-busting cardio"". I can use heavier weights & light weights for the cardio when they use none and I always feel I've gotten a decent workout. You might try it!",1114732800,7,934,4.054054054054054
8050233,3,B0007PIDA2,"Slow and deliberate.  Those are the two words I most apply to this workout.  The tempo lets you really work a move. And, for such a deliberate pace you really work up a sweat.
I found the clams and the one leg plies with balance option particularly tough.  These two moves are something that you can really make it your goal to conquer.
The set is visually stimulating and the music really works well with the moves.
I give this workout a B+.

FlexPosture - Tackling the Third Component of Fitness
Stretching which increases flexibility is the most neglected component of Fitness.
This workout admirably tackles this issue.
Do not expect a heart thumping aerobic workout. You will not get it here.  What you will get is your muscles work in a different way, a less impacted way.
For those of you who care about increasing your flexibility and strength through none impacted ways (Pilates and Yoga), this is an excellent workout.  I give it an A.
