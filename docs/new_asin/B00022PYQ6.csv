2056738,5,B00022PYQ6,"Really enjoyed the Good Old Dick Van Dyke show, saw some I'd never seen before.",1129334400,2,79,4.333333333333333
2056739,5,B00022PYQ6,"This VHS tape contains two half-hour episodes of ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" -- two shows in the proverbial ""public domain"" batch of Season-Two episodes of the black-and-white 1960s sitcom, starring Dick Van Dyke and Mary Tyler Moore.

The episodes:

1.) ""Hustling The Hustler"";

-- and: --

2.) ""The Night The Roof Fell In"".

The official titles of each of these episodes are both printed incorrectly on the front cover of this VHS videocassette. Not huge errors, but errors nonetheless. And knowing how much of a perfectionist Robert S. Petrie is when it comes to the scripts he turns in for Alan Brady's stamp of approval, I feel it's my civic duty to serve as the ""D.V.D. Show Police"" when it comes to pointing out such mistakes on the packaging of any and all video/media items. Such minor titling gaffes don't help the reputation of the video outfits producing these public-domain releases, but such goofs won't make the shows any less funny (that's a certainty). :-)

""Hustling The Hustler"" first aired on CBS-TV on Wednesday night, October 24, 1962, right smack-dab in the middle of one of the most frightening events in the history of the United States -- that being the two-week-long ""Cuban Missile Crisis"" -- which was resolved just four days later, on October 28th (to the collective relief of the entire U.S. population).

""Hustler"" was the thirty-fifth ""Dick Van Dyke Show"" episode ever filmed (or aired) in the history of the five-year TV series, and was the 5th show aired during the second year ('62-'63) of the CBS comedy program, which co-starred Morey Amsterdam as ""Buddy Sorrell"". Buddy plays a major part in the ""Hustler"" episode .... as does Buddy's brother (""Blackie""), played by Phil Leeds. ""Hustler"" was filmed in front a live audience on September 4, 1962.

It's the only episode in the series where we see Buddy's brother, who, as it turns out, is revealed to be a millionaire by episode's end (by marriage that is; he married a woman who's loaded). But prior to ""going straight"" in his life, Blackie was a pool hustler, which is the central theme of ""Hustling The Hustler"".

Not only is ""Hustler"" the only Van Dyke Show in which we see Buddy Sorrell's brother, it is also the only episode in which we get a glimpse of the Petrie basement and pool table -- except for the episode ""Your Home Sweet Home Is My Home"", during Season Four, when we see a totally different-looking basement before the Petries moved into their house on Bonnie Meadow Road (which came complete with an enormous rock, which supposedly was preventing Rob from placing a pool table down there). But, don't let that little continuity error by writer/producer Carl Reiner keep you from enjoying ""Hustler"". It's not one of my all-time overall favorites of the series, but a solid entry anyway.

Part of the reason that the ""Hustler"" episode doesn't rank higher on my ""fave"" meter is due to the obvious contrivances in the script. It's fairly plain that the pool table was ""inserted"" into the Petrie basement for the sole purpose of this one particular episode (although Rob, in one other episode, does mention ""playing pool"" during a phone call to neighbor ""Jerry Helper"", but we don't actually see the table in that show).

The ""Hustler"" script is a little too ""pat"", so to speak, which is not the norm for a Van Dyke Show script. But even with the obvious ""pool table contrivance"", it's still a fun way to spend approx. 25 minutes.

The second episode on board this videocassette is the 2nd-season entry ""The Night The Roof Fell In"" (aired on Wednesday, November 21st, 1962, the day before Thanksgiving that year). That ep. was #39 in the series' history (it was filmed on October 9 of '62).

""Roof"" is a true gem of an episode, with the entire cast shining brightly. Rob and Laura have a spat, with Rob storming out of the house in a huff. Afterwards, via flashbacks (a common tool utilized by Mr. Reiner throughout the five-year lifetime of this TV series), Rob and Laura tell very differing versions of the fight the couple had the night before. These exaggerated ""re-tellings"" of the battle that took place are the heart of the episode (and push this program into official ""very funny"" territory). .... ""Why don't you fix yourself up?!"" .... ""What is the use of having a kid around the house if he can't be cute?!"" ~LOL!~

Similar to my ""contrived"" commentary regarding the ""Hustler"" episode, I guess if I wanted to nitpick the ""Roof"" show to death, I could talk about a bit of a contrivance during this show too -- that being: the fish tank that we see at the beginning of ""The Night The Roof Fell In"" -- which is a fish-housing item that we never see again during the whole series. It was obviously placed into this show to ""introduce"" the audience to the plot of this episode (with talking fish even!). I think, however, instead of griping about the implausibilities of ""talking fishies"" and the one-time-seen tank/aquarium, I would rather praise the insertion of such devices here. I think it was rather cute, and a clever way for Carl Reiner to lay out the episode's plotline without having to rely on actual characters to tell us what just occurred.

So .... Pop in this videotape and enjoy a ""Hustler"" at work and watch the ""Roof"" fall in on Rob and Laura. (But always remember to call the wife first before bringing home a bagful of Moo Goo Gai Pan.) .... ""Rob, won't you ever learn?!!""

2056742,5,B00022PYQ6,"My first crush on a television actress was on Mary Tyler Moore as Laura Petrie on ""The Dick Van Dyke Show,"" so of course the famous episode where she gets her toe caught in the faucet of a bathtub (while playing with the drip) is bound to be a favorite.  Therefore, I announce with great joy that you will find that classic episode here on ""The Best of 'The Dick Van Dyke Show,' Volume 3.""  The other three episodes include one more classic, one fun episode, and one that must suffer in comparison to another classic episode.  Speaking of comparisons on the topic of Mary Tyler Moore in a bathtub, that reminds me of the great episode of her own show, ""Mary's Insomnia,"" that shows us how funny it is to be on the same side of the bathroom door as her character when she is bathing (that episode, which dealt with Mary's dependence on sleeping pills, also had a strong dramatic side as well).  Now, onto our four featured episodes:

Episode 124, ""100 Terrible Hours"" (Written by Bill Persky & Sam Denoff, First aired Mary 5, 1965) is another great flashback episode where Rob recalls the time he was on the air broadcasting his radio show for 100 hours straight.  Then he goes straight into his first meeting with Alan Brady about becoming a writer for ""The Alan Brady Show.""  There is fun to be had with Laura trying to keep Rob awake, but my favorite part is when Rob reaches an emotional breaking point over the fate of a poor little cat stuck in a tree.

Episode 129, ""Uhny Uftz"" (Written by Carl Kleinschmitt & Dale McRaven, First aired September 29, 1965) is the time when Rob said he say a flying saucer hovering outside the office window one night when he, Buddy and Sally are working late one night at the office.  Okay, but this one makes you think of the classic ""It May Look Like a Walnut,"" so it has to suffer in comparison.

Episode 121, ""Never Bathe On Saturday"" (Written by Carl Reiner, First aired March 31, 1965) proves once again how far you can take a simple idea and turn it into comedy gold as Rob tells the story of when the Petries went on their second honeymoon and Laura got her toe stuck in the water spout of a bathtub in a fancy hotel.  The problem is that the bathroom door is locked from the inside.  Then there is that mustache Rob has drawn on his upper lip and the suspicious hotel security guy.  Reiner's script was nominated for an Emmy, as should any script that has you thinking Laura is nude (""see"" also, ""October Eve"").  This episode features familiar faces Kathleeen Freeman as the maid, Bernard Fox as the detective, as Arthur Malet as the engineer.

Episode 40, ""The Secret Life Of Buddy And Sally"" (Written by Lee Erwin, First aired November 28, 1962), has Rob suspicious when Buddy and Sally start acting strangely.  He becomes convinced they must be writing for another show because the obvious alternative is worse.  But it turns out they are doing a comedy act (as Gilbert and Solomon).  This episode reminds me of the ""I Love Lucy"" show when everybody would get into the act.  Buddy tells jokes while ""playing"" the cello, Sally sings ""Come Rain or Come Shine,"" and Rob and Laura join in as Lester and Esther Bushwhacker to do a song and dance number as well.  As you would expect this is a fun episode.",1123977600,14,3251,4.45945945945946
2056743,5,B00022PYQ6,"""The Best of 'The Dick Van Dyke Show,' Volume 2"" has the distinction of having three of the Dick Van Dyke's five favorite episodes (he lists the first three below plus #93 ""I'd Rather Be Bald Than Have No Head at All"" and #121 ""Never Bathe on Saturday"").  That alone is going to justify a five star rating for this DVD, but let us recall the episodes just to prove the point for the record:

Episode 19, ""Where Did I Come From?"" (Written by Carl Reiner, First aired January 3, 1962), has Rob explaining to young Ritchie the story of his birth in response to the question that serves as the title for the episode.  Apparently the last days of Laura's pregnancy got a bit exciting, which explains why she ended up arriving at the hospital in a laundry truck.  The punch line for the show is a bit lame, but the rest of it is pretty good slapstick, which definitely plays to the strength of the Dick Van Dyke..

Episode 51, ""It May Look Like a Walnut!"" (Written by Carl Reiner, First aired February 6, 1963) is the famous episode where Rob makes the mistake of watching a thriller on the late show.  The next thing we know he is having a nightmare about an alien named Twilo-ite (Danny Thomas) who plans to take over the world.  This is the one where Laura has eyes in the back of her head and rides out of the closet on a sea of walnuts.  Is this a great episode or what?  It is usually considered the most popular ""DVDS"" episode, but the next one is usually named as the best.

Episode 64, ""That's My Boy"" (Written by Bill Persky and Sam Denoff, First aired September 25, 1963) is the legendary episode which most people agree had the longest laugh by the studio audience in the history of ""The Dick Van Dyke Show.""  The story is another flashback that tells about what happened when they brought Ritchie home from the hospital and Rob becomes convinced they have brought home the wrong baby.  To straighten out the situation he invites over the other couple, the Peters (Greg Morris and Mimi Dillard) so they can switch the babies back.  But as soon as Rob opens the door, he realizes he has made a really big mistake.  Hard to believe that this was Persky and Denoff's first script for the show, but they were hired by Reiner as full-time writers because of this one.  Of course, it was all down hill for them from here, but what a way to start.

Episode 90, ""October Eve"" (Written by Bill Persky and Sam Denoff, First aired April 8, 1964) tells the story of how, once upon a time, Laura posed for a painting for Rob by the young Greenwich Village artist, Serge Carpetna (Carl Reiner).  Although Laura posed fully clothed, Carpenta painted her nude, so Laura refused to accept the painting.  But now Carpenta is a famous artist and the painting has resurfaced and you can imagine what happens when Rob sees it (one person claims the laughter from the studio audience lasted even longer than the legendary laugh of the previous episode).  How much would you give to actually see the painting?  Especially if you have been waiting four decades like some of us.

Random Thought:  I know that the long laugh in ""That's My Boy"" was edited down when the show aired, but I wonder how it stacks up against the other classic eruption of studio audience laughter in television history.  That would be the infamous Ed Ames tomahawk toss on ""The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson.""  Fortunately you are talking about a great set up and payoff in the one case and a totally spontaneous and unplanned event in the other, so they can each win their own category.",1123545600,15,3546,4.462015503875969
2056744,5,B00022PYQ6,"This second volume in Image Entertainment's ""Best Of"" series of DVDs serves up four more memorable episodes from one of the greatest TV shows of all-time: ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"".
Watch the following four eps. in glorious restored and re-mastered Digital clarity ..........
1.) ""Where Did I Come From?"" (From Season 1; Air Date: 01/03/1962).
2.) ""That's My Boy??"" (From Season 3; Air Date: 09/25/1963).
3.) ""It May Look Like A Walnut"" (From Season 2; Air Date: 02/06/1963).
4.) ""October Eve"" (From Season 3; Air Date: 04/08/1964).
--------------------------
These four episodes are, without fear of (much) argument, four of the all-time best that this great 1960s TV series has to offer.  Each one resides in the ""classic"" drawer, IMO.
Image has even seen fit to include some bonus material here, which consists of:  An Emmy Awards video clip; cast interview snippets; a 23-minute ""Making Of"" featurette focusing on the ""Walnut"" episode; a ""Meet The Cast"" section (which consists of text-only ""mini-bios"" for the cast members); and a cute extra called ""The Ottoman Tripper"", which is a 1-question trivia game. If you select the wrong answer to the question, you're taken to a film clip from the opening titles of the show where Rob trips over the living-room ottoman.  A correct guess affords you a clip of Rob sidestepping the ottoman.  A ""Play All"" option is also included.
NOTE:  On Image's season boxed sets, three of these four episodes have Audio Commentary Tracks (all except the ""Walnut"" ep.).  However, those star commentaries have *not* been included for this single-disc version of these episodes.  So, if you want to hear any Commentary Tracks, you'll have to get the full-season sets.
Video quality is outstanding for these shows, with the Dolby Digital sound garnering equal praise.

It's oh so very hard to pick a ""Best"" among these excellent ""Best Of"" volumes that Image Entertainment has released for fans of the show who want to collect just *some* of the great shows from Dick Van Dyke's series.  But if I were *forced* (at gunpoint) to choose just one of the five discs to buy, I might just have to go with this ""Volume #2"".  Four LOL-inducing episodes, all with a high re-watchability factor built into each one.  You can't go wrong when you select any of the shows on this DVD!",1089331200,21,2521,4.9245283018867925
2056745,5,B00022PYQ6,"Volume #3 in Image's ""The Best Of The Dick Van Dyke Show"" series of five single-disc DVDs digitally dishes up four more hilarious offerings from this landmark TV sitcom, which ran on CBS from 1961 to 1966.

Here's this volume's list of programs (with air-date information) ..........
1.) ""One Hundred Terrible Hours"" (From Season 4; Air Date: 05/05/1965).

A nice, funny assortment of Van Dyke Show entries indeed.  These value-priced 4-episode ""Best Of"" discs are great for the Dick Van Dyke fan who doesn't want to necessarily collect *every* single episode via the also-available complete-season compilations offered through Image Entertainment.
These ""Best Of"" DVDs also contain some supplemental material, which is a pleasant surprise.  Some interview footage is included here, as well as a short clip from another TV series starring Dick Van Dyke, ""Diagnosis Murder"", which has a ""Van Dyke Show"" tie-in.
Two additional ""mini"" extras on the disc are: ""Meet The Cast"" (text-only ""biography"" feature) and ""The Ottoman Tripper"" (trivia game).

If you get all 5 ""Best Of"" volumes, you'll have 20 of the finest sitcom episodes ever made.

2056754,5,B00022PYQ6,"This DVD offers a quartet of episodes from the second season of the classic television situation comedy ""The Dick Van Dyke Show."" If there is a common denominator to them, it would be that they all focusing on the domestic bliss of the Petries in New Rochelle rather than on writing for ""The Alan Brady Show.""  Usually by this point in a collection of ""best"" episodes things start to get thin, but that is hardly the case here.  Also of interest, see if you can figure out which episode was written by the grandfather of the guy who created ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer.""  Taken collectively, these classic episodes will explain why it might have been ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" that was finishing #1 in the Nielsens, but this was the sitcom that was picking up the Emmys for Best Comedy during that period:

Episode 53, ""Give Me Your Walls!"" (Written by Carl Reiner, February 27, 1963) has Laura hiring a flamboyant artist Vito Giotto (Vito Scotti) to paint the living room walls after Rob accidentally draws a horse on it (really). However, Vito loves his work--and their walls--way too much.  He plans on taking five days to paint the walls, even when he likes to get started at 5:30 in the morning.  So Rob and Laura would like to get rid of him, but without hurting Vito's feelings.

Episode 39,  ""The Night the Roof Fell In"" (Written by John Whedon, November 21, 1962) which does the ""Rashomon"" bit as Rob (Dick Van Dyke) and Laura (Mary Tyler Moore) tell their own completely different versions of the fight that ended up with Rob storming out of the house.  Everything starts when things do not go well at work where a script needs to be rewritten, but by the time Laura is trying to explain to Millie what is going on, her next door neighbor is thoroughly confused.

Episode 43,  ""A Man's Teeth Are Not His Own"" (Written by Carl Reiner, December 19, 1962) has Rob completely convinced that Jerry (Jerry Paris) will never forgive him after he had another dentist do emergency work on his teeth. A simple idea, but nobody does guilt as well as Dick Van Dyke (except maybe Mary Tyler Moore), and it does get pretty funny as Dick tries to hide his teeth.  There is also a nice payoff to this one when Rob is finally forced to confess the truth.

Episode 31, ""Never Name a Duck"" (Written by Carl Reiner, September 26, 1962), has Rob making the mistake of taking a pair of baby ducks home after the show.  Laura does not want to see them because she would only end up falling in love with them, but then Richie (Larry Mathews) goes ahead and names them (Oliver and Stanley).  Stanley gets sick and Rob takes him to vet, but it is too late.  So Rob comes up with a story about how Stanley went back to the lake and met Olivia.  But the story does not really fly with Ritchie.

""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" benefited from pretty good writing and even better performances as this collection proves. Reiner had been a performer on ""Your Show of Shows"" and had originally crafted the show (called ""Head of the Family"" in the first pilot) around himself as the star. The first season of the show was the weakest because Reiner took a while to learn how to write for Van Dyke rather than for himself, which he certainly succeeded in doing as the middle of these three episodes proves. This helps to explain why the second season was such a big improvement (and went from 80th place to 9th in the ratings)",1151193600,3,3392,4.487804878048781
