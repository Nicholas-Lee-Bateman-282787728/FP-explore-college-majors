8435259,4,B004LXBKCY,"I felt obliged to write this to offset the other 1 star review. First, this was a sensational match.....and a huge one for Novak.  The presentation is spread over two DVDs and the picture is widescreen and just fine.  The question of edits comes into play in that they do not present all the jibberish between games and sets and such as some DVDs do.  Maybe you like that?  I don't care to have to watch players toweling themselves off , drinking water, listening to the commentators fill air space... so I like that this is just the tennis and the extra filler  is edited out. This program begins with the first serve and the action is intense for the 3 hours plus...  If you want to watch two of the games best go toe to toe..... you get it.",1413936000,,743,4.271428571428571
