8019425,5,B00020FTO0,"You gotta love a movie that starts off with an open credits song blatantly ripping off Janet Jackson's ""Nasty Girl""  Written by Richard Pryors crazy wife, Flynn Belaine Pryor. He married this woman not once,but twice. I get the impression Pryor was pressured by his wife to appear in this film. Made on a very modest budget.
The great Renaldo Rey appears as King Alberto Nacho. This film is just a little oddity with the freakin' legend,Richard Pryor. Very much worthwhile to see, if only for Mr. Pryor,and the laughs. Expect lots of Kid' n Play flat tops",1523664000,,555,4.663265306122449
8019426,2,B00020FTO0,Rifftrax / MST3K material! The history of this film is more interesting. Suggest people read Richard Pryor's Biography for more background to what lead to the production of the film. Pryor has a cameo with the main character who was his old lady. Richard Pryor was a genius though this film may not reflect it.,1516838400,,310,4.654545454545454

8019429,2,B00020FTO0,Not a very good film.  Acting was to-do but the writing and plot were very poor.  I was curious but I should have guessed the movie would be poor.,1388707200,2,146,4.0
8019430,3,B00020FTO0,"""The Three Muscatels""

It was what I expected of the movie The Three Muscatels. Purchased to add to my Richard Pryor collection. Thank you.",1358294400,3,139,4.791666666666667
