2696376,4,B000KN7BLI,"'Eating Out 2: Sloppy Seconds' is a sequel that is not really a sequel - unless the common thread of social attitudes and gender dilemmas as an ongoing tale is the source. A low budget, well scripted, tightly directed (Phillip J. Bartell) little film about gay relationships, attraction blunders, and pretending to be something we aren't (mixed representations that Shakespeare used a lot!) result in a light and ultimately charming little movie.

Kyle (Jim Verraros) loves Marc (Brett Chukerman) but tires of Marc's obsession with one-night stands and the relationship is 'over'. Pining Kyle is supported by his two loony girl friends Tiffani (Rebekah Kochan) and Gwen (Emily Brooke Hands), each with gender attraction problems of her own. In an art class taught by flamboyant pseudo-straight Neil (Michael Serrato) the three meet the new nude model Troy (superstud Marco Dapper) and together they hatch a plan to repair Kyle's old damage: Troy for all his demeanor is a bisexual who wants to be straight.... maybe and supplies the key to a game of deceit. The manner in which Kyle fakes a relationship with Tiffani in order to convince Troy to join him in a 'change-over program' (read, get close to him...) leads to a series of hilarious 'go straight' classes and confrontation with parents who play both sides of the 'support our sons' game and leads to a perky ending that just happens to make some comments on perceptions of people, with reality winning.

The cast is young (with the exception of Mink Stole and Sarah Lilly, both of whom offer solid professional backgrounds to their roles) and attractive and seems to be having a great time pulling off this light farce. There is plenty of spectacular eye candy (Marco Dapper, Brett Chukerman, Nicholas James, Adrian Quinonez, James Michael Bobby, etc) and the women's roles are kept light and genuine. A great movie it is not, but a fun diversion it most assuredly is. Grady Harp, June 07",1181088000,10,1946,4.929878048780488
2696377,4,B000KN7BLI,"Kyle recently broke up with his boyfriend Mark, and is whining about it to his best friends/fag hags, Tiffani and Gwen, when he gets a pleasant surprise in their college art class:  a jaw-droppingly gorgeous nude male model named Troy.  Troy is also a student at the college, and admits he has had some same-sex experiences, but feels they were wrong and that he needs to find a ""best buddy"" who can help him go straight. Kyle pretends to be a ""reformed"" homosexual himself, in order to get close to Troy, and accompanies him to a meeting of the school's ""ex-gay"" support group. Meanwhile, Mark sees Kyle with Troy and gets jealous, and tries to get close to Troy himself.  In the end, everyone bands together to expose (literally) the hypocritical leader of the ex-gay group.

""Eating Out 2: Sloppy Seconds"" (2006) is the supposed sequel to 2004's original ""Eating Out"" film, and has characters and actors (with the exception of Ryan ""Desperate Housewives"" Carnes, who was replaced by Brett Chuckerman in the role of Mark), although it is actually a stand-alone story that doesn't require familiarity with the first film.  The actors (especially former ""America Idol"" contender Jim Verranos as Kyle) seem to be more comfortable in their roles this time around, newcomer Marco Dapper (as Troy) shows significant acting ability, and there are more funny scenes than cringe-inducing ones this time around. The film is also improved by the casting of Mink Stole as Kyle's mom, Adrian Quinonez (from Here! TV's ""Dante;s Cove"") as one of the (not-so)ex-gays, and Michael Serrato (from Logo's ""Big Gay Sketch Show"") as a flamboyant art teacher.  Besides the hypocrisy of many in the ex-gay movement, the story also tries to teach lessons on parental acceptance and trust in a relationship, but it really doesn't register on that level.  DVD includes ""making of"" featurette and director commentary.

Don't expect great filmmaking; it's obviously a low-budget farce, and works well on that level.  Based strictly on the story and direction, I'd give it only three stars, but it gets an extra star for being great fun and providing some dazzling eye candy!",1180483200,38,2147,4.9748603351955305

2696380,5,B000KN7BLI,"The Eating Out movies are silly and unbelievable.  A straight guy lets a gay man please him orally as long as he listens to a woman on the phone talking dirty to him?  Please.  The entire series is far-fetched and the creators intended them that way.  But there is much hilarity in these films--especially this one--the second in the series.  Rebekah Kochon appears in all five movies, but the last two only feature her in a brief scene.  In this movie, she is absolutely hilarious!  She literally steals the show--so much so that she received head billing in the next (third) one.  (And she was very funny in the third movie, but her best performance is in this one.)  A nonsensical plot, many sexy guys, and a hilarious woman are what you have here.  If that appeals to you, then check it out.  Side note:  the first movie featured Ryan Carnes from ""Desperate Housewives"", but he declined to do any further movies in the series.  Enter Brett Chukerman in the same role in this movie.  Brett is very sexy and he actually is probably the best actor in this film.  You may know him now as one of the Hosts on Home Shopping Channel (HSN).  I guess he's still ""acting"", but selling products at the same time.",1483833600,,1205,4.483870967741935

2696466,5,B000KN7BLI,"I saw this sequel before watching the first Eating Out. Glad I did. This is my favorite film of the trilogy. The first film was so sloppy and amateurish it seemed like a warm up to this superior sequel. Eating Out 2: Sloppy Seconds is much wittier than numero uno. The characters got on your nerves the first go-around. Here the ""cartoonish"" nature of the characters softens them, and makes them more agreeable. Also, the comic timing of the actors is much better directed and played.

The ex-gay subplot is hysterical, and nicely counter balances the sexual obsession of the main characters for Marco Dapper's hunk. And as hunks go, Mr. Dapper is King of the Hill, or hills, from the backside. See the movie, you'll get it. If I have a main complaint it's that all three Eating Out movies feature the gym bunny porno standards that are unfortunately the norm for gay independent features now. None of the pretty boys has a single hair on their chests. Uh, MOST men DO have hair there.

Mr. Dapper, however, transcends any standard of male beauty. He is physically so perfect he'll haunt your retina days after you've seen the film. He looks like a Greek statue come to life. His earnest delivery, soft low voice, and erotic ease in the bisexual shenanigans make him as ideal for this type of sex comedy as Jane Fonda was/is in Barbarella. Mr. Dapper's character is every bit as fanciful and entertaining as Ms. Fonda's futuristic astronaut. Bon appetit!",1279065600,,1454,4.698039215686275
2696467,5,B000KN7BLI,"I love all 3 (so far) Eating Out films. This one is my favorite. It's very funny and light hearted. It's also very hot. It's got a good cast, some terrific jokes and a lot of heart. That sounds cliche' but it's true. Just a very fun film. The fact that it's plain fun is it's greatest aspect.

2696473,4,B000KN7BLI,"A friend introduced me to the first Eating Out film a few years ago and I embraced it, although not as much as he did.  I liked the film, but it wasn't up to par even by independent-gay-comedy standards.  I enjoyed it enough, but when I saw that there was a sequel available I was pretty sure it was just cashing in on the first film's success and would be even worse.  By my calculations, this would should have been a terrible film.

I won't go into total detail with the plot, although it is as crazy as the first film.  Kyle and Marc are breaking up.  New guy Troy (a nude model for Kyle's art class) isn't sure what orientation he is.  Returning from the first film, Tiffani and Gwen convince Kyle he should pretend to be an ex-gay to get Marc in the sack.  He goes along with the plot, no matter how unsure, and hilarity ensues.  What is better here, though, is the filmmakers have a better hold on what is happening on-screen.

I was completely surprised that almost immediately I started cracking up.  This is the Empire Strikes Back, Aliens, or Godfather 2 of gay comedies.  The script is better, the acting is more confident and assured (although you can tell Marco Dapper as Troy is a newcomer), and the direction moves the story along so well that I was never thinking it should have been more or less.  The replacement of Ryan Carnes (no matter how hot he is) as Marc is a smart one.  The new Marc, played by Brett Chukerman, is better even though I resisted it at first.  Over the course of the movie his charm came through.  Honestly, the sequel could be a stand alone film as you don't necessarily need to know the happenings of the first film to get into this one, but it does help.

It may not have been a blockbuster, or the best next hit indie film, or the even the next big gay film.  But those of us who seek out smart and hilarious entertainment for our homo film collections should pick this one up, no matter your feelings about the original.  I loved it from start to finish.  It made the first film seem like our own first time: Uncomfortable, embarassing, and unsure.  The second time around we know what we're doing.  The film is no different.",1225152000,3,2172,4.337468982630273

But Eating Out 2 is a breath of fresh air and just the type of gay film we need.  It is not a message film -  not a serious coming out film or a serious aids film.  Instead it is a well acted hilarious, fun-filled joy ride.

The characters are all so likable and the plot very fun and amusing.  Cute guys, sexy scenes - what more can one look for?  The film manages to be very pro gay, pro monogamy and pro sexual expression.

I highly recommend this film for any gay person or open minded person just looking for a fun film that will provide lots of healthy laughs.",1219795200,2,691,4.059259259259259
2696476,5,B000KN7BLI,"Touted as ""the first American gay sequel"", ""Sloppy Seconds"" achieves the rare trick of sequels---it surpasses the original. Don't get me wrong; the first was enjoyable, yet it didn't quite meet its potential. Their were flaws in the writing, acting & directing.
""Sloppy Seconds"" seems to be a more fully realized production, bringing back the characters Kyle, Gwen & Tiffany in starring status. Blonde hunk Ryan Cairnes is absent this time around, with the role of Marc filled by a brunette hunk and capable actor named Brett Chukerman. The object of desire this time is an unbelievably gorgeous stud named Troy, who is modeling nude for a life drawing class. Marco Dapper is quite the find, beautiful to look at from head to toe. It's discovered that Troy is sexually ambiguous as he confesses his attractions for both sexes. Upon hearing this, the game's afoot as Kyle (the adorable Jim Verraros) & Tiffany strive to bed the stud. Complicating matters is Kyle's estranged boyfriend Marc, who plans his own strategy to bag Troy---by being his gay self. As in the first film, Gwen manipulates Troy into a steamy photo session with Marc, with interesting results.
Being a modern screwball comedy like the first film, things spiral out of control as each party screws things up big time with Troy as he discovers their duplicity. Add to this a hilarious subplot about an ""ex-gay"" therapy group on campus (in which poor Kyle masquerades as a ""reformed"" guy dating Tiffany *?!?* as part of the plan to get Troy) and ""Sloppy Seconds"" comes off as a hysterically funny ""Friends"" episode.
Helmed by a different director this time (with Allan Q. Brocka staying on as producer), ""Sloppy Seconds"" looks more confident in execution. Deftly directed, with good performances and even sharper dialogue, ""Sloppy Seconds"" is a feast for the ears as well as the eyes (although the yummy guys in this one can't be beat!).
And c'mon, guys--a third movie would be great! (Wink wink, nudge nudge!)",1209945600,3,1976,4.919161676646707

2696478,1,B000KN7BLI,"The title says it all really - sloppy second movie.  I have waited for this for so long.  I loved Eating Out and was hoping for much more (and better) of the same.  No it was quite anticlimactic- this says it is the first gay sequel but they just relied on a bit of slapstick and a weak script. The nude model and new guy Troy (Marco Dapper) is much better looking than the Eating Out original movie Marc (Brett Chukerman) who was supposed to be the hotty - he was notty the hotty.  This is a farce which is not the genre I tend to like - was it supposed to be?  The romantic ribbons of story in the first story are missing in this cobbled together sequel. On a positive note Tiffini (Rebekah Kochan) is becoming better on screen - she was too campy over-acty in the last movie.  In this one she is slimmer (not that she was fat before, she was certainly voluptuous:0  .  She is looking stunning in this one.  On the other hand I didn't take to Emily Brooke Hands in this one, Gwen was just poorly regurgitated...no growth, stale.  The story is poor, the premise is ridiculous, and I missed the original Marc.

A comedy of deception and errors like the premise of a gay man out of peak against his partner plays straight using what they think is a hetero as part of the scheme. But at the same time there is doubt about Troy's sexuality. He ends up like me bi. And it is a biologically provable position. Maybe because I am not use to such women the way the girls acted as accomplishes was instructive. But is this not the exception to even the norm of pop society trends? Of course, I really got off with the scene of Troy & Kyle finally getting it off & the former's sexuality is revealed through play-acting. Interesting & very Shakespearian!

8158230,4,B000KN7BLI,"""Eating Out 2: Sloppy Seconds"" hasn't the chops of a ""Gone with the Wind"" by any means, but it does make several interesting points.  Can a person whose sexual identity is fixed by his/her entry into maturity, radically change that identity?  In my case, before 6th grade I knew I was different than my contemporaries.  By Junior High School, I knew what to call myself.  Marco Dapper and Brett Chukerman satisfy my sensibilities much better than any of the young ladies in the film, and nothing could change my mind.  I have never personally known a person who insisted they were bisexual.  Friends who once called themselves bisexual always settled on one of the other choices and then stayed there.  Perhaps inertia or societal pressure explains their reluctance to change.  I think of Anne Heche, who has been married to both a woman and a man, and found herself happiest with the man.  Eating Out 2 unscientifically, and perhaps unemotionally comes to its own conclusions.  Right or wrong, the film wasn't the obnoxious farce it could have been, and stereotypes aside, I, for one, enjoyed the nudity, if nothing else...  RobtheElder",1499472000,,1137,4.900523560209424
