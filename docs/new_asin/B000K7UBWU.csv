8154721,5,B000K7UBWU,Mike was a master and it shows here...good illustration of techniques used in OT styles that don't get a lot of exposure...,1498348800,,123,4.636363636363637
8154722,4,B000K7UBWU,"To early to rate any higher, but I really like the photography which shows both hands.  I didn't need the tabs.  I also was able to slow the speed more with my computer app (VLC) without distorting the voice.  For me, tabs seem to slow the muscle memory of learning the music as its hard focus on listening when reading.  I purchased, to learn a two finger style and only about 20% of the tunes dealt with that,  but after watching the other styles it makes one want to learn different styles for different tunes.  My skill level is probably intermediate.",1411862400,2,555,4.445544554455446
8154723,5,B000K7UBWU,"EDIT:
I contacted the publisher about the wrong copy inside the box and they immediately sent me another copy which arrived within a couple of days.  Very pleased with the content as well as the customer service and dependability of the publisher.  Homespun will definitely have more of my business in the future.  Highly recommended!

I ordered all three of these DVD's in this series and when I opened volume 2 there was a volume 3 DVD inside.  No big deal yet, just waiting until the manufacturer rectifies the error.  I have brought this problem to their attention and will give more stars based on the attentiveness and helpfulness of the publisher in response to the error.",1390003200,,683,4.745762711864407
8154724,5,B000K7UBWU,"This DVD is pretty much as listed.  A DVD instruction for Old Time finger picking banjo styles.  It covers 9 songs, and as previously stated Seeger plays them full speed, then breaks down slowly the differing parts.  The DVD comes with a very helpful booklet of tablature imitating the way Seeger is playing.  The tablature is clearly written and easy to understand.  With video and tab I don't know what more someone could desire.  The booklet isn't just tab either, but some history and notes, and bibliography of suggested quality banjo recordings to listen to.  I thought the depth of the booklet was a pleasant surprise as when I first considered these videos- i didn't realize there'd be any written supplemental material.",1335657600,3,728,4.918032786885246
8154725,5,B000K7UBWU,"I would like to review this product but more than a month after it was ordered it still has not been delivered.  I originally wanted to give this as a Christmas gift but until about a week after the confirmation I had no idea that the item was going to take so long to be delivered.  Amazon should be a bit more upfront about their product offerings.  I am sure that Mike Seeger does not have to create each video and in the product description, when it is not in current stock, it should be noted.  Unfortunately, for all of the videos in this collection, the delay is a couple of months.

The DVD finally arrived (in August) and like other Seeger products it is first rate.  In each of the songs Mike goes through the specific style at full clip and slowly.  You need to play this through several times because a lot of his style is subtle - but the DVD is well worth the price for anyone interested in old time banjo styles.",1200096000,6,927,4.232954545454546
