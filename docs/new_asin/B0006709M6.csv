2170906,5,B0006709M6,I have a question for anyone who has seen the dvd... Is there footage of her opening act Ryan Cabrera?,1100822400,,102,4.15
2170907,5,B0006709M6,"First of all- jessica simpson can outsing xtina- i mean yeah jessica hits high notes- and she does them very well- xtina relies to much on ""ohhhh ahhha ooo wowo wwowow""she is a great singer- but vocally has no comparisons 2 jessica- jessica voice is way better- stronger- and jessica is way hotter- jessica simpson has class- she has had that since her first album- i like christna alot- but when it comes to her and jessica- jessica is way better- i love jessica simpson to death- i went 2 her concert in wilmington nc- awsome- she sounded as good live as she does on her cd- in the studio- her new christmas cd is awsome too- i love to hear her sing im gonna love you forever an d angels- her rang on that song should def get her a grammy- she has outshined everyone this year- and her show didn't make her famous- she show proved to the world that she is a normal person- what u see is what you get- wiht xtina and britney its different- but people need 2 stop hattin on britney - leave the girl alone already- damn lol- but i don't like xtina always putting brintey jessica and kelly clarkson down- I LOVE YOU JESSICA -",1100649600,5,1123,4.252336448598131
2170908,5,B0006709M6,"I went to Jessica's concert in Salt Lake City, Utah on July 22nd, 2004. I was on the second row and smack in the center.  It was the best concert I have ever been to.  Jessica's voice is so strong and incredible!  I can't wait for the DVD to be released! Anyone thinking of buying the Reality Tour DVD, DO IT!! If it is anything like her performance in Salt Lake City, it will be worth every penny.",1100390400,7,398,4.076923076923077
2170909,4,B0006709M6,"Ok...this is to the man who said she [Jessica] can sing better than Christina. I'm planning to purchase this DVD, and I already have the Stripped: Live in the U.K. DVD by Christina Aguilera, who is a phenomenal singer and entertainer. But how could you compare a starlet voice to a much better phenomenal one? IT's like comparing Britney to Celine. Sure Jessica sings AWESOME, but have you noticed she really has to belt out, and looks like she can only reach those notes once in a blue moon. With Christina, she doesn't because she has the chords to reach such a high platform of ""oooh lala"".

I will still purchase the DVD, because she is one of the Pop Princesses 0f the legendary year of 1999. She actually can sing compared to Britney.

Although her voice in huge, she will never be as popular as Christina (my current infatuation) and Britney (I hate her). Mandy is doing well for herself too, she is a great actress.

Jessica make this DVD be worth it!",1100304000,,959,4.5
2170910,5,B0006709M6,"Jessica Simpson is a brilliant singer... i loved her since she sang at a promotional concert in houston over 5 years ago... she sang 'i wanna love you forever'... that is the first time i heard a voice that made me cry (and that is strange if it is coming from a 6'4"" BLACK MAN!!! LOL).

X-tina aguilera has nothing on this girl... don't get me wrong X-Tina can sang but live Jessica takes the cake for me.... Jessica sings with passion and you know that deep in your heart that she should have made the Mickey Mouse club with Britney Spears-Ferdeline, Justin Timberlake, X-Tina, etc.

im feeling the new joint 'angels'. robbie williams version is not all that great... the only song i don't like on the record but i love when she sings it live, 'with you'...its annoying on the radio (i guess)

if you like jessica buy it the tour was great....",1099872000,10,845,4.438709677419355
2170911,5,B0006709M6,"WEll, i am really looking forward to this DVD.  I attended the July 18th concert in Albuquerque,NM. I had 6th row, and had the time of my life!  Her concert was great, she DID sing live, and sounded beautiful.  The concert set was so beautiful and angelic too!  I will definately suggest all of you to buy this DVD, because Jess's performance was awesome!

2170912,5,B0006709M6,I also live in Canada and cannot go to her live concert. This is the 2nd best thing that could happen! I always wanted a concert DVD from her and now it's coming! Merry Christmas!!!,1097971200,6,181,4.2
2170913,5,B0006709M6,"I am so excited! I live in Canada so I was not able to see the concert and the only one was in Vancover, but I live in the east coast so... Anyway, I heard what songs she performed and I love all of them all especially ""Irresistible"" Here is the set list:

2170915,5,B0006709M6,Jessica Simpson is an amazingly talented person. This video shows you that and more about her. It shows you that she's goofy and can belt it out. She is my idol I love her.,1255996800,,172,4.088235294117647
2170916,1,B0006709M6,i love jessica simpson but this dvd is the worse ive ever seen do not buy this one all she does is twirl around and shake her but its not entertaining after the first 10 mins,1219104000,,174,3.861111111111111
2170917,3,B0006709M6,"Jessica seems to be real nice, down to earth person who loves her fans.  Not many artists talk to their fans, let them ask questions, and get personal with them. Very rare you get to see this.  I would have loved to be front stage at her performance!

Her singing wasn't top notch like you'd hear in her CDs but you have to consider the fact that her CDs capture Jessica's best singing.  If you're on tour a lot, your vocal cords do get worn out so forgive her.

The wardrobes she wore were kind of goofy looking, but this is Jessica Simpson we're talking about.  She's notorious for being a goofy person.",1213056000,,605,4.3097345132743365
2170918,1,B0006709M6,"A real YAWNER! Just when, pray tell, will those 15 minutes of fame run out for this shallow bimbo and her equally talentless lip-syncing younger sister? Their dad sure knows how to keep stoking the publicity.",1165363200,,208,4.805555555555555
2170919,2,B0006709M6,"JS CONCERT WAS THE MOST BORING THING I HAVE EVER SEEN ON DVD! MY CAT WAS MORE INTERESTED IN WATCHING IT THEN I WAS, AND THAT WAS ONLY BECAUSE OF JESSICA'S FRILLY COSTUMES! THE SOUND SYSTEM STANK! I WAS EXPECTING HER VOICE TO ECHO LIKE CRAZY. ALL OF JESSICA'S SONGS WERE ABOUT EXPRESSING HER LOVE FOR NICK. THIS DVD IS SO BORING I'M FALLING ASLEEP JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT TO SAY ABOUT IT.  OH YEAH...HER VOCALS WERE TOO BREATHY, THAT PINK THING SHE WORE LOOKED LIKE A FLAMINGO CAUGHT IN A SHREDDER, AND SHE SHOULD HAVE LEFT TAKE MY BREATH AWAY ALONE!  NICK DIDN'T TAKE HER BREATH AWAY SHE TOOK HIS WHEN SHE DECIDED TO WALK OUT OF THEIR MARRIAGE! NICK WILL BE SINIGING I'M TAKING HALF AWAY!, AND JESSICA WILL BE SINGING I SHOULD HAVE PRENUP!",1141862400,,746,4.359712230215828
2170920,2,B0006709M6,"I bought this DVD after watching Jessica Simpson's latest music video ""These boots are made for walkin'"". I thought her Reality Tour Live will have some catchy songs and video but was very disappointed. May be OK for those who just want to watch Jessica sing.",1123027200,4,259,4.6521739130434785
2170921,1,B0006709M6,Jessica Simpson is a talentless bimbo.  She is more concerned with shopping than she is with being a singer role model - a title that she so proudly proclaimed after bashing Brittany and Christina for showing too much skin.  We all know now that the hypocritical Jessica Simpson would shed her clothes if the price were right.  She is NOT a role model and her songs/tv specials are lower than below average.,1121731200,7,407,4.625
2170922,4,B0006709M6,"So what have y'all been smoking? Sure, Jessica Simpson can sing (especially in her beginnings with 1999's lukewarm smash Sweet Kisses), but not particularly on this DVD. She has some serious vocal affections that hinder her natural sound and distort her pop croonings (she comes off as a Britney wannabe). Interestingly her more tepid and boring tunes from In This Skin sound the best (including ""My Way Home""). Her rendition of ""Take My Breath Away"" is decent, as is the touching ""You Don't Have to Let Go"" (her ""I can love because you love...me"" is nothing less than beautiful), but her awful performance of ""Angels"" falls extremely short of expectations (she sounded much better on VH1's Divas Live). In the end, her Reality Tour 2004 is a decent but much less stellar concert given by a girl who does have talent. Throw out that Britney-trademarked growl, Jessica, and the odd vocal quirk that makes it sound as though she's choking back a song rather than singing it and you can soar. Decent, but not great.",1121731200,5,1012,4.788571428571428

2170924,1,B0006709M6,"I cannot understand why people would buy anything by this brainless ,talentless bimbo. She cant sing a song without stupid vocal gymnastics,she cant say anything intelligent and she has a perpetual spaced out expression on her uncharasmatic face. Im sick of switching on the tv and seeing her and that equally boring and talentless ""husband"" of hers. Please avoid this tripe and support people who actually made it because of talent and not a slick marketing team.",1116720000,5,464,5.038961038961039
2170925,3,B0006709M6,"She has huge potential but none of the songs are that great. Her sister Ashlee is actually a better performer and has more edge in her songs and better lyrics or something. Overall, good but something missing in the songs or songwriting.",1104883200,6,237,4.666666666666667
2170926,3,B0006709M6,"I was really lucky to get a front row seat to her Radio City Music Hall sold out show... and I gotta tell you, this DVD doesn't reflect at all the experience of being there.  Besides I don't think the crowd at this show was the best for the DVD filming.

I'm a Jessica Simpson fan but was really dissapointed to find out that there were a couple of songs missing here including one of her best performances on the show ""I wanna love you forever""... I was just blown away when she hit those high notes.

If you are a JS fan, this is a must... otherwise, you can live without it.",1104451200,11,577,4.088495575221239
2170927,4,B0006709M6,"This is a nice DVD of Jessica Simpson's Reality Live Tour. This was the last date in LA, back in July or so this year. The setlist is pretty good, with the songs mostly from her IN THIS SKIN album (of course since that's the latest and the one she's promoting on the tour). She sings all but two of the songs from that album (sadly ""In This Skin"" and ""Underneath"" were not a part of the concert). Otherwise she only sings two of her older hits, ""Irresistible"" and ""I Think I'm In Love With You"". She has some fans onstage and takes a few questions from them, and takes time to talk between songs which is always nice. Also some clips from her reality show Newlyweds. Overall a nice concert, would have been nice if there was more songs since it's only above an hour in length, but it's still good. Vocally she sounds awesome, even better than on her albums.",1103673600,5,857,4.296296296296297
2170928,5,B0006709M6,"I bought this DVD not even realizing it was a concert type DVD and LIVE. It included some clips from Newlyweds and also had the video of ""Angels"" and the ""Making of Angels"" which were rather awesome.

I like to put it in and just let it play while cleaning the house.",1102982400,3,267,4.134615384615385
2170929,5,B0006709M6,"I would just like to say that this DVD of her concert was great. She can really sing, and even in this DVD she still lets us in her life with more footage of her and Nick. I think they make the cutest couple, and wish them all the best. If you like her CD's and Newlyweds then this DVD is for you. I'm looking forward to her next one.

One or two songs are cut from the show, but overall its a great show!",1102377600,,296,4.425925925925926
2170931,1,B0006709M6,"Most important, her overall singing is mediocre and her voice is fine. When I listened ""Take My Breath Away"" I was totally pissed off. She should in no way try that classic pop song.

She can't dance. Some other young singers like Britney may not sing good too but their dance look entertaining. Her move on the stage in no way looks like a star's.

The costume looks aweful, looks like pajama and striper's first layer outfit. Making her looks short and fat.

This is the worst music DVD I bought.",1102291200,2,498,4.450549450549451
2170932,4,B0006709M6,"I just watched the DVD of Jessica Simpson's concert! It was fabulous!  Jessica sounds a lot better live than she does on her three albums. She sounded very superb on Take My Breath Away, Sweetest Sin, Angels (powerful singing she does on that one), Loving You (which sounds better than the low budget production song on the album), Forbidden Fruit, and the heartfelt You Don't Have to Let Go (I'm sure that Joe Simpson, her dad, must have been in tears backstage that his shirt had to have been a little wet).  She had an excellent band and I loved her background singers.  Her parts where she talked with the audience kept it from being your typical, stick to the song list live show. Her mentions of her family, as well as her parents, Nick Lachey and her sister Ashlee, added a personal feel to the concert. I believe that at the time of this concert, her sister Ashlee had a No. 1 album and she sounded so very happy about that. Her outfits were lovely and added a feminine touch to the show. Loved the stage as well as the lighting, strobe lights and ramps. The clips from Newlyweds were smartly placed in the show between some songs--some were very funny.  They said that this was one of the lower grossing summer tours, but who would miss this show?  This was one of the best concerts of the year.  And Jessica is a true star and talent in her own right! You can sure be singing it, girl!!!!!!",1101859200,5,1400,4.386100386100386

2170934,4,B0006709M6,"I have never seen Jessica sing live, but I have all her cds.  She really does a have a powerhouse voice. She doesn't skip out on any high notes, in fact she relishes in them.  I like that about a performer. The only thing I was extremely disappointed in is the performance of I Wanna Love You Forever, was not included.  Very disappointing.
