3159059,4,B0016MJ6EC,"I was born right in the middle of the Boston Strangler murders, and I've learned only bits and pieces of the story over the years.  So, it is impossible for me to say how accurate this story is.  Most likely, not very much.

I have seen the film starring Tony Curtis with the same title, and I thought that that film was really good, at least through the first two acts.  As a matter of fact, that other film was superior until the third act; the split personality scenes unfortunately pushed that train right off the tracks.  It's really too bad, because otherwise, you could easily argue that it was a really good film, almost even great.  Oh, well.  It strangled itself, I guess.

This version seems to imply that Albert DeSalvo was not really the killer, but was actually railroaded by others and his own stupidity.  I suppose it is possible, except for the following immutable fact (I'm playing Monday Morning Quarterback a bit since information was obtained after this film was shot around 2008):  according to a USA Today article that released in 2013, it was determined that Mr. DeSalvo's DNA was an exact match for evidence found with the final victim of the serial killings.  Of course, if he killed one of the victims, he very well could have killed all of them.  And if you think about it logically, most likely he was the Boston Strangler, given the quite recent evidence.

But people like conspiracy theories for one reason or another.  While I usually don't discard them offhand, I believe that they need to be held to real scrutiny.  And some conspiracy theories with regards to this case were strengthened a bit when Mr. DeSalvo later recanted his story, but the most likely scenario there:  usually, when lawyers get involved, they tell their clients to introduce FUD as much as possible, especially when the client couldn't keep his mouth shut early in the investigation.  Oh, FUD would be ""fear, uncertainty, and doubt,"" and you create that by changing the story after the fact to the version that you want people to believe.

But still, I actually kind of liked this film.  It was interesting, and I do believe that it introduced some idiosyncrasies owned by Mr. DeSalvo, in particular the whole ""measuring man"" thing that I don't believe was much shown in the earlier film.  You have to admit, that was at least mildly creepy, and that in itself showed Mr. DeSalvo's true character.  Also, I think that David Faustino showed some range here from his character on ""Married with Children,"" although you could easily argue that both characters he played were stupid.

Really more of a 3.5 I suppose, but I'll round up today for some odd reason.",1398902400,6,2663,4.706263498920086
3159060,4,B0016MJ6EC,"This movie follows the case pretty closely. David Faustino is great, so good I didn't realize it was ""Married With Children""s ""Bud"" until halfway through. It's probably best viewed if you're familiar with the case. DNA does prove De Salvo was not the Boston Strangler (at most if he was, he had a partner but it's far more likely he was a copycat killer who came along after the real one).

What's most disturbing is that this case, officially never solved, is the basis for FBI profiling and modern forensics...despite they got the wrong man. They mention Jack the Ripper which is funny, since that ""case"" was the basis for modern police work, although Jack never existed (seriously, look it up, it was a few unconnected killings connected by a Scottish reporter).

When you see how easy it is for the wrong man to go down in our system, it is unsettling. They even include and point-blank state a character ""Narras"" based off a real man, was the Strangler. Although most experts agree he was the real killer, the end note of the film does provide an unsettling note: one victim had DNA under her nails from 2 different people...neither De Salvo. From the beginning it shows (using one character) how many detectives thought they were dealing with two suspects.

Totally worth watching with some great performances. It does tend to skim over some events, so again, you'd better read up on the De Salvo case before watching, but then enjoy!",1395273600,,1440,4.729083665338646
3159061,1,B0016MJ6EC,"Working on my own novel about Albert DeSalvo and the events that surrounded his crimes and confessions, I've committed to exploring all the published works about Albert DeSalvo, who was my mother's favorite uncle, and directly impacted by the Strangler Bureau media circus as her father, Albert's brother Joe, tried so desperately to help Albert while his own family fell apart.

Initially excited to come across a title so recently released, I watched it, ipad in hand.  I found myself wondering throughout the picture, ""Who is Michael Feifer, this writer/director/producer, with a cameo appearance?  And what connection does he have to this story?""  With each successive scene, I surmised that his connection was likely to be none other than a recipient of hand-me-down anecdotes, perhaps of inmates who ""knew"" Albert.

The movie's portrayal of the Strangler investigation alone is so skewed as to include Albert in a line-up for the Stranger murders, which never actually happened.  This is important because when investigators retrospectively looked at their activities, they realized that they never considered Albert DeSalvo as a suspect because he was well-known as a petty thief--a completely different category of crime.  Breaking and entering was his thing, at least before his stint as the Measuring Man.  And at that, the Measuring Man was about 3 things:  feeling superior for having duped highly educated women, getting a cheap thrill and making quick cash.  Albert never engaged in violent behavior at that time, unlike the movie's depiction--which had Albert in a completely different classification of criminal during the Strangler Bureau's Investigation.

Am I attempting to fuss over the fact that this movie's portrayal of Albert DeSalvo gives us intellectual whiplash, yanking us back and forth between glimpses of his initial gullibility (and the regret that became his undoing), and scenes in which he rivals Jekyll & Hyde's emotional stability?  Not really.  I'm simply a believer in a writer's responsibility to be forthright about what they're presenting to the public.

The movie's title set me up to prepare for a review of all the familiar players of that time.

Instead, I kept pausing the movie and looking up names I'd never heard, like ""Paul Winfield"" who was apparently supposed to represent the real-life, first black police commissioner in Boston, MA, Edward Brooke.

Paul Winfield announces the formation of the Strangler Bureau, and its' leader, Fred Addison, who later tapes Albert's confession.  In reality, this was John Bottomly.

And yet even the changed names were inconsistent, lending to deep confusion.  Identifying Albert's children by their correct names, Judy and Michael, it named his wife ""Claudia,"" instead of Irmgard.  Albert never had a brother named Michael or a sister-in-law named Sondra; the only husband-wife sibling team that visited Albert in jail was Albert's brother Richard and his wife, Rosalie.

The man identified in the line-up, who later became Albert's cellmate was identified as ""Frank Asarian,"" but the real-life inmate who was instrumental in developing Albert's get-rich-quick scheme was a sociopath named George Nassar.  He was from a wealthy family, who had reportedly spent quite a lot of money keeping George out of the press for the sake of the family name.  Talking Albert into confessing to the Strangler crimes was just an extension of that strategy, and it was effortless to pay a hot shot lawyer.

 George Nassar's attorney, F. Lee Bailey (apparently portrayed in the movie as Stuart Whitmore, who laughably referenced working 'pro-bono'--AS IF) convinced Albert of all the money he would make, taking book and movie deals after his conviction.

The opening scene shows Albert calling a doctor named Dr. Arlen who was familiar with him; in reality, Albert called 2 people the night before he was killed; F.Lee Bailey, and Dr. Ames Robey.  While the progression of the murders and victims was completely inaccurate, I found it strange, if not in poor taste that the original names of the victims were used.

I would give this movie a half-star if I could, just for the attempt, and for getting a few facts straight.  However harsh that sounds, my reaction comes from the fact that only after the title's promise and the painful content does the movie reveals it's standard disclaimer as a fictional work, which means 1 of 2 things to me; either the writer did not have the will or the guts to get the facts straight enough to straightforwardly declare the work a non-fiction, OR the writer knowingly wrote a fictional piece, including just enough of the facts to reel the viewer in, promising revelation of ""truth,"" while delivering the same fluffy nonsense I endured while reading Sebastian Junger's ""Murder In Belmont.""

In the vernacular of Ebert & Roeper:  ""I give this a 2 thumbs down!""

Stay on the lookout for my new book, ""In the Shadow of the Strangler,"" due for release later this year!

3159064,2,B0016MJ6EC,"This ""untold story"" of Albert DeSalvo, who claimed to be The Boston Strangler suggests that Desalvo really wasn't guilty and was merely a conman and pervert.  It has been assumed that Desalvo was not the Strangler due to evidence collected later and the case remains unsolved.
David Faustino (MARRIED WITH CHILDREN) is miscast as Desalvo.  His perfomance is a caricature of method acting with little polish or maturity.  I just didn't find him convincing at all.  Ditto to Andrew Divoff as the world-weary detective, Kostas Sommer as Desalvo's co-conspirator and possibly more, and Corin Nemec's turn as the sheisty lawyer.  Writer/director Michael Feifer has little artistic vision or sense of creativity.  He offers an alternate theory but doesn't commit to exploring or exposing the alternative strangler.
Overall, an interesting premise lost in a dull execution.",1329264000,,866,5.377777777777778
3159065,3,B0016MJ6EC,"I was expecting a slasher type of film from the DVD cover. Instead what I got was more akin to a historical drama. This is what we believe is the story of Albert De Salvo (David Faustino), the man who confessed to being the Boston Strangler. The film shows several women being strangled, but not really grindhouse style, more of a Hitchcock style. The accents were good. The acting and plot was decent, although the story just never grabbed me. There is no nudity and no graphic rape scenes, just disturbing strangling scenes. It is interesting from an historical sense, but not overly entertaining, yet not a bad film. Hence the so-so rating.

3159066,5,B0016MJ6EC,"Now that is is commonly accepted that Albert DeSalvo was most likely not the Boston Strangler, but instead was just a sneaky little conman & pervert, who just happened to be locked up in a mental asylum with several known psychopaths & serial killers, most of whom were out at the time of the stranglings, including the sociopath George Nassar who is protrayed in the film as the real killer. So, as opposed to the Tony Curtis classic, which is basically a fictionalized version of these crimes (like how Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a fictionalized version of Ed Gein), this film is very low budget, but director Mike Feifer is vetren in the serial killer movies field & ol' Bud Bundy himself David Faustino does, in my opinon, the greatest, most accurate depiction of Albert De Salvo that was ever on film.

3159067,1,B0016MJ6EC,"We were on a serial killer kick and decided to check this out and it was very slow.  Also, it seems to lack some information.  From the movie Albert was jobless and in a somewhat disfunctional marriage and was paid to appear in police line ups.  It only shows Albert killing one woman.  The rest are done by other people.  Yet, it mentions that the 5 original victims were older and the others were copycats.  So Albert didn't kill every one of them...but only the one?  Anyway, when the police arrest him the movie doesn't show why or what evidence they have on him.  The police just pull him over in a car and the next thing you know Albert is in jail.  It would have been nice to have been shown the reasons.  Also, the movie never cleared up why exactly Albert was so attached to his prison roommate.  The acting was ok.  It was interesting to see the young man who played Bud Bundy in a much different role.",1299888000,,912,4.269005847953216

The movie seemed to forget that it was set mostly in the early 1960s. Several examples: Back then, rape was not called ""sexual assault."" There were no clothing size 4s, as one of the victims said she wore; in fact, size 4 only became available in Boston in the mid-1980s. A completed Prudential building was shown in 1963, but the Pru wasn't finished until 1964. Finally, the dispatch operator in the background says ""911,"" but that emergency number didn't exist until 1968. I have a feeling this movie was put together with the idea that no one would notice, which makes me feel the director, producers, etc., underestimated the audience, or simply didn't care.",1473120000,7,832,4.866197183098592

3159098,3,B0016MJ6EC,"The Boston Strangler, 2008 film

Albert DeSalvo calls his doctor from prison; he wants to talk about the Boston Strangler who killed many women who lived alone. They show the attack on one young woman. The details are printed in a newspaper, this compromises the investigation for the police. A woman picks one man out of a line-up. Later Albert introduces himself as a talent scout for a modeling agency and impresses a young woman and gets her to disrobe. Later the police arrive to investigate the death. There is not one MO to indicate a single murderer. We learn about Albert DeSalvos personal life and his problems with his wife. The police find another victim, the knot around her neck is different. Later another woman is attacked and strangled. The killer wears gloves to leave no fingerprints. The type of knot is a clue, also the ages of the women, says one detective. A politician reorganizes the police squad. A computer will be used to gather reports: 37,000 pages!

DeSalvo has a car accident and is sent to a hospital. An inmate recognizes him from last years line-up. Albert doesnt sleep much. They show a shooting from an earlier time! One policeman worries about his wife; he heard a noise. The police visit DeSalvos cell to talk to him. He is a family man with a child and a dog. [Newspapers predicted the killer would be an unmarried man.] DeSalvo wants the reward money because he is facing life in prison now. This reward will be split up. The confession ends the mystery. Alberts brother and sister-in-law talk to him, and question his decision. A hospital for the insane is better than Walpole prison says Albert. Albert studies photographs of the crimes to refresh his memory. A man arrives to tape-record his confession. [Is he being coached?] They recreate the strangling (he used a stocking). Lets take a step back. But Albert is sent to Walpole! He was afraid of this.

Albert was a former MP in the Army and a boxer. But he wants to change his story after six years. He calls his doctor to tell the truth about the murders. [Who was listening in?] Two men enter his cell. Snitch is all they say. Albert was killed in prison from multiple stab wounds. The last victim of the Boston Strangler had DNA from two different men, neither of them DeSalvo! The murders of the Boston Strangler was never solved in court said the Epilogue. Did DeSalvo take the blame to put an end to the hysteria? Were careers made from this conviction?

This is a good story in spite of its low budget and weak script. A book will tell you more about this case, if you want to spend your time on that. There was very little about life in Boston and America shown in this movie. These events occurred around 1963-1965. The Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 was a shock to the nation and was followed by many other changes in society. The War in Vietnam grabbed peoples attention from other events.",1452038400,,2904,4.589595375722543

Albert never had a brother named Michael or a sister-in-law named Sondra; the only husband-wife sibling team that visited Albert in jail was Albert's brother Richard and his wife, Rosalie.

The man identified in the line-up, who later became Albert's cellmate was identified as ""Frank Asarian,"" but the real-life inmate who was instrumental in developing Albert's get-rich-quick scheme was a sociopath named George Nassar.  He was from a wealthy family, who had reportedly spent quite a lot of money keeping George out of the press for the sake of the family name.  Talking Albert into confessing to the Strangler crimes was just an extension of that strategy, and it was effortless to pay a hot shot lawyer.

 George Nassar's attorney, F. Lee Bailey (apparently portrayed in the movie as Stuart Whitmore, who laughably referenced working 'pro-bono'--AS IF) convinced Albert of all the money he would make, taking book and movie deals after his conviction.

The opening scene shows Albert calling a doctor named Dr. Arlen who was familiar with him; in reality, Albert called 2 people the night before he was killed; F.Lee Bailey, and Dr. Ames Robey.  While the progression of the murders and victims was completely inaccurate, I found it strange, if not in poor taste that the original names of the victims were used.

I would give this movie a half-star if I could, just for the attempt, and for getting a few facts straight.  However harsh that sounds, my reaction comes from the fact that only after the title's promise and the painful content does the movie reveals it's standard disclaimer as a fictional work, which means 1 of 2 things to me; either the writer did not have the will or the guts to get the facts straight enough to straightforwardly declare the work a non-fiction, OR the writer knowingly wrote a fictional piece, including just enough of the facts to reel the viewer in, promising revelation of ""truth,"" while delivering the same fluffy nonsense I endured while reading Sebastian Junger's ""Murder In Belmont.""

In the vernacular of Ebert & Roeper:  ""I give this a 2 thumbs down!""

Stay on the lookout for my new book, ""In the Shadow of the Strangler,"" due for release later this year!

3393561,2,B0016MJ6EC,"This ""untold story"" of Albert DeSalvo, who claimed to be The Boston Strangler suggests that Desalvo really wasn't guilty and was merely a conman and pervert.  It has been assumed that Desalvo was not the Strangler due to evidence collected later and the case remains unsolved.
David Faustino (MARRIED WITH CHILDREN) is miscast as Desalvo.  His perfomance is a caricature of method acting with little polish or maturity.  I just didn't find him convincing at all.  Ditto to Andrew Divoff as the world-weary detective, Kostas Sommer as Desalvo's co-conspirator and possibly more, and Corin Nemec's turn as the sheisty lawyer.  Writer/director Michael Feifer has little artistic vision or sense of creativity.  He offers an alternate theory but doesn't commit to exploring or exposing the alternative strangler.

3393562,3,B0016MJ6EC,"I was expecting a slasher type of film from the DVD cover. Instead what I got was more akin to a historical drama. This is what we believe is the story of Albert De Salvo (David Faustino), the man who confessed to being the Boston Strangler. The film shows several women being strangled, but not really grindhouse style, more of a Hitchcock style. The accents were good. The acting and plot was decent, although the story just never grabbed me. There is no nudity and no graphic rape scenes, just disturbing strangling scenes. It is interesting from an historical sense, but not overly entertaining, yet not a bad film. Hence the so-so rating.

So, as opposed to the Tony Curtis classic, which is basically a fictionalized version of these crimes (like how Texas Chainsaw Massacre was a fictionalized version of Ed Gein), this film is very low budget, but director Mike Feifer is vetren in the serial killer movies field & ol' Bud Bundy himself David Faustino does, in my opinon, the greatest, most accurate depiction of Albert De Salvo that was ever on film.

3393564,1,B0016MJ6EC,"We were on a serial killer kick and decided to check this out and it was very slow.  Also, it seems to lack some information.  From the movie Albert was jobless and in a somewhat disfunctional marriage and was paid to appear in police line ups.  It only shows Albert killing one woman.  The rest are done by other people.  Yet, it mentions that the 5 original victims were older and the others were copycats.  So Albert didn't kill every one of them...but only the one?  Anyway, when the police arrest him the movie doesn't show why or what evidence they have on him.  The police just pull him over in a car and the next thing you know Albert is in jail.  It would have been nice to have been shown the reasons.  Also, the movie never cleared up why exactly Albert was so attached to his prison roommate.  The acting was ok.

The movie seemed to forget that it was set mostly in the early 1960s. Several examples: Back then, rape was not called ""sexual assault."" There were no clothing size 4s, as one of the victims said she wore; in fact, size 4 only became available in Boston in the mid-1980s. A completed Prudential building was shown in 1963, but the Pru wasn't finished until 1964. Finally, the dispatch operator in the background says ""911,"" but that emergency number didn't exist until 1968. I have a feeling this movie was put together with the idea that no one would notice, which makes me feel the director, producers, etc., underestimated the audience, or simply didn't care.",1473120000,7,832,4.866197183098592

Albert DeSalvo calls his doctor from prison; he wants to talk about the Boston Strangler who killed many women who lived alone. They show the attack on one young woman. The details are printed in a newspaper, this compromises the investigation for the police. A woman picks one man out of a line-up. Later Albert introduces himself as a talent scout for a modeling agency and impresses a young woman and gets her to disrobe. Later the police arrive to investigate the death. There is not one MO to indicate a single murderer. We learn about Albert DeSalvos personal life and his problems with his wife. The police find another victim, the knot around her neck is different. Later another woman is attacked and strangled. The killer wears gloves to leave no fingerprints. The type of knot is a clue, also the ages of the women, says one detective. A politician reorganizes the police squad. A computer will be used to gather reports: 37,000 pages!

DeSalvo has a car accident and is sent to a hospital. An inmate recognizes him from last years line-up. Albert doesnt sleep much. They show a shooting from an earlier time! One policeman worries about his wife; he heard a noise. The police visit DeSalvos cell to talk to him. He is a family man with a child and a dog. [Newspapers predicted the killer would be an unmarried man.] DeSalvo wants the reward money because he is facing life in prison now. This reward will be split up. The confession ends the mystery. Alberts brother and sister-in-law talk to him, and question his decision. A hospital for the insane is better than Walpole prison says Albert. Albert studies photographs of the crimes to refresh his memory. A man arrives to tape-record his confession. [Is he being coached?] They recreate the strangling (he used a stocking). Lets take a step back. But Albert is sent to Walpole! He was afraid of this.

Albert was a former MP in the Army and a boxer. But he wants to change his story after six years. He calls his doctor to tell the truth about the murders. [Who was listening in?] Two men enter his cell. Snitch is all they say. Albert was killed in prison from multiple stab wounds. The last victim of the Boston Strangler had DNA from two different men, neither of them DeSalvo! The murders of the Boston Strangler was never solved in court said the Epilogue. Did DeSalvo take the blame to put an end to the hysteria? Were careers made from this conviction?

This is a good story in spite of its low budget and weak script. A book will tell you more about this case, if you want to spend your time on that. There was very little about life in Boston and America shown in this movie. These events occurred around 1963-1965. The Cuban Missile Crisis in October 1962 was a shock to the nation and was followed by many other changes in society. The War in Vietnam grabbed peoples attention from other events.",1452038400,,2904,4.589595375722543

Yes, there are various theories regarding the murders during the early 60's; however, most do not believe that DeSalvo murdered all of the women that have been attributed to the ""Boston Strangler"".
