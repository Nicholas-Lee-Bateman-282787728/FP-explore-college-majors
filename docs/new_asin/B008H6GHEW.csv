5164592,5,B008H6GHEW,The DVDs of season 1 and 2I of Happy Endings were shipped to me right away and I received the item very soon after making my order/purchase ob Amazon. This show ia hilarious and is exactly what I wanted when I made the order!,1347321600,,225,4.136363636363637
5164593,5,B008H6GHEW,Happy Endings is a great show for anyone in their 20s. The writing in hysterical and includes lots of pop culture references that anyone in our generation will remember from when we were younger through the last couple years.,1346112000,,225,4.794871794871795
5164594,5,B008H6GHEW,"From the first episode I fell in love with the tv sitcom. Its so hilarious and the great part about the show is there is no awkward first few episode where the characters are still trying to get along. The chemistry on the show is great and its just makes it even funnier how naturally all the characters mingle. The characters are very different from one another to make it an interesting cast but similar enough to make the group seem realistic and the interaction between them is fun to watch. Both season one and two are amazing, I cannot wait for season three in the fall. The only problem I found is the way the season two dvd case is designed. The case was made so that all 3 season two discs are stack on top of each other instead of separate slots, but its no big deal since this show is awesome anyways. I highly reccomend this series, I've already watched season one and two twice and now even my friends are hooked!",1345420800,7,927,4.3028571428571425
5164595,4,B008H6GHEW,"the show is great, and fast becoming one of my faves of all time. that said, this review is about this dvd release-

the studio isn't releasing season 2 (by itself) of this show until october. until then, we get this box set of season 1&2, to persuade us into buying both seasons. this WOULD be great & all, except i actually already own season 1. so now, if i want season 2, i have to either buy this set or wait til october...

basically, they are punishing the bigger fans of the show by making them wait til october, or by making them spend money buying something they already own. either way, it sucks.",1345161600,8,607,4.269565217391304
5164596,5,B008H6GHEW,"I love this show, everything about it is perfect.
and this set was awesome (although I already had the first season
but I didn't want to wait till Oct 2 for Season 2).
The only thing that was a let down was that the episode
""KickBall 2: The Kickening"" was not included, but I guess
since it is going to air as part of season 3 it will be included then.
But I highly recommend this series!!!",1344902400,5,390,4.077922077922078
5164597,4,B008H6GHEW,"If you're reading this review, chances are, you already know about the show.  I won't go into too much detail about the show itself.  All I will say is that I enjoy the show.  The characters have great chemistry, and the writing is surprisingly fresh given the big Friends vibe.

This specific set is a great purchase for anyone who has watched the show casually or is wondering what the show is about.  First off, though the item description lists this set as having 2 discs, that is incorrect.  There are 5 discs in total, 2 for season 1 and 3 for season 2.  Each season is shrinkwrapped in a standalone case and a cardboard slipcase keeps them all together.

The only thing that slightly disapointed me was the lack of special features.  The ones that are included are good, but I really would have liked some more.  The features listed in the item description are an all-inclusive list.  We have some deleted scenes, some outtakes, and small selection of random things for season 1.  That's pretty much it.  Had there been some more decent features (like some episode commentary from this very funny cast), this would have gotten 5 stars.  As it stands, I still recommend it for casual fans, diehard fans, or even curious viewers.  The price is right.  Two seasons for $26 (or whatever it might be by the time you read this) is well worth it.",1344902400,25,1346,4.545833333333333

5164629,5,B008H6GHEW,BEST SHOW EVER!,1459123200,,15,4.333333333333333
5164630,4,B008H6GHEW,"Looked everywhere for the blu ray, settled for the DVD which was received promptly! The price is amazing for IMO the 2 better seasons of wit, bantering & fast past dialog. Happy Ending is sure to be the pick me up on a blue day, and leave you with a smile on your face! Reminds of shows like Friends mixed with Scrubs..",1456272000,,319,4.161290322580645
5164631,5,B008H6GHEW,"Fast delivery. Exactly what I thought, great show.",1455753600,,50,5.375
5164632,5,B008H6GHEW,Amazing series! I have shown many of my friends clips of the show and they all enjoyed them. The episodes are available on Hulu if you have a subscription and want to get into the series as well!,1454284800,,195,4.157894736842105

5164635,5,B008H6GHEW,Hilarious show.  Too bad it only ran for 3 seasons.,1452729600,,51,4.1
5164636,5,B008H6GHEW,One of the greatest TV shows ever. Sad to see it go...,1444003200,,54,3.5833333333333335
5164637,5,B008H6GHEW,this is the funniest sitcom in the whole world and I have never loved any other tv better! It took a while to arrive but it was worth it! so happy,1395100800,,146,3.7419354838709675
5164658,5,B008H6GHEW,"Send these to my son while in Afghanistan.  THey were well enjoyed by him, his men and then were left there for the next wave.  I have heard they all are enjoying.",1391558400,,163,4.0625
5164659,5,B008H6GHEW,"Love this show.  Snappy dialogue, likable cast, offbeat humor.  I wish that they had seen fit to issue the 3rd season in a similar format rather than as the wildly overpriced DVD on demand that Amazon offers.",1385856000,,208,4.594594594594595
5164660,5,B008H6GHEW,Liked the combination of two seasons with all the extras.  Would buy again if I had to gift this to anyone.,1372896000,,107,4.095238095238095
5164661,5,B008H6GHEW,"These people are 6 of the THE most riotous people ever most especially
Adam Pally, Damon Jr, and of course the gorgeous Eliza Coupe. I knew she
had it after watching her in Scrubs",1371081600,,179,4.294117647058823
5164662,5,B008H6GHEW,"One of the best shows on TV right now. This series constantly delivers laughs and fun plot lines even though ABC has jerked this series around since it aired. Pop culture references that actually work. Characters that are different from typical sitcom archetypes. Character behavior that is just far fetched enough to keep things light and hilarious. This series has endless replay value as well. I find myself rotating between Happy Endings, Parks and Recreation and New Girl seasons when nothing is on.",1364428800,2,504,5.0843373493975905
5164663,5,B008H6GHEW,"I had never seen this show, but someone recommended it to me.  I love it.  The characters are terrific and very funny.",1362528000,,118,4.318181818181818
5164664,5,B008H6GHEW,"Love this show! Some of the bonus portions are a bit slow moving, but the episodes are great, cast is great, show is hilarious...",1360627200,,129,4.416666666666667
5164665,5,B008H6GHEW,Love this show! It is a must see. I recommend it to everybody that has any kind of sense of humor.,1360281600,,98,3.7142857142857144
5164666,5,B008H6GHEW,I was a HUGE FAN of Friends and I basically memorized every episode since I've watched the box set so many times. Soooo glad this show came around to take its place. I love to laugh ,1360281600,,182,4.055555555555555
5164667,5,B008H6GHEW,This was a great deal for getting two seasons! The show is hilarious. Can't wait to get the third season!,1359676800,,105,4.3
5164678,5,B008H6GHEW,"First of all I am not rating this product as a 5 star like it the greatest item ever, I am rating this product as follows, would it have been the same product if I bought this at the retail store, was it worth the money saved to buy it online, and am I happy with the product I got in the mail. If all those are a yes for me then I will give it 5 stars. I am not just rating it 5 stars cause its the best product of its class, that is for each person to decide. I will also be updating the reviews as I see fit if I decover something in the future. Thank you for taking the time to read my review.

I got 2 seasons for well under the $50 it would have cost to get it in the stores. This was a great buy and I love being able to catch up on this show without breaking the bank.",1358985600,,776,3.619047619047619
5164679,5,B008H6GHEW,I think the show is well paced and consistently funny from episode to episode. Well written storylines and each character is well developed and given a chance to shine,1358640000,,167,4.793103448275862
5164680,5,B008H6GHEW,This show is hilarious and i've watched it over and over and over again since i bought it!  Lent it out to a few friends and they all loved it as well.,1358380800,,151,3.71875
5164681,5,B008H6GHEW,In the search results this comes up as $28.00 (Prime) but when I click on the item it says 45.88 (you save17%) and the price before sale is 45.99... that's not 17% off.,1358121600,,168,4.121212121212121
5164682,5,B008H6GHEW,This show got me from the first episode. It is funny while making observations of our current culture. You have a great mix of friends with their own hang ups trying to get through life. It reflects at least one person you know.,1357948800,,228,4.325581395348837
5164683,5,B008H6GHEW,I love this show and it's definitely one you can watch over and over again and not get tired of.  I like the fact that the episodes are in chronological order on the DVD rather than the strange order they were aired on tv.  Everything makes much more sense that way!,1357689600,,266,4.196078431372549
5164684,5,B008H6GHEW,"this is my favorite show,Now I can watch all episodes all over again. So no need to record them;since I know have the full season",1357603200,,129,4.2
5164685,5,B008H6GHEW,"Nothing left to say that everyone else hasn't. The fast paced wit reminds me of Arrested Development but it also has a cool-kids modern feel to it that highlights Chicago in the same way that Sex and The City illustrated New York City.

The best way to describe the tv show is Friends meets a slightly less amoral version of Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia.

Buy the dvd's but also watch the tv show episodes on ABC so that they keep renewing for new seasons!",1357344000,,460,4.4
5164686,5,B008H6GHEW,"I started watching this show during my second deployment; the show's characters are good and it's laugh out loud funny. Favorites are Jane, Penny and Brad; although all of them are funny and the characters have good chemistry.

Least likable character is Max.",1357084800,,259,5.023255813953488
5164687,4,B008H6GHEW,"I love Happy Endings. It's one of my favorite comedies on air. I was thrilled to see this bundle on Amazon, and I purchased it for about the same price as season 1 alone. The special features aren't that special, but then again I don't buy these things for the special features, but for the show itself.",1356048000,,303,4.333333333333333
5164718,4,B008H6GHEW,"Very Funny.
I received it, watched it and laughed out loud. Great cast, Good Writting and didn't cost that much.",1355788800,,112,4.65
5164719,5,B008H6GHEW,Can't stop talking about this show. More people should embrace the crazy antics of this functionally dysfunctional group of friends,1355788800,,131,5.6
5164720,5,B008H6GHEW,"This is a really cute, funny show, and the price for 2 seasons makes it worth it.  I rarely buy TV shows on DVD but am glad I purchased this.",1354060800,,141,3.7
5164721,5,B008H6GHEW,We just can't have enough of this show.  All the characters are super funny.  Every time that we watched we find more fun stuff to laugh about. LOVE IT!,1353888000,,152,4.206896551724138
5164722,5,B008H6GHEW,"Happy Endings is probably the funniest show currently on TV - great cast, great jokes and showing no signs of running out of ideas in its 3rd season. If anything it's getting better and better. Buy this DVD, it's hilarious!",1352764800,,223,4.6
5164723,5,B008H6GHEW,"This show is absolutely hilarious.  If you don't watch it, you're completely missing out.  Each character is amazing in their own ways.  Eliza Coupe and Damon Wayans, Jr as Jane and Brad have the most ridiculous chemistry and play off each other so well.  I love Adam Pally as Max.  Really I love all the characters, I don't think I could pick a favorite.",1351296000,3,355,4.484375
5164724,5,B008H6GHEW,"This show is HIGH-LARIOUS and A-MA-ZING! I'm so glad there's a Season 3, can't wait for it on DVD too. =)",1350086400,3,105,4.0476190476190474
5164725,5,B008H6GHEW,"This is a pretty good show.  Good characters, great writing, and it has a pretty decent plot.  The packaging is pretty nice, it's just the two cases for each one.  The S2 packaging is a little odd, it's just a normal DVD case with a long thing for three DVDs on one side.  That being said, it's better than most ""collection"" packaging.  Good deal, good value...I'd recommend buying this and DVRing the new Happy Endings.",1348790400,2,420,4.546666666666667
5164726,5,B008H6GHEW,Couldn't believe the price for both seasons.  This is my favorite show on TV right now and it seemed too good to be true to get this before season 2 came out by itself in October. But it was true and I had a Happy Endings marathon as soon as it arrived!  You will not be disappointed by this show. It is very funny and you will fall in love with each character!,1348444800,,361,3.9315068493150687
5164727,5,B008H6GHEW,One of the funniest show on tv right now. Loved re-watching this series. Caught a lot of jokes I missed while laughing so hard the first time.,1348358400,,142,4.296296296296297

8528129,1,B008H6GHEW,"The DVDs arrived, I watched season 1 and loved it. It took me several months to have time to start season 2, however, and when I opened it up, I saw that Disc 1 was cracked. The DVD case is poorly designed, with all three DVDs stacked on top of each other, and I'm sure that's what led to the top one cracking. Unfortunately, as I mentioned it's been several months, and I don't think Amazon will give me a replacement, so I'm stuck with a DVD I can't watch.",1487030400,,458,4.1

8528134,5,B008H6GHEW,"One of the funniest shows ever. WIsh they didn't cancel it.  On the one hand, i thank ABC for letting us have 3 seasons of this show, but hate them for cancelling it so soon.",1471910400,,174,3.9714285714285715
