8029375,5,B0002MFGCS,LOVES IT! Enough said! :) He is 3 years old and is just now getting into all the superhero stuff.,1380585600,,97,3.9
8029376,4,B0002MFGCS,While not as good as the Batman Animated Series this cartoon does a great job of telling modern Superman stories.  These episodes are random so it is better to get the complete season one since the ones included here are not all the best episodes.,1279065600,,247,4.488888888888889
8029377,2,B0002MFGCS,"There is nothing better than Animation complete Box Sets on DVD, but Warner and other companies with other DVD titles insist in releasing those horrible discs with random, separeted episodes. It's pretty bad those masterpieces (like Superman, Batman and Marvel 90's cartoons) were being treated this way. But fortunately, the Series Collections is coming out in January, so I suggest to keep your money and wait for it.",1103587200,7,419,5.176470588235294
8029378,1,B0002MFGCS,"Okay Warner Bros. now I know you've lost touch of the fans. Why would we want to buy this DVD containing 2-3 episodes, when we can wait for the ENTIRE first season of Superman TAS to come out at Christmas time. You guys have to rethink your marketing and fire the guys who are making these awful decisions to bring out these meesly 3-4 episode DVD's.......GIVE THE FANS WHAT WE WANT.....CAUSE WE REFUSE TO BUY INTO THESE ANYMORE!!!!!",1100044800,7,433,4.564102564102564
8029379,4,B0002MFGCS,"This is like a ""Greatest Hits"" or sampler of the entire SUPERMAN animated series from 1996-2000.  The upcoming January release of Season One will only cover one of these episodes, so it's a good way to tide you over until all the sets come out.

You get four episodes selected from the entire series fifty-four :

""A Little Piece of Home""(episode # 5 -- Lex Luthor discovers a weakness for Superman)

""Speed Demons"" (episode # 17 -- The Flash and Superman race in an homage to the original comic from which the plot is lifted)

""The Late Mr. Kent""(episode # 35 - Clark Kent appears to die trying to save a death row inmate)

""Where There's Smoke"" (episode # 42 - a mutant ""Fire starter"" steals some precious sea history pieces)

They are all quite solid stories which are well animated with top notch voice acting.  Tim Daly (Wings) provides the voice of Superman, while Dana Delany (China Beach) is Lois Lane.  Clancy Brown (extensive voice work including Spongebob Squarepants  and an actor in The Shawshank Redemption) plays Lex Luthor who surprisingly resembles Telly Savalas in his animated form.  This is the team of producers and animators who gave us the great Batman the Animated Series as well as Batman Beyond, The Justice League, and The Teen Titans.  But where Batman was dark and brooding, this series is more bright and wholesomely optimistic.  Action is hardly ever at night, and Metropolis seems like a great place to live as opposed to Gotham City where crime seems to ooze from the sidewalks.  This would seem to be a ""greatest hits"" compilation from the three seasons.  You get some very impressive guest stars voicing the supporting characters.  Peter Gallagher (American Beauty), Dennis Haysbert(24), Peri Gelpin(Fraiser), and William H. Macy are all in ""Where There's Smoke"".",1099785600,13,1798,4.884488448844884
8029380,1,B0002MFGCS,"okay, this show is good. However, the DVD is not, and that is why i have given this release one star. Otherwise i would give the show itself 5 stars. I guess if you want to continue collecting the show if you have (or even if you dont' have) the last son of krypton disc. This contains eps. 4-7 i believe, and is a worthless buy. why? well, ponder this. On january 25th the first 18 eps. will be coming out in a boxed set with the following box sets in approximately 5-10 months apart (per release)from the january release There will be three box sets of 18 to equal the 55 eps. this show had. Or you could just wait and get 4 new eps. every 6 months. Your choice. 3 box sets...or 15-20 individual discs....",1095120000,22,707,4.1678832116788325
8029381,4,B0002MFGCS,"This is a good buy if you want a DVD for entertaining the short attention span of your kids. But, if you are an adult (which this is a good series for those who love the genre), keep demanding the release of season boxed sets just as they fabulously did with Batman: The Animated Series Season 1. These are excellent epsiodes but are only worth the price if you are collecting the other DVDs with 3-4 episodes per disc.",1094601600,13,419,4.3164556962025316
