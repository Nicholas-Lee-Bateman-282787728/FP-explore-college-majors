8278397,3,B001AOW6RK,"Lum and Abner were on the radio, Monday through Friday, for decades, 15 minutes each night.  There was something comforting about sitting around the radio and laughing at their malaprops and misadventures.  Two radio actors played the entire cast, from Squire Skimp and Grandpappy Spears to Cedric Weehunt and Dick Huddleston.  And, of course the two old fellows who ran the Jotem Down Store.  If you never heard them, then the movies will be lost on you.

When they cashed in on their popularity by going to the movies, the illusion fell apart, because other actors had to play the extra characters, and somehow that just didn't work very well.  Amos and Andy made only one movie, and that didn't work either.  Alas.  People who never listened to the radio programs, in their time and ethos, will wonder what is going on with the movies and why anyone bothered to pay to see them.",1273276800,,881,4.675324675324675
8278398,1,B001AOW6RK,"The major problem with these ""B"" films is that they are in no way funny.  There is a bit of populist romanticism, but you'll fail to find anything that is unpredictable or even amusing. You'd be embarrassed by reading the scripts.  Remember that the years in which these films were made are still within the ""golden age"" of American movies, including the often brilliant Screwball comedies.  Lum and Abner fail to rise to the level of the Bowery Boys. In short, don't bother.",1254009600,2,475,4.698795180722891
8278399,4,B001AOW6RK,"I encourage anyone who likes the Ma and Pa Kettle films to seek out the Lum and Abner films. Although these two series of movies are very similar in tone, the L and A films were produced on a skid-row budget, but do not fret, because this doesn't mean that they're not as enjoyable. In fact, the ultra cheap budget actually enhances the atmosphere of these cornpone ditties. All four of the films in the boxed may be brainless affairs, with somewhat familiar stories, but it's the chemistry of the two stars and the major input from basically unknown supporting players that add a sense of fun, and even surrealism, to these harmless and extremely enjoyable little films. I would be hard-pressed to name the best movie of the four, as they all provide the same amount of fun and escapism, but I suppose I would say ""So This is Washington"" may edge out the other three films.....but just by a slight margin.
Again, I'll use the word ""surreal"" because it's the one that fits the best to describe these wacky programmers from a long ago era. These films not only take you back in time, they take you to places you've never even dreamed of.....a place that even Ma and Pa Kettle couldn't take you, and all the while providing a wonderful journey. Perhaps Lum and Abner will make a huge comeback in the near future. Heaven only knows how much we need some fun and offbeat escapism from this vicious world we live in. Lum and Abner may be just what the doctor ordered to cure a very unhealthy planet.",1250035200,9,1494,4.4963235294117645
