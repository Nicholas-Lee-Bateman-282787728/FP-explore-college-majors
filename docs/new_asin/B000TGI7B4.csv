8208926,5,B000TGI7B4,"I saw a few episodes of Two Fat ladies in Italy broadcasted by SkyTv, and fell totally in love with them. I purchased the dvds and almost ate them out as soon as I received the parcel. This is a real piece of history, although the recipes are a bit out of date, they taste good, and both ladies make me laugh a lot. Just a pity though there are no subtitles, not even in english, since I'm not a native speaker I would have appreciated them to catch all bits of conversation.
I definitely suggest it, it's a great purchase.",1407110400,,523,4.188118811881188
8208927,5,B000TGI7B4,"Simply brilliant - funny informative ""so British"" - when we are living in New Zealand and far away from our original birthplace of the UK. Excellent value for food ideas, regions they visited, their humor their style , their wordly knowledge - it is clear they have both lived all over the world.

The DVD has given us hours of pleasure as I knew it would. Sadness too that the UK lost a ""good un"" with Jennifer passing. So thrilled I have them both (Jennifer and Clarrisa)on DVD forever - rock on girls.

Such fun  - recipe for sheer delight xxxxxxxxxxxxx",1391558400,2,556,4.485148514851486
8208928,5,B000TGI7B4,"If you enjoy traveling and eating tasty food, you'll enjoy watching this cooking show with the ""Two Fat Ladies."" These women are humorous and talented cooks. What I like about this cooking show is that they travel to and fro in an old motor bike and side car to the places they are going to cook at and on the way collect, purchase new and regular ingredients for their recipes on the way. they travel the English countryside while doing so. In doing so they travel to a variety of places and cook in a variety of places from inside a monastery, inside a convent and even in a large tent for a local Boy Scout group.
Overall, I love this series. The women are humorous to watch and they are talented in cooking too. I have made a least a dozen different recipes from this show and all were yummy, different, yet most are not very healthy, but simply tasty. I particularly love their Shooter's sandwich. Lots of good food are cooked on each episode, most likely recipes you have never heard of before.",1382227200,3,1000,4.410810810810811
8208929,5,B000TGI7B4,"I loved the show when it was first broadcast and was so happy to find the CDs at such a reasonable price. Amazon.com is my go-to place for books, movies and CDs.",1375228800,2,161,4.0625
8208930,5,B000TGI7B4,"I agree with the other reviewers.  These ladies are wonderful.

The cooking sequences in these episodes demonstrate time-tested ways of cooking fine cuisine.  It includes a lot of handy tips that you might not otherwise know.  For example, when adding cream to melted chocolate, make sure the cream is room temperature; or, put tomatoes in boiling water for one minute to easily remove the skin.

Jennifer Paterson was born to missionary parents in China.  She travelled all around the world as a chef for the privileged class of people who hired her.

The other lady was a barrister (trial lawyer) until she was 34 years old and took up cooking, around the world, as a passion.

This show isn't just about cooking, it is about all of the wonderful scenery, sources of fresh dairy, produce and meat available in rural areas, and, the best that England has to offer in the way of traditions and style.",1356652800,6,900,4.7243589743589745
8208931,4,B000TGI7B4,"I absolutely adore these ladies. They are very entertaining and their comments are hilarious.
The recipes are delicious and heavy duty. Lots of lard, cream, just good old fashion ingredients.
Although I will admit I make modified versions with olive/corn/and or grape seed oils, and low fat cream or condensed milks.
I am also a huge fan of anchovies, mustard, spices, and anything rich with strong flavor.
They use a lot of these ingredients in many of their recipes.

It's not just a cooking show, they travel to different places, talk to the locals, purchase fresh and natural products, and always have many insightful tid-bits about the history of the different ingredients they use.",1286755200,10,687,5.026315789473684
