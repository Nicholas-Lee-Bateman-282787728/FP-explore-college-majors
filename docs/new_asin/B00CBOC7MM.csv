Michael, the seller, even included a hand-written note.
It is a beautiful, interactive, well-made video. I will listen, talk, and sing along. I think it will be helpful in my continuing efforts to learn the Twi.
Michael said that Volume 2 is coming soon.",1429228800,,339,4.666666666666667
8579986,5,B00CBOC7MM,Using the DVD as a tool to learn the twi language. Has been very useful for myself with learning new words. Easily engages young children... and adults alike for a matter of fact. Highly recommend for both the young and old!,1372809600,,224,4.487804878048781
8579987,5,B00CBOC7MM,"This DVD is a great learning resource and a fun way to learn Twi! Our family has some fluent Twi speakers, some who only know a little bit of Twi and some who don't know any at all...and everybody loves this DVD from the oldest to the youngest.  I originally purchased it for our children because we want them to be fluent in several languages, including Twi, but once we started playing the DVD even the adults were learning and having fun with it. The DVD is slow paced and easy for children (or adults that are new to Twi) to follow.  I love that it features beautiful African children and images of real objects (as opposed to cartoons). My toddler runs to the TV when the songs come on. The songs feature the familiar tunes of ""Head, Shoulders, Knees & Toes"" and ""If You're Happy and You Know It Clap Your Hands"" but all sung in Twi! We look forward to future Twi DVD's from this company.",1372118400,2,893,4.309523809523809
