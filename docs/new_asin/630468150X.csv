905867,3,630468150X,"It could have been a mediocre but believable picture with a good cast until the last 20 minutes or so. Then it became a bunch of unlikely explosions, mixed with even more unlikely equipment functions, paired with superhuman acts culminating in a stupendously unbelievable ending while remaining absolutely mediocre in every way. A good movie to watch if you want to be entertained & nothing more while dozing on a rainy afternoon.",1499904000,,430,4.986111111111111
905868,1,630468150X,"One of the worst movies out there - corny, illogical, dumb, disrespectful. The plot is so shockingly unrealistic like it makes Star Wars seem real. I could go and on about the atrocious main events. Mainly the film is disgrace to law officers everywhere, it portrays them as the most inept, untrained and stupidest people on earth. A convoy of police and guardsmen is not just going to fall into an ambush led by a bunch of vile cons, they are not going let themselves be blasted off their motorcycles by a fire hose. It portrays the murder of policemen as no big deal. And shame on such great actors to let themselves get involved in such cinematic garbage. Save yourself some brain cells, do not watch this movie.",1499817600,,715,4.550387596899225

Nice Cage defends his wife and in turn kills a guy.
Prison is his home but he's finally going home but he has to get a ride on a plane with the worst convicts ever. What happens next is so good I don't want to spoil it.  Suffice it to say this is one of Nic's best movies. I've seen it three times and will watch it again and again and I don't usually watch a movie even a second time unless it's really good and this one is better than good.

Special effects are so incredible..",1491264000,,558,4.054545454545455

906318,5,630468150X,"First I will start with the disclaimer that I do not own this DVD. I don't even know anyone who owns this DVD. So this review is strictly a review of the 1997 masterpiece ""Con Air"" and not of the DVD release of Con Air. Although I am sure the DVD is of the same caliper as the film and is figuratively seeping with treasures like deleted scenes, commentary, and (one can only hope) hilarious bloopers of the actors palling around and generally having a silly time.

I just watched this movie for the first time since it came out and BOY HOWDEE what a roller-coaster ride. I mean this movie has it all! Never ending action, an all star cast, rock solid score, and a plot that dives into the complexity of the diverse characters like a stone sinking deeply into a vast lake. I could never have hoped it would be this good upon watching it this afternoon, but I thank my lucky stars that it was.

Nicholas Cage's performance is only matched in greatness by his unwavering dedication to doing what is just and right. Even after allowing a broken system to imprison him he fights (on his daughter's birthday no less!) to make sure his friend and an innocent guard stay safe. Is the antagonists as interesting and well done as the protagonist you ask? Well there is only one way for me to answer that. You bet your buttons he is! John Malkovich also shines in this film by delivering his role with the power of a Shakespearean villain.

If you manage to get a spare hour and fifty-five minutes in your busy day I couldn't suggest an activity more rewarding than watching this film. Don't spend it re-stringing your sitar. Don't spend it cooking a delicious meal consisting solely of hot wings for your friends.  Don't spend it wasting time with your only child. WATCH THIS MOVIE!

""Make a move and the bunny gets it!"" - John Malkovich as Cyrus Grissom.  I think this quote says it all.",1486166400,,1879,4.4476744186046515

906433,3,630468150X,This is a good action movie.  My favorite Nicholas Cage action movie.  Tied with Raising Arizona as my favorite  Nicholas Cage movie.  Which really is going from one extreme to the other.  John Cusack who is one of my favorite actors is very good in this.  As is everybody really who is in it.  John Malkovich and especially  Steve Buscemi give good  and maybe a little unusual performances.  And Buscemi has the movies best line.  When the song Sweet Home Alabama is playing. This is one of those movies that is good even after you have seen it a few times.,1484524800,,558,4.425742574257426

906627,5,630468150X,"The blurb on the package calls this a ""High-energy Action"" movie and it certainly is...more explosions, shootings, and death-defying leaps and bounds than I've seen in a long time.  When a judge makes an example of Army Ranger Cameron Poe and sends him to prison, he serves his time and is ready to be released when he's sent back home on a plane transporting some of the worst prisoners in existence.  Suffice it to say, the prisoners take over the plane and Poe, who has a chance to leave, stays behind to help the one friend he has onboard.

There's an allstar cast and the acting is over the top because each action is playing it to his type-cast best so it's very, very good.  Colm Meaney as a pushy DEA agent will make the audience wish for the punch in the face he never gets, as he overrides every order agent John Cusak gives, doing more harm than good. John Malkovich and Steve Buscemi play the psychopaths to the hilt, and Nicolas Cage, with a cornpone accent making this Southerner cringe, is his usual edgy hero.

The audience will need a rest after this movie because it's definitely full of action.

No joke, this was a perfectly crafted terrible film with solid actors (and also Nick Cage, he's there too) playing delightfully silly tropey characters delivering wonderfully bad lines, all with a multimillion dollar FX backdrop.

906935,5,630468150X,"I recently had the pleasure of listening to Chad Dukes discuss CON AIR on his podcast and it prompted me to get out my own DVD copy and watch it again for the first time in many years and was pleased to discover that it was just as great as the first time I saw it back in the theater in that long ago summer of 1997. But seeing it again made me a little sad, as it is now a stark reminder that the old clich is very apt in this case: they just don't make them like this anymore.

Looking back now, its clear CON AIR was the high water mark of the Golden Age of the Action Movie, the era that gave us SPEED, THE ROCK, AIR FORCE ONE, MISSION IMPOSSIBLE and the first couple of DIE HARD sequels; the kind of films that made Jerry Bruckheimer a fan favorite.  These movies were cheerfully over the top in the way good comic books are; filled with great dialog, scenes of mass destruction where every explosion looks like a huge gas tank going up with along with tough guys trying to annihilate each with everything from bullet spewing automatic weapons to wicked looking knives, and if nothing else, their fists. These were movies based on a ridiculous and improbable premise that served as a perfect hook for a easy to please audience yearning for good entertainment.

The hook for CON AIR was Nicholas Cages Cameron Poe, a good man who caught a bad break which landed him in a tight situation where he has to be a hero if he wants to get home to his wife and daughter.  Poe, a hero of the Persian Gulf War, accidently kills a drunken lout in a bar fight and inexplicably ends up in Federal Prison; when he finally wins parole, Poe gets a ride home on a prison flight filled with some of the worst criminals ever put in solitary confinement. Things go south in mid air when John Malkovichs Cyrus Grissom, a brilliant criminal mastermind leads the rest of the very hardened criminal passengers in a successful plan to take over the plane and escape across the border.  On the ground, US Marshall, Vince Larkin, played by John Cusack, is desperately trying to find a way to get the plane back, the prisoners recaptured and do so despite the incompetent interference of superiors and co-workers.  This sets off a convoluted plot filled with narrow escapes just in time, epic confrontations, ambushes, double crosses, and a showdown on the Vegas strip that is wonderfully over the top as Simon Wests script works overtime to top itself.

The big pull for CON AIR has always been the violence, which is excellently staged, not only in the fore mentioned Vegas Strip finale, but especially in the middle section of the film when the plane puts down at the isolated desert airport.  But every true fan of the film knows that the movies real strength is the performances, which gives some great actors plenty of scenery to chew and spit out.  Cage was at the height of his stardom in the mid 90s, having just won the Oscar for LEAVING LAS VEGAS, and was considered a serious actor at the time; Cameron Poe gave him a great opportunity to use some of his best tricks, starting with an affected Southern accent that is impossible to forget. At first, the laid back Cusack seemed an odd choice for an action blockbuster, but it proved to be a piece of inspired casting as Cusacks distinct style of cool intensity proved to be perfect fit with the overwrought eye rolling of his co stars.

By some accounts, Malkovich was less than happy with his villain role and the project itself as a whole, if so, it doesnt show up on the screen; he commits totally to the role of Cyrus the Virus, letting us never forget that his greatest weapon is his super intelligent mind, a mind that bends a plane filled with sadistic criminals to his will by words alone.

Then there are the great acting contributions by Ving Rhames, Nick Chinlund, Danny Trejo, Colm Meaney, the young Dave Chappelle, Kevin Gage, M.C. Gainey, Conrad Goode, Ty Granderson, Rachel Ticotin, Mykelti Williamson, and two great character stars: Don Davis and Dabs Greer.  But the icing on the cake is still Steve Buscemi as Garland Greene, the detached serial killer who sits back utterly amused at it all; his conversations with Poe are classic bits, as is Greenes unnerving tea party with the little girl.  How great is it that the worst of the worst seems to be the sanest of the lot and is the only one to actually get away in a great final scene.  I consider CON AIR to be a direct descendant of the those great 60s films, THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN, THE GUNS OF NAVARONNE, THE GREAT ESCAPE, and THE DIRTY DOZEN, where a bunch of great actors were given roles that played to their strengths and just turned loose on the screen.

Yet watching CON AIR now makes me painfully aware of the passage of time, I agree with those who point out that if it came out today, the ridiculous plot twists and over the top action pieces would be picked apart on social media Friday night of opening weekend while Millennials would no doubt be horrified by some of the crude racial epitaphs thrown back and forth by the inmates. In the post 9/11 era, the action movie would become darker and much more serious, Cameron Poe would be replaced by Jason Bourne and a movie about a plane hijacked by criminals would not be considered fun. Even the villains would change, where in the 90s, great bad guys like Cyrus the Virus were cousins of Hannibal Lector, while now they are some variation on a terrorist. Though Nicolas Cage had a great summer in 1997, starring in both CON AIR, and that other action classic, FACE OFF, in the years ahead, a series of bombs and bad role choices along with an increasing tendency to over act would turn him into a punch line. The economics of movie making would change so much that a script like CON AIR, with its many speaking parts for many actors, would no longer be green lighted today unless it was a superhero epic like CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR.  And our entertainment would become so somber that in the 21st century, even Superman could barely crack a smile in a two and a half hour movie.  Personally, Id take Cameron Poe over Zach Snyders Big Blue any day.",1474502400,2,6124,4.473118279569892

906942,5,630468150X,"Released in 1997 and directed by Simon West, Con Air is an action/thriller starring Nicolas Cage as Cameron Poe, a former US Ranger and newly paroled ex-con who finds himself trapped in a prisoner transport plane where the hardened cons seize control, led by the brilliantly insane Cyrus the Virus (John Malkovich). John Cusack and Colm Meaney co-star as the two conflicting officers in charge of resolving the situation. Some of the more notable cons are played by Ving Rhames, Danny Trejo and Steve Buscemi.

My title blurb says it all: Con Air is a no-holds-barred action/thriller with a clever sense of humor in the compelling spirit of 1996s Broken Arrow, although I give Con Air the edge. Yes, the storys contrived and the movies overall cartoony, but its just so kinetic, amusing and well-executed you're inspired to go with it rather than go against it. In fact, youll probably find yourself hilariously laughing at moments, particularly in the third act. On top of this, the movie shoots for a little depth with the well-done (and amusing) redemption of a certain con.

The weak point is the lack of a quality female role. Sure, theres the guard on the plane played by Rachel Ticotin, but her role is rather one-dimensional; however, I do appreciate a later scene with her and Poe. Monica Potter is on hand as Poes wife, but her part is limited to standing around looking doe-eyed. Despite this cavil, Con Air delivers the goods for what it is; and spectacularly so.

The movie runs 115 minutes and was shot in Indiana, Utah, Nevada and California.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Here is my one and only guilty pleasure: CON AIR [1997]. Here is a lesson in manhood where Nicolas Cage gets to be innocently hijacked on a plane and has to save his diabetic buddy with lots of explosions and it is a totally gloriously boneheaded macho-fest rollercoaster ride from start to finish.

But here is a slight warning: If you have a slight fear of flying, then this film will not be for you. But for me and for some unknown reason, with CON AIR, is about a film in which an aeroplane transferring hardened nasty criminals is hijacked by its criminal passengers before being taken on a raucous rollercoaster joyride, has always had a comforting effect on me and I think (spoiler warning) it's because the good guys survive, but who that is, you will have to view this film and especially this high octane 1080p Blu-ray disc.

Of course, I'm well aware that Hollywood heroes usually live, but when I watched CON AIR for the first time in the cinema in 1997 that I hadn't yet had the pleasure of working my way through the abundance of cheap action flicks with all-American bad-asses and one-liner scripts churned out by Hollywood every year. Previously, one of my favourite films was Airplane, but of course that was the opposite direction and of course I considered CON AIR gives us a lesson in real macho manhood, so to speak.

And the starring man in this gloriously boneheaded macho-man fest is soft spoken Cameron Poe, played by a biblically long-locked Nicolas Cage. What a man Cameron Poe is, a former soldier, he has just been released from prison after serving time for manslaughter after killing a local drunk who berates his pregnant wife. After more than seven years doing handstand press-ups, learning Spanish and making friends with the help of the ""pink coconut things"" his wife sends him, he's ready to be transferred home with a fluffy stuffed rabbit to give the daughter he's never met. Unfortunately for poor Cameron Poe, a nutty bunch of Supermaxim lifers led by Cyrus ""The Virus"" Grissom [John Malkovich] who are also on the flight, have other ideas; they take control of the plane and Cameron Poe is forced to tread a delicate line between being an innocent good guy and a criminal in order to survive the trip. But basically the film is just about a man trying to get a toy bunny home to his daughter.

That's what I love most about CON AIR, because of all the masquerading; it really is a hysterically comic flick. The characterisation teeters just enough into the tongue-in-cheek side of clich to make it fantastically watchable. You've got the Dostoevsky-quoting field marshal Vince Larkin [John Cusack] waxing sociological with the brutish DEA agent Duncan Malloy [Colm Meaney] while they try to take back the plane; the quasi-profound Garland Greene [Steve Buscemi] who plays the OTT psychopath who turns up on board in a Hannibal Lecter-style face cage; and Joe ""Pinball"" Parker [Dave Chappelle] who gets side-tracked chatting up an airport employee in a hanger during a stop-off and almost misses the flight. There's also great action slapstick, like when (spoiler alert) Joe ""Pinball"" Parker's dead body is shoved out of the plane and lands on the bonnet of a car as the driver grumbles about his dirty windscreen.

But while the first half of the film is all about the hijack, the second half is essentially about a massive gun battle in an apocalyptic dustbowl scrapyard. Cameron Poe, who unlike the other prisoners is technically a free man, does actually get an opportunity to escape at this point, but turns it down because his prison cell chum Baby-O who happens to be diabetic and is in dire need of insulin. Did I mention Cameron Poe really is a great guy, who risks his life to get a syringe for a near-death Baby-O, in a fine homage to an oft-overlooked sub-genre of cinema; films that use diabetes as a narrative device?

Meanwhile, the plane takes off again, Cameron Poe's cover is broken and he is forced to fight for control of the aircraft for the epic finale; safely landing on the Vegas strip, a plane full of mad men crashing, cartoon-style into the American dream. It truly is a beautiful thing. I may be speaking for myself, but any action film that features the line: ""Make a move and the bunny gets it"", deserves to be watched at least seven times. CON AIR, is one flight you cannot afford to miss!

Blu-ray Video Quality  Touchstone Home Entertainment brings you this powerful action packed film CON AIR in a brilliant awe inspiring 1080p image transfer, and an equally impressive 2.35:1 aspect ratio. Despite of its age, it has a great picture quality with some surprisingly good quality images. Virtually throughout the film it has completely sharp images. The contrast and detail is at a high level, with mostly very vivid image with some very good depth. You also have minimum noise in larger areas, especially in the darker areas. Minimal visible ghosting throughout the film and there is no artificial sharpening.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Touchstone Home Entertainment brings you this powerful action packed film CON AIR with an equally impressive impacting 5.1 Dolby Digital audio experience. Even CON AIR follows the same rule as the other Jerry Bruckheimer productions: to crack it and the more intense, the better!  And Touchstone Home Entertainment here gives CON AIR namely not only provides a reference image quality but also a corresponding Home Theatre Sound experience especially in the numerous action packed scenes, where the walls of your lounge will tremble with great vibration. Here you have a full programme on offer: explosions are punchy, cannonballs hiss from one corner to the other and the engine noise of the CON AIR comes with plenty of deep bass therefore I can honestly say that action fans will find themselves in seventh heaven acoustic!  There are not many quiet scenes in this film, but even these have been well implemented sound wise, while dialogue remains always well understood even in fast-paced scenes. So well done Touchstone Home Entertainment.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Movie Showcase [2007] [1080p] [2.35:1] [2:33] Movie Showcase is basically a series of bookmarks that lets you demo the 1080p HD picture and sound quality by selecting three big cinematic moments from the film CON AIR. While it is presented in 1080p, the audio is in 5.1 Dolby Digital Audio, you do get the full HD experience. Touchstone Home Entertainment is basically giving you a Blu-ray demonstration of the three selectable scenes that are presented, the brilliant 1080p HD image quality with this Blu-ray disc, but personally I cannot work out why this has been included, very strange.

Special Feature: A View From Above [1997] [480i] [1.33:1] [4:38] This Making-of is just under 5 minutes and is basically seeing behind-the-scene documentary of the filming of the film CON AIR and some of the actors and several crewmembers have their say and they include Nicholas Cage [Cameron Poe]; Jerry Bruckheimer [Producer]; John Malkovich [Cyrus The Virus], John Cusack [Vince Larkin] and Simon West [Director] have far too brief words with their involvement in the film and you get to see a few set-shots. Basically, however, this is more or less a short promotional clip for the film, and this was originally only available as a DVD feature, that is why the quality of this video is very grainy.

Special Feature: The Destruction of Las Vegas [1997] [480i] [1.33:1] [2:40] This is a follow up documentary to the previous special feature where again we see behind-the-scene of the film CON AIR where you get to view them destroying parts of Las Vegas, especially with the CGI effects and other special effects inside the plane. We also get to view a miniaturised to scale of Las Vegas on the film set, to show you how they did the effects of the plane landing on the road and destroying parts of Las Vegas. We get also contributions from Jerry Bruckheimer [Producer] and David Goldberg [Visual Effects Supervisor]. Again this was originally only available as a DVD feature that is why the quality of this video is very grainy.

Theatrical Trailer [1997] [480i] [1.33:1] [2:28] This is the original Theatrical Trailer for the film CON AIR, but sadly not being shown in the 2.35:1 aspect ratio. Despite the slightly grainy image, it sure packs in a lot of hard action for this theatrical trailer, that really gives you a brilliant view of this film, to the point it makes you want to view the real macho testosterone CON AIR film.

Finally, here is another Jerry Bruckheimer high powered production value film and therefore another highly explosive rollercoaster ride of this always rapid all action film! CON AIR picks up basically where the film 'The Rock' has ceased and offers even more breathless action and this time mainly in the air.  Nicolas Cage maybe the hero throughout the film, while John Malkovich is perfectly cast to be the disgusting villain again. To add other forms of ingredients into this rollercoaster ride, on top of all that we have John Cusack and Steve Buscemi to add some familiar faces, to counteract especially the performer of nasty macho felons who clearly had their fun and delightfully over-acting personified. With such exaggerated story line, CON AIR is the best 1990s popcorn cinema.  Sit down (and do not forget to buckle up!). Switch off the brain and have a good over the top time! The film can also be technically convincing, since CON AIR, after all is a 1997 film, but still looks up-to-date and especially with a very good and excellent 1080p image quality and an even more powerful sound design. Sadly there are only two extras as an added bonus that has only a short run length and very poor standard definition presentation with only a slight inadequate impression. Fans of this immensely exaggerated over the top genre action cinema  la Jerry Bruckheimer will certainly not let down with this truly spectacular Blu-ray disc release is not to be missed! Highly Recommended!

I usually like Steve Buscemi and John Cusack, but they should have used the script to slap their agents silly on this colossal piece of garbage. One thing I've learned in the past couple of decades of watching every kind of movie is that, if Nikki Cage Coppola is the lead actor AND it's an action film, just stay away. How is this movie such a hit? And how could anyone give it 5 stars?

909711,3,630468150X,"In 1997 when Con Air came out, I must have been drinking more than usual or something.  All these years later I bought the Blu-ray in a lapse towards nostalgia and I was delighted to pop this Jerry Bruckheimer-produced blockbuster in and give it another viewing after an 18 year hiatus.  Now I seem to recall the movie Face/Off came out in the same year and people seemed to like that action-thriller.  That movie was ludicrous  and so is Con Air.  Never before has a movie had such a great cast of actors like Malkovich and Buscemi and Rhames, etc... spanned the realms of the unlikely and unthinkable as much as this movie does.  I was stunned when I rewatched it after so long,  It's amazing what tripe we used to accept.  Then again, in the 70s we watched The Love Boat and The Dukes Of Hazzard, so whatever.  In order to suspend your disbelief, you really need to apply yourself here.  Nicholas Cage is Cameron Poe, Army Ranger badass.  He gets into a fight in the parking lot of a bar where his (barely-pregnant) wife works as a waitress with three white-trash losers.  One pulls a knife and Cameron kills him (the ol' nose-slammed-into-the-brain move).  As his buddies flee, they of course take the switchblade with them, leaving Cameron standing over a white-trash loser's unarmed corpse.  Cameron ends up in court where he receives 7 to 10 years for killing this miscreant because his body has been trained as a deadly weapon.  So many questions.  Who was his lawyer, for one? Do the Army Rangers not pay enough to keep spouses from working in honkytonks and roadhouses?  So Cameron goes to jail where he does nothing but grow hair, rip up his muscles by performing ludicrous exercise techniques, and read books on origami and foreign languages.  Model prisoner.  Writes his wife and his newly born daughter daily.  They never visit him for some reason that is never revealed to us as the viewer.  Then, on the day that he is to be released, he is booked for passage back home on a cargo carrier designed with the criminally masterminded in mind.  Along the way a group of super villains boards the plane for transport to various prisons across the U.S. including one undercover DEA agent posing as a convict.  Of course the convicts, led by Cyrus The Virus (Malkovich), break out and take over the plane.  Meanwhie, Poe is caught in the middle between escape and taking care of his insulin-deficient convict buddy and the captured guards who will surly die terrible, torturous deaths.  Cage keeps his voice southern and wispy.  John Cusack is the prison agent trying to stop them all.  Wow.  There should be an Academy Award category created just for this type of film.  And the winner for this year's Most Convoluted Screenplay goes to....  The scene where they unload Garland Greene (Buscemi) from the back of an armored transport in Dr. Hannibal Lecter-esque fashion is not only hilarious, it's downright preposterous.  I mean they used magnetic poles to clamp onto him and remove him from an over-the-top armored vehicle.  How much do they spend on housing serial killers? It was something straight out of X-men, the really bad one directed by Brett Ratner.  This movie was a box office success and it was stupid.  One of those blockbustery juggernauts where people simply disconnected their brain before watching.  It mad me laugh, and wince, not only at the duex ex machine used throughout, but for Cage's horrible acting.  Just remember, if you have a friend, and that friend lists Con Air in their top ten fav movies, run.  This makes Transformers look like Citizen Kane.  Just saying.  If you like your action and nothing more, here you are.  Otherwise, this movie should only be shown to be mocked.

A couple of drunken bar patrons and an unfortunate turn of events changes all that and Poe ends up with a lengthy prison sentence.

I was expecting a loud, dumb and messy shoot-em up - and it WAS loud and messy, but it was NOT dumb. What is IS is a scathing and VERY moving critique of our so-called criminal justice system.  The script is very smart, Simon West's direction is stunning in the best possible way, and NOBODY plays a bad guy like Malkovich. The rest of the cast is also first-rate and the story is totally believable (until the very end). Cage and Cusak have never been better and the excellent supporting cast of Rachel Ticotin, Mykelti Williams, Dave Chappelle, Steve Buscemi, Danny Trejo and Ving Rames bring it home. I cry every time. CAUTION: this film may be too violent for some viewers.",1410480000,,773,4.514285714285714

910464,5,630468150X,"The beginning of this action-packed movie grabs your attention immediately as we watch prisoners take over the plane, and the action becomes explosive, right up to the end. The dramatic story keeps your attention, and at times, the suspense is intense, because we don't know what will happen next.

Nicholas Cage is at his best, along with the entire cast in a superb acting performance. The story gets better-and-better as we contemplate on who will die, and who will survive. The viewer hopes for a happy ending as we cheer on Nicholas Cage. He winds up with these prisoners because he was in the right place at the wrong time, and even though he committed an act of self defense, his punishment was harsh and he didn't belong with these prisoners.

At the end, we find our hero, and we are satisfied with the outcome. Nicholas Cage not only survives the horrific situation he's in, but he finally gets to bond with his precious family. Entertaining from start to finish. Highly recommended!",1408665600,2,993,4.767441860465116

911073,5,630468150X,"This film is among the better, and consequently, more memorable action films of the 1990s.  While some obvious creative liberties are taken with the source material, it still turned out as a solid film one can enjoy watching.  I could have done without Nicolas Cage's exagerated take on a southern accent (I think he watch ""Forest Gump"" too often) but I'll live.  John Malkovich was as awsome as he always when playing a diabolical villain...wonder how he feels about that type-casting.  Though some might call him ""liberel"" or something synonimus to that, I enjoyed John Cusack's portrayal of the intelligent and enviormentally-aware marshal...he had a good head on his shoulders throughout the film but let a certain amount of emotion slip through his professional facade at just the right moments.  The scenes in Las Vegas (real to a certain extent) were awsome and the film's soundtrack is addictive.  I'd reccomend this to any lover of action movies that still hang on to the value of casting and plot.",1380758400,4,1007,4.964285714285714

911197,4,630468150X,"I do have this film on Standard Def but this will not necessarily be a side  by side comparison.  Never the less, I have seen the film often enough to recall the SD quality.  Enough has been said about the plot, acting, cast and other summaries so I will simply focus on the quality of the actual transfer to Blu Ray.

VIDEO...
  This is definitely an older, albeit no less exciting, popcorn movie but doesn't really look like one.  The film has legs, and even more important, the quality of the transfer from Standard Def to Blu Ray leaves little to be desired. Despite the relatively low Mbps rate which averaged in the low 20's, there is no appreciable grain to crawl and annoy you.  The contrast throughout the film really was excellent and it brought along with it natural and true to  life skin tones.  Color grading throughout the film tended to be on the soft side as there appeared to be no artificial popping of colors.  At no time did I see any artifacts or aliasing in the film and no stair stepping either in the wide angle shots.  The video resolution rates a full 5 stars.

AUDIO...
  Using an uncompressed Dolby PCM 5.1 codec, as this film does, will always produce a more transparent audio field.  While your LFE channel gets and excellent workout with realistic bass tones, your surrounds are not left out either.  There is plenty of front to rear, rear to front panning which places you in the middle of the action.  However, despite the directional use of the front and rear audio stages, the actual audio mix could have been improved as it frequently sounded to my ears as a mash up of all the audio channels rather than discreet one surround foley fx from speaker panning to speaker.  Unfortunately, audio often gets the short stick in the editing suite and the same issue was there for the Standard Definition version.  That said, it is still an improvement over the previous lossy audio found on the SD DVDs.

Extras..
  The same extras that were included on the SD DVD as well as a couple more that were just ok.  Far too many previews of other films make you pay for advertisements rather than donating that disc space to an improved video transfer with a higher Mbps rate and thus even greater video and audio improvement.  Great cast in this film.

All my reviews focus on the quality of the Blu Ray transfer and I do hope this review has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase.

It pretty much begins the downfall of Nicolas Cage, which we can characterize by his getting weirder hairpieces in each film. Cage mumbles his way through the film, staying on this flight of lunatics after they take over the plane. John Cusack is good as a marshal trying to regain control of the situation from the ground, Colm Meaney is delightfully cranky as a federal agent having a bad day, and it's really John Malkovich who makes the film, playing the villain to the hilt and chewing the scenery.",1375142400,,713,4.622047244094488

His superior training and fighting skills helps him to win.  Unfortunately one of the men is killed and the weapon they were going to use on Poe is taken by the other two men.  Cameron is convinced by his attorney to plead guilty and serve 4 years in prison but he is convicted by the judge for 7 to 10 years for manslaughter.

  An army ranger Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) released from active duty gets out and meets his wife at her job at a bar. He is confronted by local drunk customers and ends up killing one of them in self defense. Poe pleads guilty thinking he will do less time and spends ten years in prison.the day of his parole,he is transported in an aircraft with other convicts that have done worse crimes. The convicts have an inside plan on how to get control of the airplane and escape. It is up to Poe and the help of the DEA and US Marshalls to let Cyrus the Virus(John Malkovich) achieve his plan.

  Con Air is a summer movie full of action from all types of weapons,airplanes,hand to hand,vehicles. There is also a lot of comedy involved with the characters,especially the convicts. With a budget of 75 million and a worldwide gross of 224 million worldwide. It is a succesful well appreciated movie. At the time Nic Cage was  barely a leading actor with low budget movies before National Treasure,Face off,Gone in 60 seconds. This was the movie that made him a leading man after The Rock He sports a long hair with a receding hairline looking masculine and only Jean Claude Van Damme's mullet in Hard Target,David Spade's mullet in Joe Dirt can compete. John Malkovich plays an extremely intelligent  villian that has educated himself in prison who is both sarcastic and deadly. Probaby one of his best career performances. John Cusack does well as a bookworm US Marshall who is very intelligent and finds out the prisoners moves. He has been around since the 80s and has done all type of movies like drama,comedy,action. With an all star cast that later their career took off like Steve Buscemi in Boardwalk Empire,Dave Chapelle in Dave Chapelle Show,Danny Trejo in  Machete,Ving Rhames in Mission Impossible movies. Simon West has great editing in cinematography,action scenes and explosions that will give Michael Bay a run for his money. It is not a movie to be taken seriously not 100% realistic but it is almost two hours of great escapism with guilty pleasure fun. Simon West has already wrapped up production in summer of 2012 for the Expendables sequel. Let's see if he is able to top Con Air. The world will find out in August.",1339718400,,2618,4.97254004576659

911747,4,630468150X,"Con Air(released in June/97) features a power house cast in this action-a-minute thrill ride. John Malkovich made himself a household name playing characters that were slightly or way off center and this one shows him off to perfection. The story can sometimes get in the way of the action but overall the film comes through in the end due to Bruckheimers deft touch.
The story involves one Cameron Poe(Cage)an ex army Ranger who gets sent to the Pen defending the life of his wife. Eight years later he is parolled and is heading back home. He is put on a flight with some of the most notorious criminals around and from here things go downhill. Cyrus Grissom(Malkovich)has secretly planned to take over the plane with the help of some of the other inmates aboard. Before they reach their first stop they do so and Poe plays along with the group to buy time and try to get a warning out to the authorities if he can. When they land some of the guards are off loaded as prisoners in a blinding sand storm as is the planes transponder. But a clue left behind by Poe alerts the authorities who unsuccessfully try to stop it at the last minute.
Once back up in the air and now with one especially new rider,a notorious serial killer called Garland Greene(Steve Buscemi),things start to heat up along with some inside bickering. Poe uses this to his advantage and plants another message on a dead body which is pushed out of the plane. It alerts the police to the plane's next stop in a deserted location in the California desert. When the plane arrives the police arrive and a terrible gun battle ensues. Many are killed but the plane still manages to take off.
The police are by now hot on the trail and they track down the plane in the air. They shoot one of its engines and it is forced to make a landing on the Vegas strip. This is a huge transport plane and the damage it does is something to behold. Post crash,Poe has an on going battle with three of the convicts,Grissom included. When it's all over all are dead and Poe is reunited with his family. The one who gets away is none other than the serial killer Greene who is seen at the last sipping on some cool drinks in a casino.
As I said Malkovich plays the crazed convict Grissom to a tee along with a very cold Bescemi doing Greene. Honourable mention goes out to Danny Trejo as serial rapist Johnny Baca,John Cusack as Marshall Larkin and Colm Meaney(also in Deep Space Nine at the time)as DEA agent Malloy. The claustrophobic atmosphere aboard that plane is almost palpable and all play their parts especially well in those scenes.
Technically speaking the film has been transferred well and is in its 2:35:1 a/r. This edition comes with a digital copy(for downloading) and the only other feature here is the trailer.

911818,4,630468150X,"With the constant deluge of new movies being released either in theaters or onto DVD and Blu-ray, it often proves difficult to find the time to revisit older favorites that haven't been watched in quite awhile. This was most recently the case with the 1997 action hit ""Con Air"". I remembered thoroughly enjoying this movie upon its release to theaters 12 years ago, and having re-watched it again, I discovered that I still enjoy it just as much to this day.

""Con Air"" is the story of parolee Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage), a former Army Ranger, who's placed into the middle of an extremely deadly situation when the prison airplane that he's aboard is overtaken by the other prisoners. Now, Poe must overcome seemingly insurmountable odds against some of the worst society has to offer in order to make it home to his family in time for his daughter's birthday.

This movie proudly features all the elements that are crucial for any successful blockbuster action flick. From the relentless pacing, hard-hitting action sequences, clearly defined roles of good and evil, and even a little bit of humor, ""Con Air"" ticked off every box on the action movie checklist. Over the course of the film, the proceedings never felt tired, boring or lacking in entertainment value. Of course, one would expect nothing less when Hollywood's most prolific action film producer, Jerry Bruckheimer (""Armageddon"") is overseeing the project.

Written by Scott Rosenberg (""Gone in 60 Seconds"") and directed by Simon West (""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"") the film moves along at a very brisk pace from start to finish. The execution from page to screen, is that of a smash-mouth actioner that is fully aware of who its audience is and what they expect, all the while delivering in full.

Rosenberg's script would never be recognized as being one of the great dramatic screenplays of our time, not that anyone would expect such an achievement from this type of film. That being said, the script is jam-packed with sharp, quick-witted dialogue and engaging characters that draw you in no matter how depraved they may be. If a writer can make characters that represent the basest criminals of our society interesting, and dare I say entertaining to watch, then everything else should just fall into place. On the flip side, perhaps it's not a good thing to make these types of people entertaining to audiences. Maybe the fact that something like this is acceptable is just another example of how far our society's moral compass has degraded. Either way, that's a debate for another time and place.

In my estimation, for an action film to succeed, it's not enough that there be action aplenty. The characters, be they the heroes or villains, need to be more than merely one-dimensional clichs. There must always be a purpose driving both sides of the movie for it to endure over time with audiences. If there is no drive or reason behind the events unfolding: then, don't bother with releasing the movie to theaters. Instead, let the movie die a slow and painful death alongside the plethora of Steven Seagal movies that no cares to remember. Not to mention, there must also be some element within the various players (primarily the hero or heroes) that connects with the audience enough for us to be willing to go along for the potentially wild ride that lies ahead. In all of this, ""Con Air"" succeeds, which is why myself and numerous others still find the movie just as entertaining after all these years.

Speaking of the characters within this film, they of course would be nothing if it wasn't for the myriad of talent employed to bring them all to life. Leading the cast is Academy Award winner Nicolas Cage (""Leaving Las Vegas"") as former Army Ranger turned unfortunate victim of circumstance, Cameron Poe. Cameron is the epitome of what it means to be a hero no matter the cost. Honestly, he's a borderline clich of stoic heroes past. He's a man whom through training has been honed into becoming the perfect weapon; conversely, he has the proverbial heart of gold and will do anything to protect his friends. Despite the familiarity, Cage portrays Poe as a hero conflicted by his desire to reunite with his family; however, he feels honor bound by his sense of duty to stand his ground against seemingly overwhelming odds. It is this inner-conflict, along with his dry wit and clear compassion for others on display that allows Nic to elevate his role beyond the one-dimensional character he could have been.

The supporting cast of characters is an eclectic collection of talented performers from John Malkovich (""The Man in the Iron Mask"") to Ving Rhames (""Mission: Impossible"") to Steve Buscemi (""Reservoir Dogs""). Each supporting cast member clearly enjoys their time onscreen, especially those portraying the various criminals.

Veteran actor John Malkovich could have gone extremely overboard with his portrayal as Cyrus ""The Virus"" Grissom, a man whom, as described in the movie, ""...is a poster child for the criminally insane."" Yet, Malkovich merely gets to the edge of overacting before reining his performance back in. John delivers a character that is intriguing, disturbed, and above all, devoid of morals. He's a killer without mercy, complete with a sardonic wit that makes you cringe just a little every time you laugh at one of his comments.

Alongside John in the criminal cavalcade are Ving Rhames and Steve Buscemi, as a militant raging against anything and everything and a cannibalistic serial killer respectively. Rhames is entertaining as the man known as Diamond Dog; sadly though, we never really get to see what makes his character tick. Unlike Cyrus, Diamond Dog is relegated to merely playing second fiddle in both the story and as a villain. A little more time with this character could have provided the story with even more depth and intrigue, but we'll have to make do with what we got.

As for Steve Buscemi, what can I say other than the man's physical appearance (perhaps slightly accentuated for the role) is nearly perfect for the deranged serial killer, Garland Greene. His character was one that could have been taken too far into Hannibal Lecter territory, and there is one scene that introduces the possibility; thankfully, Scott Rosenberg had the smarts to not go that route. While taking Garland to that level of evil onscreen would have lent the movie an even more serious tone, the end result would have been detrimental to the film. The decision would have thrust the film into such a dark territory that it could have potentially lost its commercial appeal and resulted in a weaker performance at the box office.

Of course, as is the case with all movies, all of these elements alone cannot make for a thoroughly entertaining experience. To finish the experience, you need a director capable of harnessing all of the loose elements together to create something worthwhile for audiences to enjoy. For this film, former commercial director and first-time film director Simon West (""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"") seemed to be the ideal man for the job.

As a director of TV commercials, Simon undoubtedly knew the importance of grabbing an audience's attention from the get-go and never letting up. A trait which I believe benefited him greatly on this film. Despite his background, Simon seemed to restrain himself from rushing the story along in order to get to the more thrilling aspects of the film. By doing so he allowed the audience time to get to know his characters somewhat before thrusting the proceedings into high-gear. Although, I do wish a little more time could have been spent on expanding upon Cameron's time as an Army Ranger or exploring a few of the other main criminal characters. Even with that slight drawback, the film, as it is, stands far above so many other action films out there.

Finally, ""Con Air"" is an extremely entertaining action film rife with surprisingly entertaining characters, humor, action, and even some drama. If you're a fan of all those crappy Steven Seagal Direct-to-DVD movies (or any of the others that are just like his) then do yourself a massive favor and pop this movie in the next time you feel like watching an action flick.

""Con Air"" is rated R for violence and language.",1261612800,3,8250,4.904659498207885
911819,3,630468150X,"My goodness, is CON AIR lame.  A hulked-up Nicolas Cage (sporting quite the shaggy mane) trying to spit out a southern accent.  An assembly of cons so nasty and mean they put Dante's Inferno to shame.  Steve Buscemi as a mass murderer?  Come on.  Maybe a serial peeping Tom; at least that's more believable.  And a huge Federal transport plane, in flight, suddenly and violently taken over by the inmates.

Really, really lame.

Ridiculous as the entire movie is (with its goofball, over-the-top ending), I still had fun watching CON AIR--primarily because it's mindless violence.  I found myself looking forward to the next death-defying escapade, wondering how director Simon West was going to top the previous madcap shenanigans.  And if you're going to have a cold, brutal, calculating villain (with one of my alltime favorite character names:  Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom), whom better than a smug John Malkovich?  The action is, as mentioned before, fast and furious, with Cage playing a former Army Ranger finally going home to meet his young daughter, only to be caught up in the wrong place at the wrong time and having to duke it out with the bad guys in oh so many interesting ways.  John Cusack plays an ""Aw, shucks"" U.S. Marshal on the ground forever chasing the plane, while Colm Meaney constantly annoys as an arrogant DEA agent.  Everything about CON AIR is so silly you won't be able to believe you just watched it, yet its high octane silliness will make you glad you did.

911821,4,630468150X,"I was suprised by how subtle some of the extended footage was and some of it being not so subtle. The footage certainly adds depth to the storyline, the relationship between Poe and Baby-O and why poe made the choices he did other than ""just"" being a Ranger. While the extended and unrated footage isn't to the extent of say Aliens or Terminator 2 it amazes me how 7 additional minutes can add so much to an already great film.

The bottom line is you've probably seen the movie many times and are wondering if an unrated and extended edition is worth buying the movie again or maybe you don't own it and are asking why not just buy the theatrical version? It seemed to me being unrated it was a bit more graphic, a bit more blood, a bit more violent,and there are many, many more f-boms thrown in including a new great one liner between Cameron Poe and Johnny 23. This is the definitive version of the film.

This is the throw everyting including the kitchen sink edition. The widescreen looks good and clear, the sound is crisp it's an enjoyable film with a great cast, a movie you'd expect to hit theaters with all the other Summer Blockbusters.

However, the only way he can get back is through taking a prisoner ship with all of the baddest criminals in the system, including Nathan ""Diamond Dog"" Jones (Ving Rhames), Cyrus ""The Virus"" Grissom (John Malkovich), Joe ""Pinball"" Parker (Dave Chappelle), and feared serial killer Garland Greene (Steve Buscemi).

John Cusack and Colm Meaney appear as U.S. Marshall Vince Larkin DEA Agent Duncan Malloy, respectively.

Alright so lets take a look at what this movie has:
-  An incredibly awesome cast, check.
-  Some of the greatest special effects committed to tape, check.
-  An excellent score which was worthy of an Oscar nomination, check.
-  A story line that's even remotely realistic or unpredictable... darn, knew it dropped off somewhere.

Truthfully, that's what killed the possibility of me wanting to give it a higher score than what I did.  I know that most action films are supposed to defy the laws of logic, but once Nicolas Cage's character was like ""I'm gonna show you God does exist"" and walks through a wall of gunfire with professional criminals shooting at him, you really can't help but think ""Seriously?  Seriously?!  SERIOUSLY?!?!""

Be that as it may, there was still a lot about the movie to love and it was mostly the cast they had surrounded themselves with.  I mean, Nicolas Cage, John Malkovich, Ving Rhames, Dave Chappelle, John Cusack, Steve Buscemi... these are some of the greatest performers for their respective genres and it's remarkable that such an ensemble cast was put together for an action film.  Throw in some excellent support from Monica Potter, Danny Trejo, Colm Meaney, Mykelti Williamson, and Rachel Ticotin and you've got an effort that the performers should be proud of.  Oh, and the special effects and music makes the ride worth it, too.

912027,1,630468150X,"This movie ranks number one on my top 9 movies list. What could be better than this movie? Nothing. It had an all star cast, and had the most original plot of any movie. No other movie has had a group of convicts hijacking an airplane before (Ignore the movie US Marshalls and a few other exceptions). But honestly, this was the greatest acting performance by Nicolas Cage ever. It is a shame he didn't win an academy award for best actor. And how about that John Malkovich. He played a psycho criminal so well, that if you saw him in real life, you would crap your pants on the spot. Dave Chapelle was wonderful too, playing an all too fitting role of a crackhead, just added to the realism. Then there was Colm Meaney. Everyone knows him from being that guy in Under Siege, and his new upcoming role playing apart from Seagal again in the yet to be released Half Passed Dead (I know good movies, and let me tell you, HPD will be number 6 on my top 9 list, and I haven't even seen it yet). Nobody can forget John Cusack being the anal retentive ""nature boy"" policeman. Ving Rames played a convincing criminal as well. But the greatest character in this movie was Steve Buscemi. Little do you know, but Buscemi was not acting in this movie, he actually is like that in real life.  But enough of the cast, back to the plot. What an amazing scenario, to have the criminals overtake an airplane and try to free themselves with Nick Cage (who is in the Italian-American Hall of Fame mind you) stuck in the middle of all of it. You must watch this movie to see what predicaments the criminals get themselves into, and how Nick Cage, aided by Cusack and Meaney on the ground, tries to thwart their plans. I feel this movie should have won multiple academy awards for best writing. The dialogue between characters, especially Malkovich, was nothing short of phenominal. So while I sit here and write my second comment for this movie, YOU need to go watch it. I guarantee your life will be complete upon seeing this movie.  A Masterpiece.

Nicholas Cage plays Cameron Poe, ex-army Ranger who gets in a bar fight and kills a redneck who was bugging his wife. Poe ends up with a plea-bargained eight-year sentence, does his time without annoying anyone, and is about to be released when he's put on a Federal Bureau of Prisons airplane (known as ""Jailbird-1"")as a convenient ride back to his hometown. The plane is otherwise filled with the worst of the worst convicts from around the country, who are being shipped to a new super-max prison -- and they have no intention of going. John Malkovich does a terrific job as Cyrus Grissom, ringleader of the escape plot, and John Cusack is also very good as U.S. Marshal Larkin, whose plane it is, and who has to try to prevent the escape, and who establishes a tenuous alliance with Poe -- because Poe is the heroic type and he just can't let things happen this way. Steve Buscemi plays a creepy, Hannibal Lector-ish serial killer whom even the other convicts are nervous about, but the screenwriter and the director missed the chance to do a lot more with him as a ""wild card."" (Would he really have sided with the escaped cons in the Big Showdown?) The plot accelerates as it predictably progresses, with the plane finally crash-landing on the Las Vegas Strip (neat SFX, though not really believable). And while you know the Good Guys are going to win, it's interesting to see how they manage it.

It's bursting at the seams with fire, explosions, blue skies and sunshine and never fails to excite.

Jerry Bruckheimer's production style rarely makes a good movie but Con Air is one of those rare exceptions in which all the OTT mayhem and full-on action make a film so exhilarating it scorches when you watch it.

Nic Cage (in a typically bad performance) is Cameron Poe, a US Ranger who is sent to prison for accidentally killing a thug who attacks his pregnant wife. After 8 years of porridge he is freed and hitches a ride home on a prison plane called The Jailbird. But this is no ordinary flight.

On Board are a small army of America's toughest crooks including Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom (John Malkovich) a man on death row for murder, robbery, kidnapping and extortion. Nathan 'Diamond Dog' Jones (Ving Rhames), a black militant inside for murder. Billy Bedlam (Nick Chinlund), inside for killing his cheating wife's family and dog. Pinball Parker (Dave Chapelle), a pimp and drug-dealer. Swamp Thing (MC Gainey) a pilot who knows a few things about a good hijack. And finally Garland Green AKA The Marietta Mangler (Steve Buscemi) a serial killer in for killing a zillion people and crossing 2 state borders wearing a girl's head as a hat.

As you can tell, with such a eclectic bunch of psychos on board it's only a matter of seconds before all hell breaks loose. As soon as the plane is in the air the cons have taken over, restrained or killed the guards and have changed the destination from prison to South America.

Poe, being the good-hearted sort of chap that he is, doesn't rat out as his best pal needs his insulin shot and no one else will help. It's up to Poe to sneakily round up the baddies until US Marshall Larkin (John Cusack) and the cavalry can get there. Easier said than done, as double-crosses, suspicious cons and incompetent authority foul everything up. The result is action overload as the film blazes through to it's anarchic, devastating climax upon another anarchic, devastating climax. At the end you'll be left breathless and your senses stinging with over-stimulation.

Steve Buscemi steals the whole show. His deadpan, bug-eyed and dare I say 'innocent' portrayal of a deranged killer is the centerpiece of the whole film. The scene where he sings with a little girl (and continues later on) will either freak you out or steal your heart. And the ending is the best you could hope for.

Mark Mancina and Trevor Rabin provide a loud, blaring score of thrash-metal and acoustic guitars with the usual Media Ventures flare.

912137,4,630468150X,"Generally I'm not a fan of Hollywood blockbuster action movies. These days they mostly rely on CGI effects, have no characterisation and really are only worth seeing once. Con Air is the exception to that rule. I must have watched this film 7 or 8 times in the first five years after it came out.

The main reason its so watchable is the cast: Nicholas Cage, John Cusack, John Malkovich and Steve Buscemi are all, given the right material, excellent actors. Here they are put to good use. Cage is a US Ranger hitching a lift back in a airbourne jail/transport plane. He's just been released from prison, but don't worry he's a good guy. The rest of the plane is full of the baddest of Americas bad criminals. Some of them, like Buscemi's Garland Greene (an appalling serial killer) are complete fruitcakes and he arrives on the plane in a secure steel box. Buscemi is brilliant. He only has a few lines of dialog in the whole film and steals the acting honours from the rest of the cast. Naturally the plane full criminals escape and all hell breaks loose. Fortunately inbetween the carnage and violence there are also a few nice comedic touches as well, which is relief.

The ending is perhaps the weakest point of the film where it does degenerate into a typical blockbuster movie. Overall though, its great entertainment thats in a different class from most bloated blockbusters. This is a rollercoaster ride you won't want to get off....",1194998400,,1441,4.669291338582677

Yes this is standard Jerry Bruckheimer action fare, but that's not a bad thing.  It's a movie made to entertain and that's it.

912216,3,630468150X,"MOVIE: Con Air, an incredibly loud and in your face action movie that does what it sets out to do. Recently Disney has released a bunch of Jerry Bruckheimer produced ""unrated"" DVD's. Con Air was re-released with Crimson Tide and Enemy Of The State. This so called ""unrated"" edition is nothing but a marketing ploy, but we did need new editions of these Bruckheimer action extravaganzas. Con Air, directed by Simon West, is a flick about a man who is sent to prison after accidentally killing a man during a bar brawl. The opening scene and credits are set to a montage of Cage writing letters to his daughter that was born while he was in prison, and she writes back. So basically it's a narrated reading of the letters back and forth. Okay, we got the character development out of the way in about five minutes, now time for the action. Cameron Poe (Cage) is put on a plane to be sent back home, but he is transported with other hardened criminals. Cyrus The Virus (John Malkovich) has other plans though, and he stages a takeover of the plane. Let the mindless but fun action ensue. Nicolas Cage sports a bad southern accent, long hair, and pumped up biceps and is our protagonist. The movie has some bad dialogue and some cliched scenes, but it never takes itself seriously. We also get Mark Mancina and Trevor Rabin's full blown action score. Mancina and Rabin are members of Hans Zimmer's studio at Media Ventures, and Bruckheimer almost exclusively uses Zimmer or one of the composers that collaborate with him. The score is all electronic based, but it suits the movie well. As for the ""unrated"" material, there is basically nothing. The original running time was 115 minutes, so that makes 7 minutes of added footage. There really isn't anything more in terms of violence and action, just some awkward dialogue scenes that didn't really fit. So, yes, in a way the added footage hinders the movie if that's possible.

ACTING: The movie also has a topnotch cast. Nicolas Cage, who is a favorite when it comes to Jerry Bruckheimer, is great as Cameron Poe the simple southern boy. John Malkovich steals the show as the movie's antagonist. He plays a serial killer yet adds class to the character. John Cusack plays the good cop who is back on the ground trying to handle the situation and believes that Poe is a good guy. So, you see the characters are pretty much cardboard cutouts, but they work. We have some great support from Ving Rhames, Steve Buscemi, and good ol' Dave Chappelle.

VIDEO: The original release came with a non-anamorphic transfer, which is why this release is appreciated. This release comes with an anamorphic 2.35:1 transfer. The picture is sharp, no signs of any major flaws.

AUDIO:The sound mix isn't the best, it's pretty much the same thing from the old disc, a basic 5.1 Dolby Digital track. It's not as spread out as I'd like it to be, but it's okay.

SPECIAL FEATURES: None. When you have no special features, that's a sign that this DVD's only purpose is to sucker in losers like myself into buying them. Oh well, I enjoyed it and don't mind double dipping for a better transfer.

BOTTOM LINE:  They should have just thrown in a featurette or something to at least show some effort was put into it. I feel a little cheated that there is absolutely nothing on this set, especially since the added footage is pretty much crud. For those who don't own it, get this edition. However, if you do own it then don't double dip unless you really liked the movie or if you have a widescreen set that would benefit from the anamorphic transfer. Con Air is your typical mid 90's Bruckheimer actionfest. Nothing here to intrigue your mind, just entertain it.",1147910400,92,3684,4.6339969372128635

The ex-Ranger, as the sentencing judge informs us after Poe refuses to cop a dishonorable guilty plea, is a killing machine.  So Poe is flying home a free man, to see for the first time his seven-year-old daughter.  You see, his still-faithful wife was pregnant when the killing occurred, and Poe wouldn't allow his child to see her Daddy in jail.  Poe is very anxious to see her today.  It's his daughter's birthday and Poe's bringing her a birthday present, a bunny....

  Don't let that touchy-feely stuff worry you too much.  The movie needs a reason for Poe to be in a hurry to get home, and this one works well enough.  The situation turns ugly before the plane leaves the runway.

  CON AIR is an extremely engaging action movie.  The actors are top-notch, including John Cusack as the US Marshal on the ground who believes in Poe and tries to resolve the situation without shooting the hijacked plane out of the air.  The action is non-stop and the dialogue is sometimes startlingly funny.  For instance, at one point one of the bad guys snarls threateningly at Poe ""You know what I am?""  ""Ugly all day"" is Poe's deadpan response.  Add to that a lot of explosions and car crashes, snarly bad guys and good guys too, and a pace that's lifted from a Road Runner cartoon and CON AIR is a hoot.  CON AIR is non-stop, totally improbable, over-the-top, and a whole lot of fun.",1133395200,2,2178,4.611979166666667

They're what takes this film from mediocre to very entertaining, together with the rest of a really fine cast. Gotta admit though, I did snicker when asked what is wrong with serial murderer Garland Greene, Cage replies straightfaced, ""My guess is, a lot"".  Garland is played by one of my all-time favorite actors, Steve Buscemi. John Malkovich does one his finest gigs as master criminal ""Cyrus the Virus"", just ""flowing"" through all his scenes like the professional and good actor that he is. ""Johnny 23"" is wonderfully played by character actor Daniel Trejo. Ving Rhames is not the greatest actor in the world but he is a likable cuss, even as bad guy/bouncer ""Diamond Dog"". This would have been enough but then they throw in agent ""Vince Larkin"" (John Cusack, who is in the classic GROSS POINT BLANKE -- and he's great there, too.)

Personnaly, I generally skip the first few minutes of the movie. Poe (Cage) screwing up and getting thrown in jail. Yawn. Tender scenes with the wife. Another yawn. Let's get to the good stuff. That would be Cyrus' plan to take over the airplane and escape, along with an infamous drug dealer from whom he stands to make a lot of money. It's well done, the characters are interesting, and Buscemi alone is worth the price of admission.

912279,4,630468150X,"As big dumb action films go, it hardly gets bigger and dumber than this.  Yet ""Con Air"" is bursting at the seams with acting talent and a laugh-out-loud script so chock full of classic action film one-liners it makes this movie one of the most rapturous popcorn-munching guilty pleasures since ""Point Break"".  This is a movie that so gleefully revels in its shallowness and perfectly tuned to its adrenaline-craving audience, it can barely afford five minutes to spend on all of the necessary plot setup, dispensing of it easily before the title graphics even appear.  In that five minutes, we learn that Army Ranger Cameron Poe (a musclebound Nicholas Cage) has returned from a tour of duty to visit his lovely wife.  No sooner does he step off the plane and finish a line dance, then he gets into some trouble with some wound-up locals.  They fight, one pulls a knife, and Poe ends up killing him in self defense.  Whoops.  Well, the yokels make off with the knife and Poe gets railroaded into Arkansas federal prison, where he spends his days weaving in and out of Michael Bey-style quick edits, working furiously on his pecs and voice-over narrating sensitive letters to his yet unseen daughter in a ridiculously mannered southern drawl that sounds like Foghorn Leghorn on a morphine trip. After 8 years of prison workouts and bad hair days, Poe is finally on his way home to meet his daughter - that is, until his prison transfer plane is hijacked by the forces of evil.  And mayhem and madness ensues as all laws of sensible plot development are thrown out the window and action movie physics take over.

The ensemble all-star villains cast includes John Malkovich, Ving Rhames, and Steve Buscemi as a Jeffrey Dahmer type, plus sturdy supporting roles for Dave Chappelle and Danny Trejo.  John Cusack and Colm Meaney have a grand time on the ground playing good cop/bad cop as they try to track the runaway jet, while Rachel Ticotin and Mykelti Williamson provide visual confirmation of Poe's conscience as well as distracting semi-perils that our hero must solve.  Director Simon West keeps the action flowing, synched perfectly to Trevor Rabin's noisy industrial-strength action film soundtrack, as Con Air careens from one implausibly over-the-top set piece to another.  This is the kind of movie that could *only* end up crashing a C-130 into the Las Vegas strip.  Are we surprised when the perfectly operational police bike crashes into the back of the firetruck and explodes instantly?  Or seeing an angry Poe taking a gunshot to the arm and not even flinch?  Or how about Malkovich somehow being able to surreptitiously construct an incindiary device in a maximum-security lockdown?  (Of course, i'd say the effete Malkovich has a better chance of the latter, as opposed to giving an freakishly amped-up Cage a good match in a fist fight on a runaway firetruck.)

It always amuses me when sensible people - would-be critic and audient alike - log on to try to throw the believability gauntlet at a hilariously grand spectacle like this.  Is it seriously worth wasting your time expressing indignance about your cinematic sensibilities being ruffled by a Simpson/Bruckheimer production?  Were you expecting Simon West to squeeze out a mini-""Citizen Kane"" before he got to work on ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider""?  ADMIT that you have been entertained.

912280,5,630468150X,"Jerry Bruckheimer's production style rarely makes a good movie but Con Air is one of those rare exceptions in which all the OTT mayhem and full-on action make a film so exciting it scorches when you watch it.

Nic Cage (in a typically bad performance) is Cameron Poe, a US Ranger who is sent to prison for accidentally killing a thug who attacks his pregnant wife. After 8 years of porridge he is freed and hitches a ride home on a prison plane called The Jailbird. But this is no ordinary flight.

On Board are a small army of America's toughest crooks including Cyrus 'The Virus' Grissom (John Malkovich) a men on death row for murder, robbery, kidnapping and extortion. Nathan 'Diamond Dog' Jones (Ving Rhames), a black militant inside for murder. Billy Bedlam (Nick Chinlund), inside for killing his cheating wife's family and dog. Pinball Parker (Dave Chapelle), a pimp and drug-dealer. Swamp Thing (MC Gainey) a pilot who knows a few things about a good hijack. And finally Garland Green AKA The Marietta Mangler (Steve Buscemi) a serial killer in for killing a zillion people and crossing 2 state borders wearing a girls head as a hat.

As you can tell, with such a eclectic bunch of psychos on board it's only a matter of seconds before all hell breaks loose. As soon as the plane is in the air the cons have taken over, restrained or killed the guards and have changed the destination from prison to South America.

Poe, being the good-hearted sort of chap that he is, doesn't rat out as his best pal needs his insulin shot and no one else will help. It's up to Poe to sneakily round up the baddies until US Marshall Larkin (John Cusack) and the cavalry can get there. Easier said than done, as double-crosses, suspicious cons and incompetent authority foul everything up. The result is action overload as the film blazes through to it's anarchic, devastating climax upon another anarchic, devastating climax. At the end you'll be left breathless and your senses stinging with over-stimulation. Con Air is everything an action film should be.

Steve Buscemi steals the whole show. His deadpan, bug-eyed and dare I say 'innocent' portrayal of a deranged killer is the centrepiece of the whole film. The scene where he sings with a little girl (and continues later on) will either freak you out or steal your heart. And the ending is the best you could hope for.

Mark Mancina and Trevor Rabin provide a loud, blaring score of thrash-metal and acoustic guitars with the usual Media Ventures flare. It's brilliant stuff and I suggest you hunt down the (sadly incomplete) score CD. And this really did deserve the Best Original Song award over that pansy Titanic one.

Superior to both The Rock and Face/Off, Con Air is Nic Cage at his (worst) best as an action hero and Bruckheimer at his best as an action producer. See it, for the love of God, see it.

However, the Region 1 DVD is quite crap with no extras and a rubbish 2.35:1 non-anamorhic picture. The Region 2 DVD is anamorphic, with nice motion menus, trailers and some brief featurettes. Get that version if you can.",1121558400,,3081,4.682070240295749

Unfortunately this one stumbles right out of the gate. The whole premise of the movie depends on the audience believing in Mr. Cage's predicament, and I can't.

Supposedly, he has been in prison for years because he, a decorated combat vet, was assaulted by a gang of toughs outside a bar where he had gone to pick up his wife and take her home, and he killed one of them. I don't buy it; not for a minute. Let's say, for the sake of argument, that the creep he killed was the local sheriff's son, and that the local political machine is strong enough to get a conviction. I still have to believe that sometime in the first year the Governor of the state is going to call his good buddy, the Sheriff, and say ""Merle, I know  you loved that no good son of yours, but there's an election coming up. If I don't pardon this guy he's going to be the campaign issue that sinks me. I'm writing a pardon.""

That, or he wins on first appeal. The idea that a combat vet is going to rot in prison for years for defending himself from assault is absurd. It undermines the entire film. It is too much to ask the audience to buy.

Otherwise the movie is no sillier than most of its type. There are some genuinely fine moments, and it is full of great energy. It's too bad the film makers threw away any chance of maintaining my minimal standards of belief for such films in the first minutes.",1115164800,,1503,4.244755244755245

 Rather than delve into the myriad throughly unrealistic events that occur in the film that other reviewers have mentioned - I'll just concentrate on the finale.  The plane full of cons is out of gas and running on one engine just outside Las Vegas - looking for a place to land, Nicolas Cage's character, Poh, and the con pilot claim that they can't make the airstrip and must land the plane on 'the strip'.

912325,1,630468150X,"Few movies can be considered dreadful enough to not have any redeeming charecteristics; this is one of them. Nothing could have saved this movie. I am writing this review in a state of rage, anger, embaressment (of having been seen watching the movie), and pain. So where exactly did this movie go wrong? It had a great cast, an all-star cast if you will. The movie had tons of money to spare, as could be seen by the liberal use of the special effects budget and the enormous sums paid out to the numerous big-name actors. Steve Buscemi was in it, and he is in many good movies. So what is wrong.

First of all, the acting was dreadful. I sensed that every actor was delivering the lines the same way that a hostage reads his ransom note. They seemed to be in constant pain and were probably kicking themselves for accepting such a poor script. The lines were delivered with a lack of coviction and sense of reality.

Now onto to reality; this movie is not reality. The Rock was more realistic than this. Wait...wait Star Wars was more realistic than this. Ok, no biggie. Action films are never supposed to coincide perfectly with realism. However this film goes so far from the laws of physics that it is unforgivable. For example, what happens when a motorcyle crashes into a fire truck? That's right: it explodes. Or what happens when a large transport plain crashes in Vegas? Yep, that's right: it skids for a few miles without going off of the road. Furthermore, nothing was ever explained. How was 'The Virus' able to hijack a fire engine and why didn't anybody stop Poe from getting onto the police bike?

It's pathetic. Steve Buscemi was another problem. I saw the movie looking up for a short period of time when he appeared, then what happens? He has tea with a little girl and she 'reforms' him. I can't think of something more cliche than the child reformer. Oh yeah and children should never be allowed to sing in movies, or at all.

The ending was so overblown and corny that it became completely unwatchable. I understand that I view this differently than most other folks here, but I couldn't bear to see Poe reunited with his family.

The judge decides that Cage, as an ex Ranger should know better than to use his considerable fighting skills on worthless drunks and sends him away. During his prison term his daughter is born, whom he refuses to let visit, but collects ALL of her pictures and letters whilst incarcerated. He also beefs up, grows his hair long, and acquires a stack of white vests, to help show off his physique.

Of course, the plane is packed with the worst criminals imaginable (including a darkley comic cameo from Steve Buscemi) from across the whole country, we assume all going to some maximum security country club somewhere. I don't want to be harsh about this pure escapist way way over the top action, but it's a lot of fun, and feasible (if highly unlikely) for the most part. John Cusack is excellent as the ""sensible"" US Marshal on the ground, and Colm Meaney (Star Trek TNG) plays his complete opposite ""lets kill em all"" DEA Agent, trying to get the plane and cargo back. There's enough explosions, chases, and fights to keep most fans of this sort of thing happy for weeks, and the acting is actually very good and believable all round. The main problems are the Director seemingly not knowing when to end the movie (after several finale opportunities), and a lack of any real depth or character development (but then consider the type of movie for a second). The ""never leave a man behind"" code that Cage's character constantly bombards the audience with is also a little too cliched for my taste, but all that said, it IS a good picture. Predictable?

Credit the actors for doing something with their roles, especially the brilliant John Cusack who puts his teeth into his meaty role as a US Marshall.  Also Colm Meaney as the DEA agent who is obstinate and overbearing, to say the least.  There are a nasty set of villains--John Malkovich, Nick Chindlin, Ving Rhames, Danny Trejo, David Chappelle---a nice looking guard played by Rachel Ticotin, another good bad guy played by Mykel Williamson, and Monica Potter does a nice turn as Poe's wife.  Nicolas Cage is so bland, saddled with a ridiculous Southern accent, and does so many stupid things, it's hard to see how we can consider this guy that heroic.

John Cusack is our other main good guy, Larkin, the US Marshall whose job is to sort things out after assorted super-criminals take over a prisoner transport `plane. And sorting things out is not really that difficult as these particular baddies are really not all that smart and their plan is, let's face it, pretty half-baked. So to make it difficult the writers responsible for this tosh have compelled him to work alongside gung-ho DEA official Malloy (Colm Meaney). Now there are lots of stories and movies that get good drama about the working relationship of two professionals with interestingly different approaches to their work. But this isn't one of those movies. Here the main difference is that Larkin is smart and responsible while Malloy is a complete pillock.

Malkovich was truly evil in the role of the cold blooded killer, Cyrus the Virus. Ving Rhames(You'll remember him as Luther Stickel in Mission: Impossible) was funny and frightening as Diamond Dogg.

Still, there are a few details that keep it from being perfect. For instance, the accent that Nicolas Cage uses is absolutely horrible. The fact that his voice is so bad even takes away from the fact his hair is annoyingly long. And had Nicolas not been supported by the actors John Malkovich and John Cusack, it would've been a nightmare. Malkovich is particularly enjoyable as he plays the ""bad"" bad guy; Cage is a criminal in the movie, but he's wrongfully accused. There's also great appearances by Steve Buscemi, Dave Chappelle, and Ving Rhames; all as convicted felons. Many Buscemi enthusiasts will say this film features his best role. And that's with good reason. You have to see his character to believe it.
Here Cage plays Cameron Poe, who as I said, was convicted under false pretenses. As he's traveling on a plane filled with criminal after criminal, the character of Cyrus ""the Virus"" (Malkovich) and co. begin to take over the plane. If you think it sounds stupid, it's really not. Poe sums it up perfectly in saying they managed to get every bad criminal in the world onto one plane. Even though it seems to be a far-fetched cry for originality, it works well for the movie. On a down note, they (the director) never really clue us into how the plane was hijacked. It just sort of happens. There's no real plan, and it's basically through force and violence. It's really a weak script, but the acting of the individuals and as a group make up for that. I don't want to spoil anything for you, so I won't say much more. Once the group takes control of the aircraft, they obviously plan to head to Mexico (this is very clich). Another person who helps add appeal to 'Con Air' is Monica Potter. She plays the wife of Poe; and even though her role is rather small, it's one of the best. This probably helped boost her career and get her roles in both 'Along Came A Spider' and 'Patch Adams'. She plays the part of a apprehensive wife (with a child who's never seen her father) to complete perfection. As I have said I won't ruin anything else for you, I won't ruin the ending either. But I will say it was a very poor ending. If it weren't for the ending, this would have been a 5-star movie. I have a hard time understanding how other reviewers could enjoy the ending to that great of an extent. Even so it's not terrible, yet it's nothing to write home about.
At the end of the day, this movie is definitely worth watching. A lot of Nicolas Cage fans will probably love this movie; maybe even say it's their favorite. 'Con Air' sits at #28 on my listmania list for my top 100 movies of all-time; and it's slightly better than 'The Rock'. Don't let my views on the end or Cage's voice lead you to believe this is not a great movie, because it is. The cast is one of the best I've ever seen in an action movie. Many of the characters bring their own assortment of jokes and/or seriousness to the film. Mainly Steve Buscemi; whose role here makes this an essential for his many fans. There are certainly some parts that don't allow this movie to be 5 stars. But on the other hand, there are certainly countless aspects that make it better than just four; I'd label 'Con Air' as a 4.25-star movie.

912462,2,630468150X,"I love action films, but as I was watching Con Air, I kept asking myself, ""where's all the action?""  Apparently, director Simon West decided he'd hold off the typical gun fights, car chases, and big explosions until the last half-hour.  Big mistake.  This is a Jerry Bruckheimer production, and I don't expect to have to wait 90 minutes to get to the action, which even then, is extremely disappointing in how routine all of it turns out to be.
So, instead, it might be more applicable to view this as a comedy about a relatively simple situation that goes awry.  After all, this whole mess begins when an army ranger named Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) defended his pregnant wife and killed a man.  Even though he was just defending himself and his wife and pleads guilty, he still gets the maximum sentence because he's seen as a ""deadly weapon"" in the judge's eye.  It's too bad Cage, normally a pretty good actor, plays his role like a mix between Elvis and Forrest Gump, and as if to make the latter more obvious, Poe's best friend is none other than Mykelti Williamson, AKA Bubba!
This Poe Fella and his buddy manage to get on board a plane full of the most dangerous criminals alive, who come up with an escape plan despite them having never even set foot on the plane before.  Poe has to try and thwart them, and this goes on for pretty much the entire movie.  So what we have here is a film with a lame protagonist, even lamer villains, and average action scenes that don't get the pulse pounding.  Oh, yeah, and there's constant bickering between John Cusack and Colm Meaney over whether or not to shoot the plane down.  The answer should be a no-brainer, but since that description fits the movie itself, you can guess what they decide to do with the plane.
I get a lot of amusement over the family reunion in the movie's final scenes, where Poe meets his wife and his daughter, who he's never seen before.  This was definitely the film's funniest bit, and I'm not sure whether or not it was meant to be.
(Spoiler) Take a look at the scene where Malkovich's villain is killed.  It's pretty obvious he falls in such a position so that his feet, and not his head, would be facing that crushing machine.  This is the kind of haphazard editing that's displayed throughout the whole film, so it's of no surprise Simon West would go on to direct Lara Croft: Tomb Raider, the worst film of 2001.  Hey, I actually see that as a good thing, since it kept West from directing Black Hawk Down, which was, ironically enough, the best film of 2001.",1027728000,,2543,4.476190476190476

And Cusack has great persuasion in screaming into phones which he does a lot. But no matter the action is terrific with pumped up soundtrack to help it stay together.

Unsurprisingly, the cons have a plan to escape and take over the plane, and Nic Cage has to try and stop the crims and get home alive. It's all very predictable and silly, but with a premise like this one, you're not excactly expecting Shakespeare. And this is one of those high-octane action flicks like The Rock (1995), where the relentless action set-pieces paper over the plot holes. Said action is excellent  with great stunts, a sharp script and some witty one-liners from Buscemi.

The great musical score and star lineup make this really stand out. Explosions, and great comedy bits make this a highly rewatchable movie. Dave Chapelle, Colm Meaney, Steve Buscemi, and M.C. Gainey steal the scenes.
As far as action movies go, it's hard to find a fault with this movie. My only nitpick would be that it's hard to really believe Cage's southern accent. It easily tops other similar movies like Armageddon, Face/Off, and The Rock. You can't go wrong - watch it!

912495,4,630468150X,"Well, Con Air is an action film. There's no escaping that. And when the name Jerry Bruckheimer pops up in the opening credits, we know it's going to be a big action film in every sense of the word.
Cameron Poe (Nicolas Cage) is a retired US Ranger who, the day of his return, gets involved in a drunken brawl protecting his wife from some local thugs, accidentaly killing one of them during the scuffle. It's not long before he's convicted and sent to prison for his crime.
Determined not to screw up again, Poe spends the next five years or so growing his hair and doing push-ups, from what we see in the opening shots. Eventually he gets paroled and he and his friend, Baby-O are brought on board The Jailbird - a lumbering troop transport designed to fly prisoners around the country.
But they are not alone on this aircraft. Onboard are an assortment of master criminals and general nutters from all over the country. There's super-clever Cyrus the Virus (a shaven-headed John Malkovich), black militant Diamond Dog (big bloke Ving Rhames), serial rapist Johnny 23 (greasy Danny Trejo) and creepy mass murderer Garland Green (Steve Buscemi).
Needless to say, it's not long before the cons break out and take control of the aircraft. With Baby-O dying from lack of insulin, Poe is forced to remain on the aircraft and try somehow to get things under control. On the ground, Federal Marshall Vince Larkin (John Cusack) does his best to calm things down and work out just how the hell to stop the whole thing turning into a bloodbath.
The plot isn't anything spectacular, but at least it's better than the likes of Armageddon. The first two-thirds of the film are relatively slow, with Poe skulking around the aircraft and generally doing his best to help the good guys without getting himself killed.
It's only in the last half-hour that the film succumbs to the inevitable Bruckheimer influence and disintegrates into an orgy of guns, explosions and even a bit of fist-fighting. Still, the action sequences are solidly staged and competently shot, particularly the battle in the deserted airfield.
The only real problem is that the film just doesn't know when to stop. After crashing an aircraft into the heart of Las Vegas, we're then treated to a fire truck chase through casino's, tunnels and even construction sites, resulting in a totally over-the-top death for the villain. The film reaches a high with the airplane crash, but it keeps going for more and by the time Cyrus is finally disposed of, it comes as an anti-climax.
The performances are good rather than great. Malkovich, since his performance in The Line Of Fire, has become the new Alan Rickman - a thinking mans bad guy. He's always ready with a sarcastic remark or witty postulation and he certainly looks nasty enough, but he doesn't really have the presence to carry off the role.
Cage turns in a solid performance as all round good-guy Cameron Poe, but after the likes of The Rock and Face/Off, this film certainly doesn't push his limits as he mumbles his way through his simple-Simon dialogue. Still, he seems to have put in some hard time at the gym for this movie, and wastes little time on showing off his new physique.
The rest of the actors are there mostly as cannon fodder or comic relief. John Cusack does what he can in what is really quite a limited role, while Steve Buscemi turns in one of his patented 'Creepy little guy' performances, still managing to raise a few laughs with his occasionally insightful remarks.
The soundtrack for Con Air is top class, perfectly summing up the mood of the film. There's a lot of heavy bass whenever one of the villains strolls up (usually in slow motion) and plenty of electric guitar during the fight sequences. The dialogue is rather intermediate, mostly witty and entertaining, but occasionally flat and dull. At least most of the puns are good. Upon seeing a sports car hanging in the air behind their plane, Poe remarks simply, ""On any other day, that might seem strange.""
All in all, a good movie with some interesting and stylish touches. Above average, but not a classic.",1004832000,4,4106,4.744055944055944

Nic Cage has proven to be a good actor in the past, but his Forest Gumpesque accent in this movie makes him sound like a retarded cowboy.  He looks tired in every single scene and tends to drag down whatever realism is left over.  However, the rest of the actors in the film are very good.  John Malcovick oozes evil and is a very good calm-bad guy.  John Cusack also resonates well, as does Ving Rhames and Steve Buscemi.  In fact, Buscemi eats the entire movie in every single scene he is in.  He's menacing in a very sweet way, if that's at all possible.
Plot also doesn't have much to do with the movie.  It's a reason to give a lot of gunshots, blood-squirts, and explosions.  I really have never seen some of the so called ""plot-twists"" that my fellow reviewers said this film contains, but once again, plot doesn't matter in a movie like this.  Simon West's direction is routine at best and never truly moves into anything original at all.  Go watch The General's Daughter if you want to see a better film by West.
Despite all of these horrible aspects of the film, Con Air is extremely entertaining in a juvenile way.  West and Co. blow up things real good and the supporting cast makes for some entertaining lines.  While I'm talking about lines, let me just say the whole ""Bunny"" subplot is perhaps the dumbest thing I have ever seen in a modern action movie.  Every time the bunny makes an appearance on screen, I cringe.
But like I said, the movie is just so damn entertaining that every bad thing in it is overshadowed.  The pacing is great, and that is truly what saves this movie from being just horrible.

912571,5,630468150X,"""Con Air"", along with a few other recent extravaganzas from the powerhouse production duo Simpson-Brukheimer, is a very slick piece of goods with extremely high production values. Nic Cage (speaking in a sonorous southern twang) plays the role of the embattled ex-con, Cameron Poe, who is on the way to his wife and daughter, on a plane carrying a quirky, surreal bunch of convicts. These include Diamond Dog (Ving Rhames), a black militant and his accomplice, Cyrus ""The Virus"" Grissom ""who claims to have killed more men than cancer"" (played by the brilliantly seedy John Malkovich). The cons manage to hijack the plane and Poe (who is small fry compared to the other convicts, since he had only pleaded guilty to manslaughter after a violent drunken brawl) finds himself pitted against the homicidal jailbirds in the struggle for power. The superb, eloquent dialogue (penned by Scott Rosenberg) features some of the most hilarious tough-guy rejoinders and put-downs. ""Con Air"" is an action film that would appeal to even those who hate action films, even though it contains enough death and destruction to recommend it to the ""Die Hard"" crowd.",971740800,2,1146,5.068783068783069

Sadly, many people will probably first read the reviews of this excellent film, and only pick it up when looking for a brainless action-fest.  I think it has gotten to the point where most hollywood critics dismiss movies with high-budget stunts as having nothing else to offer.  Con Air definately does.  While maybe not boasting an all-star cast, the actors featured are definately at the top of their trade, and you'll recognize them from many other features.  Nicholas Cage was, as always, amazing, though he didn't really take control of the camera this time.  Colm Meaney and John Cusack had their own impressive side to the plot, as well as the many wonderfully deep characters who played the convicts.  Ving Rhames and Steve Buscemi stood out to me, but there was no sub-par acting.  When it comes to music, there was an excellent score that accurately portrayed the emotion of each scene.  Whether it be a bloody action sequence or the emotional re-uniting of Cameron Poe (cage) and his wife, Con Air delivers.  For what the movie is branded as, Con Air has some of the biggest and loudest stunts and action sequences.  You won't fall asleep while watching it.  There is quite a bit of humor inserted throughout the film that may be a bit of a cliche at times, but is totally hilarious when breaking up some of the more stressful scenes.  5 out of 5.

This  movie is soooo incredably funny!  If you really like action movies this is  definately for you!  Even if you don't it has some great lines in it.

I mean really, people like movies  such as Air Force One, The Matrix and STAR WARS (oh, theres a big one) who  are also very, very, very unlikely.  So don't bad mouth Con Air for being  unlikely because almost every other movie is too!
Con Air is really  addictive, I think this has something to do with the stunts, funny scenes,  but probably most of all is the music.  Most soundtrack scores aren't done  with an electric guitar, Con Air is.  It makes the movie powerful and  original.

John Cusack is in good form as  U.S. Marshal Vince Larkin, who owns the plane the criminals take over,  named ""the Jailbird"". Nicolas Cage delivers one of his best  performances as Cameron Poe, a decorated military hero who is catching a  ride home after being in prison for 8 years for defending his wife in a bar  fight. Other good performances were by Steve Buscemi as serial killer  Garland Greene and Ving Rhames (Mission:Impossible) as Nathan ""Diamond  Dog"" Jones. The musical score was very good. There are a few plotholes  but hey, there aren't too many movies that don't have a few plotholes here  and there. Another good thing is action. Most of the action on board the  plane is hand-to-hand combat. Probably the best action scene in the movie  is where the criminals stop to get a new plane. U.S. troops attack them in  a long and great gunfight. The other action sequence is when Cusack and  Cage chase Cyrus on motorcycles through a tunnel in Las Vegas. It is very  humorous when the plane is crashing and Garland Greene is singing  ""He's got the whole world in His hands"". At the Academy Awards  Con Air was nominated for two things:Best Sound and Best Original Song. It  did not win either.

912707,5,630468150X,"Okay, so maybe this one will never win the Academy Award for ""Most Logical Picture."" But for plain old-fashioned-get-your-adrenalin-pumping fun, this movie is hard to  beat.
The premise is utterly ridiculous. Nicholas Cage plays Cameron Poe,  an Army Ranger sent to a Maximum Security prison for killing a  knife-wielding punk while protecting his pregnant wife (Monica Potter, who  lights up the screen just by being there). At the end of seven years Poe is  paroled and is placed on a transport flight home.
Uh-oh! The transport  flight passenger list reads like a phone directory for Sociopaths R Us. The  entire flight is filled with urban guerrillas, serial murderers, and  chain-rapists. What lunatics could write a script where this collection of  megalomaniacs is able to work together in hijacking the plane?  Well,  they're out there.  So be afraid. Be very very afraid.
Parolee Poe then  forgets his beautiful young wife and little girl, but recalls that he is  the lone Ranger on the flight. Spurning a chance to escape so that he can  stick by his best friend and a lady guard who is about to become the  in-flight entertainment, Poe wins the trust of ringleader Cyrus The Virus  (John Malkovich), even while sabotaging the Great Escape.  Malkovich is  appropriately psychotic and has some of the best lines in the picture.
The resourceful Poe is able to convince Federal Agent Larkin (John  Cusack) that he wears a white hat, (how is another matter) but Cusack has  problems of his own with Agent Malloy (Colm Meany, who should win the Most  Abrasive Actor Oscar for this or any picture).  Larkin and Malloy chase the  hijacked plane across the country in a high speed hyperactive romp of  exploding humvees, flying sportscars and ground-attack helicopters, but  don't catch up to the plane until it crash lands in Las Vegas after Poe  subdues most of the Bad Guys. Of course, ah yes, ultimately he must subdue  the Worst Guys.
Does it sound beyond belief?  Well, it is.  But it's  also two hours and some of rollicking screen hysteria.  If you like the  action genre, you will love CON AIR.  If the genre doesn't appeal to you,  this most definitely won't.

It requires a few days to fully come to grips with how fine a film it is, how the characters stay  with you, how scenes and dialogue may haunt you for days.
I would like to  use this theory in the reverse;  that you cannot truly appreciate a bad  film for many days afterwards.  At first, you are simply annoyed at having  spent two hours of your life in the futile search for entertainment.  But  over the next few days, you begin to truly loathe the experience.  So it is  with CON AIR.
CON AIR is the worst mainstream film I have seen in a  decade, a film so devoid of any ideals other than to make money that it is  downright obscene.  Now, I don't have a problem with mindless  entertainment.  I heartily enjoyed FACE/OFF, which I saw the week after  this.  But where FACE/OFF was a skilled display of mayhem, CON AIR is an  ugly, disjointed, and often vile piece of dreck.
The characters are, at  the best boring, and at the least hidesouly insulting stereotypes.  The  action is pathetic, and only exist to service the notion that a big  explosion is far preferable than any real emotion or actual  acting.
Speaking of acting, everyone involved reaches career lows.  Nicholas Cage is simply unwatchable.  Steve Buscemi is boring.  John Cusack  is lost.  And John Malcovich wastes his career away.  There was no  consideration given by any actor here other than the opportunity to earn a  paycheck.
The directing is hideous.  Simon West proves himself unable to  bring forth even the slightest hint of real empathy for his characters, and  shows only contempt for the audience.  His opening scene, where Cage fights  for the love of his wife, is the funniest scene put to film since THE NAKED  GUN.  Unfortunately, West did not intend it this way.

7875346,3,630468150X,"I don't understand how to review this.  The movie, OK , I like the actors (as long as he doesn't get Political).  The DVD itself, I won't know until I watch it (right now it's on my DVD shelf).  If I were to watch it and the DVD itself is fine, that is no guarantee that ALL of the other DVDs that people may buy will be OK.  Just like the majority of reviews, some say it is great and some hate it.",1521676800,,399,3.7710843373493974
