5848487,3,B00DRCYAK4,"This was by far the weakest of all the seasons.  And there is no wrap-up type episode or anything so that leads me to believe that the show was canceled after the season was fully shot and in the can.  I would think they could have figured out some way to do a wrap-up / thank you episode to close things out and share their thoughts on the show coming to a close after 7 seasons. Oh well....the series is done now and even though it was a scripted reality show (the only one I have ever watched actually - could not resist being a lifelong KISS fan), I did enjoy many of Gene's nuggets of wisdom.  It was a fun ride.  Keep in mind - the rating system of Amazon states that a 3 star rating means: ""It was ok"".  This final season was not great or even all that good, nor was it awful. It was simply ""ok"" in my mind.",1383350400,2,814,3.9693251533742333
5848488,5,B00DRCYAK4,"I can hardly wait for the new season, if it is half as good as last season it will be great.",1377734400,2,92,3.4285714285714284
5848489,1,B00DRCYAK4,"This is the worst season of the show. It has totally went down hill. I don't like this, and will not be worth buying.",1374278400,5,117,3.9166666666666665
5848490,4,B00DRCYAK4,"I'm enjoying every episode of the final series. The only gripe I have with the show, is the annoying psychiatrist, Dr Ann Wexler, Gene & Shannon go and see. Half the shows are spent in her office. Other than that, I'm loving the show. Sad that it had to end.",1427932800,,258,4.18

5848493,5,B00DRCYAK4,"What can I say that hasn't already been said.
a true legend. Mr. Gene Simmons is a very smart man, knows how to live the American dream and has a beautiful family to boot! I have loved him since the 70's. had to complete my collection with this DVD.",1410566400,,249,4.1020408163265305

5848496,5,B00DRCYAK4,I haven't seen another reality show that keeps me as entertained as this one does. It's really funny and a must see from start to finish.,1403913600,,137,4.3076923076923075
5848497,1,B00DRCYAK4,"As the series edged towards upset and drama in season 6, the series starts to become tense and difficult to watch. While the sixth season had a few powerful moments, the seventh season is unnecessary. The DVD offers fine audio/video quality, although little in the way of extras. Not recommended aside from fans who are looking to complete their collection of the series. Speaking of that, given Gene's history of marketing products, I'd be surprised if there was not a whole series set in a giant Kiss-themed box and somehow the discs - which are top-loaded - roll down a giant tongue.",1391904000,,586,4.754901960784314
5848498,5,B00DRCYAK4,"You an your family are so real (dn to earth) & yal have raised your kids with good values . I adore your family because they show true emotions as most reality shows don't unless it's outrageously ridiculous, I have thoroughly enjoyed getting to know all of you . It's really nice to know being as rich as yal are there is no arrogance . I am extremely impressed by your kids mortals an happy to see an feel the Love , humor an sincerity of your close knit family. I've always been a KISS fan but after watching your family show an seeing the real side of you & yours , well I'm just in awe of you & family !!! Hope all of yal are doing Fantastic . With Greatest Respect & Love , Janet W.

5848499,3,B00DRCYAK4,"Perhaps overstaying it's welcome a little, the series is a must for Kiss fans, but maybe not for others.  Has some entertaining moments, but clearly the sow has run it's course and the novelty factor of watching Simmons in his natural (scripted) habitat has worn a little thin.",1384992000,2,277,4.770833333333333

8596600,4,B00DRCYAK4,Well this was a fun series until season 4 or 5 then it got real for gene when his sex tape came out. And Shannon became crazy. This last season was good in places but a downer for most.,1485129600,,185,3.769230769230769

8596604,5,B00DRCYAK4,I have enjoyed the entire series and appreciate the family for being able to expose them selves and there real life problems. The marriage boot camp showed a side of Gene that im sure gave him personal healing thank you Simmons family,1441324800,,234,4.595238095238095

8596607,2,B00DRCYAK4,"I loved Gene Simmons Family Jewels when it was on tv, watched it every time it was on but then had to work alot and missed the final season. I just got the DVD and was sooooo disappointed! The kids acted like snotty rich brats! Shannon wanted to possibly adopt a child and Nick and Sophie, instead of  discussing this intelligently, they cocked this attitude and gave her the silent treatment. You had a mom almost in tears trying to talk to her children and they would ignore her calls and texts and would tell her ""I'm not talking about this now"". I was amazed! Who wants to watch that trash! The shows in season 7 are un-watchable! No one wants to see some rich punks who their whole life had everything handed to them and act so disrespectful! I don't know what happened between seasons 1- 6 and 7, but the whole demeanor of the show changed. Maybe Gene wanted to end the show and this was the way to do it. He should have screened these  episodes before they aired and said no way and re-shot some new ones with a more positive attitude for the show, it would prob still be around today had he done that. What a HORRIBLE ending to such a great show!",1431129600,2,1154,4.264840182648402
