3643816,4,B001HSAPX6,"If you are looking for a different type of Pirate movie including vengeful ghosts and a touch of satanic ritual thrown in, then this is for you.  Rollin approaches another genre and fills it with his artistic flourishes and stunning imagery.  Again, Redemption's print is a cut above the Image Entertainment release. No sword duels or scenes of derring do in this outing, instead Rollin paces the film like a pressure cooker billowing out his sordid tale of revenge in slow jarring jolts.  Recommended.",1274572800,6,502,4.9523809523809526
3643817,4,B001HSAPX6,"Jean Rollin makes movies that perplex 'movie viewers' - his films are always poetically surreal, hypnotic, absorbing, enchanting and hallucinatory, and almost never have a coherent storyline. This frustrates and alienates a good deal of viewers, while attracting others. His flix are about dream-like imagery unfolding, cascading in waves, nightmarish and bizarre. He's done away with the notion of a narrative or a linear storyline in favor of the visuals allowing the viewer to interpret as the viewer sees fit. But it's not traditional horror. Highly unconventional, I understand why most people don't enjoy his movies as well as why others are attracted to them. I've seen almost all of his flix and find something worthwhile in most of them while my wife hates them. Different strokes...

The other reviewer is too harsh on this film, expecting gore and nudity to suffice as entertainment. Don't get me wrong, I love exploitation in all its forms, but am one of the few who enjoys an Art House flick as well, and if we can incorporate both in one film, I'm in heaven, while most of my exploitation brethren are bitchin' and moanin'. There's enough nudity to keep most interested, especially the scene where the female leader of the vulgar ship wreckers masturbates on the beach while watching her cruel and sadistic followers brutally rape and kill two girls who re-emerge later on as spectres after making a pact with the devil. Have I got your attention yet?",1273536000,14,1465,4.955284552845528
3643818,2,B001HSAPX6,"This film was garbage, plain and simple. It did not have the gore to make up for its weak story line. It did not have enough sex to make up for its lack of gore. There was not enough nudity to shock in place of gore and sex....YIKES!

I guess I am twice as bitter, because I bought this DVD sight unseen. It does not even have any camp value. The closest thing I can compare it to is an ABBA video gone horribly awry.",1242950400,3,417,3.9058823529411764
3643819,5,B001HSAPX6,"Wow. I don't think i've ever seen a movie like this. Crappy acting, crappy story, crappy everything. The only way you can watch this movie is to watch it with a group of friends. That will make the movie more enjoyable. Have a blast!",1163980800,4,233,4.318181818181818
3643820,1,B001HSAPX6,"Jean Rollin is a name instantly recognizable to hardcore horror fans, yet meaningless to nearly everyone else. This ignorance is quite unfortunate because the French director concocted some of the sleaziest, most unusual films ever made during the 1970s and 1980s, films usually imbued with a disturbing mix of hypereroticism and bloody violence. I have often tossed Rollin's name around with aplomb in impolite company even though I had never seen even one of the man's films. You read enough plot synopses about someone and you start to feel as though you know every intimate detail about their work. What I did hear from others about this director oftentimes did not bode well. He is apparently well versed in schlock filmmaking, which in and of itself is not a problem with me, a true lover of bad cinema, but several of his films continue to draw raves from a selected minority of genre fans. Well, I finally sat down with a Jean Rollin film, his 1979 effort ""Fascination,"" and was pleasantly surprised with the results. As I viewed the film with a growing sense of intrigue, I began mentally composing a list of other films from this director that I should watch in the near future. After watching the phenomenal ""Living Dead Girl,"" I finally stumbled over one of the man's turkeys. It's called ""The Demoniacs.""

A cheesy introduction aimed at setting the background of the film introduces us to a crew of bloodthirsty pirates called Wreckers. Why the nickname? Because these dolts scavenge for treasure amongst ships washed up on the shore. This particular band of cutthroats is led by The Captain (John Rico), a sweaty buffoon who looks like he's trying to do an impression of Marty Feldman all the time. The Captain, the voice over tells us, is a ruthless leader suffering under frequent visitations from the ghosts of his myriad victims. Another crewmember is Bosco (Willy Baque), a wiry, laughable looking thug with a nasty temper. My favorite member of this comedy troupe...er, pirate gang is Tina (Joelle Coeur), a gorgeous brunette who shucks her clothes at the drop of a hat when she isn't ordering an innocent person's execution. The final member of the Wreckers is a guy whose name I forget but who looks like Mike Nesmith from The Monkees. These criminals are quite terrifying if you can stop laughing long enough. In fact, if this is the best France can offer up in the pirate department, it's no wonder their military forces lost every important war in the last two hundred years.

The biggest problem with ""The Demoniacs"" is that nothing of interest ever happens. Sure, you've got the Wreckers out plundering when they chance upon a pair of survivors in the form of two blonde girls in white shrifts. And you've got the Wreckers throwing the two gals around and generally acting rude. Then we see the gang in a local bar, where The Captain lurches around in one of his ""I see dead people"" shticks. There's also a lady at the bar whose psychic abilities often find her issuing cryptic observations to anyone who will listen. But it's just enough to raise the pulse. Then the movie shifts focus. ""Ahhh,"" I think, ""Jean Rollin will finally deliver the goods!"" Yeah, right. Instead, he has the two girls discover a deserted island with some ancient ruins staffed by a girl dressed as a clown (!), a Rasputin look-alike with none of the charm of the original (!!), and what can only be Satan with a '70s bouffant wearing tacky clothing (!!!). The two young victims strike some deal with the devil that results in them receiving his powers for an evening so they can seek revenge against the Wreckers. This subsequent revenge is about as interesting as watching a coat of paint dry, laying down a second coat, and then watching that one dry as well. Jean Rollin, why hast thou forsaken me?

I suspect Jean Rollin was attempting to make a horror picture that would make the audience think, and it did--it made me think about how much I wanted to get away from the television screen! I'm almost certain the clown, the Rasputin wannabe, and Satan carried some symbolic importance, some message Rollin wished to get across to the audience, but I couldn't care less what that message is. Even the director's usual indulgences--specifically, a huge amount of nudity--failed to rescue this film from the depths of banality. The worst mistake Rollin made was leaving out the gore. I could deal a lot better with the wooden acting, the laughable dialogue, the cheesy set pieces, and the lame chase scenes if I knew I would see some sauce once in awhile. Alas, such is not to be. A guy dropping a bottle on his head? A few gunshots? Nope, not nearly exciting enough to warrant watching the picture.

The best thing about ""The Demoniacs,"" sad to say, is the Redemption DVD intro tape at the beginning of the film. If you've seen a Redemption disc before, at least one in the Jean Rollin Collection, you know what I'm talking about. As for this disc in particular, extras include the requisite Rollin filmography, a trailer, and several different types of publicity stills. The picture transfer is excellent. While I haven't even begun to scratch the surface of Rollin's copious film history, ""The Demoniacs"" is the worst one I have seen, a film truly deserving of a one star review. What a disappointment after watching ""Fascination,"" ""Living Dead Girl,"" and to a lesser extent ""Lips of Blood."" I'll continue onward with my Rollin expeditions, but I hope the next few entries are vastly superior to this dead end.",1093392000,17,5517,4.7677824267782425

3643828,4,B001HSAPX6,"This is my favorite Jean Rollin film which is not to say he doesn't make a lot of crap.  But this one SEEMS to make some sense despite the horrid acting.  Joelle Coeur, who is frequently nude here, is worth the price of admission.  If you get anything out of this film, then it will be interpreting the symbolism of Jean Rollin, which is not easy.  There are no road maps to his films, but ""chacun a son gout,"" as the French would say.  My copy of this film is the British release on Region 2 (Salvation Group Ltd.) which plays just fine on my region-free DVD player in French with English subtitles.  The new DVD and Blu-Ray editions due out on May 29, 2012 boast of being extended versions, but only add another 5 minutes to the 95 minute running time of previous releases.  I will say I prefer Jean Rollin to Jess Franco (in general) as these two directors are similar.  Miss Coeur is the star here, as Tina the pirate groupie, who has a taste for blood and violence mixed up with rape.  Before you cower in fear, this is more art-house fare than horror, and the violence is obviously staged.  As with most Rollin films, the blood appears to be quite phony, so hardcore horror fans will be disappointed.  However, it's my belief that the current interest in vampire films is what is driving the film company to release this new version now.  If you would like more reviews, take a look at the Internet Movie Data Base (IMDB) where it is reviewed under the title ""Curse of the Living Dead"" (1973).  I rate it 4 stars out of 5.  Without Joelle Coeur, I wouldn't bother rating it at all, but I would join her pirate band to have a go with her, LOL.",1337126400,,1648,4.308441558441558
3643829,4,B001HSAPX6,"I have been discovering the movies of Jean Rollin this year and enjoying his weird mix of horror, magnificent locations and sexuality.  As I observed in my review of The Shiver of the Vampires, Rollin has the ability to make the viewer feel empathy for his supernatural creatures, even when they are engaged in behavior typical for their sort.  In Demoniacs, we meet a monster who does not inspire such feelings.  Tina, played by Joelle Coeur, is a terrifying woman in a gang of seamen who lure ships into crashing onto rocks so they can loot the ships.  On one such mission, they encounter two girls who have survived the wreck.  The sailors rape the girls while Tina delights in the scene.  However, the gang's leader, The Captain, starts to have a conscience attack in the form of visions of the girls he thinks they killed.  It turns out they are still alive and the gang decides to hunt them down and finish the job.  The girls make their way to a run-down abbey where the Devil himself is imprisoned, needing two innocents like them to free him.  He promises them the means of vengeance on their attackers.  I am not in the habit of revealing how a work ends; I will say that the essential goodness of the girls strongly influences the actions they take. If I described the ending, it would sound downbeat if not horrific, but watching it, I thought it tragically noble. This is not a film for the sensitive or easily offended but it does have a power. Tina proves more frightening than the Devil; she is an unnerving mix of wild sensuality and dangerous violence.  It is ironic that in the Rollin films I have seen so far, it is a human who proves to be perhaps his most monstrous creation.",1332892800,3,1697,4.495114006514658

8309442,2,B001HSAPX6,"Whenever I watch a Rollin film, I ask myself, ""Was this a deeply meaningful work of cinema replete with symbolism exploring the human condition, or was this a pretentious, stream-of-consciousness vehicle for exploitative, gratuitous nudity and violence?""  This film falls into the latter category.  SPOILER ALERT. Sort of. The film opens with an introduction of the main characters.  Why, I don't know.  We then are treated to an extended scene in which two young shipwreck survivors are sexually assaulted on the beach.  In the middle third of the film Rollin introduces a variety of characters, plot elements, and (admittedly) interesting cinematography, none of which have any bearing whatsoever upon the outcome of the film.  At this point it is as if Rollin threw up his hands and said, ""What the hell, let's go back to the beach and rape the girls some more.""  Thus the film ends exactly where it began.  Other reviewers call this film ""surreal.""  My take is that Rollin had a story in mind but simply gave up on the plot halfway through.  So if you are a Rollin fan, it may be worth a viewing, otherwise give it a pass.",1476316800,2,1126,4.757731958762887
