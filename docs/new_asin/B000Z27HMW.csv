3037408,3,B000Z27HMW,"It is a truth universally acknowledged that Jane Austen fans have yet to find an adaptation of ""Mansfield Park"" that truly does justice to the novel.  ""Pride & Prejudice"" and ""Persuasion"" have their share of successes, with the 1995 versions and the recent versions having (for the most part) become instant classics and fan favorites.  But not so for poor ""Mansfield Park.""

I wanted so badly to love this version, especially with all the press hoopla surrounding the casting of Billie Piper (Dr. Who). The 1980s version starring Sylvestra Le Touzel remains the most faithful adaptation of the book, but has become outdated, is slow moving and tends to drag in places. The 1990s version starring Frances O'Connor is an anathema to Austen purists. This is Mansfield Park in name only, and is a slap on the face for true fans of the book. In short, Janeites were ready for a new and improved adaptation of ""Mansfield Park.""

Sadly though, this new version falls short of expectations. If you have not read the book, then you will probably like it. If you have - and especially if you count yourself as an Austen purist - then there are many aspects of this version that you may find irritating (or worse..).

I dislike starting my reviews on a negative note, but I was disappointed with this one. Among the shortcomings are as follows (warning - SPOILERS):

- Casting of Billie Piper and Maggie O'Neill. Personally, I find Billie's blonde hair and dark eyebrows very distracting and far too modern for a period piece. Ladies in the Regency era tied their hair back in a bun but the filmmakers totally disregarded this and left Billie to run around like a wild child instead of a proper Regency lady.  I also took issue to Maggie O'Neill who was not quite the right age and was a tad too ""fine looking"" as the widow Mrs. Norris.
- Very choppy beginning. It almost feels like the first half hour is filmed in hand-held camera.  It is annoying and gave me a headache.
- Too many scenes were altered or omitted entirely. Many characters do not even make an appearance.  There is no visit to the Price family home in Portsmouth; no visit to the Rushworth home; Maria and Julia Bertram disappear in the second act, when Maria and Rushworth marry; Maria and Julia Bertram and Mr. Yates are mere cyphers and don't have much to do; other than William Price, all the other Prices (including Susan) are absent in this story...and the list goes on.
- Scenes jump around and there is little coherence to the screenplay. Novices to the story will be confused (especially in the beginning) as new characters come and go, there is little character development and no fluidity as the scenes move from one to another.  Everything in the first act is rushed and you feel like the filmmakers are trying to cram hundreds of pages of storyline into the first half hour.

There is, however, a light at the end of the tunnel.  The story does improve as you go along and the last half hour provides some memorable highlights.  Blake Ritson's Edmund proves to be swoon-worthy in some key (romantic) scenes from the book.  The 'thunderbolt' scene (you will know what I mean when you see it) up until the end is certainly worth seeing.  Jemma Redgrave's Lady Bertram also does some scene stealing of her own.

Most of the cast are perfect for their roles.  Blake Ritson is quite dashing (in a solemn, Byronic way) and handsome as Edmund Bertram and Joe Beattie makes for a charming and attractive Henry Crawford.  Jemma Redgrave, Douglas Hodge (Sir Thomas Bertram), Hayley Atwell (Mary Crawford), Michelle Ryan (Maria Bertram) and others are well cast.  Hayley Atwell shines as the scheming, manipulative and lovely Mary Crawford. Jemma Redgrave's portrayal of Lady Bertram is a change from the book, but I actually liked it.  She gave an otherwise bland character added dimension and some warmth.  Douglas Hodge (a veteran of British period dramas) is excellent as always.

All in all, this version has a bumpy beginning but a much improved second act, overall good casting, mediocre screenplay and what appears to be a relatively low budget (all of the scenes were filmed in one location - yes, no kidding).  If you want a more faithful adaptation of Mansfield Park, look to the 1980s version starring Sylvestra Le Touzel and Nicholas Farrell (who, incidently, play Mrs. Allen and Mr. Musgrove in the new versions of ""Northanger Abbey"" and ""Persuasion"", respectively).

Of the 3 recent Austen tv adaptations, this is my least favorite. For my choices in the recent Masterpiece Theater dramas, my vote goes to ""Northanger Abbey"" with ""Persuasion"" a distant second.  I have yet to see the new version of ""Sense & Sensibility"" so I will reserve judgement until then.  This ""Mansfield Park"" is certainly worth a viewing, just make sure to keep your expectations in check.",1197936000,283,4840,4.773381294964029

Billie Piper does a great job as Fanny and brings to the role an innocence and charm that makes her instantly likeable and fun to watch.

3037464,1,B000Z27HMW,"I love Jane Austen. I love Billie Piper.  If I was going to pair the two, I would cast Miss Piper as the sarcastic, stubborn, quick-tempered Lizzie Bennet in Pride and Prejudice. What on earth possessed anyone to cast her as the meek, sickly poor relation Fanny Price I cannot begin to imagine. It's a perfect miscasting that is in no way improved by the efforts of the screenwriter to rebuild the story from scratch to shoehorn her into the role. The story might as well be a completely new one, it bears so little resemblance to anything Jane Austen wrote.

If you are at all familiar with the original novel, you will find yourself sadly disappointed in this train wreck of an adaptation. If you want to acquaint yourself with Austen via films, please don't attempt it with this one. It won't work at all.",1437004800,3,808,4.527397260273973

3037496,4,B000Z27HMW,"I choose four stars with a sense that it may be impossible to put a novel such as Mansfield Park on film. Many of the reviews here are pointing out the inadequacy of this film version of the novel, some a little too fussily it seems to me. Chiefly missing from this movie is Jane Austen as satirist, as with her brilliant treatment in the novel of Mrs. Norris, who scarcely emerges in this film at all. The section with Fannie gone home to Portsmouth, and the important contrasts in her home with Mansfield Park is also missing. A movie such as this is best looked at as ""based on."" In a sense it tells a slightly different story, especially for the diligent or scholarly viewer eager to test it against the original. Having said all that, this film is well acted, especially with its excellent ending, which may even surpass Jane's ending itself! It's also vivid in photography and very pleasing with its music. The actors playing Fannie and Edmund are very good, and brilliant in the finale. I congratulate all involved in this very pleasant movie version of Jane's story.",1423180800,,1074,4.598958333333333

It arrived today, and I am completely disappointed with this product. Several important scenes have been deleted. For instance, after meeting the Crawfords, the scene between Fanny and Edmund has been deleted. In that scene, Edmund tells Fanny he is borrowing her horse to teach Miss Crawford how to ride. Then the scene showing Fanny impatiently waiting for her horse to be returned has been deleted as well. I had hoped there would be new scenes in this that I had not seen at YouTube or on TV, instead there are less. What a waste of money and a complete disappointment. If it wasn't such a hassle, I'd return this and get my money back. Don't get this version. Look for one that has not been chopped up. This one will anger you if you have seen the entire program. It has certainly angered me. Shame on Masterpiece Theatre for releasing this mangled version of Mansfield Park.

3037511,1,B000Z27HMW,"^ **Quotes from Edmund, chapters 15 & 16.**

According to the description, ""Mansfield Park (is) one of Austen's most complex plots....""-- so much so that the writers apparently gave up in their efforts to retell this (now 200 year old) tale before they even started! (I can scarcely believe Rebecca Eaton *exec. producer* was involved with production!!)

I really hate to give anything associated with Jane Austen 1 star, being I'm an immense fan of her works, and many of the adaptations of them. But the adage to not judge a book by its movie certainly applies in this case! While I can't say it's Jane Austen's best book (it's personally my least favorite out of her 6 main novels), this adaptation does the book almost zero justice!

To the script writers, did they even read this book?! ""Fanny"" could easily pass for ""Lydia"" or ""Kitty (the 2 youngest ""Bennet"" sisters) with her fits of giggles, carefree spirit, bluntness, and lack of depth of emotion (where was Fanny's nerves & tears?!). ""Edmund"" is entirely too flirtatious with ""Fanny""; the viewer is left to wonder who he's more in love with (not so in the book)! There really isn't a standout performance in the whole lot (obviously because there was hardly any time to develop the characters, or the storyline).
The acting mostly goes from bad to worse (echoing Edmunds above estimation of the ""Lovers Vows"" play); which is a bit baffling because I've seen most of the actors in other roles, and thought them pretty good. Much of it is juvenile, and cringeworthy.
The beginning few minutes (the play rehearsal with Maria Bertram, and Mr. Crawford), and the last 8 minutes (with Fanny & Edmund)- I can imagine Jane reaching for her smelling salts at the sight!

The pace at which this production breezes through the 48 chapter book makes your head spin! Actually, being that 90% of the events are skipped, made up, mish-mashed, or extremely condensed-- I guess they can set their own pace.

I'm trying to think of some redeeming qualities of this production.. Other than some nice scenery, stately houses, and a few pretty costumes (minus the distracting low-cut bodices & heaving bosoms in almost every scene), there's not much depth here.

In conclusion, my advice would be to skip this Harlequin-esque imitation, and read the book!

**Side note**
The story of ""Mansfield Park"" has only been given 2 previous adaptation attempts. The BBC miniseries in the 80's, which I've only seen a few minutes of. Although rather lengthy (about 6 hrs.), and ""stagey"" like most BBC productions of that era, I have plans to definitely check it out. From what I hear though, it's a painstakingly accurate adaptation.

As for the '99 movie, that too isn't faithfully accurate (I'd say it's about 75%.. although missing a major character- William *Fanny's older brother*).
I decided to view it a 3'd time after reading the book. I finally understand what they did! In the beginning it says that it's also based on Jane's personal writings. What they don't tell you, is that they've essentially merged Jane Austen herself, with Fanny Price. While I can't say that I hate what they did (as far as entertainment value goes), it does give the viewer a different idea of how Miss Austen wrote her in the book. I guess because the book character is so introverted/introspective, and not as lively, or witty as JA's other heroines, the creators felt the need to do this? (And no, Fanny was not ever an aspiring writer, that was all Jane Austen there.)
The last quarter- excepting the final few minutes- are the most changed from the book, so for a better understanding you may want to read chapters 39-48.",1416096000,,3643,4.8083067092651754

3037532,3,B000Z27HMW,"My problem with this movie was that I was expecting to see a movie version of Jane Austin's novel ""Mansfield Park"". While most of the plot points are there the main characters are off, especially Billy Piper as Fanny, way, way off. They are also missing some crucial scenes perhaps because the entire movie takes place at Mansfield Park.

If you just want to see a fun period style romance with lovely surroundings this is a good choice. It really is like a current historical romance novel made into a really great movie. If I had seen it with that expectation I think I would have thoroughly enjoyed it.

If you want to see an adaptation of Mansfield Park don't buy it, rent it ....come on even knowing it's a horrible version you're going  to have to see it for yourself. I'll warn you now Fanny Brice's character is a hoyden, with flying hair, low cut dresses, running from room to room like a child; she even invites Edmund into her bedroom when she is washing her hair and in her nightgown.

So watch it and enjoy it as what it is, a modern day historical romance. If it had hadn't claimed to be ""Mansfield Park"" I would have given it 4 stars but since it did I gave it 3.",1395014400,,1178,4.316742081447964

Why didn't they at the very least make the movie a bit longer to help with character development?!  I had never read the novel or seen any other movie rendition, so I decided to do some research.  I watched the 1999 version with Johnny Lee Miller (also from the 2009 ""Emma""), and I was disappointed. I was, also, totally confused; the two versions were so different, and I had no clue what Fanny Brice was supposed to be like.  Then I read the novel.  Ahhhh!  It was actually a great story, and the characters suddenly made sense.  Reading the book left me even more disappointed with this movie.  I stumbled across the 1983 miniseries version with Sylvestra Le Touzel.  While the production quality wasn't spectacular, the telling of the story was. I recommend the 1983 mini series or the novel.

My problem with this version is that it stays at Mansfield Park forever!  For me, some of the most emotionally intense moments were at Portsmouth and at Mr. Rushworth's estate, and those portions just never happen in the movie.

Often what the play writes do to trim down the originals is to create a crib note version, what they did in the Billie Piper version is create a crib note version of a crib note version, thus deleting every single nuance to this wonderful novel.
I like Billie Piper, and I find her to be a very pretty young actress, but what they tried to do here is to fit a 21st century beauty into an 18th century story...and they failed.

3037564,3,B000Z27HMW,"I recently was able to watch this adaption for the first time. I looked forward to it due to my love of Hayley Atwell and Billie Piper. They played their roles with perfection and subtlety. The same is easily said concerning the rest of the actors. I especially enjoyed the choice for Edmund. I now have a new character to imagine and adore from his phenomenal acting. Even with the amazing choices concerning cast, it still could not make this movie fantastic. It started with the camera shaking while the characters walked. I found the to be especially annoying. There were also the poor choices of editing in the script. They deleted characters, altered events, Maria and Julia disappear, and it didn't even let the picture leave Mansfield. The lack of budget shows, especially from that. There were also a few other nitpicks that I was annoyed by, but not overly disgruntled by (such as Billie not bothering to have her eyebrows match her hair.) The actors do good, but can only take the movie so far. Overall, I give it 3.5 stars. Five for the acting, one for the script.",1380758400,,1076,4.638743455497382

It was really well acted and if you have read the book, you just brought it into a better understanding. Reading the book and using your imagination to envision the scenes is the best movie but in the busy times of our life we need to relax and not try to mind meld with a chiller/thriller adventure.

On the cusp of womanhood, she finds herself loosing the one man she secretly loves only to be sought after another whom she does not trust.  There is a bit more to it than that but this is my quick sum of the movie plot.

From the beginning, the script felt rushed.  While I understand not every movie can afford to be three hours long, I do feel there were too many pivotal character scenes completely cut for the sake of time.  As a result, you can see the potential but also see how much it fell short of all it could have offered.

Still in terms of acting, I felt the actors did well with what they had to work with and they did not seem overly cheesy or robotic. Also, some of the scenes display some rather stunning views of the land.  In the end, however, not even the actors could hide the short falls of the script.

I would recommend watching it at least once if you are looking for a period movie, but if you are trying to decide on which version of the Mansfield Park movies to own - this would be my second choice - my first being the 1999 version (I have yet to watch the 1983 TV series version).",1362614400,2,1274,4.064

Also I did not read Edmund as being this spineless and ... insipid. I watch him in this and want to yell, ""Stop being such a wimp!"" I like him much better in the previous version (though not a version I like either).

If you have actually read Mansfield Park, its long and a little dull, and Fanny is not the most likeable character. The 80s adaptation might have been more accurate, but its also boring, Fanny is irritatingly mousey and nervous, and the sets, sound and light are painfully low budget.
This is a beautifully filmed production and has a wonderful cast. It is my favorite film from the recent Masterpiece adaptions of the JA books. But I watched it on Youtube recently and saw that the version posted there had scenes that are missing from our US version. Those scenes do add more to the story and I am curious why the US version cut them. There were many scenes that showed Aunt Norris' meanness towards Fanny, showed Fanny asking her uncle about slavery, showed more of Edmund's distress about/with Miss Crawford, and just further fleshed out the characters. I wish the filmmakers had included Fanny's trip to her family home in Portsmouth, but to fit the film into a more marketable length, I suppose they had to revise the plot somewhat and leave out some characters. I love the ending, I love Lady Bertram (she is less of a dope head here) and I loved Billie and Blake together. They expressed the  growing admiration and love so beautifully.

3037615,1,B000Z27HMW,"This is inexcusable!  First of all, they carefully cast all the characters extremely well, except Fanny, the central character- just ridiculous!  Fanny has to exude quiet intelligence which has not been given its due because of the combination of a shy nature and the way she has been treated or there is no point to the story.  Secondly, they have telescoped the story into an hour and a half by eliminating most of Jane Austen's best dialogue which is exactly what makes the story so worthwhile. This is not a tale that can be told though a series of occurrences which the screenwriter attempted.  It is painful to watch.  If only they had cast Fanny properly, the production would have been tolerable!

A word about the aunts- they are pretty much one-dimensional archtypes in the book.  The movie humanizes indolent Aunt Bertram especially in the end which is probably a good thing although it is done inconsistently and clumsily- the idea would have been to keep the idea of the detached, spoiled, unproductive  upper class without being totally dehumanizing.  On the other hand, the removal of the mean spirited, better-than-thou edginess of Aunt Norris with an attractive, bland character was, well, a stupid way of undermining the whole theme of the book- yes, the book may have indeed been a bit too repetitive without added dimension, but her role is pivotal and needed to be kept in some form.",1339286400,8,1404,4.841004184100418

3037617,2,B000Z27HMW,A poor production of an excellent novel of Jane Austen's. No comparison to the other movies I've seen such as Sense and Sensibility.,1336089600,3,132,4.782608695652174
3037618,4,B000Z27HMW,"Jane Austen fans have certainly been spoiled of late, for between 2007-2009, the BBC and ITV commissioned brand new versions of ""Sense and Sensibility"", ""Northanger Abbey"", ""Persuasion"", ""Emma"", and this MANSFIELD PARK.  The BBC's previous miniseries version in 1983 I would single out as being one of the most faithfully-drawn and utterly delightful; whilst a 1999 big-screen version retained precious little of the original Austen story except for the title.  This 2007 version I'd place somewhere in the middle.

Viewing all of these new Austen adaptations recently, it's come to my notice that all of them have tried to appeal to new viewers by casting the stories with popular younger talents.  In MANSFIELD PARK, former pop singer and ""Dr Who"" heroine Billie Piper stars as Fanny Price, the put-upon young orphan who goes to live with rich relations, the Bertrams of Mansfield Park.

At Mansfield Park, Fanny is regarded as the poor relation and is expected to comply with their every wish.  Only Edmund Bertram (Blake Ritson - 2009's ""Emma"" and ""Upstairs Downstairs"") treats her with the regard he shows his other siblings.  When Sir Thomas Bertram (Douglas Hodge) is called away to Antigua on urgent business, the Bertrams fall prey to the manipulations of their new neighbours, Mary Crawford (Hayley Atwell - ""The Sally Lockhart Mysteries"") and her brother Henry (Joseph Beattie).  Whilst Henry's quest to lure away the soon-to-be-married Maria (Michelle Ryan) is underway, Mary finds Edmund more challenging.  Upon Sir Thomas' return, Fanny is shocked to learn that the Bertrams wish her to marry Henry - despite what she has observed of his blatant seduction of Maria.  Once again, only Edmund is there to offer a comforting shoulder, but the events about to unfold will cause the Bertrams to view Fanny in an entirely new light...

There are two big stumbling blocks with this version of MANSFIELD PARK.  One is the length: there's a reason why the last BBC miniseries approached 6 hours in total.  One cannot enjoy the subtleties in Austen's original tale when everything is alarmingly sped up (and many important plot points chopped out) in order to tell the story in 93 minutes.  The other objection may be Billie Piper's casting as Fanny.  She isn't the Fanny from the novel at all, running around the gardens, talking back to Aunt Norris; not to mention that her blonde hair teamed with black eyebrows hardly fits the period.

Fanny is supposed to be meek, compliant and so devoted to her family at Mansfield Park that, at one point, she seriously considers going through with the marriage to Henry because she cannot bear to make them unhappy or worse, make them think she is ungrateful.  Although I eventually warmed to Ms Piper in the role, I believe she would have been better-cast as Mary Crawford.  Sylvestra Le Touzel in the 1983 BBC miniseries shall always be my ideal screen Fanny Price.

Blake Ritson is a fabulous Edmund and Hayley Atwell brings us a most beguiling, kittenish Mary Crawford.  The Bertrams are handled with great sensitivity, and I loved Douglas Hodge as Sir Thomas.  Jemma Redgrave, I'm happy to report, finally gave me a Lady Bertram that I could completely warm to, as opposed to the detached creature portrayed in previous versions.  Maggie O'Neill (TV's ""Shameless"") is delicious as the icy Aunt Norris.

Amongst other credits, screenwriter Maggie Wadey has previously written ""The Buccaneers"" in addition to the *admittedly problematic* 1986 BBC version of ""Northanger Abbey"", so she already has cache amongst the period drama set.  It's just a shame that she wasn't commissioned to write a longer miniseries version, as MANSFIELD PARK simply doesn't work as well in a conventional movie-length treatment.  Despite the shortcomings it remains enjoyable, though I suspect it will be more so for the casual viewers who don't know what is missing.",1333929600,2,3894,5.056338028169014
3037619,2,B000Z27HMW,"Did we really need another Mansfield Park remake?
Patricia Rozema's 1999 adaptation was a flat out dud, but at least there was some heart put into the project. And it does earn some points for casting.

The script for this version was nothing short of bland and uninspired.  It seemed to me as if the writer was given twenty four hours to capsulize the story and create a script because that's about all the heart that was poured into it.  It's like watching a really bad movie (any bad movie) and knowing the actors involved only did it for the paycheck.  But that isn't the only flaw here.

The casting! Most of the choices were fine; but Billie Piper?? Oi vey! Was the casting director smoking crack the day she read for the part?  She is the antithesis of Fanny: bleachy blonde hair complete with dark roots, jet black eyebrows and buck-toothed grill (I apologize for the harshness of my description, but it's pretty accurate).  Someone remarked she was far too modern looking and that's the absolute truth. The hair and make-up could have been dealt with (and it's a shame they weren't) but this actress needed better direction.  She acted all over the place; it was, at it's best, mentally agonizing to watch.

Not all were dreadful ... otherwise this would have gotten a single star.  But my recommendation is to skip the movies altogether -- read the book. Let your imagination do the work because clearly no one has been able to come up with a screen version that's worthy of Austen.",1323907200,7,1492,4.617424242424242

She seemed more suited for a different film - she was the only one to always wear her hear down and loose, lots of bosoms and parted lips. This version of the film only lightly treats the friendship between Mary Crawford and Fanny, as well as the relationship between Henry and Fanny. The older cousins all but disappear when the first marriage happens -- and it leaves out Fannie's visit to her family (instead she's ""left behind"" as punishment).

Now after watching it a third time, having watched the other two versions, it is my FAVORITE version.  Why?  Because in this one, the sweetness of Fanny's personality and the feeling between Fanny and Edmund are well conveyed.  These are two of the main points of the story, and are the elements that draw the viewer in and make us care.  Also, there is liveliness and energy in the movie -- this Fanny has health and spirit, which also adds to the enjoyment.

This is the second Mansfield Park I've bought (I have the version starring Frances O'Connor) and this one, while it definitely kept to the book more, did not seem to actively grasp the characters. In fact there seemed to be very little personality to anybody, except Mary Crawford, who was much more lascivious than merely misled and progressive in mindset. Henry Crawford was duly wicked, but no more than a blandly personified rake. Sir Thomas seemed always to speak as though in a rage, and in such a low, hissing tone I just stopped trying to hear his lines. Mrs. Norris was mostly disapproving, and mostly silent. Edmund was played well, as was (surprisingly) Lady Bertram, and William was well done as well. But worst of all was Fanny, who seemed to have no personality at all and at most displayed a repressed disappointment when Edmund professed his love for Miss Crawford. There are multiple scenes where she is running about playing tag or hide and seek, or chasing a dog - multiple enough to cause some eyebrow raising and thoughts of, ""Really?"" I suppose this is to further impress her carefree and cheerful spirit, but this is again not in keeping with the novel's Fanny Price.

Not unenjoyable, but a little unbelievable.",1310169600,,1267,4.8119266055045875
3037647,1,B000Z27HMW,"I understand that this movie was supposed to be an ""adaptation"" of Mansfield Park, but it would perhaps be more accurate to say that the names were borrowed from Austen's novel and transplanted into some rough crossover between Gossip Girl and Cruel Intentions. This so-called adaptation felt more like a fan-fiction written by someone with only a vague understanding of what Mansfield Park is really about.

To begin with, the Fanny Austen imagined was ""extremely timid and shy, shrinking from notice,"" yet here she is seen as a strong-willed girl who quite openly and coyly flirts with her cousin throughout the entire film, possesses contempt for most members of her neglectful family. There's even one seen where her cousin Edward walks into her room while she is washing her hair and quite undressed (for the time) and the two shyly smile at one another.

Lady Bertram seems to fill Mrs. Norris' role along with Mrs. Norris herself, making the derision of Fanny Price a bit over the top. Her uncle throughout the movie remains quite cold toward her, despite Austen suggesting he regarded her warmly, especially in light of the antics of his own children.

The film also begins roughly halfway through Austen's novel, with Maria already engaged to Mr. Rushmore. I understand the need to save time, and perhaps beginning there allowed the writers to more easily alter everything about the character of Fanny Price without more explanation.

Jane Austen should be rolling over in her grave.",1308268800,12,1492,5.004032258064516

3037649,3,B000Z27HMW,"Gah, what can I say about this adaptation. The good? Well...it was better than the Patricia Rozema version! And...a couple of the actors were well-cast. And...that's about it. Yup, it was a dud. Patricia Rozema made a terrible movie, but you could tell she cared about the movie she made. This one...it was as if their hearts weren't in it. The script was dull and the budget was almost nonexistent. Everything took place in the same couple of rooms or on the lawn at Mansfield Park. That means no Portsmouth and no Prices, other than Fanny and William, and no trip to Sotherton. And the casting and characterizations...most were decent (with a couple bizarre exceptions) but nothing amazing.

The bizarre casting choice for me was definitely Billie Piper. This is a horrible thing for me to say, but I thought she looked more like a prostitute than Fanny Price, with the cleavage, the bleach blond hair (but still black eyebrows!), and the buck tooth veneers. The screenwriter really didn't seem to know what to do with her character either. She had moments where she was quiet and shy and observant and others where she was running around laughing like Patricia Rozema's Fanny. They wanted to stay truer to the book character, I guess, but were still afraid to keep Fanny really as she was. Really, the only compliment I can give is that she and the actress who played young Fanny really looked alike.

I guess if you're really turned off by the old-school production values in the 1983 version or you can't find a copy, it would be better to watch this version than the 1999 one. That version was so horrible though that anything looks better in comparison.

Well, I wasn't exactly pleased with it since it seems to breeze through the story a little too quickly. On the other hand, the viewer does get the general feeling for what is going on. This is definitely not the most accurate version.

What I don't particularly like is that you don't get inside each of the principal characters as you do with the novel. In the film you see a little bit inside fanny and a little bit inside edmund and mary but thats about it.

I will say that this version is very watchable although I enjoyed the 1999 version a lot more (even though it is more fanciful and modern for its time). Having read the novel Mansfield Park several times i can safely say that the most accurate adaptation is the 1983 version, but it is also the most boring and most difficult version to watch (and none among the cast is particularly attractive).

The older generation of the film was cast too young as 30-40 year olds were playing 40-50 year olds making it hard to tell apart the generations at times.

Mind you, this is from someone who rarely reads narrative fiction except for murder mysteries and who thinks sitting down with a popular book on physics or a biography of Richard II is a pleasant way to spend an afternoon.

I've seen at least two---and part of a third---and of those I've viewed from credits to credits this one, starting Billie Piper as Fannie, is quite good; I think that it certainly conveys the author's intentions.  The complexity of the novel, with its wheels within wheels, has been much pared down to suit a two hour production, but the central issue of the rot of overindulgence, vanity, and deceit and its effects on society is quite clear.  Less clear is the issue of slavery, the foundation of the Bertram family's wealth, which is only alluded to in passing when Mr. Bertram is forced to go to the West Indies to deal with urgent ""problems"" there that effect their financial situation. (England was beginning to question the morality of slavery, which it abolished in the 1830s, and Austen was composing the novel during the opening years of the century).

The Bertram family has done all the ""correct"" things dictated by society and on this yardstick has measured itself  ""successful.""  Smug in its sense of its own worth, the family invites a young relative, eight year old Fanny the daughter of the ""unfortunate"" sister of Mrs. Bertram, to live with them and enjoy the benefits of her connection.  Essentially they need an appreciative audience whose duty is to be ""grateful"" and humbled by the Bertram family's status.  (In other versions, the sycophantic Aunt Norris shows us how it's done).  Her presence in the family is to be a constant reminder of how perfect their lives are compared to those of others.  Instead the little girl misses her own family and is intimidated rather than awed by the excesses she sees around her.  The limits that Mr. Bertram places on his generosity to his niece because she is not quite ""acceptable"" actually allow Fanny to grow up normal in the midst of the dysfunction of his own family.  When the fruits of his arrogant sense of identity become apparent by the ruination of his eldest daughter's reputation and the near death of his eldest son and heir through drink, Bertram finally admits that it is only the sensible Fanny upon whom he can depend.

The stifling boredom arising from a life lived in affluence but without purpose is made abundantly clear by Mrs. Bertram and her children.  The lady shows utter devotion to her pug dogs whose litters she is apparently allowed to raise herself, and she has a propensity for falling asleep anytime there is a family gathering.  She lies languidly on her couch, doing little or nothing, day in and day out, while her children are raised by and her home managed by others.  Her eldest son is so overwhelmed by boredom and purposelessness that he gambles and drinks himself nearly to death, while her youngest finds it difficult to make decisions without first consulting Fanny and even begins to question his choice of professions because his infatuation over his neighbor has brought this choice into conflict with her ambitions.  Mrs. Bertram's eldest daughter is so used to getting her way in everything, that she sees no reason why she shouldn't have a rich husband and an exciting and handsome lover.  And her youngest daughter simply disappears into London ""society.""  This is the ""perfect life"" only if you are Voltaire's Dr. Pangloss,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Candide/dp/1450576931/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Candide</a>.

The WGBH Boston production of Mansfield Park is played straight; that is to say, it's entirely serious and straight forward.  Little by way of levity occurs.  This is the ""Henrick Ibsen"" version of the story, so to speak.  There is another, more George Bernard Shaw, version where some of the characters, particularly Aunt Norris and Aunt Bertram, are played as more comedic and where the family's complete dependence on Fanny borders on obsession.  Although I enjoyed it very much when I saw it on TV, I'm not certain it really conveyed the author's intentions nearly as well as this one does.

Costumes---a strong presence in many of the WGHB Boston/BBC productions---are not quite as stunning in this instance, though they're probably more realistic for the times.  One of the wedding gowns is quite lovely--though I hated the hat--but otherwise the costumes designed for this version are less impressive.  The scenery too is somewhat lacking, which is amazing given that even a series like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midsomer-Murders-Set-16/dp/B002MUAXJ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midsomer Murders: Set 16</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Agatha-Christie-s-Poirot-The-Definitive-Collection/dp/B001AOC9G8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Agatha Christie's Poirot: The Definitive Collection</a>&nbsp;is able to convey an intensity of natural verdure that is positively breath taking.  Admitting that some of the dialogue indicates the appreciation of the natural vistas of Mansfield Park--as opposed to the often overdone formal gardens of such estates--one might still expect more of a sense of from whence this appreciation arises. Even fields in England can be glorious works of ""art,"" but those viewed from Mansfield Park are just boring--like the people perhaps?

There, her only friend is her cousin Edmond, whom she grows to love.  When she is 18, new neighbors Henry and Mary Crawford come into her life; Henry has eyes for Fanny while Edmond is smitten with Mary.

This Masterpiece Theatre version of Jane Austen's novel was really disappointing.  The biggest problem was the casting of Billie Piper as Fanny.  Her always-disheveled, bottle blonde hair and inexplicably black eyebrows weren't true to the period and she acted too modern and low class; none of her dialogue was believable because she looked so wrong for the part.  She would have been better as a naughty chambermaid than someone brought up in an aristocrat's home.  Another victim of inaccurate hair and make-up was Hayley Atwell (Mary Crawford) who had a 2007 hair style and sculpted eyebrows which were lovely, but completely wrong for the time.  Her casual speech and flirtatious actions would have had no place in formal Regency society.

The actors playing Fanny's aunt and uncle were too young and lacked a lord and lady's proper breeding.  And the waltz danced in the final scene would certainly have shocked onlookers, if indeed it were even known at that time, but there was only pleasant reaction to the dance.

3037687,1,B000Z27HMW,"I love M.P. I think it's my second favorite of Austen's works, though Emma is close. If you assigned M.P. to a freshman English class and asked them to write a 3-5 page paper on the plot, this is the movie you would get based on their summaries. It's choppy. Scene shifts are sudden. There is no subtlety, whether in acting, stagecraft, or filming. They give you one blunt, bludgeoned sentence to give you the fullest character of each person and fail miserably to develop anyone any further. With such a view of it, you can imagine the snarky comments I might add when I discovered that Jane Austen was not even credited in the film for having written the novel - Maggie Wadey gets that honor.

Most of the main scenes are there, but in such a choppy fashion that it's a wonder anyone who hadn't read it could follow it. Fanny gives you a brief introductory narration, and from then until halfway through the movie she does not speak - she just looks a little severely at everyone. She spends most of her time pouting. Edmund, when he realizes who he loves, is feverish and frightening and does a terrible job emoting love and affection. He spends most of his time looking like he needs to run off to the lavatory, but has to look dignified until the director yells Cut. They almost completely removed Aunt Norris and one of the sisters from the movie (and how do you understand what Fanny has gone through without Aunt Norris??).

They also almost completely cut Mr. Crawford's romancing of Fanny. He says he intends to pursue and she says he lacks constancy. He then meets her in the garden and says he has proved his constancy! Did I blink and miss it?? The next scene is when they learn a plot spoiler. She doesn't even go home to her own family! Mary Crawford was done halfway decently but, lacking Ms. Austen's subtlety, her lifting of her skirt to show her ankle, her blatant come-hither glares, and her demanding air make her much more of a tyrannical temptress than a decided clergyman-to-be would consider. The one humorous note is that the oldest brother, Tom, is played by a Mr. (James) D'Arcy.

I could go on, but won't. We'll just settle back and be thankful for Keira Knightly's ability to do justice to a long story in a short amount of time (screenplay by Deborah Moggach), sip the rapturous tea of Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth, and delight at Gwennyth Paltrow's follies.

3037701,4,B000Z27HMW,"I have to admit that it's cinematography wasn't as well done as the previous Mansfield Park productions, but it had a wholesome cute nature to it that made it superior in my mind to the 1999 Frances O'Conner version.
For die hard Austen fans, it definitely does not follow the novel, but at least there isn't sexual pictures, lesbian insinuations, or illicit material in it as was evidenced in the 1999 production.
  In this version, the director must have been interested in portraying a greater dichotomy between Fanny's class and her upper class cousins than in keeping with period fashion.
  For instance, Fanny looks like a wild, modern young woman in this version with her relatively-short-hair always down instead of kept up like the ladies of the time. If they were going to leave her hair down to prove a point of her difference and disregard for the proper style of the day, then they should have at least had her hair be the proper length that it would have been in those days. Thomas Bertram had hair practically the same length that Fanny had, and he is a man.
  Also, in this version, there is a considerable amount left out concerning the Price family and the activities within the Bertram household, as well as many of the character details of the Crawfords... which the 1999 version is better at including.
  There also is an awkward mention of the slavery that Sir Bertram is involved in that seems more thrown in as a ditch effort to one-line the abolitionist thought of the time. Yet, I still prefer it to the vulgar drawings of explicit nature in the 1999 version.

All in all, this one is better suited for family audiences than the 1999 version, but is less adherent to the novel than any of its predecessor films.",1252022400,6,1737,4.631921824104235

3037706,1,B000Z27HMW,"In any film adaptation of a novel liberties must be taken, but in this case critical points in the story were removed as misleading touches were added.  First and foremost, we have to see the profound but infinitely gradual transformation of Fanny Price.  This is the Cinderella story as it might be in reality.  Fanny is described as remarkably pretty, but it does not show until she is forced into the spotlight.  Her strength of character has been formed by years of abuse and neglect bolstered by probably an excellent education as she was left without other amusements.
In this film, the Fanny has far too much confidence and a kind of wildness that is wholly at odds with her description. The novel makes it clear that she has an innate elegance that is nowhere to be seen in this film.

The characters in Mansfield Park may be Austen's most realistic.  There is more than a hint that Sir Thomas is involved in the slave trade.  The sisters, Maria and Julia seem like clones, but you can read the subtle but telling differences; illustrating these would make the film so much more interesting.  Mrs. Norris is a true villain who tortures Fanny for years.  Henry Crawford can be seen as a tragic figure who is nearly saved by his association with Fanny; the scenes in Portsmouth open us to his potential.  Edmund is kind of stiff, and marriage to Mary might have helped him.  The novel makes clear that Tom does not return to the racing pages after his brush with death. Even the character of Susan offers a glimpse into what a strong character in reduced circumstances can achieve.

When I came across this one, I read all the reviews (most of which were poor) and quickly went the other way. I first watched the 1999 version, it having better reviews, and I liked it quite a bit (aside from thinking ""Where is William?""). But, still curious, I came back to this version, having always liked the adaptions this group put out, and was astounded that it could recieve such bad reviews. I loved it. Some things are missing, if you are considering the book to be the supposed script. But, I thought it flowed very well even with those pieces missing. If you enjoy the book, you will most likely enjoy this movie. It is not word for word in line with the book, but there are many key quotes that make their way onto this film adaption of Mansfield Park. I recommend it.",1227830400,3,908,4.378698224852071

She dyed her hair blonde for the movie but unfortunately she has a deep undergrowth coming through. Umm, not sure if she knew that girls didn't really dye their hair in that era and that I am sure she would've been able to afford it even if they did. Without watching her hair roots everytime she was on camera, she and the rest of the cast gave off such a poor performance that you didn't care what happened.

3037720,3,B000Z27HMW,"While this movie did not bother me too much and was quite enjoyable in some places, I will never understand why modern movie-makers feel like they have to make politically correct comments in movies from this time period. I do not recall when Wilberforce started his anti-slavery movement in England, but if Austen didn't make a reference to it in her book, is it likely that Fanny would have questioned Sir Thomas's slave-owning tendencies? Both this movie and the '99 version did it, this one thankfully MUCH less. Yes, we all know NOW that slavery is wrong, evil, etc., but back then it was a way of life, and I seriously doubt that meek little Fanny Price would have said anything about it.",1219622400,3,694,4.650406504065041
3037721,1,B000Z27HMW,"I like Billie Piper's acting, I do.  Her turn in ""Shakespeare Retold: Much Ado About Nothing"" was excellent, and though I haven't seen all her episodes, I found Piper's Rose very good as well.  She more than held up her own against veterans like David Tennant and especially Christopher Eccleston.

""Mansfield Park"", though, was very bad.  Very...not good.

Fanny is supposed to be a mousy, sickly creature; it's why Edmund gives her a horse to ride for exercise every day.  When she misses a few days, she gets sick.  Why is Fanny running about and chasing people around the house?  I can't tell if this is poor script or poor acting or both.  This is not Fanny Price.

Most people have picked up on the major plot alteration as well, with Fanny not being forced to leave Mansfield Park despite her rejection of Crawford.  It's a major plot and character point - Fanny getting kicked around and basically living at the whim of the Bertrams.  Also, her rejection of Crawford is a major, major problem, and her being sent away is evidence of that.

To be honest, I can't remember much more; it was kind of painful to watch.  Not any better than the 1999 Frances O'Connor ""Mansfield Park"", though I personally wouldn't say it was worse.  (1999's Fanny the budding writer?!)  Austen sighs in her grave and hopes Andrew Davies will write the next ""Mansfield Park"" adaptation.

What was good?  Blake Ritson turned in a fairly good Edmund, and Hayley Atwell turned in a fantastic Mary Crawford, with all her complexity - her kindness towards Fanny, her protectiveness towards Fanny, and her moral laxness.  I'm biased towards Jemma Redgrave.  I was also amused that the Bionic Woman played Maria Bertram and that young Fanny (Julia Joyce) had played the younger version of Billie Piper's characters twice before.

It might look stagy, but I found the 1980s BBC ""Mansfield Park"" truer to the book than either of the new versions.  Nicholas Farrell and Sylvestra Le Touzel in their first cooperative outing were good.  A young Farrell gives his Edmund real life (especially given how productions looked then), and Le Touzel, while she does have the wide-eyed spaciness of some of the 80s adaptations, presents the most Austen-ish Fanny I've seen yet.",1218758400,10,2242,4.826771653543307

There was no substance to this story adn it did not feel like anything related to Jane Austin. It was some airy fairy version of something. Billy Piper was so wrong for this period character with her blonde layered 70's hairdo and thick dark brown eyebrows and she did not have the mannerisms of a lady of this time like Jennifer Ehle had in Pride and Predjudice. Billy Piper was so miscast and was the worst miscast and the rest of the actors too in my opinion. It was just plain boring to me. Miss Crowleys hair too was like something I wore at my first holy communion when I was 7 I think back in the 60's. It was nothing like the hairstyle from that era with her wispy pieces from her ears and the fancy pulled back bun which was way too modern. I found the female actors just did not have the mannersims of this time period and did not act them well at all as ladys of regency of 19th century england. Blake Ritson was the best cast in this. He just ""had it"" and was convincing of this period. Before I knew it, the movie was over and I thought what was this all about where is the story here. Too Short of a movie.......................If Toby stephens, Colin Firth, Ruth Wilson and Jennifer Ehle had been cast this would have been superb as long as they had the correct team players as well. The cover of the DVD was strange as I found Billy Pipers hair and dress somewhat of a different time too again she looked like someone I would see today with bleach blonde hair layered with a 2008 top.

1. Most of the characters in the movie don't resemble the characters in the book.  Did the director ever read Mansfield Park?
2.  The story line has been completely changed.  For instance, after refusing Mr. Crawford, Fannie doesn't go to visit her family.  This is a major part of the story.  Why on earth would they right this out of the plot?
3.  The acting seems lifeless.

This version was better than the 1999 one with Hannah Taylor-Gordon, which butchered the story and misrepresented many of the characters horribly. The only accurate portrayal of this story is the old BBC version with the cheesy staging and bad filming. This version is pretty true to the story, but a lot of detail is left out.

I have watched almost every TV and movie version of Jane Austen's fiction.  Before I saw this one, the strongest objections that I had were a few significant deviations from Austen's intentions and a few versions that were just plain boring.

When I saw this version of Mansfield Park, I was so distracted by Billie Piper's appearance that I could not suspend disbelief and enjoy the story.  Her hair color does not occur naturally, now or in any century.  The ensuing contrast with her dark eye brows was jarring every time she was on screen.  I didn't get used to it for the entire movie.

If they were trying to create Fanny Price, why did they go for the Madonna (""Like a Virgin"") look?

Different actress?  Different hair color?  Lighten the eye brows?  All seem like good alternatives.

It seems like we will have to wait a bit longer for a classic movie version of Mansfield Park.  Maybe someone could convince Simon Langton to give it a try!",1212278400,3,1092,4.561855670103093

3037732,1,B000Z27HMW,"I'm having trouble deciding which of the four new Austen adaptations is the worst, Mansfield Park or Persuasion.  After some consideration, I've decided this one wins the prize.  The basic story is that a humble, meek poor relation comes to live with a grand family, an act of charity they intend will ""improve"" her.  In the end, she improves them.  Fanny is the one with steadfast moral character and the strength around which the family gathers in time of crisis.  This version ended up as a kind of Harlequin romance in historic costume, with Fanny alternating between child-like romping and sexy, smoldering looks of burning passion.  When will movie makers get it that there is something going on in Austen's work besides a romance?

The only successful adaptation I've seen is the Sylvestra Le Touzel version  from twenty-odd years ago.  It is sadly dated now and looks like a stage play on film, so it could stand to be updated.  I'm sadly beginning to think this will never be done well.",1209340800,15,995,4.766081871345029

Let me just say that the actors were the worst and the movie was cheap. The fashion was not right and Fanny's mouth and hair killed me.
At first, I thought it was pretty good, but then it became almost a comedy. Fanny is forward and does not have as strong of a will and good morals as she does in the book. The three things that really bothered me were:

1- In the book and the older version of the movie the love between Mr. and Mrs. Bertram is so beautiful and very sweet, whereas in the new film they hardly communicate.

2- What happened to the sea, Betsy, Susan, Fanny's family, and the visits from Henry Crawford?

3- It lacked the build up and suspense of Fanny's fate with Henry. That was a big frustration.

I suppose I shouldn't pick it apart anymore. It was an okay film and, though I will probably only watch it a few times, I give my thanks to Masterpiece Theatre for making the Jane Austen movies!!",1207008000,2,954,4.168478260869565

She is sooooo humble and good that I had trouble believing that certain rakish characters in the book could ever fall in love with her.  That said, this new movie adaptation chops a large book into a mere 90 minutes.  Characters, locations, and key passages have been completely removed.  Mansfield Park wasn't merely condensed - it was crushed.  As some earlier reviewers have said, the best way to watch it is to forget the original book and pretend that it's a brand new story.",1206576000,3,659,4.7368421052631575
3037739,3,B000Z27HMW,"The 1986 BBC adaptation of Mansfield Park remains in my opinion the most faithful adaptation of Jane Austen's work. Starring Sylvestra Le Touzel as Fanny Price and Nicholas Farrell as Edmund Bertram, the two leads were a bit tepid in their performances, yet the script was quite faithful, perhaps too much so. Then we had the 1999 movie version of Mansfield Park starring Frances O'Connor as Fanny Price. Though she acted very well with the given script, the version was so far removed from Austen's work as to render it alien, and could only be appreciated if viewed as a story by itself, without drawing comparisons with Austen's work [for one, O'Connor's Fanny was way too spirited and audacious].

And now we come to the 2007 adaptation of Mansfield Park, starring Billie Piper [of ""Doctor Who""] as Fanny Price, who at the age of ten is sent by her impoverished mother to live with her wealthy sister, Lady Bertram [Jemma Redgrave] and her family comprising husband, Lord Bertram, daughters Mariah and Julia, and sons Tom [James D'arcy] and Edmund [Blake Ritson]. Young Fanny knows her place and grows up loving her cousin Edmund [yes, it was apparently acceptable back in Austen's time]. Enter the scheming Mary Crawford [Hayley Atwell] ,and her brother Henry [Joseph Beattie] who worm themselves into Mansfield Park and cause much havoc within the family - Henry flirting with Mariah, and Mary setting her cap at Edmund, much to Fanny's chagrin. What follows is Fanny's journey through heartache, awakening, and finally happiness.

The acting in this version was not all that commendable - Billie Piper's Fanny with her striking blond locks and contrasting dark eyebrows is a far cry from Austen's portrayal of the demure and sickly Fanny Price in the novel. The rest of the cast too are quite lukewarm in their performances. Blake Ritson's Edmund, though very good-looking was very shallow and unconvincing,especially in his ardor for Ms Crawford. It is only in the later part that he seems to portray some semblance of sincerity in his newly discovered love for Fanny. Hayley Atwell's Mary Crawford does carry a semblance of credibility in her role and even manages to upstage Fanny Price at times.

This version takes too many liberties with Austen's work - the characters here are not faithful to the ones portrayed in the book, even the minor characters like Lady Bertram who was sickly in the novel,seems enthused with enough energy to pass energetic comments in this version. Many important scenes are cut out as are characters, and there is not much character development at all. It all appears like a rush job with disastrous consequences for the storyline.

The sets and cinematography though are beautifully done and the scenes of the countryside are particularly enchanting. On the whole, I can't say I love this latest adaptation of Mansfield Park [which seems to be the only one of Austen's works to fare so poorly in its screen adaptations], yet it is watchable, and makes for light entertainment.",1206403200,4,3018,4.97029702970297

The first couple of minutes take you well into the book with almost dizzying speed. I have never been a big fan of Fanny and she ties Emma as one of my  least favorite Jane Austen characters as she is a sickly, righteous young lady whose sole distinction is her goodness.  After allowing some time to pass between the rereading and then re-watching I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the Mansfield Park, such as it is, which is to say, in many ways, it is not.  Lady Bertram, as portrayed by Jane Austen, can barely summon the strength to breathe, let alone share an insightful thought, but in this MS she is perceptive.  Mrs. Norris, her sister, is robbed of all her malevolent, insipid and ultimately destructive  nature and is quite passive. Her behavior in the book results in grave character flaws in  Maria and Julia.  Fanny as portrayed by Billie Piper is an enjoyable character,and, unlike the Fanny in the book one can understand why Mr. Crawford and Edmund fall in love with her.

If you want a good adaptation of Mansfield Park, go to the previous BBC version.  It's a bit slow, (but so is the book) but very faithful to the spirit of the novel. This film, whatever it is, is not Mansfield Park, nor is the actress in any way Fanny. Fanny was reserved, shy, and not strong. The girl in this movie had her breasts and hair continually flopping about and her face (under her two tone hair) bore a perpetually sulky smirk that seemed to be trying for sultriness.  Her wild behavior (and appearance) bears no resemblance to the character in the book. The rest of the film wasn't too bad, but with the central character so out of character, it was hard to enjoy anything else.

Whoever did this adaption appears to have been influenced by the ""Beverly Hillbillies"" version of Pride and Prejudice that had equally bizarre behavior on the part of the main characters.  Suffice to say, Fanny wouldn't be running around as the character in this film does.

3037749,2,B000Z27HMW,"I have to agree with the other reviewers that question what were they thinking not putting up Fanny's hair! I realize to some this might be a minor point but one the most important themes in Mansfield Park is Fanny transition from Girl to Woman. We don't get to see this transformation of Fanny on film; she never puts her hair up and becomes a young lady. It is the other character's realization that Fanny is no longer a child that causes the plot to twist. Why does Mr. Crawford fall in love with Fanny in this version? Why does Edmond have a change of heart? Fanny's hair is a visual symbol of her maturing. On a side note it would have made the scene where Edmund walks in while she is washing her hair at the end more powerful. As he is seeing her as only a husband would see his wife- hair down.

Jane Austen did not write screen plays and most viewers are savvy enough to realize that a 90 minute production can not include all the sub-plots; scene changes that we find in the book. All can be forgiven if the main characters stay true to the original in spirit. This script did not capture the spirit of Fanny from the book. She was not there to glue everything together, which made the scenes seem choppy, stuck together and fans left to wonder if they had never read the book would they have understood what happened.

To end on a high note:

I thought it was quite a refreshing take on the story. I do agree with one reviewer that Fanny probably would not have run around as wildly as she did, with hair unbound...and there was one sequence in which a gentleman addresses Fanny and she ignores him while she plays hide and seek with a child which i thought was very improper for that time period.

The main themes are very much central to this film version.  Adapting a complex book for a movie is not an easy task.  Scenes and interactions are bound to be lost in a literalistic manner.

The huge turning point for Fannie Price is when she is returned to her parents after refusing Henry Crawford so that she might be reminded of the comfortable life she has grown accustomed to at Mansfield Park.  And yet in this film, they never even leave MP! We never see Maria in any opulence that the Rushforth fortune would have brought to her -- that would have clearly shown what she forfeited for the rake, Crawford.  And Fanny's hair is always down and messy, not very realistic for a period piece.  Lady Bertram has been relegated to background as is the condescending, manipulative Mrs. Norris that everyone loves to hate!  The scene with Edmund and Miss Crawford when she tells him of her strategy for over-coming the tragedy and scandal of their siblings' affair, was lacking in dramatic tension.  As was the entire film.  The 1999 version, is so much more enjoyable!  (Although I now own this DVD, I doubt it will be watched again.

It had to of been hand held, it jumped all over, why on earth didn't they use a steadycam? It made the film look bad! When it was steady, the shots were done so awkwardly; the angles were wrong and close ups were used when it would have been better to have a wider angle.

I was therefore pretty disappointed when I watched ""Mansfield Park"" master piece theater the first time...Here a short list of the major aspects (there is unfortunately more) that made me dislike this version;

The actress cast as Fanny Price (Billie Piper) while is not bad expressing Fanny's demure personality, she seems physically all wrong.  Her hair, looks stringy, color is really brassy (VERY FAKE LOOKING) and as other readers have mentioned not historically correct!  Why is it always down?  And for the most part looks like it hasn't been brushed!  Also the dark eyebrows and hint of mascara were really distracting!  She shows a bit too much cleavage for Fanny which might be plausible ONLY for her ""special picnic""

The character of Henry Crawford is really unlikable, there is not one moment in the film where you wonder, is he misjudged? Is he really a changed man?  That is one of the most entertaining parts of the story, is just when you start to believe that Henry Crawford might be a changed man, you discovered that you are being fooled!  This was missing in the movie, maybe because they have not devoted to much time showing Crawford trying to win Fanny's affection..  The older version staring Frances O Connor developed the relationship between Fanny & Crawford thoroughly.

You don't get to see just how poor Fanny's parents are in comparison to the Bertram's (it is mentioned only), thus it is more difficult to establish why Fanny feels like such an outsider at Mansfield Park.

Mrs. Norris is not as comical as she is in the book nor the other older movie version of Mansfield Park...

There was one thing that I did enjoy in this Mansfield Park, which the version staring Frances O Connor was missing....The close relationship of Fanny's and her brother William, as this character is totally missing from the older movie version.

I give it 2 stars for the nice costumes, set decorations and beautiful location.",1202169600,7,2122,4.823204419889502
3037761,5,B000Z27HMW,"Though I dearly love Austen's  Mansfield Park and could agree that much of what she wrote is missing in this adaptation, I nevertheless can appreciate that what we are given is still a delightful costume drama. Strip Austen of layers, if you must, but her genius is so forgiving that a worthwhile (i.e., passionate) story still exists. Couple that with the dexterous acting of Blake Ritson, Billie Piper and cast, and you have an enjoyable movie that brings the past to life in vivid colour.  The beginning is a bit awkwardly done, and if you stand on the letter of the law, so to speak, you will find fault (as many have, see more reviews) but if you can view the film for what it does offer, there is much to be enjoyed. (Other than Piper's hair; pretty, but shockingly improper for a regency miss!) And Hayley Atwell does a tantalizing Mary Crawford though her forwardness in the film would have forewarned the devout Edmund long before the scriptwriters allowed him to catch on to her true nature here. Her facial mannerisms are so well-done that she comes across rather likeable, despite her faults. Poor Fannie is good, to be sure, but more child-like than Austen intended, and her good choices seem to come more from a strong childish passion rather than sense or strong wits. Nevertheless, you will be drawn in and swept along to a strong ending that is great fun. (And I do love fun--or I wouldn't be a regency romance author.)",1201996800,10,1436,4.627450980392157
3037762,1,B000Z27HMW,"The beauty of Mansfield Park the novel is that Fanny is the perfect narrator - discounted by all as a 'no body', she is perfectly situated to observe and report all the events occuring around her.

A movie based on someone who is a 'no body', who nothing really happens to other than some mild bullying and a lame attempt at a seduction will never work. It's my opinion that Mansfield Park as a film would only work if the character of Fanny is either ""sexed up"", melded with attributes of other Austen characters, or dispensed of entirely. Which of course, would not please Austen fans.

So, please do not waste your time or money by purchasing this film - you would be better off by reading the actual novel, and then watching ""Pride and Prejudice"" or Emma Thompson's ""Sense and Sensibility"".

3037766,1,B000Z27HMW,"As an Austen scholar, I was bracing myself for something that would take liberties with the novel, but it seems that the screenwriter must surely have read only the Cliff notes. Even then, the early part's first-person narrative made me wonder if s/he had picked up her abbreviated version of Jane Eyre instead. An estate called Mansfield Park is indeed involved, but that's about as close it gets.

Even such a massive rewrite might have been tolerable with some accurate historical research, but there are SO many funny mistakes in the representation of both the characters and the period that it was hard to believe this production could appear on (the program once known as) Masterpiece Theatre.

One could hardly determine which was longer and bounced more--Fanny's full and unbound hair or her full and nearly unbound cleavage, as the charity-case companion races shrieking and laughing through the estate. Nor should you look for the novel's complacent, drowsy, plump Lady Bertram (for whom so many have a secret affection); the beautiful but miscast Jemma Redgrave presents an elegant, intelligent mother with sharp insight.

But there's worse. When Henry Crawford drags Maria behind the curtain and declares himself her lover as they grope and grab, I nearly gagged; and when Edmund sits next to a sprawling Fanny after the picnic (no ball) and tells her how lovely she looks, I did gag. Plus, Fanny's absolutely central visit to Portsmith is axed. I don't mind streamlining when the end product is smooth and historically and literarily accurate, but this production was jumpy and jumbled.

When the whole thing finally closes with a WALTZ in 1810, it was I who was shrieking with laughter--eveyone knows that dance did not come out until 20 years later and THEN was considered very racy; certainly not something a reserved clergyman from the upper classes would have initiated at his rural Tory wedding. Good lord, who wrote this mess anyway, Barbara Cartland?

Which is a real shame, because the marvelous actors and actresses (except for the lovely Miss Redgrave) looked right for their parts--and I'm sure we'll see them again in hopefully better material. But let's face it, folks; modern screenwriters are just too terrified of frail, gentle Fanny to bring her to us as Austen created her.",1201564800,120,2305,5.039370078740157
3037767,1,B000Z27HMW,"As an ardent Jane Austen fan, I shuddered with horror at this production. It  bore little resemblance to the book. I can't begin to write about how wrong everything was, so I'll keep my comments to a few of the main characters.

Instead of a shy, retiring, timid, somewhat delicate Fanny Price we get a robust serving wench of a girl - all bosoms and teeth with wildchild hair. The difference between Jane Austen's Fanny and her cousins is intended to compare a poor girl with uncompromising moral principles to a group of worldly, indolent young people who pursue pleasure unencumbered by such principles. (Even the steady, religious-minded Edmund goes off course; Fanny - never.)

In this production, I saw a healthy, active girl who bounces about. She takes part in the play staged by the Bertram children and their friends the Crawfords and runs shrieking and grabbing people at a picnic. The Fanny in the book refuses to take part in the play, even when asked by her beloved cousin because it's against her morals. Somehow I can't imagine Ms. Austen intended her to be the life of the party at a picnic. Thus a most important theme in the book is lost.

Aunt Bertram seemed to become a somewhat shrewd character instead of the woman who would plaintively ask others what she should think and who would placidly agree with stronger personalities. Lady Bertram is supposed to an example of egoistic indolence and sloth. In her, Jane Austen creates a satirical stereotype of manners and customs.

Aunt Norris, that selfish busybody who's persecution of Fanny and blind adoration of Maria underscores her foolishness fades in importance. She should be characterized by meanness, officiousness and sycophancy towards the powerful, and bullying of anyone she perceives to be in her power - such as Fanny. She was a key character in Jane Austen's story.

I won't go into all the scenes left out or changed in this production. And the very important themes lost - does Sir Thomas' business in the West Indies involve the slave trade? (Or the unique, rather bizarre ones added to it.) I guess this adaptation was an attempt to ""modernize"" the story by introducing an inordinate amount of sexual tension and removing the wit and sting of Jane Austen's writing.

If you are a serious Jane Austen fan, don't watch this. It's truly awful, a powerful example of how wrong things can go when you take a classic and remove its soul.",1201564800,52,2421,4.7913669064748206
3037768,1,B000Z27HMW,"I had high hope for this series and particularly this installment as I so love the book.  Thusfar each of the first three episodes suffer from the impossibility of condensing a rich period novel into 90 minutes.  There is no real chemistry between Edmund and Fanny--- and since there is so little time for any real character development that is crucial to making this piece work.

The concept behind the series--- creating collection of Jane Austen films-- was wonderful. But why not full blown, authentic, quality productions instead of 90 minute tv movies?",1201478400,9,558,4.978494623655914
3037769,2,B000Z27HMW,"There has yet to be a successful adaptation of Mansfield Park. I was hoping PBS, of all people, would produce something akin to tolerable for Austen fans, but this is yet another disappointment. I agree with the other reviewers that the first half was very choppy. I think the adapters were trying to rush through elements of the story that they feel are problematic - primarily the play business, which is even confusing in the novel if you're unaware of social context.

But why can't anyone do justice to poor Fanny Price? Even many fans dislike her as a character but she is one of my favorites. I find this version's Fanny very strange, she spends most of her time chasing small children and dogs, much to the puzzlement of all and seems to have some hair styling issues. Jane's Fanny is a waif who never moves faster than a slow crawl, unless atop a horse and then I'm sure never faster than a trot. She's described as unattractive and forgettable, a perpetual martyr, and definitely something less than a true part of the Bertram family. She's painfully shy and terrified of Mr. Betram, though she does love him as a father.

And lastly, I find the portrayal of Mrs. Bertram utterly laughable! To imply that she's so observant and attached so dearly to Fanny is ridiculous. The novel's Mrs. Betram is a dreadfully lazy moron who spends all her time getting Fanny to do her needlework for her (especially the difficult bits) and sleeping. She treats Fanny as a servant and gives her a cold unheated bedroom to live in. She evens tries to pawn her off on Aunt Norris (though Norris treats Fanny even worse than the Betrams and luckily Fanny's spared this fate).

The simple truth is that most film adapters are afraid the public won't like Fanny Price and maybe they're right. Everyone always says Jane Austen endures because her characters are relatable, even a hundred years later, but maybe Mansfield Park can't make the transition. Unfortunately, most filmmakers have been too afraid to even try.",1201478400,16,2005,4.722857142857142
3037770,2,B000Z27HMW,"To be honest I haven't cared for any of the adaptations that I've seen of Mansfield Park.  This one stands alone in sheer awfulness though.  Billie Piper was a bad miscast, and while the acting in general was good, the screenplay badly lets Jane and the viewer down with some very stupid alterations to the story.  To save time, a lot of the action takes place off screen and then the characters discuss it.  The characters were altered, some beyond recognition.  The Aunt Norris character was the most egregious example of this.  Instead of being a greedy, selfish, ill-natured, hateful bitch, she's comes off as more bored than boorish, and seems more lazy and vague than Aunt Bertram, who actually seems to have an attention span and some saving graces in this adaptation.  Nothing ever seems to be explained, and if viewers were not familiar with the original novel, they would be totally confused with this mess.  The costumes seemed off, for the women, although the men's were generally good.  I so wanted to like this one, because I tossed out the one with Ms Le TOuzel, which I found meandering and coma-inducing. I also found her performance screechy and juvenile.  The Frances O'Connor version was my least favorite until this one.  Not any more!  That one actually looks almost acceptable compared to this steaming, craptacular pile of inept mediocrity.  If you haven't seen this yet, don't bother.  You won't have missed anything but a good case of irritation.  I found Ms. Piper underwhelming at best, and as another reviewer noted, her blonde hair and black brows were discordant, as was her unbound, messy hair.  She looked more like a  blowsy serving wench than the cousin and niece of a great family.  Mansfield Park was never my favorite Austen, and with adaptations like this, it won't change any time soon.  I really looked forward to seeing this, and now I'm afraid to watch the Masterpiece series again, because of what atrocity they will foist on us the next time.",1201478400,12,1987,4.808259587020649
3037771,3,B000Z27HMW,"Jane Austen's unique romantic drama Mansfield Park is perhaps a little too long and complicated to be faithfully reproduced in a single episode television production, and that may be the major challenge for this Masterpiece Theater version.

Billie Piper is an interesting choice to play Fanny Price, a poor relation of the wealthy Bertram family.  She is invited to live with the family at Mansfield Park, but is treated as something of a glorified servant and expected to be grateful.  Her one friend in the household is her kindly cousin Edmund (Blake Ritson).

As the story gets properly underway, the rhythm of life at Mansfield Park is upset by two events, the departure of patriarch Sir Thomas to tend to family properties in Antigua, and the arrival of Henry and Mary Crawford.  Henry and Mary are presented as worldly schemers who plan to marry the most eligible of the Bertram clan and claim a share of the family fortune.  The absence of Sir Thomas allows them to gain undue influence over the young adults in the household.  Henry pursues the already engaged eldest daughter, while Mary flashes her considerable charm at Edmund.

Fanny suffers in silence as her Edmund is distracted by Mary.  Her life is further complicated when the untrustworthy Henry makes a surprise marriage proposal, and Fanny is placed under great pressure by the returned Sir Thomas to accept.  Fanny's dilemma sets up a rather dramatic ending...

This shortened version of the original story results in a choppy delivery and a loss of the some of the subtlety of the plot.  Most of the minor characters get minimal screen time.  The ending is not bad, but it doesn't really project the moral challenge presented to Fanny, or her courage in resolving it.  Cautiously recommended.",1201478400,,1766,4.922297297297297
3037772,1,B000Z27HMW,"The sheer unadulterated awfulness of this absolutely amazes me.  Fanny Price as a flirty, pouty,  bosoms almost falling out, bottle blonde with bed hair and  an acting style straight out of  ""Tom Jones""  pretty much ruins the whole thing singlehandedly. The intended villainess, Mary Crawford, looks downright demure by comparison and a far more suitable match for a clergyman.  Then there's the inconsistent  uncle  who starts out  Simon Legree and ends up Father Knows Best.  And the otherwise adequate and attractive  actor playing Edmund who's given about 15 seconds of close-up across the family breakfast table to show, with just his face,  the aha! moment when he realizes it's Fanny he loves after all.  That  scene alone may end up  earning  this movie a place in  the so-bad-it's-funny pile. I don't think Jane Austen is turning in her grave; I think she's laughing herself silly at the ludicrousness of it all.",1201478400,36,921,4.993377483443709
3037773,4,B000Z27HMW,"It seems that Jane Austen fans really can't get a good ""Mansfield Park.""  The 1990s version with Frances O'Connor was truer to the plot (minus the added scenes taken from Austen's bio), but altered the spirit and mood of the book as much as it possibly could.  This new version plays fast and loose with the plot, but stays truer to the original intent.

I gave it four stars because even though I'm an obsessive Austen fan, Mansfield Park is by far my least favorite novel, and I think that at least some of the changes made improved on the novel (blasphemy, I know) while still remaining true to the spirit of Jane Austen's story.

The saving grace of this adaptation is Billie Piper's Fanny Price.  I wasn't sure about the casting, because physically they're such opposites.  Billie Piper is full of life and zest, while Fanny ought to be a pale, thin creature who looks as though a gust of wind could blow her away.  But try though I might, I just can't like Fanny until about half way through the book.  Timid, meek, shy, and any other synonymn for it that you can find in the thesaurus; unappreciated by the family that simultaneously depends on her to supply most of their emotional and practical wants and needs; unrequitedly in love with a cousin that sees her as his little sister; and physically weak enough that she's easily exhausted and nearly falls ill after being deprived of her daily exercise of horse-riding for a week, Fanny in the novel seems a creature to be pitied rather than liked.  Billie Piper's character has a gentle and domestic but still very present sense of humor to her, which I think is just what that character needed.  It makes her easily likable, without departing from the shyness and home-bound-ness that form the core of Fanny's character.  Also, seeing Fanny in the beginning truly happy with her family life (inspite of her underapprecation and a little pining for Edmund) before the Crawfords come makes the story that much more appealing and her situation much more moving.  Fanny's life in the book consists of almost unmitigated misery.  She's always a little homesick for her parents and siblings, even though she's been away too long for anyone besides William to be really family anymore.  She's overworked by Lady Bertram, who means no harm but is too lazy to notice what she's doing, constantly tormented and slighted by Aunt Norris, nearly despairing in her love for Edmund, ignored by her other cousins, terrified of her uncle, and tormented by constant guilt and shame that she does not love enough or feel enough gratitude for these people who have such little affection for her.  When the Crawfords upset the balance of her life, it just seems more misery steeped on top of what's already there.

I also liked Fanny's decision to ask for a picnic instead of a ball.  It's easier to appreciate a shy woman's preference for an easy and playful family gathering instead of a fancy formal party than to feel sympathy for a heroine, however painfully shy, whose suffers through the horrible experience of having her wealthy family throw a ball in her honor.  And I like that we get to see Fanny playing with children.  I don't think Jane Austen liked children much; her comments on them are very sharp in all her books, and even moreso in her letters.  But Fanny's love of children adds real dimension to her controlling desire to make houses into homes, and as much as I understand how hard it must be to inhabit a home with a large number of mainly spoiled and undisciplined children after growing up in an environment so formal as to be sterile, Fanny's painfilled reaction when she visits her parents in the book and is constantly unsettled by their loud brood of wild and active children makes it harder for me to like her, especially since her ambition is to fulfill a domestic role.  How is she to be a mother if she can't bear noise and naughty behavior?  I guess I just don't like delicate flowers very much.  Billie Piper's Fanny is tweaked just enough to prevent her from being one.

There were some changes I didn't like.  Fanny's decision to stick to her guns about not performing in the play was the one thing I liked about her in the early chapters of the book.  It redeemed her character for me that as much as she may mistrust her own judgements, she at least had the courage of her convictions where she believed a moral code was at stake.  That Fanny let's herself be talked into participating in the movie tarnishes her character for me.

Mrs. Norris is barely horrid at all in this version, and I think that even if you are going to soften her character, she needs to be at least as annoying as Lady Catherine De Bourgh to do justice to her character.  And while the actors playing the Crawfords did wonderful jobs with the material they were given, I still felt something was missing.  Henry and Mary Crawford are the most interesting characters in the novel, even though they are too selfish for us to want them to get with the heroes.  The juxtaposition of their long habits of bad behavior with the desire and potential to be good shown by their loving the two most moral characters of the play is something that could and should have been played with more.  Neither movie version I've seen makes enough of the real affection Mary had for Fanny as well, though this one comes much closer than the '90s version.

On more minor details, Sir Thomas was a little too inconsistant, playing too cruel at some points and too warm at others, with little gradation or reasons given for the changes.  Lady Bertram's warmth added some nice depth and likability to her character, without seriously undermining her overall laziness, unwillingness to think beyond her own comfort, and dependance on her husband that are her distinguishing traits.  The change of Fanny's being sent home for her being abandoned in an empty Mansfield Park was regrettable, but excusable for the simplification it brought.  The styling of Fanny's hair has been much complained about; but since lose hair was allowed for children and for the lower classes at the time, and since it was paired with comparatively old-fashioned and cheap clothing for Fanny versus the other characters, I viewed it as symbolic of both her sweet and simple personality, and her family's refusal to think of Fanny as enough of a woman and a lady to need to put her hair up:  to them she's still the poor peasant girl they've adopted.  And anyway, it's pretty.

Edmund was excellent:  more likable and interesting than in the book, and the sudden shift of his affection onto Fanny was both played and writted believably and adorably, again more so than it was in the book.

I can't help concluding, though, that we're still waiting for an adaptation that will manage to do all three:  be true to Austen's plot, true to Austen's spirit, and yet still believable and engaging for a modern audience.  Difficult as the book is to adapt, I think it could be done with the right vision; and maybe it would even be possible to find an interpretation at once so true and so good that it would send me back into the book with new eyes, ready to enjoy this great work of Jane's as much as I do the other five that she left us.",1201392000,11,7236,4.6203125
3037774,1,B000Z27HMW,"While Mansfield Park is not the most appealing of the Austen novels, it deserved a better effort than this latest version. Most fans of Austen have read the original books, so we understand much of the manners, custom and dress of the times, and have certain expectations. Other reviewers have pointed out the problems, and I agree with them. I also could not get past Fanny's appearance (which was more like a bar maid than even a servant) to have any empathy for the character. I did not understand the director's decision to dress everyone else in the piece for the period and not the main character. Keeping every scene in one spot and mostly in the same room might have been cost effective but hardly does justice to the richer world that Austen was so adept at portraying. Although I own most DVD versions of other Austen productions, I know I will not want to see this again. My recommendation is to watch it on PBS or rent it before you buy.",1201392000,72,949,4.491329479768786
3037775,2,B000Z27HMW,"This is not Jane Austen's ""Mansfield Park""--it's another story altogether, from another place and time.  The first, and establishing portion, of the novel has completely disappeared, the themes of the Austen book have vanished, the language is pure 21st century, and the characters, their bearing and their manners bear no resemblance to the originals--the actors just happen to be wearing Regency garb.

I would have no objection to, and would in fact enjoy, watching a good melodrama decked out in 18th century costumes--just don't try to tell me that this is ""Mansfield Park.""",1201392000,44,579,5.21505376344086
3037776,4,B000Z27HMW,"All of the novels in the new BBC series so far have been altered, jumbled, and severely cut to fit within the confines of approximately 90 minutes of screen time. ""Mansfield Park"" suffers further from oddities in casting: Billie Piper, though plain enough and believably pious, is far too lively a character for Fannie, and Blake Ritson is much too handsome for Edmund. One of Jane Austen's consistent points is that her heroes and heroines are not strikingly handsome, but only near it and, as is psychologically sound, become better looking as their characters are revealed to their potential suitors. Ritson would have better fitted Austen's vision if he'd been cast as Henry Crawford. Beautiful, but depraved Mary Crawford, on the other hand, is perfectly cast.

 Apart from the weak points just mentioned, I think ""Mansfield Park"" the best of the series so far. It's the truest to Jane Austen's vision. Thus we have retained here the corruption of the witty, attractive, big city young people set against the relative paleness of the conventional country dwellers, Fanny and Edmund, who've internalized the values that represent the best of the Mansfield life. Never simple in confounding virtue with mere geography, Austen as well as her adapters here shows the parental failure of Mansfield's Sir Thomas in having overseen only his daughter's manners, not their moral education. Corruption can bloom then in the countryside as well as in the big city.

The novel ""Mansfield Park,"" which is the favorite of high-Janeites, turns on the conflict between cleverness and goodness. In most of Jane Austen, a combination of both qualities in the main characters is the ideal. Think Elizabeth Bennett or Elinor Dashwood. Here, though, push comes to shove, and the author's judgment is that in a conflict comparatively dull goodness is vastly preferable to witty heartlessness. Happily, the TV adaptation has had the courage to remain true to the author's values.",1201305600,10,1961,5.141065830721003
3037777,3,B000Z27HMW,"Of the three iTV 90-minute films done this year, Mansfield Park is my least favorite:
Persuasion and Northanger Abbey were just much better done (even with their faults & foibles).  As always, there is not a great adaptation of Mansfield Park available: the 80's version is fairly true to the book, but that Fanny is not my favorite in casting: the 90's version is too modernernized, and this one again, just ends up missing the mark.  For one, the story is too much condensed, with so much being left out, that I was almost shocked, for one, to have met Mr Rushworth within the first 4 minutes of the film.

The casting of Billie Piper worked out somewhat: she does a good job of being active of mind and body, but never quite gets the tone of humbleness and quiet servitude which should also accompany this, in the person of Fanny Price.  Her blond hair hanging loose and wild (it's never up in a proper Regency hairdo) is far too unrealistic for me, to what would have been expected of a young Regency woman, poor dependent or not (I'm sorry, but her hair would have always been up or pulled back!  EXCEPT maybe when she's in her own bedroom).  Blake Ritson as Edmund is fine casting, as well as Hayley Atwell as Mary Crawford, Joseph Beattie as Henry Crawford, and Jemma Redgrave as Lady Betram.  I found the whole story a bit rushed and stilted, and it seemed to be a whirlwind: if I, avid reader of Jane Austen, had trouble following the storyline, how much more so would someone who had not read the book?

Content: there are some things to be aware of: some cleavage is shown, sexual innuendos, an engaged woman kisses a man who is not her fianc, there is talk of a scandal where a married woman runs off with another man, a scene where a woman is washing her hair in a basin and a man comes in to talk with her, there is not much else: it is pretty tame.

Although it was a bit of a disappointment, I can appreciate certain moments in the film, where the fine acting of some shines through, and with good costuming to eye and things along that line, it is an enjoyable way to wile away 90 minutes: not up to par they way that I would have hoped, but all in all, and enjoyable version of Mansfield Park until one better comes along.",1199836800,64,2240,4.339712918660287
3037778,4,B000Z27HMW,"This may not be the perfect adaptation fans have been waiting for, but for a low-budget production, it wasn't too bad. The casting was nearly perfect, though Billie Piper may not have been ideal for Fanny. She still did a decent job pulling off the role. Edmund, Mary, Mr. Bertram, and Mrs. Norris were all superb in this film! Mrs. Bertram was altered slightly from the book, but I thought it was for the better.

SPOILERS BELOW!!
Just like all low-budget productions, scenes and characters from the book were cut. Most I could accept, like not visiting the Price family. But I do wish they had kept the ball in. Instead they changed it to a picnic. Also they didn't have Henry Crawford leave before Maria was married, making the scene between her and Mr. Bertram (where Maria insists on marrying Mr. Rushworth despite the easy out her father is offering her) confusing and gives Maria a poorer character than in the book.

Overall, this adaptation was decent. Certainly better than the terrible '97 movie.",1198368000,28,1007,4.748571428571428
3271905,3,B000Z27HMW,"It is a truth universally acknowledged that Jane Austen fans have yet to find an adaptation of ""Mansfield Park"" that truly does justice to the novel.  ""Pride & Prejudice"" and ""Persuasion"" have their share of successes, with the 1995 versions and the recent versions having (for the most part) become instant classics and fan favorites.  But not so for poor ""Mansfield Park.""

I wanted so badly to love this version, especially with all the press hoopla surrounding the casting of Billie Piper (Dr. Who). The 1980s version starring Sylvestra Le Touzel remains the most faithful adaptation of the book, but has become outdated, is slow moving and tends to drag in places. The 1990s version starring Frances O'Connor is an anathema to Austen purists. This is Mansfield Park in name only, and is a slap on the face for true fans of the book. In short, Janeites were ready for a new and improved adaptation of ""Mansfield Park.""

Sadly though, this new version falls short of expectations. If you have not read the book, then you will probably like it. If you have - and especially if you count yourself as an Austen purist - then there are many aspects of this version that you may find irritating (or worse..).

I dislike starting my reviews on a negative note, but I was disappointed with this one. Among the shortcomings are as follows (warning - SPOILERS):

- Casting of Billie Piper and Maggie O'Neill. Personally, I find Billie's blonde hair and dark eyebrows very distracting and far too modern for a period piece. Ladies in the Regency era tied their hair back in a bun but the filmmakers totally disregarded this and left Billie to run around like a wild child instead of a proper Regency lady.  I also took issue to Maggie O'Neill who was not quite the right age and was a tad too ""fine looking"" as the widow Mrs. Norris.
- Very choppy beginning. It almost feels like the first half hour is filmed in hand-held camera.  It is annoying and gave me a headache.
- Too many scenes were altered or omitted entirely. Many characters do not even make an appearance.  There is no visit to the Price family home in Portsmouth; no visit to the Rushworth home; Maria and Julia Bertram disappear in the second act, when Maria and Rushworth marry; Maria and Julia Bertram and Mr. Yates are mere cyphers and don't have much to do; other than William Price, all the other Prices (including Susan) are absent in this story...and the list goes on.
- Scenes jump around and there is little coherence to the screenplay. Novices to the story will be confused (especially in the beginning) as new characters come and go, there is little character development and no fluidity as the scenes move from one to another.  Everything in the first act is rushed and you feel like the filmmakers are trying to cram hundreds of pages of storyline into the first half hour.

There is, however, a light at the end of the tunnel.  The story does improve as you go along and the last half hour provides some memorable highlights.  Blake Ritson's Edmund proves to be swoon-worthy in some key (romantic) scenes from the book.  The 'thunderbolt' scene (you will know what I mean when you see it) up until the end is certainly worth seeing.  Jemma Redgrave's Lady Bertram also does some scene stealing of her own.

Most of the cast are perfect for their roles.  Blake Ritson is quite dashing (in a solemn, Byronic way) and handsome as Edmund Bertram and Joe Beattie makes for a charming and attractive Henry Crawford.  Jemma Redgrave, Douglas Hodge (Sir Thomas Bertram), Hayley Atwell (Mary Crawford), Michelle Ryan (Maria Bertram) and others are well cast.  Hayley Atwell shines as the scheming, manipulative and lovely Mary Crawford. Jemma Redgrave's portrayal of Lady Bertram is a change from the book, but I actually liked it.  She gave an otherwise bland character added dimension and some warmth.  Douglas Hodge (a veteran of British period dramas) is excellent as always.

All in all, this version has a bumpy beginning but a much improved second act, overall good casting, mediocre screenplay and what appears to be a relatively low budget (all of the scenes were filmed in one location - yes, no kidding).  If you want a more faithful adaptation of Mansfield Park, look to the 1980s version starring Sylvestra Le Touzel and Nicholas Farrell (who, incidently, play Mrs. Allen and Mr. Musgrove in the new versions of ""Northanger Abbey"" and ""Persuasion"", respectively).

Of the 3 recent Austen tv adaptations, this is my least favorite. For my choices in the recent Masterpiece Theater dramas, my vote goes to ""Northanger Abbey"" with ""Persuasion"" a distant second.  I have yet to see the new version of ""Sense & Sensibility"" so I will reserve judgement until then.  This ""Mansfield Park"" is certainly worth a viewing, just make sure to keep your expectations in check.",1197936000,283,4840,4.773381294964029

Chiefly missing from this movie is Jane Austen as satirist, as with her brilliant treatment in the novel of Mrs. Norris, who scarcely emerges in this film at all. The section with Fannie gone home to Portsmouth, and the important contrasts in her home with Mansfield Park is also missing. A movie such as this is best looked at as ""based on."" In a sense it tells a slightly different story, especially for the diligent or scholarly viewer eager to test it against the original. Having said all that, this film is well acted, especially with its excellent ending, which may even surpass Jane's ending itself! It's also vivid in photography and very pleasing with its music.

3272008,1,B000Z27HMW,"^ **Quotes from Edmund, chapters 15 & 16.**

According to the description, ""Mansfield Park (is) one of Austen's most complex plots....""-- so much so that the writers apparently gave up in their efforts to retell this (now 200 year old) tale before they even started! (I can scarcely believe Rebecca Eaton *exec. producer* was involved with production!!)

I really hate to give anything associated with Jane Austen 1 star, being I'm an immense fan of her works, and many of the adaptations of them. But the adage to not judge a book by its movie certainly applies in this case! While I can't say it's Jane Austen's best book (it's personally my least favorite out of her 6 main novels), this adaptation does the book almost zero justice!

To the script writers, did they even read this book?! ""Fanny"" could easily pass for ""Lydia"" or ""Kitty (the 2 youngest ""Bennet"" sisters) with her fits of giggles, carefree spirit, bluntness, and lack of depth of emotion (where was Fanny's nerves & tears?!). ""Edmund"" is entirely too flirtatious with ""Fanny""; the viewer is left to wonder who he's more in love with (not so in the book)! There really isn't a standout performance in the whole lot (obviously because there was hardly any time to develop the characters, or the storyline).
The acting mostly goes from bad to worse (echoing Edmunds above estimation of the ""Lovers Vows"" play); which is a bit baffling because I've seen most of the actors in other roles, and thought them pretty good. Much of it is juvenile, and cringeworthy.
The beginning few minutes (the play rehearsal with Maria Bertram, and Mr. Crawford), and the last 8 minutes (with Fanny & Edmund)- I can imagine Jane reaching for her smelling salts at the sight!

The pace at which this production breezes through the 48 chapter book makes your head spin! Actually, being that 90% of the events are skipped, made up, mish-mashed, or extremely condensed-- I guess they can set their own pace.

I'm trying to think of some redeeming qualities of this production.. Other than some nice scenery, stately houses, and a few pretty costumes (minus the distracting low-cut bodices & heaving bosoms in almost every scene), there's not much depth here.

In conclusion, my advice would be to skip this Harlequin-esque imitation, and read the book!

**Side note**
The story of ""Mansfield Park"" has only been given 2 previous adaptation attempts. The BBC miniseries in the 80's, which I've only seen a few minutes of. Although rather lengthy (about 6 hrs.), and ""stagey"" like most BBC productions of that era, I have plans to definitely check it out. From what I hear though, it's a painstakingly accurate adaptation.

As for the '99 movie, that too isn't faithfully accurate (I'd say it's about 75%.. although missing a major character- William *Fanny's older brother*).
I decided to view it a 3'd time after reading the book. I finally understand what they did! In the beginning it says that it's also based on Jane's personal writings. What they don't tell you, is that they've essentially merged Jane Austen herself, with Fanny Price. While I can't say that I hate what they did (as far as entertainment value goes), it does give the viewer a different idea of how Miss Austen wrote her in the book. I guess because the book character is so introverted/introspective, and not as lively, or witty as JA's other heroines, the creators felt the need to do this? (And no, Fanny was not ever an aspiring writer, that was all Jane Austen there.)
The last quarter- excepting the final few minutes- are the most changed from the book, so for a better understanding you may want to read chapters 39-48.",1416096000,,3643,4.8083067092651754

While most of the plot points are there the main characters are off, especially Billy Piper as Fanny, way, way off. They are also missing some crucial scenes perhaps because the entire movie takes place at Mansfield Park.

If you just want to see a fun period style romance with lovely surroundings this is a good choice. It really is like a current historical romance novel made into a really great movie. If I had seen it with that expectation I think I would have thoroughly enjoyed it.

If you want to see an adaptation of Mansfield Park don't buy it, rent it ....come on even knowing it's a horrible version you're going  to have to see it for yourself. I'll warn you now Fanny Brice's character is a hoyden, with flying hair, low cut dresses, running from room to room like a child; she even invites Edmund into her bedroom when she is washing her hair and in her nightgown.

So watch it and enjoy it as what it is, a modern day historical romance. If it had hadn't claimed to be ""Mansfield Park"" I would have given it 4 stars but since it did I gave it 3.",1395014400,,1178,4.316742081447964

Billie Piper's Fanny is lively and wild and a bottle blonde - who's eyebrows don't match - but that is trivial. She does a great job conveying Fanny's not so concealed love for her cousin Edmond. No frills or special features on the DVD - its basic but very nice. I like the guys; nice job on the casting! Joseph Morgan (Hex, The Vampire Diaries and The Originals) Mmmmm-hmmm!

Why didn't they at the very least make the movie a bit longer to help with character development?!  I had never read the novel or seen any other movie rendition, so I decided to do some research.  I watched the 1999 version with Johnny Lee Miller (also from the 2009 ""Emma""), and I was disappointed. I was, also, totally confused; the two versions were so different, and I had no clue what Fanny Brice was supposed to be like.  Then I read the novel.  Ahhhh!  It was actually a great story, and the characters suddenly made sense.  Reading the book left me even more disappointed with this movie.  I stumbled across the 1983 miniseries version with Sylvestra Le Touzel.  While the production quality wasn't spectacular, the telling of the story was. I recommend the 1983 mini series or the novel.

My problem with this version is that it stays at Mansfield Park forever!  For me, some of the most emotionally intense moments were at Portsmouth and at Mr. Rushworth's estate, and those portions just never happen in the movie.

Often what the play writes do to trim down the originals is to create a crib note version, what they did in the Billie Piper version is create a crib note version of a crib note version, thus deleting every single nuance to this wonderful novel.
I like Billie Piper, and I find her to be a very pretty young actress, but what they tried to do here is to fit a 21st century beauty into an 18th century story...and they failed.

They played their roles with perfection and subtlety. The same is easily said concerning the rest of the actors. I especially enjoyed the choice for Edmund. I now have a new character to imagine and adore from his phenomenal acting. Even with the amazing choices concerning cast, it still could not make this movie fantastic. It started with the camera shaking while the characters walked. I found the to be especially annoying. There were also the poor choices of editing in the script. They deleted characters, altered events, Maria and Julia disappear, and it didn't even let the picture leave Mansfield. The lack of budget shows, especially from that. There were also a few other nitpicks that I was annoyed by, but not overly disgruntled by (such as Billie not bothering to have her eyebrows match her hair.)

It was really well acted and if you have read the book, you just brought it into a better understanding.

On the cusp of womanhood, she finds herself loosing the one man she secretly loves only to be sought after another whom she does not trust.  There is a bit more to it than that but this is my quick sum of the movie plot.

From the beginning, the script felt rushed.  While I understand not every movie can afford to be three hours long, I do feel there were too many pivotal character scenes completely cut for the sake of time.  As a result, you can see the potential but also see how much it fell short of all it could have offered.

Still in terms of acting, I felt the actors did well with what they had to work with and they did not seem overly cheesy or robotic. Also, some of the scenes display some rather stunning views of the land.  In the end, however, not even the actors could hide the short falls of the script.

I would recommend watching it at least once if you are looking for a period movie, but if you are trying to decide on which version of the Mansfield Park movies to own - this would be my second choice - my first being the 1999 version (I have yet to watch the 1983 TV series version).",1362614400,2,1274,4.064

If you have actually read Mansfield Park, its long and a little dull, and Fanny is not the most likeable character. The 80s adaptation might have been more accurate, but its also boring, Fanny is irritatingly mousey and nervous, and the sets, sound and light are painfully low budget.
This is a beautifully filmed production and has a wonderful cast. It is my favorite film from the recent Masterpiece adaptions of the JA books. But I watched it on Youtube recently and saw that the version posted there had scenes that are missing from our US version. Those scenes do add more to the story and I am curious why the US version cut them. There were many scenes that showed Aunt Norris' meanness towards Fanny, showed Fanny asking her uncle about slavery, showed more of Edmund's distress about/with Miss Crawford, and just further fleshed out the characters. I wish the filmmakers had included Fanny's trip to her family home in Portsmouth, but to fit the film into a more marketable length, I suppose they had to revise the plot somewhat and leave out some characters. I love the ending, I love Lady Bertram (she is less of a dope head here) and I loved Billie and Blake together. They expressed the  growing admiration and love so beautifully.

3272112,1,B000Z27HMW,"This is inexcusable!  First of all, they carefully cast all the characters extremely well, except Fanny, the central character- just ridiculous!  Fanny has to exude quiet intelligence which has not been given its due because of the combination of a shy nature and the way she has been treated or there is no point to the story.  Secondly, they have telescoped the story into an hour and a half by eliminating most of Jane Austen's best dialogue which is exactly what makes the story so worthwhile. This is not a tale that can be told though a series of occurrences which the screenwriter attempted.  It is painful to watch.  If only they had cast Fanny properly, the production would have been tolerable!

A word about the aunts- they are pretty much one-dimensional archtypes in the book.  The movie humanizes indolent Aunt Bertram especially in the end which is probably a good thing although it is done inconsistently and clumsily- the idea would have been to keep the idea of the detached, spoiled, unproductive  upper class without being totally dehumanizing.  On the other hand, the removal of the mean spirited, better-than-thou edginess of Aunt Norris with an attractive, bland character was, well, a stupid way of undermining the whole theme of the book- yes, the book may have indeed been a bit too repetitive without added dimension, but her role is pivotal and needed to be kept in some form.",1339286400,8,1404,4.841004184100418

3272114,2,B000Z27HMW,A poor production of an excellent novel of Jane Austen's. No comparison to the other movies I've seen such as Sense and Sensibility.,1336089600,3,132,4.782608695652174
3272115,4,B000Z27HMW,"Jane Austen fans have certainly been spoiled of late, for between 2007-2009, the BBC and ITV commissioned brand new versions of ""Sense and Sensibility"", ""Northanger Abbey"", ""Persuasion"", ""Emma"", and this MANSFIELD PARK.  The BBC's previous miniseries version in 1983 I would single out as being one of the most faithfully-drawn and utterly delightful; whilst a 1999 big-screen version retained precious little of the original Austen story except for the title.  This 2007 version I'd place somewhere in the middle.

Viewing all of these new Austen adaptations recently, it's come to my notice that all of them have tried to appeal to new viewers by casting the stories with popular younger talents.  In MANSFIELD PARK, former pop singer and ""Dr Who"" heroine Billie Piper stars as Fanny Price, the put-upon young orphan who goes to live with rich relations, the Bertrams of Mansfield Park.

At Mansfield Park, Fanny is regarded as the poor relation and is expected to comply with their every wish.  Only Edmund Bertram (Blake Ritson - 2009's ""Emma"" and ""Upstairs Downstairs"") treats her with the regard he shows his other siblings.  When Sir Thomas Bertram (Douglas Hodge) is called away to Antigua on urgent business, the Bertrams fall prey to the manipulations of their new neighbours, Mary Crawford (Hayley Atwell - ""The Sally Lockhart Mysteries"") and her brother Henry (Joseph Beattie).  Whilst Henry's quest to lure away the soon-to-be-married Maria (Michelle Ryan) is underway, Mary finds Edmund more challenging.  Upon Sir Thomas' return, Fanny is shocked to learn that the Bertrams wish her to marry Henry - despite what she has observed of his blatant seduction of Maria.  Once again, only Edmund is there to offer a comforting shoulder, but the events about to unfold will cause the Bertrams to view Fanny in an entirely new light...

There are two big stumbling blocks with this version of MANSFIELD PARK.  One is the length: there's a reason why the last BBC miniseries approached 6 hours in total.  One cannot enjoy the subtleties in Austen's original tale when everything is alarmingly sped up (and many important plot points chopped out) in order to tell the story in 93 minutes.  The other objection may be Billie Piper's casting as Fanny.  She isn't the Fanny from the novel at all, running around the gardens, talking back to Aunt Norris; not to mention that her blonde hair teamed with black eyebrows hardly fits the period.

Fanny is supposed to be meek, compliant and so devoted to her family at Mansfield Park that, at one point, she seriously considers going through with the marriage to Henry because she cannot bear to make them unhappy or worse, make them think she is ungrateful.  Although I eventually warmed to Ms Piper in the role, I believe she would have been better-cast as Mary Crawford.  Sylvestra Le Touzel in the 1983 BBC miniseries shall always be my ideal screen Fanny Price.

Blake Ritson is a fabulous Edmund and Hayley Atwell brings us a most beguiling, kittenish Mary Crawford.  The Bertrams are handled with great sensitivity, and I loved Douglas Hodge as Sir Thomas.  Jemma Redgrave, I'm happy to report, finally gave me a Lady Bertram that I could completely warm to, as opposed to the detached creature portrayed in previous versions.  Maggie O'Neill (TV's ""Shameless"") is delicious as the icy Aunt Norris.

Amongst other credits, screenwriter Maggie Wadey has previously written ""The Buccaneers"" in addition to the *admittedly problematic* 1986 BBC version of ""Northanger Abbey"", so she already has cache amongst the period drama set.  It's just a shame that she wasn't commissioned to write a longer miniseries version, as MANSFIELD PARK simply doesn't work as well in a conventional movie-length treatment.  Despite the shortcomings it remains enjoyable, though I suspect it will be more so for the casual viewers who don't know what is missing.",1333929600,2,3894,5.056338028169014
3272116,2,B000Z27HMW,"Did we really need another Mansfield Park remake?
Patricia Rozema's 1999 adaptation was a flat out dud, but at least there was some heart put into the project. And it does earn some points for casting.

The script for this version was nothing short of bland and uninspired.  It seemed to me as if the writer was given twenty four hours to capsulize the story and create a script because that's about all the heart that was poured into it.  It's like watching a really bad movie (any bad movie) and knowing the actors involved only did it for the paycheck.  But that isn't the only flaw here.

The casting! Most of the choices were fine; but Billie Piper?? Oi vey! Was the casting director smoking crack the day she read for the part?  She is the antithesis of Fanny: bleachy blonde hair complete with dark roots, jet black eyebrows and buck-toothed grill (I apologize for the harshness of my description, but it's pretty accurate).  Someone remarked she was far too modern looking and that's the absolute truth. The hair and make-up could have been dealt with (and it's a shame they weren't) but this actress needed better direction.  She acted all over the place; it was, at it's best, mentally agonizing to watch.

Not all were dreadful ... otherwise this would have gotten a single star.  But my recommendation is to skip the movies altogether -- read the book.

She seemed more suited for a different film - she was the only one to always wear her hear down and loose, lots of bosoms and parted lips. This version of the film only lightly treats the friendship between Mary Crawford and Fanny, as well as the relationship between Henry and Fanny. The older cousins all but disappear when the first marriage happens -- and it leaves out Fannie's visit to her family (instead she's ""left behind"" as punishment).

Now after watching it a third time, having watched the other two versions, it is my FAVORITE version.  Why?  Because in this one, the sweetness of Fanny's personality and the feeling between Fanny and Edmund are well conveyed.  These are two of the main points of the story, and are the elements that draw the viewer in and make us care.  Also, there is liveliness and energy in the movie -- this Fanny has health and spirit, which also adds to the enjoyment.

3272143,3,B000Z27HMW,"Definitely not what I expected. This is the second Mansfield Park I've bought (I have the version starring Frances O'Connor) and this one, while it definitely kept to the book more, did not seem to actively grasp the characters. In fact there seemed to be very little personality to anybody, except Mary Crawford, who was much more lascivious than merely misled and progressive in mindset. Henry Crawford was duly wicked, but no more than a blandly personified rake. Sir Thomas seemed always to speak as though in a rage, and in such a low, hissing tone I just stopped trying to hear his lines. Mrs. Norris was mostly disapproving, and mostly silent. Edmund was played well, as was (surprisingly) Lady Bertram, and William was well done as well. But worst of all was Fanny, who seemed to have no personality at all and at most displayed a repressed disappointment when Edmund professed his love for Miss Crawford. There are multiple scenes where she is running about playing tag or hide and seek, or chasing a dog - multiple enough to cause some eyebrow raising and thoughts of, ""Really?"" I suppose this is to further impress her carefree and cheerful spirit, but this is again not in keeping with the novel's Fanny Price.

Not unenjoyable, but a little unbelievable.",1310169600,,1267,4.8119266055045875
3272144,1,B000Z27HMW,"I understand that this movie was supposed to be an ""adaptation"" of Mansfield Park, but it would perhaps be more accurate to say that the names were borrowed from Austen's novel and transplanted into some rough crossover between Gossip Girl and Cruel Intentions. This so-called adaptation felt more like a fan-fiction written by someone with only a vague understanding of what Mansfield Park is really about.

To begin with, the Fanny Austen imagined was ""extremely timid and shy, shrinking from notice,"" yet here she is seen as a strong-willed girl who quite openly and coyly flirts with her cousin throughout the entire film, possesses contempt for most members of her neglectful family. There's even one seen where her cousin Edward walks into her room while she is washing her hair and quite undressed (for the time) and the two shyly smile at one another.

Lady Bertram seems to fill Mrs. Norris' role along with Mrs. Norris herself, making the derision of Fanny Price a bit over the top. Her uncle throughout the movie remains quite cold toward her, despite Austen suggesting he regarded her warmly, especially in light of the antics of his own children.

The film also begins roughly halfway through Austen's novel, with Maria already engaged to Mr. Rushmore. I understand the need to save time, and perhaps beginning there allowed the writers to more easily alter everything about the character of Fanny Price without more explanation.

Jane Austen should be rolling over in her grave.",1308268800,12,1492,5.004032258064516

3272146,3,B000Z27HMW,"Gah, what can I say about this adaptation. The good? Well...it was better than the Patricia Rozema version! And...a couple of the actors were well-cast. And...that's about it. Yup, it was a dud. Patricia Rozema made a terrible movie, but you could tell she cared about the movie she made. This one...it was as if their hearts weren't in it. The script was dull and the budget was almost nonexistent. Everything took place in the same couple of rooms or on the lawn at Mansfield Park. That means no Portsmouth and no Prices, other than Fanny and William, and no trip to Sotherton. And the casting and characterizations...most were decent (with a couple bizarre exceptions) but nothing amazing.

The bizarre casting choice for me was definitely Billie Piper. This is a horrible thing for me to say, but I thought she looked more like a prostitute than Fanny Price, with the cleavage, the bleach blond hair (but still black eyebrows!), and the buck tooth veneers. The screenwriter really didn't seem to know what to do with her character either. She had moments where she was quiet and shy and observant and others where she was running around laughing like Patricia Rozema's Fanny. They wanted to stay truer to the book character, I guess, but were still afraid to keep Fanny really as she was. Really, the only compliment I can give is that she and the actress who played young Fanny really looked alike.

I guess if you're really turned off by the old-school production values in the 1983 version or you can't find a copy, it would be better to watch this version than the 1999 one. That version was so horrible though that anything looks better in comparison.

Well, I wasn't exactly pleased with it since it seems to breeze through the story a little too quickly. On the other hand, the viewer does get the general feeling for what is going on. This is definitely not the most accurate version.

What I don't particularly like is that you don't get inside each of the principal characters as you do with the novel. In the film you see a little bit inside fanny and a little bit inside edmund and mary but thats about it.

I will say that this version is very watchable although I enjoyed the 1999 version a lot more (even though it is more fanciful and modern for its time). Having read the novel Mansfield Park several times i can safely say that the most accurate adaptation is the 1983 version, but it is also the most boring and most difficult version to watch (and none among the cast is particularly attractive).

I've seen at least two---and part of a third---and of those I've viewed from credits to credits this one, starting Billie Piper as Fannie, is quite good; I think that it certainly conveys the author's intentions.  The complexity of the novel, with its wheels within wheels, has been much pared down to suit a two hour production, but the central issue of the rot of overindulgence, vanity, and deceit and its effects on society is quite clear.  Less clear is the issue of slavery, the foundation of the Bertram family's wealth, which is only alluded to in passing when Mr. Bertram is forced to go to the West Indies to deal with urgent ""problems"" there that effect their financial situation. (England was beginning to question the morality of slavery, which it abolished in the 1830s, and Austen was composing the novel during the opening years of the century).

The Bertram family has done all the ""correct"" things dictated by society and on this yardstick has measured itself  ""successful.""  Smug in its sense of its own worth, the family invites a young relative, eight year old Fanny the daughter of the ""unfortunate"" sister of Mrs. Bertram, to live with them and enjoy the benefits of her connection.  Essentially they need an appreciative audience whose duty is to be ""grateful"" and humbled by the Bertram family's status.  (In other versions, the sycophantic Aunt Norris shows us how it's done).  Her presence in the family is to be a constant reminder of how perfect their lives are compared to those of others.  Instead the little girl misses her own family and is intimidated rather than awed by the excesses she sees around her.  The limits that Mr. Bertram places on his generosity to his niece because she is not quite ""acceptable"" actually allow Fanny to grow up normal in the midst of the dysfunction of his own family.  When the fruits of his arrogant sense of identity become apparent by the ruination of his eldest daughter's reputation and the near death of his eldest son and heir through drink, Bertram finally admits that it is only the sensible Fanny upon whom he can depend.

The stifling boredom arising from a life lived in affluence but without purpose is made abundantly clear by Mrs. Bertram and her children.  The lady shows utter devotion to her pug dogs whose litters she is apparently allowed to raise herself, and she has a propensity for falling asleep anytime there is a family gathering.  She lies languidly on her couch, doing little or nothing, day in and day out, while her children are raised by and her home managed by others.  Her eldest son is so overwhelmed by boredom and purposelessness that he gambles and drinks himself nearly to death, while her youngest finds it difficult to make decisions without first consulting Fanny and even begins to question his choice of professions because his infatuation over his neighbor has brought this choice into conflict with her ambitions.  Mrs. Bertram's eldest daughter is so used to getting her way in everything, that she sees no reason why she shouldn't have a rich husband and an exciting and handsome lover.  And her youngest daughter simply disappears into London ""society.""  This is the ""perfect life"" only if you are Voltaire's Dr. Pangloss,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Candide/dp/1450576931/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Candide</a>.

The WGBH Boston production of Mansfield Park is played straight; that is to say, it's entirely serious and straight forward.  Little by way of levity occurs.  This is the ""Henrick Ibsen"" version of the story, so to speak.  There is another, more George Bernard Shaw, version where some of the characters, particularly Aunt Norris and Aunt Bertram, are played as more comedic and where the family's complete dependence on Fanny borders on obsession.  Although I enjoyed it very much when I saw it on TV, I'm not certain it really conveyed the author's intentions nearly as well as this one does.

Costumes---a strong presence in many of the WGHB Boston/BBC productions---are not quite as stunning in this instance, though they're probably more realistic for the times.  One of the wedding gowns is quite lovely--though I hated the hat--but otherwise the costumes designed for this version are less impressive.  The scenery too is somewhat lacking, which is amazing given that even a series like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midsomer-Murders-Set-16/dp/B002MUAXJ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midsomer Murders: Set 16</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Agatha-Christie-s-Poirot-The-Definitive-Collection/dp/B001AOC9G8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Agatha Christie's Poirot: The Definitive Collection</a>&nbsp;is able to convey an intensity of natural verdure that is positively breath taking.  Admitting that some of the dialogue indicates the appreciation of the natural vistas of Mansfield Park--as opposed to the often overdone formal gardens of such estates--one might still expect more of a sense of from whence this appreciation arises. Even fields in England can be glorious works of ""art,"" but those viewed from Mansfield Park are just boring--like the people perhaps?

This Masterpiece Theatre version of Jane Austen's novel was really disappointing.  The biggest problem was the casting of Billie Piper as Fanny.  Her always-disheveled, bottle blonde hair and inexplicably black eyebrows weren't true to the period and she acted too modern and low class; none of her dialogue was believable because she looked so wrong for the part.  She would have been better as a naughty chambermaid than someone brought up in an aristocrat's home.  Another victim of inaccurate hair and make-up was Hayley Atwell (Mary Crawford) who had a 2007 hair style and sculpted eyebrows which were lovely, but completely wrong for the time.  Her casual speech and flirtatious actions would have had no place in formal Regency society.

The actors playing Fanny's aunt and uncle were too young and lacked a lord and lady's proper breeding.

If you assigned M.P. to a freshman English class and asked them to write a 3-5 page paper on the plot, this is the movie you would get based on their summaries. It's choppy. Scene shifts are sudden. There is no subtlety, whether in acting, stagecraft, or filming. They give you one blunt, bludgeoned sentence to give you the fullest character of each person and fail miserably to develop anyone any further. With such a view of it, you can imagine the snarky comments I might add when I discovered that Jane Austen was not even credited in the film for having written the novel - Maggie Wadey gets that honor.

Most of the main scenes are there, but in such a choppy fashion that it's a wonder anyone who hadn't read it could follow it. Fanny gives you a brief introductory narration, and from then until halfway through the movie she does not speak - she just looks a little severely at everyone. She spends most of her time pouting. Edmund, when he realizes who he loves, is feverish and frightening and does a terrible job emoting love and affection. He spends most of his time looking like he needs to run off to the lavatory, but has to look dignified until the director yells Cut. They almost completely removed Aunt Norris and one of the sisters from the movie (and how do you understand what Fanny has gone through without Aunt Norris??).

They also almost completely cut Mr. Crawford's romancing of Fanny. He says he intends to pursue and she says he lacks constancy. He then meets her in the garden and says he has proved his constancy! Did I blink and miss it?? The next scene is when they learn a plot spoiler. She doesn't even go home to her own family! Mary Crawford was done halfway decently but, lacking Ms. Austen's subtlety, her lifting of her skirt to show her ankle, her blatant come-hither glares, and her demanding air make her much more of a tyrannical temptress than a decided clergyman-to-be would consider. The one humorous note is that the oldest brother, Tom, is played by a Mr. (James) D'Arcy.

I could go on, but won't.

For die hard Austen fans, it definitely does not follow the novel, but at least there isn't sexual pictures, lesbian insinuations, or illicit material in it as was evidenced in the 1999 production.
  In this version, the director must have been interested in portraying a greater dichotomy between Fanny's class and her upper class cousins than in keeping with period fashion.
  For instance, Fanny looks like a wild, modern young woman in this version with her relatively-short-hair always down instead of kept up like the ladies of the time. If they were going to leave her hair down to prove a point of her difference and disregard for the proper style of the day, then they should have at least had her hair be the proper length that it would have been in those days. Thomas Bertram had hair practically the same length that Fanny had, and he is a man.
  Also, in this version, there is a considerable amount left out concerning the Price family and the activities within the Bertram household, as well as many of the character details of the Crawfords... which the 1999 version is better at including.
  There also is an awkward mention of the slavery that Sir Bertram is involved in that seems more thrown in as a ditch effort to one-line the abolitionist thought of the time. Yet, I still prefer it to the vulgar drawings of explicit nature in the 1999 version.

I'd like to issue a challenge to a filmaker out there somewhere to make a really good quality Mansfield Park, that has good casting, acting, directing, filming, music, AND costuming, as has been presented in A&E's Pride and Prejudice, the Gwyneth Paltrow version of Emma, both the BBC and Emma Thompson versions of Sense and Sensibility, etc.",1247097600,3,779,4.7407407407407405
3272202,3,B000Z27HMW,"I wanted to root for this version, I really did. Fanny Price is one of most unappreciated of the Austen lead females. I am always up for an Austen adaption, but this one, well, I was disappointing. The only reason I will be buying it because my Austen DVD collection feels incomplete without it.

Billie Piper was an interesting choice of Fanny Price. However, it would have been a better choice had she looked appropriate for the period, as others have pointed out. I liked Blake Ritson as Edmund and Hayley Atwell was an excellent Mary. The moment I knew I was disappointing when Fanny was not send back to Portsmith after rejecting Henry. Though it was nice to see William.

Oh well, maybe one day, we will get a faithful adaption.",1241740800,2,734,4.553030303030303
3272203,1,B000Z27HMW,"In any film adaptation of a novel liberties must be taken, but in this case critical points in the story were removed as misleading touches were added.  First and foremost, we have to see the profound but infinitely gradual transformation of Fanny Price.  This is the Cinderella story as it might be in reality.  Fanny is described as remarkably pretty, but it does not show until she is forced into the spotlight.  Her strength of character has been formed by years of abuse and neglect bolstered by probably an excellent education as she was left without other amusements.
In this film, the Fanny has far too much confidence and a kind of wildness that is wholly at odds with her description. The novel makes it clear that she has an innate elegance that is nowhere to be seen in this film.

The characters in Mansfield Park may be Austen's most realistic.  There is more than a hint that Sir Thomas is involved in the slave trade.  The sisters, Maria and Julia seem like clones, but you can read the subtle but telling differences; illustrating these would make the film so much more interesting.  Mrs. Norris is a true villain who tortures Fanny for years.  Henry Crawford can be seen as a tragic figure who is nearly saved by his association with Fanny; the scenes in Portsmouth open us to his potential.  Edmund is kind of stiff, and marriage to Mary might have helped him.  The novel makes clear that Tom does not return to the racing pages after his brush with death. Even the character of Susan offers a glimpse into what a strong character in reduced circumstances can achieve.

I did promise to be brief, but like so many other contributions here, mine is in danger of listing the many faults of this film.  Do yourself a favour and read the book!",1241222400,7,1758,4.578274760383387

I wasn't convinced that each one WAS the character they were playing.  Billie Piper is a lovely girl, but she just isn't Jane Austen type.  Her portrayal of Fannie was just...weird.  Fanny wasn't the kind of lady you'd expect to see in Jane Austen's time, that's for sure.  Even the romance elements of the film were downplayed and rushed.  If you're looking for a good period romance, watch ""North and South"" with Richard Armitage.  If you want a good Jane Austen film, watch ""Pride and Prejudice"" with Colin Firth, ""Sense and Sensibility"" (either one, but the BBC is more accurate), or ""Northanger Abbey"" by BBC.

Needless to say I was absolutely shocked to see how Fanny's character had changed.  For those who say the writers didn't read the book...they did.  I watched a behind the scenes of the entire project and what the director and writer had to say about Fanny was that she was really boring in the book.  One of them said something about the character that got bleeped out.  Here's what they missed Fanny may be scared of her own shadow, but she is the moral compass of the group. Personally I think while it was a rather ambitious project to have all five new adaptations out last year...I would have rather waited and have Andrew Davis be the one doing the screenplay for all of them.

The film does not dwell on Fanny's youth, but moves you directly into her conflict of watching her love interest, Edmund Bertram, fall prey to the charms of a flirtatious, materialistic new neighbor.

Actress Billie Piper does a wonderful job as the grounded, dependable Fanny who stays true to her heart despite the pressures around her to accept another suitor.

There are times I felt the acting was a bit contemporary in terms of gestures, emotion and expressions.  One might see that as a conscious choice on the part of the director, however--a way to make these works appealing to contemporary audiences.  I'm not certain was what being attempted.

I first watched the 1999 version, it having better reviews, and I liked it quite a bit (aside from thinking ""Where is William?""). But, still curious, I came back to this version, having always liked the adaptions this group put out, and was astounded that it could recieve such bad reviews. I loved it. Some things are missing, if you are considering the book to be the supposed script. But, I thought it flowed very well even with those pieces missing.

She dyed her hair blonde for the movie but unfortunately she has a deep undergrowth coming through. Umm, not sure if she knew that girls didn't really dye their hair in that era and that I am sure she would've been able to afford it even if they did. Without watching her hair roots everytime she was on camera, she and the rest of the cast gave off such a poor performance that you didn't care what happened.

I do not recall when Wilberforce started his anti-slavery movement in England, but if Austen didn't make a reference to it in her book, is it likely that Fanny would have questioned Sir Thomas's slave-owning tendencies? Both this movie and the '99 version did it, this one thankfully MUCH less. Yes, we all know NOW that slavery is wrong, evil, etc., but back then it was a way of life, and I seriously doubt that meek little Fanny Price would have said anything about it.",1219622400,3,694,4.650406504065041
3272218,1,B000Z27HMW,"I like Billie Piper's acting, I do.  Her turn in ""Shakespeare Retold: Much Ado About Nothing"" was excellent, and though I haven't seen all her episodes, I found Piper's Rose very good as well.  She more than held up her own against veterans like David Tennant and especially Christopher Eccleston.

""Mansfield Park"", though, was very bad.  Very...not good.

Fanny is supposed to be a mousy, sickly creature; it's why Edmund gives her a horse to ride for exercise every day.  When she misses a few days, she gets sick.  Why is Fanny running about and chasing people around the house?  I can't tell if this is poor script or poor acting or both.  This is not Fanny Price.

Most people have picked up on the major plot alteration as well, with Fanny not being forced to leave Mansfield Park despite her rejection of Crawford.  It's a major plot and character point - Fanny getting kicked around and basically living at the whim of the Bertrams.  Also, her rejection of Crawford is a major, major problem, and her being sent away is evidence of that.

To be honest, I can't remember much more; it was kind of painful to watch.  Not any better than the 1999 Frances O'Connor ""Mansfield Park"", though I personally wouldn't say it was worse.  (1999's Fanny the budding writer?!)  Austen sighs in her grave and hopes Andrew Davies will write the next ""Mansfield Park"" adaptation.

What was good?  Blake Ritson turned in a fairly good Edmund, and Hayley Atwell turned in a fantastic Mary Crawford, with all her complexity - her kindness towards Fanny, her protectiveness towards Fanny, and her moral laxness.  I'm biased towards Jemma Redgrave.  I was also amused that the Bionic Woman played Maria Bertram and that young Fanny (Julia Joyce) had played the younger version of Billie Piper's characters twice before.

It might look stagy, but I found the 1980s BBC ""Mansfield Park"" truer to the book than either of the new versions.  Nicholas Farrell and Sylvestra Le Touzel in their first cooperative outing were good.  A young Farrell gives his Edmund real life (especially given how productions looked then), and Le Touzel, while she does have the wide-eyed spaciness of some of the 80s adaptations, presents the most Austen-ish Fanny I've seen yet.",1218758400,10,2242,4.826771653543307

There was no substance to this story adn it did not feel like anything related to Jane Austin. It was some airy fairy version of something. Billy Piper was so wrong for this period character with her blonde layered 70's hairdo and thick dark brown eyebrows and she did not have the mannerisms of a lady of this time like Jennifer Ehle had in Pride and Predjudice. Billy Piper was so miscast and was the worst miscast and the rest of the actors too in my opinion. It was just plain boring to me. Miss Crowleys hair too was like something I wore at my first holy communion when I was 7 I think back in the 60's. It was nothing like the hairstyle from that era with her wispy pieces from her ears and the fancy pulled back bun which was way too modern. I found the female actors just did not have the mannersims of this time period and did not act them well at all as ladys of regency of 19th century england. Blake Ritson was the best cast in this. He just ""had it"" and was convincing of this period. Before I knew it, the movie was over and I thought what was this all about where is the story here. Too Short of a movie.......................If Toby stephens, Colin Firth, Ruth Wilson and Jennifer Ehle had been cast this would have been superb as long as they had the correct team players as well. The cover of the DVD was strange as I found Billy Pipers hair and dress somewhat of a different time too again she looked like someone I would see today with bleach blonde hair layered with a 2008 top.

1. Most of the characters in the movie don't resemble the characters in the book.  Did the director ever read Mansfield Park?
2.  The story line has been completely changed.  For instance, after refusing Mr. Crawford, Fannie doesn't go to visit her family.  This is a major part of the story.  Why on earth would they right this out of the plot?

Before I saw this one, the strongest objections that I had were a few significant deviations from Austen's intentions and a few versions that were just plain boring.

When I saw this version of Mansfield Park, I was so distracted by Billie Piper's appearance that I could not suspend disbelief and enjoy the story.  Her hair color does not occur naturally, now or in any century.  The ensuing contrast with her dark eye brows was jarring every time she was on screen.  I didn't get used to it for the entire movie.

If they were trying to create Fanny Price, why did they go for the Madonna (""Like a Virgin"") look?

Different actress?  Different hair color?  Lighten the eye brows?  All seem like good alternatives.

After some consideration, I've decided this one wins the prize.  The basic story is that a humble, meek poor relation comes to live with a grand family, an act of charity they intend will ""improve"" her.  In the end, she improves them.  Fanny is the one with steadfast moral character and the strength around which the family gathers in time of crisis.  This version ended up as a kind of Harlequin romance in historic costume, with Fanny alternating between child-like romping and sexy, smoldering looks of burning passion.  When will movie makers get it that there is something going on in Austen's work besides a romance?

The only successful adaptation I've seen is the Sylvestra Le Touzel version  from twenty-odd years ago.  It is sadly dated now and looks like a stage play on film, so it could stand to be updated.  I'm sadly beginning to think this will never be done well.",1209340800,15,995,4.766081871345029

Let me just say that the actors were the worst and the movie was cheap. The fashion was not right and Fanny's mouth and hair killed me.
At first, I thought it was pretty good, but then it became almost a comedy. Fanny is forward and does not have as strong of a will and good morals as she does in the book. The three things that really bothered me were:

1- In the book and the older version of the movie the love between Mr. and Mrs. Bertram is so beautiful and very sweet, whereas in the new film they hardly communicate.

2- What happened to the sea, Betsy, Susan, Fanny's family, and the visits from Henry Crawford?

3- It lacked the build up and suspense of Fanny's fate with Henry. That was a big frustration.

She is sooooo humble and good that I had trouble believing that certain rakish characters in the book could ever fall in love with her.  That said, this new movie adaptation chops a large book into a mere 90 minutes.  Characters, locations, and key passages have been completely removed.  Mansfield Park wasn't merely condensed - it was crushed.  As some earlier reviewers have said, the best way to watch it is to forget the original book and pretend that it's a brand new story.",1206576000,3,659,4.7368421052631575
3272236,3,B000Z27HMW,"The 1986 BBC adaptation of Mansfield Park remains in my opinion the most faithful adaptation of Jane Austen's work. Starring Sylvestra Le Touzel as Fanny Price and Nicholas Farrell as Edmund Bertram, the two leads were a bit tepid in their performances, yet the script was quite faithful, perhaps too much so. Then we had the 1999 movie version of Mansfield Park starring Frances O'Connor as Fanny Price. Though she acted very well with the given script, the version was so far removed from Austen's work as to render it alien, and could only be appreciated if viewed as a story by itself, without drawing comparisons with Austen's work [for one, O'Connor's Fanny was way too spirited and audacious].

And now we come to the 2007 adaptation of Mansfield Park, starring Billie Piper [of ""Doctor Who""] as Fanny Price, who at the age of ten is sent by her impoverished mother to live with her wealthy sister, Lady Bertram [Jemma Redgrave] and her family comprising husband, Lord Bertram, daughters Mariah and Julia, and sons Tom [James D'arcy] and Edmund [Blake Ritson]. Young Fanny knows her place and grows up loving her cousin Edmund [yes, it was apparently acceptable back in Austen's time]. Enter the scheming Mary Crawford [Hayley Atwell] ,and her brother Henry [Joseph Beattie] who worm themselves into Mansfield Park and cause much havoc within the family - Henry flirting with Mariah, and Mary setting her cap at Edmund, much to Fanny's chagrin. What follows is Fanny's journey through heartache, awakening, and finally happiness.

The acting in this version was not all that commendable - Billie Piper's Fanny with her striking blond locks and contrasting dark eyebrows is a far cry from Austen's portrayal of the demure and sickly Fanny Price in the novel. The rest of the cast too are quite lukewarm in their performances. Blake Ritson's Edmund, though very good-looking was very shallow and unconvincing,especially in his ardor for Ms Crawford. It is only in the later part that he seems to portray some semblance of sincerity in his newly discovered love for Fanny. Hayley Atwell's Mary Crawford does carry a semblance of credibility in her role and even manages to upstage Fanny Price at times.

This version takes too many liberties with Austen's work - the characters here are not faithful to the ones portrayed in the book, even the minor characters like Lady Bertram who was sickly in the novel,seems enthused with enough energy to pass energetic comments in this version. Many important scenes are cut out as are characters, and there is not much character development at all. It all appears like a rush job with disastrous consequences for the storyline.

The sets and cinematography though are beautifully done and the scenes of the countryside are particularly enchanting. On the whole, I can't say I love this latest adaptation of Mansfield Park [which seems to be the only one of Austen's works to fare so poorly in its screen adaptations], yet it is watchable, and makes for light entertainment.",1206403200,4,3018,4.97029702970297

3272238,4,B000Z27HMW,"The first time I watched this dvd I had just finished rereading Mansfield Park and I was very disappointed in the production. The first couple of minutes take you well into the book with almost dizzying speed. I have never been a big fan of Fanny and she ties Emma as one of my  least favorite Jane Austen characters as she is a sickly, righteous young lady whose sole distinction is her goodness.  After allowing some time to pass between the rereading and then re-watching I was surprised at how much I enjoyed the Mansfield Park, such as it is, which is to say, in many ways, it is not.  Lady Bertram, as portrayed by Jane Austen, can barely summon the strength to breathe, let alone share an insightful thought, but in this MS she is perceptive.  Mrs. Norris, her sister, is robbed of all her malevolent, insipid and ultimately destructive  nature and is quite passive. Her behavior in the book results in grave character flaws in  Maria and Julia.  Fanny as portrayed by Billie Piper is an enjoyable character,and, unlike the Fanny in the book one can understand why Mr. Crawford and Edmund fall in love with her.

3272240,3,B000Z27HMW,I have no idea why Masterpiece on PBS is giving us these truncated versions of Jane Austen's novels. There is no reason trying to adapt Austen's novel into a 90 minute movie. Too much is left out and there are hardly any psychological nuances touched upon among the characters. The cast of this version is very appealing but there is no enough dramatic buildup or tension. We will have to wait another few years for a definitive film version of Mansfield Park. Supposedly the best adaptation in this series is the new Sense and Sensibility and that is in two parts.,1204761600,,565,4.603960396039604

3272243,2,B000Z27HMW,"What is it with actresses who dye their hair blond and leave their brows dark -- it's horribly distracting.

If you want a good adaptation of Mansfield Park, go to the previous BBC version.  It's a bit slow, (but so is the book) but very faithful to the spirit of the novel. This film, whatever it is, is not Mansfield Park, nor is the actress in any way Fanny. Fanny was reserved, shy, and not strong. The girl in this movie had her breasts and hair continually flopping about and her face (under her two tone hair) bore a perpetually sulky smirk that seemed to be trying for sultriness.  Her wild behavior (and appearance) bears no resemblance to the character in the book. The rest of the film wasn't too bad, but with the central character so out of character, it was hard to enjoy anything else.

Whoever did this adaption appears to have been influenced by the ""Beverly Hillbillies"" version of Pride and Prejudice that had equally bizarre behavior on the part of the main characters.  Suffice to say, Fanny wouldn't be running around as the character in this film does.  The new adaptations of Persuation and Northanger Abbey are fine, but this one is a failure.",1204502400,5,1168,4.591346153846154

It did grow on me, perhaps not as a depiction of Jane Austen's ""Mansfield Park"" and her characters, but as an enjoyable love story.

3272246,2,B000Z27HMW,"I have to agree with the other reviewers that question what were they thinking not putting up Fanny's hair! I realize to some this might be a minor point but one the most important themes in Mansfield Park is Fanny transition from Girl to Woman. We don't get to see this transformation of Fanny on film; she never puts her hair up and becomes a young lady. It is the other character's realization that Fanny is no longer a child that causes the plot to twist. Why does Mr. Crawford fall in love with Fanny in this version? Why does Edmond have a change of heart? Fanny's hair is a visual symbol of her maturing. On a side note it would have made the scene where Edmund walks in while she is washing her hair at the end more powerful. As he is seeing her as only a husband would see his wife- hair down.

Jane Austen did not write screen plays and most viewers are savvy enough to realize that a 90 minute production can not include all the sub-plots; scene changes that we find in the book. All can be forgiven if the main characters stay true to the original in spirit. This script did not capture the spirit of Fanny from the book. She was not there to glue everything together, which made the scenes seem choppy, stuck together and fans left to wonder if they had never read the book would they have understood what happened.

To end on a high note:
The casting was excellent. The actor did a terrific job with what they were given. I probably would have highly enjoyed this production, if I didn't think I was watching an adaptation of Mansfield Park.",1204416000,6,1555,4.34020618556701

I do agree with one reviewer that Fanny probably would not have run around as wildly as she did, with hair unbound...and there was one sequence in which a gentleman addresses Fanny and she ignores him while she plays hide and seek with a child which i thought was very improper for that time period.

The main themes are very much central to this film version.  Adapting a complex book for a movie is not an easy task.  Scenes and interactions are bound to be lost in a literalistic manner.

The huge turning point for Fannie Price is when she is returned to her parents after refusing Henry Crawford so that she might be reminded of the comfortable life she has grown accustomed to at Mansfield Park.  And yet in this film, they never even leave MP! We never see Maria in any opulence that the Rushforth fortune would have brought to her -- that would have clearly shown what she forfeited for the rake, Crawford.  And Fanny's hair is always down and messy, not very realistic for a period piece.  Lady Bertram has been relegated to background as is the condescending, manipulative Mrs. Norris that everyone loves to hate!  The scene with Edmund and Miss Crawford when she tells him of her strategy for over-coming the tragedy and scandal of their siblings' affair, was lacking in dramatic tension.  As was the entire film.  The 1999 version, is so much more enjoyable!  (Although I now own this DVD, I doubt it will be watched again.

It had to of been hand held, it jumped all over, why on earth didn't they use a steadycam? It made the film look bad! When it was steady, the shots were done so awkwardly; the angles were wrong and close ups were used when it would have been better to have a wider angle.

I was therefore pretty disappointed when I watched ""Mansfield Park"" master piece theater the first time...Here a short list of the major aspects (there is unfortunately more) that made me dislike this version;

The actress cast as Fanny Price (Billie Piper) while is not bad expressing Fanny's demure personality, she seems physically all wrong.  Her hair, looks stringy, color is really brassy (VERY FAKE LOOKING) and as other readers have mentioned not historically correct!  Why is it always down?  And for the most part looks like it hasn't been brushed!  Also the dark eyebrows and hint of mascara were really distracting!  She shows a bit too much cleavage for Fanny which might be plausible ONLY for her ""special picnic""

The character of Henry Crawford is really unlikable, there is not one moment in the film where you wonder, is he misjudged? Is he really a changed man?  That is one of the most entertaining parts of the story, is just when you start to believe that Henry Crawford might be a changed man, you discovered that you are being fooled!  This was missing in the movie, maybe because they have not devoted to much time showing Crawford trying to win Fanny's affection..  The older version staring Frances O Connor developed the relationship between Fanny & Crawford thoroughly.

You don't get to see just how poor Fanny's parents are in comparison to the Bertram's (it is mentioned only), thus it is more difficult to establish why Fanny feels like such an outsider at Mansfield Park.

Mrs. Norris is not as comical as she is in the book nor the other older movie version of Mansfield Park...

There was one thing that I did enjoy in this Mansfield Park, which the version staring Frances O Connor was missing....The close relationship of Fanny's and her brother William, as this character is totally missing from the older movie version.

I give it 2 stars for the nice costumes, set decorations and beautiful location.",1202169600,7,2122,4.823204419889502
3272258,5,B000Z27HMW,"Though I dearly love Austen's  Mansfield Park and could agree that much of what she wrote is missing in this adaptation, I nevertheless can appreciate that what we are given is still a delightful costume drama. Strip Austen of layers, if you must, but her genius is so forgiving that a worthwhile (i.e., passionate) story still exists. Couple that with the dexterous acting of Blake Ritson, Billie Piper and cast, and you have an enjoyable movie that brings the past to life in vivid colour.  The beginning is a bit awkwardly done, and if you stand on the letter of the law, so to speak, you will find fault (as many have, see more reviews) but if you can view the film for what it does offer, there is much to be enjoyed. (Other than Piper's hair; pretty, but shockingly improper for a regency miss!) And Hayley Atwell does a tantalizing Mary Crawford though her forwardness in the film would have forewarned the devout Edmund long before the scriptwriters allowed him to catch on to her true nature here. Her facial mannerisms are so well-done that she comes across rather likeable, despite her faults. Poor Fannie is good, to be sure, but more child-like than Austen intended, and her good choices seem to come more from a strong childish passion rather than sense or strong wits. Nevertheless, you will be drawn in and swept along to a strong ending that is great fun. (And I do love fun--or I wouldn't be a regency romance author.)",1201996800,10,1436,4.627450980392157
3272259,1,B000Z27HMW,"The beauty of Mansfield Park the novel is that Fanny is the perfect narrator - discounted by all as a 'no body', she is perfectly situated to observe and report all the events occuring around her.

A movie based on someone who is a 'no body', who nothing really happens to other than some mild bullying and a lame attempt at a seduction will never work. It's my opinion that Mansfield Park as a film would only work if the character of Fanny is either ""sexed up"", melded with attributes of other Austen characters, or dispensed of entirely. Which of course, would not please Austen fans.

So, please do not waste your time or money by purchasing this film - you would be better off by reading the actual novel, and then watching ""Pride and Prejudice"" or Emma Thompson's ""Sense and Sensibility"".

3272263,1,B000Z27HMW,"As an Austen scholar, I was bracing myself for something that would take liberties with the novel, but it seems that the screenwriter must surely have read only the Cliff notes. Even then, the early part's first-person narrative made me wonder if s/he had picked up her abbreviated version of Jane Eyre instead. An estate called Mansfield Park is indeed involved, but that's about as close it gets.

Even such a massive rewrite might have been tolerable with some accurate historical research, but there are SO many funny mistakes in the representation of both the characters and the period that it was hard to believe this production could appear on (the program once known as) Masterpiece Theatre.

One could hardly determine which was longer and bounced more--Fanny's full and unbound hair or her full and nearly unbound cleavage, as the charity-case companion races shrieking and laughing through the estate. Nor should you look for the novel's complacent, drowsy, plump Lady Bertram (for whom so many have a secret affection); the beautiful but miscast Jemma Redgrave presents an elegant, intelligent mother with sharp insight.

But there's worse. When Henry Crawford drags Maria behind the curtain and declares himself her lover as they grope and grab, I nearly gagged; and when Edmund sits next to a sprawling Fanny after the picnic (no ball) and tells her how lovely she looks, I did gag. Plus, Fanny's absolutely central visit to Portsmith is axed. I don't mind streamlining when the end product is smooth and historically and literarily accurate, but this production was jumpy and jumbled.

When the whole thing finally closes with a WALTZ in 1810, it was I who was shrieking with laughter--eveyone knows that dance did not come out until 20 years later and THEN was considered very racy; certainly not something a reserved clergyman from the upper classes would have initiated at his rural Tory wedding. Good lord, who wrote this mess anyway, Barbara Cartland?

Which is a real shame, because the marvelous actors and actresses (except for the lovely Miss Redgrave) looked right for their parts--and I'm sure we'll see them again in hopefully better material. But let's face it, folks; modern screenwriters are just too terrified of frail, gentle Fanny to bring her to us as Austen created her.",1201564800,120,2305,5.039370078740157
3272264,1,B000Z27HMW,"As an ardent Jane Austen fan, I shuddered with horror at this production. It  bore little resemblance to the book. I can't begin to write about how wrong everything was, so I'll keep my comments to a few of the main characters.

Instead of a shy, retiring, timid, somewhat delicate Fanny Price we get a robust serving wench of a girl - all bosoms and teeth with wildchild hair. The difference between Jane Austen's Fanny and her cousins is intended to compare a poor girl with uncompromising moral principles to a group of worldly, indolent young people who pursue pleasure unencumbered by such principles. (Even the steady, religious-minded Edmund goes off course; Fanny - never.)

In this production, I saw a healthy, active girl who bounces about. She takes part in the play staged by the Bertram children and their friends the Crawfords and runs shrieking and grabbing people at a picnic. The Fanny in the book refuses to take part in the play, even when asked by her beloved cousin because it's against her morals. Somehow I can't imagine Ms. Austen intended her to be the life of the party at a picnic. Thus a most important theme in the book is lost.

Aunt Bertram seemed to become a somewhat shrewd character instead of the woman who would plaintively ask others what she should think and who would placidly agree with stronger personalities. Lady Bertram is supposed to an example of egoistic indolence and sloth. In her, Jane Austen creates a satirical stereotype of manners and customs.

Aunt Norris, that selfish busybody who's persecution of Fanny and blind adoration of Maria underscores her foolishness fades in importance. She should be characterized by meanness, officiousness and sycophancy towards the powerful, and bullying of anyone she perceives to be in her power - such as Fanny. She was a key character in Jane Austen's story.

I won't go into all the scenes left out or changed in this production. And the very important themes lost - does Sir Thomas' business in the West Indies involve the slave trade? (Or the unique, rather bizarre ones added to it.) I guess this adaptation was an attempt to ""modernize"" the story by introducing an inordinate amount of sexual tension and removing the wit and sting of Jane Austen's writing.

If you are a serious Jane Austen fan, don't watch this. It's truly awful, a powerful example of how wrong things can go when you take a classic and remove its soul.",1201564800,52,2421,4.7913669064748206
3272265,1,B000Z27HMW,"I had high hope for this series and particularly this installment as I so love the book.  Thusfar each of the first three episodes suffer from the impossibility of condensing a rich period novel into 90 minutes.  There is no real chemistry between Edmund and Fanny--- and since there is so little time for any real character development that is crucial to making this piece work.

The concept behind the series--- creating collection of Jane Austen films-- was wonderful. But why not full blown, authentic, quality productions instead of 90 minute tv movies?",1201478400,9,558,4.978494623655914
3272266,2,B000Z27HMW,"There has yet to be a successful adaptation of Mansfield Park. I was hoping PBS, of all people, would produce something akin to tolerable for Austen fans, but this is yet another disappointment. I agree with the other reviewers that the first half was very choppy. I think the adapters were trying to rush through elements of the story that they feel are problematic - primarily the play business, which is even confusing in the novel if you're unaware of social context.

But why can't anyone do justice to poor Fanny Price? Even many fans dislike her as a character but she is one of my favorites. I find this version's Fanny very strange, she spends most of her time chasing small children and dogs, much to the puzzlement of all and seems to have some hair styling issues. Jane's Fanny is a waif who never moves faster than a slow crawl, unless atop a horse and then I'm sure never faster than a trot. She's described as unattractive and forgettable, a perpetual martyr, and definitely something less than a true part of the Bertram family. She's painfully shy and terrified of Mr. Betram, though she does love him as a father.

And lastly, I find the portrayal of Mrs. Bertram utterly laughable! To imply that she's so observant and attached so dearly to Fanny is ridiculous. The novel's Mrs. Betram is a dreadfully lazy moron who spends all her time getting Fanny to do her needlework for her (especially the difficult bits) and sleeping. She treats Fanny as a servant and gives her a cold unheated bedroom to live in. She evens tries to pawn her off on Aunt Norris (though Norris treats Fanny even worse than the Betrams and luckily Fanny's spared this fate).

The simple truth is that most film adapters are afraid the public won't like Fanny Price and maybe they're right. Everyone always says Jane Austen endures because her characters are relatable, even a hundred years later, but maybe Mansfield Park can't make the transition. Unfortunately, most filmmakers have been too afraid to even try.",1201478400,16,2005,4.722857142857142
3272267,2,B000Z27HMW,"To be honest I haven't cared for any of the adaptations that I've seen of Mansfield Park.  This one stands alone in sheer awfulness though.  Billie Piper was a bad miscast, and while the acting in general was good, the screenplay badly lets Jane and the viewer down with some very stupid alterations to the story.  To save time, a lot of the action takes place off screen and then the characters discuss it.  The characters were altered, some beyond recognition.  The Aunt Norris character was the most egregious example of this.  Instead of being a greedy, selfish, ill-natured, hateful bitch, she's comes off as more bored than boorish, and seems more lazy and vague than Aunt Bertram, who actually seems to have an attention span and some saving graces in this adaptation.  Nothing ever seems to be explained, and if viewers were not familiar with the original novel, they would be totally confused with this mess.  The costumes seemed off, for the women, although the men's were generally good.  I so wanted to like this one, because I tossed out the one with Ms Le TOuzel, which I found meandering and coma-inducing. I also found her performance screechy and juvenile.  The Frances O'Connor version was my least favorite until this one.  Not any more!  That one actually looks almost acceptable compared to this steaming, craptacular pile of inept mediocrity.  If you haven't seen this yet, don't bother.  You won't have missed anything but a good case of irritation.  I found Ms. Piper underwhelming at best, and as another reviewer noted, her blonde hair and black brows were discordant, as was her unbound, messy hair.  She looked more like a  blowsy serving wench than the cousin and niece of a great family.  Mansfield Park was never my favorite Austen, and with adaptations like this, it won't change any time soon.

She is invited to live with the family at Mansfield Park, but is treated as something of a glorified servant and expected to be grateful.  Her one friend in the household is her kindly cousin Edmund (Blake Ritson).

As the story gets properly underway, the rhythm of life at Mansfield Park is upset by two events, the departure of patriarch Sir Thomas to tend to family properties in Antigua, and the arrival of Henry and Mary Crawford.  Henry and Mary are presented as worldly schemers who plan to marry the most eligible of the Bertram clan and claim a share of the family fortune.  The absence of Sir Thomas allows them to gain undue influence over the young adults in the household.  Henry pursues the already engaged eldest daughter, while Mary flashes her considerable charm at Edmund.

Fanny suffers in silence as her Edmund is distracted by Mary.  Her life is further complicated when the untrustworthy Henry makes a surprise marriage proposal, and Fanny is placed under great pressure by the returned Sir Thomas to accept.  Fanny's dilemma sets up a rather dramatic ending...

This shortened version of the original story results in a choppy delivery and a loss of the some of the subtlety of the plot.  Most of the minor characters get minimal screen time.  The ending is not bad, but it doesn't really project the moral challenge presented to Fanny, or her courage in resolving it.  Cautiously recommended.",1201478400,,1766,4.922297297297297
3272269,1,B000Z27HMW,"The sheer unadulterated awfulness of this absolutely amazes me.  Fanny Price as a flirty, pouty,  bosoms almost falling out, bottle blonde with bed hair and  an acting style straight out of  ""Tom Jones""  pretty much ruins the whole thing singlehandedly. The intended villainess, Mary Crawford, looks downright demure by comparison and a far more suitable match for a clergyman.  Then there's the inconsistent  uncle  who starts out  Simon Legree and ends up Father Knows Best.  And the otherwise adequate and attractive  actor playing Edmund who's given about 15 seconds of close-up across the family breakfast table to show, with just his face,  the aha! moment when he realizes it's Fanny he loves after all.  That  scene alone may end up  earning  this movie a place in  the so-bad-it's-funny pile. I don't think Jane Austen is turning in her grave; I think she's laughing herself silly at the ludicrousness of it all.",1201478400,36,921,4.993377483443709
3272270,4,B000Z27HMW,"It seems that Jane Austen fans really can't get a good ""Mansfield Park.""  The 1990s version with Frances O'Connor was truer to the plot (minus the added scenes taken from Austen's bio), but altered the spirit and mood of the book as much as it possibly could.  This new version plays fast and loose with the plot, but stays truer to the original intent.

I gave it four stars because even though I'm an obsessive Austen fan, Mansfield Park is by far my least favorite novel, and I think that at least some of the changes made improved on the novel (blasphemy, I know) while still remaining true to the spirit of Jane Austen's story.

The saving grace of this adaptation is Billie Piper's Fanny Price.  I wasn't sure about the casting, because physically they're such opposites.  Billie Piper is full of life and zest, while Fanny ought to be a pale, thin creature who looks as though a gust of wind could blow her away.  But try though I might, I just can't like Fanny until about half way through the book.  Timid, meek, shy, and any other synonymn for it that you can find in the thesaurus; unappreciated by the family that simultaneously depends on her to supply most of their emotional and practical wants and needs; unrequitedly in love with a cousin that sees her as his little sister; and physically weak enough that she's easily exhausted and nearly falls ill after being deprived of her daily exercise of horse-riding for a week, Fanny in the novel seems a creature to be pitied rather than liked.  Billie Piper's character has a gentle and domestic but still very present sense of humor to her, which I think is just what that character needed.  It makes her easily likable, without departing from the shyness and home-bound-ness that form the core of Fanny's character.  Also, seeing Fanny in the beginning truly happy with her family life (inspite of her underapprecation and a little pining for Edmund) before the Crawfords come makes the story that much more appealing and her situation much more moving.  Fanny's life in the book consists of almost unmitigated misery.  She's always a little homesick for her parents and siblings, even though she's been away too long for anyone besides William to be really family anymore.  She's overworked by Lady Bertram, who means no harm but is too lazy to notice what she's doing, constantly tormented and slighted by Aunt Norris, nearly despairing in her love for Edmund, ignored by her other cousins, terrified of her uncle, and tormented by constant guilt and shame that she does not love enough or feel enough gratitude for these people who have such little affection for her.  When the Crawfords upset the balance of her life, it just seems more misery steeped on top of what's already there.

I also liked Fanny's decision to ask for a picnic instead of a ball.  It's easier to appreciate a shy woman's preference for an easy and playful family gathering instead of a fancy formal party than to feel sympathy for a heroine, however painfully shy, whose suffers through the horrible experience of having her wealthy family throw a ball in her honor.  And I like that we get to see Fanny playing with children.  I don't think Jane Austen liked children much; her comments on them are very sharp in all her books, and even moreso in her letters.  But Fanny's love of children adds real dimension to her controlling desire to make houses into homes, and as much as I understand how hard it must be to inhabit a home with a large number of mainly spoiled and undisciplined children after growing up in an environment so formal as to be sterile, Fanny's painfilled reaction when she visits her parents in the book and is constantly unsettled by their loud brood of wild and active children makes it harder for me to like her, especially since her ambition is to fulfill a domestic role.  How is she to be a mother if she can't bear noise and naughty behavior?  I guess I just don't like delicate flowers very much.  Billie Piper's Fanny is tweaked just enough to prevent her from being one.

There were some changes I didn't like.  Fanny's decision to stick to her guns about not performing in the play was the one thing I liked about her in the early chapters of the book.  It redeemed her character for me that as much as she may mistrust her own judgements, she at least had the courage of her convictions where she believed a moral code was at stake.  That Fanny let's herself be talked into participating in the movie tarnishes her character for me.

Mrs. Norris is barely horrid at all in this version, and I think that even if you are going to soften her character, she needs to be at least as annoying as Lady Catherine De Bourgh to do justice to her character.  And while the actors playing the Crawfords did wonderful jobs with the material they were given, I still felt something was missing.  Henry and Mary Crawford are the most interesting characters in the novel, even though they are too selfish for us to want them to get with the heroes.  The juxtaposition of their long habits of bad behavior with the desire and potential to be good shown by their loving the two most moral characters of the play is something that could and should have been played with more.  Neither movie version I've seen makes enough of the real affection Mary had for Fanny as well, though this one comes much closer than the '90s version.

On more minor details, Sir Thomas was a little too inconsistant, playing too cruel at some points and too warm at others, with little gradation or reasons given for the changes.  Lady Bertram's warmth added some nice depth and likability to her character, without seriously undermining her overall laziness, unwillingness to think beyond her own comfort, and dependance on her husband that are her distinguishing traits.  The change of Fanny's being sent home for her being abandoned in an empty Mansfield Park was regrettable, but excusable for the simplification it brought.  The styling of Fanny's hair has been much complained about; but since lose hair was allowed for children and for the lower classes at the time, and since it was paired with comparatively old-fashioned and cheap clothing for Fanny versus the other characters, I viewed it as symbolic of both her sweet and simple personality, and her family's refusal to think of Fanny as enough of a woman and a lady to need to put her hair up:  to them she's still the poor peasant girl they've adopted.  And anyway, it's pretty.

Edmund was excellent:  more likable and interesting than in the book, and the sudden shift of his affection onto Fanny was both played and writted believably and adorably, again more so than it was in the book.

I can't help concluding, though, that we're still waiting for an adaptation that will manage to do all three:  be true to Austen's plot, true to Austen's spirit, and yet still believable and engaging for a modern audience.  Difficult as the book is to adapt, I think it could be done with the right vision; and maybe it would even be possible to find an interpretation at once so true and so good that it would send me back into the book with new eyes, ready to enjoy this great work of Jane's as much as I do the other five that she left us.",1201392000,11,7236,4.6203125
3272271,1,B000Z27HMW,"While Mansfield Park is not the most appealing of the Austen novels, it deserved a better effort than this latest version. Most fans of Austen have read the original books, so we understand much of the manners, custom and dress of the times, and have certain expectations. Other reviewers have pointed out the problems, and I agree with them. I also could not get past Fanny's appearance (which was more like a bar maid than even a servant) to have any empathy for the character. I did not understand the director's decision to dress everyone else in the piece for the period and not the main character. Keeping every scene in one spot and mostly in the same room might have been cost effective but hardly does justice to the richer world that Austen was so adept at portraying. Although I own most DVD versions of other Austen productions, I know I will not want to see this again. My recommendation is to watch it on PBS or rent it before you buy.",1201392000,72,949,4.491329479768786
3272272,2,B000Z27HMW,"This is not Jane Austen's ""Mansfield Park""--it's another story altogether, from another place and time.  The first, and establishing portion, of the novel has completely disappeared, the themes of the Austen book have vanished, the language is pure 21st century, and the characters, their bearing and their manners bear no resemblance to the originals--the actors just happen to be wearing Regency garb.

I would have no objection to, and would in fact enjoy, watching a good melodrama decked out in 18th century costumes--just don't try to tell me that this is ""Mansfield Park.""",1201392000,44,579,5.21505376344086
3272273,4,B000Z27HMW,"All of the novels in the new BBC series so far have been altered, jumbled, and severely cut to fit within the confines of approximately 90 minutes of screen time. ""Mansfield Park"" suffers further from oddities in casting: Billie Piper, though plain enough and believably pious, is far too lively a character for Fannie, and Blake Ritson is much too handsome for Edmund. One of Jane Austen's consistent points is that her heroes and heroines are not strikingly handsome, but only near it and, as is psychologically sound, become better looking as their characters are revealed to their potential suitors. Ritson would have better fitted Austen's vision if he'd been cast as Henry Crawford. Beautiful, but depraved Mary Crawford, on the other hand, is perfectly cast.

 Apart from the weak points just mentioned, I think ""Mansfield Park"" the best of the series so far. It's the truest to Jane Austen's vision. Thus we have retained here the corruption of the witty, attractive, big city young people set against the relative paleness of the conventional country dwellers, Fanny and Edmund, who've internalized the values that represent the best of the Mansfield life. Never simple in confounding virtue with mere geography, Austen as well as her adapters here shows the parental failure of Mansfield's Sir Thomas in having overseen only his daughter's manners, not their moral education. Corruption can bloom then in the countryside as well as in the big city.

The novel ""Mansfield Park,"" which is the favorite of high-Janeites, turns on the conflict between cleverness and goodness. In most of Jane Austen, a combination of both qualities in the main characters is the ideal. Think Elizabeth Bennett or Elinor Dashwood. Here, though, push comes to shove, and the author's judgment is that in a conflict comparatively dull goodness is vastly preferable to witty heartlessness. Happily, the TV adaptation has had the courage to remain true to the author's values.",1201305600,10,1961,5.141065830721003
3272274,3,B000Z27HMW,"Of the three iTV 90-minute films done this year, Mansfield Park is my least favorite:
Persuasion and Northanger Abbey were just much better done (even with their faults & foibles).  As always, there is not a great adaptation of Mansfield Park available: the 80's version is fairly true to the book, but that Fanny is not my favorite in casting: the 90's version is too modernernized, and this one again, just ends up missing the mark.  For one, the story is too much condensed, with so much being left out, that I was almost shocked, for one, to have met Mr Rushworth within the first 4 minutes of the film.

The casting of Billie Piper worked out somewhat: she does a good job of being active of mind and body, but never quite gets the tone of humbleness and quiet servitude which should also accompany this, in the person of Fanny Price.  Her blond hair hanging loose and wild (it's never up in a proper Regency hairdo) is far too unrealistic for me, to what would have been expected of a young Regency woman, poor dependent or not (I'm sorry, but her hair would have always been up or pulled back!  EXCEPT maybe when she's in her own bedroom).  Blake Ritson as Edmund is fine casting, as well as Hayley Atwell as Mary Crawford, Joseph Beattie as Henry Crawford, and Jemma Redgrave as Lady Betram.  I found the whole story a bit rushed and stilted, and it seemed to be a whirlwind: if I, avid reader of Jane Austen, had trouble following the storyline, how much more so would someone who had not read the book?

Content: there are some things to be aware of: some cleavage is shown, sexual innuendos, an engaged woman kisses a man who is not her fianc, there is talk of a scandal where a married woman runs off with another man, a scene where a woman is washing her hair in a basin and a man comes in to talk with her, there is not much else: it is pretty tame.

Although it was a bit of a disappointment, I can appreciate certain moments in the film, where the fine acting of some shines through, and with good costuming to eye and things along that line, it is an enjoyable way to wile away 90 minutes: not up to par they way that I would have hoped, but all in all, and enjoyable version of Mansfield Park until one better comes along.",1199836800,64,2240,4.339712918660287
3272275,4,B000Z27HMW,"This may not be the perfect adaptation fans have been waiting for, but for a low-budget production, it wasn't too bad. The casting was nearly perfect, though Billie Piper may not have been ideal for Fanny. She still did a decent job pulling off the role. Edmund, Mary, Mr. Bertram, and Mrs. Norris were all superb in this film! Mrs. Bertram was altered slightly from the book, but I thought it was for the better.

SPOILERS BELOW!!
Just like all low-budget productions, scenes and characters from the book were cut. Most I could accept, like not visiting the Price family. But I do wish they had kept the ball in. Instead they changed it to a picnic. Also they didn't have Henry Crawford leave before Maria was married, making the scene between her and Mr. Bertram (where Maria insists on marrying Mr. Rushworth despite the easy out her father is offering her) confusing and gives Maria a poorer character than in the book.

Overall, this adaptation was decent. Certainly better than the terrible '97 movie.",1198368000,28,1007,4.748571428571428

8234650,4,B000Z27HMW,"For a movie that, to my knowledge, was only ever played on TV, this is a nice little flick to put on whenever I'm in the mood for a more casual period piece that benefits from modern film making equipment. I will admit that there is a lot lacking--a lot has changed from the book and the film is definitely much lighter rendition of Mansfield Park that takes away from Fanny's emotional pull and deep character, which is perhaps one of Austen's most mature. The idea of this film is really a more loosely inspired take that wants to focus on a sweet, mild love between Edmund and Fanny and to not be as serious and intense as it could have been. Maria's infidelity is presented and used as more of a convenient plot point that wraps up the loose ends and takes care of a few problems, rather than be a major event for the family and characters that changes a lot for them. It's a lower budget production, but still manages to be generally entertaining and visually appealing. I could honestly sink my claws into this film and rip apart its problems and screenplay choices, but I'm judging it more on the fact that I generally like to watch this for fun. If you really care about the book to film accuracy and want a more serious film, this version would not suit, but for something easy to digest and overall nice to watch this doesn't hurt. I bough a copy of the DVD for cheap, since it's something I like to pop in and have play in the background as I work on stuff.
