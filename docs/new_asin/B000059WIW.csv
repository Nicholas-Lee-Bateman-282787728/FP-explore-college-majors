1409770,5,B000059WIW,"I have just watched ECW Deep Impact and all I can say is WOW! As a big fan of ECW for a long time I did not think they could bring out a video that would be better than the 19 I all ready have but they have done it. The Sabu Vs Terry Funk lived up to the hype as these guys give it 100% and prove that they are the hardest working wrestlers on the planet. Buy This Video and all the others and have the best wrestling company in your house.  ECW, ECW, ECW, ECW, ECW, ECW, ECW, ECW, ECW,",988156800,,486,3.7184466019417477
1409771,5,B000059WIW,"This is the third installment in ECW's ""Best of"" DVD series.  Not having been able to follow ECW during its ""Golden"" years (it didn't air out in my area) I quickly purchased this DVD.  In my opinion, it was money well spent.  The DVD features 7 matches (actually 9 if you think about it, more on that later...) plus some GREAT DVD extras.  Here's the match rundown:
1. Mikey Whipwreck vs The Sandman (w/ Woman) vs ""Superstar"" Steve Austin (12/9/95):  Three-way dance for the ECW Heavyweight title.  The match itself was fairly average, BUT it alone delivered more than its fair share of ""money's worth"" material on this DVD.  Obviously, ECW is trying to ride on Stone Cold's coat tails.  The intro to the match (via video packages) actually follows most of Austin's ECW career highlighting his feud with the Sandman and his quest to beat Mikey Whipwreck for the ECW Heavyweight title.  The video package actually shows most of Austin's first match with Mikey where Mikey upsets the ""Stone Cold Superstar"" for the win.  The match itself was average but is on its own more like two matches (Mikey vs. Austin, Austin vs. Sandman).  Great technical wrestling with Austin and Mikey and decent hardcore match with Austin and the Sandman.  Overall, a great look for Austin fans at his ""pre-Stone Cold"" days.  4 stars.
2. Terry Funk vs. Sabu (8/9/97):  Bared wire match for the ECW Heavyweight title. Brutal hardcore match bound to leave you cringing with great hardcore spots.  Everything gets torn to shreds.  Brutal (and a little spooky) ending where everything ends in a tangled mess. Plus, a ""cameo appearance"" by Rob Van Dam. (5 stars).
3. Taz vs. Bam Bam Bigelow (3/1/98):  Classic match for the TV title.  Tons of action between two world-class competitors.  Great wrestling action combining good mat wrestling, power spots and some hardcore spots thrown in.  In fact, the battle was so great that not even the ring itself could support this colossal battle.  SHOCKING ending.  Definite keeper.  4  stars.
4. Terry Funk and The Sandman vs. Cactus Jack and Shane Douglas (3/18/95):  Great hardcore garbage match with four ECW/hardcore legends.  Non-stop garbage spot fest.  Plus, the fire-branding iron.  4  stars.
5. Masato Tanaka and Jerry Lynn vs. Mike Awesome and Justin Credible (7/18/98):  Huh?  When did these guys ever team up?  At first I was a little skeptical on this match when I saw it on the line-up, BUT this match totally delivers the goods.  Tanaka vs. Awesome is ALWAYS a great fight.  Toss in Jerry Lynn and it's a keeper.  AWESOME match combining the best in technical mat wrestling, power moves, aerial spots and of course, hardcore action spots with chairs and yes, tables. Great, great, great match.  5 stars.
6. Yoshihiro Tajiri vs. Psicosis (8/19/00):  Again, I was slightly skeptical at them choosing this very recent match over something from their golden era from 95-96 but after viewing this match I can easily see why they did.  One word sums this match.  WOW!!!!  UNBELIEVABLE action between these two.  One of the great things that set ECW apart from the rest was the incredible in-ring product and these two International superstars delivered the goods.  AWESOME work rate featuring incredible mat wrestling and breathing taking aerial spots.  Pure athleticism at its best.  5 stars and a bag of chips.
7. Francine vs. Beulah McGuillicutty (with Raven) (8/26/95):  Special guest referee Stevie Richards.  The original catfight.  Not exactly a wrestling classic, but definitely an ECW classic with GREAT T&A.
Aside from the great matches, to me, the real selling point of this DVD is the DVD special features which include:
1. Promo Montage:  One of the better features in the DVD special features.  A montage of ECW promos including:  Tommy Dreamer, Cactus Jack, the Dudley Boyz (Buh Buh, D-von, Sign Guy, Dances With, Big Dick), the Steiner Brothers, Public Enemy, the Eliminators, Raven, etc...
2. Steve Austin promo:  His debut promo where he debuted as ""The Stevester.""  Plus, appearances by the Public Enemy and the Gangstas.
3. Extreme Moment:  ""Fonzy"" Bill Alfonso vs. Beulah McGuillicutty.  Another ECW classic.  By no means a stellar match but mighty entertaining (and hilarious) to watch.
4. Cactus Jack promo:  A decent promo.  Jewel for Foley fans.
5. Wrestler bios.  More bios written by Michael Johnson II.  Once again, a nice extra but nothing earth shattering.
In addition to all of this, like Path of Destruction, this DVD also features ANOTHER HIDDEN PROMO.  However, it's not another must see with the late Brian Pillman.  This DVD has a ""hidden"" Austin promo doing an Eric Bischoff skit.  Short, but VERY hilarious.  To access it, go to chapter 6.  If that doesn't work, just keep looking.  You'll find it.
Overall, AWESOME DVD.  Here's my rundown:
Great:  The Promo montage, classic ECW.  Personally, the DVD extras are the real stars of this DVD.  With the quality of the action that's actually saying a lot.  The match with Tajiri and Psicosis was AWESOME.
Good:  The other matches.  The list of matches may at first be a little unassuming but they picked some great matches this time around.  Honestly, not really a bad match on this.  Classic ECW.
Bad:  Nothing!!!
Summed up, GREAT action, GREAT extras.  GREAT DVD.  Great investment for ECW fans and fans of great action.  Worth buying?  You bet.
Recommended.",987984000,20,5367,4.936026936026936
1409772,5,B000059WIW,"Once again a great DVD from the now dead ECW promtion.  Like they knew they were going down as they speak of the Deep Impact this company had on the wrestling business.(ultimately killing them with other promotions taking their wrestlers and ideas)  A little bit of everything including a recent Psicosis agains Tajiri match that prooved ECW still had great wrestling until the end.  Classic matches like the Sabu vs Terry Funk born to be wire match or the original catfight often copy but never quite like this first time.  The best part for me were all the promos extras on the DVD.  The compilation of promos is just awsome a must for the real fan with all the great and even greater ECW moments in it.  The now classic extra for this one is the skit of Stone Cold as Eric Bischoff, just hit your search button for title 6.  Even better at the end they talked about the future DVD coming up, hopefully it will happen even with the bankrupty.",987724800,2,944,4.453488372093023

1409795,5,B000059WIW,"This is the best ECW DVD yet. The triple threat match with Austin(with Hair)vs. Mikey Whipwreck(young ECW Champion)vs. The Sandman. One of the best 3-way brawls I've ever seen. The All time best BARB WIRE matches I've ever seen Featuring SABU & Terry Funk, You can't get more hardcore or bloodier than this match. Bam Bam Bigelow vs. Taz for the Television title good match with a suprising ending you WILL have to see to believe. & finally Mike Awesome & Justin Credible vs. Jerry Lynn & Masato Tanaka, a mixture of excellent talent equals one of the best tag team action you will ever see!

1409796,3,B000059WIW,"I'm not that into the hardcore part of wrestling, I like the the sports entertainment side and the lucha libre stuff. Some of these ECW fans will give anything that ECW puts out 5 stars but not me.
You'd be WAY better off buying the DVD for the Tajiri-Psicosis match which is awesome, the catfight is good and all the extras including some cool Steve Austin promos, one as Eric Bishoff, they are not that good but its nice to see him before the WWF maybe since the WWF is so stale right now, anything different is good.
Whipwreck-Sandman-Austin is boring and [junky].
Taz-Bam Bam I thought would be better, all that happens is Bigelow goes through the ring, DUD.
Funk-Sabu is not bad but only for the craziness involved when you have barbed wire around the ring, pretty sick if you ask me.
Funk & Sandman vs Cactus & Douglas is a snoozefest.
Tanaka & Lynn vs Awesome & Creadible was good, I liked this more than I thought I would.
Definitely don't buy the video, maybe the DVD. If you want a good DVD buy RR 2000 or Hardy Boyz-Leap of Faith, I'd leave this alone unless you want a first taste of ECW then buy it or if you can rent it, god knows which video store would have it though.",1020470400,,1184,4.290178571428571

1409798,4,B000059WIW,"DEEP IMPACT UNCENSORED VHS is harcore,brutal and savage. ECW style of wrestling. There is 5 matches on this vhs. There where all good.
1st match:ECW World Heavyweight Championship
Mikey Whipwreck vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin back when he was in ECW in 95 vs. The Sandman. This match was good. It was funny to see Austin with long hair. Want was funny to. Was Mickey, because it his under 220 pounds .He his a cruiserweight or a lightheavyweight compare to Austin and The Sandman. One feature highlight:Sandman getting push trew a table outside the ring by Austin. I won't give more feature because you will buy this vhs. This match is not to bad.
2nd match:ECW World Heavyweight Championship(Barbwire surrounding the ring)(ECW Born to be Wired 97)This match is sick but
cool! harcore wrestling by these two wrestlers. I was surprise by
what this wrestlers did to each other. This is a match with lots of bloods. My best match on this vhs.
3rd match:ECW World Television Championship(ECW Living Dangerously 98)Taz vs. Bam Bam Bigelow. Taz is small compare to Bam Bam Bigelow but my god he cound fight with anybody bigger them him.
You have to see they end. It amazing. This is my 2nd favorite match on this vhs.
4th match:Terry Funk and The Sandman vs. The Franchise Shane Douglas and Cactus Jack. This match was not to bad .This match included:Chairs,alote of clothelines and a fiery ending because of the Funker. They end was cool!.
Last match:Masato Tanaka and Jerry Lynn vs. Mike Awesome and Justin Credible. This was a good tag teams match. Neither of the
2 teams had the ECW World tag teams belts back then. But it was a normal tag teams match. One feature highlight:When Tanaka does a ddt on Justin into 2 chairs. I never saw such a thing like that in WWF and WCW and it was amazing. This match included:Two chairs and one table. So i consider buy this tape you won't be dissapointed.",1012348800,,1889,4.658682634730539
1409799,2,B000059WIW,"I have purchased all four Best of ECW dvd's without ever seeing an ECW match other than Anarchy Rulz 2001, which I attended.  All four are decent, but not if you're looking for pure blood and guts violence as I was.  I enjoyed all of them....with the exception of this one.
First off, ECW is overrated.  If you're a casual wrestling fan and never saw ECW but heard what a tremendous organization it was......well, it wasn't.  There are some good matches on the DVD, but they aren't ""classic"" wrestling matches that anyone needs to have.
Taz vs. Bam Bam Bigelow is great.  It's a nice match since Taz is about 200 pounds lighter than Bam Bam, and 2 feet shorter, and he still gets some a** kicking in. Sandman vs. Austin vs. Whipwreck is actually very good, because it combines technical wrestling, which Austin used to be a master of, with hardcore violence, which really interested me the most.  Overall, I was disappointed with the rest of the matches.  Terry Funk is on this DVD twice.  And in both matches, the man is older than 50 and has no knees left.  So the matches are just him getting bladed with barbed wire (against Sabu) which is sick, but lacklustre, and teaming up with the Sandman vs. Cactus Jack and Shane Douglas.  Personally, I would rather see Cactus on the DVD twice than than Methusala in tights.  Francine and Buellah was billed as a classic match......with no explanation as to why because it is terrible.  Psychosis vs. Tajiri...well, it's o.k., but not the classic match it's been talked up to be.
Nothing on this DVD is imperative to have, with the exception of maybe Funk vs. Sabu since they tear each other apart and Taz vs. Bam Bam.  The only reason to really buy this DVD is if you are a true ECW fan, which I am not, as most if it is just filler from their archives.  I've heard about or seen most of the classic matches ECW had in the past, and there are probably only two on here that I would say are really classic matches.",1011571200,,1959,4.435754189944134
1409800,4,B000059WIW,"Sandman vs. Steve Austin vs. Mickey Whipwreck: Before the actual match Joey Styles shows us some clips that progressed up to this match. Now for the match itself, it was pretty decent, as Mikey and Steve put on a good preformance. Then Sandman came out and took forever to get in the ring, as he had to finish his beer. Then when he got in it was just brawlin' from the point forward. Good match 3/5 Stars
Terry Funk vs. Sabu: This was definetly a jaw dropper, as thesae guys put their bodies on the line for the fans. Very brutal match that will have you anticipating the next move. Very twisted ending. 4.5/5 Stars - For brutality!
Taz vs. Bam Bam Bigalow: This was the show stealer, you have to get the DVD for this match. I thought it was amazing, and showed how much Bam Bam was mis-used as a WCW and WWF star. Same goes for Taz, who right now Is getting jobbed to just about everyone.
Very good ending, which some people have given away, but In case you haven`t read the spoilers, I won`t speak of it. Great match 5/5.
The Sandman and Terry Funk vs. Cactus Jack and Shane Douglas: I must have a different ECW Extreme Evolution, because I don`t have this match on my DVD copy. Well onto the match...This was a very good tag match, and Cactus gets TORCHured at the end. This match envolved everything, from chairs to steel guard rails, and so much more. I give the match 3.5/5 Stars.
Jerry Lynn and Masato Tanaka vs. Mike Awesome and Justin Credible: This was another one of my favorites, lots of insane dives to the outside. The match was just very good, match had a chair, and a Table involved. Great Match, I could pop this in to watch all the time. I give the match 4.5/5 Stars
Tajiri vs. Psichosis: I didn`t see what everyone else saw, I like more aerial moves then submissions and holds, but from a Lucha Libre look it was pretty good. I give the match 4/5
Francince vs. Beulah: This cat fight was pretty entertaining, for the men. I give this match 4/5 for T&A.
Bonus features include:
Various Promos, including The Stevester`s(Steve Austin) first debut promo.
Talent Bios
Plus, you get a Bill Alfonso and Beulah one on one match! Which is very bloody!",1009497600,,2163,4.396508728179551

1409815,3,B000059WIW,"Pretty good effort from ECW here.  Of course, the vampires give all these matches good ratings, that they mostly don't deserve.  Giving something five stars means the match is perfect, no flaws whatsoever, and Sabu stopping midmatch to fix his filleted arm does not make a perfect match. That said, there is still some good stuff on here, not as good as Path of Destruction, but still good.  The best match on here is probably the Tanaka/Lynn vs. Awesome/Credible tag match.  Fast paced match with a hot crowd makes this one good.
Worst match is probably a tie between Funk/Sabu and Francine/Beulah.  The former ""match"" might have been good if Sabu hadn't shredded his arm because both guys have a penchant for violence unmatched by anyone else in ECW at the time.  Another pick with this match is the integration of actual wrestling into the match.  They probably attempted moves in this match because of people who bitch about them having no moveset, but that just negates the entire point of a barbed wire match:  To beat the hell out of your opponent.  Unless you enjoy someone attempting self-surgery midmatch, take a pass on this one.  The women's match is obviously thrown on their to satisfy the horny teenager contingent, and while it may do it's job something more worthwhile could have been included like Raven/Richards vs. The Pitbulls.
Other Notes:  The three way match is pretty boring as Austin is obviously way too mat-based and more talented than the high-flying, spot-oriented Whipwreck and the ""I brawl to cover up my crappy skills"" style of the Sandman.  Flat match.
Taz and Bigelow is okay from a wrestling standpoint and pretty impressive from a entertainment standpoint, although looking back on it, it isn't as impressive seeing as how better bumps have been done since then.  Watchable for some okay action and if your interested in why everyone applauds this match because of a previously impressive spot that doesn't stand up now.
The Funk/Sandman vs. Douglas/Jack match is tossed on here to satisfy the gore-hungry.  Nothing better than anything you'll see on RAW or SmackDown this week, and for the aforementioned gore-hungry you get to see Funk brand Jack with a steaming branding iron.
Lastly, Tajiri and Psicosis is a great match that should satisfy any wrestling fan, regardless of tastes.  Good, fast-paced, high-flying match.  Minus a few for the blown top-rope rana, though.
Overall, a good dvd to get, extras include Cactus Jack and Steve Austin giving their respective interviews and Fonzie v. Beulah.  Interviews are good but pass on the last one.",994982400,,2586,4.949074074074074
1409816,4,B000059WIW,"ECW's 2nd DVD/Video release and this one is not dissapointing!! here are the matches
The Sandamn vs. Steve Austin vs. Mikey Whipwreck - Mikey had just won the world title from the sandman thanks to austin. before this match begins they give us a builup to it showing how Mikey won the title and how austin beat up sandman and took his place in a title match in which mikey wins. pretty slow match for ecw!! Mikey saves the first part but when he gets out it's boring!! just a wrestling match. I like those matches but If you are a hardcore extreme fan this math won't float your boat. MY RATING: ***
Sabu vs. Terry Funk in barbed wire match nothing I can say can explain how hardcore and extreme this match is!! I never in my wildest dreams pictured this!!!

Steve Austin vs. Mikey Whipwreck vs. The Sandman: A pretty good match that starts off slow but gets going when Sandman finally makes his appearance about seven minutes into the match. Pretty standard ECW fare in this match. Plus you get a look at the events that led up to it.(***)
Sabu vs. Terry Funk: Born to Be Wired. one the sickest matches you'll ever see state-side. I've never seen anything like it. There is just too much barbed wire. So much that at the end of the match they become entangled with it and have to be cut free. (*****)
Taz vs. Bam Bam Bigelow: Another great match featuring Taz (Boy, is the WWF wasting his talent.) Some really great hard-hitting spots. The end of this match simply cannot be topped. (***1/2)
The Sandman and Terry Funk vs. Cactus Jack and Shane Douglas: This is a great garbage match with basically all the participants beating tthe hell out of each other for 15 minutes before Funk burns Cactus with a branding iron.(***1/4)
Jerry Lynn and Masato Tanaka vs. Justin Credible and Mike Awesome: Whenever Tanaka and Awesome are involved you know it's going to be a great match, and this one doesn't disappoint.(****1/2)
Psicosis vs. Yoshihiro Tajiri: This surprised me. It turned out to be, arguably the best match on here. So many great spots that it's mind blowing.(*****)
Francine vs. Beulah: The supposed original catfight. Not much of a wrestling match with Stevie Richards refereeing and Raven interfering. Basically just glorified T&A (DUD)for the wrestling (*****) for T&A.
Special features: The features on this disc are by far the best in the series.
Promos: The promo montage is great, but the promos featuring Cactus Jack and Steve Austin are must haves. There's also a hidden promo with Austin making fun of Bischoff and WCW.
Extreme Moments: Bill Alfonso vs. Beulah. This was supposed to be a mixed tag but came down to Fonsie taking on Beulah. Fonsie gets hit with a pan and bled so badly that it looked like a faucet.

And Sabu and the Funker cannot be missed, they are the craziest s.o.b's to put out such an intense match.  Taz and Bigelow is also has a ECW trademark in thier match, the ending cannot be missed.

What I got was perhaps the best DVD ECW has released.
Here are the Top Five reasons to purchase this DVD (in no particular order):
1.  Funk v. Sabu -  Take down the ring ropes . . . put up some barbed wire.  The violence in this match is at times disturbing and the end is surreal, as the two men lay immobilized in their own devastation.
2.  Taz v. Bigelow -  Bigelow battles for the title in his home town of Ashbury Park, NJ.  Taz demonstrates phenominal in-ring skill, and Bigelow cements his place as one of the world's most agile big men.  The conclusion couldn't have been planned.  It just couldn't have.
3.  Tajiri v. Psicosis -  I fully expected to watch this one time and then never again.  Two good workers, but no real heat between each other.  I couldn't have been more wrong.  This is what wrestling is all about.  These two guys put a brick on the gas pedal and tear the roof off the building!  Intense, high-risk, technically excellent.  Look up ""5 Star Match"" in the dictionary . . . this is what you'll see.
4.  Promo Montage The best ""special feature"" on an ECW DVD so far.  (Aside from hidden features, of course.)  Smart, funny, serious as a heart attack . . . some of the greatest promos in ECW history.
5.  Fonzy v. Beulah McGuillicutty Men vs. women matches are terrible.  Always.  This one makes the cut because Fonzy is out of his mind.  When most men in the WWF wouldn't sell (pretend to be hurt by) for Chyna, this guy fought a 110 lb. woman and left wearing the crimson mask of pain.  And I bet he got paid about $100 for his efforts.  Unreal.
Best of the four?  Tough call, but check it out and see for yourself.",990057600,2,1878,4.3497109826589595

7934407,5,B000059WIW,"More?  The structure of the DVD is identical to that of ECW's ""Path of Destruction"".  There seems to be nothing ECW can do wrong, and this DVD showcases shining examples of this.

The best of ECW matches part 2, so to speak, this DVD is pretty much what you expect from ECW, but also includes bonus promos which showcase another great aspect of ECW, including the promo featuring Steve Austin imitating Hulk Hogan.

Two matches stand out in my mind, however.  The best one and the worst one.

Yoshihiro Tajiri vs Psicosis
To any critic of ECW who thinks it too violent, too bloody, too raunchy, anything like that, this is the absolute antithesis of that all.  In the same vein as Eddie Guerrero vs Dean Malenko in their last ECW match, this one was no weapons, no blood, pure raw athletic wrestling at its best, with no fake-punches, and amazing feats of chain-wrestling, technical wrestling, and high flying from two guys who look, to the average eye, normal, or even handsome to some.  The shining example of what makes up ECW---not just violence, wrestling.

Beulah McGillicuty vs Francine
Unfortunately, ECW doesn't break the mold of the women's division being mediocre.  There was a lot of nothing in this match as Beulah catfights Francine, then slowly strips her down.  Francine botches most, if not all moves given to her, including completely fumbling a sidekick by Stevie Richards, and selling Raven's kick to the gut about a half second too late.  If you like women in bra and panties catfighting... this one would be good for you, but you can see that in the WWE all the time.

7934409,4,B000059WIW,"NOTE: I UPDATED THIS REVIEW IN 2013

ECW Champion Mikey Whipwreck vs. Sandman vs. Steve Austin - After Austin's embarrassing defeat by Whipwreck at the previous event, he came into this match more serious (such as his Bruce Willis ""Pulp Fiction"" buzz haircut) & showing more respect to Mikey with clean breaks in the corner & handshakes before he would eventually get more aggressive towards Mikey. Sandman eventually joined the match minutes later causing Mikey to attempt to go after both men with a frankensteiner & dive over the top rope before Austin & Sandman brawled on the outside going in the crowd with Austin using whatever he could get his hands on including a table, chair, ringside cable, and later some brass knuckles while continuing to mock Sandman with his own beer. This wasn't much as far as a triple threat match goes as it came off more as a gauntlet match for Austin with him fighting Mikey in the first half & Sandman in the second half & isn't really only relevant as being Austin's second & last match in ECW.

[Legacy Of Stone Cold Steve Austin]

Barbed Wire Match: ECW Champion Terry Funk vs. Sabu - Both men started out avoiding the wire early while trying to execute some offense with Sabu's Camel Clutch & Funk working over the neck with a hangmans neckbreaker & piledriver while being able to sent Sabu into the wire first raking it across the face & then crotched Sabu on it that just shredded his tights but Sabu was able to send Funk into the wire multiple times including having him tied up in the wire & ripping his face against it while also stabbing him with a peace of the wire.  There was a moment where Sabu's bicept was ripped open in the wire & had to tape it shut which allowed an opening for Funk who just took advantage continuing to work over his neck with a hangmans neckbreaker across open chairs & even making Bill Alfonzo pay for trying to get involved resulting him being a victim of the wire itself before Sabu came back using the wire cutters & ringside table as a weapon along with turning his body into a human pin cushion with the wire.  This match can only be summerised by the statement Paul Heyman made in regards to it, ""I never booked another barbed wire match after this because nobody could top that one...and in good conscience, I didn't want anyone to try.""
[Bloodsport: ECW's Most Violent Matches]

Television Champion Taz vs. Bam Bam Bigelow - Bam Bam Bigelow was in his hometown of Asbury Park as this match started off hot with Taz kept taking down Bigelow with an armbar & hip lock before taking him over the top with a clothesline but Bigelow regained control catching Taz on the outside followed by a powerbomb in the ring before the match got taken back to the outside with Taz delievering a suplex off the ramp into the crowd with him hitting his own head on the guardrail coming down.  Both men delivered some impactful moves to each other like Bigelow's twisting top rope moonsault, Taz dead lifting Bigelow through a table, one man punching through a piece of table to hit the other guy, and resorting to low blows before something happened that resulted in one of the most infamous moments in ECW history to the point where it was still replayed in the opening credits of the show after both men had left the company.  This was definately an physical match as both men went stiff against each other at times & the finish was definitely described by the fans in attendance, ""Holy S....!""

Shane Douglas & Cactus Jack vs. Sandman & Terry Funk - Both men started brawling right away both in & outside of the ring with Douglas using Sandman's cane on everyone including hitting his own partner while Cactus was using chairshots & his trademark over the top rope clotheslines on Sandman & Funk before continuing to brawl on the floor with Funk throwing whatever he could get his hands on along with being on the receiving end of some double teaming by Cactus & Douglas like an atomic legdrop.  Sandman & Funk used a guardrail as a weapon slamming it onto Douglas before crotching him & clotheslining him off of it before both teams brawled towards the entrance way with Cactus delivering a DDT on the floor & Terry Funk attempting to use a tool box followed by bringing out the flaming branding iron.  This was the wild & out of control brawl expected with all of the name involved.

Masato Tanaka & Jerry Lynn vs. Mike Awesome & Justin Credible - Both individuals on each time were involved in heated feuds throughout the summer resulting in this tag match that saw Awesome & Tanaka going at right right away with hard chops & implementing a chair right away with a running chair from the entrance away but Awesome was able to recover & kept shoving off Lynn's offense using his power launching Lynn into the air allowing the opening for Credible to take advantage while Lynn was down with Awesome & Tanaka eventually getting tagged back in delivering some impactful offense such a shoulderblock, german suplex from the top rope, and an Alabama Slam.  Both teams continued to trade momentum such as Lynn with a springboard crossbody onto Credible in the front row while Awesome did a top rope dive onto Tanaka into the front row on the other side of the ring, Awesome delivering a top rope splash onto Tanaka only for Lynn to drop a top rope legdrop onto Credible, a tornado DDT onto chairs, and a release Awesome Bomb over the top rope through a table.  A hot tag match from start to finish.
""Hardcore TV"" July '98

Yoshihiro Tajiri vs. Psichosis - This was Psichosis ECW Arena return after over 3 years only this time unmasked (thanks WCW!) as they started out within the first minute trading various stretch submissions such as Psichosis having Tajiri's arms in a leg scissors only for Tajiri to reverse it into a modified single leg crab & Psichosis reversing that into a bow & arrow before attempting offense only to result in back to back stalemates causing Psichosis to take some risk that didn't work out causing him to fly over the top rope & hitting a photographer in the process followed by both men going aerial with moves like an over the top running somersault dive only to be topped by an over the top rope suicide dive into the front row.  Both men traded momentum with moves like an attempted running body scissors into a wheelbarrow suplex, missing a charge & getting crotched on the top turnbuckle, tree of woe baseball slide, a brainbuster countered into a stunner, top rpoe legdrop, countering a flying body scissors with a groin kick, and various kicks.  This was a lost encounter during the final months of ECW as we saw Psichosis be the most motivated that we've seen since his early WCW days with his lucha style clashing very well with Tajiri's japanese style.

Francine vs. Beulah McGillicuty - Beulah had her boyfriend Tag Team Champion Raven in her corner while Francine's boyfriend & also Tag Team Champion Stevie Richards was the referee who made every man alive jealous when it came to checking the participants for objects before the women finally went at it tumbling around & eventually disrobing each other when the other one was down from either driving her head into the mat or getting hit with a frying fan but Raven kept getting involved when Francine had the advantage on Beulah eventually causing a confrontation with Stevie forcing him to choose between his idol & his girlfriend.  This match is known as the ""original catfight"" & was more of a segment than a match pushing the issues between both of the men & women in the match so it's not much past seeing women in their underwear.
""Hardcore TV"" Aug. '95

(Bonus) Beulah McGillicutty vs. Bill Alfonzo - This initially started out as a mixed tag match but with Dreamer & RVD out of action, these two continued with Beulah taking a page out of Dreamer's ""Innovator Of Violence"" playbook that resulted in Fonzie busted open after this first move as they took the fight to the front row & back into the ring with Fonzie going low & using his whistle to choke before Beulah fought back beating the hell out of Fonzie with moves like the DDT, frankensteiner, and Dreamer's tree of woe.  Paul Heyman described this as ""5 of the most intense minutes in ECW history"" but it was also the bloodiest match in the history of the company as Alfonzo had to be rused to the hospital right afterwords.

DVD extras include a promo from Cactus Jack, Steve Austin's ""Steve-amanic"" & a hidden ""Monday Niquil"" promos.  There's also a collage of the ""Pulp Fiction"" ECW promos including J.T. Smith, the Dudleys, Eliminators, Tommy Dreamer, Cactus Jack & Raven, Terry Funk, Bill Alfonzo, Tod Gordon, Steve Austin, Woman & Sandman, Mickey Whipwreck, Stevie Richards, Public Enemy along with those who have passed through ECW for a short time like the Steiner Brothers, Konnan, and Rey Mysterio.

With the exception of Beulah vs. Francine (unless your a fan of see both of them in their underwear), every match on here either had a historical purpose (the second & last match match Austin wrestled in ECW) or was quality in it's own right so this is a collection I would recommend for those who don't already have a majority of these matches elsewhere.",1148688000,7,9412,4.632873425314937
7934410,4,B000059WIW,"Here we go:
1. Mikey Whipwreck Vs. Steve Ausin Vs. The Sandman - 3-way elimination match - Whipwreck won the ECW Championship and a fluke and now finds himself between 2 pissed-off drunks. Should've been good, but was pretty boring and way too long. *1/2
2. Terry Funk Vs. Sabu - Barbed Wire match - Sabu wrestled this match shirtless, which is insane in a barbed-wire match. Both men get shredded like crazy with Sabu actually having to tape his arm mid-match because it was bleeding to bad. ***1/2
3. Taz Vs. Bam Bam Bigalow - Kinda slow with bug moves here and then, including a BIG move to finish the match. ***
4. Terry Funk/Sandman Vs. Cactus Jack/Shane Douglas - Wild ECW brawl that uses chairs, tables, canes and everything else they could find. ****
5. Masata Tanaka/Jerry Lynn Vs. Mike Awesome/Justin Credible - 2 feuds collide in 1 tag team match. Awesome/Tanaka is always great, but throw in Jerry Lynn and you've got a great match. ****
6. Psicosis Vs. Tajiri - Both men work the mat with Tajiri kicking the crap outta Psicosis and Psych throwing the aerial moves in between. ****1/2
7. Francine Vs. Beulah - Raven and Steven Richards are guest refs. Francine is with Steven whose with Raven whose with Beulah.. I think I have that right. Not really a match, but you almost see puppies! - DUD
8. Fonzie Vs. Beulah - (In extra section) - Fonzie must've eaten 10 asperins with his bottle of vodka cause he taps a Mutoh scale bloodbath. Like the barbed wire match, it's actually disturbing, but knowing Fonzie somehow survived a loss of most of his blood is amazing!",1078704000,,1576,4.592198581560283
7934411,4,B000059WIW,"Here is a complete rundown of the matches.
1:Mikey Whipwreck vs. Sandman vs. Steve Austin
  This was a decent match. Kinda slow at times but make up for it with some good technical wrestling.
2:Terry Funk vs. Sabu
  One word-WOW.This was a great match. Its amazing what these two men can put their bodies through. It was a very violent and bloody match. The ending of the match is pretty disturbing. If you have never seen a barb wire match,when you see this one,you can't help but to just drop your jaw at some parts.
3:Taz vs. Bam Bam Bigelow
  This was another good match,with a couple nice spots. Taz suplexes bigelow off the entry ramp. But its nothing compared to the ending of the match,which is very cool.
4:Funk and Sandman vs. Cactus Jack and Shane Douglas
 This really wasn't even a tag match,it was just two teams beating the mess out of each other. The match was pretty good but the ending is VERY HOT.LITERALLY.
5:Tanaka and Lynn vs. Awesome and Credible
  This was a good tag match with some good technical wrestling. This match also features a really nice table spot.
6:Tajiri vs. Psicosis
  This was an amazing match. It has alot of high flying moves and the match is very fast paced,both men show some very nice moves. The kicks that Tajiri does in the match are simply awesome,especially at the end.
7:Francine vs. Beulah McGuillicuty
This is definetely the most boring match on the DVD.If you are a fan of T&A,you will definetely like this one. But if not,don't bother watching it.
Extras:Rare Promos,Wrestler bios,and one extreme moment where Bill Alfonso bleeds alot.

This match was fast paced and intence for the entire length of the match (slow pace is often a drawback in no-rope barbed wire matches).  I have seen death matches from IWA (midsouth and Japan), FMW, CZW, XPW, and BJPW, but nothing i have seen has compared to the all around brutality of this match.  Also if you don't like blood, there is a match between Psycosis and Tajiri which is incredibly fast paced and technically sound.  That match is also a five start match.  The rest of the matches on the DVD are good but forgettable.  Nevertheless i encourage you to buy this DVD!",1034121600,,741,4.287769784172662

This match is definetly not for children, nor the faint of heart. If you think you know hardcore wrestling then THINK AGAIN!!! Sabu and Terry Funk collide in one emotional barbed wire hell, all for the glory of wrestling's greatest prize! This match will make WWF's ""Hell In a Cell"" matches look like a walk in park! The 1st match on the video is alright. Steve Austin takes on The Sandman and Mikey Shipreck in a three-way dance. The second match on the video is the bloody barbed wire match between Sabu & Terry Funk. In the 3rd match, Taz takes on Bam Bam Bigelow in an O.K. match up in which Bigelow falls ontop of Taz and the ring caves in----LITERALLY! The fourth match is a tag team match up: Terry Funk & The Sandman vs. Cactus Jack & Shane Douglas. This was a pretty good match up with NO TAGGING but a lot of bloody action and an ending you won't believe! Cactus Jack gets burned---LITERALLY----with a flaming branding iron by Terry Funk! OH, MY GOD!!! The last match on the video is a tag team match with tagging and more competition than mutilation: Mike Awesome & Justin Credible vs. Masato Tanaka & Jerry Lynn. This match got off to a rather slow start but was amazing nonetheless. Great athleticism! This video is not for all tastes but worth the look. Be forewarned: the blood really flows freely!
