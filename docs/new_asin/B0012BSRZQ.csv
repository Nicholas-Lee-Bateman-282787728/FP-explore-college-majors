8244983,4,B0012BSRZQ,"I found this program fascinating because it portrays Army training on missile systems during the early 1950s, the first generation to work with them. At this time guided missiles were still a new technology and this is reflected by the film showing soldiers training on fairly simple weapon systems (such as the V-1/J-1) then progressing to more sophisticated missiles until they are ready to train on the Nike Ajax, the first U.S. surface-to-air missile system. It also discusses how crewman were categorized as ""electronics men"" and ""rocket men"", which carries on today in Air Defense Artillery HIMAD military occupational specialties as missile and radar crewmen. The Big Picture shows the security in force at the time, since missile technology was kept ""close hold"" from America's potential enemies. Overall, a fascinating program. The only thing I didn't like was that it was not long enough.",1303257600,,898,5.243055555555555
8244984,5,B0012BSRZQ,"The Guided Missiles episode of the Big Picture is a snapshot of cutting age military weapons technology from 1962.  It was meant to reassure American viewers that the US military was up to defending the nation against any foe (i.e. the former Soviet Union).  Having been from the last generation the grew up in the last days of the Cold War, it was a nostalgic look at an anxiety filled time in American History.",1289520000,,412,4.554054054054054
