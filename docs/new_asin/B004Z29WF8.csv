4505072,5,B004Z29WF8,"This movie is absolutely stunning on many fronts. Director Maryam Keshavarz surprises the audience by presenting a beautiful, touching and unpredictable love story involving two lesbian youngsters who have to overcome challenges emanated from traditional family values and a jealous brother to be together.  Beside its boldness and courage, the movie accentuates lesibianism which adds a new dimension to Iranian cinema. The acting is phenomenal and the cinematography is amazing.

Visually stunning--- I meant the two lead actresses. I think this movie would have a lot of mainstream appeal if only it had the commercial clout to back it up. Definitely better than the boring and pretentious, ""The Kids Are Alright."" The beautifully shot Circumstance depicts the story of the forbidden love between two teenage girls in contemporary Tehran, the beautiful and privileged Atafeh (Nikohl Boosheri) and the orphaned Shireen (Sarah Kazemy) and their struggle to overcome the societal pressures encroaching on their personal desires. Their journey of sexual rebellion in the underground party scene leads to a series of twists and turns that eventually lands Shireen in prison where she is coerced into marriage with Atafeh's creepy brother, Mehran (Reza Sixo Safai)...
----------------------

I was able to catch the first Canadian premiere of this movie at the Inside Out film festival in Toronto. I can't wait for the DVD to come out since it seems I can't find any screening of it in my local theatres.

Consequently, I've also been scouring the online reviews of this movie. So far the verdict is a little disappointing, but I think the critics are being too harsh, too snobby, too finicky, and overly critical. I know that's their jobs; however, I really don't believe any one of them has given any substantial reason for their tepid reviews. I will not waste your time going through them one by one but my conclusion is that critics barely know what they're talking about.

Forget the critics! Go watch and enjoy this movie! (if you can, it's currently being screened at select cities in the U.S.)

And please, someone at Amazon, get an actual poster of the film for the cover!! I don't know whose face that is!!",1314144000,20,1748,4.915254237288136

SPOLERS!!!!
The scene with the two main actresses dancing in the wedding... The looks were enough to melt you.  The scene where they're in the kitchen the day after was also one of my favorite moments.  The close up shot of her hand when the other woman left... that was beautiful.

Anyway, I appreciate this movie because of that.  If you can appreciate beautiful cinematography/editing that also happens to have a decent lesbian storyline (nothing over-the-top), then you may want to check out this film.

It's the story of two best friends who love each other and struggle against the oppressive, sexist society under the Iranian Revolution, but left completely trapped, they end up helpless to withstand the abuse, control, and sexual assault of the men in power in their society. One of the girls ends up SPOILER ALERT not only accepting a marriage arrangement (to be fair, she doesn't have much of a choice), but seems to accept her husband on some level, even after he rapes her. Honestly, I didn't expect the rapist-sympathetic element in a woman-written and directed film. Maybe it's an accurate depiction of life under the regime rule (although the writer/director was born and raised in the U.S.), but I was left disappointed and a little sick to my stomach. If you're sensitive to these kinds of things, skip this movie.",1372809600,8,982,4.748538011695906
4505214,4,B004Z29WF8,I loved The idea behind the movie but wishes it went further with the women. The brother was such a creep,1370044800,,105,4.0476190476190474
4505235,4,B004Z29WF8,"Atafeh (Nikohl Boosheri) and best friend Shireen (Sarah Kazemy) are typical teenagers, partying and experimenting with alcohol, drugs and sex. The difference is that they live in Tehran where this type of activity is prohibited, especially among women. When Atafeh and Shireen fall in love, they dream of escaping the confines of their culture and forging a bright future together.

Atafeh's brother Mehran (Reza Sixo Safai) who has recently returned from drug re-habilitation is immediately suspicious of the relationship between Atafeh and Shireen. Fuelled by his growing obsession with Shireen, Mehran uses religion to subjugate the women. Atafeh and Shireen's love however, cannot easily be oppressed.

Written and directed by Maryam Keshavarz, Circumstance explores modern Tehran's underground youth scene as well as the danger and persecution that lesbians face in Iran. The film was banned in Iran and Keshavarz has been prohibited from returning there by the Iranian authorities since its release.

Nikohl Boosheri and Sarah Kazemy are wonderfully sexy and believable as two young women falling in love. The chemistry between the women is spot on; the love scenes are hot and steamy as they progress from tentative touching to full-on unstoppable passion.

4505244,4,B004Z29WF8,"I really loved this movie.  I am getting into independent films and this is one of my favorites.  It is not a perfect film.  Some scenes stretch credibility.  Take Mehran's video surveillance of his family.  I find it hard to believe that no one in the family saw the mounted cameras and how did he have the time to go through so much video?  But the video surveillance was important because it brought the surveillance that had previously take place outside of their home into their home and that changes the dynamics of the story.  So if you are willing to suspend disbelief for a moment, it does make an important point in the movie.

Nikohl and Sarah were effective as the two friends, Atafeh and Shireen, turned lovers.  Also, Soheil's Firouz was also effective as the father who tried to keep the religious madness that is Iran outside the doors of the home but eventually because of Mehran's increasing fanaticism and association with the Morality Police succumbs to the religious madness.  Reza does his best to make Mehran a sympathetic character as well as a disturbed one, but it does always work well.  The scene in which he breaks down in tears does not appear to mesh well from the preceding ruthlessness of his manipulation of Shireen's terrifying encounter with the Morality Police into an unwanted marriage with him and the way that he then molds her into a docile wife.  Nasrin's Azar is the most undeveloped main character who does not seem to have a role in the film other than to sing Iranian songs and pretend like everything is OK.

If I have one complaint, it would be that the breakup of Atafeh and Shireen could have been brought about more subtly.  It was inevitable due to the restrictions against homosexuality in Iran (and yes their escape to Dubai was unrealistic).  I appreciate that the director wanted to create a bold statement with the film's tragic ending, but Shireen's uncle putting his foot down and forcing Shireen to marry her unwanted suitor Yusef which then leads Shireen to substitute Mehran for Yusef so that she could stay close to Atafeh could have provided a more realistic ending to their lesbian romance.  The way that Mehran gets Shireen to marry him seems a bit contrived.

With that said, the reason that the ending is so heartbreaking is that Atafeh and Shireen never get a chance to see if their relationship could work.  Maybe under different circumstances they marry or maybe this is nothing more than a brief period of sexual experimentation.  They never get the chance to find out where their love affair could lead.",1350345600,2,2576,4.7225950782997765
4505275,5,B004Z29WF8,"There have been few movies in my lifetime that have had such a profound affect on me as Circumstance.  The movie ended and my heart was heavy. I could not sleep. I would be sick to have to sit at the same table as my brother and parents knowing his wedding night was to the woman I love and imagining what he did to her the night before. The correlations to a third world country and the ""progressive"" United States were absolutely terrifying. Other than not having to fear a political official performing a gynecological exam on me to see if my hymen was still in tact, we are not dissimilar. Gays to this day do not walk hand in hand comfortably on our streets. We do not have the same equalities that heterosexuals enjoy with marriage to protect our property, our children, our work, or when we are sick and cannot visit our partners.  Those considered minorities have such privileges. In some sense, our pets have more regard and more protections than the gay community. We forget that we too have cameras prevalent in our cities and in everyone's hand to ensure that nothing goes unnoticed. We worry about politicians taking Planned Parenthood away from women even today. The discussion of how a woman uses her own body is still in the hands of politicians.  We are not very different at all.  A must see.",1346716800,6,1310,4.538135593220339

The film is phenomenally shot with outstanding cinematography, costume, and set design. The sets and locations were (although not Iran) rich and full of a story all their own. The intersecting lives of the characters, the subtle narrative which was never preachy in an overtly oppressive society is juxtaposed against the timeless story of love and family.

This director, her cast, and crew, all had the courage and strength to orchestrate this film in the face of real adversity to ultimately create something beautiful and truly human.

Congratulations to all in this film and their families for putting themselves on the line to get this made and distributed. This story is universal, relevant, beautiful, and tragic.

4505285,3,B004Z29WF8,"**This review may contain spoilers**

As an American, I try to read about what the Iranian regime is up to every day. It's a scary, dangerous place, that conjures up images of a police state akin to Nazi Germany. Maryam Keshavarz's new film, Circumstance, attempts to reveal the repressive nature of Iranian society by focusing on the relationship between two teenage school girls from Tehran, Atafeh, who lives with her liberal parents and Shireen, raised by an uncle after her dissident parents presumably were murdered by the Mullahs some time after the Iranian Revolution.

Keshavarz spent some time growing up in Iran but it's my understanding that she's been thoroughly ensconced in the USA for quite some time. In interviews, Keshavarz indicates that she based her script on her some of her own experiences as well as the experiences of some her Iranian relatives. Hence, her narrative appears to be written at a distance, with the resulting storyline full of tasty morsels but never quite arriving at the main course.

We do learn about the rebellious, underground youth culture in Iran and there's an interesting scene where Atafeh and Shireen meet up with some friends including an Iranian-American, who conscripts the girls to participate in the dubbing of the American film, 'Milk', into Farsi. It's perhaps the most humorous scene in the entire movie, as the director chastises one of the participants for sounding ""too gay"" on the soundtrack.

Also interesting is the role of the 'morality police', as they seek to crush the spirit of the many rebellious youth, dissatisfied with repressive governmental policies. While Atafeh's brother, Mehran, ends up as an informer for the police, I wanted to know much more about how the group operates. Atafeh and Shireen are saved through Mehran's connections but I shudder to think of what happens to innocent citizens who don't have a family member to bail them out.

There were other scenes which I had no way of confirming were true. For example, Atafeh's father's assertion that he looks forward to the day that women can swim in the ocean. Some posters who claimed to be from Iran asserted that women are not prevented from swimming besides men. There was also a scene where an extremely sexually frustrated cabbie masturbates while fondling one of the girl's feet. Again, it's difficult to know whether this type of behavior is the norm in such a conservative society. One scene that did ring true was the arrest of the Iranian-American film director. At one point, we can hear a TV news broadcast in the background which notes the young man's arrest and that he is an American-Israeli agent (it would seem to me that anyone with joint Iranian-American citizenship would be insanely foolish to return to Iran at this juncture in time).

Keshavarz wastes quite a bit of time by focusing on the illicit lesbian relationship between Atafeh and Shireen. I would have much preferred the director to have limited the erotic contact to a minimum as it feels more like what American teenagers might do than the kind of behavior we would expect from Iranian girls, presumably much more shy and conservative, than their American counterparts.

Keshavarz attempts to humanize Mehran, having him break down after his marriage to Shireen and her negative response to him in the sack. That short hint of vulnerability is enough for Shireen to turn a cold shoulder toward Atafeh and suddenly embrace the backward Mehran. Not sure if I bought that sudden character transformation. The same goes for Atafeh and Mehran's father who rejects religion when we first meet him but then joins Mehran, bowing to Mecca on a prayer shawl at film's end.

While the film makes much of scenes of surveillance footage, connoting the Big Brother mentality in Iranian society, what's missing is a more nuanced portrait of the bad guys. What actually was Mehran and his superior doing at the party where Atafeh and her mother were singing together? I hardly think that those type of fanatics could have sat there and listened to women singing unless of course they were there seeking out additional intelligence.

For a first feature, 'Circumstance' is visually quite impressive. In the end, however, it's a film that's more style over substance. What was needed was more of a hard-hitting expos than the tame domestic drama we end up with, here.",1326758400,3,4373,4.963114754098361
4505286,4,B004Z29WF8,"CIRCUMSTANCE is a brave film from the respected filmmaker Maryam Keshavarz who both wrote and directed this film about contemporary mores and cultural taboos in Iran.  It is a film that dares to create a story about family, the youth culture of clubs and drugs and all night music, about the Morality Police who carefully guard the standards of public  (and private!) behavior, and about same sex liaisons. It is a beautifully photographed study of star-crossed lovers who happen to both be young teenage girls and the manner in which they cope with their love and with the family and world outside the sanctity of their breathtakingly erotic moments together.  Because of the lack of sanctions of the themes of the film which is supposedly set in Tehran the film had to be shot in Lebanon: knowing this adds to the impact of the drama the film so carefully exposes.

Since any public expression of passion is forbidden between Keshavarz's two teenage female protagonists, it brings a whole other level of tension and dread to their shared attraction. Atafeh (Nikohl Boosheri) has the resources and security provided by her wealthy family that allows her to live a double life with her friend and eventual lover, Shireen (Sarah Kazemy). In order to fully explore their feelings, the young women escape into their fantasies of living in a more enlightened land such as Dubai, a haven which is tantamount to Oz. The life of teenage love is difficult enough, but it is even more difficult if that love is between two members of the same sex. Apparently Iran is a country where homosexual relationships can be punishable by death. Atafeh lives in a family of wealth and privilege with her parents (Soheil Parsa and Nasrin Pakkho) and brother, Mehran, (Reza Sixo Safai).  Shireen is not of the same class: she lives with her Aunt and Uncle after being orphaned by her parents who were killed by the government for their immoral ways. Atahfeh and Shireen are two teenage school girls who begin as best friends and gradually discover that they are in love. The girls are also rebellious to Iran's strict religious and socialist ways, being caught up in Tehran's underground nightclub scene. Mehran, a former musician and drug addict, has become a radical Muslim and informant for the Morality Police, installing cameras in every room of his home to spy on his family, capturing all the comings and goings of each member of the household, including the trysts between Ayafeh and Shireen, and devises a plan with the Morality Police to marry Shireen after she and Atafeh are arrested by the morality police for partying at a night club. The young lovers discover the circumstances that force them into lives away from each other and the decisions they make (or are made for them) form the conclusion of this haunting film.

Apparently there is great resentment from many Persian viewers who feel the film does not project the real situation in Tehran or in Iran as a whole. This may be true, but the film is not a documentary: Keshavarz has taken an idea and molded with  certain flavors and spices and delivers this brave little film by introducing the extraordinary beauty of the two leading actresses. The cast is solid and if the script could use some editing or re-sculpting it still delivers a concept about same sex love and the lack of acceptance that seems to be global.  We rarely are able to see Persian films and this one is well worth attention.  It is not meant to be factual: it is a story exotically told - and memorable.

4505287,3,B004Z29WF8,"A ""close, but not quite"" kind of movie. I was completely taken with the two girls and their developing relationship but then more and more external forces came into play; each of which would have been a fine complication but cumulatively mired the film down and it eventually just sort of peters out instead of ending.

Still, it's worth watching; well filmed, well acted, with insights into Iranian society and some very erotic moments.",1326240000,7,437,4.905405405405405

Although the film's box screams ""sex"", there is so much more to this than just two girls getting it on.  Iran has a great deal of conflict between and within generations about what to do with music and singing by women, and this film portrays that complexity beautifully, with a story that is not polemical.  Iran has a rich music culture, both ""traditional"" and ""modern"", and one can begin to see here some of the problems and intersections.

4505292,3,B004Z29WF8,"While well-acted and produced, I felt the story line was somewhat forced and a lot of the characters' lives were left unexplained.  Perhaps this could be attributed to the oppressive government under which the film takes place (people disappear, raids ""just happen"", etc.) but a bit of artistic license would have been appreciated by this viewer to create a better narrative flow.  I felt somewhat taken in because of our cultural inability to accept lesbian sex - this always seems to raise a film's cache unnecessarily.  Likewise, oppressive regimes are nothing new and neither is disenchanted youth under those regimes.  Definitely overrated by previous reviewers in my book - somewhat compelling but not particularly memorable.",1323734400,3,731,5.3304347826086955
4505293,5,B004Z29WF8,"Dear Current Reader,

This movie truly shows the love between two women. These actresses truly show the love between their two characters. This movie is about the freedom to be yourself, to express yourself as an individual. This is truly difficult in Iran today, but especially with the current Iranian girls and boys. It is a message that whereever you live, you have the right to be who you choose to be and who you want to fall in love with.

The story of these two girls, it just carries me away. I'm truly impressed by the story from beginning to end. I agree with my follow reviewer that the film is organized, deep and very sensual.
I love this story.

[SPOILER ALERT]
My only wish was that these two in the end would have been together, I was extremely upset when in the end they didn't end up together.

However, this movie expresses an overall message-that even though it may be difficult to be yourself, you should not let that stop you from being who you are, and who you love.
I loved this movie and I hope that you all check it out.

Sending my love-and to all those who are having trouble coming out or having a hard time being yourself-It gets better! trust me. It took me a long time to come out to my parents, but in the end they accepted me for who I was and I will be forever grateful! I send my love to all of you! <3",1323475200,46,1339,4.21484375
