8326183,2,B00176X76A,This is definately NOT worth the price. Bought expecting high quality filming. Not even close. It looks like the guy filmed it using a home camera . He even lists things written on poster paper. Also is voice I found annoying and could not relax. Would not recommend.,1350000000,6,267,4.583333333333333
