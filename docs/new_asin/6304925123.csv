7879201,3,6304925123,"This is a good episode for two reasons. Since much of it is set on a Romulan warbird, we get to see things from the Romulan perspective for a change. Personalising the enemy is a ploy that is handled very well in ""Face of the Enemy"".
The other reason this episode works so well is the change in Troi's role. Personally, I find the character not very interesting (admittedly, that's mainly the fault of the writers) and Marina Sirtis' acting range rather limited. But Troi/Sirtis does a good job here, playing up to her role as a member of the much-feared Tal Shiar for all she's worth. Watching her terrify those around her as a means of concealing her own fear is good TV - and it's even better TV when her Romulan captor/helper is forced to realise he's created a monster.
I don't buy the concept that more secret missions like that Troi is engaged in can proceed as a result of her efforts. But that's not so important. ""Face of the Enemy"" is an enjoyable, though-provoking episode, in which you see one of the usual suspects acting wildly out of character - and doing it surprisingly well.",1030838400,,1093,4.49748743718593
7879202,4,6304925123,"I've never been fond of Picard's ""left hand"", Counselor Deanna Troi, nor am I a big fan of the Romulans.  While the former is played by a barely adequate actress who's trying to play a cardboard character, the  latter has a ton of potential but it is potential not yet realized.  This  fine episode succeeds because it finally makes both Troi and the Romulans  interesting.
Troi is kidnapped in a complex plot by jaded Romulans who,  with the aid of the Federation, are trying to help a few prominent Romulan  politicians defect to the Federation.  This would be a huge political  victory for the Federation and a big blow to the Romulan Empire.  Troi is  forced to play the role of a Romulan intelligence officer on a Romulan  warship.  The story is intense as Troi clashes with the commander of the  Romulan ship and she (Troi) is almost exposed as a fraud on several  occasions (seems she was kidnapped for her empathic abilities and not her  knowledge of Romulans--which is almost nil).
Marina Sirtis, who plays  Deanna Troi, comes across as a very capable actress here and I come to the  conclusion that she would have been better served by the creators and  writers of TNG if they had fleshed out Troi more.  Troi's inabilities are  not the fault of Sirtis, at least so it seems here.
This is a strong  episode and, at the time, was both my favorite Troi episode AND my favorite  Romulan episode.  Pretty cool, eh?",962841600,2,1420,4.588
7879203,5,6304925123,"As always, plots involving Romulans seem to turn on points of honor as well as action and treachery:  FACE OF THE ENEMY has all of them.
A human defects -back- from the Romulan Star Empire at the behest of Ambassador  Spock, with word that Vice Proconsul M'ret wishes to defect.  A victory?  Perhaps:  but Counselor Deanna Troy has been kidnapped by Spock's Romulan  insurgency and modified to resemble a Tal Shiar operative (murdered for the  occasion) and placed on board the KHAZARA, commanded by Toreth, another  Romulan commander with a grudge against the people who killed her father  for treason.
In a twisty plot during which Troi's Betazoid empathy makes  her put on an imitation of an unscrupulous Romulan that is too good to be  comfortable, Spock takes another step toward Unification via ""cowboy  diplomacy"" and STAR TREK creates the inside of a Romulan warbird and  its crew's customs.
Superbly economical worldbuilding.  And,  incidentally, superb research material if you happen to be writing a book  on Romulans.",959126400,7,1029,5.07185628742515
