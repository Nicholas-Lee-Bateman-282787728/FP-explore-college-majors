The textual information which you can switch on and off is a good solution, as you want to know what monsters live 20 Eiffel Towers underneath the surface of the ocean, but gives you the choice just to enjoy the creatures without the info later on.

Image quality and 3D effect are fantastic. Picture is razor sharp as are the teeth of these creatures. Sound quality is very good as well, as is the background music itself. Well, the latter of course depends on your taste. Yes, it is, like the flow of the fish, repeating, but it gives the right ambiance (although I'm sure you won't hear such sounds in deep sea).

A sleeping pill? Even nicer if it works that way for you. Cheap and without the side effects of the chemical pills. On the other hand I can imagine there are others who can use this blu-ray to stay awake as they don't dare to sleep after seeing the Hairy Angler. Imagine that you'll dream about this monster coming as close at you as on this blu-ray!

I was very impressed by this 3D blu-ray, which gives me an aquarium at home with very special fish and the advantage that it is a virtual one. I saw it on my Sony 3D HMD and I, of course, recommend seeing these sometimes funny, sometimes creepy, but always interesting creatures in 3D.

Lets hope there will be more special 3D productions of this quality available soon.

8422937,3,B004CDSTKY,"3-D is pretty good.  Movie (DVD) is s-l-o-w.  Not great.  Only bought because it was cheap(er than usual), but seller (shipper) was FAST, great.  Thanks.  Happy Holiday!",1323907200,,169,5.111111111111111

8422939,3,B004CDSTKY,"The product was delivered as promised by the vendor. However, the product itself makes a good screen saver but it is not entertainment. It is boring and if you do not have a 3D tv, you'll be wasting your money as 3D is the only good thing about this movie. You watch the same marine life over and over and over until you hit the stop button or fall asleep.",1309996800,5,356,4.1
