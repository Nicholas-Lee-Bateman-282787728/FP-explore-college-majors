2983547,1,B000WMA6F0,This movie is terrible! The acting is soooo bad!!! The dialogue is even worse!!! Storyline virtually non-existent. Couldn't stand to watch it for more that 5 minutes. Do yourself a favor & don't waste your hard earned money. Should have waited until someone had reviewed it before buying it. It is an insult to just about every other Christmas movie ever made.

2983558,2,B000WMA6F0,"I really enjoy Christmas movies, but the acting of the female lead is stiff, amateur and doesn't feel natural.  She girlishly giggles incessantly at everything and has a whiny voice that grates.  She's not believable as someone who wants to be a leader in any business because she wouldn't behave this way.

It's obvious the writers of this movie have no idea of what efficiency and productivity really mean and use cliche business lingo to make it seem like the characters know what they're doing.

The only bright light in the movie is Ali Liebert.  She should have had the lead to make this movie more enjoyable.",1419292800,,615,4.710280373831775
2983559,5,B000WMA6F0,I saw this movie on television and wanted it.,1418601600,,45,4.111111111111111
2983560,5,B000WMA6F0,"This movie seems to divide viewers a lot.  I loved it.  I thought the three main characters did very well -- yes, they seemed to be happy most of the time, even when things were going badly-- but then they were trying to make the best of a bad situation.  I certainly liked their acting and, as for the rest of them, some were pretty ""reserved"" in their acting, but then their characters were mostly business people and they were business-like.
  Now for the stuff I really liked:  Noelle Dunn lives in a Christmas town, one that has a factory that makes Christmas decorations.  The town loves Christmas despite the fact that they work at Christmas year round.  The decorations are beautiful and there's a lot of different scenes that show them.  I suppose you could complain because it was obviously NOT filmed during the Christmas season (the trees are in full leaf!) but that's true of many of the Christmas movies.  A higher budget could have CG'd them out, but frankly, I didn't really care that much.  And I really liked looking at the ladies and listening to most of the music.
  I liked the storyline -- people who love Christmas don't rub me the wrong way -- and the complications of the factory (losing money and in debt) make for a nice story.  Or so I thought.
  I've liked this movie since I first saw it 7 years ago and I watch it every year. I suppose I like Christmas a little too much, but for me it just kinda works.",1416787200,3,1434,4.395437262357414

2983563,5,B000WMA6F0,"This 2006 film story follows a young accountant (the beautiful Monica Keena ""Dawson's Creek"") as she tries to save a toy factory where she works from being closed down, while also pursuing a romance with the mysterious new factory worker who comes to her small town. Plenty of beautiful young women, handsome young men, fun and frolics abound. Tis a good holiday escape movie.",1397088000,,376,4.890625

2983571,3,B000WMA6F0,"I don't know which barren landscape I'd least want to get stranded in: the Gobi desert or the Lifetime channel. Given, maybe I'd just had the most awful luck in that each time I flipped to Lifetime, there'd be crap on my telly. Seems to me, for every good programming like An Amish Murder (2013) or Still Small Voices (2007), there'd be ten specimens of awfulness like All She Wants for Christmas (2006).

Er, here's the plot of it: In Forest City, a town of which survival depends primarily on the local Christmas decorations factory, the city limits marker boasts that ""We're Merry All Year Long."" It's one of those communities that were it to exist in real life may come off as kinda creepy; it seems so fixated on Christmas (although, a rebuttal may be that this story does take place around the holidays; maybe, the rest of the time, they're as grouchy and mean-spirited as you and me). But it's stopped snowing in Forest City years ago. Maybe that's an omen, maybe it's just global warming.

My uh-oh radar activated when the central character, Judith Ann Dunn (Monica Keena), remarks that everyone calls her ""Noelle"" because she was born in December. That just smacked of trying too hard to be cute. Noelle is a practical girl. She's into progress and the bottom line. She's an economics whiz who's raring to take Wall Street by storm. But she thinks she can pad her resume some if only she can figure out a way for the Aikens Christmas Decorations Co. to regain solvency. It'll be tough since the old founder, him what just passed away, had been subsidizing the company's losses with money from his personal account.

But how does that mysterious drifter (Tobias Mehler) what just drove into town - and immediately had Noelle's giant snowman balloon collapse on him - figure into things? He gets a temp gig as a seasonal employee at Aiken's. And check him out getting all chummy with the founder's foxy granddaughter (Sonya Salomaa) who's just pulled into town to assess the company. It doesn't take a veteran of television programming to identify all the clich&eacute;d plot points.

If you haven't figured things out yet by the first two commercial breaks, honestly, I'm judging you. There's a big reveal mid-film that's anything but. The one thing that did make me go ""Huh, how about that?"" was how the impending mega-store incursion would figure into it. Global Mart threatens the town's small businesses. Half of the community is up in arms, the rest are scrambling to show their support of Global Mart (and hoping to nail some jobs). My favorite character is neither the whiz accountant or the mysterious drifter. I thought Nelson Wong's crusty Kenny the diner owner stole every scene he was in. My biggest problem isn't the triteness or the obviousness of the plot or the uninspired dialogue. It's the performances of the two leads. Keena and Mehler show minimum spark and demonstrate the least natural acting performances. Mehler just seems to float thru his lines. Monica Keena, I don't what it is about her. Maybe it's that she giggles too much. It's awkward. It's contrived. And that dart throwing at the dollar bar is plenty ridiculous. 2.5 out of 5 stars for this one. Boy, Lifetime's got me grumpy today. I'll be needing my special eggnog.",1386547200,,3261,4.766371681415929
2983572,1,B000WMA6F0,Seriously one of the worst movies ever. Horrible acting plus the main couples knows each other for a few days and she becomes a crazy stalking girlfriend and keeps getting mad over nothing. Don't waste your life watching this movie.,1385856000,,232,4.825
2983573,5,B000WMA6F0,"Monica Keena at her best in a romantic comedy, holiday movie. She is cute as always, and the cast around her shines too. One more family movie to watch at Christmas time!",1384819200,5,170,4.34375
2983574,5,B000WMA6F0,Real great family movie.  My wife loved them all.  I have no regrets on the purchase of that movies bought at the same time as others.,1377043200,,134,4.115384615384615

2983576,4,B000WMA6F0,I really enjoyed this movie.  I watch many Christmas films and most have the same concept but this one takes a different approach.  It is very enjoyable.,1359936000,,153,4.62962962962963
2983577,2,B000WMA6F0,I love this movie!!!I bought the movie and have watched it several times. You should see it! Love the scenery. Great Christmas romantic comedy movie  Great additiond to my Christmas movies collecetion,1359590400,4,200,5.25

2983580,1,B000WMA6F0,"I am angry at myself for wasting an hour and half of the holiday season and spending the money on this terrible film.  Bad acting, bad plot.  The only redeeming aspect of the film was the handsome lead actor, but that did not make up for all the other negatives of this film.  And I am someone who LOVES Christmas movies.......",1294531200,3,327,4.327868852459017
2983596,1,B000WMA6F0,"ugh.  couldn't take it.  just terrible.  plus, the main character(as seen on the HBO show Entourage) is so terribly miscast.  She is an atrocious actress, too short and stubby to be cute or interesting, and her english is not mature enough to be believable as a ""business-woman.""  Not to mention the fact that she wears skin-tight ripped jeans in most of the movie.  I LOVE Christmas movies, but this one is a REAL STINKER!

don't waste your time.  Lifetime and Hallmark both have some great Christmas movies, this one does not make my repeat-viewing list....

I urge Hollywood, do not hire that actress again, MAYBE as a some sort of carnival-dwarf or an extra at a fat-camp.

oh, there is a scene with really strange singing in the warehouse and they are dancing around with their carts, for 'camp-value,' it is worth buying the dvd and posting it on the internet!  It's such an absurd scene!!!  It makes you feel really uncomfortable and embarrassed for all those in it!!!",1289260800,,975,4.704142011834319
2983597,2,B000WMA6F0,"All She Wants for Christmas is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it could be a close second. Seemingly amateur acting does not overcome a weak but cheerful script. In essence, it is an only marginally entertaining Christmas film. There are no surprises for a film of this genre. There are much better out there worth your time and money.",1286755200,3,343,4.548387096774194
2983598,4,B000WMA6F0,"I enjoyed this movie, although fairly predictable in storyline. It follows a typical single girl meets single guy routine, but with some twists and turns along the way. I've always appreciated these kinds of movies where you know you can sit down and watch without worrying about whether the movie will be family friendly. My favorite aspect of this movie is the way the whole town comes together to enjoy Christmas and the holidays. A charming movie for the whole family.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-She-Wants-for-Christmas/dp/B000WMA6F0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All She Wants for Christmas</a>",1285632000,11,648,6.375

2983602,4,B000WMA6F0,"Maybe I have bad taste or something, but I actually enjoyed this movie (albeit, only as a guilty pleasure), and was surprised to see all the one-star reviews.  This is your typical made-for-tv / lifetime-original-movie fare, and if you go into it knowing what to expect, it's an enjoyable ride.  Sure, it's corny, patronizing, and full of hammy acting from no-name actors, but it's a sweet and simple movie that captures the spirit of the season pretty well...and that's what I expect from this type of feature.  After watching Lifetime Network's Christmas specials for the past few weeks, this one actually stands out as one of the better efforts.",1229558400,30,648,4.926605504587156
2983603,3,B000WMA6F0,"I'm a sucker for Christmas movies in general. I will agree with the others here in that the acting was terrible, at least the main female character was played by a terrible actress (who is she? I don't recognize her from anything else), the rest of the cast did an OK job. Even so, I still enjoyed the sweet story line.

3218073,4,B000WMA6F0,I really enjoyed this movie.  I watch many Christmas films and most have the same concept but this one takes a different approach.  It is very enjoyable.,1359936000,,153,4.62962962962963

3218075,5,B000WMA6F0,This is a good movie. I watch it every year. Its a special movie with great insight in lifes everyday issues. My friend had got this one for me from amazon.com,1353110400,,159,4.161290322580645
3218076,4,B000WMA6F0,It is a cornball movie and has cheesy dialogue - but it is a definite feel good movie - just relax and don't think so hard!,1294790400,,123,3.769230769230769
3218077,1,B000WMA6F0,"I am angry at myself for wasting an hour and half of the holiday season and spending the money on this terrible film.  Bad acting, bad plot.  The only redeeming aspect of the film was the handsome lead actor, but that did not make up for all the other negatives of this film.  And I am someone who LOVES Christmas movies.......",1294531200,3,327,4.327868852459017
3218093,1,B000WMA6F0,"ugh.  couldn't take it.  just terrible.  plus, the main character(as seen on the HBO show Entourage) is so terribly miscast.  She is an atrocious actress, too short and stubby to be cute or interesting, and her english is not mature enough to be believable as a ""business-woman.""  Not to mention the fact that she wears skin-tight ripped jeans in most of the movie.  I LOVE Christmas movies, but this one is a REAL STINKER!

don't waste your time.  Lifetime and Hallmark both have some great Christmas movies, this one does not make my repeat-viewing list....

I urge Hollywood, do not hire that actress again, MAYBE as a some sort of carnival-dwarf or an extra at a fat-camp.

oh, there is a scene with really strange singing in the warehouse and they are dancing around with their carts, for 'camp-value,' it is worth buying the dvd and posting it on the internet!  It's such an absurd scene!!!  It makes you feel really uncomfortable and embarrassed for all those in it!!!",1289260800,,975,4.704142011834319
3218094,2,B000WMA6F0,"All She Wants for Christmas is not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it could be a close second. Seemingly amateur acting does not overcome a weak but cheerful script. In essence, it is an only marginally entertaining Christmas film. There are no surprises for a film of this genre. There are much better out there worth your time and money.",1286755200,3,343,4.548387096774194
3218095,4,B000WMA6F0,"I enjoyed this movie, although fairly predictable in storyline. It follows a typical single girl meets single guy routine, but with some twists and turns along the way. I've always appreciated these kinds of movies where you know you can sit down and watch without worrying about whether the movie will be family friendly. My favorite aspect of this movie is the way the whole town comes together to enjoy Christmas and the holidays. A charming movie for the whole family.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/All-She-Wants-for-Christmas/dp/B000WMA6F0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">All She Wants for Christmas</a>",1285632000,11,648,6.375

3218099,4,B000WMA6F0,"Maybe I have bad taste or something, but I actually enjoyed this movie (albeit, only as a guilty pleasure), and was surprised to see all the one-star reviews.  This is your typical made-for-tv / lifetime-original-movie fare, and if you go into it knowing what to expect, it's an enjoyable ride.  Sure, it's corny, patronizing, and full of hammy acting from no-name actors, but it's a sweet and simple movie that captures the spirit of the season pretty well...and that's what I expect from this type of feature.  After watching Lifetime Network's Christmas specials for the past few weeks, this one actually stands out as one of the better efforts.",1229558400,30,648,4.926605504587156
3218100,3,B000WMA6F0,"I'm a sucker for Christmas movies in general. I will agree with the others here in that the acting was terrible, at least the main female character was played by a terrible actress (who is she? I don't recognize her from anything else), the rest of the cast did an OK job. Even so, I still enjoyed the sweet story line. And all and all, for a Christmas TV movie, it's not the worst I've seen.",1229299200,6,392,4.171052631578948

8223759,3,B000WMA6F0,Films are made by casting and Monica Keena is miscast in this christmas movie.  She sounds like a Valley Girl and not a business woman.  She also looks terrible.  She looks 15-20 years older than her actual age.  In this film she plays a girl trying to save her town.  This film would have been better if they cast anybody else.  Since this a Tv-Movie it goes by the numbers.  However it has been 12 years and they could just re-work the screenplay and make it again and MAKE IT BETTER,1522800000,,485,4.263736263736264
