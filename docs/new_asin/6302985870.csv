This was a good movie but, I didn't care to much for the way it

ended.  This movie showed how a black man can get caught up in

the everyday struggles of life, and began to take it out on the one

who's closest to him and who has his back when times get hard, this

woman was always on the supporting end, never gave up on him through

his struggles with prejudice white folk.  I was glad he was on the

way to getting his life in order.  Good ole movie I'd say.

Wished there was a part 2 to this movie, I would definately buy it.

527494,5,6302985870,"In 1964, when ""Nothing But a Man"" was released, it must have been a shock to see a film that presents a story focused on the lives of black characters, and does so with such vivid and unsparing authenticity. The film's power has faded little in over forty years and remains essential viewing for reasons that far exceed its historical importance. The story of a man who refuses to conform or give in but who breaks a little along the way as he ends up fighting everyone around him is told with such courage and honesty that you are hooked from the opening scenes. The direction is unobtrusive and the script manages to effectively walk the delicate balance between delivering a message without being heavy-handed. The actors in the film don't seem to have a lot of range but what they do, they do very effectively and are completely convincing.

I end up watching this film about once a decade (I've seen it three times). On both occasions as I anticipated watching it again I've thought it's not going to be as good as I remember it being. I've been wrong both times, rediscovering the film's force and seeing even more layers of subtlety as I watched it through the filter of my added experience. I can't recommend this film highly enough.",1175212800,12,1241,4.59009009009009

527496,5,6302985870,"Once you see this film you won't forget this! Low budget, but excellent and compelling story of a Black man (Ivan Dixon-best remembered as ""Kinch"" of ""Hogan's Heroes"") in the South who faces classism (he is a poor man who wants to marry a middle-class preacer's daughter played by Abbey Lincoln) as well as racism. When the local whites see that Dixon refuses to pay the ""Uncle Tom game,"" the word gets out and he becomes unhirable.

This film examines a lot of issues in between all this, but I will spare all that for the viewer. You really have to see it. Lots of good atmospheric touches that makes the Southern urban ghetto scenery authentic, as well as the R&B and Gospel soundtrack.

527499,5,6302985870,"Here's an American neo-realist masterwork that captures the temper of  black consciousness in the south just prior to the mass upheavals of the  early '60s.
Long before Scorsese made ""Mean Streets"" and  ""Raging Bull,"" Michael Roemer had made this great film. No other  film dramatizes so profoundly the plight of a man whose basic human pride  will not be compromised under any circumstances.
Ivan Dixon as Duff  gives one of the greatest performances in the history of cinema and Abbey  Lincoln as Josie, the preacher's daughter he tries to settle down with, is  just about perfect in control of nuance. These characters are extraordinary  ""ordinary"" people, truly heroic; yet the tragedy that stalks them  may or may not be hopeless at this time in history, due to an apparent  shift in black consciousness, a general ""fed-up-with-it-all""  attitude that needs men like Duff to inspire itself.
The entire cast is  uniformly excellent and there are too many brilliant scenes to mention  here. The film seems cut directly from the fabric of real life in a  semi-documentary Rossellini-like style. ""Little Fugitive"" and  ""Medium Cool"" are the only other pre-70s American films I've seen  that feel this real and authentic.
In terms of the subtlety with which  racial politics and power relations are exposed through simple gestures and  concrete acts rather than rhetoric and melodrama, Martin Ritt's  ""Sounder"" and Paul Schrader's ""Blue Collar"" are the  only films I've seen that come close. Charles Burnett's low-budget  independent masterpiece ""Killer of Sheep,"" also comes to mind.
There are a lot of lessons to be learned here, especially by directors  like Spike Lee, who I'm sure has seen this movie, and who has made decent  films in the past (Do the Right Thing, She's gotta have it), but now wastes  his time making laughable, ""really hardcore,"" ""I want to  transcend puny barriers with overloads of style"" cartoons like  ""Summer of Sam."" ""Nothing but a Man"" is light years  away from the two-dimensional nonsense they call ""realism"" these  days. Over and out",969235200,54,2067,5.086567164179105

527577,5,6302985870,"I grew up in racist segregated Florida so I can totally identify with this little film and the Uppity Negro portrayed by Ivan Dixon. The story set in 1964 is simple and true and all the actors (black & white) manage to keep it real. Though the action centers around race relations in the south ""Nothing But A Man"" also deals with economics, family, relationships, and abandonment which only add to the universal appeal this Venice Film Festival winner has enjoyed for the past 50 years.

The Motown soundtrack keeps movie moving and grooving.

EXTRAS include heartfelt interviews with actors Ivan Dixon, Abby Lincoln, and Julius Harris 40 years later (2004). A dialog between writer/producer/director Michael Roemer and writer/producer/cameraman Robert Young would have been great if Roemer would have only shut up for a minute and let Young get a word in edgewise. Roemer kept butting in and was so annoying I finally gave up and signed off.

527581,5,6302985870,"...was to turn down the lead in this movie. The role was offered to him, according to its creators in the featurettes, although they don't account for his refusal. It may have been the $15,000 total budget, despite which it is still arguably the best film from the Civil Rights era -- since this one mercifully spares its viewers the melodrama of, say, 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?' (1967) and its hero's shiny armour.

'Nothing But a Man' features a terse, unsentimental script that hits its mark today as much as in 1964, despite how often such issues have been treated since. Its focus on inward tensions, and its adroit ways of handling them, place it a cut above most race relations fare, which has so frequently reached for grand gestures and fictive heroics.

The actors, mostly unknown, are all beyond reproach. Remarkably, all except Dixon and Gloria Foster were amateurs; rehearsals wangled the rest. Ivan Dixon, in the lead as Duff, went on to some fame in Hogan's Heroes, during the tokenistic `60s - yet this is his big achievement. What saves 'In the Heat of the Night' ('67) from clich is that Poitier's character would irritate a saint, and the counterpart saving grace here is Duff's taciturn pride. It makes for a volatile mix when the local racists come taunting, but instead of any Hollywood grandiosity what artfully comes into play is the complexity of Duff's character.

Without giving away too much, he and his co-workers cover the spectrum between holding back seething anger and pandering more or less covertly to racist pressures. Duff's wife, played by Abbey Lincoln, gives a searing but graceful performance as someone firm in her loyalty, sympathetic to her man's rage, yet, in her way, also proud. As Josie, Lincoln delivers an unassuming, completely unselfconscious yet totally believable performance as a woman with an inner emotional life. It should not surprise that, with her roots as a respected jazzy singer, Lincoln the neophyte actress is able to evoke deep feeling through mundane, simple mannerisms. She manages this even with her teasing response to Duff's inquiry about the men she had kissed.

Despite her preacher father's disapproval, the grounds for Josie's feelings for Duff, as far as the script allows, are about how the men she dated were ""...kind of sad."" And when Duff's pride takes him past her reach, even to the point of violence towards her, the script gives her character even fewer cues.

Still, Lincoln strikes an astonishing chemistry with Dixon: it is always shown, never told, it lacks corniness, and, despite even spousal violence, it is always convincing. The danger for Duff is that his father's sins may be visited on himself. Josie, along with their child, remains his single hope on his return after burying his father.

In lesser hands, her role might have added too little, and thrown the movie off its fragile kilter. More bluntly: she saves it from gaps in the script. Although Duff himself is hardly loquacious, imagine her first reading through the script, seeing the line about her previous guys being ""...kind of sad."" Slim pickings, by any measure. Yet she carries it off well, leaving amidst her disappointment an obscure undertow of something half grasped about her character. It is a travesty that such a talented and unusually beautiful woman was never groomed for a movie career. Especially given this movie's themes, only a fool would fail to consider if race, and her famed activism, were factors in this neglect.

Hand-held camera may be undergoing a renewed vogue, but it was small flicks such as 'Nothing But a Man' that put this verit technique to best use. Several scenes gain much impact from the camera work, including a candid, near-rude close-up exploration of a prostitute's face at the juke joint where Duff drinks with his pals; this scene, among others, retains its power to shock. Another at a church captures vividly the underprivileged south of the early `60s, and is refreshing also for its ordinary women singing with passion yet unremarkably. The effective use of direct sound in that scene is also adopted to great effect in one of the most remarkable segments of `Nothing But a Man': Duff's visit to his father.

The latter is played with chilling mastery by Julius Harris, an (amateur!) actor who had once worked as a male orderly. His hospital experience helped shape his chilling portrayal of a broken-down alcoholic with an unfocused stare, a convincingly defeated air, and a crippled arm that is left to dangle for a brief spell with astonishing veracity. The documentary approach used for this visit, where we also meet his hardened companion Lee (Gloria Foster), makes for stark cinema of a kind seldom dared to this day. Even the way he clutches his sallow-faced gal's breast during his final moments adds richly to Harris's stellar performance.

The featurettes, assembled in a '40 Years Later...' framework, are workmanlike but recommended. They include interviews with the three leads; a very worthy, informative, ego-less chat between the creative lead team of Michael Roemer and Robert M. Young; and an overview of Lincoln's career (Note a photo of Thelonious Monk on her piano. She was also married to ber drummer Max Roach, attesting further to her fine taste and the leading edge she inhabited).

The musical soundtrack is from Motown Records. It includes soul and r&b classics by 'Little Stevie' Wonder, Martha & The Vandellas (Heat Wave), The Miracles (You've Really Got A Hold On Me), Holland & Dozier, The Marvelettes and Mary Wells (You Beat Me to the Punch; Bye Bye Baby). But, again, its makers did not abide having it piped in cleanly; it appears only in verit snatches, near-randomly and through radios, jukeboxes, etc. The closed captions would not work for me.

As cinema, this definitely shows its age in the best possible ways - including by the use of the best documentary forms. When Duff walks through slums, that is what you see. The squalid life of poor southern blacks is not left to actors: locals were asked not to look at the camera, and most succeed. Those who made 'Nothing But a Man' must also be credited for being unflinching - such as when we witness, from very up close, the brutal conditions in which both the lead's natural son and his father live. But the highest accolade is the film's report about the man embroiled in his predicament: it includes not a moment that seems dated, contrived or implausible.

An outstanding movie.",1375315200,3,6486,4.924062214089662
527582,5,6302985870,I loved the story line.  I was real and reminded me of growing up and talking to my Grandmothers about how things were when they were younger..,1371513600,2,143,4.296296296296297
527603,5,6302985870,"There are film buffs. There are history buffs. There are sociology buffs. This is the type of film that should appeal to all three.

The story is really very simple. Boy meets girl. There have been countless variations of the same story for thousands of years. What makes this one unique is how the boy meeting and getting the girl is very much at the mercy of the world around them. Not so much in the openly disapproving way popularized by ""Romeo and Juliet"", but in more sinster ways. From the inside.

Aside from some stern but supportive disapproval from the girl's father, there really isn't much in the way of opposition to the relationship between Josie (Abbey Lincoln) and Duff (Ivan Dixon). At their wedding, no one stands to object. The most Duff's friends can muster up are jokes about what could've addled Duff enough for him to finally settle down.

Yet, their relationship is threatened.

The acting is restrained, yet powerful. Duff is a proud man who falls for Josie, but settling down entails leaving his secure job on the railroad and staying in one place. Duff's next-door neighbor is a man who seems to do nothing but sit miserably on his porch, indifferent to his wife's nagging. Duff's white coworkers condescend to him with impunity, calling him ""boy"" and making suggestive remarks about Josie. Duff's black coworkers are too afraid to say anything back. Everywhere he goes, the atmosphere is filled with tension. The tension is there when Josie's father bemoans about how difficult it is to talk to white people in the midst of the changing times, not knowing how to appease them in such uncertain conditions. The tension is there when some white men decide Duff is acting too ""uppity"" and go out of their way to intimidate him at his job. The tension is there when Duff's bosses become antagonistic at the very mention of their workers possibly unionizing.

This tension spills over into Duff's and Josie's marriage. As the tension placed on Duff's shoulders increases, he increasingly uses Josie as his outlet for his frustrations. What would be a portrait of a struggling marriage is given broader sociological context not only by Duff's neighbor, but by his father and by his son from a prior relationship. In a ghetto of Birmingham that, disturbingly enough, looks little different from the ghettoes of today, Duff has essentially abandoned his son with a woman who is already taking care of at least three other children. There is no man around. Where is Duff's father? At home drinking, bemoaning the loss of his arm to a saw mill accident and mistreating the woman he's with.

The film has aged well not only because of its well-written story, the actors all giving their absolute best, and the realistic approach to African-American life in the '60s. It has aged well because of its central theme of how societal prejudice and discrimination tears communities and families apart not only by overt acts of violence, but by coursing covertly through the daily lives of those it affects with the only outlet being inward. When reacting against the forces of oppression is confronted with insurmountable obstacles and impossible odds, the only option left is for the oppressed to destroy themselves. It is a tragic commentary on why almost fifty years after this was filmed, black communities across America are still facing this monster of internalized oppression even as external oppression has lessened.

It is a very beautiful film, and probably the truest glimpse of black life in the '60s.",1361059200,2,3525,4.894472361809045

527605,5,6302985870,"Nothing But A Man was released in 1964, directed and written by Michael Roemer, a Jewish man who fled Germany after the night of broken glass, which took place in 1938 and was called Kristallnacht, just as the Jews were getting set up to be killed.  He was a director ahead of his time, producing and writing a movie about the Black experience in the United States prior to the Civil Rights Acts.

The movie focused on a Black couple, Duff, played by Ivan Dixon, and Josie, played by jazz vocalist Abbey Lincoln.  Nothing But A Man is a movie about the relentless oppression of Blacks by Whites in the 50s and early 60s in the United States, whether it is in the North or the South.

Most of the movie takes place in the South.  Duff meets Josie at a church dinner, previous to which he stands in the doorway of the church during the service yet he never enters the church.  Duff cruises through Black society, working as a rail hand making $80 a week, which was 4 times what the Black men were making who lived in the Southern town.

Little by little Duffs personality emerges as he encounters White racism over and over again.  Ironically, Jews played most of the racists.  This is a powerful movie, realistically showing Blacks and Whites as they were back then.  There were no stereotypical players; it was life as it was.

Duff travels out of town to visit his son, who he rarely sees; on this trip, he runs into his father.  Just like Duff and his son, Duff and his father are estranged.

As they made the film, life seemed to interfere.  Every night the Jewish filmmakers and the Blacks went their separate ways.  The film was shot in Cape May, New Jersey during the summer of 1963 when President Kennedy went on national TV to announce his civil rights bill was going before Congress.

On the night following the presidents address, Medgar Evers was shot and killed near his home in Jackson, Mississippi.  At that time he was the field secretary of the NAACP.

There was constant conflict between the Jewish directors and the Black actors.  On the first day of shooting the film, Michael Roemer asked Ivan Dixon to shave off his mustache.  Ivan was furious and showed Roemer pictures of Jesse Jackson, Malcolm X, Martin Luther King and showed that they all wore mustaches.  Roemer relented reluctantly.

Just as the movie was about racial relations, the filming of it dealt with racial relations in a parallel manner.  One serious fight between Roemer and Dixon took place when Ivan Dixon decided to take off during the shooting to take his place in the March On Washington.  The film makers, worrying about the budget, failed to see the importance of the historical events that were taking place during the making of the film.

Ivan Dixon and Rubin, one of the filmmakers, actually came to blows.  Dixon knocked Rubin unconscious.  After this serious altercation, the actors and film makers came to terms and the movie continued.

During the filming, near the end of the action, a church in Birmingham was bombed and four children were killed.  Abbey Lincoln flew into a fury.  Despite the ongoing conflicts, the movie was finished and Abbey Lincoln won a best actress award in Dakar at the World Festival of African Arts for her part in the film.  Poet Langston Hughes delivered the award to her.

The Nation of Islam newspaper called Mohammed Speaks said of the movie that it was a you must see, don't dare miss movie . . . a blood and guts movie of Black life as it is, without apology and the movie was directed by a white director who didn't think whites should make Black films.

Nothing But A Man is a gripping film and, if it were released today to general theatres, would be a big hit.  Its difficult to believe that just 60 years ago, we were so primitive in our treatment of Blacks in the United States.  Actually, when one thinks about it, the horror continues in todays life.
 Ivan Dixon, who played Duff, starred in Porgy and Bess and A Raisin in the Sun.  Stevie Wonder, Mary Wells, Martha and The Vandellas, The Miracles, and the Marvelettes bring the soundtrack to life.

This movie can be purchased on Amazon and is a must see.  It should be shown in public schools, in history classes, all across the country.  Ebony Magazine called it One of the TOP 10 Black Films of all time.",1358726400,3,4306,4.555989583333333
527606,5,6302985870,"What a genuine find this obscure 1964 film is. In the midst of Sidney Poitier's breakthrough as a mainstream leading man of the big studios, director Michael Roemer made a groundbreaking independent film that fully captured the black experience at the dawn of the civil rights movement without exploiting the controversial subject or introducing a non-threatening component that would have made the story more palatable for white audiences. The latter was especially the case in Poitier's biggest movies at the time like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lilies-of-the-Field/dp/B000IZZRSC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lilies of the Field</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Guess-Who-s-Coming-To-Dinner/dp/B008Y704R0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Guess Who's Coming To Dinner</a>&nbsp;where he played variations on the over-idealized black man, a point made ironic by the fact that the legendary actor turned down the lead role in this film. In a perceptive screenplay co-written by Roemer and Robert M. Young, the protagonist, Duff Anderson, is anything but idealized. He is a laborer who suffers as much from his own self-loathing as he does from the deeply ingrained racism surrounding him.

In early 1960's Birmingham, Alabama, Duff is an itinerant worker, a member of a section team for the railroad company. At a church social one evening, he meets Josie Dawson, a well-educated schoolteacher who happens to be the minister's daughter. In spite of her father's disapproval, the two quietly fall in love and get married. They face one hardship after another as he tries to find stable work while dealing with a troubled past which includes an estranged, embittered father whose life he appears to be emulating against his will. Duff also supports a four-year-old son whom he hasn't seen for two years even though he's not certain he's the father. While racism is presented honestly and produces moments of genuine dramatic tension, it never becomes a manipulative device to move the plot forward. Things begin to unravel between Duff and Josie through the course of the story but not with excessive melodramatic flourishes. In fact, the film is so truthfully matter-of-fact in Roemer's documentary-like approach that when Duff has an explosive moment late in the story it feels shocking but utterly real.

The performances completely surprised me.

This is one of the few movies that accurately depicts the African American experience during the early 1960's. I can't imagine it would have been shown in the South...and it may not have attracted many white audiences in the North.  A Black railroad worker falls in love with a preacher's daughter and decides to settle down.  He is a flawed man, but with goodness and pride. Earlier he had gotten a woman pregnant and casually abandoned his young son...a pattern quite similar to his alcoholic father who did the same thing to him.  Taking the plunge, he has a chance for a new life with a good woman...but what distinguishes him are two things: First, he will not swallow his pride when he is disrespected by white bosses or others, and second, he will not solve the problem easily by just going North.  Most of the time, he is either fired or walks away from a job. He is not belligerent, but he will not bend his head like a dog. In essence, he won't prejudice his basic dignity.

My word, how much drama there is in a scene where a white man calls him ""boy"", and he asks to be called by his real name, simply but firmly.  There are no histrionics in the film...nothing but a man.

This was Malcolm X's favorite film ...easy to understand. It is quite remarkable that almost all the cast is Black. That is most unusual during this period in this country, when there were very few African American actors. Quite effectively, the director uses non-professionals. (The same approach is used in the great Italian NeoRealist films like ""Bicycle Thieves"")  The location shots work. So, for example, there are marvelous shots of gospel singing in a Black Church.  And some of the acting is unbelievably good.  The man's father as a long-gone drunk is one of the finest performances of this type I remember in film.

As it turned out, this film was created by two Jewish men, one of whom had to escape the persecution by Nazi Germany to survive.  So it was with that solid understanding of racism that the film was made with profound sensitivity.

I truly enjoyed the extras which has interviews with some of the actors, the cameraman, and the wonderfully charming director 40 years later. The extras are essential.

This is not just a good film, it is one of the greats.",1357776000,,2401,4.572429906542056

527611,5,6302985870,"Nothing But a Man is one of the greatest American films of all time, in my humble opinion. It's in the same league as Cassavetes' SHADOWS, and is at least as good as the now classic films by auteurs like Bergman, Truffaut, and others, that were coming out of Europe in the 60's. Director Michael Roemer may not have the name recognition of these directors, but his film easily stands alongside theirs, and has stood the test of time very well. It URGENTLY needs to be re-released on blu-ray!",1341705600,,491,4.52808988764045
527612,5,6302985870,"In the early 1960's during the unfolding of the civil rights movement, when Martin Luther King marched on Washington, when three northern civil rights workers were murdered in the south, and when four children died in a Birmingham church bombing, Michael Roemer and Robert Young, two Jewish guys from Harvard, headed south and crafted, in the opinion of many, the most authentic film ever made of the black experience in America. Although racial relations have since altered, the film depicts the essence of racism, including the subtle and less than subtle forms of oppression still present in President Obama's America.

Roemer and Young have expressed some embarrassment at the naivet and pure chutzpah they demonstrated in their attempt to make a film that truly represented the black experience. (The term ""African-American"" was not in vogue at the time.) Yet they insist that in the early 1960's, no one else was doing it. Today, they say, it would be ""unnecessary"", if not impossible, for whites to make the film. Perhaps the fact that director Roemer grew up in Nazi Germany and at age 10 was witness to the destruction of his grandfather's family store on ""Kristalnacht"" gave him the chops to understand oppression.

Few involved in the making of the film suspected they were making a film that would join Citizen Kane and Casablanca as one of American ""classics"" on the National Film Registry of the Library of Congress.

Set in early 1960's Alabama, it tells the story of Duff Anderson, played by Ivan Dixon, a proud black man who won't submit to his expected role. It explores the devastating impact of racism on his working life, his marriage, and his dignity. There is no bloodshed, but the threat of violence is always present. We are told that a lynching took place in the small town only 8 years before. The threats are as subtle as whites pulling into a gas station and asking attendant Duff for ""38-cents worth of gas, and mind you don't make it 39."" Or when a white supervisor, making a lame joke at which Duff refuses to laugh, says: ""What's a-matter, boy, you don't think that's funny?"" The everyday intimidation is humiliating enough, but the primary impact is economic. Duff won't allow his pride to be violated. ""I don't get on so well in most places,"" he tells Josie, the preacher's daughter played by Abbey Lincoln. He isn't a political militant; for him it is personal. When workers are exploited, he doesn't have an agenda mapped out by a union organizer, he simply wonders aloud to his fellow workers why they don't ""stick together"" to make reasonable demands. Of course he is then labeled a trouble maker.

Critics loved the movie, but if universally praised, it was and still is rarely seen. A 40th Anniversary special edition DVD was released in 2004. Itshows to best advantage the stunning black and white high- contrast low-light style of co-writer Young, who also doubled as cameraman due to an absurdly limited budget. The early Motown soundtrack, whose rights the fledgling filmmakers somehow managed to secure, contributes to the mood; performers include The Marvelettes, ""Little"" Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye, Martha and the Vandellas, and others who later became household names. The script, penned by Roemer and Young, is remarkably understated. Emotions boil under subdued, almost perfunctory dialogue. Viewers feel the action; it never clobbers them over the head.

But the film wouldn't be the same without Dixon and Lincoln, who are stellar in their powerhouse performances as Duff and Josie, the couple struggling for dignity in a racist world. As they tell us years later, the actors play themselves. Dixon IS Duff, Lincoln IS Josie. This is the story of their own lives.

Be sure to watch the extra features in the 40th year edition. It is a privilege to see and hear Dixon, Lincoln, and Julius Harris (who plays Will, Duff's alcoholic father), then in their 70's and 80's, talk about the film they made 40 years earlier. Fortunately for us, the interviews of the actors came in time; sadly, all three have since died. There is also a 30 minute unscripted discussion between Roemer and Young in which they tell the story of their experience in researching and making the film, and their feelings about it 40 years later. This is a rare peek into the chaotic craft of film-making.

Abbey Lincoln is better known as a jazz vocalist than an actress. In her remarkable interview, she believes that family is the salvation for blacks. In the film, fatherhood takes the thematic center stage, as personified by Duff's father Will and Duff's illegitimate son. ""A man who doesn't take care of his children is nobody,"" Lincoln says. Her interview is a monologue, more sung than spoken. ""Where are the African Gods?"" she wails. ""We don't know our names...we live without our ancestors...Where are the African Gods who will save us from this misery and shame? Where are the African Gods who live and set us free?"" She tearfully proposes the answer: ""WE are the African Gods, you and me."" The African Gods have been stolen. It is Duff and Josie who must set themselves free.

Abbey Lincoln's tears in the interview, like Josie's in the film, are no act. And when the script calls for Duff to push Josie to the floor in a frustrated rage, concerned director Roemer offers to cheat: ""I can fake the fall,"" Roemer says he told Lincoln. He recalls her response: ""I'm going to take that fall for all the black women."" The fall is one of those classic moments, like so many others in the film, that emotionally freezes the viewer, and remains etched in our memory.",1340323200,5,5593,4.849214659685864
527646,4,6302985870,"This is a very powerful film especially because it was produced in 1964 and it would've been unpopular and controversial at that time.  The main character is just that--he's an African American man who just wants to work, do a good job, have a wife who loves him, and a houseful of children.  Only there is a price to pay in that he has to endure disparaging remarks from the ""redneck"" workers.  As  a result he gets fired from jobs for being a troublemaker because he wants to be treated like any human being, with some dignity and respect and takes them to task for their remarks. Ivan Dixon plays the lead as Duff, a man of many layers and emotions.  Abbey Lincoln plays Josie, the schoolteacher daughter of the local preacher.  She sees Duff as someone who has a hidden strength of knowing who he is and refusing to try to conform to the condescending attitudes of the white establishment.  The whole background of the movie is very stark with the industrial background of Alabama towns, a segregated school(where Josie teaches), a neighborhood of run down shacks, and just the bare bones existence of people in those small southern places of the 1960s.  There is no humor in this film and there is really no happy ending, just a feeling of what may come to pass and it's just hope!",1327708800,,1286,4.536796536796537

527649,5,6302985870,"It is a shame that Ivan Dixon is known for ""Hogan's Heroes"" by mass public and not much more (reminding me of great character actor James Edwards who most people will remember as the valet to George C. Scott in ""Patton"" who had some great roles in war films by Sam Fuller (he was great in ""Shock Corridor as the Black Klansman) but Dixon who had great range and talent is only really known for a few bit parts and his great role in ""Raisin In The Sun"".But such was Hollywood. What is great is that this film was made (with a great supporting cast of fine African American Actors) showing how some great stuff got made if it didn't get wide distribution in early 60's. Perhaps Dixon might have gone on to get roles like Brock Peters,Ossie Davis or James Earl Jones but he made comfortable living in Hollywood a Director (The Waltons and Magnum P.I.) but one would have liked to see where he would have gone with more acting. Abbey?The Lena Horne of her generation a double threat as one of the top tiers jazz singers from the late 50's on I can't say her acting was impeccable but she had presence and charisma that would allow you to forget she was not Dorthy Dandridge or a Ruby Dee (who was?).In any case a left wing funded picture by progressives that eschews politics and ""Black Power"" for a timely treatment of the dignity of African Americans while people were still getting used to Sidney Poitier's ""Good Negro"" portrayals (and patting themselves on the back for it while Poitier was kept in a box with the exception of ""Raisin In the Sun"" and Heat Of The Night"") this was an almost Cinema Verite that captured a story of realism,dignity and reality something that still a rare commodity in cinema when it comes to telling any ""groups"" story.

527653,5,6302985870,"I always wanted to see NOTHING BUT A MAN. It never became the independent hit it deserved to be, yet I can understand why it holds a special place in 60's film history. After watching it last evening, I thought of films like THE PAWNBROKER and a handful of other gritty black and white films of the era: films that realistically and powerfully dealt with adult issues and created a much-needed contrast to the Rock Hudson-Doris Day fluff films that were still quite popular. This film presents its African American characters as realistically as any documentary, with few if any cliches. The late Ivan Dixon plays a young man in pre-Civil Rights America, who has to hang tightly to his dignity as he tries to build a reasonably conventional life under very difficult circumstances in the South. The cast is uniformly good. (The 2004 40-years-later extras on the DVD are interesting to add perspective to the film.) Because wonderful films like this are really time capsules to some degree, I couldn't help but think about all the ""people of a certain type"" today who criticize our African American President because they feel he doesn't blindly praise America at every turn. Some feel he apologizes for America and points out our shortcomings too frequently. Those folks, obviously short on memory, should watch NOTHING BUT A MAN in order to review the plight of one minority group just a few decades ago. I was, luckily, raised in a very inclusive environment so when I see bigotry in films like this, I can't get my head around the kind of mean-spirited people who treat fellow human beings with such contempt. Alas, these types are still very much among us, only they must keep their prejudices to themselves more than they ever had to in the era in which NOTHING BUT A MAN was made. I was only 14 when this film came out and I'm still shocked that this environment existed at all during my lifetime. How far we've come, and yet we have a long way to go. After seeing this film, I hope there comes a day in which it is shown to an audience that is both shocked and unable to grasp that any of the hatred and prejudices so forcefully recorded in 1964 could have ever existed. The power of positive change is best seen in the context from which the change evolved. NOTHING BUT A MAN serves us well in this regard.",1260748800,4,2314,4.591787439613527
