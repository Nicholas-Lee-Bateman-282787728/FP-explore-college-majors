8308143,4,B001H91GDS,Pretty good info as far as racing. It did not seem to really give you the nuts and bolts of motocross but lightly went over some parts of some techniques. It seemed as if the riders did not want to give up any real secrets.,1430092800,,223,3.977777777777778

8308145,5,B001H91GDS,Great for teaching Motocross skill to riders.  Many times a visual is a backup to verbal instruction. This was recommended by their instructor and both boys enjoyed it.,1403481600,,168,5.0
8308146,5,B001H91GDS,"This is another great watch by Transworld Motocross. The interviews are indepth and personal. This DVD will not help the new rider, but those that already know how to ride & race.",1362873600,3,179,4.625
