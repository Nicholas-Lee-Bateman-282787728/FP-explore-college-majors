3743206,1,B001P829O6,"For those of you who already own this movie in SD, save your money on this Criterion release. It is horrible, nearly unwatchable in places ~ like watching a movie through a curtain. Criterion should be ashamed of themselves for resting on their laurels.

Amazon should STOP importing comments from other releases and media when giving stars to a specific item. The well deserved 5 star ratings from the SD disc are making it look as if this blu-ray release is being well received, which is not the case. Of the 65 5 star reviews posted to date, I counted only THREE which were written for this horrific blu-ray release by Criterion. The other 62 are from the prior SD, VHS and Merchant-Ivory Collection releases.

Buyer Beware with this Blu-ray release. Apparently we can no longer assume that Criterion = Good Quality.",1259712000,20,819,4.76056338028169
3743207,1,B001P829O6,"""Howard's End"" was one of the strangest movie-watching experiences of my life. I experienced the entire film as one long introduction. ""Okay, this is the scene where they show us what pretty clothes people wore in Edwardian England. This is the scene that displays the cunning antique cars and charming trains they rode in. This scene demonstrates the arch and artificial conversational norms of the period. This is the scene that establishes the lushness and loveliness of the English countryside in high summer."" Right up until the closing credits, I was waiting for the scene that would involve me in a plot, and make me care about characters.

The acting is so unrelentingly cold, arch, and artificial I have to believe that director James Ivory wanted viewers to see only Vanessa Redgrave, Emma Thompson, and Anthony Hopkins, never the characters they allegedly play. These actors may as well be holding scripts in front of their faces. Never for one moment is political activist and Amazon Redgrave believable as a humble little wifey who does not want the right to vote. Anthony Hopkins is Anthony Hopkins, Hannibal Lector in a high collar. Emma Thompson pops out her eyes and strenuously squeezes out some tears, and you think, ""Gosh, she's working so darn hard for that Oscar.""

""Howard's End"" isn't two and a half hours of nothingness, though. It is a crystalline demonstration of the contempt that self-congratulatory privileged people feel for the working poor. Mind: I'm not saying that the film critiques snobbery. I'm saying that ""Howard's End"" is a perfect example of snobbery among the holier-than-thou elite, from Edwardian England's self-righteous upper crust to Barack Obama's limousine liberal supporters.

The Schlegels and Wilcoxes are two British families who have lots and lots of cash. The Basts are poor. The rich families are handsome, well groomed, self-disciplined, ever so compassionate and circumspect. The poor are beyond any standard of decency or human appeal. Leonard Bast, the poor man, played by Samuel West, is a creeping creature, half maggot, half weasel, and all idiot. He lives his life stupidly and ends disastrously. His wife, Jacky Bast, is a slovenly, slatternly, obese slut. She is shown, most frequently, in a tight, filthy corset that thrusts her assets into the viewer's face, and dirty robe. She does not brush her hair. She eats like an animal, gets drunk, and embarrasses nice people in public. She is never shown working; most frequently she is lounging on a filthy bed.

Leonard Bast could have been shown, as all the rich characters are shown, as having even a rudimentary brain, or dignity, or self-determination. Instead he appears to be constructed of mucus; he is merely a spineless, soulless toy in the hands of the rich characters, whom he discomfits just by existing.

The filmmakers could have shown rich and privileged people for what they really are. There could have been scenes of Henry Wilcox, a forty-year-old rich man, inheritor of massive wealth, taking advantage of Jacky when she was a sixteen-year-old orphan attempting to make ends meet by selling her body to this exploiter. We never see that. What we do see is Jacky in control, Jacky crashing Henry's daughter's wedding, Jacky embarrassing Henry, a man the film invites us to admire, feel compassion for, respect and love. There could have been scenes of the Schlegels and Wilcoxes eating sumptuous meals while Leonard and Jacky went days without tasting food. There could have been scenes of how humble clerks like Leonard, desperate for any employment, supplied the labor that the Schlegels and Wilcoxes rode to their own wealth. We don't get those scenes. What we get are scenes of the rich being sensitive and compassionate and beautiful and artistic and refined and admirable, and the poor being disgusting and idiotic and repellent and unpleasant.

If ""Howard's End"" had peddled hatred and contempt for a race of people - blacks, say - rather than a class of people - the working poor - its contempt and bigotry would be condemned and the film would be a museum piece. Instead ""Howard's End"" peddles the privileged's contemptuous view of the poor, and it is embraced as a classic. Because, no less than in the Edwardian Era, in the ""Bitter"" Obama Era, hatred of the working poor is entirely A-OK.

I recently watched two Nazi propaganda films, ""Jud Suss"" and ""La Habanera."" In both, Ferdinand Marian plays a sexy, racially inferior character who has relationships with racially superior, Aryan women. The ultimate message of these Nazi propaganda films: contact with racially inferior people carries a taint. It is dangerous. Disaster follows. Steer clear of the racially inferior. In this, ""Howard's End"" is no different from ""Jud Suss"" and ""La Habanera."" In ""Howard's End,"" upper class women have contact with a man who is working poor. At least Ferdinand Marian got to be a sexy untermenschen. Leonard Bast is merely creepy, with no sex appeal. Contact with the working poor man brings disaster to privileged people's lives. Elites can leave ""Howard's End"" congratulating themselves for having contempt for the working poor, and avoiding contact with them at all costs.",1258848000,8,5208,5.070011668611436
3743208,3,B001P829O6,"The film itself is superb, beautifully directed, wonderfully acted, and elegantly staged. It is worth owning in your dvd/blu library. But let me tell you my story.....ordered this via prime, and it arrived in two days, I always look forward to Criterion releases, and love my blu-ray movies. I went about my business the day the blu arrived, and when the appointed hour arrived for me to finally relax, I opened the packaging, and put the disc in my player, and I was surrounded with all my snacks and looking oh so forward to this film, which I had seen several times before. The movie started, and Vanessa is walking outside Howard's End within a minute or so, and I see not film grain, but dreaded digital artifacting (noise) in that dark scene. It even went on as the movie moves into brighter scenes. I said to myself, they sent me a regular dvd in a blu-ray package, I'm sure of it. I stopped the movie, reexamined the packaging, it says blu on the back, what the hell. I went online to see if others had the same problem, nothing on the web, except i see on amazon one guy saying it looks bad. Sorry, this thing looks worse then the dvd. I read some glowing reviews about the blu quality of this release, they have to be crazy or my disc is defective. The odd thing about it, in the documentary on the disc, they show in standard def the opening scene I mention at the beginning of this entry, and it looks better in standard def, then the actual hi def scene in the movie, ie., it is certainly softer then the high def but it has no artifacting or noise. I would not be surprised if  there is a re-pressing so to speak of this Criterion release in the future.",1258502400,22,1667,4.325878594249201
3743209,1,B001P829O6,"5 stars for the movie. One star for this disc. I bought this to upgrade from the previous release on DVD which was a very good quality DVD. As this was Criterion and Blu-ray I expected the best print yet of one of my favorite films. To my disappointment this disc if full of snowy grain and flickering in any of the darker scenes. The opening shot of Vanessa Redgrave walking around the house in the evening is ruined with a blizzard of snowy grain. Some of the scenes have a grid-like band across them. I am assuming this is from a defective batch as I see other people are having similar problems. Yet other people seem to not have problems so obviously not all discs released are bad. I, however will be returning this piece of junk. If there is a better disc out there I would like a replacement otherwise I just want a refund.",1258416000,13,831,4.2993630573248405
3743210,1,B001P829O6,"I have loved this movie since I was a teenager. As far as Edwardian-set period films go, this is definitely one of the all time best. That's why it breaks my heart that after months of anticipating owning this film in high definition, the final product that I received is of extremely poor quality to say the least.

Unfortunately, it appears that there is a major issue with either the way this disc is being pressed over at Criterion or the way the HD master is being transferred onto the Blu-ray. The picture on my copy is FILLED with digital noise and snow. It's not just a mild amount that might have proved mildly distracting, but a thick layer of white grain that looks as if I'm peering through a blizzard.

I logged on to amazon earlier today to see if anyone else was having this same issue and sure enough, others are reporting the same problem on varying levels. The issue is definitely not with my player. I have a magnificent Oppo BDP-83 which always delivers the finest High Definition picture possible on my new Samsung LCD. Should I return my defective disc in hopes of receiving a corrected copy or just inquire about receiving a full refund? I'm really not sure, but I am certainly sad that I am being deprived of enjoying one of my favorite films due to a production error from the otherwise phenomenal Criterion collection.",1258329600,56,1344,4.572614107883817
3743211,5,B001P829O6,"The film is wonderful and the Blu-ray transfer is fantastic. It's a clean image with oodles of detail and beautiful, natural colors. The only thing I didn't like so much is that the musical score is quite bright at times, which is disappointing being that I love the score. I don't know if that is due to the way it was originally mixed or if that is Criterion's fault. The audio mix in general is decent considering it's a low budget period drama. This is certainly the best presentation of Howard's End that I've ever experienced.",1257724800,,532,4.552083333333333

I certainly had no such problems with 'A Passage to India' and ' A Room with a View'. My BluRay player is a top of  the line machine so I am sure it's not my hardware.

Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins are sublime - a pure joy to watch.  The adaptation of Forester's novel is fluid and respectful of the many aspects of the book - a difficult, sprawling story.  It creates an urgent narrative for the cinema while maintaining Forester's lush, romantic, and easy-going tone.  I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this film.  It's many layers keep me watching over and over.  It made an Emma Thompson fan out of me.  No other actress could embody Margaret as Thompson did.  She brings radiance and humor to a difficult and central character to portray - balancing everything just so.  She makes it look easy.",1244592000,4,803,4.753623188405797

Sadly, it's an absolutely atrocious transfer. We thought we'd just gotten a defective disc, and had Amazon send us another. But, the problems were the same with both discs. Basically, every scene that isn't in bright sunlight (and there are many) is nearly unwatchable. It's filled with the most distracting ghosting and video noise. Absolutely appalling. Furthermore, and equally maddening, the sound isn't quite synced correctly. It's not off enough to seem completely wrong, just enough to drive you slightly mad. I'm really shocked. I've never had this happen with a Blu-Ray, and never had to write a review like this. Do not buy this item!",1357171200,11,824,5.021897810218978

I have played three copies on two blu-ray players and the problems were always the same.  However, the real reason I am writing this review is to recommend that it be played at 720p instead of 1080p.

3743247,1,B001P829O6,"Movie 5 Stars- Transfer 1 star

If you have an Oppo Bluray player, this will be the worst bluray transfer you have ever seen. Worse than any VHS you have ever owned. Snow- Artifacts-flickering picture- you name it. The sound is good, however.
I contacted Criterion, as everyone else that has posted about the deplorable transfer, and they said to adjust my settings- and/or they will send me a replacement disc. Do NOT waste your time. Criterion did something wrong in the mastering of this bluray and for some reason on an Oppo Bluray player it has a problem. I have a PS3 and a Samsung Bluray player as well and it looked terrific on these units. This is not an Oppo problem, this is a Criterion problem. This is a 5 star film and I will NEVER buy another OVER PRICED Criterion disc. I should not have to take an expensive Criterion Bluray out of my main player to play on my gaming TV through a PS3 to watch this fine film. (nor should I have to recalibrate my TV to watch it-Are you kidding me?) I hope another company puts this great film out on Bluray, because Criterion blew it and lost a customer.",1352419200,7,1105,4.364077669902913
3743248,5,B001P829O6,"There is a layer of rich splendor created in the cinematography of this film in its deftly applied attention to detail. A film critic's essay included with the Criterion Blu Ray edition notes that Merchant/Ivory productions had decades of experience in making the sets look authentic and lived in, and while having appreciated it to some degree in previous viewings on VHS, DVD, and even streaming  - these true details brought forth in such clarity in the Blu Ray version explode in a violence that took my breath away. Set in London's early 20th century, the film dresses its people and furnishings in subdued hues of browns, greys, beige, olive green  and powdered blues  - the shocking contrasts of colorific beauty are highlighted and segment the film when it switches to Howards End in its springtime glory, or Leonard Bast's nature walk out of London, or his wife Jackie's tacky fuchsia wardrobe. There is a level of intent from the filmmaker in these transitions and contrasts that becomes evident and meaningful to the story craft and is only fully appreciable in the Blu Ray.

I've seen this film dozens of times and never before had I noticed how many beautiful and stunning scarfs and shawls Margret dons throughout the film. Let alone the glorious Wedgewood, China, and amazing works of art that inhabit all the sets.

However, when I first started the Blu Ray I was horrifed and thought it was an exceptionally poor transfer. It was as grainy as a beach, with white dots littering the screen. I was able to resolve this by changing my TV's settings to appreciate the picture. My TV comes with a range of preset brights/huges/and balance controls - which of course you can use to set your own as well. I usually have mine set to ""vibrant."" However, this was too much for the delicate film work here and had the film screaming bits of grain and white flashes at me - a switch to my TV's ""cinematic"" preset made the Blu Ray brilliantly rendered. If you find the Blu Ray lacking, play with your picture settings. If you're like me, you have your colors and brightness up rather high and this film requires darker settings - I guess its like the equalizer settings on your stereo, you wouldn't use the same settings for rock-n-roll and classical. I'm not a techie so I don't know how correct my assessment is, but I do now that once I made the adjustments, the film was still in absolute high definition, and far more stunning and visually engaging than the DVD.

Faithful to the book there is nary a detail left out, a few minor details are juxtaposed here or there for a tighter film fit - In my judgment this is the most faithful and positively perfect rendering of a classic book to film ever attempted. The script is expertly crafted, and it is cast under the divine intervention of kismet. Thompson and Hopkins have undeniable chemistry. The film is quite simply a masterpiece and it is a rare example of film's capacity  to harmonize with other art forms. The written word is brought to life, the soundtrack is exquisite, and the locations are teeming with exuberance and life.

Yet this film is most certainly not for everyone, as evidenced by the  many ""It's boring"" reviews here. There is no instant fix, explosions or romantic endings.  Like any work of literary fiction, plot is not the catalyst here - the human experience is exposed through patient character development letting you experience E.M. Forster's most poignant commandment:  ""Only connect.""",1343347200,4,3475,4.746268656716418
3743249,1,B001P829O6,"As a motion picture industry professional, I am appalled at this transfer.  Given the overall flatness of the base image, it was obvious that the transfer was from the original negative, or internegative (IP/IN).  There is extreme noise in the shadows, manifested by a breathing oscillation in those areas, as if the Criterion/DI colorist was working with bad calibration parameters and either deliberately or unwittingly jacking up the shadows to an extreme - and artificial - level.

It is unwatchable.

I would have given it a rating of zero stars, but that was not an option in the dropdown textbook.

What is wrong with Criterion, anyway?  Their black-and-white transfers (SEVENTH SEAL and 8 1/2) are utterly sublime.  On my Pioneer Elite Kuro plasma I feel as if these films have that wonderful motion picture film-theater look-and-feel.  Color materials, however, seem to be problematic for them; THE LAST EMPEROR was abominable: blown out highlights and very murky shadows.

But, having labored mightily to calibrate both my LCD tvs properly, I must add my voice to those who have problems with this transfer.

None of my other Blu-rays seem to have such soft processing nor do they seems as unfaithful in terms of color.

I remember an astonishingly beautiful film. Perhaps the actual film stock M/I used was subpar, turning many fleshtones pink and lacking the warmth one would expect from proper color temperatures. It's a disappointment from Criterion.

The transfer is absolutly horrible.  I had to readjust my TV to compensate for how bad the digital noise is on this bluray.  The only other disc I've seen this on is the BBC edition of the Planet Earth bluray and even then it only showed up briefly in a couple shots.  I have watched many blurays on my TV and never had them look as bad as this.  The disc is overly dark and there is a digital ""static"" in many places.  Very very bad.

For what it's worth, this film is supposed to be an indictment of the class system in Victorian England.  I won't spoil the ending but I think it's very telling who will end up owning Howard's End.  I don't think Henry Wilcox is very sympathetic, nor are most of the ""rich people.""
