4112294,5,B003DWS04U,"Yes--MESSAGE FROM SPACE is a fantastic, well made Space Opera which obviously was intended to capitalize on George Lucas' INSANELY popular STAR WARS. That said, MESSAGE FROM SPACE holds it's own against other quality, cult classic 'rip-offs' such as Italy's 'so bad there good' 'War of the Robots' & Luigi Cozzi's 'STAR CRASH', U.S.A.'s Roger Corman classic 'BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS', and of course our own T.V. series 'BATTLESTAR GALACTICA.' However, in my humble opinion, 'Message' has that extra ""Ummmph!!!"" the previously mentioned films lacked--that 'devil may care' over the top acting, and amazing Japanese special effects topped only by the multi-million dollar budget of 'Battlestar.' While I DO own a dvd copy of 'Message' (that is only decent at best), I was shocked and excited to see the name of the film pop up on Amazon's search engine. FINALLY! A proper copy for me! I was prepared to even shell out as much as $30 + shipping to get it--but imagine my HORROR at the PRICE--$999??? Yes--NINE HUNDRED AND NINETY-NINE DOLLARS!!! Sellers-how DARE you? And Amazon-you should be ashamed to even list it. Is ANY film worth a THOUSAND dollars? Nope. I assure you that no matter HOW cool of a hard to find film this is, NOONE but some rich Sci-Fi geek who hit the LOTTERY would pay that price. And THAT is stretching it. You'll be holding onto your copies for a long, LONG time at that price. I'll be content with my sub-par version until Tokyo Shock gets enough fan letters to properly release the film in all it's remastered glory. So PLEASE--if you ARE a fan of 'Message' like me, --write to Media Blasters (who own Tokyo Shock) and tell them WE WANT MESSAGE FROM SPACE!!! And again--SHAME ON YOU sellers...I hope your thousand dollar copy deteriorates with age as you wait for a 'sucker' to come along...",1320364800,5,1815,4.801916932907348
4112295,4,B003DWS04U,"In the wake of the unprecedented box office bounty of George Lucas' seminal STAR WARS in 1977, filmmakers around the world raced to unveil their own epic space operas, all hoping to strike gold mining the same cosmic vein.  Among the most prominent of these international productions was Toei Studios' MESSAGE FROM SPACE (UCHU KARA NO MESSEJI), released in the United States in the Autumn of 1978 by United Artists.

The planet Jillucia has been conquered by the Gavanas Empire, its natural beauty devastated after years of war. The few survivors call upon their gods and are given eight magic seeds (that look like walnuts), which they send out into the universe to find eight champions to help Jillucia overthrow its conquerors. The seeds end up in the hands of a motley crew - including a disgraced Earth general Garuda (Vic Morrow, COMBAT!) and his robot, a couple of young ""space hot rodders"" (Philip Casnoff, DOLLHOUSE, and Hiroyuki Sanada, LOST), a thrill-seeking heiress (Peggy Lee Brennan), and an exiled Gavanas prince (Sonny Chiba, STREETFIGHTER, KILL BILL). Ultimately, these individuals embrace their destiny and unite to face the evil Empire and save Earth from destruction.

Fast-paced, absurd and fun, MESSAGE FROM SPACE is a giddily insane interplanetary samurai fantasy, loaded with space dogfights, laser battles, swordplay and explosions. The miniature effects are extraordinarily well-crafted, and the production design is lavish. The cast is pretty good, too; I really like Morrow as the noble, drunken Garuda, and, of course, Sonny Chiba rocks as the ronin-like Prince Hans.  Etsuko Shihomi - better known to cult film fans as ""Sue Shiomi"" of the SISTER STREETFIGHTER films - makes a lovely space princess, even if her character is sadly under-used and she never gets to demonstrate any of her legendary ass-kicking skills.

 The story owes as much to traditional Japanese chambara (samurai cinema) as it does to George Lucas' space opera, and while Western audiences might find it both convoluted and juvenile (especially the magic, glowing walnuts!), I actually find it to be a rather charming outer space fairy tale.

Like Toho's THE WAR IN SPACE of the year before, MESSAGE exhibits a distinctively Japanese aesthetic, with many striking images, including a schooner-like starship with solar sails. Interestingly, a number of scenes and images from this film were echoed in later American sci-fi films, like Roger Corman's BATTLE BEYOND THE STARS (1980), and even by Lucas' STAR WARS sequels, especially MESSAGE's climax, which is uncannily similar to the climax of RETURN OF THE JEDI, released five or six years later!

Personally, I never imagined that MESSAGE FROM SPACE would ever be released on DVD in the U.S., and definitely not in widescreen, but, much to my surprise, the original Japanese/International cut is now available on an NTSC format, region-free import disc from Eastern Star. Presented in a nearly flawless, 1.85:1 anamorphic widescreen transfer, MESSAGE looks terrific! Both the original Japanese language track and the English dub are included, both in 2.0 stereo, although the English track is somewhat muffled and has a soft background hiss. English and Chinese subtitles are available. Special features include a still gallery, several original Japanese trailers for the film, and trailers for a couple other Eastern Star titles.

If you enjoy Asian fantasy films or 70s space opera, you owe it to yourself to check out MESSAGE FROM SPACE. If you're already a fan of the movie, I can't recommend the Eastern Star release more highly.",1301616000,21,3585,5.210069444444445

4112298,5,B003DWS04U,"This is a review of the Eastern Star HK release, aka ""special uncut widescreen edition.""

I've been in love with this movie since I saw it on ""Star Channel"" (IIRC) back in 1979 or so, and ordered the DVD as soon as I saw that it was available. I expected a mediocre transfer from a dirty, scratched print; what I got was a great-looking transfer from a great-looking (if not pristine) print. From the crisp menu screen to the end credits, this DVD is glorious. It looks fantastic on my HDTV.

The story is but a minor tweaking of ""Star Wars"" (that is, the inanely retitled ""Episode IV: A New Hope""): Earth people team up with a space princess to save the universe from a bad guy in a helmet and cape. Spaceship models on wires zoom around; space samurai fight with electric swords; lots of stuff blows up real good. What I find endlessly fascinating is that the designers of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi"" borrowed elements (action scenes, ship designs) right back.

The performances are just what you'd expect: completely over the top. (Fans of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost/dp/B0036EH3WU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost</a>&nbsp;might enjoy seeing a very young Hiroyuki ""Henry"" Sanada as a freewheeling pilot turned reluctant hero.) Vic Morrow chews the garish scenery like the grizzled pro he was. When he gets maudlin over the ""death"" of his faithful servant robot, it's as touching as it is silly. And speaking of silly, while ""Star Wars"" rises above the fashion sense of the mid-1970s, ""Message"" celebrates it. ""Disco Space Wars"" would be a more on-the-nose title.

My only gripe is that there's not a ""comprehensive"" or blended language version. The English-language version features the American actors' voices, but the Japanese actors are overdubbed by the Titra crew (the guys who did the ""Speed Racer"" animated series and countless Shaw Brothers kung fu movies, as well as the US dub of ""Mad Max""). The Japanese-language version seems to feature the Japanese actors' voices, but the American actors have all been dubbed into Japanese. I'd really love to have a version where all the actors spoke in their own voices/languages, like they did with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gunhed/dp/B001IOQW4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gunhed</a>.

Guilty pleasure? I don't feel guilty at all!

Note: This version appears to be out of print or otherwise unavailable. Despite comparable image quality, I find it superior to the newer Shout! Factory version, which has only the international (English) audio, not just for the Japanese audio but for the bonus features, including Japanese theatrical trailers.",1280880000,26,2720,5.4336492890995265
4112299,5,B003DWS04U,"From War of the Robots... Star Crash... Finally, a Star Wars 1970s Cash-In/Rip-Off that delivers! At least til Battle Beyond the Stars.  Very little photographic effects as they literally ""flew"" the model ships in traditional Gojira fashion.  Also blowing them up with on the set pyrotechnics. The final fiery crash of the large Gavanas battle cruiser that destroys Julita is the most coolest thing ever.  Also adds to the term ""sea of stars"" with the star ship looking like an old sailing vessel. Having an international cast really works well in these Japanese films. Complete with Sonny Chiba ass-kicking action.  Some hammy acting, dialogue, and super ""feel good"" touchy storyline is forgivable.  I'm finally happy to own this DVD release that contains both language tracks with subtitles. Still the film hungers for a 5.1 remastered soundtrack. Also it gives some memories of the classic laserdisc arcade game Astron Belt.",1276473600,8,927,5.194630872483222
4112300,5,B003DWS04U,"This movie came out in Japan within a year of ""Star Wars"" release in '78 and was released throughout the U.S. shortly thereafter and on television shortly AFTER THAT. I've read it was made into a tv series in Europe. There are so many familiar elements - spacehips, robots, space pirates, spunky princesses in distress - all elements well known to Star Wars fans, just done the Japanese way. Story? I don't remember the story and I don't care - something about finding these seeds. The main thing is just seeing how ""Star Wars"" was mainlined into this production and how it's stylistically translated. It's neat to watch this and think how Lucas might've done his epic if he couldn't have got a movie deal in the U.S. and instead went to Japan and made it. That's the fun of it, and nothing else did it like this. There were a number of things that came out on tv and in the movies right after Star Wars, from Saturday morning kid shows like ""Jason of Star Command"" primetime stuff like the original ""Battlestar Galactica"" and movies like ""Battle Beyond the Stars"", all of which tried to capture the fire started by ""Star Wars"". ""Message From Space"" is one from that period that has eluded release for all this time and it's GREAT to see it finally out there in a quality form. One question - Where is it Amazon? Are you just takin' orders to see what the demand is before they press any copies and fill any of them. Is this REALLY available? I'm planning to keep my order in place until it is. As a movie that measures the impact of Star Wars in the late 70's, this is one I don't want to get away from my collection.

You have to laugh as the characters wear plastic grape leaves around their heads. Then they solemnly pray over walnuts to fly off and find the heroes.

This movie has the lore of a ""chosen one"" theme way before it got over used.  It also has pretty good dialogue.  It may not be always executed well, simply because many of the acting was voice over dubbed, but it still worked for me.  This IS a foreign B film after all.  My expectations were not high, but I was relieved when the story began to develop.  And what an awesome space story it is.

Some of the special effects are pretty good and hold up.  Then some of the effects are terrible which was common for the time.  There were some effects that were just drawn animations... you can tell.  But you get the picture of what they wanted to do.  What I love about this, is that there are some scenes that look BETTER than some of the special effects today. Not kidding.  The space chases inside the vehicles are pretty awesome.  They capture the fun fantasy of flying in a space chase.

Sounds like STAR WARS? Yes, but it's not and what's wrong with a space movie that has a few similarities to STAR WARS?  I loved that about the movie.  In fact, give me more of that please.  The universe could be filled with countless space operas that have battleships and helpful robots.

I had been seeing pictures on the internet of the villain and always wondered what film he was in.  My usual suspects were, Starcrash and Battle Beyond the Stars, but I was very wrong.  I screamed with joy when I saw the villain in this movie.  He's wonderful and so is his mother!

This is not a perfect movie, but I can forgive all of it's flaws for the wonderful story a group of eight chosen champions to save the world of Jillusia.

The title of this movie is a little underwhelming though and because of it, I kept putting off seeing this movie.  I didn't expect such a good movie.  If I could accurately name this movie it would be ""The Chosen Eight"". The actual ""Message From Space"" is a reference to a brief moment 54 minutes into flick when the villains send a message to Earth to surrender... which was a sub-plot within a subplot.

The last layer of awesome in this movie is the fact that it is a Japanese production giving us a  little bit of that Voltron force / Power Rangers feel to the story.  I just loved that!!!!!  This has it all for me and that is why I gave it five stars.",1457913600,5,2533,4.258403361344538

THE STORY: A long soap opera in space that tells the story of a peaceful toga-wearing peoples on a distant planet who are beset by strong-armed, anti-social, black-garbed villains. Desperate for help, these oppressed peace-lovers launch a handful of sacred walnuts into space which will mystically select a few heroic ""chosen"" types, who will then arrive to defeat the naughty bad guys.

THOUGHTS: Ever wonder if you could make 105 minutes can seem like 1005?? Here's the answer. Please don't get me wrong, I love Japanese sci-fi. Godzilla, Gamera and Ultraman are three unshakable pillars of my treasured childhood that I cannot imagine being without. Apologies to all you fans of this film, but for me MESSAGE IN SPACE worked better as an non-narcotic alternative for insomnia than as a movie. It sorely tested my patience (and endurance), literally taking me three attempts to make it all the way through. Despite some cool costume designs and the typically excellent use of miniatures & pyrotechnics that Japanese sci-fi & kaiju films are known for, MESSAGE is mercilessly strangled by interminable, show-stopping scenes of melodramatic exposition drier than decades-old toast, delivered by actors who will bring tears to your eyes - for all the wrong reasons. I had never seen MESSAGE FROM SPACE before and figured it would be another kitschy flick I could add to my guilty-pleasure collection of silly fun Japanese monster movies... but it just left me cold. For a better Japanese intergalactic romp I recommend WAR IN SPACE instead. For my money W.I.S. is far more well balanced and entertaining. I donated my copy to the local library. Nuff said.

THE DVD: Another in Shout! Factory's long line of top shelf home video releases. No complaints about the audio & video quality of the product. Picture & sound for MESSAGE FROM SPACE are quite good.

But they obviously love the material and are having boatloads of fun with it.

And yet for the period it has a surprisingly good effects budget. Granted it is put to shame by Lucas changing the game.

The directing, the overacting, the hand-painted costumes, the sets... All of it is so perfectly overdone, I thought this was a proof-of-concept film done today using those ancient techniques. But this film debuted the year after the first Star Wars film! Regardless of when it first appeared, this film is sheer genius. There are obvious nods to various other shows, including Star Wars.

As a foot note, The Guardians of the Galaxy video recently released by Marvel has a plot almost mapped straight from this old epic. Rag-tag renegades beat up Big Bad Evil Dude with helmet and cape and his whole army. Instead of Groot, though we have Liape seeds.

Well, I can only assume he meant the ""Hardware Wars"" parody with Ham Salad where planet Basketball is blown away, and flashlights become light sabers because of a fog machine.

Yes, Message from Space is aimed at children, and so was 'Star Wars', or at least in theory.  The huge difference being that Star Wars was shot better, had better acting, better scoring, better special effects, and a deeper story.  Where Message from Space looks like it was thrown together in a few months time, shot in that amount of time, and then thrown up on the big screen.

I did NOT see this in the theatre when it come to the USA, and I am forever grateful that I gave it a pass (yes, I knew Bob Wilkins was lying to me all those years ago).

Whoever reads this review, don't see this movie.  Not even for the camp factor.  It is a stupid film as is.  I could shoot the same script and turn it into a sci-fi masterpiece, but someone in Japan didn't want to take the time and care to make a proper sci-fi film for kids, and instead made some quasi jingoistic, poorly acted, poorly shot, poorly directed film to ride off of 20th Century Fox's smash hit from 1977.

Aimed at kids?  Yes.  Will kids like it?  No.

Previous year Toho also released similar space opera film, ""The War in Space"" also inspired by Star Wars. It was indeed the time Japanese film makers eagerly tried to beat the Hollywood in sci-fi area but since then animation series like Star Blazers, Gundam, took the heart of both sci-fi fans and young audience. Sadly space sci-fi opera in live-action movies are no longer a mainstream genre for Japanese film makers today.

It is really enjoyable movie as a parody of great sci-fi films and animation such as Star Wars, Star Blazers(particularly opening is similar to Star Blazers), Chinese classic ""Water Margin"" and its Japanese adaptation in 19th century Nanso Satomi Hakkennden(The Eight Dog Chronicles). As other works by Fukasaku, he excellently bring in youth culture during late 70s to his film when Tsuppari(bad boy style) was recongnized as cool for young adults. Special effects and action sequence is well-made considering it was made in late 70s. Even ILM staffs who visited the studio were said to have been impressed by their works.
Sonny(Shinichi) Chiba is doing brilliantly for sword action as expected.

Verdict: One of the fine action sci-fi films by Japanese film makers during late 70s
Rating: 78 out of 100
Recommended for: Late 70s Japanese sci-fi film fans and the fans of Japanese sci-fi animation such as Star Blazers. Also for fans of Sonny(Shinichi) Chiba.",1367971200,3,1489,5.048780487804878

4112415,3,B003DWS04U,"-This is a review of the 2013 Shout Factory release-
First off, I have to say that this is one of my all time favorite movies... The three star rating I've given has more to do with the movie's presentation than the movie itself....
After all these years, ""Message"" is finally available in a legit edition... Problem is, it seems like such a horrendous rush job of a release...
The liner notes and packaging by August Ragone and Patrick Macias are great! But when you pop in the disc, the minimal main menu and non-existent chapter menus automatically clue you in to the disappointment you're about to experience if you're a fan of this movie...
While it's great to see a copy of Message sourced from the American theatrical print - complete with the end credit sequence in tact (something missing from all past cable airings of this movie) it's sad to say that the picture quality pales in comparison to that of the R2 Japanese release from about 10 years ago... Glaringly so. In fact, 3 of the 4 included trailers for the movie are apparently sourced from said R2 release; while its great they were included they're almost slap in the face to the fans as to the quality of the disc -that could have been.-
In short, very happy to see a legit version of this -very happy with the extras, packaging, and liner notes. Very disappointed that the best presentation possible wasn't made... From all the fine print regarding copyright on the back cover, it seems better source material was available and not used... After seeing how high Shout Factory raised the bar with their releases of the old school Gamera movies, there's really no excuse for this... I'm more than a little disappointed, and will certainly be holding onto my home-brewed bootleg of this movie - a rare instance of a bootleg being better than a legit release.",1367193600,15,1826,4.656346749226006
4112416,5,B003DWS04U,I saw this movie a long time ago & just saw that it had come out on DVD. I have the VHS copy but wanted the DVD copy of it. It was a great B rated movie.,1360972800,,153,3.1621621621621623
4112417,5,B003DWS04U,"I'm so jazzed that SHOUT! Factory will release the premier Japanese Star Wars rip off.  This movie is fantastic, I love it, and highly recommend it!!
Now all we need are Region 1 DVD/Blu-Ray releases of Godzilla 1985 (Return of Godzilla), Space Battleship Yamato (2010), Orgus (original anime series), Gorath, Warlords of Atlantis, Robo Warriors, When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth, Beast of Hollow Mountain, Pulgasari, The Human Vapor, Planeta Burg (Original & Uncut), & The Ivory Ape.",1360627200,2,482,5.259740259740259

Would I recommend this movie to a friend?  Yes!  Absolutely!

4112419,1,B003DWS04U,"""Space Nuts"" is what my buddy called it after I dragged him and our 2 dates to see this movie in the theaters many years ago! To this day, he has never let me forget it. This movie is by far the worst space saga ever! It is so bad that I just have to have a DVD copy of it. As others have mentioned, the trailers were cleverly crafted and covertly deceiving. I actually expected something worth watching? I was terribly wrong. Vic Morrow was just a Japanese attempt to attract US movie goers, as they have done in the past, by employing 'out-of-work' American actors like Nick Adams of ""The Rebel"" TV show fame (Yes, I'm that old!). This movie is so bad, you need to see it to believe it! Enough said.",1346198400,,701,4.2
4112420,1,B003DWS04U,"this movie reminds me why the internet is so amazing.  My friend Craig Baker and I saw this in the theatre when it first came out when I was 14, i think we might have been skipping school because it was a weekday afternoon.  Only reason we stayed in the theatre after the first 15 minutes was that we were in Ottawa in a pouring rainstorm and needed a couple of hours to dry out.  I was trying to describe this campy Star Wars rip-off to my wife the other day and all I could remember was this chick in a bikini swimming in outer space with a mask that looked like something my kids bought at Walmart.... Oh, and catching space fireflies too.  And I forgot about the flying Dutchman in space and the glowing walnuts and the bad dubbing....  I couldn't remember the title so I googled ""space fireflies"", and there you have it.  Reading about this movie again really takes me back.  Like I said, the internet is an amazing thing.  I look at this now and I don't think I appreciated the whole Japanese film/anime culture aspect to it when I saw it.  At the time i saw it, to a 14 year old sci fi film geek in 1978, I think I was just pissed off that the film was so lame (even the floating biniki couldn't save it).  Based on the trailers we were hoping for at least a semi-cool star wars rip-off.  So unless you have personal memories of this movie that take you back to a time and place you want to relive, or are a Japanese C-movie buff or a collector of really bad, campy sci fi (a la Barbarella or SCTV's Zontar and the glowing cabbage effect) and have run out of other stuff to spend money on, then don't bother.  Of course, if you are reading these reviews then chances are you already fall into one of those categories, in which case enjoy!",1333670400,4,1745,4.191616766467066
