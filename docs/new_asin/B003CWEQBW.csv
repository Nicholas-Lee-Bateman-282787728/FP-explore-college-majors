8394508,4,B003CWEQBW,"An interesting insight into one of the more obscure aspects of WWII naval history, this DVD tells the story of submarine design that was intended to take the war to mainland USA in a novel way.  In the end, the changing nature of the war itself meant that by the time the boats were ready there was little point in using them for their intended purpose.

This documentary provides a fascinating look at the design problems that had to be solved and some of the features of the design that were so advanced and secret that the US Navy had to sink the example they obtained at the end of the war in case the USSR acquired it.

Footage includes interviews with the only surviving aircraft pilot that served aboard these submarines as well as underwater glimpses of the wreck of the boat the US Navy sank.",1416614400,,801,4.4353741496598635
8394509,5,B003CWEQBW,"I found ""Japanese SuperSub"", part of the PBS ""Secrets Of The Dead"" series, to be a very well made, informative and enjoyable  DVD. It chronicles the development of the Japanese I-4XX series submarines that were developed as a strategic weapon during WWII.

The video sets the stage quite well, explaining the situations that led to the development of these sub-aircraft-carriers. The Japanese, following the attack of ""Doolittle's Raiders"", were completely unable to respond. The Japanese recognized that they had no weapons to take the fight to America. Thus, they decided to develop a submarine that could carry aircraft to bomb either American cities or the Panama Canal.

The DVD does an excellent job of using period video and stills (admittedly rare) together with computer generated graphics to show the development of both the submarine and the aircraft (Aichi M6A Seiran) to accomplish the task. There were a lot of challenges Japanese engineers had to surmount including: building a sub with a large chamber to carry aircraft and the catapult systems to launch them, an aircraft that could ""fold up"" and ""warm up"" its engines without having to start them and, of course, just creating a craft that could get all this done over a long-distance cruise.

The film showed that the sub never fulfilled it's role simply because by the time engineers and manufacturers worked out all the problems, the war was nearly over and the thought of attacks on the American homeland were pure fantasy.

This was a very good DVD at a great price (I bought it for less than $10) and well worth the viewing. I give ""Japanese SuperSub"" five stars.",1385942400,2,1637,4.95985401459854
8394510,5,B003CWEQBW,"As usual, PBS's Secrets of the Dead is a great choice!  This is a very detailed account of the famed HUGE Japanese I-400 submarines in late WWII. What a story!  Too bad they didn't keep (1) of these beauties to carry on through history.  Future generations would not believe this venture.",1362268800,,288,4.607843137254902
8394511,5,B003CWEQBW,"I enjoyed the DVD on the Japanese Supersub and had no idea that they had developed a submarine with such capability.  This product is truly outstanding and I recommend it to anyone who loves
history.",1288310400,2,199,4.685714285714286
8394512,5,B003CWEQBW,"I've seen at least one other documentary on this subject and it was poor.  This documentary, however, is pretty good.  It demonstrates that these boats were huge and way ahead of their time.  It also indicates how much their mission changed over a short time.  And it indicates how the loss of their sponsor hurt them.  Perhaps the most insightful part of the documentary is how the subs used so many resources for so little value--they consumed a lot of steel and yet were only capable of launching three planes.  They share this trait with the German V-2 ballistic missile, which cost a lot of money and yet delivered a very limited payload to a target with poor accuracy.

One thing missing was any mention of the fact that the Japanese captain who committed suicide may have done so because he was responsible for slaughtering allied sailors earlier in the war and may have feared being tried for his actions.",1280620800,3,913,4.66875
8394513,5,B003CWEQBW,"This dvd is an amazing documentary on the incredible Japanese super subs- the I-400 and I-401. For almost an hour you will be glued to your tv as you take in the great footage , interviews and possiblities of these stealth subs. The program has several experts on Japanese aviation and naval histories going over the subs  attributes. Its great to watch something historical that packs this much information into a small window, its very well done. One of the experts Osamu Tagaya was featured on another "" Secrets Of The Dead"" program- Dogfight over Guadcanal- and hes written several books on Japanese aviation.

The top secret program was led by Admiral Yamamto. He wanted to bring the battle to the American mainland to instill fear in the American people. He sent a few test missions with regular subs to see if they could get through to the US coast and deliver such an attack. The first mission was to attack a Calironia oil refinery, which worked to a small extent. The next attempt was on the Oregon mainland. A submarine launched plane attempted to start a fire in the woods of Oregon, which failed to ignite. But the main part of the plan was to get through to their targets. This allowed Yamamto to go ahead and build his stealth subs. His original plan was to make 18 of the giant submarines. The subs were to have a hangar on the top that would allow for 3 planes to be housed within its walls. These planes could handle up to 1,700 pounds of bombs. And they could be launched off the coast to take out US targets. The I-400 was also equiped with a 140mm gun, 4 anti air guns and 8 torpedo portals.

The problems of designing the I-400 were numerous and each one is examined in this dvd. How could they fit planes into this hangar? How could a conventional sub design operate with a huge hangar on its top? How could the sub be built to avoid detection from American sonar? How to keep the planes engine oil warm, so they can take off as soon as possible? Each problem is solved by the Japanese with brilliant designs. The design of the sub as well as the way the planes fold and fit into the hangar is fascinating. The stealth of the planes is another aspect that makes this show fun to watch. Having the last living member(Atsushi Asamura) of the Seiran pilots in the program for interviews is priceless. They are also a few members of the I-400 and I-401's crew still alive as well. And they talk about how great they were treated. Tsugio Yata recalls the amount and quality of food they received on the sub was beyond their belief. This shows how important these elite members of the Japanese Navy were. Because most of the Japanese soldiers were starving and dying of thirst on island campaigns throughout the Pacific war. In April of 1943 Admiral Yamamto,s plane is shot down and he dies. This put the I-400 program is jeopardy. Time is wasted as the Japanese decide what to do, meanwhile the Americans are developing the Atomic bomb. The program is cut to 9 subs, down from Yamamto's original dream of 18.

As the war goes on the US starts to control more and more of the ocean. Which makes the Japanese plans for the I-400 change. There are several ideas that they come up with, but they have to change as the war gets closer to Japan. AT the end of the war, they decide to launch an attack geared towards the Americans who are stationed at Ulithi Atoll. Aircraft carriers and transports were located there. The mission commences, however the dropping of the atomic bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki end the war. Just as the subs are ready to test their abilities the war ends. That doesn't end the story. The Americans discover the subs and ask for their surrender. The commander of one sub, won't give up his sub. And the men don't want the Americans to have their sub that they grew so attached to. After a lot of tense moments the Americans take the sub over and have to trust the Japanese who greatly outnumber them. The commander is so upset that his ship is surrendered to the enemy that he shoots himself.

After the war the Soviet Union wants to get their hands on the technology. But the Americans decide to send them to the floor of the sea. Another amazing fact is how the technology and foward thinking of these subs would be seen in the future of several countries submarine sytems. There is some footage of divers who locate and film the sub as it lies on the ocean bed. All of this and a whole lot more is in this 52 minute dvd! This was great to watch. It makes you think of how lucky we were. Its also refreshing to see a topic this amazing finally getting some coverage. If this were a German sub, it would have been discussed at nausium by now. This is one of the best documentaries I have seen in a while.",1276041600,11,4745,4.418285714285714
