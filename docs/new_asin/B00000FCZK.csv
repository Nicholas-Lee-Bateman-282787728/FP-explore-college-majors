This follows a family as they watch their daughter go into downward spiral into addiction. Cheesy yes, but well made for it's time.",1397692800,6,246,4.369565217391305
7908111,4,B00000FCZK,"Previous reviewer--Lighten up! This is a fluffy 1980 something made for TV movie. The premise of the story is about two parents who thought they were raising their children right, one day got a rude awakening when their seemingly perfect older daughter became hooked on drugs. Gangs and drugs don't just happen in the ghetto to latch key kids of single parents, it happens everywhere and sometimes with the person you least suspect. Hence the title ""Not my kid"". The movie was excellent and the actors were amazing; The family played by George Seagal, Stockard Channing and most of all Viveca Davis as the older daughter, all give solid performances. The ending of course was a little cheesetastic (what do you expect, it was the 80's) but I would recommend watching it if nothing else is on or even if something else is on (Down with reality TV).",1309132800,6,847,4.72972972972973
