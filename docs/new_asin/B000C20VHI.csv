8095318,2,B000C20VHI,I must not have read the description very well. I had assumed by the headlines that the movie was an historical fiction of some sort. We were heading to Siena with my family and I thought this would be fun to watch ahead of time. My family lasted about 5 minutes. I watched about 30. It was less than entertaining.,1469145600,,314,4.25

8095321,4,B000C20VHI,"The video includes many scenes of El Campo and preparations for the Palio.  One race was shown, and the dejection of the loosing contrada seemed real enough.  But I was somewhat disappointed in this video.  Apparently it was produced by a film company who employed actors to portray some Sienese people in the film.  I was expecting a documentary.  So when I realized that the stories were created for the video and that actors, rather than ordinary citizens, were acting and telling the stories that accompanied the race, I felt let down.",1371600000,,539,4.815217391304348

8095323,5,B000C20VHI,"This documentary takes the viewer deep within a Siennese tradition that is nothing short of religious--the twice-yearly running of the Palio. The Palio is a wild 90-second bareback horse race in which covert bribery is permitted;  jockeys are allowed to freely flog each other, but not each other's horses; to make secret deals with each other at the starting line; and in which horses who happen to be riderless can still win if they come in first. The film explores with real depth and sensitivity the emotion, pride, and love which the Siennese put into their preparations for the race. There's a fierce edge of competition between the seventeen contrade (districts) of Siena, each of which has its horse and jockey, its own colors and customs, mascots and superstitions. We follow the fortunes of the Civetta (owl) contrade

Interviews with longtime citizens have genuine honesty and interest, in particular the ones with 92-year-old Edigio. It was a quiet pleasure to see him so engaged in the world--pruning with vigor in his garden, cooking what looked like an excellent meal, greeted with respect by everyone, and of course, following the Palio as the lodestar of his very full life.

The cinematography is splendid, and does justice to a beautiful city and a fascinating tradition.",1299888000,2,1290,5.046948356807512
8095324,5,B000C20VHI,"Fascinating documentary about the yearly Pailo horserace through the streets of Siena, with each randomly assigned horse representing a different neighborhood.  There are also backroom dealings and bribes that are oddly accepted as part of the whole  tradition. The nearly religious fervor the population puts into the preparations for the race, and the emotions they put into the results are fascinating. mostly endearing, but at times verge on frightening.  You can see how people can get so swept up in being a part of something that violence is a possibility. Theres a kind of intense mini-nationalism that calls to mind fascist and other movements.  But here, it is sweet  the sense of neighborhood and pride at its most intense.

Among the highlights is a 92 year old with the energy of a man 30 years younger, who still has the race as the center of his being, and the generally splendid photography.  A wonderful chance to get a look inside a culture without almost any exposition, just images and words from the people themselves.

Another review here claims that some of the key people we see and hear are actors. None of the professional reviews that led me to watch the film echoed that claim, but if thats the case it would diminish my respect for the film, so based on the faces and personalities we meet, considerably.",1298505600,,1333,4.815789473684211
8095325,3,B000C20VHI,"THE LAST VICTORY may appear on the DVD cover to be a story film, but in truth it is a documentary - in other words the story within the film is true and untampered.  That fact makes the film even more entertaining, especially to those who love Italy and the traditions about which the casual visitor knows too little.

In Siena there is an annual horserace called the 'Palio' in the city's center piazza (Piazza del Campo). The event dates back to medieval times and represents the theme of solidarity of the seventeen various neighborhoods (contrada) of Siena, each of which has a symbol and a coat of arms with accompanying flags and regalia.  THE LAST VICTORY follows one of these contrada - Civetta - as its closely bonded families prepare for the Palio.  They wear the colors, they set up long tables of food, and they raise money to compete in the race. A few days before the Palio each contrada wins a horse through what seems like a lottery and that horse is praised by the populace, a jockey is chosen and the race begins.

The tender part of this ritual is supported by the fact that director John Appel has selected members of Civetta - Egidio Mecacci, Paolo Rossi, Alma Savini, Roberto Papei, Camilla Marzucchi and others - and follows their moods and excitement and preparation for the big event.  The 92 year old Egidio is perhaps the most charismatic as he relates the sad history that that the Civetta has not won the race since 1979 and all hopes 'ride' on the beautiful horse that is assigned to them.  The preparations are intense: the piazza is ringed with dirt over the stones to create a running track, the horse is groomed, and the members of the neighborhood gather and sing and eat in hopes they will win the Palio.  The ending of the race is best left for the viewer to see, but in the course of just over a minute the race is complete and the impact the results have on the Civetta are telling.

Appel and his crew have captured the essence of an important Sienese tradition and this little quiet film shares insights into the Italian sense of camaraderie and familia that is all too rarely seen today.  The film is touching and worth viewing - for education and for entertainment well presented as a documentary.  Grady Harp, October 06",1160265600,8,2264,4.538083538083538
