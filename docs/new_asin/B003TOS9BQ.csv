8405339,5,B003TOS9BQ,"So I had originally grew up watching this series on ondemand in middle school. As a grown woman I forgot how all around obnoxious this show was, how well developed each character was and the rude outdated slurs that were used constantly.

Best decision of my life to add this to my anime collection. Not to mention it had come sooner than anticipated, so i'd go right on ahead and say Santa came early this year! When I found out it came in, I rushed outside to bring it in and wasted no time opening it up and enjoyed the nostalgia I had seeing it finally in my possession! Haha",1435104000,,579,4.263636363636364
8405340,1,B003TOS9BQ,"It was disappointing that the cover and everything inside are so fragile that the disc holders were too tight and the handles that holds the rest was falling out like a dropped cupcake. The story was kind of off somewhere here and there, but it was okay..",1409702400,,255,4.446808510638298
8405341,1,B003TOS9BQ,"the packaging is absolutely terrible! it came in the mail broken,, the spine was broken and a chip off the top broke off. also discs 5 & 6 were loose in the case so they were scratched. it comes in a cheap plastic case. the disc holders are so bad too. they are near to impossible to take the disc out. I bought a new 10 disc case for it and as I was switching the discs one of the discs was so hard to take out that the disc snapped in half. I do not recommend this set. its a better idea to spend the extra money and get the two separate seasons.",1383091200,,548,3.8157894736842106
8405342,5,B003TOS9BQ,"I've seen the anime before and really liked it, I was just really disappointed that the second season had never been released stateside, so low and behold my surprise to find a set that has all the episodes and included the dub ADV did of the first season.

I was almost afraid I was buying a boot leg since I'd never heard of the distribution company but I really am pleased. The case is a bit different than I was expecting, instead of being a regular box set it's more of a rounded clam shell case, but all the dvd's are well organized and the set itself is of good quality.

This is probably the best version of the show to buy, it's got both seasons in japanese and the first season in english along with some bonus material and the picture is good quality, I highly recommend it if your a fan of the show and have always wanted it in your dvd collection.",1378857600,,860,4.206060606060606
8405343,5,B003TOS9BQ,This anime is amazing! I love the characters and seeing Shabuya! They got every detail right about Shabuya so when you wander around you can recognize the settings!,1376870400,,164,4.892857142857143
8405344,2,B003TOS9BQ,"The box to this set is very cheap and easily broke, it seems, when it arrived.  I'm too lazy to return it and have long lost the opportunity window to do so, but I felt inclined to write this review, because I thought that it was just the box that broke.  Nope.  The second disk in the set BROKE.  Cracked.  I'm sad that I won't be able to watch all the episodes now..unless I find the free way online.  Either way, I wish the box had been more durable.",1364083200,,453,4.033707865168539
8405345,4,B003TOS9BQ,"I love this anime but, I was upset about second season because it was all Japanese audio. The Product Details show it was Japanese audio and Dubbed English but, my dvd boxset had: ENGLISH & JAPANESE LANGUAGE* (*English language and Dolby 5.1 only available on episodes 1-26) written on it. I bought it thinking it included all 10 discs (Season 1 and 2). Never did mention exactly that it was only dubbed for episodes 1-26 in the Product Details. At least I can watch it but I hope that when you sell stuff make sure to include relevant information especially when its shows an asterisk (*) followed by words written in small letters.
All in all this WAS a GREAT ANIME. Lots of drama, romance, comedy, and exotic characters.  d(=^0^=d)",1363305600,2,734,4.6461538461538465
8405346,5,B003TOS9BQ,I love this series. It has a child like way to it and man is it funny. I recommend that you watch it.,1354060800,,101,3.4347826086956523
8405347,4,B003TOS9BQ,"This anime is one of my guilty pleasures.  It's so kiddish and cheesy but it's something I just can't help love.  The only thing that I was a little dissapointed in was the fact that when you receive it, the cover isn't very appealing to look at.  Just a simple plastic box with a paper of the printed cover.  Also, when I received it, it was cracked at the side of the box, but I believe that was more due towards the shipping than the actual people selling it.  Overall, it was an excellent anime, I just wish it wasn't in some cheap looking plastic box.",1327881600,,556,4.2075471698113205
