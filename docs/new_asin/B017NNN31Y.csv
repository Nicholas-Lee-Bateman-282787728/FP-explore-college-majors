7508247,1,B017NNN31Y,"Main reason I purchased a rental for this movie was for Anthony Hopkins. Even if all I was interested in was watching him act, ei good acting, by him, making it a good movie. It would have failed.
After about 30 mins we turned it off. Couldn't take it anymore.
The dialog was horrible and would just jump to a random ""nostalgic"" moment. Then there was the content sequences that read more like a really bad 80's music video.
Poor acting by everyone, the best actor was Kenny Johnson by far.
Poor plot. Poor cinematography.

7508249,5,B017NNN31Y,I'm glad I rented this. Great acting. Plot twists. Part thriller with a question of morality and ethics. Script was very original.

7508250,5,B017NNN31Y,"The plot summary was a turn off for me, but I like both Hopkins and Farrell and the trailer was promising, so I rented on a slow night.

I'm really glad I did.

The story itself turned out to be the strongest part of the movie, which was a surprise to me as the one thing I was dubious about was the whole 'psychic consultant to the FBI' angle.

The acting was solid with flashes of brilliance that more than compensated for a few bits of flat dialogue and awkwardness.

The staging, pacing and visuals ranged from very good to great, and you only noticed what I assume were budget constraints in a few scenes set in public spaces (and it's not enough to take away from the overall quality).

A few blemishes, but unquestionably 97 minutes and $6.99 well spent.",1481846400,146,761,4.368794326241135

7508252,4,B017NNN31Y,"John Clancy (Anthony Hopkins) is a psychic detective and is the real deal. He is called in from retirement to help with a serial killer that doesn't leave any clues. He is working with his old friend Joe (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and partner (Abbie Cornish). What we soon discover in this who-dun-it is that the killer is also psychic and is better at it than Clancy.

This is an odd mystery and the fact is we see glimpses of the killer in the mind of Clancy...and PLOT SPOILER if you haven't figured it out, look at the DVD cover art which is my biggest peeve. However, the who is not as important as to how they get a guy who knows their every move before they make it. Always an interesting film with Anthony Hopkins.

7508269,5,B017NNN31Y,"I can think of no better words to describe this movie other than superb and outstanding. It deserves ten stars, not just five. It is almost impossible to write a film, direct a film, and act in a film that explores a moral question and yet be exciting, likeable, engrossing, indeed terrific in every way. This film does it. Both the drama and the moral issue it raises are done superbly, and in good taste. Both Anthony Hopkins, who is always very good in all his films, and Colin Farrell, are great in this film.
It is about a psychic, an FBI psychologist, and an FBI senior agent who are trying to find who murdered three people they know about. Each is killed in a way that causes the victim no pain. The murderer leaves no clues, no fingerprints, no DNA, nothing.

7508288,5,B017NNN31Y,"SE7EN + THE ORDER (Heath Ledger) + ANAMORPH (Willem Dafoe), with echoes of SAW, HORSEMEN, PREDESTINATION (Ethan Hawke) and 12 MONKEYS.
^ -- If you enjoyed at least 2-3 of those, SOLACE will be worth a go, it does offer something new.

SOLACE takes the quantum biophysics angle to psychokinesis/precognition (Hopkins by way of Rupert Sheldrake), in which Anthony Hopkin's character - go to heavy hearted FBI clairvoyant - is confronted by another of his kind in the course of solving a series of previously unconnected murders -- a Keizer Soze to Hopkins' PTSD Sherlock Holmes -- the Cosmic Horror invoked by this tempter leading Hopkins along in what ends in either a Faustian pact for which the investigation is merely an initiation, or annihilation -- grows with Hopkins' increasing uncertainty as a pawn in a game where the rules shift with each move . . .

Hopkins provides the most sympathetic iteration of Dr. Lecter on the other side of the fence in SOLACE, and he makes you invest in the supporting cast he looks after too. This should be yet another tired murder mystery drama, but the writing succeeds in transcending with the not-outlandish implementation of this soothsaying ability cast against a primal Trickster with even greater ability. The consequences and questions of the value of time, noble lies, euthanasia, medical consent, consequentialism versus deontological ethical codes it raises serve the end of heightening the psychological thrills and dramatic tension in what is ultimately a poignant, cathartic end not commonly seen in this sort of film's type, casting or budget.",1525910400,,1599,5.099236641221374
7508289,1,B017NNN31Y,"This is an awful film that actors should watch to see when a great actor like Hopkins fakes it, he's still better than anyone else on the screen.  The other actors are so terrible in comparison and even Hopkins seems befuddled by some scenes he is in yet he does make it possible to sit through this.  The real surprise was why he would actually executive produce this turkey.  He's been great in terrible films before, it is about making money after all.  He is still one of the greatest actors of all time, I wold suggest that maybe he's not the best at picking films to produce.",1525478400,,581,4.351851851851852

7508298,5,B017NNN31Y,"I very much enjoyed this movie... I found Anthony Hopkins's character to be quite somber and he almost seems to be indifferent as he uses his psychic abilities to try and help stop a string of murders. I don't like to give too much details to anyone who might read any reviews I give, but I found out Why he portrayed this character as he did, and his performance was brilliant as always.
Colin Farrell's role is that of the serial killer. His character brings many sub plots to this extremely well written psychological thriller of a movie that drew me into a place I wasn't expecting to go, and caused me to think about right versus wrong on a deeper level, thus making this a Very Good Story.
This movie I gave 5 stars because it was so well written and Actually Lived Up to what I was Hoping for, and was Not just another "" FBI tries to stop a serial killer"" movie... The Acting was great and !This! was The Movie I was Hoping to see and it Delivered!",1524700800,,955,4.252747252747253
7508299,4,B017NNN31Y,"Pretty damned good psychological/paranormal thriller, inasmuch as we have two sterling actors, Anthony Hopkins and Colin Farrell, in the roles of adversarial clairvoyants working opposite sides of the law.

Hopkins is showing his age badly now, but he's still agile as a cat with his dialogue.

This is a heady film, for the most part, asking the viewer to ponder whether mercy killings should be classified as acts of homicide or acts of kindness; but it still manages to deliver some decent action and crime-scene chills and thrills.

Also features some fairly beautiful visual effects, as when Hopkins clairvoyantly observes a deceased woman's last moments before her death in a bathtub full of lilies.  Slick piece of digital work.

The film does demand your undivided attention, because the plot is rather serpentine and filled with non sequitur clairvoyant visions that intrude into the storyline, and there's not much refresher dialogue to bring you up-to-speed as the film progresses.

No spoilers here, but it does have a mildly surprising ending.",1524441600,,1056,5.218934911242603
7508300,4,B017NNN31Y,"As if Lecter wasn't smart enough.  Looking at the thumbnail, I was hoping that Hopkins got to play the 'good guy' in this one, since usually his mega-mind characters are 'bad guys.'  (In 'Fractured', Hopkins played an irredeemable bad 'un.  But don't kid yourself about Lecter just because he whimsically let Clarice live: Hannibal Lecter was a ghastly cop-killing monster.)  In this story, Hopkins plays a 'good guy'--but only from a certain point of view.  If you're dubious about the 'psychic' angle, you can have faith that Hopkins wouldn't sign on to a dumb script -- to my knowledge, he never has.  As always, his voice is a musical instrument, his delivery melodic and rhythmically subtle.  Relax and enjoy the master at work.

As for the story, I haven't figured out yet whether it makes sense .  What's the difference between the good guy and the bad guy in this story?  Is it anonymity?  Consent?  (At first, I thought the 'two word' description was 'May I?')  I'm curious how Ambrose didn't know the truth about Clancy -- because Clancy had buried the pain so deeply in his own mind?  Is this why Clancy's marriage fell apart?  And why doesn't Ambrose just kill himself?  Ambrose doesn't know the truth about Clancy but he does know what will happen -- that if he 'kills' Katherine, she won't actually die but Clancy will pick up his mantle and carry on -- i.e., after Clancy unblocks his own truth and realizes what he did was right?  Not bad at all.",1523836800,,1462,4.6484375

I've been able to suss out the plot more often than not. This was a well-done move without it becoming too warped by all of the pre-cognitive scenes.  Even the flashbacks were executed well enough to be recognized as what they were.
There were gradual modifications during each pre-cognitive episode to prepare us for the last third of the movie's excellerated, but compressed outcome. Very artfully done!
The casting was very good!  Each actor brought believeability to their roles.  Our female agent specifically had the most difficult role as she was required to act a change in maturity without using those terrible cliches to do so.  She came through as genuine and beliveable.
Don't blink or critical information for further enjoyment of the piece will certainly be compromised.

The movie,  and its characters, was superficial and flat (even Mr. Hopkins' character was flat, I'm sorry to say). The premonitions of impending doom for the characters, tried hard to evoke an emotion by giving the characters a quick ten second sob story about why we should care about them...they died, they lived, who cares. The worst part was the ""serial killer"", who just showed up out of nowhere and freely confessed, ugh!

7508344,3,B017NNN31Y,"The title of this movie was so befitting, since I found that the only thing I needed ""solace"" from was from watching this garbage. From the music choice to the editing, it was like the film makers couldn't make up their minds as to what the end production should be. This film is one part Saw, one part Silence of the Lambs, one part Stir of Echoes and two parts of any bad cop films produced in the last few years.. The plot was cheesy (and not the good cheese either. More like bad cheese left on the counter to fester for days). It completely lacked credibility (the concept of a ""Battle Royale of clairvoyants"" is something that doesn't sound good as a passing thought let alone someone actually taking the time to put the story into paper).  The script was below mediocre and I was highly disappointed. Especially since Lionsgate usually puts on better productions than this. The ONLY reason I'm handing this film three stars is because of the cast. Anthony Hopkins will always be his best no matter what script they throw his way and Jeffrey Dean Morgan is pleasant to watch on any given day (can you say ""drool city""   )  The acting managed to give the movie a slight hint of depth (emphasis on the word ""slight"" ).

7508360,4,B017NNN31Y,"This is a well made, very well acted movie on the issue of the preciousness of life. It carries you through the ordeal of AH's character went through while sufferring the slow and apparently painful death of his young daughter some years earlier with the plot line of a serial killer who only kills those he deems in need of death; this includes some terminally ill but also very depressed adults and a child with a ""pea"" sized brain tumor who was asymptomatic. At the climax of the movie, AH confronts this ""killer"" who in turn accuses AH of being one too. You later find out that maybe he is.
Despite the contrasts of beauty and horror, the final message is that there is a place for Kevorkian-like mercy killers and that they get to decide who and when someone should die. None of the dead asked to be put to death. AH's daughter was under medicated to be sure (as a doctor, this was plainly evident to me). This movie makes a pass at supporting the ""death with dignity"" controversy but does neither side any benefit, really. Life is precious, to be sure, and not ours as physicians (or serial killers) to decide when and where it will end. That is in the hands of our sovereign Creator. Uncontrollable pain is a very rare passage to the life beyond. Complications that escalating pain medicine needs given strictly to anneal the pain can certainly include death.

the female detective was clearly cast for her looks and not her acting ability.  a bland performance where apparently it was enough to play her own interpretation of a tough FBI agent...and her interpretation was shallow with no personality or deeper motivations.

jeffrey dean morgan dies halfway through.  he also fails at portraying a tough FBI agent.  why does these people think that FBI agents have no personality??  being serious on the job does not mean that you have no personality.

overall i think every role was miscast.  maybe anthony hopkins would have been better as the ""villain role.""  it would have made more sense since the character was dying.  would have been more believable for the 80 year old to be dying than the 40 year old.",1519603200,,1118,4.619289340101523

7508375,2,B017NNN31Y,"Whenever a big name, prestigious actor such as Anthony Hopkins lends his prominently billed name to a direct-to-video project like ""Solace,"" potential viewers wonder whether or not it's a case of going through the motions of showing up for a bit part and a paycheck. The good news here is that Hopkins' star billing is genuine (he is also one of the films producers), as is his acting. He gives a solid performance in the lead role of this offbeat thriller. The bad news is that the film's other flaws, especially an overambitious director and script, mean that Hopkins is practically the only reason to watch.

In Solace, Hopkins plays John Clancy, a psychic who has been called in by the FBI to help on difficult cases in the past but has been in seclusion since the death of his daughter. But a new serial killer, who seemingly leaves no clues and no pattern to his victims, has the FBI baffled, so Clancys old friend Special Agent Joe Merriwether (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) begs him to take the case. Clancy reluctantly agrees, to the chagrin of Merriwethers by-the-book partner Katherine Cowles (Abbie Cornish), who doesnt believe in Clancys abilities. Not surprisingly, she gradually comes around.

Solace is not like TV shows such The Mentalist or Psych, in which the consultant is simply a shrewd  reformed con artist. Clancy actually does have psychic abilities, but they manifest themselves in bits and pieces of images that are impossible to decipher at first. Ostensibly, these bizarre images are supposed to enhance the mystery of the film, but in actuality they are nothing but directorial gimmicks that allow director Afonso Poyart to trot out bizarre montages featuring flowers, balloons, animals, blood, and whatever else strikes his fancy. Obviously, your mileage may vary as to how much you appreciate this type of artistic flourishes, but these sequences confuse and slow down a movie thats already, despite a high body count very slow moving until the last fifteen minutes or so.

Theres not much real mystery in Solace; the killer (Colin Farrell) pretty much just walks up and introduces himself to Clancy in the movies last half hour, without such bit of showmanship, he would never have been discovered. It turns out that he is a psychic himself, using his powers to predict the police moves, a development that sounds much more interesting than it actually is. What little mystery there is in the movie has to do with the killers motive, which is original and I won't spoil here, only to say that, without all the needless camera trickery, the discussion between Clancy and the killer about the motive would have been far more interesting.

Its always enjoyable to watch Anthony Hopkins when he is actually into a movie, and he instills in the role of Clancy a sorrowful dignity that gives the movie a degree of gravitas beyond the thriller plot elements. Colin Farrell and Jeffrey Dean Morgan, who are both actors capable of hamming it up, also play it seriously. As a result, some scenes in the movie are worth watching, but not enough. This is a film that could have worked as a cat-and-mouse thriller or, possibly, a character study, but the directors bizarre camera work disrupts the pacing far too often, and the attempt to raise moral issues in the script falls flat as well. Viewers can find some solace in watching Solace, especially as an Amazon prime freebie, but not enough for me to recommend.",1519430400,,3426,4.859589041095891

True mercy is willingness to surrender everything to God so He can work His miracles and step back in faith, peace and patience because some times healing and correcting takes time.  And only God can heal and correct the insanity of the thought system.  Pain, sorrow, loss and death is to learn to remember what we really don't want.  Remember Jesus Christ transformed from physical to spiritual and transitioned from a merciless world to a merciful world and so too will we.

I love Anthony Hopkins in anything he portrays and he delivers a fine performance as he's always done. I could have done without some of the double imaging, but it was bearable. I don't think some of the clairvoyant play-by-play were realistic, as if reading them out of a book as both clairvoyants went, but Hopkins is the main attraction.",1518307200,,460,4.691358024691358

I think the less stellar ratings are coming from viewers of lower maturity whom have yet to process the philosophical themes of the plot in there lives; and thus experience a higher level of cognitive dissonance as these subjects are encountered in the viewing of the movie.  Films such as this, like those of Stanley Kubric, introduce and highlight subject matter that due to it's ambiguity or negative aspect is too easy to avoid in normal circumstance.  Shining a light on the hidden, or unconsidered aspects of reality,  is the real value and gift that truly great films bestow upon society.",1518307200,,677,4.9035087719298245

Like some others who reviewed it, I read the Amazon plot summary and it just didn't sound that interesting. So I passed on watching it several times. Then I saw it as one of the movies others watched under the Jack Reacher ""Never Go Back"". Now I'm interested because thats the kind of I movie that I like. Fast paced, a lot of action, interesting characters, well acted and a good story line. So I decided to watch it. Sometimes I'll start a movie and it just seems boring. However, as the plot unfolded I had a feeling that this would be good and it was.

Not only is Anthony Hopkins is one of the main story characters, he is also the executive producer, which should make you interested as well. The cast is great. The movie is well acted and directed and the story keeps you interested with its plot twists. If I understand correctly, this movie was never released in theaters, which is a shame as it would in my opinion be one to recommended to your friends.",1518220800,6,1034,4.357512953367876

I have to be a bit elliptical to avoid spoilers.
My brother died of complications from cancer two years ago. He fought his illness for a several years and would have preferred to have controlled his own destiny.
Controlling destinies, including your own, creates real dilemmas and this movie frames them in a useful and not too trite way.  I am not sure I would want to discuss it after watching it as opposed to meditating on it.
This is one of those movies where the core idea carries the movie: Not the acting and certainly not the script.

If you liked Silence of the Lambs or Seven, you might like this.  I'd say that it falls a bit short of the two latter films (I'd suggest because you don't have quite the same acting rapport between Hopkins and his co-lead). Still, it's a formidable psychological thriller.

I have to give this movie big points for its success in using nonlinear devices very effectively to portray psychic phenomenon and flashbacks (and in creating a congruity between both). Use of such devices is anathema in screenwriting due to difficulties inherent in departing from a manifestly logical plot progression without upending things through inserting one Deus ex machina after another or simply lapsing into cliche.  Here again, Anthony Hopkins seems uniquely capable of holding things together.",1517616000,,893,5.095890410958904

Great to have your friends around for a thriller movie and and for many hours you will keep discussing it with your friends.

7508566,1,B017NNN31Y,"Throwing into the mix of so-called ""mercy killing"" the element of precognition fails to mask the horrific nature of taking a life (even if it's self) because of illness and suffering. The usual fare of hollywoodesque denials for God's existence, and His preeminence over life and death, fails to justify taking into our hands the power over life. Glamorizing the taking of life is a denial that, even at the last moment, the Lord Himself can snatch a life from the grip of death and suffering, and restore it to health and happiness. How many suicides and ""mercy killings"" might have ended in healing and happiness, but mankind, in his limited wisdom and lack of foresight, takes matters into his own hands. Soon, euthanasia will become legally commonplace on the basis of economics under the guise of ""quality of life,"" as it already is in Denmark and Finland. In America, Hospice is already perpetrating the euthanization of people diagnosed with terminal conditions. The weapon of choice is excessively high doses of morphine, and even ""tainted"" morphine. Meanwhile, Americans move through their little, individual lives with not a thought to what's going on under their very noses. The lack of value on life in modern times will only lead to our ultimate self-destruction. That, my friend, is an ignominious existence in and of itself. Such can only happen in hearts that have a God-vacuum. How pathetic indeed.",1515974400,3,1415,5.0

7508586,5,B017NNN31Y,"Brilliant movie! Parapsychology is the study of paranormal and psychic phenomena. Although many doubt these human abilities, I strongly believe that there are those with gifted mindsets who have powerful sensing abilities. Senses that go beyond one's sixth sense! In my opinion, all humans have the ability to truly connect with this world and thereby heighten their ability to sense what cannot be viewed with the naked eye. Just like air particles, earth's magnetic fields, or even pathogens in the atmosphere, there are atoms that cannot be seen with the naked eye. I empathize with those who have such insight into other people's pain and suffering. To be able to feel that level of intensity over and over, every day and every hour, by itself is traumatizing. Such persons may suffer from manic depression. In the end, when they showed him alleviating his daughter's suffering by injecting a drug into the saline cap, I completely understood why he did what he did. From a psychology perspective, I would like to emphasize the importance of grief counseling. When a family member suffers from a terminal illness, the other members will be exposed to some level of psychological distress. Some mismanaged distress may lead them to extreme circumstances of killing the one who is in deep pain. It is important to identify this at the onset and treat all family members by preparing them for what is to come, ""hope"" in all its form of subtle existence etc. I loved the movie.",1515801600,,1477,4.912

His ability to force other actors to raise their bar, by doing nothing more than being Anthony Hopkins is remarkable, and he did it here.

I enjoyed all of the main actors - Anthony Hopkins, Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Abbie Cornish and Collin Farrell - their acting was solid. Just reading the movie's description doesn't do this movie justice at all. You get the impression that this is just another tired 'psychic helps the police' movie, but it is far from that. The way Hopkin's character goes about having visions is different than anything I have seen portrayed in a movie. It is nuanced and an incredible experience to witness. Loved seeing things through his eyes. I will definitely watch this again as I am sure I missed a lot. I am not a huge Collin Farrell fan, but he did a great job in this. I also enjoyed seeing Jeffrey Dean Morgan. He did a great job with his character. The beauty of this movie was the intertwining of the lives of these characters and the dichotomy of pain and love woven throughout the story. Bravo!",1515196800,3,938,4.556213017751479

This movie is a combination of those three movies. It had me thinking angel vs devil for awhile, definitely had moments of characters splitting up and seeing what happens as in ""Next"" and definitely will make you think for awhile it's a remake of Meet Mr. Black. I thought for sure the main villain was Death. After I saw that I almost made the mistake of not watching any further. It felt, at first, like another Hollywood movie staring Will Farrell ""Instant Rekall,"" which was a remake of Arnold Schwarzenegger's ""Total Recall."" Coincidentally Will Farrell himself is in this movie.

So it had all the elements of a little bit of this and a little bit of that thrown together to make a little bit of a new movie.

I was wrong, of course. The movie keeps you guessing and even after all is explained, still has a last minute surprise in the final scene.

This is a cops vs serial killer movie where Anthony Hopkins plays a very good psychic taken in as a consultant for his cop friend. There's a very clever serial killer who's always a step ahead.

Psychic says no go, but looks at the files that are left. Snips of ""things to come"" keep flashing thru his mind. He works with cops. Uses some of his abilities.  Young female cop, thinks the whole plan is dumb. She has a degree. She's good looking with a nice chest which is conveniently housed in a blouse that's one size too small.  Car chase has lots of crashes, people running, sidewalk furniture flying and, the most cliched: when bad guy escapes in a yellow cab, he is pursued by young cop and psychic. Cab turns a corner, cop car follows only to see a line of yellow cabs come into view. Where is the bad guy?  If this took place out west, the bad guy would hustle off on a steer and the posse would wind up in a stampede.  Ok, so we haven't seen Mr. Farrell yet, so who will the killer be.  As for Mr. Hopkins, I can't agree that his movies are always a must watch. His voice and facial expression hasn't changed in 40 years.  He can deliver lines well.  The rest of the cast is ok for the movie, but even though there are a couple of plot twists that might not be apparent before they happen, I can't see this as a must watch film.

7508691,4,B017NNN31Y,"Good story.  Reminded me of 'Suspect Zero' but that was about a trained MK Ultra Remote Viewer.  Hopkins and Farrell were good. It felt a bit forced and the dialog could have been better, especially with Abbie Cornish, whom I love on general principle, but she seemed to be forcing her lines too much, possibly because she was working so hard on her American accent. She stunk it up to high heaven in my opinion. She's a good actor for the most part. She just didn't fit in that role. She seemed out of place and amateurish. She has been far more believable in other roles. Sorry Abbie. This movie could have been done better overall.

It is up to Anthony Hopkins to figure out why the opposing psychic is killing the people he is killing and what is the ulterior motive. Lots of twists and turns and lots of great performances.

He seems to have matured as a man, and especially as an actor, in such a profound way.  Actually made me look back at his career, and pick up several other movies of his.

I can also tell you that the 'psychic' parts are very similar to real psychic experiences, where you get 'flashes' based on touch, anything from a picture to a feeling to reams of data.

I was surprised to see that a certain other well known movie star was in this movie but he isn't mentioned in the cast listing here. - don't want to give a Spoil Alert, so I won't say who it is.  The only part I feel wasn't a good fit was when the other agent was in the hospital - that entire dialogue was weird in the movie and what the end result is of that scene.  Don't think that should have happened.

I am barely have way through the movie and have heard the word John fifty times. One scene involved saying John four or five times in twenty seconds. This is such unnatural dialogue. I can not think of any film or TV show recently that repeatably says a character name. Feels like a episode of the twilight zone. Message to producer, writer and director.

None of  the characters  deserve  a sympathy,all of  them look like  accomplished  idiots. Was  confused by 5-4 stars the audience gave  this  film. I guess  there were  young , very young people. So here's  my advice: Watch the ""Seven"" movie with  Brad Pitt. Watch the ""Gift"" with Kate Blanchett. Or at least try to find the Russian detective story ""Do not bother the executioner"". They did much better job, the story plots that you will never forget. The script writer was  an as*hole with a mediocre plot, I don't know what on Earth Anthony Hopkins is doing there.  Oh, nearly forgot: the director of photography in  the ""solace"" is a surprise, nice  filming.",1495843200,4,781,4.7368421052631575

7508934,3,B017NNN31Y,"I'm so sorry to have to say that this movie was very disappointing.  Hopkins shines in a few moments and appears to be thinking about something else a lot of the rest of the time -- and not just when his character is caught up in a psychic reverie.  It all starts out looking very good.  The FBI on a case that has them baffled so they call in a man who used to use his psychic gifts to help them out.  The friendship John, the psychic, developed with Joe, one of the FBI agents, has lasted through the years, which makes for an interesting set up.  But then stuff happens in the plot and it all goes to hell.  By the end it's not clear if someone is talking in someone else's mind or just thinking about what's happening and we're listening in.  There are multiple possible outcomes which are flipped through until the director settles on one.  Very confusing and probably supposed to be deep.  The little twists near the end has been telegraphed for most of the movie so its more like a clear path than a twist, and then the movie is blessedly over.

This was almost a total waster of Anthony Hopkins, and my joy at seeing Jeffrey Dean Morgan get a good break in the movies turns into disappointment that it wasn't a better vehicle for him.  As for Abbie Cornish, she basically walks and says lines.  I wasn't impressed.  I guess she was saving herself for a better film.

All in all a sad waste.",1490054400,3,1398,4.286259541984733

7508940,4,B017NNN31Y,I always look forward to Anthony Hopkins and this film was no different. It became a triple crown with the addition of talented younger hunks Colin Farrell and Jeffrey Dean Morgan. The plot was surprisingly affecting and thought provoking. The acting was believable and intense. My only disappointment was in the producers again choosing a non American speaking actress for an American speaking role. My ear kept picking up the at-times jarring Australian accent that 's Cornish couldn't completely master. It kept me from appreciating her work as an actress. I could also have done without the needless gratuitous nude and sex scenes which did nothing to add to the integrity of the story.,1489968000,5,690,5.06140350877193

7508956,3,B017NNN31Y,"With a solid, talented cast that includes Anthony Hopkins, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and Colin Farrell, I had high expectations for this suspense drama.  As far as the acting of the talented cast, they didn't disappoint but to me the story was a bit of a disappointment.

Even though the movie had an interesting premise with the whole psychic thing, I really felt that the story didn't live up to the promise of suspense thriller that it intended to be.  The story is a bit disjointed and kind of drags along in a muddled sort of way.  The story itself could have been more cleverly written with a bit more intrigue but has way too many plot holes and improbable moments that really don't fit together very well.

There are a few too many quick mental flashes of the future that seem to be the primary story telling technique of the director.  It is a bit overdone in my opinion.  It seems to be to be trying too hard to be a Silence of the Lambs remake.  The background music also seemed a bit out of place at times.

Is this a terrible movie?  No, but it definitely could have been better with such a great cast.  It is too bad the story couldn't have been better written and directed.

3 stars",1489449600,,1191,4.339366515837104
7508957,3,B017NNN31Y,"Solace is a thriller starring Anthony Hopkins as clairvoyant John Clancy, who is enlisted by FBI Special Agent Joe Merriwether (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) when he is unable to solve a series of homicides. Merriwethers partner is Katherine Cowles (Abbie Cornish), an ambitious woman with a degree in psychology. Reminiscent of Hopkins Silence of the Lambs, Solace deals with a psychic working with law enforcement to track down a serial killer (Colin Farrell). When Clancy discovers that the killers victims have something very specific in common, the trio work furiously to stop the murderer before he strikes again. But the killer is always at least one step ahead at every turn.

Though the investigators travel from one crime scene to the next, and flashbacks feature grisly images of the crimes themselves, director Afonso Poyart fails to infuse these scenes with much excitement or suspense. He does create an atmosphere of gloom, but the films sluggish pace undermines it, reducing the movie to a routine murder mystery.

The most interesting character is Clancy, a one-time colleague of Merriwether who now, after a personal tragedy, lives as a recluse in a remote rural area. Hopkins Clancy has the gift of seeing what others cannot by touching them, but often he sees things he doesnt want to. That is the downside of his parapsychological talent. By assisting in the investigation, Clancy has visions which gradually put together the puzzle pieces of the serial crimes to find connections that can lead to the perpetrator.

Director Poyart overdoes the psychic story slant by using montages and special effects to illustrate the possible futures of many characters. Ultimately, its the game of cat and mouse between Clancy and the clever, but mad killer that serves as the films strongest plot line.

Bonus extras on the widescreen Blu-ray release include commentary with director Afonso Poyart, the featurette Visions and Voices: The Making of Solace, and a trailer gallery.",1489449600,,1979,5.175

Clancy soon discovers the connection that no one saw, but it also causes him to want to walk away. Clancy has finally met his match, and isn't entirely sure what to think, feel or do about it. I have said before I don't watch trailers for a movie if I can help it. That really benefited me in watching this movie. I absolutely loved this movie. It is a very different take on the standard catch a killer movie. There are enough aspects thrown in to make this fresh and new. The whole psychic aspect is down in a way that doesnt make it cheesy and really adds to the overall feel of the movie. The movie also has a little bit of a Boondock Saints aspect which really makes you think deeply about this movie more than you would if this was just a standard FBI detective film. Overall, every once in a while a movie comes out of nowhere, sucks you in and makes you think and feel things you weren't expecting. This is that movie. I loved and highly recommend this.

are killed by the same method.
Agent Joe Merriweather (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) decides to invite old friend and now reclusive analyst, now retired
John Clancy (Anthony Hopkins) to help with the Investigation that up now is going nowhere, with ambitious partner
Agent Katherine Cowles (Abbie Cornish) alongside they travel some 3 hours to see John who struggles with past events
in his own life, tells Joe from the outset says he's not interested,
However, Agent Cowles leaves files on the murders with John for him to check out, his curiosity is such he decides to
learn more by linking up with the Agents for the investigation.
John's psychic powers give him vivid visions of what has taken place leading him to realize the presence of a link not
previously identified.
This will ultimately lead him to the killer, trouble is, Charles Ambrose (Colin Farrell) who can see into the future appears
to be more than a match for John.
Can the man who claims his crime is mercy-killing be stopped.
A sometimes psychological tale which tells of how psychic 'John Clancy' unravels the clues leading to a face to face with
the killer.
Though, perhaps somewhat fanciful in it's story-line, the film is in my view well worth a watch.
Good cast-list.

7509044,1,B017NNN31Y,"So it use to be when Collin Farrell or Ben Affleck made a movie, you could bet your money it was going to be horrible.  Then Ben Affleck's movies got a lot better, Collin Farrell on the other hand...still terrible.  I was sad that I wasted both my time and money on this film.  I guess I got caught up in the mind trap that Anthony Hopkins didn't make stinkers;  that even when matched up with actors like Collin Farrell, he could still pull through, but alas, not even Hopkins can save this movie from it's cliche predictability and cascade of stumbling actor's performances.  Solace tries to be an intelligent thriller and succeeds at neither.  The movie's cardinal sin is that Afonso Poyart shamelessly steals ideas, motifs, and special effects from other movies.  Most  notably, Hopkins tries to recreate a ""Hannibal Lecter"" parallel tragic character afflicted with genius and intuitive crime fighting abilities.  Doesn't work.  Bullets fly across the scene with effects stolen from the Matrix.  Characters divide up and project multiple vectors like the Nicolas Cage movie Next.  None of this cinematic graft can make you forget this movie stinks, but at least it helps conjure memories from better movies, helping you to forget you just wasted money on Solace.  I could go on but why?  Save your money.  Walk your dog.  Go out to eat.  Play a board game with the kids.  Catch up on some sleep.  Stay away from this movie.

One notable highlight -  Afonso Poyart must have got professional consultation from a real SWAT team. The officers use legitimate techniques when clearing rooms/buildings, which was a nice break from the tactical ridiculousness of most Hollywood drivel.",1486080000,11,1682,4.914590747330961

However, I really liked this one because it was Anthony Hopkins 'not' playing a creepy role for a change.(Loved him in Hearts of Atlantis)  (lol) I'm terrible remembering some actors and actresses names, so forgive me. I also enjoyed the actor who played Joe. It helped put his persona in a different light other than his disgusting Negin role on The Walking Dead. I really thought he played his part quite well in this movie.
I didn't find the storyline hard to follow at all, but I did have to give it my complete attention because of the vision parts would happen so quickly. I found myself having to go back a few seconds in the movie to see what I missed.",1485561600,,699,4.4186046511627906

First off, the movie has some issues, but the issues have nothing to do with the actors.  They are all good actors.  In fact, individually each actor is great, in different scenes. However, even the greatest acting cannot shore up holes in the presentation of the material.  And to be clear, Abbie Cornish's performance was TERRIFIC!  First rate.  I truly don't understand why anyone would interpret her work as anything other than very good (perhaps someone is posting negative reviews of her work for other reasons - it happens in Hollywood all the time).  The movie is solid, and Abbie Cornish was a surprise in it; especially in her first big scene with Hopkins (very erotic - not something you usually get from Hopkins).

It starts out like a made for tv movie and the quality does not improved but Anthony Hopkins is a gift to cinema so there is that. Story is dumb and dumber by the minute.

I was also pleasantly surprised to find that Abbie Cornish was in this. Jeffrey Dean Morgan is also in it and that was originally another fact that made me hesitate; I've seen him in a few things and while he's very attractive he always seemed more like a 'type' than a real character - but in this he was fully formed.

I couldn't give it a full 5 star rating because I felt that Colin's character should have been developed more actually I found myself wanting to know more about all the characters but I understand that would make for a 10 hour movie, which is why I think this would have been an excellent tv series. I also did not care for the acting by Abbie Cornish as Agent Katherine Cowles. I not only didn't care for her I thought ""Why should I care for her?""  I found myself actually rooting for Colin Farrell's character more and I would have loved to know more about him. I know I'm not the only person that probably saw the irony.

7509230,2,B017NNN31Y,"It's one of those films where you watch the ending and say to yourself, ""Oh now I see where they trying to go with this"" and realizing they had missed their goal by a longshot. I thought Hopkins was good but two notably weak parts were Colin Farrell, Jeffrey Dean Morgan and especially Abbie Cornish. I've liked Farrell and Morgan in other things and would believe the weakness I perceived as something due to the writing/directing as their characters were very weak. Cornish was flat out awful; a ridiculous character. If Cornish does have any talent (her only other film that I've seen is Sucker Punch where I vaguely remember her, Limitless/Robocop where I don't remember her at all), it was too obscured by bad writing, directing and possibly editing to overcome the flaws there. This film, to me, qualifies as an interesting failure and a challenge to A) figure out where things went wrong and b) how could they have been better done. If you don't watch movies with such a critical eye, you ""might"" find it a little entertaining but it will not be a movie you rave about or remember 5 minutes after watching it.",1483920000,,1116,4.641414141414141

7509276,1,B017NNN31Y,"This is worse than bad television. I foolishly saw positive reviews for this on Amazon and threw away money on this pile of crap. Why does the camera need to awkwardly zoom in on the characters while they are talking? Is that supposed to create some visual movement to compensate for the lack of good plot movement? What's up with Anthony Hopkins's hair? Or Abbie Cornish's for that matter. I get that this is low budget but her awkward single process blonde color with the intensely tight updo and bad pantsuits from Express circa 2001 made me more uncomfortable than the ridiculous autopsy scene. Nice brain bros. Oh and what, Anthony Hopkins got an ominous fax and has to drop the case suddenly? a FAX? Are you kidding me? Oh and there's the obligatory hot nude chick scene... she's having a sexy striptease alone while drinking a glass of wine before climbing into a tub full of flowers (um, stargazer lilies? That's my first bathtub flower choice, because we all want yellow pollen all over the place). Totally normal. The field of stargazers directly adjacent to a dumpster... totally normal.
There's also the awkward elephant in the room throughout the whole movie. You know the one... Se7en. Let's see here.... murdered model with giant photos of herself on the wall... check. Rain, lots of rain. Two guys are eating from a food cart with unnecessary quantities of rain in the background... check. A killer who is sets up elaborate scenarios with cryptic messages for the detectives to solve, and this killer's identity remains a fascinating secret until nearly the end, and then puts the detectives in a really complicated damned if you do, damned if you don't situation. What's in the BOX?! Check.
Oh and this is cool, the psychic killer leads the detectives to an empty room with just a refrigerator in it, to lead them next door to a shady dude with a gun and a coffee cup covered in frogs. Anthony Hopkins randomly utters ""turpentine"" and sees the cup covered in frogs and says... ""Frogs""... because he saw this coming but couldn't put the pieces together! Anyhoo, this is an elaborate scheme to have Mr. detective shot by the shady frog cup guy in the line of duty so his family gets compensation, but he really has stage 4 cancer. But for some reason the detective survives the gunshot so he can have a tearful moment in the hospital, and later dies of... what, the cancer or the gunshot? Why doesn't the serial killer just shoot the detective himself? And why is shady frog cup guy answering the door with a gun and shooting cops? Just because he's a badass who likes frogs? It would have been way cooler if it was a cup with a photo of his pet cat on it. To be ironic. Like this bad mofo is a cat person, bet you didn't see that coming huh?!
And what is the half a bloody dress thing? What is the point of that segment at all? Just wanted to throw in a ""shocking"" visual of an artfully arranged murder (was someone murdered or was it just blood and a dress?) so you thought this was just like Silence of the Lambs?
Does my review seem like it's completely nonsensical, random, and a waste of your time? If so, then it's just like this movie. Just throw in some bewbs for no reason.
Oh, and don't think my questions imply that this movie is thought-provoking. The only thoughts this movie provoked are ""why did I click 'buy movie'"" when I should have done something else, anything else, with my time?",1483660800,20,3416,4.556097560975609

7509280,1,B017NNN31Y,"For the most part, this is a hackneyed, third or fourth choice film.

The positive points are: (mostly) good cinematography, editing, special effects and considering what the actors had to work with, the craft side of the acting was okay.

Unfortunately, the story and script were trash. Awful is not an adequate adjective.  Premise, plot, dramatic arc, intrigue, pathos, logic, plausibility and common sense are all zeroes. Watching this movie was more annoying than entertaining.",1483574400,3,481,5.386666666666667

7509291,2,B017NNN31Y,Poor acting,1483574400,,11,5.0
7509292,2,B017NNN31Y,"Abbie Cornish was atrocious. Her lines seemed read (from a standing position) and her emotional input phony. I kept wanting the director to halt filming while Cornish went to acting school. Ugh! Hopkins can deliver no imperfect role. I hope it's not the case that he's just hard-up for money that led him to this gigantic mistake. Like all great actors, he was in a cast that he had to carry most of the time. He did the best possible.
The plot concept was interesting but the nature of the dichotomy between the psychic and psychological approaches was fluffed over with single sentences instead of being explored in depth with meaningful conversation between Cornish and Hopkins. That, in fact, was the only interesting part of the entire film. The catchy little gimmicks to show the psychic ""revelations"" were often trite and the fundamental contradiction between ""revelation"" and intervention was left up for grabs and becomes the central point of the grand finale. So, Hopkins ""sees"" all these pieces of future events and says nothing because (implied, never stated) he cannot change the inevitable; the future is cast in stone, presumably. Okay. But then what's the point of bringing a psychic onto a case in the first place? If she/he can sense/see the future, they can see it beyond the point (if only a little bit beyond) of where the cops (with his help) catch and stop the bad guy. Then the future is altered by the intervention. If that's possible, why not just, for instance, tell/force Abbie to stay away from the subway until after the cops have shot have killed/captured Collin?
One last point: the way the script is set up, Hopkins can tune in his ""powers"" at will. Or maybe they're always turned on and he can't control that. At one point while he was walking along a street, I felt deeply sorry for him because it seemed that all had to do was look and concentrate and he would see the futures of everyone he looked at. Ugh again. Worse than reading a newspaper. I'm a writer, alas, and am perhaps more critical therefore than others. Check out my ""The Bell"" on Amazon.",1483574400,,2088,4.7076502732240435

7509306,5,B017NNN31Y,"Wow!  Poignant psychological-paranormal thriller.  Full of twists.  You will NOT see what's coming.  Every odd flashback or vision is tied into the narrative eventually.  Everything makes sense--eventually.  The dueling psychics are both amazing, both NOT what you initially think they are.

Frankly, we have a struggle between multiple ""good guys.""  Which ratchets up the tension nicely.  I could have watched another four hours with these characters.  Peering into their disparate lives, revealing secrets, was a pleasure.

The ending is, of course, a bittersweet twist.  Open enough to allow for sequels, but solid enough to extrapolate EXACTLY what will be going on in these characters' lives in the near future.  Weirdly beautiful.

Hopkins realizes that he has met his match when he sees that the person they are hunting has abilities similar to his, but much stronger.

But the movie could have benefited from a stronger story line and direction.  These are all topnotch actors in other films, so what happened here?

Yes, it's another come-out-of-retirement movie to get one last bad guy, but this time the serial killer has a motive you have never seen (at least I hadn't) and with an opposing strong performance by Colin Farrell, we're soon off into a discourse on life, death, pain, suffering, and mercy,  And of course the movie unlocks a wrenching secret from Hopkins' past  Young people may not get all he talk about death and dying, but if you're over 40, it will leave you thinking.  And there's plenty of action too. I'm a skeptic who doesn't believe in psychics, but if I suspend disbelief and follow the premise, it works.  Don't miss.",1482883200,5,901,4.54320987654321

7509479,5,B017NNN31Y,"Writers Sean Bailey and Ted Griffin combine talents again to give creative director Afonso Poyart a fine, intelligent and fast paced story that deals with not only psychic abilities but also the question of death and dying.

It is refreshing to find a film unafraid to explore the feelings of the terminal patient who may or may not wish to painful forego treatment of chronic illness that ultimately will end in death. It is a subject we tiptoe around in a manner we avoid the right to die or do not resuscitate decisions of fellow human beings. True, the concept is embedded in a story about serial murders, but listen carefully to the script and watch the permutations of visual field imagery in the main characters and be aware that there is a lot of philosophy being approached as well as drama.

A significant aspect of SOLACE (defined as to give comfort to in grief or misfortune, to console) is the presence of different forms of psychic gifts  clairvoyance, clairaudience, claircognizance and psychometric ability. The variations are interesting but attempting to explain the differences does not add considerably to the film.

In brief, a psychic doctor, John Clancy (Anthony Hopkins), works with FBI special agents Joe Merriwether (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) and Katherine Cowles (Abbie Cornish) in search of serial killer Charles Ambrose (Colin Farrell). After having lived in isolation for two years, since the death of his daughter, Dr. Clancy is asked by his friend Joe, an FBI special agent to help him solve several murders committed by a serial killer. The problem is that Ambrose is also psychic on a mission, and far ahead of Clancy. Add to the mix the personal histories of Joe and Katherine as well as Dr. Clancy and Charles Ambrose, each with their own association with tragic deaths, and the film comes to a polished climax.

Excellent main cast and including an outstanding supporting crew of actors, very fine cinematography by Brendan Galvin, musical score by BT, and exceptional special effects all well direction by Afonso Poyart make this a film very much worth experiencing.

7509482,5,B017NNN31Y,"Although others are reacting negatively to this film, I found it to be excellent. It has numerous plot twists and also significant moral undertones.  I find it unfair to expect ALL movies starring Sir Anthony Hopkins to be a ""Silence of the Lambs.""  Which is what I see across so many recent reviews of his movies. This movie is excellent on it's own due to the writing, acting, subplots and each actors portrayal.  I found it well worth the rental and will watch it again as I am wondering what foreshadowing I missed.  Excellent on many levels, much like a well written novel.",1482451200,159,578,4.58252427184466
7509483,4,B017NNN31Y,"I liked it, but it could have been much bettet. It is a shame Farrell and Hopkins don't have more scenes together. They could have. Except for J. D. Morgan, all have played in the same films ay least once beforre. Abbie Cornish plays Colin Farrell's wife in ""Seven Psychopaths"", in which Sam Rockwell stole the show. Hopkins and Farrell were both in ""Alexander"", although Hopkins was the narrator to Farrell  playing in the starring role of Oliver Stone's not  disasterously bloated film. It was stlll worth the watch.",1482451200,3,518,4.808988764044944
7509484,3,B017NNN31Y,"An okay entertainment, if you like X-Filesish stories, but no biggie. It's a supernatural thriller that often walks a fine line between the weird and the ridiculous. A psychic helps the FBI look for a serial killer, etc. etc. It takes quite a while to get to the point and really get rolling, and then, despite a high level of the preposterous, it's pretty fun. You won't be quite sold on all the mystic hoodoo, and the cast doesn't seem to be either. Hopkins, Morgan, Cornish and the late-arriving Colin Farrell all stroll through their parts. The director and the writers add layers of folderol in an apparent attempt to convince you there's more going on here than really does. Wouldn't have wanted to spend movie theater money on it, but for home viewing it passes the time okay.",1482451200,3,783,4.640287769784172
7509485,3,B017NNN31Y,"This movie is getting too high on the ratings scale, so i'm throwing in my two cents. It is not very good. Anthony Hopkins is always compelling to watch, but it is not enough to save this hot mess. There is no thrilling reveal at the end, no great twist of plot. It is simply a poorly written script with a few cheap thrills. I have seen several mediocre films lately with big stars - I suppose everyone needs to stay busy, or get paid. This film is not worth the price of the rental, so wait for it to come out as a ""free view.""",1482451200,2,529,4.0

After several years of watching Anthony Hopkins in movies that were disappointing, this met my expectations of his marvelous acting as a gifted man who aids the police with his psychic abilities to ""feel"" and ""see"", to help solve difficult cases. I can't fail to mention the supporting cast of fine acting, and a plot that left me breathless as I waited for, and got spine tingling suspense and action. There are some shocking revelations, secrets revealed, and a deep look at mercy killings. Bravo, Sir Anthony!",1482364800,,684,4.956521739130435

I am not sure how they were able to get Hopkins to act in this mess.  If you are looking for a serial killer type of movie like sev7n or silence of the lambs, this is not for you.  Its a weird low budget psychic movie that several good actors try to pull off, with a terrible plot and character development.  Overall poor editing and low effort.  It felt at times like they cut out scenes or didn't bother shooting scenes.  I wonder if their budget was cut and they rewrote the movie half way.
