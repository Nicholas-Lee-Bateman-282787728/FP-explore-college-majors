8285794,5,B001C3O6S6,"After renting this from the library several times, we bought this DVD for my son for Christmas. It is very corny and looks like in was made in the early 1990s, but my 3 year old son absolutely loves this DVD.  It keeps him entertained for hours and loves to sing along to the songs. This is great for a toddler.",1342828800,2,311,4.098360655737705
