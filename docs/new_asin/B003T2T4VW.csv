4190099,4,B003T2T4VW,"This film, based on a play, treats the subject of the dynamics of a gay family.  A gay couple is having problems.  One member of the couple has a son he does not know about.  The son comes to stay with him and his lover for a while.  Tensions build as the couple and the son learn to cope with one another and with their problems.  The film tells a very solid story with characters that are honest.  They are never ""jerks.""

The acting is sometimes over the top for film -- it is more appropriate for a play.  Nevertheless, the story is a good one and I found myself crying as the characters begin to care more and more for one another.  The film is that raw emotionally.  In spite of my tears, I do not think this film is a ""tear jerker.""

Though it has flaws, I recommend this film for anyone interested in gay family dynamics.",1305936000,6,829,4.150943396226415

The story is first rate.  The acting is very good to excellent.  The emotions run deep and I felt it.",1286150400,3,310,4.754716981132075
4190102,4,B003T2T4VW,"Den is the closeted star of a long-running TV network series, who secretly shares his Hollywood Hills home with his much-younger lover, Colin, a former dancer who is in a wheelchair following an accident. Their domestic bliss is disturbed by the arrival of 16 year old David, who announces that he is Den's son, triggering the older man's memory of a drugged-out affair he had back then.  Now living with his grandmother Winnie, David left the home of his alcoholic stepfather.  Unfortunately, David is quite homophobic, and has a problem relating to his father's choice of life partner.  This becomes an issue later, when Winnie takes ill and David has to move in with the couple.  It's a slow transition to acceptance, and they have to deal with David's ""growing pains,"" which seem to include a same-sex fling with a rumored gay teen idol. Ultimately, David's presence has a positive effect in ways not foreseen.

The film was co-written by Travis Michael Holder (who also plays Den), and is generally a good effort, despite a few distracting tangents.  The brightest spot is the excellent acting, especially from John Brotherton (""One Life To Live"") as Colin and Luke Eberl as David.  Also good to see character actress Mary Jo Catlett (who many may remember as the housekeeper in ""Different Strokes"") who plays Winnie.  Former Miss USA Deborah Shelton also has a role as Junie, a fellow actress and Den's apparent confidant, although - in my opinion - she adds nothing to the film.  My one beef: the sound is poor in several scenes, making the lines difficult to hear.  Overall, this is an amusing and positive tale about ""the family we create for ourselves,"" and I give it four stars out of five.",1285632000,2,1701,4.794520547945205

It tells a powerful story about the rather large and illustrious closet that continues to trap and ensnare many within the various show business mediums (e.g., film, television, music).  Despite the many accomplishments of openly gay folks within these respective industries, we continue to hear countless stories from entertainers who report having been told ""you'll never make it big if you choose to come out...""

4190138,3,B003T2T4VW,"While it's production values are okay, the ""framing"" of the sequences by the camera look like some films in the early days of Cinemascope where there was lots of wasted screen space. The acting is good even if the casting is from a limited pond. This film is about an actor and his wheelchair ridden lover who have their life turned upside down when the actor's son created during a drunken mistake appears at their door. The script looks as if it might have been originally intended for the stage. There are a couple of involving scenes. This was a decent stab at a crossover movie striving to be more meaningful than the typical gay movie. There are fortunately no sex scenes, just family drama where the gay parents are just a springboard for the characters to evolve. I gave it an extra star for trying.",1411689600,,807,4.534246575342466
4190139,4,B003T2T4VW,"A good drama. It would be well suited to a stage play. Pretty well all acted out on the one set. I thought the drama was well acted and held your interest. If you are after good looking nude or semi nude bodies you will not get it in this film with only one physically attractive guy in the  cast (the guy in the wheelchair!). The plot is not deep but if you appreciate a drama, watch this film. I liked all the characters portrayed in the film.",1410998400,,445,4.056818181818182
4190140,1,B003T2T4VW,"Never heard of this movie before, but I figured I would give it a shot since it seemed to have decent reviews. Apparently, this movie was adapted from a play that I had never heard of.

I've seen a decent amount of gay cinema, but this one was just terrible. The little, spoiled, bratty, ignorant, self-centered, know it all, self-pitying child was a little too much for me but I held out as long as I could. I almost just stopped watching it but I finished the movie. The ending just sort of happens with an epiphany and all the adults cater to the child and I suppose they live a happy little life together after this small little chapter in their lives. Utter garbage. I would not recommend this to anyone who enjoys gay cinema.",1408752000,,731,4.375
4190141,4,B003T2T4VW,"Most low budget gay movies are complete crap, where they clearly aren't trying very hard to put out a quality product.  This one is an exception.  It's clearly a labor of love.  The writing and acting are mostly very good, and the plot is interesting.  It's not without its faults, however.  The audio sometimes suffers from bad microphone practice.  The direction and acting are sometimes more suited to stage than screen (verging on melodramatic).  But these problems are easily overlooked in exchange for the opportunity to watch a good quality gay movie.",1408320000,3,558,5.0

The story develops with many conflcits, the boy ealing with an unexpected encounter with a young gay actor.

I thought it was a very powerful and very well acted movie. The actor that played the son....wow. He acted with such emotion. The fact that he did not have a great life growing up was very apparent. Such raw emotion coming from this young actor..wow..blew me away. You can't blame the father for not being there for his son growing up, because he did not know he had a son.
I like how the story progressed, the son starting to open up..and starting to trust....grasping at anything that might resemble a family for him.
While not a tear jerker, I found myself with a few tears.

There is no nudity, and what sex there is is only talked about (but not in graphic detail).  The language is adult, but not offensive.  The scenery and the shots of the ocean from Malibu are really pretty transistions between the scenes.

So much of what passes as popular gay films is either incredibly silly or completely out of touch with gay life that has nothing to do with Los Angeles or New York City. When this film started and I saw that the main character was an actor, I almost turned the thing off. The opening with the bitchy female was so typical of what a lot of gay movies feel are defining aspects of everyone's gay lifestyle. Not so. Again, I was tempted to turn the movie off. But, I kept watching. Sometimes the dialogue was unnatural and forced. Had this been a big Hollywood film, the script would have been more polished than it was. But, the film gained traction with me when serious social issues that everyone can relate to started being talked about with a sincerity and seriousness that did not happen in the earlier part of the film. Yes, the script could have been more professional, the acting of a higher quality. But, the manner in which the film played out in the end made what went before endurable. No nudity. No sex for the sake of playing to the lowest common denominator of viewers. No incredibly unrealistic characters. Yes, the female actress was  hardly relatable. But, that was OK given how the film pulled itself together at the end.",1520726400,,1626,4.42

8404950,5,B003T2T4VW,"Quite a different gay themed film, but I suspect you would either love it or hate it.
One person wrote ""manufactured angst,"" but t is a FILM, and the topics were handled very well, and the acting only slightly overdone. Surprising film and satisfying ending.
Very different from what one might expect in a film where a gay Dad finds out he has a 16 year old son.  Not the ""traditional"" plot line, but mush better.  A real angsty story with a happy ending.",1517961600,,455,4.404761904761905

8404953,5,B003T2T4VW,"This was one of the most enjoyable and heart warming gay themed movies I have ever seen. and I have seen quite a few of them. it was refreshing to see a REAL story put forth for once, not some cliche of what it is to be gay. It showed that being gay does not mean one is not human, that one does not have the same problem, wishes, wants as anyone else. strip away the fact that 2 of the principal characters are gay, and you have a story that could be anyone, anywhere at anytime. this is the best that I have ever seen in this genre. thank you for writing this, directing this and making this. oh and the best part? the actors can ACT!!!",1501891200,,638,3.9921875
8404954,4,B003T2T4VW,"I really liked the movie...however I thought the actor playing Den was miscast...the character was supposed to be a closeted lead actor...but he came across as obviously gay (Liberace had more people fooled!  lol).  It took me a while to remember where I knew Mary Jo Catlett from...it was nice to see her again!

The movie had a nice message to it.  Reminds me of a low budget Lifetime(ish) movie.  It was enjoyable.",1489795200,,417,4.657534246575342
