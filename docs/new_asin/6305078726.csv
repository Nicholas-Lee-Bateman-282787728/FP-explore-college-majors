7882644,5,6305078726,"What a treasure this La Scala Cosi continues to be these many years hence! SIX principal singers who are actually Musicians! A conductor so rooted in the warming sunlight of Mozart that his work here is as natural and vital as breathing, capped by a subtly elegant set design by gifted Mauro Pagano! And finally, a perfect score that will outlast time itself! Wow! What is there to criticize?

I never 'upgraded' my double VHS set to dubious dvd land. Luckily, apparently, given the whining on these review pages. I'm suspicious of audio-/videophiles in general, since rarely are they musicians who even reasonably understand the performance, let alone the MUSIC! they pontificate about. My VHS tapes continue to play splendidly (heroically, evidently!) after many runs through the old machine. What a capper to read you can purchase a single 'new' dvd version here for $205, or you can check out a 'used and/or new' VHS version beginning at $3.62. Sheeesh!... you'd think the seller who wants to unload his Cosi dvd for $200+ would at least have read the reviews claiming the transfer from VHS is something akin to degrading the human race. Ah...the sentient businessman!

If you want to experience probably the finest filmed version of Mozart's ensemble masterpiece, do yourself a real deal and pop for a VHS version offered by amazon sellers before they go extinct. You'll have purchased a bit of heaven, and THAT's the truth.",1261958400,3,1429,4.95
7882645,5,6305078726,"The sets are wonderful, as one expects from La Scala. There is not one weak voice in the cast. You will love Despina. What can I say?  Mozart reigns.",997660800,12,149,4.137931034482759
7882646,1,6305078726,"I have listened to over 600 different opera recordings in my lifetime on video and if I had to choose a video that had the worst sound quality and the worst balance of sound recording between voices and orchestra, this  would be the one.  This, like many opera dvds, was not a recording produced  exclusively for dvd, but rather, a dvd recording re-recorded onto vhs with  added menus and special effects.  Muti is an excellent conductor and the  emotion sparkles in this production but my ears were left straining to hear  the notes of Mozart's beautiful opera.  Avoid this recording like the  plague and don't say that I didn't warn you.  If you want a good recording  of Cosi Fan Tutti to listen to, (I'm still looking for a good video  recording) buy Georg Solti's recording with Michele Pertusi singing bass.  You'll love it, I promise!",956707200,25,841,4.678082191780822
7882647,5,6305078726,"It's important to realize what we have here. A very sophisticated performance musically, full of vitality, beautiful orchestral playing, and six superb soloists in roles that suit them well. Riccardo Muti is one of  the leading Mozart conductors of the day, and his perfectionist and stylish  approach, serving the composer totally, is an absolute delight.  The  production is stylistic, and pretty to look at. The live performance has an  electricity which is captivating.  10 out of 10 !",953078400,19,489,5.205128205128205
7882648,2,6305078726,"Muti's performance is acceptably""Mozartian""- and the singers do justice to the roles. The production is what one might call ""opera house standard.""
However, the video rendition is atrocious - perhaps  the translation from European to American video standards was ""too  much"" - the images are ""jumpy"" and erratic- it's distracting  in the extreme. Turn off the monitor and listen to the performance.",941500800,27,398,5.387096774193548
