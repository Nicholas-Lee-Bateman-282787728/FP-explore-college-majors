8542175,5,B009J5D644,"This is a very funny, not-for-kids ""mockumentary"" done in the style of a ""making of"" behind-the-scenes film. What makes it so funny is that, well, it's *funny*, but also because it takes a seemingly deadly serious approach to the making of those Yule Log videos. You know the ones - the videos that people play on their TVs or computers to add a bit of ambiance and holiday cheer when they don't actually have a fireplace. Those videos harken back to the Yule Log tv show that was traditionally played in the NYC area on Christmas or Christmas Eve for decades, and since expanded to several stations around the country. It's amazing to think that a video of a log burning in a fireplace was such a huge ratings hit, but it was; and now, for the making-of!

See the agony of the director as the crew tries desperately to light the log. See the extremely-not-for-kids reveal of the manger. See the transvestite Santa. No, seriously - see the transvestite Santa!

This is a short film - about 30 minutes long - and would make a great stocking stuffer or fun gift for someone with a sense of humor.

There's some swearing, and the content is not for kids. It's also not at all suitable for your deeply religious grandmother.

Can I link to the trailer as part of a review? I'm going to try. This is the trailer, so you can get a flavor of the film:
