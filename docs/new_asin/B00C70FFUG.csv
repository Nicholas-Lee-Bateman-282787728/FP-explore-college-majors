5692280,5,B00C70FFUG,"I purchased the Blu-Ray and as mentioned by others it is 4:3 and PCM but fortunately my plasma has an option to adjust the picture size (p-size button) to a wider setting so you can get rid of the black bars altogether.  I also have a Bose so that took care of the PCM for me.  Even if you do not have those features it is still worth purchasing just to hear the gorgeous voices and acting by all in their prime.  The setting is lovely.  The picture on the Blu-Ray admittedly is not Blu-Ray 2013 quality since it was recorded with older equipment but 99% of the time it is perfect.  Occasionally the sun streams into the church so there is a ""slight"" haze but I found the picture quality to be very good.  For $16.60 this Blu-Ray was an absolute bargain.",1381708800,16,754,4.2377622377622375
5692281,5,B00C70FFUG,This recording is so special because it was filmed in the actual locations in Rome. It brings the story to life not only with beautiful singing but with the atmosphere as well.,1377129600,5,176,4.53125
5692282,5,B00C70FFUG,"I loved it! To see the original locations for this opera was far better than any stage production. An excellent production on all counts. I found the singing and music outstanding. I was glued to the TV screen for each act. I have seen other production but never in authentic settings. So truly visual. When Scarpia, at the end of the first act, kisses the robe of the Holy Father and raises his eyes upward, I could clearly see his lust for Tosca. The juxtaposition of his evil in the house of God was the beginning of his downfall. Tosca's courage in the face of such evil demonstrated the strength of her character. I found similar courage by Madama Butterfly.

I could go on, but enough.",1376092800,13,691,4.484126984126984
5692283,5,B00C70FFUG,"Unfortunate that Amazon chooses to combine reviews of blu-ray and DVD versions of operas.

The blu-ray copy I received opened on a top menu with just a blank blue bar with no means of selecting options or any way to make it play.  Pity.  I've owned this version on laserdisc and potentially the best version out there.  Was really looking forward to having this.  Other caveat, the box that it came in states that it is remastered in high definition from the original master tape.  So, potentially good picture. But would not be wide screen nor HD sound.  Still, would be worth having if they solve problem of opening menu and ability to play!

Be very clear that my review is (was) of the blu-ray version.  I've returned the blu-ray disc and have ordered the DVD.

Update 8/19/2013. Received the DVD version.  Apparently the blu-ray and DVD both are old style 4:3 aspect ratio and PCM sound.  Lacking HD sound, 5.1 surround and wide-screen.  So even if you can get a blu-ray that plays, no benefit in buying.  Thanks for clarification from other reviewers and those who have commented.  Nonetheless, possibly the best performance given the principals, direction and settings.  So worth having.  Just not technically what I had hoped for!

Update 9/19/2014.  Just watched, listened to Malfitano's Vissi D'Arte once again.  Compared to other video versions including Callas's (yes the Callas Act II of Tosca does exist on video)I find the Malfitano version works best for me. Vocally and dramatically.  She really is quite special!",1374624000,35,1530,4.8984375
5692284,5,B00C70FFUG,Best possible Tosca to invest your money in. Features the actual locales and time of day for the scenes in the original opera. Performances are superb!,1452124800,,151,4.846153846153846
5692285,5,B00C70FFUG,"This opera of Puccini's is especially unique because Tosca is in a live setting in Rome with the Tiber River flowing along.

5692288,3,B00C70FFUG,"In spite of this being a Blu-ray disc, the quality is substantially lower than any Blu-ray I have ever seen. 4:3 and PCM!!!  On screen text shows the sound is 5.1, but it clearly isn't coming through the rear speakers. I will need to adjust sound to compensate in order to bring sound to rear speakers. I think that even if I do, it will be only 2.1. Not sure about center speaker. So, we end up with a lovely setting that has reduced clarity in both visual and audio quality.  Did any ask Placido Domingo if he minded a low-quality product? I certainly do. Even the plastic case is cheap, thin, and flimsy. It was fortunate to have made it through our equally wonderful USPS system. Lastly, in spite of its poor quality, I will; keep it. I would not have purchased it if I had known in advance of its quality.",1439424000,2,810,4.287581699346405

5692292,5,B00C70FFUG,"I really enjoyed watching this 1996 recording of ""Tosca"", filmed in the actual Roman locations where the action took place.  Placido Domingo, then about 55 years of age, is a credible Caravadossi and apparently never gives a bad performance. His Tosca- Catherine Malfitano- is beautiful to watch and to hear. She, too, is a very good actor. I love everything about this recording; so if you can accept the tragic story line, you will probably love it, too.",1419379200,3,456,4.846153846153846

5692294,5,B00C70FFUG,"A big problem with some operas, even really great ones, is the tendency for the experience to become rote. In other words, the story line is already familiar, the music is embedded, more or less in memory and so instead of really experiencing the music/drama, it seems to slip by, interrupted by a few, expected big arias that may or may not register fully. Sadly, I had been for years slowly losing my Tosca to familiarity. The downside of media is overexposure. And then I discovered this DVD and it was as though I was seeing Tosca for the first time. The authentic settings, the filming that allowed the settings to become an integral part of the drama, the singing, the acting, orchestra, etc., all came together to honor the story and Puccini.",1416787200,13,749,4.639097744360902

5692299,5,B00C70FFUG,"This is the premier recording of Tosca, in my opinion.  I saw it originally on television and loved it.  Domingo at his best.  Then I went to Rome and visited the three sites at which the opera was recorded, the church, Scarpia's office and the Castle where Cavaradossi was executed and Tosca jumped to her death.

5692303,2,B00C70FFUG,"When I ordered the Blu Ray version I expected it would be the film directed by de Bosio but in Blu Ray. It is not. The one I received is a Blu Ray copy of the Andrea Andermann TV production. It is very inferior to the de Bosio film. The Andermann version is small-screen and is compromised by the sounds of the helicopter presumably used in filming. Moreover,  the performances by an older Domingo and Malfitano do not measure up to the earlier version by a more youthful Domingo and Kabaivanska.",1400803200,2,496,4.450549450549451

This is suppose to be a blu-ray and I have movies in blu-ray from 1930s movies looking 10 times better than this disc. It is clearly in 480p and only the subtitles are in 1080p. Wish amazon.com would pull this item off the shelf because the seller is not honest and reliable. In the future, if I see anything produced by Kultur Video  I'm going to look for another label no matter the cost.

5692308,2,B00C70FFUG,"I prefer the film adaptation of Tosca starring Angela Gheorghiu and Roberto Alagna (directed by Benoit Jacquot) over this Malfitano / Domingo recording, based on two factors.

1. My opinion is that Angela Gheorghiu sings the role of Tosca better than Catherine Malfitano, and Gheorghiu is a much better actress.  (Gheorghiu delivers an inimitable portrayal of Tosca as a diva.)

2. Dont be fooled by the fact that this Malfitano / Domingo recording is Blu-ray.  The video is not high resolution, and it is not widescreen format  youll have either black bars on the sides, or a distorted image to make it fill an HDTV screen.  The bigger problem is the poor quality cinematography.  This recording looks like an amateur video vs. a professional film.  If you expect production standards associated with a Hollywood film, you will likely be disappointed with this video.  Even though the Gheorghiu / Alagna film is DVD format vs. Blu-ray, in my opinion it is visually superior to this Malfitano / Domingo video.  (I have no problem with the visual gimmicks in the Gheorghiu / Alagna film that some opera traditionalists dislike.)  I also prefer the audio quality of the Gheorghiu / Alagna film.",1387497600,6,1192,4.939698492462312

5692311,5,B00C70FFUG,"Glad this finally is out on DVD.  Have had to watch the tape until it is worn out.  Domingo had a cold and it shows a bit in his breathing but otherwise he sang beautifully as did Malfitano.  This followed the movie by Domingo about 25 years hence and he sounded as good as in the original film.  Filmed at the places and times of Puccini's score with Zubin about 4 miles away in a warehouse with the orchestra.  The feat was broadcast to many, many countries in real time and was an event then - the U. S. wasn't one of them as we are known for not appreciating opera in the rest of the world.  Probably sad, but true.  This is one of the best out on DVD, along with the original filmed version and the new one from Covent Garden with Angela, Kaufmann and Terfel.",1384732800,10,764,4.121621621621622
5692312,5,B00C70FFUG,"This on location performance incorporates great opera, great singers and outstanding performances into the Roman setting used by Puccini.  I have the CDs and a videotape of this performance and am delighted that it has finally arrived on DVD.  Raimondi is the greatest Scarpia and Malfitano/Domingo are the perfect Tosca/Cavarradossi couple.",1384473600,2,341,5.666666666666667
5692313,5,B00C70FFUG,"This is an interesting take on ""Tosca"" in that it was filmed at the times of day in which the story unfolds.  The opening helicopter shot as it circles Rome in the morning fog as it descends onto the actual church where the story begins.
The opera unfolds in royal and regal splendor with spectacular sets and costumes and an unseen orchestra that will pull your socks up and your pants down!
The Second ACT is spectacular in that it was actually shot in the palace where the action was supposed to have taken place.
The Third ACT is powerful in that you are actually witnessing the action on the roof of the fortress.
Singing is (naturally) spectacular with the orchestra's booming in the backgrounds.
I highly recommend this for an unusual experiencing this ""GRAND OPERA"" produced brilliantly in 'todays' knowledge . . . no camera tricks or dubbing to be seen.",1383004800,25,862,4.671052631578948
8577866,5,B00C70FFUG,"I bought this film (yes, it is a film produced for TV) after visiting Rome las month and going to the three sites were the story unfolds, Church of St. Andrea della Valle, Palazzo Farnese and Castel St. Angelo.  They are at walking distance from each other.  Once back home watched the film. I was not disappointed, to the contrary, I felt much closer to it.  This film was done in 1992, the image is 4x3, and the sound is Stereo only, but doesnt diminish the thrill much. Even after watching and hearing many versions of Tosca, this felt closer and I could relate to it even more. There are many ways opera can be produced so it is easy to relate and enjoy. Domingo and the full cast gave us one way and it succeeded with me. I can just hope that other artists will dare experiment with all kind of new technologies and concepts out there to produce operas that we experience, enjoy and marvel every time.",1525219200,,906,4.349112426035503
8577867,1,B00C70FFUG,"I clicked ""Multi-Format"" thinking it was just that. However it is strictly Blu-Ray and completely useless to me. I don't know why they didn't label the options as such i.e ""DVD"" and ""Blu-Ray"".",1501459200,,192,4.848484848484849
8577868,3,B00C70FFUG,"I found this production strangely disappointing and it took awhile to realize why. First, the positives--the music is wonderful, the singing is great, the idea of an opera built around a political turning point of modern Italy I love (could live without the anticlericalism, but such is life). Domingo is his usual magnificent self. All that you would love about Tosca is there = 3 stars.

But. The downfall is the mix of present and past. Verismo set in 1800 => keep helicopters off the set. Each entr'acte looks like the intro credits to M*A*S*H with crazy Roman traffic, plus  the wupwupwup of the motor. Maybe Tosca's suicide was painless? A camera on board shows close ups Sant'Andrea della Valle, the Palazzo Farnese, and Castel Sant'Angelo. But this is overkill--we already knew the setting. That's why we're watching *this* Tosca. The helicopter's purpose seems to be to hit the viewer over the head with that fact. The helicopter shots would be great for a 1960s Italian detective movie. Here they're a verismo neutron bomb, destroying all your ability to imagine Rome in 1800.

Further, this version was recorded on video tape. The medium simply looks cheesy. The alternative echt-verismo production of Tosca is the one with Domingo (of course), Kabaivanska (every bit the Tosca that Malfitano was here, maybe less stunningly attractive), and an even sleazier Scarpia in Sherrill Milnes, still in his full voice.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Puccini-Tosca/dp/B001F1XDXE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Puccini: Tosca</a>&nbsp;used film and is much richer for it.

Malfitano was probably the best actress of all the operatic stars I have seen, and she is superb as Floria Tosca.  Domingo is also an excellent Mario.  Having it staged in the actual locations is also wonderful and brings a special element to the production.
