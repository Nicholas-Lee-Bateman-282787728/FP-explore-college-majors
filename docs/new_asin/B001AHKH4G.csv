3448059,5,B001AHKH4G,"I loved this DVD.  I loved learning more about this gifted artist.  His music is wonderful and uplifting.  You will love it if you loved gospel music. His song ""If you could see her thrugh my eyes"" sung to his wife made me cry.  It was very uplifting.  I love the song Gonna Wake Up Dancin' and Gordon does such a wonderful job singing it.  He is truly a very gifted artist who has not let his handicap stop him and bringing good music to others.",1304467200,,446,4.127906976744186
3448060,5,B001AHKH4G,"At our house we have disconnected television to avoid the mental and spiritual pollution emanating from it.  So for our hour of evening relaxation, we buy DVD's to watch:  railroad videos, ""The World at War"" (all 44 hours!), and the recently discovered Bill Gaither DVD's, featuring knee-slapping and otherwise enjoyable gospel music.

Their greatest weakness is the churchy doctrine inevitably woven throughout, by the very nature of so many of the songs.

Their greatest strength is that somehow the Spirit overcomes that, if one is careful to recognize the trap of doctrine.  Bill Gaither is a master at super productions that are refreshing, lively, an antidote to our troubling current state of affairs.

I bought Gordon Mote's DVD because I had seen him in other productions, and I loved what I saw of him.  He has a cheerful spirit and does not seem to let his blindness hinder him at all.  That victorious spirit is contagious and truly inspiring.

This DVD was more than I had hoped.  The setting is Bill Gaither ""interviewing"" Gordon, showing past performances and some right on the spot.  The viewer is made to feel included in the family and touched by the Spirit.",1274745600,,1176,4.888888888888889
3448061,5,B001AHKH4G,"The great thing about the ""Best of"" Gaither series is that you get to know the person.  Bill or Gloria Gaither will interview the performer and you learn a lot.  There is plenty of conversation and good music in this 2008 DVD.  Bill interviews Homecoming keyboardist, Gordon Mote, blind since birth who sits at the piano and intermittingly sings or we will see various clips of his work, plus some clips with the Homecoming Friends.

Gordon Mote has been associated with country musicians for a long time.  He shares with Bill about the decision to come onboard to join the Homecoming Friends.  I learned he has a brother who is also blind.  He will share some stories of the songs and musicians.  He will also do imitations of his  friend Porter Wagoner.  Mote's family joins him at the piano, his mother, children, and of course, the inspiration for ""If They Could See Her Through My eyes"", his wife.  The bonus clips are of Gordon shooting hoops.

Some of the gospel songs he does:  Old Gospel Ship; Give the World a Smile;  Maplewood Methodist; Church in the Wildwood; Don't Let Me Miss the Glory;  Ain't Gonna Give Up on God; I Catch `em, God Cleans `em;  Jesus Loves Me;  Get Up in Jesus Name.

Excellent Show......Rizzo",1273795200,5,1226,4.623255813953488
