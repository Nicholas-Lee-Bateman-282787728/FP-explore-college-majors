4018521,5,B002ZG98L4,"Piranha 3-D raises the bar for modern B-movie camp. In the style of the Creature feature, i.e. Jaws, Tremors, and Roger Corman's original cult classic ""Piranha"", Piranha 3-D finds our characters forced to contend with deadly prehistoric fish set loose by seismic disturbances on some un-expecting spring breakers. What stands out here is the over the top nudity and gore, in that order. Needless to say this movie is not for children, but for those of us adults who enjoy raunchy fun, look no further. The cast includes; Elizabeth Shue as local sheriff, Christopher Lloyd as town fish expert, Jerry O'Connell as a Girls Gone Wild filmmaker, Richard Dreyfus as opening victim and a slew of porn star extras. This movie delivers what you'd expect from a movie called Piranha and so much more.

So long as the Blu-ray version includes the 3-D glasses, consider this purchase a done deal.",1282435200,2,884,4.8933333333333335
4018522,4,B002ZG98L4,"Sometimes when you watch a film, you can't help but look back, stare at the screen, and wonder to yourself, ""Did I really see that?!""

Piranha 3-D can best be described as, ""Like Jaws, only with lots of tiny little fish that tear people to shreds in all sorts of nasty ways.""  If you've seen any shark/killer fish movie, you know how this goes.  Killer aquatic beasties descend upon a helpless town and proceed to tear apart the visitors whom the locals rely upon for money.  But in the face of certain death, the authorities and local experts band together and embark upon a race against time to save the day.

If I had to sum up ""Piranha 3-D"" in one word, it would be, ""Insane.""  This is a movie that cuts loose (literally) and doesn't hold anything back, wallowing in an orgy of naked bodies, breasts, bikinis, killer fish, gallons of blood, and some truly gruesome scenes of carnage that would make even hardened horror fans wince.  And yet...you can clearly tell the cast and crew knew they were doing a B movie, and decided to have fun with it.  They're clearly having a good time, and as a result, the entire film has a great sense of playfulness to it.  There are some truly wonderful moments that I won't dare spoil, except to say that the opening scene has a brilliant cameo with PERFECT music to go along with it, and there's an underwater sequence that features the GREATEST use of classical music I have ever seen in a film.  It's so perfect and charming you can't help but smile.

Don't forget however, that this is an R rated film, and it's NOT for kids.  In fact, I'm downright surprised the movie didn't get an X rating, as I've never seen so much nudity before in a film.  Women gleefully take off their clothes at every opportunity, and at one point, you see two naked teens for almost a minute straight, where EVERYTHING is visible (there's even a lengthy moment involving the male genitalia).  It's shocking how this much nudity made it into the film, along with so much bloody carnage, with skin ripped off, limbs shredded to the bone, etc.

If I had any problems with ""Piranha 3-D"", it's that I was very disappointed with the ending, as the movie ends the very second the climax is supposed to start.  It feels like we're watching a film that's only 85% done.  The 3-D, regrettably, is very mixed.  It works in some scenes, but most of the time it isn't very good, and there are some moments where the depth perception feels wrong, and it really doesn't add anything to the film overall.

In the end, ""Piranha 3-D"" is a B movie that goes completely and utterly nuts in having fun in its own gory, fleshy way.  If you can handle all the nudity and gore, have a fondness for B movies that don't take themselves seriously at all, and can tolerate the very abrupt and disappointing ending, then this is one of the most viscerally fun films you'll see all year.",1282348800,,2879,4.458015267175573
4018523,5,B002ZG98L4,"Welcome to Spring Break at Lake Victoria! This year the college students have alot more to worry about than hangovers or STDs. A massive underwater earthquake opens up a mysterious chasm, releasing an ancient swarm of psychotic little fish. These little buggers are super hungry.

Let me just say that hot naked chicks make great fish food. This movie has a ridiculous amount of nudity and the most immaculate gore you'll likey ever see in 3-D! Seriously, these piranha can chomp through human flesh like a lawnmower through grass. Any appendages dipping into the water get instantly devoured down to the bone. Everywhere you look there are chunks of bloody arms, mangled legs, or human carcasses floating around. This has some gruesome effects that are great sick fun. Really it's an absurd, catastrophic mess.

To top off the awesome gore and plethora of topless women, we have a nice ensemble cast providing a good dose of comedy. Jerry O'Connell is especially hilarious as a sleazy porn director. Christopher Lloyd (Back to the Future) also does great. Elizabeth Shue, Ving Rhames, and several others lead the way. Eli Roth has a small role. Richard Dreyfuss even makes an appearance in a bit of a Jaws homage. Way too fun!

Director Alexandre Aja struck gold with this one. Piranha 3-D lives up to the hype and then some. It does have some minor flaws and/or cliched developments, but still it was the funnest time I've had in the theater in quite awhile. Don't miss it!",1282348800,96,1475,4.822134387351778
4018524,5,B002ZG98L4,"Saw the movie yesterday and i liked it! The movie had pretty good effects, good acting, and some awesome killing scenes. Can't wait for this to be released soon on DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1282348800,3,181,4.870967741935484
4018525,2,B002ZG98L4,"As with Alice In Wonderland, The Last Airbender and Clash of the Titans, most of the live action 3D looks flat and off; a result of turning 2D nto 3D in post production.  What does pop is most, if not all, of the underwater footage.  A tell-tale sign of this is the scenery seen through a jeep's windshield early in the movie.  It exists on the same plane as the windshield...no depth beyond.  Same with a dolly past a chain link fence and later weeds near a dock.  The only way I could confirm there was any 3D effect was by shutting then reopenning one eye.  Very disappointing and I'm afraid the thing that may kill this current 3D resurgence.  It's odd with this film, though.  In Clash of the Titans, it was easy to make the distinction between the live action and CGI heavy scenes in depth.  With Pirhana 3D, there are some live action scenes that seem to have been shot in 3D, though not many.  I also saw a 3D trailer for the fourth Resident Evil and the flatness of the actors (oppose to the dep third dimension look of objects that are thrown towards the camera)leads me to believe this movie is done the same way...made 3D in post -- not shot that way.

As for the movie, I expected shlock and received it.  What it didn't do was crap out on effects.  There is a huge body count and lots of SFX makeup & effects -- all extremely well done.  The acting is typical of exploitation movies.  I found the lead's little sister extremely annoying thanks to a screenwriter who thought what she spouted was funny.  Jerry O'Connell is so over the top that anyone not familiar with his past work, would think he was a lousy actor.  He played it SO big but in this kind of movie it kind of works for him.  The others did credible work but in a movie like this, it seems goofy to do so. Nice little cameo in the beginning that might be a little too ""wink, wink, aren't we clever"".  Lots of breasts and bottoms and girl-on-girl action for titilation, including an extended sapphic nude underwater ballet.  There was also some unintentional laughs from some dumb moves by some of the cast.  For example, a large glass bottom boat runs into some rocks.  Do the two rescuers come up to the boat from the rear where there should be no rocks?  No, they rescue them from the bow where the rocks are, meaning the rescue has to take place across a rope between the two boats.  Plus, the two young lovers are towed through this dangerous area underwater by a speeding boat...where they make it through without the sight of a rock.
Maybe I'm getting to deep into this.  It's a movie to watch when you'v got your mind in neutral and you want some cheap B-movie thrills done technically right.  I would suggest seeing this in flat 2D if you have the opportunity.  If you are a 3D fan, the off-putting faux 3D will annoy you very much.  However, that does mean you'll be missing the 3D sight of a pirhana biting, swallowing, then spitting out Jerry O'Connell's penis in front of your face.  Oh, and having someone vomit overboard on you.",1282348800,4,3021,4.373429084380611
4018526,4,B002ZG98L4,"If you see this movie with the right crowd, you'll probably leave the theater thinking you've just witnessed the best thing ever put to film. If you pay $8.00 to view something called Piranha 3-D, I'm sure you know better than to expect anything more than a cheesy horror delight. This takes Snakes on a Plane to a whole new level. There is no getting around the fact that Piranha 3-D delivers everything you could possibly want in a carnivorous fish movie. Way more so than the late 70's original is a understatement. In a little under 90 minutes you get huge doses of nudity and some extremely sick and well done gore effects. The story is as simple as an earthquake waking up thousands of piranhas who have been feeding off each other in an underwater cavern for millions of years. They swim up through the crack in the earth and find themselves in the middle of spring break. Whoa, deep huh? To be fair, the acting is way better than what you would expect. The main kid wasn't annoying and Jerry O'Connell turned in a crazy performance, while Elisabeth Shue, Ving Rhames, and Adam Scott made the silliness believable by at least trying to act serious. Did I mention there are fun cameos by both Richard Dreyfuss and Christopher Lloyd? Dreyfuss even sings ""Show Me the Way to Go Home"" from Jaws and seems to be wearing the same outfit.

The CGI fish looked good and the use of pratical make-up FX really did this film wonders. The carnage during the main attack has to be seen to be believed. The director, Alexandre Aja, says there are around 6 minutes or so that were cut to get this an R rating. I will be looking forward to the Director's Cut on Blu-ray.

This is the first 3-D film that I've seen done after the fact (I know it was shot with the format in mind) that manages to look okay. You don't really feel the depth of being in the movie like with Avatar and How to Train Your Dragon. It mostly relies on vomit, ugly fish, or body parts flying at you, but it didn't hurt my eyes or look too blurry.

I'm really surprised that most critics are taking a liking to it, but I guess even they can't resist pretty girls being torn to pieces by B movie creatures. Either that or they just enjoyed the decapitation of Eli Roth.",1282262400,5,2232,4.373493975903615
4018527,4,B002ZG98L4,"Back when James Cameron's ""Avatar"" was released, there was a lot of talk about the future of 3-D movies - about how much better the process had become with high definition cameras, about how they didn't simply throw things at the screen but actually immersed you in another world. In March of 2009, Josh Quittner of ""Time"" published an article about the 3-D revolution, particularly in relation to ""Avatar,"" which had yet to be released. After seeing some finished footage, he concluded that the work was so absorbing and detailed that he awoke the following morning with the peculiar sensation of wanting to return to Pandora, as if it were real. ""Cameron wasn't surprised,"" he wrote. ""One theory, he says, is that 3-D viewing `is so close to a real experience that it actually triggers memory creation in a way that 2-D viewing doesn't.' His own theory is that stereoscopic viewing uses more neurons.""

Given what was said at the time, what would Quittner say now about movies like ""Piranha 3-D,"" a remake of Joe Dante's 1978 film? Hell, what would Cameron say, given that 1981's ""Piranha II: The Spawning"" was his directorial debut? Would there be any mention of triggering memory creations or neurons or wanting to return to anything? I have my doubts. They might, however, have a thing or two to say about a shot late in the film of two piranhas fighting over a severed penis, the victor eventually spitting out the half-eaten remains directly at the screen. The audience I sat with had plenty to say, although not in words so much as in loud outbursts of disgust and laughter; I clearly heard a guy a few rows behind me say, ""Dude, ugh, dude!"" This is the future of 3-D, folks. Cameron and Quittner should be proud.

I'm going out on a limb here, but ""Piranha 3-D"" is about as good as a film called ""Piranha 3-D"" can possibly be. It's a no-holds-barred celebration of campy horror - bloody, brainless, and bawdy. It cheerfully assaults the senses and spits in the face of decency, not merely with scene after scene of relentless gore, but also with its exploitation of female anatomy, specifically breasts. Oh boy, but there are a lot of breasts in this movie, aided in no small part by real life adult actress Riley Steele and ""Playboy"" model Kelly Brooke. Director Alexandre Aja might as well have called it ""Piranhas and Boobs 3-D.""

Now that I have your attention, shall we get to the plot? In the sleepy little town of Lake Victoria, seismic activity ruptures the lakebed and unleashes thousands of carnivorous prehistoric piranhas from an underwater chasm. They swim to the shores of Lake Victoria, where hordes of loud, drunken, horny teenage tourists are in the thick of Spring Break tomfoolery. The local sheriff, Julie Forester (Elisabeth Shue), and her deputy, Fallon (Ving Rhames), try to solve the mystery of how a half-eaten body washed up on shore; they join forces with a specially trained underwater research team, and as you can probably guess, the divers will not like what they find when they reach the chasm. Meanwhile, Julie's teenage son, Jake (Steven R. McQueen), is drawn into the world of Derrick Jones (Jerry O'Connell), a sleazoid Joe Francis parody filming his newest porn movie on a boat.

Julie manages to bring a live piranha to Mr. Goodman (Christopher Lloyd), the eccentric fish store owner and convenient piranha expert. This particular species, he claims, was supposed to have gone extinct millions of years ago; apparently, the ones that escaped the chasm kept themselves alive by feeding on themselves. Okay, I'll give him that one; we know that cannibalistic species can successfully procreate. But what about the fact that they have emerged from complete darkness and extreme pressure, meaning they would not be able to adapt to the light or to the shallow waters, meaning they wouldn't be able to reach the human flesh they so hunger for? Evolution has taught us that, in all likelihood, these fish wouldn't even have eyes.

But what a minute. Why am I applying logic to this film? It's not about scientific accuracy. It's about people being eaten alive. It's about severed limbs floating in the water. It's about moments of blood-soaked absurdity, like when a girl gets her hair caught in the propeller blades of a boat, pulling her scalp and face clean off her skull. It's about naked girls repeatedly shaking their chests. I wish it wasn't about severed penises and the fish that enjoy eating them, but I guess you have to take the good with the bad. I can't bring myself to say that ""Piranha 3-D"" is a good film, but it certainly achieves exactly what it wanted to achieve. You will laugh. You will scream. You will cringe. Assuming you're a straight male, you will be aroused for much of the time. It's sordid fun. All the same, I can't help but wonder if James Cameron, who revolutionized the 3-D experience, isn't somewhere right now sulking in shame.",1282262400,13,4905,4.786304604486423

4018606,5,B002ZG98L4,"I can recall renting this several years from Netflix and watched it with my girlfriend at the time.  We had so much fun laughing, admiring the gore, and all around enjoying the strongly updated look and new generational feel that it had to offer.

To be fair while the original 1978 Roger Corman movie was fine for its time, this version takes the elements that were good and just okay about the original and brings them up a few steps further.  Don't get me wrong the original wasn't a bad movie, it just needed an update to allow it to have more happening in special effects and whatnot.

That being said, this movie is for sure a bad movie with just okay computer effects but who cares, this movie is a colossal exploding powderkeg of fun!  While the CGI for the piranha isn't perfect they are still cool to look at and anytime those vicious fish look at the camera or attack people in general, I'll bite on that hook to reel me in as they're still scary and menacing.  It's not too hard to suspend disbelief if the movie is entertaining enough. The 3-D aspect and also the Blu-ray transfer are a boatload(LOL) of fun as that makes the movie alot scarier and cooler a watch of which truly put me into the movie causing me to feel as though I too am fighting and struggling with these flesh hungry fish.

The gore effects on the other hand, I found those to be very well done to be sure.  In terms of gore this movie doesn't hesitate to pull any punches there in the least.  It shows very graphically and effectively to what extent people are getting gnawed on and pulled apart by those nasty fish.  The intensity of the attacks as well spares no expense in general.

The action with the cops shooting at the fish, escaping the fish, and best of all Ving Rames slicing them to sushi with the electric oar all give well to more of the excitement and fun that this movie offers generously.

The camp value and dark humor gave a nice touch to the movie as well.

The multitude of really hot babes and female nudity was highly enjoyable.  Even as beautiful and steamy hot Elizabeth Shue chose to underplay her sex appeal she still added to the eye-candy.  She still proved one sexy sheriff as she still loved drop dead gorgeous and her butt looked really good in those tight khakis.

Other than those things about the movie, it was great to get that appearance at the beginning(albeit short) of Richard Dreyfuss.  Nice Jaws inside joke.  Also to have Christopher Lloyd once again playing a scientist was also enjoyable.  Two actors of whom as far as I'm concerned are welcome any time.

So in closing,  If you like b-movie camp and silliness, great gore, creepy creatures that are highly menacing, playful dark humor, really hot and topless babes, a cool 3-D experience, sexy people partying, and just a simple overall fun time, then this movie is for you.

Supposedly Piranha 3D is a 2010 remake of 1978's Piranha, but other than they both have little carnivorous fish who develop a liking for human flesh, there aren't really many similarities. The 1978 film was a parody of Jaws, it was a great film that still stands the test of viewing time today, if you haven't done so check it out.  But the plot of that, and the plot of this are completely different.

This film takes place at Spring Break, a fresh water lake has sat on top of a much larger lake since prehistoric times, an earthquake causes a section of the modern lake's floor to collapse opening a gap for the things that live in the lower lake to explore the one above them.  There's plenty of bloodshed, lots of topless and naked women, and even the piranhas up close look pretty good. The film simply a lot of fun. A lot of people get chomped on.

4018793,5,B002ZG98L4,"You know what might be the problem with 3D for
some individuals?  Perhaps its the fact the format is taking
itself way too seriously.  Yeah, it's great to put on those
glasses and watch something as beautiful as Avatar or
perhaps something charming and funny like Despicable Me
or Coraline.

However, you have to give a hand to director Alexandre
Aja (The Hills Have Eyes) for delivering Piranha 3D, the
most over-the-top and repulsive summer massacre movie
this reviewer has ever seen -- perfectly exploiting 3D.  This
no-holds-barred film sinks as low as any film dares to go
yet it manages to get some interesting veteran actors in
on the fun that include Elisabeth Shue, Ving Rahmes,
Christopher Lloyd and even Richard Dreyfus.

So, let me begin by giving you the fake plot of the movie.
Basically,  as the film opens we are treated to Richard
Dreyfus, fishing off a boat in the middle of a lake, offering
up a parody of his Matt Hooper character from Jaws.  He
throws a beer bottle into the water.  Moments later, there's
a huge subterranean rip that unleashes hundreds of vicious
prehistoric piranhas that race to the surface and for days
following, terrorize the waters of a quaint town occupied by
hundreds of teenagers on Spring Break.

Let me now give you the real plot of the movie.  Basically,
Piranha 3D is a mockery of gore films of the 70s and 80s
including the original 70's classic.  It's a shameless
opportunity to bring as much ridiculously excessive nudity,
gore and shock value that can be capitalized within a 3D
environment.

This film has got teeth!

Speaking of 3D, one needs to go to extremes to provide
the most impressionable viewing experience you will ever
have.  Never before have I seen so much carnage and
body parts (including a severed penis) thrown at the screen
at once -- all executed perfectly to give the viewer an excess
of ""In Yo' Face"" moments.  Oh, and did I fail to mention the
inclusion of hot, naked girls who fling off their tops and shake
their boobs all in glorious 3D?

Piranha 3D was not originally shot for 3D and was later
upconverted in post production.  This may explain some
of the ghosting problems I discuss further on in this review.
Nonetheless, I was surprised how effective most of the
3D here was.  In fact, I found most of the presentation
to be mostly top-notch. The film is colorful, razor sharp,
and has a superb sense of depth to it. The filmmakers
never miss an opportunity to get as ""gimmicky"" as possible
with their arsenal of props that often leap off the screen at
the viewer.  If you are someone like me who lives for
gimmickry, this film does it more than any other.

That's not to say everything is perfect with this transfer.
The initial underwater scenes are mirky and unfortunately
some of the best intended 3D effects (such as a falling
beer bottle) are lost in the process.  However, the underwater
sequences become greatly improved as the film moves on.
I am certain there are many that will marvel at the underwater
lesbian acrobatics that take on...uhm...stunning dimensionality.

Unfortunately, this is a transfer plagued with ghosting.
You can see the image doubling right at the opening
credits.  Other times it appears along facial and body
contours.  As expected, darker scenes suffer the most.
I found the ghosting here to a bit more problematic than
other titles I have recently watched.  I am also aware
that different displays and hardware may lessen the
amount of double imaging you actually see.  For that
reason, I am not going to let it affect the overall review
rating.

Featuring 5.1 DTS-HD audio, Piranha 3D boasts a
highly aggressive soundtrack that completely surrounds
the listener with atmospherics that include a never-ending
array of effect noise, most notably that of water and various
ominous creaks cleverly placed to heighten freight level.
There's a fair amount of LFE activity present which becomes
more booming during the rap music sequences provided by none
other than ""Chocolate Thunder.""  A highly effective, engrossing
soundtrack.

Extras on the disc include a filmmakers commentary as
well as 10 behind-the-scenes Featurettes.

CONCLUSION

The secret to truly enjoying Piranha 3D is to
never take it seriously.  Obviously the filmmakers didn't
nor did the screen veterans who jumped at the opportunity
to do cameos.  The film is pure camp and nothing more.

Understanding the above, the film only plays to a certain
type of audience.  It's perfect for a dorm room party or
perhaps a bunch of guys hangin' out in front of the TV
away from their wives.  On the other hand, it's not the
sort of thing you would want to show at a PTA party.
Yes, the film is horrifically gross, but I found myself
laughing aloud at it more than actually being repulsed.

Personally, I found Piranha 3D to be another stellar
viewing experience.  In fact, despite the fact that the
film was upconverted in post production I still feel that
to date, it belongs on any Top 10 list of titles to add to
your collection.

For those that are not easily offended, I highly
recommend you run out and purchase this Blu-ray.",1453075200,,5110,4.776765375854214

i'm not innately against a little gratuitous nudity--i mean, i cut my teeth on 80's horror movies--but they really bored me to death with it. enough already. i'm actually intrigued by the subterranean lake that houses prehistoric fish and cool-a$$ roe. i am a sucker for the whole ""i'm-supposed-to-babysit-but-i-totally-mess-it-up-and-need-a-rescue-from-mom/dad"" trope, but they didn't give me enuf with that, either. i also adore people like elizabeth shue, ving rhames, adam scott, and christopher lloyd, not to mention matt hooper himself, richard dreyfuss. but they didn't develop the cool ideas enough, and instead went for the easy draw, tons of boring nudity.

and the nudity went from sort of jaunty and fun, to misogynist and mean-spirited pretty quickly, especially with the male characters screaming sexual epithets at women, often while they were being killed, often while they were being killed naked. i know it seems contradictory to say i don't necessarily mind gratuitous nudity and the gratuitous nudity in this movie felt gross to me, but it i don't and it did. i think they could have put their foot on the breaks, and fleshed out (pun super intended) other parts of the script. and i'm not saying i wanted a deep movie by any stretch, or something epic. but the original succeeds because the characters are given something to do, and we grow to like them. it aint jaws, but it's pleasant. i really wanted to spend more time with the main characters in this movie, but there just wasn't enough there.

i do love me some gore, and it was good here. the practical effects were cool, especially the skeletal remains of eaten-up people. the cgi was up and down, but not distracting. there were some awesome underwater sequences, as well, particularly the first descent through the passageway opened up by the earthquake.  i also really liked christopher lloyd's character, who, of course, there wasn't enough of, and his super nifty aquarium set up.

i wanted to like this movie, and i love this type of movie--animals eating people--but it just didn't quite work for me. what i liked, there wasn't enuf of, and what i didn't, i was beat over the head with. honestly, i think it was something of a misuse of aja's talents. to be fair, i suspect i would have enjoyed this movie more with an audience; in that instance, i might have been less concerned with what the movie could have been, and more accepting of what it was.",1416355200,,2771,4.813025210084033

Piranha 3D directed by Alexander Aja is actually the second remake of the original Piranha which was released in 1978. Although his direction appears to be terribly misguided, Aja delivered a fun chompity chomp chomp romp; packed with lots of T&A, lesbians, along with some nice bloody and brutal gore. The gore scenes make up for plenty of the films shortcomings, but my overall opinion of Aja's directing hasn't really changed. He's still a hack for the most part.

I thought the special effects were pretty cool only in regards to the death and mauling. This was actually an area the original needed improvement on. The viewer gets a front row seat for the maximum carnage when it gets there. These fish are very aggressive predators with one hell of a voracious appetite for fresh flesh. When they started munching, I actually felt the supposed comedy go right out the window. The death scenes are pretty disturbing, with people being eaten damn near down to the very bone, with the fish pulling out a couple of eyeballs here and there. Yuck! But yummy too! I enjoyed the action scenes when the sheriffs were trying to fight them off, and one scene that I won't spoil was really cool, even though it kind of felt ripped from 28 Weeks Later.

Unfortunately, Aja can't really tell a story to save his life as the film suffers from a bad clashing of genres, erratic pacing, and at least one disposable side plot. I thought the plot during the first half was both hit and miss due to the pacing. There were some boring moments here and there, with the only interesting portion for me being the back story on the fish, which is quite different from the original and seems a bit more likely to me.

The setting takes place in a swimming resort during Spring Break with a whole bunch of college students. So you know what this means; lots of T&A, I mean way too much. Now, I have nothing against sexy women bodies, but there's adult dvd's, hookers, and mistresses for all that. Here, it presented a problem for me, I felt it heavily distracted from the horror element, and I was stuck between being either horrified or horny. That is not suppose to happen. I also really hated the sub plot concerning two children whom got themselves stranded on a little island. This was one useless story element because we all know that there's a 99.99999999% chance that the kids are not going to die. So why even go there? Aja did assemble a pretty decent cast here, with other vets such as Christopher Lloyd and Richard Dreyfuss making appearances. Their roles were small but at least they were in there, with Kelly Brook and Riley Steele providing the eye candy. The acting really wasn't bad to me so no complaints here.

Despite my disdain for horror remakes, Piranha 3D wasn't really that bad of a movie. It definitely has problems but the death toll and misery made up for it in someways. I think this is one of the more decent remakes out there, and if you love T&A and gore, then this is for you.

Pros: Loads of gore, T&A

Cons: T&A can be heavily distracting, pacing issues, unnecessary subplot",1413158400,,3606,4.625

4019160,4,B002ZG98L4,"Piranha 3-D, released in 2010, is the bombdiggity. I feel that anything with Elisabeth Shue in it must be the bombdiggity. Hollow Man, for instance, is the bombdiggity (okay, not really). Piranha 3-D not only is a raucous horror comedy, it's also a badass animal attack film. It's ideal for those midnight screenings that you put on for your beer-guzzling homies on Friday nights because you can't get a date.

As spring breakers descend for their annual romp on the 25 square miles that is Lake Victoria, Arizona, a seismic tremor beneath the lake lets loose a marauding swarm of prehistoric piranhas. Suddenly, testy small-town sheriff Julie Forester (Shue) has all she can handle as she scrambles to save hordes of oblivious revelers. It wouldn't do to wreck the town's most lucrative tourist trap.

The camera splits time between the harried sheriff and her own teenaged son Jake (Steven R. McQueen). Jake is one of them kids that always hangs in the periphery, not quite cool enough to be in the school's power cliques. He's nursing one of them unrequited crushes on super-cute Kelly (Jessica Szohr), and a B.M.O.C. frisson must've coursed thru him when he's hired as location scout for a skeevy Girls Gone Wild-type filmmaker (Jerry O'Connell). And cool points for Jake because here's Kelly now, suddenly an invited guest on board the filmmaker's boat.

For some reason (maybe charity?), this movie is populated by recognizable names. Richard Dreyfuss, Christopher Lloyd, Eli Roth, Dina Meyer, and Ving Rhames all participate, some more significantly than others. Maybe Dreyfuss was tricked into thinking he was signing on for Jaws 5. Rest in peace, Richard Dreyfuss, rest in peace. Here comes the required sciency 'splanation as only Christopher Lloyd, furiously channeling his best Dr. Emmett Brown, can deliver. He's the local ichthyologist who briefs the baffled sheriff that what she's dealing with is a particularly ancient strain of piranha what vanished off the face of the earth over 2 million years ago right before the Pliocene Epoch. To bolster the scientific ranks, a staff of seismologists enter the fray, figure out that there's a subterranean lake under Lake Victoria, and then two of the three promptly get chewed up. The one intact seismologist transforms into action hero seismologist. He's crafty at steering motor boats.

Elisabeth Shue is onscreen and looking good and so this was never gonna be a lost cause. But it turns out that Piranha 3-D is tons of fun, anyway. It's campy and absurd and there's hammy acting, and there's sure no dearth of gratuitous nudity and excessive carnage. Jerry O'Connell seems to be having the time of his life playing the repulsive jackhat. There may have been a danger of desensitization, except that there are too many novel and deliciously gruesome piranha attacks. It's impressive, son, and the bodycount is staggering. Standout kills include some random chick whose hair gets entangled in a motorboat's blades and, also, this other poor chick and, in what must've been a seminal 3-D moment, what happens to her gaping mouth. Even the survivors who emerge from the water look seriously messed up.

Also, wet t-shirt contest in 3-D.

The ones to root for are Shue, the cute girl Kelly, and Jake's younger sister. I can't stand Jake the human doormat, and I longed for his aggravating younger brother to violently end up as bloody chum in the water. Cast and crew have no delusions about the kind of film they shot. Pretentious art house material, this ain't. The film wants you to have a good time. It rolls out plenty of awesome W.T.F. moments. In the annals of horror cinema, Piranha 3-D goes down as an unapologetic, super-gory, tongue-in-cheek cult classic. It's a hell of a good time and best enjoyed if you're in the company of your not quite sober pals. And what do you mean Richard Dreyfuss isn't dead?",1407110400,3,3874,4.952307692307692

4019222,4,B002ZG98L4,"What can I say about Piranha aka Piranha 3D?

First it is NOT for the faint of heart... Lots of blood and guts people.

Second, kids SHOULD NOT see this... it'd probably make their heads explode either from the blood and gore or the excessive boobage.

Other than that, It's a remake that actually was good.

While it isn't true to the original Piranha, Piranha (3D as it was called) was actually really good at telling the story, delivering the gore, and making you laugh at the same time.

The Piranha themselves... nicely done. They were CGI but BELIEVABLE CGI.

The cast was AWESOME. Very good acting. Well, what do you expect from Richard Dryfuss, Ving Rhames, Elizabeth Shue, Christopher Lloyd, Jerry O'Connell? Nothing but the best!

And a cameo by ELI ROTH doesn't hurt either. Kudos to him for his scenes.

Some great moments were Ving Rhames' sacrifice, Christopher Lloyd's climatic ending, and of course THE PENIS JOKE at Jerry O'Connell's character's expense.

I won't say more and give it away but ... If you are a fan of the first one, go into this one as if it were a new movie or you probably will hate it because it's nothing like the original. If you are not a fan but love Blood and Gore... and yea, lots o' boobie... SEE THIS MOVIE. It's fun and it's a well done remake ... re-imagining... whatever... anyway it is a MUST SEE.",1405728000,,1346,4.528925619834711

I was a little leery of the CGI fish I saw in them, but fortunately they look more convincing in the film. What's not to like here? From the start we get Richard Dreyfuss in full Matt Hooper gear and singing the famous drunken sailor song from Jaws(""show me the way to go home...."") paying homage to the greatest animal attack film of all time, sitting in a boat on the water....you just know this is not going to turn out good!

The film starts off running and never lets up and even though the first piranha attack looks too cartoon-ish for my taste, it soon turns into a bloody good mess with tons of T and A thrown in for good measure! The film is very funny with lots of nods to Jaws down to the way certain scenes are shot. I say this is a funny film, but don't think you're going to get off that easy because this film is extremely gory with some very convincing gross out FX! Fortunately(for the guys), there is lots of nude chicks to take our minds off of such unsettling horror! :-D!

I really enjoyed this film and for what it is and it deserves a lot of praise, but......it could have been so much more if it had been played straight at times. It has that kind of potential, to be something truly memorable. This is a good film to grab some beers and a bunch of your friends and have a great time!

but the director do a great job hiding that fact with a lot of sexy / raunchy scenes. I may sound quite primitive said that way, but as a result the tone of the movie is changed and the second degree (or third ? ) is apparent and welcomed.
Overall it is a pretty nice experience, i have some critics that prevent me to put a 5th star.
First the end seems rushed, really rushed, and in my opinion introduce logic gap.
Second the formulaic story is respected too carefully, i'd like to see more (in fact, any) unexpected event in what is clearly an half spoof production, i guess you can't make wave on a lake...

3D:

4019394,5,B002ZG98L4,"As the movie industry matures it seems it has at this point reached a phase where it can't think of anything new and just keeps remaking. This isn't a new thing of course, remakes and adaptation go back to the very start of the industry (what are movies based on books afterall). And while so many of these fall flat because they don't understand what they are making (writing by committee perhaps), this one does it all perfectly.

Don't misunderstand this movie is made to a particular audience and has quite bad special effects for the most part, but they aren't to the point where you don't get what they are trying to convey and if you suspend disbelief for a moment and enjoy the ride you'll have an awesome ride.

The big thing that really pushed this above the line though is the actors. Christopher Lloyd is perfect as the scientist, Elizabeth Shue is great as the carrying mom/tough sheriff, Ving Rhames doesn't get enough lines and Jerry O'Connell is excellent. The one that did it for me though was Richard Dreyfuss who of course did the other movie with water, boats and getting eaten. Although none of these actors are currently at their peak, you can see that they are professional and brought what it took to the roll.

The plot and events are also clearly aimed at the audience: Spring break, lots of nudity, partying and stupidity. Oh yeah, and disaster of course. The whole package is well put together and know that you're getting a horror comedy movie where pretty much everything you will call before it happens ... but then it happens and it's deliciously cringe worthy.

It may have been called Mega Pirahna. Michael Wandmacher composed the music for Piranha. He composed music for the Americanized releases of Armour of God(1986) and Drunken Master II(1994).

The story in Piranha is very simple. The first half of the film has some very gory scenes and some foreshadowing, but mostly sets up the characters, the locations, and the reasoning; it's not incredibly in depth, but it gets the job done. The second half, basically last act, is filled with pure violence; people getting torn to shreds vividly, dismemberments and decapitations, eyes popping out of freshly skinned skulls, and everything in between. I'm a fan of the ""all hell breaks loose"" scenarios and this one is amazing. Fans of gore and special effects will enjoy this; however, some scenes use excessive CGI, like fake blood and some underwater sequences, that I didn't really like. The film moves at a very fast pace, as well. Acting was good for this type of film, and I liked the cameos, especially Eli Roth's.

Why did i buy?:
  I bought this movie when i first purchased my new 3d tv.  Obviously because the tv was so much, i didn't have a lot of left over money to be spending so i looked for a cheap 3d blu ray.  I picked this one up for $8 and it was a good initial 3d experience.

Movie/Plot:
  Not very good, basically this guy meets a porn producer and goes on a ship and looks at hot chicks and then they die.

Quality:
  Surprisingly, Piranha 3D is somewhat unique in terms of how it became a 3D title. Rather than shoot natively in 3D, Director Alexandre Aja chose to shoot in 2D with a 3D conversion during post production in mind, his every shot looking towards the conversion process and ensuring that the eventual 3D image would be of a high quality meeting his standards.  No, Piranha doesn't compare to Avatar but it's still a great test of your 3D tube.

Audio:
  Piranha's DTS-HD MA 5.1 lossless soundtrack is as aggressive as its bad guys, and rarely is the track not jumping with some sort of robust sonic activity. The track handles water elements quite well; whether the calmer flowing of water as heard during surface shots that allows the liquid to spread all through the soundstage or the heavy pressure of underwater segments that come with an immersive sense of depth through seamless surround usage and bass, Sony's lossless track does right by one of the film's most critical elements.

Overall:
  This is a great movie to watch with some of your buddies.  Girls won't appreciate it but guys will.  If they made this into a better plot, it would be a great movie.",1362614400,4,1607,4.457044673539519

If you're the kind of person who realizes the purpose of this movie, being an over the top gory summer horror/comedy flick with tons of nudity, then you'll probably enjoy the hell out of it.

Piranha has the basic creature/animal attack film premise. It's spring break and a remote town fills up the obnoxious college kids and a bunch of piranha's devour every single piece of flesh in sight. The thing that makes it different from all the other mindless creature films is that it is almost a parody of itself in the sense that it is a semi-serious movie that pokes fun at b-movies from a few generations ago.

If you've read other reviews that mention how gory this film is, they couldn't be more correct. This movie is almost as gory as Dead Alive and, without giving too much away, makes a delightful reference to it in the film's climax and fans of Dead Alive will recognize the scene instantly. That alone makes this movie better than most others of its kind.

In terms of substance, there are some pretty funny scenes and the gore itself is enough to keep you entertained. For all the movie buffs out there, there are some cool cameos by famous actors from similar movies including one in the very beginning.

Nudity, there's PLENTY of it in here. You'd be a horrible parent if you let your child watch this if they're under the age of 17 seeing as there are scenes loaded with graphic, full frontal female nudity and a scene involving a man having his.... well.... manhood being taken from him in explicit detail if you know what I mean. The nudity is used mostly in a comic and over the top way and not intended to be sensual.

All in all, this is a great movie for what it's worth and the perfect film to watch with a bunch of (mature) friends during the summer to keep you out of the water just as much as Jaws did and still does.",1360627200,8,1959,4.3856749311294765

If you would like to see a bunch of awesome, rocking breasts, this is the place to see them, because they are all over the place. I'm actually a little surprised this didn't get an NC-17, because there are a few shots (from somewhat far away) of full frontal nudity. They don't make a huge deal of it, though. It's ""artistic nudity.""

Unfortunately, the director keeps showing us half-naked women, and then immediately mauling them to death, cutting them in half, etc. This doesn't happen ALL the time, but it happens enough to be jarring. ""What a waste!"" I kept thinking, over and over. I thought they could have achieved the same level of boobs, and the same level of gore, without mixing them together quite so much.

4019574,1,B002ZG98L4,"Piranha (Alexandre Aja, 2010)

Okay, that's it--I have officially given up on Alexandre Aja. This is the fifth Aja movie I've seen (if you count his first short, Over the Rainbow), and of the five, one of them, Mirrors, was mediocre-if-unnecessary. The rest have all been unwatchable garbage, and this Piranha remake is no exception. In fact, this mess is so godawful I have not only given up on Alexandre Aja, but I have also thrown in the towel with Ving Rhames and Elisabeth Shue--both of whom I have seen in a number of bad movies, but nothing this awful. And Richard Dreyfuss? Christopher Lloyd? What the hell were you two thinking?

If you've seen the original, you know the basic idea, and the remake doesn't do too much to expand it--there are these piranha, see. One of the things that does change is that they're really, really old piranha, from prehistoric times even (Carl Goodman, a researcher played by Lloyd, tells the county sheriff, played by Shue, that they haven't been seen on this planet for two hundred million years. In that melodramatic Christopher Lloyd voice, naturally). An earthquake at the bottom of Lake Havasu--excuse me, Lake Victoria, which just happens to reside on the very western border of Arizona (see the difference?)--lets them free from the subterranean lake where they've been living just as spring break starts. Things are complicated by a sleazy Girls Gone Wild-style director (Jerry O'Connell) who's filming some underwater porn, and when his location scout flakes out, he ends up hiring Jake, a local (The Vampire Diaries' Steven R. McQueen, no relation to the director of Hunger), who just happens to be the sheriff's son, as his new location scout, and the boy's wannabe girlfriend Kelly (Gossip Girl's Jessica Szohr, who rivals the ""porn stars"", played by British socialite Kelly Brook and actual real-life porn star Riley Steele, in the hots department) tags along when Mr. Sleazoid sees her. To make things even more silly, Jake is supposed to be babysitting his younger brother and sister (Brokeback Mountain's Brooklynn Proulx, easily the best thing about this movie, and Spooky Buddies' Sage Ryan) while all this is going on and, well, despite the fact that he paid them very well to stay at home, kids will be kids...

You know, I could probably forgive this movie a lot--its gratuitous nudity, the awful green-screening and worse CGI, the 3D (which is far more Jaws 3-D than even the worst Real-D movie you've ever seen), the idiotic special effects, arguably the worst soundtrack I have ever heard in a movie--if Alexandre Aja had any idea what made the original film such a barrel of fun. But it's obvious from the get-go that he doesn't. Hell, one wonders if he's ever even seen the original. Joe Dante's original, with its sharp-as-a-piranha-tooth John Sayles script, is such a good stupid movie because while you know you're not supposed to take it seriously, Dante and Sayles present it to you as if you're supposed to. This is a very important distinction, and it is one that is totally lost on Aja. Dante and Sayles were lampooning the ecohorror flicks of Guerdon Trueblood and his ilk, and they had endless amounts of fun doing so, but they were still making an ecohorror exploitation movie. Alexandre Aja instead chose to make a softcore comedy that contains a whole lot of fake blood. That is an entirely different beast indeed, and to make things worse, Aja really, really needs you to know that he's in on the joke, and so he ends up throwing in things that are supposed to be funny. I think. They're actually, mostly, tasteless and stupid, unless you're a toilet-humor and [censored for Amazon consumption]-joke-obsessed prepubescent.

Like most folks, I haven't generally been a fan of the whole ""remake everything in sight"" movement that has infected Hollywood since Ring became a worldwide phenomenon ten years ago. But most of the time, I haven't outright loathed the remakes; there have only been three real exceptions to that rule. Marcus Nispel's ridiculous remake of Friday the 13th. Josef Rusnak's virulently pro-life remake of It's Alive in 2008. And now, Alexandre Aja's remake of Piranha, which somehow manages to transcend even the stupidity of his own remake of The Hills Have Eyes. This is the epitome of the phrase ""a waste of celluloid.""

4019630,5,B002ZG98L4,"While no masterpiece of modern cinema - Piranha certainly delivers the goods.

It has a great sense of humor; some fun cameos (including a great ""Jaws"" homage in the opening frames) and really great gore sequences. While not all the squishy stuff is practical, the sequences themselves are highly effective (enough to make my wife WANT to swim with a hair net on - when you see a certain scene you'll understand).

All that being said - YES - this is a Big Budget B movie. But so many Amazon customers just don't seem to understand what films like this are supposed to be. Escapist, silly entertainment. I also understand this is a supposed remake - but this doesn't retain the restrained humor or (sometimes) grating political commentary of the original. This is much lighter fare - and, hence, is a breezier picture. Of course I also love the Corman produced original (no intentions of knocking it) - but for my dollar - this is a funner watch (with a much better - less offensive climax).

Possible customers come to Amazon and read customer reviews to see a product is something they may enjoy. Generally; if you hate campy/silly/T+A slasher flicks and monster films - there is no reason to come on this site and bash them. And that seems to be the problem here; somehow - with all the ""deep"" movies coming from Hollywood knowadays - it seems today's youth are scared to enjoy entertainment without deep subtext. Of course - it's alright to love the genre and hate this movie - and those reviews are more than welcome.

For me - this is the pinnacle of this sub-genre of horror - and 3D gets an A+.

4019632,3,B002ZG98L4,"Although it sports the same title, this is less a remake of the 1978 drive-in classic produced by Roger Corman and directed by Joe Dante than it is a VERY rated R Syuh Fyuh (SyFy - but I write it phonetically) channel Saturday night premiere flick. But this one has the clear advantage of being in 3-D! We start to realize the tongue might be in the cheek in the opening moments as the old guy we see fishing in a small boat turns out to be Richard Dreyfuss in his Matt Hooper outfit from Jaws, singing ""Show Me the Way to Go Home"" (the song he and Roy Scheider and Robert Shaw sing out on the Orca in Spielberg's classic) and drinking ""Amity"" brand beer. Moments later, seismic activity in the lake bed underneath results in our learning several lessons: Lesson #1: this movie is keeping things nice and simple. No long scenes of the local seismic monitoring station predicting quakes to come, no town officials being mad about impending quake activity, none of that. Richard Dreyfuss, Jaws jokes, quake, killer fish swimming up out of resulting crack in lake bed. Lesson #2: there is going to be a lot of CGI in this movie, and it's going to range from pretty good to PlayStation 1 cut scene in quality; and Lesson #3: they could only afford Richard Dreyfuss for one day.
  From there we get 3-D credits, and then settle in for a little plot as we meet our characters. Young Jake (McQueen) is the son of the town sheriff (Shue) and is on a very short leash, forced to miss out on the town's annual spring break festivities again to babysit his younger brother and sister (who seemed cloned from the youngest duo on the Partridge Family). He has an almost dating thing going on with Kelly (Szohr) and gets 3-D sodas thrown on him by the town bullies. His luck changes when he meets the gorgeous Danni (Brook) then changes again when he meets her boss Derrick Jones (O'Connell), the hyperactive producer/director of the naughty ""Wild Wild Girls"" DVD series. With his hormones a'ragin' Jake makes plans to pay off the little ones to stay home and is hired to join the production crew on Jones' rented yacht ostensibly to show the producer the most visually sumptuous spots on the lake but really to see Danni and her co-star Crystal in bikinis and hopefully even less. In the meantime the sheriff and her trusted deputy (Rhames, wasted here, sad to say) find Dreyfuss's chewed up body and send it off for autopsy. The next day, we gear up all of our subplots: while she waits for the autopsy results, Shue also welcomes a scuba crew from that local seismic activity organization I mentioned who plan to dive down and take a look at what the quakes did to the lake's bottom; Jake heads out with Derrick and crew, but not before finding Kelly invited along by the ultra lecherous video producer; to better their fishing (and put more people in jeopardy in several different places) the Partridge Family twins leave the house, jump in a rowboat and paddle over to a small island nearby where they promptly lose the boat back out into the middle of the lake, stranding them; and the producers manage to get about a thousand extras into the town harbor for the Spring Break party. At about the same time, everyone figures out there are prehistoric piranha in the lake when people near them go into the water and red spew foams up. Eventually one is captured and taken to the local pet shop owner (Lloyd) who doubles as a prehistoric fish expert. (!) He warns Shue to get everyone out of the lake, but that's not going to be easy, starting with her kids. Who will survive, and what will be left of them?
  This is a wonderfully silly horror flick done to a T, with gratuitous EVERYTHING, and that goes triple for the cameo by Hostel director Eli Roth. Among the highlights: a nude underwater ballet between Brook and Steele (after they'd been down for about four minutes without air my niece and movie watching bud Sandra leaned over and said they sure were holding their breath for a long time - I pointed out they were wearing their air tanks right up front); more ways to kill people with fish and boating equipment than you ever would have believed possible - good mix of Greg Nicotero & Howard Berger makeup effects and CGI gore here; hundreds of babes in bikinis, a couple of dozen babes out of bikinis; one cheeky piranha who swims into closeup and all but winks at the audience; and 3-D that was added later but obviously planned for early enough to get quite a bit of the usual stuff into your face, and some things I never expected to see floating before my eyes in a 3-D movie. Just when you think this movie has gone as far as it can go in terms of outrageousness, director Aja finds a way to take it a bit further. Rumor has it that Aja wanted Piranha director Dante and Piranha II: The Spawning director James Cameron (yes, that one!) to pop in for a shared cameo as boating safety instructors. As might be expected, Dante was up for it, but Cameron ""couldn't fit it in his schedule."" That's too bad, as it would have been a hoot. And, despite this flick being almost a complete departure from the original, there is one very welcome climactic nod to the 1978 gem involving McQueen, a boat, and a long (almost magically long) rope that ties them together. As for the acting, Shue, McQueen and Scott play it straight, which does give the later reels some decent suspense, but everyone else is showing up for a wink and a paycheck, which is just fine too. Kudos must also go to O'Connell, who pulls out all the stops in his depiction of Screen Weaseldom right through to his expected messy end. The biggest disappointment is that Rhames, who has a bravura last scene, is given almost nothing else to do. Why hire him if you're not going to let him throw off some wry lines like he does in the Mission: Impossible movies? Still, that's quibbling in a movie like this. It is a lot of fun, and you know going in what you're going to see, (or maybe you don't - all the more reason then) so by all means throw on the glasses and give this one a try!",1348358400,,6049,4.446846846846847
4019633,4,B002ZG98L4,When I saw that they were going to remake pirahana I was siked and I mean it was good but the original was better all this one is titties partying and a lot of blood and SPOILER richard dreyuss gets eaten at the very begging,1348272000,,224,4.0
4019634,1,B002ZG98L4,"How's that possible? Somehow, this movie made it so. Lake Victoria is invaded by a bunch of childish adults there for 'spring break' (I'm refusing to give that capitalized letters, like it's a real holiday) and plenty-more piranha are released into the water after an earthquake reveals a subterranean lake. So...they go on a feeding frenzy, chowing-down on the morons who remain in the water despite the sheriff telling them to not go in. Many of them die in gruesome ways and you'll see chewed-up flesh (plus some that's better-looking beforehand). How will the fishies all be destroyed? Do you care? Not if you saw commercials where it was basically given-away.

One thing I'll say, comparing it to the original, I really disliked the movement of the fish very-much. Here you have obvious computer-generated piranha. With the original PIRANHA in the 1970's flick, from what I recall (it's been a while) you see them on a slight-angle but as a group coming straight ahead to their target and it looked neater. They were of the proper size of the animal, the sound of them chewing things was just really awesome and scary to me, and you didn't see them for too-long on the screen which added to the mysteriousness/suspense. The classic, which this 2010 movie is very-loosely based around, is more interesting to me and Joe Dante was a better director at balancing humor, drama, and horror in it.

If you want to see some porn 'actresses' (Riley Steele, Ashlynn Brooke, Gianna Michaels) getting killed, a lot of fake 'spring break' scenarios (with people behaving like drunken, drugged-up idiots like at the actual stupid event), and bad acting which mostly consists of people screaming and Jerry O'connell's character portraying a perv, check it out. For those who saw this attempt in 3D, I bet that the majority of it was some nudity and the shot of the dude's unit floating in the water, getting eaten by the fish, and then spit up. You even hear the fish burp! Funny? Nope. There was no reason for any of this to be 3D; it wouldn't have improved it and I'm surely not going to view it a second time for any of that or whatever else might be in 3D.

Actually, Mr. O'connell did fine with his filthy character, but it was just annoying in time. The movie has some really great gore-effects and puppetry, but it was overshadowed by plenty of bad CGI and the piranha that are laughable. It was simply a waste of time. The plot's generic and bare (ha ha...a 'naked' reference for you) and despite a good beginning with a great cameo by Richard Dreyfuss as his JAWS character, it all falls apart afterwards.

Of course, with something like this released in the summer, it's not expected to be anything but a popcorn flick and the audience it was made for are just into it for the nudity and gore. Yet I didn't have fun and even if the director wanted it to be a throwback to crazy horror/monster flicks of 1970 & 1980's, it was just embarassingly dull. A lot of the gore was just so over-the-top I couldn't have fun with it. It's not that this type of movie is a kind that I couldn't enjoy. Here, it comes across as trying too-hard to be shocking with the nudity or gore and that resulted in it becoming nothing but repetetive nonsense. The only cool moment that I was really wondering what was going to happen was where Ving Rhames' character was fighting the piranha with the boat propeller, but that was too-short and ultimately boring. It's assumed that he didn't even survive the attack. They should have used him a lot more. NOTE: from what I read, the character's in the failed sequel minus his legs.

Oh, how could I forget to mention the really lame and too-long lesbian scene with the two women performing an underwater 'ballet' (according to the director) with a silly classical music score? It was very forgettable and dumb, to me. The women that were in that part were apparently hired because they were part fish and could stay underwater for an extreme amount of time. Or maybe they just cut some scenes together so viewers could see more nudity. The part should have lasted just a little -- and then piranha should have gotten rid of them. That's what's expected in stuff like this: the naked gals get a nasty death. I can picture a funny scene with O'connell's character, who was filming through the glass-bottom boat, in form
and not really being as disgusted as he should be but yelling at the fish to get out of his shot or complaining about how he now couldn't use a lot of the footage.

Though I saw this free from the library, I don't even recommend that you try to find it there. One star is generous for this banal creature-feature.",1347408000,2,4655,4.595667870036101

The fish, who lived in the cavern should have been blind, a point missed by the producer who was too busy recruiting porn stars, Ashlynn Brooke, Gianna Michaels, and Riley Steele for cameos. Yes there is nudity and lots of it, including underwater full frontal and a severed male organ being devoured by our prehistoric fish. The boat used in the movie has the name ""Barracuda.""

Seriously-as a fan of Roger Corman's 70's Cult Classic directed by genious Joe (The Howling) Dante, I would have given this travesty of a remake ZERO stars if I were able!!! It ranks up there as one of THE worst remakes since the butchered 'It's Alive' (Larry Cohen's genuinely frightening tale of a genetic monster baby born to unassuming suburban parents)! People-if your NOT going to do the originals justice-don't BOTHER making a remake. First off, I don't buy into the whole 'gimmicky trend' of 3-D films as of late. If you have a strong story, great FX, and good actors-you do not NEED 3-D to make your movie good. 'Piranha (2010)' has NONE of these quality's. The movie is chock full of ANNOYING teens who make the current generation look like they SHOULD be eaten by piranha-is this a truly accurate portrayal of our future doctors, lawyers, scientists and political candidates? Sadly-it seems to be. This film is 90 mins. of TERRIBLE acting, an unrealistic storyline, and worst of all-CGI that is BEYOND bad!!! That is unless you WANT your movie FX to look like an Xbox 360 video game. Gory-YES. Convincing-NO. I happen to HATE CGI anyway...I don't care how 'advanced' it has become, it STILL looks like what it is-computer generated FX. So far I'd have to admit that even though I HATED Tri-Star's failed 1998 'Godzilla' redux (which truly was not Godzilla in the first place), it DID have great CGI. Ditto for the awesome redux of 'King Kong' which only failed in the miscasting of Jack Black as Carl Denham...I mean c'mon Peter-Jack BLACK??? I could have been more convincing as Denham-and I've never even acted professionally! What I'm trying to get across is this: this film did NOT have the budget of either of the above mentioned films, so why go CGI? Answer: it's all the 'rage' now. Compare the FX in the remake to the original version. Up and coming wunderkind FX artist Rob Bottin (The Howling, John Carpenter's The Thing, Legend) not only created more convincing mutated piranha, but the way they were filmed was ingenious for it's time, and the film still delivers to this day. More importantly, the original gave us characters who you genuinely CARED about and did NOT want to see get munched. And the original was SCARY. This new version is not scary. Or clever. All the sequel delivers are annoying teens who you WANT to get eaten, plenty of nudity and drug use, extremely phony CGI, and BAD gore FX (shame on you KNB-you should know better). And aside from Ving Rhames and Christopher Lloyd-some really BAD acting. Now I LOVE cheezy flicks...genuinely bad films mostly from the 70's. But the charm was they were not intentionally bad. They had heart. This 'film' has NO heart. It is one cliche after another. I suppose the worst part of it all is how many people actually LIKED this film. It says alot about today's audience...that many are what Archie Bunker used to call 'Meatheads'-dead from the neck up. If that is the case, America is surely in trouble because 'Piranha 2010' has made ONE very important statement: our new generation of teens are only good for fish food.",1341792000,2,3216,4.724199288256227

If you like horror flicks then there's no reason you shouldn't like this one. If  you only want 3d then you have to sit through this flashy trashy film, so look elsewhere.

The decapitations, dismemberments, and fish maulings were incredibly realistic and, at times, nauseating to the core. Well done. I haven't seen this much blood in a film since Planet Terror. Gore fanatics should enjoy this. Comedy was infused sporadically, perhaps to take the edge off. Female nudity was abundant...that definitely took the edge off. Jerry O'Connell stole the show with his convincing portrayal of an exploitating dirtbag, and Kelly Brook deserves more movie roles. You'll get your money's worth on bonus material too.

4019685,3,B002ZG98L4,"Piranha 3D is a very simple movie, boobs alcohol parting and piranha's, pretty simple formula here that harkens back to the good ol' 70's and 80's exploitation flicks. So we have Christopher Lloyd gloriously overacting, Jerry O'Connell playing a huge loveable A-hole (with a very gruesome death), Ving Rhames playing his usual badass self (putting a boat propeller to good use), and Elizabeth Shue playing concerned mother/cop.

Seems like a fun dumb time right? Wrong! Elizabeth Shue has a teenage son and two even YOUNGER little brats, and so much time is focused on these stupid children that it feels like the centerpiece for the film that's called PIRANHA 3D! So we see the teen run into Jerry O'Connell's Girls Gon-sorry, Wild Wild Girls character and they take the whiny puss in so he can show them the good spots around the lake. So the whole time the Wild Wild Girls crew is having a blast the kid is acting like a freaking goth sulking around in the corner and basically adding the suck factor to this movie. But don't worry it gets worse.

Meanwhile the two even younger brats for some reason get stranded on some island in the lake, and that's when you really feel your full money's worth for PIRANHA 3D when you watch two kids squabbling with each other on an island. See the main problem with the kids besides the fact that they're always horrible actors is that in movies like these there's absolutely 0 tension in it. We can see a bunch of teens on spring break get killed violently but if they're wittle childwen then suddenly it's too disturbing for modern audiences. I may just be a sick f*** but if I got to see both of the little kids getting torn to shreds underwater with a look of extreme pain and terror on their faces I would've been dying of laughter in the theater; maybe in the future that'll happen in a big budget horror movie sometime but in the meantime we have to choke down kids being shoehorned into the movie for no reason.

So that's all that really bothered me about Piranha 3D, it seems like a small thing but you'd be suprised in how the screenwriters manage to shove these stupid kids into a script that really should have no place for kids. The teen himself wouldn't have been so bad if he didn't have any siblings and was just looking out for the girl he had a crush on.

Also on a side note *spoilers* WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU SHOW THE LAST SCENE OF THE MOVIE IN THE TRAILER!?!?? While it's not as offensively bad as Quarantine which in all it's wisdom put THE ENDING OF THE MOVIE ON THE POSTER, it's still an awful decision.

Girls gone wild is about right for the nudity.  Mostly quick flashes which is fine but I preferred the more Playboy style scene with Kelly Brook & the blonde under water.  Kelly Brook does look fine in this movie but Survival Island is better if you are a fan of hers.

I enjoyed it for what it was.  I'd either call it 3 or 4 stars (3 1/2 if amazon allowed it) which is the average right now.  I ultimately went with 3 stars because the part where they use a distraction to rig explosives takes ""forever"" & the whole rest of the movie suggests the distraction used would only last a few minutes if that.  Epic fail if it were a serious movie, passable plot device in a campy movie I suppose.  The way they leave it open for a sequel seemed about stupid to me at 1st but once again, it wasn't meant to be that serious.

But the strangest thing happened not only AFTER this movie, but even *during* the movie as well. I actually found myself growing more and more angry. By the time it was finished, I felt like not only had I been robbed of more than an hour of my life that I'll never get back, but I actually felt..I don't know...INSULTED. Yes, insulted. Insulted that anyone would think that literally throwing together a steaming pile of feces like this would be entertaining, and that we would be glad we paid for it. Insulted that whoever did it thinks that 99% of their audience are going to be gorehounds who delight in the sight of people literally being ripped apart, overandoverandoverandover again. Insulted that whoever did it thinks that 99% of the audience are brainless adolescents who delight and revel in mindless, pointless dancing and gratuitous nudity, overandoverandoverandoverandover again.

Also..and I'm not going to throw any spoilers out there, there are plot-holes in this movie that will have you rewinding, just to see if your imagination had played a trick on you, or thinking maybe you had been paying too much attention to the nudity to notice something amiss. LAUGHABLY bad plot-holes.

Do yourself a favor, don't be fooled by the 4 and 5 star reviews, they were either bought and paid for, or were relatives/employees/friends of the people who made this pathetic excuse of a film. I can't BELIEVE Richard Dreyfuss even made a cameo appearance in this one.

4019790,2,B002ZG98L4,"I grew up in the 1970's and 1980's, the last gasp of the American drive-in movie where you could find some serious B-movie classics.  TENTACLES, HUMANOIDS FROM THE DEEP, the birth of the slasher flick...and Joe Dante's original PIRANHA.

Obviously, the filmmakers behind PIRANHA 3-D wanted to capture the spirit of those drive-in movies and there are moments when they do:  getting Richard Dreyfuss to dress up as his Matt Hooper character from JAWS in the opening scene is very cool (he's even singing the same song he drunkenly sang with Quint & Brody).  Seeing Christopher Lloyd both trying and not trying to sound like Doc from BACK TO THE FUTURE as a scientist is also worth the price of submission.  Other touches hit the mark as well, especially when one bimbo is gnawed to the bone by the killer fish and her breast implants drift away in the water.

Another part they got right: nudity.  It always amazed me that the B-movie horror film went so crazy with stomach-churning special effects and completely forget the hot, naked girls.

But what's missing: the tongue-in-cheek wit of those old drive-in films.  And the empty characters.  These are good actors in this film, but they're just not given any good characters or fun dialogue to deliver.

Better than I thought...but still missing the mark.  (Don't feel bad, guys: you did better than Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez did with their lame GRINDHOUSE project).",1325721600,,1431,4.8921161825726145

It was in this spirit that I purchased Piranha 3D (that, and I wanted some ""3D"" content to try out on my new 3D HDTV set up).

Well, I wasn't disappointed.  Piranha 3D is laughably bad.  The incredibly predictable script, the requisite ""I'm too stupid to get out of the water"" morons, and the misguided little kids - yes, this movie has all the ingredients needed for a true B-grade experience.  But fear not, there's more.  Incredible gore, a great scene involving a ""handheld"" outboard motor, and plenty of scantly clad young ladies.  Ahh yes, this movie has it all.

But in all seriousness, the ""3D"" aspect of this film left me underwhelmed.  Yes, it was ""cool"" in a few scenes, but overall, I don't know that it added much value.  I was left feeling sort of ""meh"" about the 3D effects.

Blood and gore galore.  Teenagers frolicking on the beach at spring break, silly obligatory side story, lots of gratuitous nudity (how this movie managed to get an R movie with all that boobage showing is beyond my comprehension), etc. etc. etc.  Bodies chewed into holes, ripped in half, savaged in ways you won't want to imagine.  You've seen it all a hundred times in a hundred other movies, most of them better done than this one.

The whole movie is in execrable taste.  Apparently one of the piranhas thought so too.  The funniest scene in the movie takes place when the piranha chows down on a private part of the male anatomy, burps it back up and spits it out.  That scene alone earns the movie a second star.

Ah remakes, they are some tricky little things. It seems like so many come out that you hate them all. You swear them all off and then a good one actually makes its way out. This kiddies is one such remake, one that is actually good. Of course with Alexandre Aja behind the boards you knew this was going to entertaining. I mean how could it not be as he really knows how to make these types of flicks. I knew this was going to be a fun ride.

The story follows some young people [of course] during spring break and a filmmaker [I guess]. They are all about partying, swimming, drugs, sex, and all those great things we are not supposed to do in public. Little do they know that there something has happened that has caused some prehistoric fish to come back. Naturally the party never stops even when warned but that only makes things more fun for us.

This is one of those meant to be fun flicks that were never meant to be taken seriously. If you went into this expecting a real dramatic scary flick then I know you were surprised. Of course any film that is in theaters as a 3-D flick can not be taken seriously in my opinion. Also how could a remake from a classic be anything but awesome fun. From the kills to the T&A this is just a popcorn flick.

Performances were as to be expected here as all were believable enough which is a good thing for these types of flicks. It was really great to see Christopher Lloyd  in this and even Richard Dreyfuss in a great cameo at the beginning. Any real movie buff should get that beginning, really you should. Can anybody say ""Jaws"", very good kiddies.

As for the kills you know there are plenty of those and they are great as one would expect. There is plenty of young flesh for these fish to rip into and they very much do. Also the film was made very well and looked really good, which I think added to it being really fun. It lost that Grindhouse look and feel of the original but its clean look adds to a false sense of security if that makes sense and the lightheartedness of this remake

I also love the special features for this film with a nice commentary and such but it is the in depth behind the scenes making of that I love. Over all this is a really fun flick that is highly entertaining. If you get the chance to check this out I say go for it and rent it or even buy it.

Piranhas devour people alive in this movie and that's the bottom line, folks...sexy Spring Break people to be more precise. And Matt Hooper from Jaws fame as well. You read that right, Richard Dreyfuss reprises his role as Matt Hooper from Jaws--okay, it's really a character named Matthew Boyd, but he's still pretty much dressed, acts and looks exactly like Matt Hooper from the original Jaws movie and he soon becomes fish food in the opening scenes of this very film.

If you have a queasy stomach that is easily upset by gross scenes of piranha-chomped human beings, then by all means avoid this movie at all costs. But otherwise, if you like an over-the-top monster flick that is loaded with gratuitous amounts of gore, nudity, and just plain silly and tasteless scenes of lowbrow entertainment, then this is the perfect movie for you.

While fishing in Lake Victoria, Arizona, Matt Boyd suddenly finds himself being sucked into the water by an enormous whirlpool that is caused by an earthquake tremor which cracks open the bottom of the lake floor bed and unleashes a horde of prehistoric bloodthirsty killer piranha that proceed to munch on him like he was the last meal on Earth. Soon the savage fish are free to wreak havoc on a group of unsuspecting young swimmers at a nearby Spring Break get together and that is when all hell really breaks loose.

Starring Christopher Lloyd as Doc Brown from Back to the Future, I meant to say Carl Goodman, but still basically playing another version of Doc Brown. Richard Dreyfuss as Matt Boyd, Ving Rhames as Deputy Fallon, Jerry O'Connell as dirtbag pornographer Derrick Jones, and believe it or not, Elisabeth Shue as Sheriff Julie Forester! That's two actors from the BTTF movies!

The gore doesn't bother us but the prolonged nude lesbians kissing underwater scene and repeated shots of women bouncing around in bikinis didn't do much for us.  The nudity/bikini scenes didn't add anything to the movie.  We are not prudish and we do understand that one of the main characters is a porn director...but still the two nude women making out and swiming together isn't erotic, entertaining or even attractive.  It was just pointless and didn't add anything to the movie.  We are assuming we are not their target audience.  The CGI effects were somewhat funny and not realistic but we forgave this because we did find it so bad it was humorous.  For some rather famous actors the acting was also laughable and somewhat lackluster.  Most of the gore was when people were attacked in/climbing out of the water so there was alot of skinless body parts.  We didn't get to see it in 3D so we aren't sure if the 3D aspect enhanced the movie in any way shape or form.  The plot is predictable with a bunch of party goers not listening to the sherrif's order to stay/get out of the water..so the bulk of the party goers turn into fish food or at least get munched on a few times.  There was one part that we did find funny and it is the main reason we gave it three stars..granted the part could be considered rather crude...we still got a laugh out of it because we had never seen a fish eat a certain part of male anatomy then burp it back up.",1319414400,2,1478,4.397058823529412

Here's another movie degrading women.  All the ways these girls were killed was disgusting.  Exposing their body parts up close and in full nudity or partial nudity was distasteful and sleezy.

Also seeing a man's private part being eaten by the piranha was sickening.  That part snuck up on me before I could fast forward the movie.  Did not see that coming, because I was looking at the movie on and off while I was typing.  What a pathetic pervert to add that in.

""Piranha"" is not just a bad film, it's one of the worst films of recent memory. It has camouflaged it's hateful, misogynistic package with a surprisingly good cast including Elisabeth Shue, Ving Rhames, Christopher Lloyd and Richard Dreyfuss (in an unfunny cameo which defiles the memory of the classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jaws-Two-Disc-30th-Anniversary-Edition/dp/B0008KLVG4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jaws (Two-Disc 30th Anniversary Edition)</a>). I don't know where to begin, but I would not be writing this review if I were not going to try.

A remake of the ingenious and immensely enjoyable 1978 Joe Dante film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Piranha/dp/6305596247/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Piranha</a>, this modern version transplants the story from the clear rivers and cypress trees of Central Texas to one of the most unsightly locales in the entire world, the dreary desert terrain of Lake Victoria, Arizona (really Lake Havasu), where not a tree or bird is to be found. Hollywood's modern version of spring break (as opposed to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Where-the-Boys-Are/dp/B0000EYUDE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Where the Boys Are</a>) is in full force where hundreds of faceless bikini babes shake their things for the camera for minutes at a time. College kids do body shots, suck down tequila, twirl beer bongs, dance, gyrate, expose themselves and ultimately act about as stupid as any victim could in order to be dog meat for a slasher film. Shue, as the town sheriff, is a strategic bit of casting in that you have a strong woman in a traditional male role giving filmmakers an excuse to detail with unblinking edits the gory slaughter of topless females. And in ""Piranha,"" the sexy ladies are scalped, decapitated, amputated and in one scene pulled apart. It's a pathetic, unspeakably miserable mess appealing to only the most hateful and shallow of teenage fanboys.

There's an earthquake, opening an underground lake where prehistoric piranha reside. Like water bugs, they promptly dart straight for the spring break shenanigans. The obligatory wet t-shirt contest is in full throttle where Eli Roth (in a role beyond his capabilities) is inserted as the gleeful host, squirting babes with a water hose who naturally turn around to be further doused during closeups of posterior areas. A Joe Francis, ""Girls Gone Wild""- type (Jerry O'Connell, that's right, Cushman the QB from ""Jerry Maguire"") takes the town by storm, renting a big boat and recruiting uninhibited drunk babes to film amateur softcore. Shue's son, (Steven R. McQueen, yes, the grandson of the late-great action star who himself kick-started his career with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blob-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/B00004W3HE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blob (The Criterion Collection)</a>), decides to hitch a ride because, who wouldn't want to see women in various forms of inebriation rollicking nude beneath a glass-bottom boat? And indeed, we are treated to an endless scene of two nude women swimming dolphin-like while passionately kissing and humping, evidently having learned to live without oxygen. It goes without saying, but I'll say it anyway - these women are torn to bloody pieces by the title creatures. Freaking cool dude!

I hate this film, not just because it has absolutely no respect for audiences or cinematic tradition, but because it makes the worst of Roger Corman's B-movie trash (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Creature-from-the-Haunted-Sea/dp/B0006FFR8Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Creature from the Haunted Sea</a>), Dante's drive-in tributes (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Howling-Special-Edition/dp/B00009OWI1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Howling (Special Edition)</a>) or even the 1976 ""Jaws"" rip-off&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grizzly/dp/B000CSTKDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grizzly</a>, seem like high art. There is no pace, concocted suspense, bad acting and a screenplay covered with beer and pizza stains. I've had to suffer through this refuse before, specifically Robert Rodriguez's average B-movie spoofs&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Machete/dp/B002ZG98C8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Machete</a>&nbsp;and the crappy first half of that&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grindhouse-Presents-Planet-Terror-Extended-and-Unrated-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000UAE7O0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grindhouse Presents, Planet Terror - Extended and Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>&nbsp;double feature. But at least Rodriguez is occasionally clever, even if his films are too over-the-top to be taken seriously. He's working for a pseudo-hip clique of desensitized social misfits who embrace juvenile stories mixed with extreme violence.

I suppose we should blame the endless cable glow of a spiritless bad-movie netherworld, almost completely lacking in mature romance, profound truths or mutual respect. This world of comic books and video games is devoid of compassion, existing solely for the amusement of 20-something men still in possession of teenage dispositions (think of overgrown kids going trick-or-treating). But ultimately the blame must fall upon the skinny shoulders of this film's director Alexandre Aja, whose credits prior to this trash includes the hideously awful 2006 remake&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hills-Have-Eyes-Unrated-Edition/dp/B000FAOC2W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hills Have Eyes (Unrated Edition)</a>. I should have known better, but alas I'm a gullible fan of horror films. One can always hope. But the sad, bitter fact is movie multiplexes across the continent are peopled by stupidly obese teenagers whose only exposure to culture is ""Transformers."" It's a sad, pathetic world, and filmmaking as an art form is degraded by such works as Aja's ""Piranha.""

As my brain and stomach revolted, I groaned and said, ""I can't believe I thought this would be an interesting film."" My girlfriend replied, ""What did you expect?!"" I don't know, ""The Mist,"" ""Insidious,"" ""The Descent?"" I suppose something more. ""Piranha"" is an unimaginably terrible film detailing a sad world, and one of the worst things I have ever been forced to endure.",1316476800,9,6736,6.720183486238532
4019897,3,B002ZG98L4,"The remake of Joe Dante's cult favorite, is an entertaining update with impressive practical effects, ample eye popping gore, tasteful nudity, and a parade of young hardbodies looking to have fun during spring break.  Directed by Alexandre Aja, one of the horror's hot up and comers, Piranha (2010) is not a great film, but it is a fun one, and Aja serves up a bloody good slice of exploitation cinema.

Aja's Piranha doesn't borrow too heavily from the original, as an earthquake has created an opening between an isolated underground cavern containing the piranha, and Lake Victoria above.  Before too long, the hungry fish are on the hunt, and with spring break coming up, the waters will soon be overloaded with college kids looking to party.  Cranking up the sleaze factor, the film features Jerry O'Connell as Derrick Jones, who has come to the lake with a couple of models, to shoot some footage for his Wild Wild Girls website.  O'Connell's winning performance as a slimeball elevates the film to high camp, creating a setting where other characters can truly shine.

Putting together those basic factors, you already have nicely lined up, the inevitable coed massacre that will turn the waters bright red.  Unfortunately, the central story is much too centered on the members of the Forrester family.  Julia Forrester (Elizabeth Shue) is the sheriff at Lake Victoria, who along with her deputies, and Novak (Adam Scott) a heroic scientist, is trying to get a handle on what is happening at the lake.  The Sheriff's eldest son Jake Forrester (Stephen R. McQueen) is hired by Jones to guide him to the great areas to shoot.  Tasked with babysitting his sister Laura (Brooklynn Proulx) and brother Zane (Sage Ryan), Jake follows his hormones and ditches his siblings.  Hoping to see more of Danni (Kelly Brook), one of Derrick's Wild Wild models, Jake is at the marina, when Derrick lasso's Jake's friend Kelly (Jessica Szohr) to join the festivities.  Joining the rest of the Forrester's on the water, Laura and Zane take a boat out on the lake, and get stranded on an island.  They too eventually end up on Derrick Jones' yacht.  There's just no controlling those wacky Forrester's!  The film also features some interesting performances in supporting roles, including Richard Dreyfuss as an unfortunate fisherman, Christopher Lloyd as a kooky and cranky marine biologist, Eli Roth as a sleazy wet t-shirt contest host, and an underused Ving Rhames as a deputy sheriff.

Some of the CG special effects are not particularly impressive, but the film definitely shines in the practical effects department, where there are massive quantities of chewed up body parts featured in the spring break piranha attack.  Combined with some solid action sequences and stunts, and the film delivers big time in the mayhem and gore department, taking the mass feeding frenzy to a whole new level, with the carnage reaching epic proportions.

Even the basic edition of the DVD, has nearly an hour's worth of solidly informative bonus material, that really helps you appreciate the film, and the effort and thought that director Alexandre Aja and his production team put into the final product.  While much of the plot is ridiculous, poorly written, and riddled with clichs, the characters mostly disposable and often unlikeable, and the dialog usually irritatingly dumb, you still have to give the film credit for being the pure bloodfest that it is.  However, when a piranha eats and then spits out a part of Derrick's anatomy, the film crosses a line that didn't need to be broached.  It can't be overstressed, that this film would be greatly diminished without the presence of Jerry O'Connell, who clearly stands far above anyone else in the film.  The Piranha remake rates 3.5 stars.

Making films like High Tension (2003), P2 (2007), The Hills Have Eyes (2006), and Mirrors (2008), Alexandre Aja and his frequent collaborator Gregory Levasseur, have been all around the horror genre.  Now that he has explored the creature feature, hopefully Aja will get serious, and consider a return to more hardcore horror.",1316304000,,4105,5.011782032400589

Piranha killings are done in a extreme fashion like the hills have eyes done by the same director. I see a lot of negative reviews for this movie as well as for other remakes.

4019899,3,B002ZG98L4,"""Piranha 3D"" is exactly what the title suggests, and it certainly delivers what it promises, but perhaps you should keep your expectations low. Remake of a 1978 Joe Dante film, the gory horror centers on the unsuspecting tourists, mostly young (and some half naked), partying during spring break at Lake Victoria, where a vicious species of prehistoric piranha (that was thought extinct) lives. There is gore aplenty in the new version directed by Alexandre Aja, French director of ""High Tension"" fame, but there is something missing here. Imagination that is essential to this kind of comedy horror, perhaps.

The story is simple. Jake Forester (Steven R. McQueen), 17-year-old high school boy and son of Sheriff Julie Forrester (Elisabeth Shue), is hired by a pornographer Derrick Jones (Jerry O'Connell) as a guide to show his crew and actresses around the lake. He and other travelers (including college students having fun at the lakeshore) are in big trouble when an earthquake unleashes a horde of piranha that has been living in the subterranean lake for 200,000 years. Well, this story sounds a bit familiar, you know.

""Piranha 3D"" begins with a cameo by Richard Dreyfuss, a tongue-in-cheek reference to his character in ""Jaws"" he played back in 1975. Obviously the director and the writers Pete Goldfinger and Josh Stolberg do not take the film too seriously. The original ""Piranha"" was after all a Roger Corman production, so why not? I am not saying the splatter horror is free from blood. It has lots of it, and mutilated bodies, too. But perhaps some viewers might prefer the director's intense scares in his earlier work (which you can find in the film's effective underground lake scene).

I am not particularly against the female nudity (lots of it, again). I don't hate the filmmakers' gore-and-laugh approach to the source material, either. But I really didn't like the film's clumsy storytelling. First, it is pretty easy to see who dies and who doesn't. Second, the bloodbath at the lake is at first impressive, but soon becomes boring, with so many people screaming and dying, but no coherent editing. Third, as no geographical information about the lake is given, we are not allowed to really feel the impending danger of the coming piranhas.

The film is not for everyone. I for one enjoyed watching ""Piranha 3D"" including the over-the-top acting of Christopher Lloyd and his character's not-so-convincing exposition, but the film could be much better with a careful narrative and creative ideas.",1315440000,,2521,5.067469879518073

So bad, it had to be remade for the current generation, and it fits perfectly with the idea of a 3D movie.

I bought the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Piranha-Blu-ray/dp/B0046YK3NU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Piranha [Blu-ray</a>] earlier this year (not expecting to get a 3DTV) and really enjoyed it.. After getting a 3DTV, I picked up this (3D) version.

You'll notice a lot of mixed reviews -- most seem to think the 3D was very well done, others complain of issues. At the time, I figured those complaining were just being picky about it, and took the chance -- that was a mistake.

The movie itself is very fun/campy and enjoyable in 2D or 3D. The problem comes with the 3D -- to start, it was a converted movie (filmed in 2D, converted to 3D). One of the biggest problems is ghosting.
Everything seems divided into layers (sort of like cardboard cutouts) - sometimes this works great, but most of the time you have issues where stuff isn't on the right layer. Most obvious/distracting is when a persons face is coming out towards you, but the top of their head or side of their face is stuck in the background (in what looks like several feet behind their head) - this happens with hair throughout (a girls curly hair might be 3D while some strands are several feet behind her mixed in with the background), or when they show part of the boat that's supposed to be in 3D, but part of the ocean behind it is also in 3D.
The 3D levels seem to mix throughout - sometimes you'll see many ""layers"" of 3D (foreground, middle ground, background, far away background), other times it seems like there are just 2 layers (foreground for the main subject and everything else (regardless of distance) is in the background).

It came off as very distracting to me. Fortunately, there were some fun 3D moments that worked great. Of the 10 3D movies I've seen, this was unfortunately the poorest one in terms of 3D effect. It could be due to it being a ""cheesy B-Movie"" or from the conversion of 2D -> 3D, but it seemed pretty poor at times.

The 3D version does contain a 2D version of the movie.. but you lose some deleted scenes (on the 2D version) which I found to be pretty good. Since both can be found for around the same price sometimes, it's up to you whether you'd rather have the 3D version of the deleted scenes.

Despite the 3D being somewhat poor in most parts, I think the 3D version is better than having the deleted scenes (if you plan to get a 3DTV). I wouldn't recommend re-buying it or paying much more for it over the 2D version though.

This is a ""check your brain at the door"" and enjoy kind of movie.  [B, for a good B-horror]

 Quite a cast: Richard Dreyfuss, Ving Rhames, Elisabeth Shue, Christopher Lloyd, Jerry O'Connell, Adam Scott, Dina Meyer, and a cameo by Eli Roth.  Was it worth it?  I think so!  This remake (which is at least as fun as the original) kicks off like Girls Gone Wild: Spring Break, foreshadowing gratuitous nudity for teenagers with Netflix across the globe.  Appropriately, Jerry O'Connell plays the ""Wild, Wild Girls"" director/producer who goes to a small, Spring Break-friendly lake town in the Southwest to make his fortune.  Meanwhile Elisabeth Shue and Ving Rhames play local cops trying to keep Spring Break order.  Good luck.

 This flick gets pretty Jaws-ish pretty fast.  Shue finds a body and considers closing the lake.  But the lake is too big of a Spring Break cash cow for her small town.  Back to funville, satirical gratuitous nudity has already begun in the form synchronized swimming performed by two ""Wild, Wild"" girls to an operatic soundtrack.  How tasteful.

 Now for some explanation of these piranhas' origin...
There's seismic activity which opened an underwater chasm, through which the piranhas escaped from an underwater lake, previously sealed off for a way like-dinosaur-long time.  Naturally, it's filled with eggs.  Some seismology researchers want to investigate but, come on?  Scuba-diving in a movie called Piranha?  They never stood a chance.

 Christopher Lloyd plays some dude who owns an aquarium store who, based on his level of expertise, holds a doctorate in fish systematics (naturally specializing on piranhas).  He instantly recognizes a captured specimen as representing a species which went extinct two million years ago.  An amateur paleontologist as well, hmmm?  He even has a fossil of that exact species in his store!  Shouldn't that be in a museum, bro?

 The CGI attacks are fun and better than any made-for-ScyFy Saturday night movies.  The kill-humor is 80's-chic and includes eyeballs being tugged from their sockets.  Some other kill-innovations include clever boat collisions, high tension wires, a girl getting scalped by a boat engine propeller, and a fish eating its way out of a person's mouth.  Breast implants, a severed penis and disembodied eyeballs drift about in this tidal chaos as well.  Oh, and a piranha eats and then belches out a dick, there are lots of ""halves"" of people, one woman is ""accidently"" torn in half by her rescuers, and a dude walks on his bone foot.  Nothing but fun, folks!!!  I'm giving you pearls here!

What happens to O'Connell is absolutely priceless and even the very last moment of the movie is hilarious!  I enjoyed this so much that I ordered it the same day and, with a little beer, I'd gladly watch it with friends two nights in a row.  It's that fun.",1310083200,,3059,4.994047619047619

The video was excellent, but more vivid than most Blu-Ray movies.  I usually watch movies with my TV picture set to ""Vivid"", but with this movie, I changed it to ""Standard"".  2.40:1.

The DTS-HD Master 5.1 audio was about the best surround sound I've ever heard.

4019964,5,B002ZG98L4,"In a large Arizona lake called Lake Victoria, a fisherman (Richard Dreyfuss) was minding his own business fishing until an Earthquake occurs even in the lake and unbreaks small caverens as hundreds of deadly prehistoric man-eating Piranhas come out from the water and eat him. Springbreak has occured for all the college and high school students as they party down like there's no tommorow, Sheriff Julie Forster (Elizabeth Shue) does her usual police duty as her teenage son Jake (Steven R. Mcqueen) sneeks off to see the filming of a porno film by sleazoid director Derrick (Jerry O'Connel). Sheriff Forster and a crew discover the underground caverns and brings back one of the piranhas to a researcher named Mr. Goodman (Christopher Lloyd) to know what kind of fish it is. Can Forster and her assitant Deputy Fallon (Ving Rhames) save the day as they will destroy the piranhas or will Lake Victoria be forever a feeding ground for those hungry scaled critters?

A brilliant and hilarious yet gory as hell reimagining of Roger Corman's 1978 campy Sci-fi horror comedy Jaws parody is a great throwback to exploitation of the 70's and 80's  where things are no holds bar. Director Alexandra Aja who made the 2003 French cult horror hit ""High Tension"", the excellent 2006 remake of ""Hills Have Eyes"" and the enjoyable ghost movie ""Mirrors"" has made his finest most acclaimed movie yet. I saw this baby last year in theaters in 3D 2 times and it was worth the hype and praise it got, it's a sexy and wild bloodbath. There's a very sexy and artistic scene where two bisexual girls are getting to know each other in the water in the nude which will please every guy there is, the acting is good and i also love the intensity this movie pulls you though. There's lots of nudity in this one with hot girls and tons of gore galore from flesh-eating, castration, face mutilation and anything you desire if your a gorehound. The film co-stars Kelly Brook, Eli Roth and Rilley Steele, the film also has a heart pounding climax that will leave you on the edge of your seat as that is what Aja was intending for this movie to be as a fun good time for guys who like horror movies with a bit of dark comedy.

The Blu-Ray is perfection at it's finest on theatrical quality picture and sound that is outstanding especially when you hear screams of people. The extras include a very insightful audio commentary, deleted scenes with optional commentary, 10 featurettes, deleted storyboard sequences, Trailers and TV spots and BD-Live.",1306800000,2,2518,4.744292237442922
4019965,4,B002ZG98L4,Not a lot out there to choose from 3d wise. As far as 3 d effects go this was good.  Way to much naked boobies in this flick (unless you are male). I did enjoy the carnage as seen through a 3d lens. Very entertaining,1306627200,,216,3.8
4019966,1,B002ZG98L4,"After seeing the multitude of reviews praising the quality of the film's '3d effects', I decided to give it a shot. Unlike the latest Resident Evil 3D film, which was also destroyed by critics, but heralded for the beautiful use of James Cameron's 3d technology, this film is in no way a realistic representation of dimension. Objects from the background poke through past objects in the foreground. The rotoscoped edges of faces and bodies are warped and inaccurate. Landscapes are chopped up into individual layers much like slices of flat paper. It's insanely bad.

Ignore the positive reviews regarding the 3D. This is the only 3d conversion I've seen that turned out worse than Clash of the Titans. This film was NOT shot in 3D.

4020011,4,B002ZG98L4,"Okay, this isn't a great or even that good of a film in the strictest sense of the word.  It's not even trying to be.  It's over the top in its themes and in its characters and absolutely in it's gore.  It's basically French director Alexandre Aja's reaction to the American centric and totally bizarre ritual of teen Spring break partying.  Trust me, I understand his confusion regarding this ritual.  I too think it's moronic, dull and absolutely hysterical.  He basically plops that concept in your face, with an abundancy of free range boobs(just like the real life Spring break), and adds prehistoric Piranhas into the mix to thankfully murder and mutilate these teenaged morons in all their bloody and annoying glory.  Wish I had thought of it.

Okay, this is technically a remake, but not really.  The producers and director constantly point out in the featurettes and the commentary that this is not a remake of the Roger Corman/John Sayles/Joe Dante directed camp classic Piranha.  But then again, the original Piranha was the satirical and only on a superficial rip-off of the Jaws frenzy of the 70's, and it was made just in time to capitalize on the upcoming release of Jaws 2.  As Corman has stated before, sure he was capitalizing on Jaws, but he had been making movies with Jaws' premise for years, just on a WAY smaller budget.  So fair is fair to me.  Yes, it has the same title as the original Piranha.  Yes, it's about killer Piranhas attacking innocent swimmers....but that's about it.  This time out we get dormant prehistoric piranhas(absolutely silly and priceless) released during an earthquake and that make their way to Spring break for some lunch.  That's it.

Jerry O'connell is great as a sort of 'Girls Gone Wild' sleazebag producer who intices a few of our hero teens onto his boat.  We get cops played admirably if not spectaculary by Elizabeth Shue(where the hell has she been), and Vig Rhames, and Christopher Lloyd as a wacky(what else would he play) fish shop owner who helps out in the exposition department at one point.  We get some moppets in danger, some nude starlets and losts of fish munching action.  Right off the bat we get a great and knowing cameo from Richard Dreyfuss as the film's first fish snack pack.  It's fun, funny and exciting, and I'm surprised Dreyfuss was a good enough sport to do the scene. We even get a familar song on his radio as the scene starts(Tell Me the Way To Go Home anyone).  That's it.  Cheap thrills.  Not a brain cell in the movies entire being.

The blu ray is loaded and very satisfying.  There's a five part featurette about the entire production from the sets, location scouts, script, and of course KNB's awesome gore effects, and of course the CGI fishies.  We also get some deleted scenes that are mostly useless, but there are a few that better introduce the Christopher Lloyd character and give him a meatier reason for being in the film.  Wish the Lloyd scenes had stayed in, but the rest were safe cuts.  There's also a shared commentary with director Aja and one of the film's producers.  I really wish Aja had done the commentary on his own.  The producer he shares it with obviously, as per usual it seems, doesn't really care or 'get' the genre, but was more into getting on the money train of the current horror express.  Blah, it's just annoying to listen to people who work and make money in a genre that i love barely have any knowledge or serious interest in it.

I don't have the 3-D version.  Never will.  I don't care about 3-D.  I am over the age of ten.  I don't need visual gimmicks, interactivity, or sideshow theatrics for me to enjoy or be enticed to view ANY movie.  I don't get, or care about it.  I like movies taking me in, not jumping off the screen at me to make sure, in case I forget and got enveloped in the film's story at any point, that I am totally watching a movie.  Can't wait for this boring fad to fade away.

This film is low concept and trashy.  Beware all you prudes there is tons of gore and nudity in the film(my favorite being a nude underwater ballet that is hysterical).  The gore is gross and in your face, but it's not disturbing due to the fact that it's soooo over the top.  The nudity involved bare breasts, and, well, that's really all you need to know.  They're plentiful and glorious.

This is perfect fast food horror cinema that aspires to be nothing more than entertaining and outrageous.  It does this.  The ending of the film feels abrupt and unsatisfying to me.  Sure, it could be sequel bait, or just one final cynical joke, but I would've liked a big kick butt finale to match the film's third act massacre at the Spring Break location.  But, with the feature and the special features this blu ray is a solid four stars with a goofy and childish grin to go with them.",1303862400,,4816,4.536585365853658

4020013,4,B002ZG98L4,"Some of the negative reviews here are quite astounding. I am curious as to what expectations anyone has about a movie called Piranha that were not met. Piranha? Check. People getting eaten by said Piranha? Check. Gratuitious nudity? Check. Ridiculous campy, gory fun? Check. I think the positive reviews are positive for the same reason that the negative reviews are negative. It's simply a matter of the film finding its audience. Alexandre Aja's Piranha is a throwback to the horror films of the 70s and 80s, less politically correct times when horror films were filled with excessive violence and sex. The only thing missing from Aja's film is a drive-in to watch it in. Or, rather, occasionally watch it when you're not attempting to get to first base with the girl in your passenger seat.

Though I do admire Aja's film, I would also recommend its insipration, Joe Dante's 1978 Piranha. The original film was produced by Roger Corman's New World Pictures basically as a B-movie answer to Spielberg's Jaws. A highly entertaining low budget film it is. Aja's 2010 film unfortunately does not have the legendary cult cast. No Dick Miller. No Kevin McCarthy. No Paul Bartel. No Barbara Steele. Instead we have Ving Rhames, Christopher Lloyd, Elisabeth Shue, Jerry O'Connell (unlikable as always). There is also a brief but enjoyable pre-credits appearance from Richard Dreyfuss reprising his Jaws character, Matt Hooper. I must also mention some of the movie's greastest special effects. The ones which have nothing to do with fish. Kelly Brook, Riley Steele and, my personal favorite, the amazing Gianna Michaels.

Piranha is a fun, cheesy, gory movie about man-eating Piranha. And they do eat man and woman alike, (not to mention manhood). That's all it promises, and it delivers. This is the kind of picture I would love to see more of these days. Oh and casting directors -- please hire Gianna Michaels often!!",1303344000,,1915,5.0

So why are people so shocked and offended with the content.  It wasn't meant to be as Shakespeare or Jane Austin.
This film delivers rollicking good laughs, a predictable plot, with loads of skin and gore.  I laughed from the start (with a great cameo bit by Dreyfuss) to finish.

4020015,1,B002ZG98L4,"What I noticed while watching this is that like many of his other movies, the director tends to overplay the sex and gore. Some of these killing scenes are so overly graphic they're completely ridiculous and impossible. To give one example the ""fish through the mouth"" thing. This was just a scene put in for a 3D gore effect. It's impossible. It didn't go through the back of the skull and it couldn't have fit through the throat..and her actually yelling? Even more impossible, she'd have no vocal chords left.

If you're a fan of watching girl/girl porn and graphic gory massacre scenes in 3D, you'll probably like this. For me, after I skipped over the porn, I then went through the movie and picked all the mistakes out. This is what I get for studying forensic science. ""You can't kill a person like that. It's impossible.""

The sherriff, her deputies, and Novak were good characters though. Let's see other than that, think I wanted to see the fish that choked on the porn director's d! ck turn belly up and die from it. (or at the very least have one of its siblings doing the heimlech, smacking it and griping about the parts they're not supposed to eat..)And the while I'm on that note, who the heck gets an erection while they're being torn apart by pirahnas?!

4020105,1,B002ZG98L4,"Having seen the previews last summer, I was kind of bummed when I didn't get around to catching this on the big screen.  I loved the original as a kid, and this remake looked like it would be seriously badass.  Ving Rhames kickin' pirahna ass, I was sold.  Well, just rented it and what a letdown!

Where to start?

- Here's the opening DVD menu, where we're shown tons of half naked women dancing outdoors to some generic club beat, but no killer fish, none, nada, nothing.  This is a horror flic, right?  If there hadn't been a ""Pirahna"" title thrown in, I probably would have thought I'd gotten the wrong movie.  Maybe that's the producers' way of warning us?

- Opening death scene with Matt Hooper (Dreyfuss)... wow, another warning for us right from the get-go: the CGI in this movie is gonna be REALLY BAD.  I mean, this is Sharktopus territory, possibly worse...  The pirahna are so cartoony looking, it's laughable (not in a good way).  And sorry, but CGI blood just does not work.

- Plot is total crap.  Okay, so I'm a fan of real grindhouse, gore, etc, and I am very forgiving on things like plot, acting, etc, in films like this.  But have at least something for us to chew on.  Especially if your effects are going to suck so bad.

- Zero tension.  There is little to no horror, edge of your seat excitement, or suspense in this movie.  They try to make up for this by upping the gore, which doesn't really work.  I mean, you can only see so many eyeballs ripped out, bodies torn to shreds, etc, before it's just numbingly dull.  There are a few gore scenes that are creative, but for the most part, it's just sorta 'there'.  As I said, the fish aren't scary (unless things like Saturday morning cartoons scare you), just silly.  Is this movie a joke, is it a horror movie, is it soft porn?  It doesn't really deliver on any of those levels.

- Nudity to the point of being boring.  I don't mind nekkid chics at all, certainly not in the average R-rated horror flic, but a five-minute scene of underwater naked women to some silly classical music score, pshhhhhh... Once again, did they give me the right movie here??  ...and the women looked very airbrushed as well.  I guess they didn't look 'good enough' as they were.  Not to mention they broke one of the cardinal rules of horror.  If you have massive nudity in a scene, it should always end with a particularly nasty death.  For a film that is supposed to deliver to a target audience, you'd think they'd know that.  Instead, the girls swim, get out of the water, do drugs, blah blah blah.  Where the hell are these pirahna when you need them??

- Underuse of badass Ving Rhames.  What a shame.  I loved this guy in the Dawn of the Dead remake, and was looking forward to some kind of a reprise of that role.  There was a shotgun involved, and an 'okay' scene of him with a boat propeller, but other than that, pretty much he takes a back seat to cheesy club dancing on boats.  The Christopher Lloyd character could have been utilized much better as well, while we're at it.  Perhaps as a homage to the scientist in the original film.

That's about it.  I guess if you're 12 years old and need an excuse to see some playboy-style nudity, this will be your cup of tea.  I feel kinda bad for you if you are an adult and watching this for the nude scenes.  But that must be the audience that is being catered to, so I guess there's alot of folks out there like that.  There's certainly not any horror or real excitement to be found.  My advice, rent it first for a $1 at Redbox.  I would not recommend buying this piece o' poop.

Remember the ""All You Can Eat Fish Fry"" at your local restaurant?  The pirhanas do. Actually, they get it backwards and the movie becomes an All You Can Eat Co-Ed Buffet, with lots of screaming, fountains of blood, gobbets of floating flesh, enough internal organs to teach an anatomy class, and a bargeful of severed appendages---including the well-chewed penis of a porn actor---In absolutely-yucko-bucko 3-D!

For a summer sexploitation film it has a very good cast (including Dreyfuss, Shue and Christopher Lloyd).

I LIKED THIS MOVIE simply because it was done right:

@ Decent Cast

@ Decent Script

@ Decent Plot

You cannot have a Decent Cast without a Decent Script and you can't have a Decent Script without having a Decent Plot, without these three, you are going to have a terrible movie no matter how hard you try so that being said, you have your garden variety all-star cast in a horror film, who would've thought?

And in the beginning of the film, we have the great Richard Dreyfuss paying homage to one of his greatest films, JAWS, out in a boat singing ""Show me the way to go home"" before.....well, I won't ruin it for you but let's just say his visit on the water is short!

I should include a warning here so here it goes:

WARNING: This film is NOT for small children or for larger kids who are prone to nightmares after seeing such films, I asked my 15 year old grandson if he wanted to watch it with me and he told me, ""No, it'll give me nightmares!"" so, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!, this film is QUITE GRAPHIC and doesn't spare the viewer in the blood department or the entrails department.

The cast members that do survive, do a great job acting wise......
Elisabeth Shue is great as a Sheriff, however, that is not quite the role I had her pegged in when I saw her name on the sleeve, maybe a scientist or a life guard or something but most definitely NOT a Sheriff.

Christopher LLoyd comes off brilliantly as what else?, a scientist, nothing much has changed since his BTTF days.

Jerry O'Connell plays a ""Girls Gone Wild"" Type producer, quite the obnoxious one in the film until.....well I won't spoil it for you but it is a riot!

I could've sworn I caught the kid that plays Axl on the hit series THE MIDDLE in this as well, it was wierd seeing him play a straight teenager instead of the dorky one he plays on the TV show, which is a great show BTW but that's another review altogether.

All in all, this movie gets two thumbs up from me, oh one more thing, the stars of the film, THE FISH, or better named, Piranhas, they look quite prehistoric in nature and very pissed off as well.

I will comment on one criticism I had of the film and that was the part where the scientists called to investigate strange goings on in the lake, discover a cavern, opened up by an earthquake in the beginning of the film and in the cavern, they discover all of these weird objects, that look like round cylinders, you'll soon figure out what they are, I won't give it away here but after they piss off the occupants, nothing is done about that cavern for the rest of the film, seems troublesome to me and the only answer I can come up with is: SEQUEL!

I recommend this film, it will probably end up getting seen by me way more than once.",1296604800,,2982,4.243816254416961

The fish, who lived in the cavern should have been blind, a point missed by the producer who was too busy recruiting porn stars, Ashlynn Brooke, Gianna Michaels, and Riley Steele for cameos. Yes there is nudity and lots of it, including underwater full frontal and a severed male organ being devoured by our prehistoric fish. The boat used in the movie has the name ""Barracuda."" The actors can't help the bad script. There is plenty of blood and devoured bodies, especially the bottom half. Lots of underwater, fish eye views.

However, it is actually remade here by ballsy contemporary gore peddler Alexandre Aja (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-Tension/dp/B000ARFPMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High Tension</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hills-Have-Eyes/dp/B000FAOC2W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hills Have Eyes</a>).  I like Aja's serious horror films because he makes it impossible to trust his movies and is willing to mangle his heroes and heroines in cold and brutal ways.  He's capable of being a terrifying filmmaker and I love that about him, but here he is brought in to make his hardcore horror fans laugh, and I have to ask why?  Especially when the only reason anything could be seen as funny is because of simply how far Aja is willing to push the limits of decency.  How many people can be eaten by fish?  How much blood and torn-up flesh can fit into one aerial shot?  How long can two nude women spread their legs and hold their breath?  Can Jerry O'Connell's nether regions really be gobbled up, spat out, and then eaten again?  These are questions I just don't care about but hey it's in 3-D, right?  Yeah, so let's go!

Piranha 3-D's plot is simple.  An ancient breed of fish is released after a small earthquake opens an underwater rift.  This happens right around the time Spring Break begins, you know where all the sodomites come out to drink and get naked in various bodies of water all around the world.  So yeah, they deserve to be eaten by cartoon fishies with big snarly teeth, right?  Well these kids do because they are less authentic then their primitive aquatic co-stars and about as likable as the cast of MTV's Jersey Shore.  So yeah, to summarize; naked people get eaten by fish.

The thing that really makes Piranha bad is its lead actor, Steven R. McQueen.  Now it could be that he simply doesn't care because of the kind of film he was in, but in order for schlock like this to actually work you really need a lead that is capable of either playing it straight in the most dead pan way possible or actually outdoing the campiest of campy supporting cast members.  Quite a task actually because one of the film's bright spots is Jerry O'Connell's sleazy Joe Francis-like pornographer character.  He is a boorish and silly quasi-rapist slithering around in his speedos, and few characters deserve their comeuppance like he does.  All in all, the horrible CGI and unreal 3-D effects make Piranha fake enough that the film needed more than empty one-dimensional stereotypical characters to support its pathetically lacking story.  I still won't say I hated Piranha 3-D because I let out at least half a dozen belly laughs, albeit some were no doubt unintended by the folks behind the scenes.",1296259200,,3125,5.296146044624747
4020334,3,B002ZG98L4,"The movie is what you expect: a spectacle of blood, gore, and nudity.  Oh, the nudity! There is nothing new in the story that you haven't seen before, so the reason that I bought it was for the 3D.  But this is where I was sorely disappointed:  the 3D effects are not nearly what I thought they would be. I was expecting tons of fun, cheesy effects shooting out of the screen, but there is very little of that. I wanted some 3D piranhas coming at me so close I could grab them, some chopped-off limbs, but a lot of the movie is simply 2D-like with some backgrounds in 3D. What comes out of the screen is very limited and not all that well done.

So the entertainment factors goes down a lot since I had such high hopes for the 3D. The movie still has entertainment factor due to the somewhat funny and gruesome way people get eaten up, but as a 3D marvel, it's a bit of a letdown.

Plot: Lake Victoria, a thriving community that prospers greatly every spring break, but this year, an abundance of uninvited guests has arrived. You see, the day before the springtacular event took place an earthquake shook up the area causing an underwater, closed off cavern to open and release scores of flesh eating, penis hungry, blood thirsty.... Piranhas can the drunken spring breakers be smart enough not to go in the water, can the sheriff save her kids from their fishy shenanigans that could quite possibly lead to a grisly demise.... You'll have to find out.

Review: Ever since I heard about this movie back in 2009 I've was psyched to view it, then the day came.... I remember that it was supposed to come out on August 28th but it was pushed back to August 20th and boy was I excited.... I viewed it in 2010 and had a blast in the theater. The movie had everything, hot and sexy woman, tons of graphic/bloody gore, a good cast, decent CG fish, and a massacre scene that was incredible, the movie gave off a modern vibe and it was a different take on Piranha.... If I were to pick my favorite movie either Piranha '78 or Piranha 3D '10 I'd go with Piranha 3D for one main reason, it was able to do stuff that the original Piranha could never do and don't get me wrong, they gave it their all to make the original Piranha and I adore the classic to this day I just enjoyed this version of Piranha better. The CG fish in the movie changed drastically every time there was new footage (The Teaser, The Official Trailer, The Comic Con Footage and the Movie.)  But in the End result the Piranhas in the final cut looked the best next to the Trailer in comparison. This was definitely a success at the box office, not only did it make nearly $90,000,000 but it also created buzz and more creature features started going to theaters (Shark Night 3D, Bait  3D) and it even had a rip off (Mega Piranha). The 3D, I remember not really minding it too much but then again I was so enthralled in the movie that I didn't bother to notice, as you can probably tell I was a bit over hyped for this movie.

Acting: Kelly Brook was my favorite character, not only because she was ridiculously hot but also because of her personality, she obviously was attracted to Jake (Steven R. McQueen) but she also saw that he dug Kelly (Jessica Szohr) so she did everything in her power to put them together, I loved her character to death, hell I loved all the characters from Richard Dreyfuss to Christopher Lloyd, I know that a lot of people disliked Derrick (Jerry O' Connell) but I thought he played the part just right!

Gore: Blood is everywhere in this movie, we get graphically chewed up bodies, disgusting corpses, a body is sliced in half, a piranha eats its way through a girls stomach and exits out her mouth, a severed penis, a crushed head, severed limbs everywhere and a whole lot more, It really never disappointed me in this department.

Bottom Line: This is my favorite B-Movie.... It is not only done perfect but it is shot well and looks great, it belongs with every B-Movie lover and I don't think the same way about a B-Movie about fish ever again!

Rated R for sequences of strong bloody horror violence and gore, graphic nudity, sexual content, language, and some drug use

I was a little leery of the CGI fish I saw in them, but fortunately they look more convincing in the film. What's not to like here? From the start we get Richard Dreyfuss in full Matt Hooper gear and singing the famous drunken sailor song from Jaws(""show me the way to go home...."") paying homage to the greatest animal attack film of all time, sitting in a boat on the water....you just know this is not going to turn out good!

The film starts off running and never lets up and even though the first piranha attack looks too cartoon-ish for my taste, it soon turns into a bloody good mess with tons of T and A thrown in for good measure! The film is very funny with lots of nods to Jaws down to the way certain scenes are shot. I say this is a funny film, but don't think you're going to get off that easy because this film is extremely gory with some very convincing gross out FX! Fortunately(for the guys), there is lots of nude chicks to take our minds off of such unsettling horror! :-D!

I really enjoyed this film and for what it is and it deserves a lot of praise, but......it could have been so much more if it had been played straight at times. It has that kind of potential, to be something truly memorable. This is a good film to grab some beers and a bunch of your friends and have a great time! Babes, booze and blood!...a nice combination if you ask me!

Set during Spring Break on an inland lake, with several of main charters involved in the shooting of a Girls Gone Wild type video the amount of nudity in the first half of movie is high.
This could be forgiven as a way of catching the audiences attention or as a plot tool if the script was not so predictable.  To the point you know who will die as soon as they appear on screen.  The obnoxious jocks who bully the main teen character, the women involved in the girls gone wild video.  The characters are cardboard stereotypes.
The original Piranha was a B movie, nobody could ever of called it a film great.  However, this remake is sadly lacking against the original. Relying more on gore and nudity than trying to create tension or anything new.
It strikes me as the target audience is in their teens to early 20's and male.
With that in mind if you do buy this movie to see some bare boobs the best scene is about 25 - 26 minutes into the movie.  2 women swimming nude underwater while classic music plays.

Adhering strictly to the plot requirements of the genre, ""Piranha"" nevertheless stretches the boundaries with outstanding photography, thrilling action sequences, and an excellent cast. The nudity, while raising the bar for all such movies,  should be viewed in the context of artificial nudity since its apparent silicone or saline enhancements render it comedic rather than erotic. While not a fan of said part enhancements, they do, as a consequence of their buoyancy, add considerable grace to a stunningly beautiful underwater ballet.

The movie was accompanied by the most long-winded special features I have ever seen, making for an astonishing amount of content for this exceptionally reasonable price.

I decided to order this as soon as it was available January 11 2011 on Amazon. Thank you Amazon for shipping this promptly. What a classic ""old school"" 70's horror movie. It had all the gore,nudity,and horror comedy what can be known as 'black comedy"". See, I am 43 and I grew up as a kid in the 1970's. These were the days of ""Night of the Living Dead"", and ""Squirm"". This movie centers on a beach community during Spring Break,and they are beset by an attack of killer piranha. What I loved was the set up before the attack and gore.the movie showed a bunch of rambunctious college students partying away like nothing bad will ever and can ever happen to them in life,Although,women may be offended at this movie inasmuch as it does objectify women as ""bimbo's"" in bathing suits to be lusted after,the firts half of the movie with the partying adds to the eventual suspense. Everything seems just swell.sex.drugs and rock n roll until the attack of the piranha. What ensues is awesome gore. The major scene where the piranha attack a group of partygoers has so much gore and suspense. Lots of mangled bodies and blood. You do not see this anymore in Hollywood movies because the studios want a PG 13 rating to sell the movie more. The nudity in the movie with the gore is reminiscent of the 1970's in film when studios were more liberal. What was classic as well in the film, was the deliberate silly,funny parts in the gore. True many old school horror movies were silly and campy-almost self deprecating. Moreover,there is a classic theme of the hero boy who eventually saves the woman=prince charming theme of some horror movies. Lastly, to see such beautiful,sexy females in bathing suits turn into mangled bodies by being eaten by piranha is alarming and truthfully shocking. This movie is really gory and has a good story. I was not bored at all during the movie it moved at a good pace. The performances were well done by the actors and actresses. I highly recommend this movie. It is rare to see a movie with a ""hard"" R rating these days. This movie bring 2011 back to the 1970's. Highly recommended. Don't miss it.

That's because Piranha packs more bare boobs and dismembered body parts than any ten ordinary horror movies!

Unfortunately, the work of plastic surgeons is displayed as prominently here as the effects of the CGI wizards, but for the teenaged boys who have never seen natural boobs, it may not matter...

Mostly this film is a hoot, but it's not the classic that Jaws was.  Piranha suffers from a lack of character development and interesting information about piranhas.

But the film does boast unique pleasures, notably the stunt casting of the first victim, plus the always welcome appearance of Christopher ""Doc Brown"" Lloyd as the local piranha expert and pet store owner.

The film gets bonus points too for the scene in which Deputy Sheriff Ving Rhames, hefting a roaring outboard engine, mows down scores of hungry piranha in the water.

Last but not least, this release is welcome proof that DVDs can still pack plenty of extra features, here a director's commentary and full ninety-minute making-of featurette.  Bravo!  I'm texting you, Machete -- there's no reason except corporate greed that your DVD included just a few brief deleted scenes!!!

The featurette makes you appreciate how much expert work went into the onscreen mayhem here.  About the only fault I could find was the short shrift given the piranha themselves.  These are some scary suckers, and I would have liked to have seen how they were designed and realized.

4020468,3,B002ZG98L4,"It's been a long, long time since I've seen the original, but I remember it being a rather cookie-cutter approach to the genre, capitalizing on the success of ""Jaws."" This is really no different other than the producers set it during spring break in Arizona. With the ""R"" rating, and the copious amounts of nude female flesh on display, there is little question concerning the target audience.

Save for Richard Dreyfuss' cameo in the opening (reprising his singing of 'Show Me the Way to Go Home' from ""Jaws""), and a couple of scenes with Christopher Lloyd, the only other actors of note here are Elisabeth Shue as the Sheriff and Ving Rhames. I find it odd they'd be in a flick like this because it's entirely exploitative.

In a nutshell: It's Spring Break at Lake Victoria in Arizona. An earthquake opens a rift under the lake tying it to an even deeper lake that is home to an ancient form of Piranha. Said Piranha check out their new home and and all the delicacies it has to offer.

This version pays homage to/ steals from a host of other movies. It's a bit of fun noting the various references and, being a red-blooded American dude, seeing all the lovely females in their natural glory isn't at all hard on the eyes either. There's a lot of torn flesh, near misses, kids in danger and so on. But the producers knew what they were looking for and it delivers in spades. This is by no means a great flick. It's Saturday matinee trash for big kids.

It's directed well enough and many of the goo effects are genuinely good. It has all the right thrills in all the right places, and all the characters who deserve to get eaten (and some who don't) get eaten.

Movie commentary.  But that is also offered on the regular DVD.  So what are some of the extras?  Deleted scenes, several storyboards that didn't make it into scenes in the movie.  TV spots.  But perhaps the major feature is an over two hour feature on the making of the movie, in all aspects.  This feature is longer then the actual movie, and for those interested in how the movie is made, is well worthwhile.  The main annoying part of this feature is that they continually talk about having always the best of the best for this and that part of making the film.  Fine, except the movie didn't do all that well at the box office, and I doubt it will be winning many Oscars.

4020545,4,B002ZG98L4,"35 years ago a movie appeared that began a genre of its own. Loosely based on the horror genre that used any animal from killer shrews to giant ants, the film featured Mother Nature gone wild and becoming the most terrifying of all creatures. That film was JAWS and the movies that paid tribute to in whether directly or not is long. GRIZZLY, TENTACLES and the original PIRANHA all used the set up of a town making money due to the holiday influx of people only to be confronted with a menace putting them all in danger.

Fans of those films, in particular the gory horror films of the eighties, have been making movies that they remember from their childhoods. And now we have one of the better homage to those films with the new version of PIRANHA. Director Alexander Aja states in the extras on this DVD that he loved those movies and saw a chance to offer a tribute to them. He does an exceptional job here. But be warned, this movie is not for kids at all. The extreme combination of nudity and gore make it one for adults only.

The story focuses on spring break in the community of Lake Victoria. Every year thousands of teens commandeer the beaches there to celebrate, which of course for them involves taking off clothes and consuming extreme amounts of alcohol. The woman in charge of keeping order is Sheriff Julie Foster (Elizabeth Shue). Sheriff Foster's job is usually pretty calm but spring break offers all sorts of new trouble.

Foster's son is Jake (Steven R. McQueen), about to graduate high school and always tied down babysitting his siblings during spring break which keeps him out of trouble as well. But this year Jake grabs an opportunity when home video producer Derrick Jones (Jerry O'Connell) hires him as a guide to the lake. Jones is shooting a film, one of the many Girls Gone Wild knockoffs. Yes, Jake gets a chance at seeing naked women and alcohol just like the rest of the kids.

Along for the ride is the object of Jake's affection, Kelly (Jessica Szohr), now a college student and home for break. These two have an obvious affection for one another that for one reason or another never saw the light of day. Her acceptance of a trip on the Derrick's boat doesn't make Jake happy but what can he say now that he works for him?

At the opening of the film we witness a minor underwater earthquake that opens up a subterranean lake that releases the titled menace, a prehistoric piranha that is more dangerous than those around today. Its first victim (in what is perhaps the best cameo since Bill Murray in ZOMBIELAND) is Richard Dreyfuss in a minor tribute to his role as Matt Hooper in JAWS. That alone makes this one worth watching.

When a scientific group comes in to check out the seismic activity that happened underwater, they're the first to officially discover the piranha. Now the Sheriff has no choice but to close the beaches. Of course we know how well that will go over. In one of the most extremely gory scenes of carnage ever filmed the spring breakers ignore the demand to get out of the water and summarily become chow for the rampaging fish. Body parts and blood are everywhere so fans of that will be pleased. Non-fans may find fascinating the way they make it all seem so real.

While the initial attack is going on, Jake and his new friends find themselves in danger as well. Having rescued his siblings (who snuck out and got stuck on an island after ignoring his warning to stay home), their boat crashes and is sinking slowly. Setting aside the fact he snuck out as well for the job, he contacts his mother to come to their aid.

A simple enough story, right? But it all works and works well. The characters are simple ones that could have been cardboard cutouts but each is given enough meat on their bones to make them real. And the acting by everyone involved, from the aforementioned actors to Ving Rhames as Shue's deputy and Christopher Lloyd as a semi-mad scientist who studies fish, isn't lame and makes each one believable.

I saw this film when it was released in 3D and even in 2D it works. My initial reaction was that it was a bit hokey but on second viewing the film actually has some scary moments. The pacing, direction, photography, all are top notch here, especially some of the underwater photography and special effects shots.

All in all the film is a great evening's entertainment for horror and non-horror fans alike. But as I stated earlier, the film has some realistic gore moments and tons of nudity. For the record let me state that exposed breasts in 3D look the same in 2D. While the film makers state (in the extras) that they were paying tribute to the horror movies of the 80s that had both tons of gore and nudity, none had them to the extreme offered here. But if you can get past those two items, you'll find a movie that offers scares, humor and a great production that makes it worth the price of rental if not purchase.",1294704000,,4918,4.515730337078652

The Hills Have Eyes, Mirrors (to a degree), and now Piranha 3-D; which by all rights and purposes is a surprisingly enjoyable horror dirge that delivers the goods in terms of bare breasts and shredded, bloody flesh.  Elisabeth Shue stars as the sheriff of a small town whose annual Spring Break bash means feeding time for the recently released race of thought-extinct piranhas that are now swimming around, which doesn't bode well for anyone involved naturally.  With tongue planted firmly in cheek, Piranha 3-D won't leave you hanging.  Though a number of the CGI effects are quite fake looking, the makeup effects by the greats at KNB are spectacularly grisly, and the fact that Shue manages to keep a straight face throughout the proceedings as well is worth nothing.

This is the most fun I've had watching a movie in a really, really long time.  Definately not a kids movie!!  If there isn't blood on screen there are boobs, 80% of the movie has nudity so be warned.  If your looking for a high class oscar nominee this is not it at all.

Dead serious undertones continually bubble to the surface, but more on that later. Oh, and this movie is edumacational. For instance, did you know that earthquakes can lead to piranha infestations?? Well, that's not exactly the whole story. First, a human has to pollute a precious resource. Extra points when what you're defiling said lake with is a receptacle that leads to debauchery. Then, poof! Beer bottle hits bottom; temblor ensues or whatever. Regardless, another thing we discover is that the whirlpool effect doesn't hinder piranha, so remember that the next time you flush the toilet. Plus, you know that ""South Park"" episode where Jimbo Kern and his Auto-Tune-playing Vietnam buddy Ned Gerblansky catch their fish with dynamite? Well, that was just a cartoon, but it works here as well, although I don't know how tasty piranha serve up in the skillet. Anyway, those are just baby piranha, so let's swim along to the stuff that really holds water.

""Piranha"" is at its best when it makes its statement about how the American Dream has turned into a nightmare (boy was that clever!). Some people have said that French director Alexandre Aja -- whose big splash on the scene, the feminist ""High Tension,"" was admittedly a disaster, something I attribute to what must have been an abusive relationship at the time -- hates freedom fries and is just an anti-American plant from Sarkozyland. I disagree. I think it is very American to express yourself no matter what others might think. It's what our forefathers did. It's why we can bash our communist president without being called racist.

In this complex film, Aja is warning us against our current obsession with over-consumption, the pleasures of the flesh and contempt for nature. The blood and gore signifies our wayward souls. It's what Gustave Dore was doing in his ""Inferno"" woodcuts. It's why Aja takes it to such gut-wrenching extremes.

Still not convinced that this was the only movie you needed to see in 2010?

OK then, let's do a point-by-point comparison with Steven Spielberg's far-inferior ""Jaws"":

* ""Piranha"" has much more nudity. It's mostly ta-tas, but if you're into it, there is a crucial scene involving male anatomy.

* In ""Jaws,"" the shark was a chintzy mechanical puppet. In ""Piranha,"" the fish actually look real.

* In ""Piranha,"" there's none of that namby-pamby hubbub about closing down the beach that drags on for like 20 minutes in ""Jaws."" Hence, less boredom and more corpses!

* In ""Piranha,"" Richard Dreyfuss' character dies in the first scene.",1292803200,2,2705,5.008908685968819

Death by piranhas
That definitely is the
worst way to go yet

What a way to end the summer.

After two good movies (Inception and The Expendables) and long laundry list of disappointments (Salt, The Last Airbender), Piranha ends the summer movie season on a 3D bang. It is the film you kinda wish you didn't love after seeing as it's exaggerated to the extreme and generic as hell, but you still love it since it managed to be entertaining as all hell.

The 3D is indeed post converted (*dramatic music*) but fear not, for a post conversion it's actually really good. Unlike Alice In Wonderland where the screen got all blurry in the action-packed scenes, and the Last Airbender, a distorted-picture film that required you wear a pair of tinted glasses to ""un-blur"" the image. Actually I won't lie, this is the best conversion I've ever seen. A lot of the ""pop out"" effects work (the puke on the boat, the taser in the beginning) and the image doesn't look flat.

The plot is quite straightforward- a young teen disobeys his mother's rules to watch over his young sister and her friend, and goes off with a young girl and a porn site owner on a boat, to film some porn. However, a prehistoric breed of Piranha awakens and takes over the lake, with very gory results. Of course, nothing Oscar worthy, but that's the point.

This film is one bad film- way too over the top, horrible acting, plot holes galore- but it's so hilarious and well aware of it, and it became fun to watch for that reason. It's provided some of the most entertainment of any film this year. And in 3D, to add a nice campy touch too. Overall it's a very fun film, and worth seeing it. Just realize it's a B flick nothing more, and it was meant to be awful, and you will have fun!",1285632000,,1766,4.421538461538462

Piranha doesn't disappoint! And how could it? What expectations could you possibly have of it, that couldn't be satisfied? If you have any such expectations - they are unreasonably high. I'll point out again, that it's called Piranha, okay?

Based on Piranha's poster (which proudly displays a hot babe sunbathing on an inflatable raft, while a school of deadly piranha emerge from below), you go to see a movie like this for only two reasons: to see naked flesh and to see blood.

Surely the extras were instructed they need only bring one thing with them to the shoot, between the two sexes (both involving numbers; six packs and two pieces! While the film unfortunately yields away from so much as a single sex scene - there is plenty of naughty dancing, steamy make-out sessions, and full frontal nudity to go around!

Elizabeth Shue and Ving Rhames play their roles seriously from start to finish and before you can ask yourself why; Jerry O'Connell has you snickering at his over the top portrayal of a sleazy, coke-head `show me your boobs' TV show host. Way over the top, he plays it; so the combination of him over-acting and Shue and Rhames playing it straight, was amusing.

The plot is extremely simple but fun. It's spring break and after an earthquake, below a popular lake - thousands of starving flesh-eating piranha have emerged from a hidden secondary lake that was long ago lost to the access of man. Some two million years ago; as is explained to us by Christopher Lloyd's character - some sort of fish guy.

The task of `lead character' is shared between Elizabeth Shue who plays the town Sheriff and her son Jake (Steven R. McQueen). Mom has to keep idiots safe at the lake, so it's up to Jake to babysit his little bro and sis. But the scumbag O'Connell character has offered Jake a job as a location scout for his video - and there's gonna be a ton of hot girls there, so what is he to do? He pays the kids his babysitting score plus an extra 20 to keep quiet, while he tends to more personated matters.

The movie is absolutely absurd in everything in tries, but never stops being enjoyable, even for a second. A girl's hair is stuck in a boat propeller - thus ripping her face off; a sharp razor-wire on the loose, slashes through two girls, hitting their bikini straps just right and removing their tops before they fall over, cut in half; and there's even a shot of Elizabeth Shue screaming, ""Get the f**k out of the water!"" when no one is listening to her. Oh, and did I mention that in the 3D version (which I recommend) you get to have a girl puke all over you in 3D?

As fun as all that sounds, I must warn you that if needless and continuous female nudity, and explicit shots of girls shaking what they've got, for prolonged periods of time does not interest you - then you may have a problem here. You know how when you watch Burn Notice there are little snippets of girls walking on the beach in bikinis, placed in between scenes throughout each episode? Yeah, think of that - only multiply the amount of women and the time spent with them by 10 and you'll be somewhere close to what's found nestled between all the carnage and mayhem of Piranha.

And while on the subject of carnage and mayhem; there's also an overabundance of that as well. May want to watch what you eat before attending. Piranha is right up there with the Hostel and Saw franchise as far as gore goes - and it's all out in the open on a hot sun-shinny day, versus a dark and gritty torture chamber. So you get to see every little detail, and it wasn't done with crappo-CGI.

I have yet to see the original which was released in 1978 but will be checking it out soon. It couldn't have been that bad, because it sparked the attention of James Cameron enough, to motivate him to write and direct the sequel: Piranha Part II: The Spawning, released in 1981!

The 2010 version is directed by Alexandre Aja, who has also given us such disgusting gifts as High Tension, The Hills Have Eyes (2006), and Mirrors. Anyone who casts Eli Roth in their movie as `Wet T Shirt Host'; is all right in my book! Aja did a terrific job with this film as he did his others, and not much could have been done to make it any better. It was a blast!

That being said; I know some of you will never see this film, and others of you will be mortified and mad at me for recommending it. But just relax - I've told you what it contains and this is a total guy's movie, yes. No one is saying it isn't! But that's why studios have Eat Pray Love in theaters at the same time. So if he drags you to this - drag him to that!

This is not to imply that all women and only women will find this film offensive.",1284422400,2,5101,4.4326923076923075

4020683,3,B002ZG98L4,"Piranha 3D is a remake of the 1978 original film Piranha which was itself a parody of the classic film Jaws. The film was made by French producer Alexandre Aja best known for his remake of The Hills Have Eyes. You might be asking yourself: now why would Piranhas come out of seemingly nowhere and kill people? The storyline provides the answer: 1) There is a lake under a lake in which Piranhas have survived by eating their own kind in order to survive in this prehistoric lake and when an earthquake hits the Piranhas break loose 2) This is a ""horror"" movie (I'd say it's more of a horror-comedy), it doesn't have to actually make sense in order to enjoy. This is a remake of a movie that was really a parody of Jaws, let's put it that way.

I'd say a fun aspect of the film is how it's not that well-written but it makes for a fun B movie. One advantage the movie has is acting, except some characters that were rather goofy the acting in Piranha 3D is pretty good considering how this is a horror movie. The main characters especially were portrayed by good actors in which we actually do see a development to the point that we do care if they survive. The humor of the movie is similar to that of teen aimed movies such as American Pie and Sex Drive, not necessarily a bad thing unless you would consider that sort of humor juvenile. For instance about the humor, watching a penis eaten by piranhas with the 3D effect can only be funny or tasteless, you decide! Now the 3D effect worked very well to a certain degree I'm not sure how well it worked because I have not seen much 3D movies as of yet. Yet there were some pretty good effects and some good thrills resulted out of it. The Piranhas looked amazing and the death scenes (of which there are many) were done in an excellent gory way and looked like an actual death suffered due to Piranhas, it was convincing and not over-exaggerated like you might think it would be. A low point would be the ending as it's a big thrill but ends perhaps too suddenly and surprisingly (maybe a Piranha 3D 3 is in the works? Yes Dimension Films has announced that due to the success earned on the opening weekend by grossing over 10 millions there will be a sequel).

Was I disappointed with Piranha? Not really as I knew what to expect (even though some things were unexpected) and knew what kind of movie I was going into. Should you expect high quality from this movie? The answer is no but you should expect to have some fun watching it, especially with friends. Who would I recommend Piranha 3D to? To those who are looking for a fun mindless movie on a boring night, it's entertaining to say the least. One thing is sure if you think the movie misses the target it achieved (whatever it is) it misses in an amusing way. 3 stars out of 5, flawed but fun in the way that you enjoy a good B movie.",1283040000,28,2845,4.29608938547486
4020684,4,B002ZG98L4,"*** first, it was nice seeing the always beautiful and talented Elisabeth Sue on the big-screen (and in 3D).  She has made some good movies over the years (""Leaving Las Vegas"" comes to mind, also ""Hollow Man"").

this is a re-make of the Roger Corman classic of the same name.  Only this time, we get the 3D treatment.  Jerry O'Connell is truly funny and entertaining as a ""Girls Gone Wild""-type of director.  He is filming the party atmosphere during Spring Break taking place on a lake in Arizona.  There are thousands of young college party-goers.

But there's a problem.  A seismic shift at the bottom of the lake has opened a channel from another closed off section of the lake, releasing thousands of pre-historic piranhas.  They are very hungry.  Elizabeth Sue, plays the part of the sheriff.  Once all hell breaks loose, she has to try to keep everyone safe, as the deadly fish eventually swim and make their way to the party-goers.

  Piranha 3D though is surprisingly well made and fun despite not being too scary. It's a bit slow but once it gets going, it's both hilarious and very gruesome. So many people get ripped apart after awhile that it's impossible to keep up with the kill count.

4020687,4,B002ZG98L4,"(Note the title is a joke)

I saw this in theater, thinking this was going to be a B rated horror movie at best. Yes it had some very good actors (Richard Dryfus, Ving Rhames, Jerry O'Connel and Christopher Loyd) making appearances with the 3d being corny. Man was I wrong. It seemed the creators took a look at almost every movie with a simular plot, deadly creatures loose with horny, naked college students falling prey. Then took the good things and maybe a few bad and mixed them together.

This movie works. Unlike most movies like this, the first half of the movie doesnt get to the gore right away (there are some scenes though), they focus on plot and character development. So if something happens to a character we either are sadened or happy if they have a problem. We also know more of what is going on.

Now for the gore, its simple. Its very very very very very gory. I mean what would you expect in a R rated film about Prehistoric Piranhas getting loose on a lake during spring break. I mean have you ever seen what a pack a normal Piranhas do when there is meat in the water, they could eat it up in seconds, so imagine it being people.

The 3D was done very well, they really did a good job using the espect whether it was a propeller, Piranhas flying or bits of human flesh and blood.

Now the only problem I saw with the movie was the ending. Its half a scene. Just when it gets exciting it ends. No Im serious. Without spoiling it, it was like this (below is not part of the movie)

""The group finally escaped the house and when they do, they are shocked at what they are looking at. The camera pans to what they are looking and its.... the end.""

Another words, they create a new plot twist then end without knowing whats next.

The movie could have really gone great if they had continued with what happened at the end. Great movie.",1282780800,,1856,4.282857142857143
4020688,3,B002ZG98L4,"The Review:

Piranha 3D is a new film by Alexandre Aja, maker of the 2006 remake of the The Hills Have Eyes.  Piranha 3D is unbelievably crude, gory and certainly not the best written film, but you know what?  It's also a lot of fun.  It's probably a better B movie than Quentin Tarantino's and Robert Rodriguez's Grind House  (Death Proof and Planet Terror) of a few years ago.

Piranha 3D takes place over spring break in a picturesque lake town (the film was shot entirely on location in Lake Havisu).  Inexplicably an underwater earth quake tears open a rift beneath the lake, revealing a deeper underwater lake (yes, that's probably redundant), which is home to prehistoric piranhas that have survived for millions of years.  This setup is appropriately preposterous and we the viewers know the type of movie we're in for when the effect of the underwater quake creates a funnel that looks suspiciously like a toilet flushing.  It's a super campy opening sequence that sets the tone for the rest of the film.  What passes for the plot is hardly worth summarizing.  Suffice it to say this unfortunate infestation by prehistoric pygocentrus nattereri is occurring when thousands of kids descend on the town for spring break.  What follows is a series of gory dismemberments and naked frolics--in 3D!

Piranha 3D is a self aware send-up of the gore fests of the 70s and 80s like Jaws and the original Piranha.  The stars are clearly having a lot fun with it, especially Jerry O'Connell as soft core porn producer, Derrick Jones, a send up of Girls Gone Wild impresario, Robert Francis, which is a nice segue way into the fact that this movie is a hard R.  The fact that this wasn't NC-17 demonstrates the utter ridiculousness of the movie ratings system.  Free Willy, this is not.  There's as much T&A and probably more frontal nudity than one might see in Girls Gone Wild (alas I've never had the pleasure of seeing any of Mr. Francis' direct to DVD masterpieces).  There's an underwater naked ballet featuring Kelly Brook and Riley Steele that goes on for damn near 5 minutes.  It's awkward, but hilarious because of it, especially when you realize that they've been underwater long enough to have drowned halfway through the sequence.

Then there is the gore.  ""Over the top"" does not even begin to describe it.  Unlike movies like Hostel, which have been described as torture porn, Piranha 3D is so gory and self aware that its portrayal of aquatic violence is comedic.  When I saw this movie opening night the audience laughed a lot in a good way.  The 3D effects merely accentuated the film's crude humor and its ubiquitous gore.  One of the members of the cast meets a particularly ignoble end in what is probably a 3D first, which I won't spoil for you here.

All in all, Piranha 3D is a rousing success at recreating a B-movie.  The 3D is surprisingly well done and greatly adds to the over the top feel of the film.  This is, however, not great cinema, but that's not the point.  See this movie with people that appreciate schlocky horror movies and who have a good sense of humor.  Don't see it with your parents and for heaven's sake don't take little children to see it.  It is offensive, and it is crude and it is a lot of fun when viewed for what it is, which is a campy send up of the genre.

This is a fun (funny at times, as intentioned), fast-paced ride that keeps you on the edge of your seat and your heart racing, as well. This is a great remake that is faithful to its original without taking away its spirit. Alexandre Aja has got another remake hit on his hands. This is one of the best horror movies in years and one of the best horror remakes in years.",1282435200,4,4569,4.969934640522876

8384849,4,B002ZG98L4,"Not quite a remake, this version of the classic film Piranha only has one thing in common with the originalthe title.  Otherwise, this is just another wild raunchy romp that relies too much on sleaze and base humor to get by.  The plot is simplistic: spring break happens at the same time as a seismic event occurs, releasing a ton of prehistoric piranha into the lake they're frolicking in.  This movie made enough money to support a sequel that did not fair as well.

If you're expecting more than killer fish, plenty of gore, and bare breasts, you will be greatly disappointed.  This is not the Citizen Kane of piranha films.",1514592000,,628,4.621621621621622
8384850,4,B002ZG98L4,"Every year the population Lake Victoria explodes from 5,000 to 50,000 for Spring Break, a riot of sun and drunken fun. this year, there's something more to worry about than hangovers and complaints from local old timers; a new type of terror is about to be cut loose on Lake Victoria. After a sudden underwater tremor sets free scores of the prehistoric man-eating fish and boy do they look cool, we get the usual amount of dead teens and dumb party-ers. Of course there are the usual cast of characters who are the ""center"" of the movie (BTW, I love Jerry O'Connell, but he was annoying in this) and of course the usual chum in the water, too. With our intrepid band of heroes? you have the ones I refer to as the Red Shirt types that you know are doomed. Overall it is some fun and whoever told Elizabeth Shue that she could act? They were so wrong and she has tried to do many things, all with her customary bad acting. Oh and the 2 little annoying getting into trouble kids esp the smart mouth girl. I so wanted them to get eaten.",1514592000,,1034,4.3076923076923075
