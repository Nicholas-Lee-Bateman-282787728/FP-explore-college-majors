The song selection is of course remarkable, and he can still shine, as on Let it Be, for example.

Richard had no idea of which cameras to use for concert filming (compare this to The Band ""The Last Waltz""), coupled with the fact no one bothered to remaster the video and audio soundtrack on this DVD.
But it was a good lesson for McCartney to learn, cause most of his other concerts after this were recorded in a much better fashion.

444614,3,6302262380,"Get Back is the filmed record of Paul's '89/'90 comeback tour and began a tradition of annoying concert films that continues through to today. This one was directed by Richard Lester, who made his name directing the Beatles' first two films and his eccentric style comes out in the concert film. We all know that these films are cut together from dozens of different shows, but unlike most others, Lester makes no attempt to disguise the fact. While it's a refreshingly honest approach, it can be irritating if not downright creepy to see Paul and band change clothes in the middle of a song. And while it's perfectly legitimate to illustrate The Long and Winding Road with news footage of the Beatles and the space race juxtaposed with vision of the Vietnam war, showing it all at full screen for the entire song is not what we paid to see.

The concert itself is magnificent with heaps of Beatles songs that until then had never been performed live. But as with all the concert films that came after it, the film does not do justice to the show. Being shot on film makes it look more dated than it really is, and the cutaways to the audience become so constant that you sometimes feel like you're watching an audience film occasionally interrupted by a concert. The fact that the same mistake of overusing audience shots has been made by three very different directors over 15 years can only suggest that the order came from higher up the chain. Paul, we know you're famous, that's why we want to see YOU!

Get Back, like just about everything that came after it until Good Evening New York City, merely teases us with a taste of what might have been.

Highlight: The first live version of Hey Jude, closely followed by the Abbey Road medley

444616,4,6302262380,"***vhs review***
 This is a very good rock video with solid presentations by Paul McCartney and his band. Footage is off several stops along the way on his big World Tour around 1990.

Paul and his group perform many of the old Beatles songs, along with his solo efforts after the famous band had broken up. The lighting in here was outstanding. I couldn't help wondering how much Paul paid just to put on these concerts. He even added fireworks to one of the numbers!

Like all good performers, McCartney has an excellent band backing him up, particularly a guitarist whose name I don't know but the guy looked like actor James Caan. Paul's wife Linda also was in the band. I didn't see her do much but it's sad to see her now knowing she died at such a young age.

For me, the finale was the best on the tape with the title song ""Get Back,"" along with songs off the ""Abbey Road,"" album, all of which were some of my favorite Beatles tunes.

Earlier in the concert, you see old film clips of the Beatles accompanying some of the songs, and that was nice to see. As with most concert tapes of any length, you'll get a few numbers you can skip but whatever your tastes, you'll get more than enough good rock 'n roll here.",1234569600,,1220,4.310043668122271
444617,3,6302262380,"This Macca tour was huge and great, but this DVD edition lacks of quality. Image is really granny as if they just copied from an old VHS tape. The sound is not 5.1
The addins made by Richard Lester could have been put as a special feature, but not in the middle of songs!
Said that, it is fair to say that the performance of Paul and the band is flawless.",1221782400,7,355,4.014084507042254
444618,5,6302262380,This is a great piece of work.  Very enjoyable to watch/listen to.  If you are a McCartney fan you must add this to your collection.,1198627200,,132,4.24
444619,5,6302262380,"McCartney regreso a las giras y conciertos en el ao de 1989 despues de 13 aos de ausencia. En aquel lapso de tiempo, pasaron importantes acontecimientos en la vida del segundo beatle. Habia estado 7 dias en la carcel en Japon por encontrarsele marihuana en la maleta, llevandose el susto de su vida de casi pasar aos en prision. Brujerias de madam Yoko decian por ahi. Su compinche John moria asesinado por el FBI y con el la esperanza de una reunion de los Beatles. Los Wings, al fin se disolvian. Un Paul mas maduro y con un disco en promocion, Flowers In The Dirt, se lanzaba a esta magica y misteriosa aventura. Paul realizo una estupenda gira mundial, su voz era aun fresca y no sonaba cansada como en sus ultimos conciertos del 2002 y 2006. Es obvio, esta mucho mas joven. Y es ahi en donde este DVD gana importancia. Es una mirada al Paul que hace cantar multitudes, aquel que demuestra su carisma y no le importa salir a escena al lado de su mujer, la recordada Linda. Paul registro en esta gira una de sus presentaciones mas celebradas, la de Rio de Janeiro, por alcanzar el record Guiness, con 184,368 personas.

22 temas en vivo presenta este DVD, lanzado en aquel tiempo como un Disco Laser. Ahora en formato DVD, este film es dirigido por Richard Lester, el mismo que dirigio las 2 primeras peliculas de los Fab Four. El error de Lester es mostrarnos un collage de imagenes de Paul en la epoca de los Beatles y Wings, mezcladas con las reacciones del publico. A quien le interesa el publico? Si lloran, rien, cantan, entran en ataque de histeria. Lo que importa es el performance de Paul y su banda. Pese a ese pequeo detalle, el disco suena y luce bien.",1189296000,,1667,4.447712418300654
444620,5,6302262380,"Wow!!!! I looooove this DVD (originally released in laser disc), amazing world tour. I think one of the best features in this dvd is the historical footage and videos. The setlist is absolutely great!",1170374400,2,200,4.911764705882353
444621,5,6302262380,"Wow, I have never seen such an energetic concert before. Everyone's having fun out there, and all his band mates are perfect in what they do. It's a shame he didn't reunite with them. They only problem is that they put footage of different arenas in one song. Like in Get Back, you first see Linda with this casual collared red shirt, and then it changes to this light blue jacket. Same goes with the drummer and Hamish. But the performance out-weighs that fault. This concert is like a dream Paul McCartney concert. I mean, Back in the US and Red Square was good, but the musicians weren't as talented as his old band. And back then Paul was younger, thus he had a lot more energy. I recommend this to any Beatles, Paul McCartney, or classic rock fan. This is a great concert film, maybe the best.",1158364800,14,798,4.398648648648648

444664,3,6302262380,"My favorite moments of the show were those that were objected to by another reviewer.  Just goes to show that we all see things differently.  I liked the news footage.  It brought back memories.  I liked seeing the girls scream for the Beatles, as they did back in 1964.  It was a great connection to my teenage years.  And I liked seeing the Vietnam footage.  I found it emotional, bringing back a very emotional time.

I've heard almost all of the songs a thousand times, so they are tired for me.  He had good energy on Live and Let Die, which also featured some news footage that I found strong.  But the classics, Let It Be and Hey Jude, are really exhausted for me.  If you haven't heard each of them a thousand times yet, you may still feel the power in those songs.  They used to be everyone's favorites.  These days I like a rocker like Can't Buy Me Love more, for its energy.  Paul almost apologizes for singing it, saying he was told it's a great song to shake your thing to, but it really is a good rock and roll song.

They never did have their reunion, and they never will, not here on Earth.  I like the message in the Commodores song Nightshift, and that's the only place we will ever see a Beatles reunion now.",1138492800,3,1227,4.269565217391304
444665,3,6302262380,"Before you start jumping on me for giving anything related to Paul a low rating, please read what I have to say.  I thought that since they waited so long to release this, it might be because they wanted to do a better job than they did on the Paul Is Live DVD.  That DVD has no 5.1, either Dolby or DTS, and the sound output is anemic.  So, I ordered this one, certain that it would be so much better.  No dice.  Again, no 5.1, no DTS, and anemic output, even worse than Paul Is Live.  The things I didn't like about it first time around on VHS (editing, continuity)I still don't like.

So, I'll wait for somebody to something right with a vintage Paul McCartney concert.  I would love to see Unplugged, never released on video, done right in 5.1 DTS.  That would be a show!!!",1136764800,5,777,4.195945945945946
444666,4,6302262380,"You can't go wrong with any of Paul McCartney's live recordings. Despite what anyone says about Sir Paul's post-Beatles music, when it comes to live performance, the man always gives 100 percent. He's as hard-working a showman as anyone in rock and always holds his own against virtually every live band. The guy cares about what he does, has a great voice, is a solid innovative bassist and one heck of a pianist. I am certain that almost everyone who attended the 1989 live shows filmed for this DVD ranks it as a night they will never forget.

I wish this DVD were longer, because it focuses almost exclusively on Paul's Beatles hits. I know that many people love hearing McCartney sing the Beatles Greatest Hits, but I'd like to hear more of his solo and Wings material. (In concert at the time, McCartney did include a lot of post-1970 material, but little of it is here save for the beautiful 'Put it There,' 'Live and Let Die,' and 'Coming Up.')

My major problem with the DVD comes from Richard Lester's decision to intercut newsfootage throughout many of the songs. 'The Long and Winding Road' is all but ruined by Vietnam imagery, for example, and by the time I reached the end of the DVD I was uncomfortably reminded of the movie version of 'Beatlemania' which used similar tricks. McCartney is the real deal and doesn't need such trickery. And, yes, that's the same Richard Lester who used to direct great popcorn flicks like 'Superman II' and 'The Three Musketeers' not to mention the Beatles own 'Hard Day's Night.' I've no idea why McCartney allowed Lester to ruin sections of this film with his heavy-handed social commentary.

I'm still giving this 4 stars if only because we get the joy of Paul McCartney rediscovering himself in front of a worldwide audience.",1129507200,36,1778,4.710610932475884
444667,5,6302262380,"Pretty much all of Paul McCartney's concert tours sicne his triumphant return to the stage in 1989 have had a concert movie or tv special made in conjunction with them (1993's ""Paul Is Live"", 2002's ""Back In The U.S."", 2005's ""Live In Red Square"" and 2006's ""The Space Within Us""), and while all of them are excellent, energetic undeniable proof of Paul's amazing showmanship, none of them have come close to matching the passion, vigor and energy present in 1991's ""Get Back"" (culled from Paul's 1989-1990 return to the stage).

The 22 songs performed are on here a solid mix of Beatles classics (""Got To Get You Into My Life"", ""The Long And Winding Road"", ""Let It Be"", ""Hey Jude""), solo hits (the only full uninterrupted from start to finish live performance of ""Band On The Run"", ""Live And Let Die""), and then new recordings from his 1989 album ""Flowers In The Dirt"" (""Rough Ride"", ""Put It There"", ""This One"").

With his youthful vigor as well as eternally boyish charm and good looks, Paul makes these oldise sound new again, and it also enables the (then) newer tracks to hold their own solid ground against the classics everyone knows.

A lot of people complain about the various news images and whatnot being present during many songs, but I love them. They're nostalgic and often moving, especially the moment during ""Fool On The Hill"" when Martin Luther King, Jr.'s ""I Have A Dream"" speech is played during the instrumental break, nearly driving my tears whenver I watch it or listen to it on cd.

If there's any complaints I have about this dvd, is that there are some great songs perfromed on this tour that could've been included, such as ""Jet"", ""Ebony & Ivory"", ""Maybe I'm Amazed"", ""Things We Said Today"" and ""My Brace Face"", all of which brought down the house as much as any of the numbers on this tape. No worries though, as all of these tracks are available on Paul's magnificent two disc live album from this tour, ""Tripping The Live Fantastic"".

Overall, ""Get Back"" is an excellent representation of McCartney, and is one of the finest concert movies ever made.",1126656000,5,2080,4.7032967032967035
444668,5,6302262380,"I bought the VHS version a couple of years ago, now that I got the DVD version I think it is better in video and sound quality than the tape, but either way, it is an excellent concert video that shows how the good music is. Of course there are songs mising (Silly love songs, let'hem in and so on) but the included ones are enough to get you rocking and singing. I like specially the way ""Can't buy me love"" ends and ""Coming Up"" (complete lenght version) starts with a terrific drumer intro, This DVD is by far worth the price.

444669,5,6302262380,"McCartney is a great showman and musician and this DVD perfectly illustrates my point. A McCartney show is a healthy blend of material from the Beatles, Wings and his ever growing solo cannon of albums. This 1989 tour, Paul's first in over a 10 year period, was a reintroduction of sorts to his live prowess. The performances and production are first rate as is his band and his own playing. The one ingredient missing is the high register of his once mighty vocal ability. Amazingly his last tour for Driving Rain found his abilities fully restored. Perhaps he is taking better care of his pipes these days. For whatever the case may be, it's good to have Paul these days performing new live versions of his classic catalog. With the release of this Get Back DVD it is now possible to have documents of his major tours on home video, except for ONE. Yes, the highly entertaining ROCK SHOW must now be considered for release! Rock Show is a concert film from the legendary Wings Over America tour from 1976 and it is long overdue for the DVD treatment.",1106092800,19,1052,4.571428571428571
444670,4,6302262380,"I had thrid row center for this concert and enjoyed every second. The concert footage is expertly shot by Beatle director Dick Lester. The sound sounds like it is coming from the stage monitors which is refreshing. Our Paul's voice sounds pretty rough. Somehow he got a stonger throat in the 2000s.

However, there are problems. The montage footage really comes from left field. The Beatle images are random and not edited in time to the song. And do we realy need images of napalmed children during ""The Long and Winding Road?"" There may have been better ways to break up the songs, like some Lester/Hard Days Night-type antics. Makes me miss Linda (and John and George).",1093392000,5,672,4.743589743589744

If you love The Beatles and Paul, this dvd is a must have object! I did deduct one star in my rating of this dvd, due to the unfortunate fact that the speed of the whole video seems to be about a half pitch too slow. And running the credits over the GOLDEN SLUMBERS medley is a shame. But it still is a remarkable concert film. Among the highlights are terrific versions of Beatles' songs like BACK IN THE USSR, HEY JUDE, YESTERDAY, SGT. PEPPER, THE FOOL ON THE HILL, HEY JUDE, I SAW HER STANDING THERE and GOLDEN SLUMBERS/CARRY THAT WEIGHT/THE END to mention a few. He also dips into his solo/Wings catalog with concert favorites such as BAND ON THE RUN, JET, MAYBE I'M AMAZED, COMING UP and many more. The band is tight, and there are tears of joy that just might come off your TV screen and get you tearing up as well.

I also highly recommend the 2 CD set TRIPPING THE LIVE FANTASTIC, which is a live album recorded on this same tour.

I challenge any serious Beatles fan to see and hear the GOLDEN SLUMBERS nedley without shedding a tear or two, accompanied by a few goosebumps.",1482969600,3,1227,4.307359307359308
