It reflects a time period in Spain where they were finally free to display a different side of art and ideologies... things that were repressed from the Franco time period. It goes against the stereotypes of the catholic church... just watch it.",1355270400,,272,4.934782608695652

An LSD addicted nun, another is a lesbian, and a drug dealer of dubious character seeks refuge in a convent. Must watch it.
