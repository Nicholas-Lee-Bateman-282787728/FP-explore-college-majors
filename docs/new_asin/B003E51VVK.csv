8395271,5,B003E51VVK,"Lately funimation/Geneon has been screwing us customers with there 13 episode releases for like d.grayman, and for geneon they released season 1,and 2 but not 3. What I heard was that they move to the eastern side away from funimation, they need to released season 3 kyo karas maoh and the ovas on dvd. So what I'm saying will the directors released all 1-201 episode on dvd, other than that Gintama is a excellent series even without the english dubbed. But if you did had the dubbed the series would be selling at sonic the hedgehog speed know joke, and also that if you guranteed that all of gintama episode would be released, section 23 you would have to restock over and over again.",1294704000,4,687,4.548387096774194
