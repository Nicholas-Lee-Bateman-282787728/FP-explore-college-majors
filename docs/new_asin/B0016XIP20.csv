8264226,5,B0016XIP20,"An awesome set of Video and Audio Complete Library. All of Srila Prabhupada collection. Great for Krishna Conscious students and devotees.

Perfect your life by association with a pure devotee of Krishna!
Srila Prabhupada is living in these DVDs and we can benefit immensely from his association in this transcendental form. ""By association with pure devotees, dirty things within the heart are gradually washed away by the grace of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Krishna.""

You can enjoy a completely new series of 6 DVDs called ""Prabhupada Darshan."" This is a chronological collection of all the silent footage of Srila Prabhupada edited together by Yadubara Prabhu of ISKCON Cinema. Yadubara worked on this project for more than ten years. The video is accompanied by three separate Prabhupada sound tracks you can choose from. It is in total about 25 hours with more than 15 hours of this video being released for the first time ever!

Them main soundtrack on ""Prabhupada Darshan"" is live audio when available with Prabhupada classes from the same time the footage was shot and bhajans and kirtans. The second sound track is Prabhupada conversations and morning walks from the same time and the third sound track is Prabhupada bhajans and purports.

There are completely new shows like a newly discovered documentary of Srila Prabhupada in Germany. It is a full-color, high quality 16mm film. It shows Prabhupada performing an initiation ceremony at the German temple, Schloss Rettershof.

The ""Prabhupada in Australia"" DVD is completely new. It contains hours of never-released before footage and completely new shows including the installation of Mahaprabhu in Melbourne, Prabhupada's visit to the Franciscan Seminary, the eventful college preaching engagement at Latrobe University, peaceful morning walks, hall programs, and of course the Ratha Yatra Festival and the after party. This is a complete new DVD with over 4 hours of Prabhupada nectar!!

The ""Festivals With Prabhupada"" DVD is so much improved. Now the Vyasa-Puja Festival in New Vrindavana and the Ratha Yatra Festival in Philadelphia have new color footage included which gives a whole new dimension to the experience of watching these programs.

All the black and white footage has been dramatically improved. It has all been digitally stabilized, the contrast has been corrected and the clarity of the images is so much better due to a new digital transfer of the original video tapes.

This is the final edition. There will not be another after this. It is the culmination of many years of work by both Nrsimhananda Prabhu at ITV and Yadubara Prabhu at ISKCON Cinema to preserve and distribute all the recorded film and video of Srila Prabhupada.

The Prabhupada DVD library is professionally produced on 19 duel-layer DVDs, improving the quality while reducing the cost. These DVDs will play on any DVD player, anywhere in the world.

The Prabhupada DVD set has subtitles in twenty languages and the new option of Russian and Italian voiceovers.
