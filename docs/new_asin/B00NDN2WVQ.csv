8677542,1,B00NDN2WVQ,"I hate nose rings, especially on an ugly face. I also dislike focusing  only on face, everything else being blurred. Watched for 5-10 minutes, including the depressing scene of sexual intercourse, and the girl slapping her face repeatedly. More a fartsy than an artsy movie",1482019200,2,273,5.066666666666666
8677543,4,B00NDN2WVQ,"Maria (Lucia Uribe) is 18 and achingly lonely, and she has a hand in that. She confides in no one and has indiscriminate sex with many. It's the only tool she utilizes to connect, but these exchanges, in which she is a dispassionate, detached participant only serve to exacerbate her sense of separateness.  She slaps herself in the face following one such episode. She communicates with herself via letters in her journal, alternately praising, promising a shinier future, and sometimes mildly scolding. On her last day of high school, she takes off without a word, crossing Mexico by bus in search of something-- likely herself.  As she departs the noisy chaotic glare of Mexico City, she, over time,  draws closer to Nature and a level of peace; actually lingering in La Paz.  She has a lovely, sweet encounter with Juan (Roberto Mares), but  again vanishes in silence. I won't reveal more. This is a sensitive, slow-paced, but not boring, beautifully photographed (Ivan Hernandez) piece. Many long closeups ask us to engage with Maria in the same way she does, in silence. We can see the introspection and self-reflection in her face.  The many sea and landscapes are glorious. The only bit of curious and almost spoofy cinematography occurs at the end (you'll see). The writer/director of this gentle, moody, atmospheric film is Gabriel Marino. Mares' work is winning.  Uribe's acting is exceptional!  Recommend.",1480896000,2,1417,5.051502145922747
