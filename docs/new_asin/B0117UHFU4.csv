7329280,1,B0117UHFU4,"Extremely disappointed in Amazon.  This is classical price rigging at its finest, and since they have exclusivity rights, there's literally no reason to think this absurd price will change anytime soon.

So, congratulations Amazon.  This deal, which I assume you paid A LOT of money for, has pretty much cost you more sales than you could have imagined.  If these reviews, comments, complaints, and rants on various different sites are anything to go by.  I can just pray that Marvel and ABC have learned their lesson for the third season to NOT try this again.

Until then, import it is.",1442534400,110,588,4.83

7329283,5,B0117UHFU4,"****************** UPDATE: Sept 22.
Back down to $54.99 as of this morning, Better but still should be in the $40s.
****************** UPDATE: Sept 19.
While I am glad I pre-ordered this at $54.99, I was hoping that with the low price guarantee that the price would go down, not up...way up. Amazon should be ashamed gouging their customers at $71.99 on the day of release. However, that will not lower my star rating for the series itself, as those 5 stars were earned. Amazon, however, gets 0 stars for extreme price fixing on this ""exclusive.""
****************** ORIGINAL REVIEW
Season 2 definitely takes off where Season 1 ended, with S.H.I.E.L.D. (Strategic Homeland Intervention, Enforcement, and Logistics Division) having collapsed due to extensive infiltration by Hydra. The principal cast, consisting of Clark Gregg (Phil Coulsen), Ming-Na Wen (Melinda May), Brett Dalton Grant Ward), Chloe Bennet (Skye), Iain De Caestecker (Leo Fitz), and Elizabeth Henstridge (Jenna Simmons) are joined by Nick Blood (Lance Hunter) and Adrianne Palicki (Bobbi Morse) and all turn in excellent performances. There is a lot more action and suspense in year two with various sub-plots occurring to keep you on your toes. The very much improved special effects simply adds to the overall value. One of the aspects that makes the Marvel Cinematic Universe so great happens to be the wealth of characters and being able to draw on them. Appearances by Lady Sif (Jaimie Alexander), Timothy ""Dum Dum"" Dugan (Neal McDonough), Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell) and Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders), to name a few, along with interweaving story arcs from the movies adds a great deal to the entertainment of the series. Then, let's just add some outstanding Edward James Olmos (as Robert Gonzales) into the mix and see where you peg him. If you followed Season 1 during the building stage of this intricate show then you really need to get Season 2. IMO this is a definite must have for Marvel Cinematic Universe fans. Pre-ordered and waiting. Highly recommended.",1439424000,21,2038,5.123123123123123
7329284,5,B0117UHFU4,Such a good show! Season 1 is mainly setting up everything for an unbelievable season 2.,1438905600,,88,4.5625
7329285,5,B0117UHFU4,"This show is fantastic. Granted, it did start off a bit slow in season one (often times felt like a procedural), but it offered great character development. However, after the midseason break, it came back firing on all cylinders! It really outdid itself during the Uprising arc. Season two was just as intense and thrilling, introducing us to new characters that upped the stakes for the six original agents. The plot is complex, but not overwhelming, and the action scenes are incredible, two stand-outs are May vs. May and Skye vs. HYDRA.

Agents of SHIELD has become a great show. It has you on the edge of your seat, and something is always happening. Even when you think all is calm- for example, five seconds before the end of the season finale, BAM, it just hits you.",1438646400,13,775,4.656934306569343
7329286,5,B0117UHFU4,This is a very Excellent show with great character development!  I enjoy watching it and always look forward to the next episode.  I can't wait for season 3.,1438128000,10,157,4.571428571428571

7329288,5,B0117UHFU4,"Agents of SHIELD starts very slowly in season 1, but it all pays off here in season 2. Each episode is packed with action and intrigue. The characters are well developed and their relationships are interesting. This season deals with the fallout and consequences of season 1 and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. This is a spy show. You honestly don't know who's on whose side until the very end. Special effects are a major improvement over season 1, some scenes towards the end especially look like they belong in a movie. 5 out of 5, highly recommended for any fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Crosses over with Avengers: Age of Ultron after episode 19 for those who want to know.",1438041600,21,691,4.672131147540983

I just wish that the powers that be would finally release the 3rd and 4th seasons.  I think the show is on season 5 or 6 now and season 2 was the last season released on a proper official release.

7329319,5,B0117UHFU4,"Just started watching the series, season 4, so it's been nice to catch up. Quality of DVD was excellent, however I missed the Play All feature in the main menu. I like to watch a full disk at one shot when I have the time. It was tedious to return to the main menu to get to the next episode.  It's difficult to offer a complete review without offering up more in spoilers than anyone would appreciate. I will say that this season was a little darker than the first one. The lighter moments were infrequent. Treachery and deceit are a heavy emphasis. However it's still a must watch season.  We're introduced to new characters: Hunter, Bobbi and Mack. Most important - we get answers to a lot of the questions raised in season 1: What happened to May in Bahrain? Who is her ex-husband? What is Skye's destiny? Who are her parents? What is Fitz's condition? What is Coulson writing on the wall? Enjoy!",1505433600,,900,4.448484848484848

The show is a little bit darker, and Skye's wisecracking and charming sense of humor is not as prevalent, but the storywriting is just as good, Grant really comes across as a Big Bad, and agents Hunter, Mac, May and Bobbi portray SHIELD agents at their best and as you would want them to be in real life.  Director Phil Coulson does his usual masterful job of crisis control, improvisation, and actually leading...proving his mettle during the SHIELD factional infighting.

Well, these morons make that as annoying as they could. There's no way for watching more than one episode in a sitting without going back to the top menu after showing the piracy screen and selecting the next one manually. Just about every other show (except many ABC Studios series) will let you do that.

And if you planned to start the beginning of an episode and come back later, well it won't remember where you left off, again unlike just about every other disc out there.

ABC Studios, you suck big-time. With that off my chest, I feel much better :-)",1461456000,3,703,4.484375

Agents of SHIELD is different from a lot of series in that it has some longer story arcs that play out across episodes and seasons.  It's fun to be able to binge-watch it and rewind, since you can catch the lead-ins for those story arcs on the 2nd watching.  The action is great.

7329497,2,B0117UHFU4,"We love the show.  But retailer exclusives should NEVER last this long, much less be seemingly indefinite.  I don't think I'm being unrealistic.  I know Disney TV BDs are closer to HBO in terms of price than most series from just about any other studio.  But, this felt like being gouged by Twilight Time, between the lack of extras, the higher than normal price premium (even the Black Friday sale, which didn't sell out btw, was MUCH pricier than the first season and other similar Disney series pricing, like Once Upon a Time) and the shoddy production standards (our factory sealed copy already had scratches on the discs).  We can't wait to see Season 3, but it'll likely be a while before we can justify the price, if amazon gets any more exclusives from Disney.  Or worse, Season 3 doesn't get a BD release at all, if Disney thinks demand doesn't justify it, based on poor sells of Season 2, which would only be due to such a limited, pricey release model.  We might continue the series on DVD, if we absolutely have to, but only after holding out for a belated BD release or the assurance one will never come.  If the rest of the series becomes digital only, sadly we'll have to stop with season 2, as we'll never support the blatant anti-consumer, manipulative release model that is streaming.",1457654400,2,1302,4.606060606060606

7329529,5,B0117UHFU4,"Life in the Marvel Universe is never easy.
It is fraught with danger from the weird and REALLY weird; its heroes and heroines are often conflicted and their lives are more akin to a roller coaster ride than a pleasant drive to grandma's house for Sunday dinner.
That pretty much sums up Season Two of ""Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" In this season the erstwhile men and women who are sworn to protect just about everyone must dodge government agents and the military - who are convinced they are terrorists - and do battle with villains ranging from the truly evil masters of HYDRA to ""InHumans"" with strange powers. Along the way they must also try to get along with each other, which isn't as easy as it sounds, and adjust to new team members.
Oh, and they must also forge alliances with people who have betrayed them in the past in order to accomplish their missions.
The result: Excellent television.
Season Two was enlivened by a host of top-tier guest stars including Edward James Olmos and Lucy Lawless as well as Maya Stojan, Kyle MacLachlan and Dichen Lachman. MacLachlan shone particularly bright as the erratic - and occasionally psychotic - father of Agent Skye. Alternately frightening and tender, he was a delight to watch as he went through a series of mood changes.
No plot spoilers here, but I will say that there are some wonderful - and completely unexpected - twists in the season-long narrative.
As always, the special effects are extremely well done, the acting top notch, and the scripts leavened with just the right amount of action and sly humor. The fight scenes - especially those featuring Chloe Bennett (who plays Skye), Ming-na Wen (as Agent Melinda May), and Adrianne Palicki (as Agent Barbara ""Bobbi"" Morse) - are spectacular. Marvel is famous for having strong female characters and ""Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" is no exception to that rule: In fact, it might be the only show on American television with an equal number of strong female and male characters.
At the risk of repeating myself, this is excellent television.",1455148800,,2052,4.849002849002849

7329534,3,B0117UHFU4,"The copies Amazon is now shipping have the ""play all"" feature, so that's why I broke down and bought it

As far as the season goes, it's okay.

Lots of poorly-motivated hand-to-hand (I didn't try to keep track, but I think everyone fought everyone else at least once!).  It's not a set of mixed-value short stories with a big finale like S1, it's really just one story:  Skye's.  There are some small sub-plots (Fitz's brain-damage aphasia seems to be clearing up astonishingly quickly), one of the nicer secondary protags (who should have had a bigger part and longer run) and one of the more enigmatically-psychopathic secondary antags get bumped off.  Ward does more psychopath-y things and escapes again.  His scenes again have some contradictions built in (like his failure to kill Buddy in S1) in hope that we'll wonder whether he's really a psychopath (which he is, but I predict a Star-Wars-type denouement in which he saves Skye and dies, as Anakin/Vader did by killing the Emperor, thus making his earlier betrayals and killings somehow not as bad).

I'm currently watching it for the third time, and it still seems to be rather ""even"" (aka flat) compared to S1.  Lots of dim lighting which is probably supposed to increase the suspense (something might jump out!), but doesn't really.  The meaning of the diagrams scratched into surfaces is revealed in an unmotivated and unbelievable way.  Et cetera.  I buy dvds that I'm going to watch more than just a few times, but I feel pretty sure I'll be watching S1 more often than S2.",1454803200,,1539,4.809885931558935

Skye also finds out that her father is alive. Except for the first episode in the second half of the season it was nice to see Hydra take a back seat for awhile.

7329604,4,B0117UHFU4,"+++Warning+++ This will contain spoilers from season 1, and hints, but no major giveaways from season 2.  If you have not seen season 1 and the prior Marvel movies proceed with caution.

The second season of the show was much improved over the first season.  It stood much more on its own this season than it did in season 1 where it was as much a filler between the various movies than it was telling its own story.  This season they really did it right.  Yes there were movie tie ins, Jamie Alexander appeared as Lady Sif in one of the episodes, and episode 19 was a direct lead in to Age of Ultron which came out later that week.  Aside from those, this season was really the story of the Inhumans and tied to Skye and her family.

The season picks up down the line from the HYDRA takeover of SHIELD at the end of season 1, and Captain America Winter Soldier.  While battling HYDRA the team is also evading the US Military and face a bunch of new enemies.  We also finally see Skye's family this season.  I cannot say too much about that plot without giving too much away, but it is a story that plays out throughout the season.  We also see some of the takedown of HYDRA by Agent Carter and the precursor to SHIELD, the SSR.  This of course was a tie in to the stand alone mini-series that aired during the winter hiatus for Agents of SHIELD.

Another large part of the season 2 story was the fallout of Ward's actions in season 2.  Much of it tied to Fitz and Simmons who did not come out unscathed from his dumping them in the ocean.  The cast becomes even more ensemble with additions of Adrianne Palicki as Bobbi Morse, Nick Blood as Lance Hunter, and Henry Simmons as Alphonso ""Mack"" MacKenzie, to the main cast.  This resulted in less screen time for everyone overall, and there were times where some of the characters did not appear much at all.  But it ultimately worked.  What will probably be the standout episode of the season was the the episode where we learn exactly why May is called ""The Cavalry"" and why she hates it.  Chloe Bennett also gets a change to improve her acting chops this season and she has many emotionally powerful scenes.

As for the set itself, yes it is way overpriced.  Especially since the amount of extras are minimal.  Just a short blooper reel and about 10 min of deleted scenes.  No commentary or behind the scenes materials.  It does look and sound great on Blu Ray, but because it is exclusive to Amazon they are jacking up the price.",1446940800,,2481,4.366812227074236
7329605,4,B0117UHFU4,I should give it five stars but the price and where's the 45 minutes of extras they was a few bloopers and that's it.  Agents of SHIELD is excellent show this packing of it is over priced.,1446681600,,188,4.081081081081081

7329620,5,B0117UHFU4,"The twists and turns definitely keep you guessing through this second season.  A real standout is Kyle MacLachlan as Sky's real father; he walks a tightrope line between psycho-scary and engaging, almost like an enormous, rabid puppy that just can't help being cute sometimes even when you know he's going to rip your throat out.  A monster, but a  sympathetic one.  The character of Sky has blossomed into a full-fledged agent, and she's believably bad-ass and vulnerable at the same time.  I absolutely love what the writers and the actor Iain De Caestecker have done with Fitz; a layered, heart-rending performance without every being pathetic, which could easily have happened.  Josh keeps you guessing at every turn of the story; I had no idea what to expect from Ward, let alone Hydra and most of the regulars.

7329627,2,B0117UHFU4,"My eight year old daughter and I really enjoyed season 1 together. This season I was disappointed and so was she. There is so much more violence and more graphic scenes that it ended up scaring my now, nine year old daughter. I was truly hoping we could enjoy this show as a family and was really taken aback by the dismembered body parts that they decided to include in this season. I mean there is enough violence in the real world for me. I would enjoy it better with a little less violence in this action adventure shows.(HINT AT GRAPHIC SCENES) SHOW LESS. If dealt with appropriately you still get a great show in the end and more fans as well. Kids love this genre so make it more friendly for them too! Don't get me wrong it still entertains but not in the way the first season did. Thoroughly aggravated at the changes they made. Directors and writers need to quit thinking everyone needs to see gore.

7329644,3,B0117UHFU4,"As with Marvel's Agent Carter, this rating is not a reflection of the show. Especially considering season two is immensely better than season one (although I do have a soft spot for season one, despite its flaws). However, the same problems Agent Carter's Blu ray has are magnified here. Only two special features, and nothing else. But the annoying thing? The same lack of a Play All function that Agent Carter has is worse here. At least with Agent Carter, it's just eight episodes. But having to select each individual episode to play is a pain. What happened to the wonderful Season Play feature from Season One? Heck, they even made teasers at the end of each disc. Who thought that it would be a good idea to drop it for this release? Not to mention the increase in price. Around $72, seriously? I think it may have gone down since I bought it, but still. The only reason I went ahead and got it was the fact it was a gift.

Only get this if you know you're going to rewatch it regularly, or live in an area where internet isn't reliable. Otherwise, you get a far better viewing experience on Netflix or Hulu (yes, even on the plan with commercials).

Update: Feb 20, 2016: At around $37, this is far easier to recommend buying now.",1445212800,2,1238,4.4493392070484585

The show itself is amazing but this review is for the presentation. I'm completely okay with it being an exclusive and my shipping ended up okay with no damage. It looks nice on the shelf and that's about all I have to say positive about it. The lack of special features was extremely disappointing. There's a blooper reel and a few deleted/extended scenes. No interviews, commentary, behind-the-scenes, development notes, nothing. Also a little put out on the effort put into the slipcover. Season 1 had a nice matte finish with a stamped logo, and this was just an ordinary slipcover, nothing special about it. If I'm going to shell out $60 for a TV show, I expect something for it.

Is it worth it?  The show itself is a great show, it really picks up in the second season with SHIELD fighting Hydra after the it's infiltration into the organization.  The second part of the season deal s with the fallout of such as well the plot line of dealing with the Inhuman issue.  The show does a good job of keeping in sync with the Marvel movie universe and as such, makes a strong part of integrating it into the Disney Marvel movies franchise.  Good story lines with a mix of good character build ups and good special effects, it makes for good viewing as well a must have for those who are looking for completing their Marvel film collection.
Awesome television series, worth taking the time to watch and re watch again.
The negatives on this is that with it being an Amazon exclusive, they cut back of the features from the first season Blu ray set.  Just bloopers and deleted scenes and no paperwork inside to even explain what is on the disc. No Disney Rewards on this either for those who care, it is as plain minimalist a set as it gets, a disappointing surprise in that regard.
For the Marvel video completest a must have, for someone on the fence, I would highly suggest waiting for this to go on sale to make it a worthy buy.

Please Note this is a great show...HOWEVER This post and rating is due to the price. Please do not purchase this product at this price. If you do they will do this every year. Not sure why the price is so high for a five disc set. I purchased the entire series of Entourage on blu-ray for this price. This is price gouging of the highest order, and making sure you can not purchase it anywhere else is just disgusting. ABC should be ashamed of themselves, and Amazon should be ashamed of themselves for contributing to it. I have collected all the films so far, and even season one of SHIELD, and would have continued to buy them every year the show was released, however if this will be the new practice, I will not.

7329720,3,B0117UHFU4,"I stuck with the first season of Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. and felt I was rewarded by the end result.  The twist they did that tied in to the second Captain America movie really helped the final third of that season.  I was looking forward to seeing how theyd move things forward in season 2.  Sadly, it was a decided step down from season 1.

The season picks up a couple months after the first season finale.  Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg) is now in charge of S.H.I.E.L.D. and trying to rebuild the organization.  The trouble hes having comes in many forms.  There are, of course, the double agents who are really working for Hydra.  There are the Hydra raids on some of the supposed safe locations.  Plus the government is trying to crack down on S.H.I.E.L.D.

Fortunately, he has his team in place to help.  Agent May (Ming-Na Wen) is going on missions in the field.  Former Agent Ward (Brett Dalton) is in custody, but he is only willing to talk to Skye (Chloe Bennet), even teasing her with information about her father.  Jemma (Elizabeth Henstridge) has gone under cover at a Hydra base.  And Fitz (Iain De Caestcker) is trying to recover from the brain damage he suffered at the end of the previous season.

Of course, Coulson has one other issue to deal with  he is regularly going into a trance and filling anything around him with drawings.  Is it fatal?  Is he crazy?  Can he overcome this side effect of his resuscitation?

There were several problems with the season.  First, the show seemed to go off in several weird directions.  I know, I know, this is a show set in a superhero universe.  Even so, they went some pretty strange places and just stayed there.  It made it hard for me to truly get into the show.

Then there are the new comers.  The cast of the show is greatly expanded from the cast that started out season one.  Honestly, there were too many of them, and it was hard to keep them all straight.  Plus, I just missed the chemistry the original cast had together.  This was driven home by an episode late in the season that had the original crew working together again.  It was my favorite episode of the season.  And don't get me started on how they didn't seem to know what to do with Ward.  He missed a lot of episodes this season.

The tie ins to the movies weren't as strong this season, either.  They were some passing references, but nothing more.  Of course, Avengers: Age of Ultron came out so late into the season, it would have been hard for them to do much with it as it was.

Having said all this, there were parts of the season I did enjoy.  When they let the characters shine, those moments were amazing.  I needed to see more of that humanness.  Some of the storylines did work for me.  But it seemed like if I enjoyed one episode, the next would disappoint.  It was that obviously uneven this season.  I think it was a case of trying to do too much with the show this season, and the result feeling unfocused.

I cant fault the actors for any of this.  They continued to grow into their characters and bring them to great life each week.  Likewise, the show was filled with believable special effects, which is always important for a fantasy show.

Im still on the fence about moving on with season three of this show.  Ill probably give it a few episodes to see what I think.  But unless they really turn it around, season two of Marvels Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. will be my last.",1442534400,,3429,4.4112

But I cancelled them and decided to go pick them up at my local DVD store. Not realizing it was an exclusive. I come back to order it, and the price is bloody outrageous. Changed to $71 on release day? Really Amazon? I realize you have zero competitors on this but you will drive away customers this way. I could probably watch this on Netflix. Assuming you haven't taken it from them. Seriously reconsider this and I pray this is only timed exclusive.
Marvel fans, I suggest we all hold off purchasing this and post reviews like this and maybe we'll see some change.",1442534400,141,850,4.525974025974026
7329724,4,B0117UHFU4,"I've spot checked several episodes, and the video and quality are quite good. I have no complaints there. And I'm a fan of the show, so inclined towards favoritism in my review. I do, however, have to dock 1 star for the rather egregious lack of special features. There is an amusing blooper reel, and a 10 minute string of deleted scenes from the entire season on the final disc. That's it. Now, I will say that much of the deleted scenes are very good; some I rather wish had been left in the episodes. So the quality of what is there is good. It's simply a matter that there is almost nothing there. It's an absurdly exaggerated case of quality over quantity. This is the MCU we're talking about; I shouldn't be able to get through every special feature in under 15 minutes. (That being said, in all fairness, I do own other blu rays that have over an hour of special features that are almost completely fluff material and a waste of time.)

Just be warned before you buy, especially considering the rather high price that Amazon is charging. I'm happy with what is there, even if I wish there was more, but not everyone will be.",1442534400,,1132,4.416267942583732
7329725,4,B0117UHFU4,"I lost a lot of respect for Amazon on this one. I have been waiting for this release and found out it was a Amazon exclusive which I was cool with, never had any issues with Amazon before. I love the show it really picks up mid way through the first season and the second was great which is why I'm pretty upset that Amazon is using this exclusive as a reason to double the price on a Blu-ray. With shipping this is a $80 Blu-ray. I would have happily paid $40 - $50 for this but over $70 that's terrible.",1442534400,107,505,4.00990099009901
7329726,5,B0117UHFU4,GREAT SERIES!!!!!! From season one to season two!!!! Getting better!,1442534400,,68,5.9
7329727,1,B0117UHFU4,"Amazon shipped my order (packaged with Agent Carter S1 Blu) in a padded envelope, so expect some minor to major damage to those slipcovers.  I'm not sure why this set was Amazon exclusive, but it's led to some of the most obvious price-rigging, starting at $55 and jumping to $72 on the day of release.  For comparison, with the wide release of S1 of Agents of SHIELD, competitive pricing on release week put the show in a range of $40 to $55 on blu-ray.

The special features are also lacking.  S1 of Agents of SHIELD blu-ray came with Deleted scenes, bloopers, VFX, behind the scenes at SDCC, a Marvel documentary and some episodes included commentary.  This set (S2) only comes with Deleted Scenes and Bloopers.  That's all.

If you are a hardcore fan of the Marvel Cinematic Universe and their offshoots in TV and Netflix like myself, you'll want to support them by buying the sets.  But your head and wallet will resist, because by existing standards, these are poor value releases (including the Agent Carter S1 set).

EDIT 9/20/2015
Felt I should add a little more information and expand upon my rating.  The 1 star is due to pricing and low amount of effort put into these releases.

Positives of this set include:
-The show itself.  Much stronger than Season 1, with very few filler episodes and a great expanded cast.
-Picture and Sound Quality.
-The packaging with slipcover has some beautiful artwork.

Deeper look at the Negatives:
-This set is mastered with English language 5.1 DTS-HD or 2.0 Dolby Digital Sound.  The only subtitle option is English for the hearing impaired.  Even compared to the Season 1 set, this is a downgrade as that came with Spanish and French subtitles.
-Each disk requires you to select each episode that you are going to watch, no full disk or season play options are available.  So you will be hearing the main menu theme a lot as you have to choose the next episode.  This is a major misstep, auto-play style options are a large part of ""binge-watching"".  A person who would like to watch multiple episodes in a row could be strongly influenced to choose Netflix over buying and watching a blu-ray just on this option alone.
-The overall menu layout and effort put into this set implies a quick job, even though the show wrapped over 4 months prior.",1442534400,212,2294,4.678304239401497
7329728,1,B0117UHFU4,"Fantastic show. Leaps and bounds better than the first season. And I really liked the first season. If I have one complaint, it's that Amazon made this TOO affordable, even going so far as to dropping a whopping $8 off the already too reasonable list price of $80. I have contacted Amazon through electronic mail to address this concern. I suggested we find a simple way for me to separately send Amazon the remaining $8 plus the other $20 missing from the original list price. Amazon has yet to respond. For this reason, I have regretfully had to give this item 1 star rather than the 5 stars it deserves.",1442534400,10,606,4.5181818181818185
7329729,3,B0117UHFU4,"Meh it was okay i guess. Just not my type of comic book show. I enjoyed Daredevil,Arrow,and Flash more but Agents is okay. I just felt the story dragged a lot for me and was pretty disappointed how they represented the In humans. Should have given them more justice.
