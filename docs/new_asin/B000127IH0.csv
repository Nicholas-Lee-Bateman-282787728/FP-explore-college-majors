1966386,1,B000127IH0,"I recenty viewed this film, and the entire time I was waiting for something realistic to happen. John Denver is sadly portrayed as a whimpy fool, with no strength,brains, passion for nature or writting, and no integrity.
I Think this film should have been called Annie's story, as Annie is shown as the strength behind, and dominator of his life. Not suprizing, considering the film was made after his death, and she was the chief consaultant. The film serves as a mockery of john Denver under the disguise of a dramatized biogaraphy.
To sum the film up it was poorly casted, poorly directed, presumptuous, and produced in the style of a Lifetime original movie. It might be good for a some laughs at John's expense, if you don't mind throwing away some money.",1171152000,20,760,4.7218045112781954

1966388,1,B000127IH0,"This movie was an extremely poor attempt to chronicle the life of one of the world's foremost environmental/humanitarian educators of our time.  John used his celebrity to further his beliefs and his passions and through his many admirers, those visions are being continued today.  The inaccuracies are far to numerous to mention as well as mundane portrayal by Chad Lowe.

If you want to see the REAL John Denver, I suggest you purchase ""Let This Be A Voice"" and/or ""John Denver: A Song's Best Friend.""",1136332800,25,503,4.894117647058824
1966389,1,B000127IH0,Chad Lowe's portrayal of John Denver comes off like a Saturday Night Live skit.  The fake singing and phony guitar playing are very apparent.  He is not believable as John Denver at all.  He whine's throughout the movie. Kristen Davis is better but she can't save this disaster. This movie make's John Denver look like a total boob which he was not.  Save your money on this one.,1132876800,34,379,4.529411764705882
1966390,2,B000127IH0,"While it interesting to have some decent actors associated with this film, it is also very disheartening for any of Johns fans to see so many inaccuracies in this production. The songs are mostly all out of chronological order, and Chad Lowe trying to mime to Johns voice while ""playing"" unconvincing guitar, does not work. Kristen Davis does a nice job of portraying ""Annie"", but the film fails to capture the quality of John's music, or his deep commitment to the causes, that drove so much of his work. There is no attempt to analyse why his life became such a struggle for a man at the top of the world. If Hal Thau was indeed involved so deeply with this project, its a crying shame that so many of the production details were poorly researched. John was a highly intelligent and passionate man who spoke in Congress, and lobbyed politicians  to help with his environment projects, but in this film he comes across as whinny and insipid - two things he was definately not.

The man deserved a better biopic of his fascinaing life than this tardy effort.",1103587200,57,1058,4.592592592592593
1966391,1,B000127IH0,"From the first minute of this so called biography, the facts have been tossed out the window. (They've got John singing ""This Old Guitar"" a full 10 years before he wrote it).

The list of inaccuracies is too long to list here (anyone who only saw this Movie would be shocked to learn that John has a brother! and a manager named Jerry . . . and TALENT!)

Hal Thau had a whole lot less to do with John's success than his manager Jerry Weintraub.

Flying for me was written for the Challenger Crew in 1986, not before his father died in 1982.

Geesh folks, how hard is it to check facts?

John deserved far better.

Note to Chad Lowe: John did not whine all the time and he did not writhe around on stage when he sang.

The only thing mildly amusing about this abomination is the whle 14 seconds devoted to his second marriage.

1966406,2,B000127IH0,"I don't know whose home this movie took me home to, but it wasn't Johns!  Like many reviewers said, this portrayal made a very good, intelligent, caring, and talented man look wormy and weak.  John was strong, but he was not a redneck who thought he had to blow all the time to make the world think he was tough.  He was above that.  He tried to use his strength to do good in this world.  He was the major influence on me both musically and intellectually.  I've written almost 50 songs now and play finger style very similar to John and it was his inspiration that gave me that fantastic part of my life.  I was proud that someone devoted film footage to honor him, but I sincerely wish that it had been thoroughly researched, produced and directed.  Like John, I have a deep appreciation for truth and didn't mind if the movie accurately portrayed the few faults that John possessed.  I don't think he would have had a problem with that.

Like Carl Sagan, John was one in a BILLION . . . A free thinking, liberal minded progressive in a world becoming ever more regressive in the 1980's.  He came of age in the '60's  when attitudes about drugs and alcohol were permissive and that became a problem for John.  That one difference between us, which I address in my song, IT'S UP TO YOU AND ME,  is about the personal responsibility we have in this world to make it a better place and how our choices influence that.  I believe he would have loved my song, and I wish he could have known what he brought into my life.  I wish his mother, brother, and Annie could know.  I wish his children could know.

I hope someone will honor John properly with another movie in the near future.  He was a tremendous human being and I considered him my brother.  His spirit . . . His space and time on this planet deserve and demand a better effort.",1376956800,,1836,4.312865497076023
1966407,5,B000127IH0,"I have watched this movie several times after it first appeared on TV.  I grew up listening to John Denver with my parents.  I was pleased to know that the movie was based on his own story.  Good actors, touching story.  well done.",1368576000,,231,4.3023255813953485
1966408,5,B000127IH0,I grew up enjoying John Denver and hie music and was sick when I heard that he had died. He was one of my favorite singers and I will always enjoy his music and his movies. I really enjoyed the movie and was surprised of some of the things he went though during his life. I really enjoyed the movie. Thank You,1363996800,,309,4.0
1966409,4,B000127IH0,"This is a good docudrama for people that new John Denver for his great music and philanthropy!

The movie is fairly accurate account of his life but if you did not know John for his passion to make the

world a better place you might get the idea  he was some sort of troubled soul.",1358380800,,282,4.090909090909091
1966410,1,B000127IH0,"So irritating. Especially Lowe. First thing I could think of was ""where have I seen this actor before?"". Then I did a quick search and realized that Lowe was on ER a few years back as a really annoying, allergic, whiny medical student who fails his ER rotation. Chad Lowe is type-cast for that type of whiny and itchy character. He is a horrible John Denver, and the supporting cast is just as bad.

My husband checked this out of the library, so not a big deal to waste a few minutes on it, but I am very disappointed. I love Denver's music and his voice- his personal life was wanting but that's true of a lot of creative types. I was a kid when he died, but I don't think Denver was as annoying- given his music he couldn't have been- as the movie makes him out to be. The memory of Denver could be much better served in future with a movie featuring actual singers (think the Johnny Cash story) and a much better cast of actors and a more accurate script.

Nothing about this movie was any good except the music by John Denver. Period. I know I used annoying a lot in this review but.. uck.. Chad Lowe as John Denver is like an itch I can't get rid of. Not worth your time.",1357171200,2,1177,4.157894736842105

1966412,1,B000127IH0,"This movie is crap compared to ""Walk The Line"" about Johnny Cash (and I heard he had the opportunity to decide which actor plays him). The Songs they played and the situation John was in (in the Movie) didn't fit, especially the Scene where they played ""Flying for Me"" (which was written after Spaceshuttle Challenger crashed down and John almost flew in that Shuttle and in the last Minute they decided a teacher to fly instead).
Kristin does a good Job though. But she can't make this a good Movie.
Also the ""singing"" of Chad and the Music we hear isn't even synchrone.
this hurts every John Denver Fan. My hope is that they bring out a new one some time soon and that that one is much better.
To all John denver Fans: DON'T BUY IT! All others: you might not reading this anyway.",1326585600,2,781,4.393103448275862
1966413,2,B000127IH0,"The actor playing Denver's hair seems to grow from a fine light growth to full on Denver-style through the movie i.e. the wig dept. needed greater financial backing. Though, to a serious review. As a lecturer for Bachelor of Music students in psychology, education and philosophy, it adds nothing to understanding the man behind the music or the origins of the songs. Vital clues as to what made him such an expert guitarist from an '""old F - hole jazz guitar"" are not explored. The songs are out of chronological order. Even a non-musician can tell this, as Denver's voice did deepen as he aged (as does everyone's). Take a note of his range in 'It's about Time' - that is, the song - (circa 1983) compared to Annie's Song (1974) or any other song from the live recodring at the Universal Amphitheatre. The way 'Annie' is portrayed is in no way how I have seen her interviewed since his death. Surely she wasn't so lacking in confidence and self-assertion for an undergrad. psych. student in the '60s? I do not believe she suddenly gained her confidence after the separation with Denver - it was there all the time. This DVD (one presumes, made for TV) came out in 1999. It seems like a rush job as a first attempt at ensuring Denver's music, message and life's purpose are released to the masses via mass media. At this it works. What upset me the most was the neglect of the ""An Evening with John Denver"" series of concerts at the Universal Amphitheatre - this, I argue (perhaps like 'Hot August Night', for Neil Diamond) was the turning point of his career from fairly well known recording and live star in the United Satates to superstar around the world. Hal Blain (I think the percussionist from Aspen) is there, but he only has a role for Denver to bounce his lines off. Milt Okun is hardly seen, yet was pivotal in the success of Denver's recording and performance career. By the way, where was Lee Holdridge? The best review for this DVD is to tell the reader to watch it - then watch all the stuff that has come out since (live concerts on DVD in Australia, Japan, Germany, etc - especially the impromptu concert at a football field in the suburbs of Sydney. Plus, the posthumous DVD with Annie, Lee Holdridge and Milt Okun which includes footage of some songs in concert, including one at 'Red Rocks' which makes one feel like one is there), then listen to all his live music: then you will be close to knowing the real John Denver (oh, I forgot his own autobiography).",1316649600,2,2481,4.527839643652562
1966414,1,B000127IH0,A couple of things I remember about this movie are: John Denver looks like he's got a stump up his butt as he grimaces all the time. Perhaps he was the inspiration for Kristen Stewart.(?) He whines and is about to have a heart attack when he returns from a long tour to his house in the mountains and is more concerned about the trees the wife had the have chopped down so that the builders could expand the house than his wife and her loneliness. A classic in white man's graphic expression of pain!!! Then there's the part when he tries to resolve every problem by singing a song until one funny scene when he begins to sing one to resolve yet another problem and his wife forces him to stop. Millions of viewers were grateful for that scene. HAHAHAHAHAHAAAAA!!!! Feels more like a comedy than a bio pic.,1311897600,,806,4.38
1966415,1,B000127IH0,"This film is terrible and not worth one penny to be bought and seen. I am a big John Denver fan and this film made a mockery out of John Denver. Who ever wrote the script to this terrible movie didn't seem to care about FACTS, instead focused more on fabrications and twisted lies. I am still waiting on a real bio-movie of John Denver that shows him loving his music and sharing it with the fans. Look who they pick to play John Denver, someone who could not sing or act. It is like they wanted to get this movie done in a hurry and spend less on making it. so they got the cheapest actor they could get to play John Denver. I've seen movies like Buddy Holly. Johnny Cash, and Ray Charles and at least they took time to tell both sides of the story. This phony movie they did of John Denver was done unjustly and those who rated this film 5 stars obviously know nothing about John Denver or his music. FACT CHECK your info. before you rate a supposenly ""true Story"" movie to see if it is accurate or just plain Hollywood garbage, gossip, gutter, trashy, conclusions.",1286841600,4,1067,4.261083743842365

I'm sure Chad Lowe could have done a much better job but maybe he was directed to act that way.  I found the rest of the cast ok and Kristen Davis was the most believable.  I so wanted it to be a wonderful movie about a wonderful man and entertainer.  All I got from the movie was pretty bad acting and not a lot of correct information.",1282694400,,605,4.008333333333334

1966418,1,B000127IH0,"This movie is trash. Chad Lowe's acting is pathetic, and the entire production does a terrible disservice to the most popular performing artist of the 1970's. John Denver had his faults like all people, but he was a gifted musician, singer and songwriter who used his fame for good all around the world.

The acting was miserable and although I do like Chad Lowe, this was not the part for him.  Gerald McRaney was nothing more than his ""Major Dad"" character and there was hardly any mention at all that John even had a brother.  In addition, I stopped counting the number of mistakes and mis=information after the first 10 minutes!  This was a real embarassement to the memory of this incredible human being and although we all appreciate any media coverage, this was one of the worst!

1966421,1,B000127IH0,"There are quite a few inaccuracies in this movie, but what bothers me most is Lowe's portrayal of Denver which was completely unrecognizable as the real man. Not only did Lowe look nothing like Denver, but more importantly, John Denver did not stammer off set or off stage!  It is as if they only saw JD in ""Oh God!"" where he played a stammering grocery store clerk.  The real John Denver was intelligent, articulate and self assured.  He rarely, if ever stammered in any of the many interviews that I've seen or in other movies or TV shows that he starred in.  Why they chose to portray Denver as a stammering, insecure loser, I'll never know but it is quite upsetting. He deserves much better.

Lowe barely spoke a line in the first half of the movie without stammering and many lines are just awful and depict him as a fool. Here are a few actual lines from the movie, verbatim.

John in his 2nd encounter with Annie: "" Hi, Hi, I'm, I'm, I'm John Denver.  We, uh, we had a talk, well.. after that concert a few months back.""
Annie:  ""A talk?""
John:  ""Well yes.  You said `Hi' back.  That's kind of like a talk right? I, uh, got your address from one of the guys at the, uh, at the frat house.""

Shame on CBS for airing this heap of trash. To tell the truth, I am actually kind of surprised that a lawsuit hasn't been filed against the production company or CBS for this junk. Other reviews will tell you what is wrong with this film better than I can, but I want to point out one particular scene: Where JD is recording the song ""Flying For Me."": The ""parody JD"" is pacing the recording studio and he's restless. Something's not quite right with the song. He gets an idea. ""How about an orchestra?"" This has got to be one of the stupidest (if not, the stupidest) part of the movie.

The story begins in the early 60s as John (Chad Lowe) begins his folk singing career.  He meets Annie (Kristin Davis) at a gig and falls in love on the spot.

This movie is a Cliffs Notes summary of John's life; it's poorly-written and amateurish and lacks any depth or emotion.  Lowe (who dons a hideous clown wig that makes him look like Dana Carvey in ""Wayne's World"") mugs shamelessly throughout, playing a leering  innocent who never seems to grow up. (In fact, though the film covers thirty years, no one ages.)  Davis is very pretty but the horrible script doesn't give her much chance to develop.  McRaney, as John's father,  plays the only character who seems real, and he's the villain of the piece.

The story is shallow and Lowe's Denver isn't particularly likeable.  His hair is so laughable and distracting that the movie doesn't have a chance.

With that said, his career is respectable and his activism is perhaps even more respectable.  I like biopics that show me something I didn't know, and considering I didn't know a lot about Denvers career arc, this movie was a decent introduction. I agree with many of the other reviews: the acting is inconsistent, the script somewhat uneven, and facts were altered.  However, though his portrayal may have been incomplete, the movie did provide a timeline that hit the high points and kept the storyline moving at a brisk pace. There is also the ample inclusion of 15 Denver songs.  After watching this movie I enjoyed much time on youtube watching the real John Denver. What a talent. Its a shame he died young. There is no telling where his creativity would have taken him, and where his activism would have taken others.",1433116800,2,957,4.644970414201183

8005324,1,B000127IH0,"This film is indeed shocking.
The only redeeming bit is the all too short clip where we see the real John Denver in Africa.
As many others have pointed out there are so many inaccuracies that this film is a total work of fiction.
Watch ' Let This Be A Voice ' - a wonderful documentary that JD recorded just a few months before we lost him.
That is the real John Denver.",1426118400,,370,4.082191780821918
