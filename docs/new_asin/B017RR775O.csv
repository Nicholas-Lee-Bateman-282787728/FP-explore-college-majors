7514447,3,B017RR775O,Pretty weird movie.  My 5 and 7 year olds liked it though.  I don't think some of the dialog translated very well.,1476403200,,114,4.136363636363637
7514448,5,B017RR775O,this movie is awesome,1472688000,2,21,4.5
7514449,3,B017RR775O,Graphics are rather outdated but the lessons for kids are good.,1470700800,,63,4.818181818181818
7514450,5,B017RR775O,"Lovely film featuring the wonderful, classic Moomins characters! The diverse personalities of the characters really make the movie. While some dark themes might not be right for all very young viewers, for the most part this film is suitable and enjoyable for all ages. The story inspires curiosity and bravery as Moomintroll and friends tackle unexpected challenges on their quest for knowledge and the truth about their fate. The movie is easy to follow and it is quite amusing to see these characters interact and share their philosophies on life. I would definitely recommend this film, don't worry if you've never experienced the Moomins before - you'll love them!",1465171200,4,669,5.146788990825688

8740275,1,B017RR775O,"The only female character was obsessed with her hair and her appearance, and anytime she did anything good or brave, she said it was because she ""didn't have to think,"" she just did it. I mean, what the heck? That is not the kind of female role model I want for my son and daughter. It was actually an interesting move otherwise (fun animation style, interesting premise) but I cannot get over that kind of terrible representation.",1500595200,6,431,4.6103896103896105
8740276,1,B017RR775O,"Probably among one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The song in the beginning of the movie cusses and the whole rest of the movie just seemed so random and hardly made any sense. I would recommend Richard Scarry or Berenstain Bears cartoons for kids instead. I would give a 0 star rating, but I had to give it at least one.",1486166400,,326,4.190476190476191
8740277,5,B017RR775O,"Love, Love, Love the Moomins.  And Bjork kicks off the opening score - bonus!  My girls (5) and (10) also loved seeing their favorite characters come alive.",1484179200,3,156,4.7407407407407405

8740279,5,B017RR775O,"A bit dark, but charming.",1481414400,,25,4.2
8740280,3,B017RR775O,Can the original Finnish version be available? The English doesn't translate well!  I have been reading Moomin for 40 years. It just feels cheapened somehow and lost in translation.,1478995200,,181,5.241379310344827
8740281,1,B017RR775O,The only female character on the show is stupid and vain. Why would my girls watch this?,1478304000,3,88,4.235294117647059
8740282,5,B017RR775O,"Awesome,  great.",1478304000,,16,7.0
8740283,4,B017RR775O,Kind of weird but interesting enough for an adult and it didn't freak my toddler girls out and maintained their interests.,1476921600,,122,4.857142857142857
