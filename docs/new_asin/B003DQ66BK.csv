8394881,3,B003DQ66BK,"Aside from being your basic Japanese quirky comedy, Kakera has some incredibly saddening moments. Revolving around the love affair between Haru, a hapless student with a child-like personality and Riko, a bisexual medical artist who creates prosthetic body parts. Not only does Momoko manage to capture the sweet side of innocent romance, she realistically creates the sense of confusion, discomfort and pain that sometimes comes with a relationship. Haru, never quite having the strength to leave her boyfriend, even though she knows he is seeing someone else brings a much needed side-plot to the not-so strong story of a, frankly, strange lesbian relationship. I think this film's heart's in the right place, but it's just not beating in time with the character's. As the film slowly drifts through the second half, it seems more apparent that none of the characters have a clue what's going on and where any relationships are actually going.
and not to forget, Kakera has some absolutely hilarious moments.
It's wasn't a chore to sit through this film at all, but it'll be a while before I watch it again.",1357084800,,1109,5.032608695652174
