2566950,4,B000FIHJ9W,"Bai Ling got a Chinese Academy Award for her portrayal of Aunt Mei -- an ex-doctor who sells fetus dumplings. She is both dramatic and sexy in this role, and she really gets to show her chops. I like her role because it is a more substantial role than what she is offered in the USA. Yes, I am a Bai Ling fan and she is the reason I viewed this film. Yes, this is a Hong Kong film with English subtitles. All the roles are well played. The story is not so freakishly gory as some reviews would have you believe. But it does highlight an aspect of the Chinese culture, which you might call cannibalistic. The cinematography (Christopher Doyle) is top notch. Hard to believe this film is almost ten years old. Directed by Fruit Chan.",1383696000,11,731,4.304347826086956
2566951,2,B000FIHJ9W,"I would give it three stars but there are some very gross scenes, this is a very weird movie. It's well acted and directed, but it is such a bizarre story. It's about a rich woman who is losing her husband and finds a way to stay young, the woman who is making her dumplings has 'secret' ingredient that will shock you. I am surprised that I watched this movie the whole way through, and except for the gross scenes was a pretty good movie. Spoiler Alert!

2566954,3,B000FIHJ9W,"Erotic and sensual in a rather ghoulish way, Dumplings is something of a curate's egg. The performances are uniformly absorbing and the cinematography excellent. The depiction of life in Mei's drab, squalid, kitschy Hong Kong flat is compelling. But this is adapted from a novella, and was first  produced as a vignette in a three-part movie. Here, extended to a full 90 minutes, the film stretches the motif too thinly, and thus dilutes it's impact. But this is an interesting morality tale nonetheless, and well worth watching.",1244937600,,529,5.080459770114943
2566955,4,B000FIHJ9W,"Those who have seen the short in the Asian Horror compilation ""Three Extremes"" would know what the premise of ""Dumplings"" is all about. This is the 90 minute uncut version of Fruit Chan's highly disturbing horror thriller (Cat. III=NC-18). Why not do a review of ""Three Extremes"" instead of this film? Well, first of all, the film is a more extensive version and secondly, the film is a nice blend of calculated direction, is entertainingly haunting and expresses a realistic idea of human vanity and errors. Based on the novella by Lillian Lee (Farewell My Concubine), Chan's award-winning ""Dumplings: Three Extremes"" is deliciously appetizing and at the same time quite repulsive because of its main premise.

A former actress, Mrs. Ching Li (Miriam Yeung) is a former movie star whose past fame is behind her. Afraid that her womanizing husband (played by Tony Leung made to look older) would leave her for a younger woman, she approaches a mysterious woman called Aunt Mei (Bai Ling). Aunt Mei looks somewhat trashy but alluringly attractive--very sexy. Apparently Mei makes these ""dumplings"" that hold the secret to eternal youth and they are very expensive. Her main ingredient: aborted human FETUS. Ching is a desperate woman who decides that any price is worth her youth and beauty, she wants to regain her husband`s affection. Little does she know that she has set off a chain of events that would prove too high a price, far beyond her imagination.

The ""secret"" ingredient is actually shown within the first 5-10 minutes of the film and as anyone would predict, it would come at a price. The film isn't at all that bloody or gory; it's just that the very idea of ingesting human fetus in the form of dumplings is truly able to upset and unsettle its viewer. What is also more unsettling is the fact that Aunt Mei is so casual about it, surely a very intelligent woman with a very wicked madness. The film explores human vanity, lust and vengeance. Yes, the film is worth watching, there is more to ""Dumplings"" than the version seen in ""Three Extremes"".

Ching Li is a woman very dependent on her husband. She knows she has a lot to lose if ever he divorces her. The situation is actually the main villain in this film, Aunt Mei is just its tool. Ching's womanizing husband supplies the motivation. The relationship between Mei and Ching actually takes center stage as they develop a strange bond as she ingests her daily meal of the ""magical"" dumpling. Ching does exhibit the same mixed feelings about the special meat as the audience, but she is very determined to follow through.

The film also serves up a lot of depth to Aunt Mei's character which wasn't shown in its short version. Mei was a former doctor in Mainland China who had performed abortions, everyone knows that China has a ""one child"" rule; the country has the largest population in the world. Mei has performed 30,000 abortions in a year and so she has never birthed a child herself, her former boyfriend fears that her pregnancy may become cursed. The easy access to human embryos is more fleshed out and the details are presented in disturbing fashion.

The special ingredient itself is given a lot of character, Mei reveals the origins of the procedure that came from ancient China. However, twisted it may be, the legends surrounding youthful beauty had been known and practiced by the early Chinese emperors, and the practice had been used to cure diseases. Dimsum have always been a treat for the Chinese as well as other countries; it was quite clever for the writer to make the famous delicacy the vehicle for the cannibalistic ritual. The fantastic cinematography by Christopher Doyle is to be commended, and the style is reflected by Miriam Yeung and Bai Ling's enchantingly beautiful complexions.

Lust is further explored as the film does contain quite a fair amount of mild nudity and sex. Miki Yeung plays Connie, the mistress. The woman is given a fair amount of screen time. Mei and Mr. Li actually form their own relationship. Mei finds herself wanting the enriched life Ching lives while Li is a man obsessed with youthful beauty, he loves young pretty women and sex. It was also quite ironic that Li consumes a good amount of the Filipino delicacy called ""Balut"" (aborted duck eggs) to keep his sexual energy. However, the film has an added twist as Mr. Li becomes seduced by Mei herself, because she desires a man`s warm touch. (I wouldn't blame him) Mei is woman supposed to be in her sixties but when played by Bai Ling with her fabulous looks, she is quite a sexually inviting woman. Mei is more a eye-candy than a breathing character in the film but Bai Ling gives Aunt Mei a very real feel, as much as a near-immortal woman can be.

The final act of the film actually diverts from the shorter version in ""Three Extremes"" and it is more effective and definitely affecting. Ching's descent into madness that results in her exacting vengeance adds an exclamation point to the film. It is a little predictable but nonetheless very disturbing. These characters are very unlikable, and ugly inside. Their disturbed actions adds more ""visceral"" punch when they act so leisurely about it. The lack of a repulsed reaction is the film's greatest asset although some may deem it a little too slow-paced. However, good the proceedings are, it does lack some definition that may prove a little unworthy of its very alarming subject matter.

""DUMPLINGS"" is a bizarrely explicit descent into madness and what is so ironic about the film is that its ugliness comes from the pursuit of beauty. It is effectively transfixes that ugliness comes from the inside. While the idea of devouring human embryos is its major ""gross-out"" feature, there is barely any MAJOR displays of blood and gore. The storytelling managed to get under the skin and leaves the impression that the film is actually more gory than it really is. The film is definitely very cold, but exhilarating and full of affecting elements. It is appetizingly horrific that the taste may leave a repulsive after-taste in your mouth.

Recommended timidly because of its nature [4- Stars]
The 2-disc Lionsgate dvd release of ""Three Extremes"" actually has this film on the second disc. (I'm told) I own the HK region-3 release.",1222819200,7,6271,4.809833024118738
2566956,4,B000FIHJ9W,"Dumplings (Fruit Chan, 2004)

Fruit Chan's mesmerizing short ""Dumplings"", which appeared in the anthology flick Three...Extremes (and was better than either Takashi Miike or Chanwook Park's entries), is also a full-length film. Having seen the short, when I got around to watching the whole film, I have to say I expected more of the same, an extended director's cut of the short. Oh, no, folks. The feature-length Dumplings is, in many ways, an entirely different film.

Auntie Mei (The Crow's Ling Bai) runs a dumpling shop in Hong Kong famous for its special ""rejuvenation dumplings"", which promise to return to women the looks of their youth. Mrs. Lee (Love Undercover's Miriam Yeung), an aging television star whose husband has lost interest in her, hears about the dumplings and heads for Mei's place to get some. After a bit of initial discomfort with the secret ingredient of the dumplings (which is revealed in the opening scene, if you're observant), she starts making regular appointments-- but when she discovers hard evidence her husband is cheating on her with a younger woman, she wants to step the process up. That involves greater risk for everyone involved. And then, to complicate matters, Mr. Lee (the great Tony Leung) meets Aunt Mei...

What Dumplings is depends entirely on how you look at it. Is it a horror film? It certainly has horrific elements about it. Is it a comedy? If so, it makes Very Bad Things look like a Jim Carrey vehicle. A drama about fading love? A treatise on the dangers of smuggling? A cautionary tale against vanity? It is, to some extent, all these things and more. All of which I probably said (and if I didn't I should have) in my review of three...extremes, where the short version of this film popped up. Why you want to see the feature-length version of Dumplings is that there's so much more. (I touched on it above; the whole sequence with Mr. Lee and Mei doesn't exist in the shorter version.) There are whole new subplots. More importantly, there's a whole new tone-- the short version of the film is a pretty straightforward, if gross and horrific, comedy of manners. The long version is, in many ways, heartbreaking, even while it is still a gross and horrific comedy of manners.

I've seen some great DVD extras (the special edition of Se7en is particularly wonderful in this regard) where the director talks about the deleted scenes and how the editing process works on one select scene to make the whole a more powerful vision. Watching both versions of Dumplings is a fantastic opportunity to see this process in action-- how you can take the same scenes, add a few more, shift one or two around, and get a totally different experience. Highly recommended-- if you can get past the gross-out factor. About which I meant to wax rhapsodic, but I will simply say this-- Dumplings will give you a whole new level of respect for people who do sound effects editing. ****",1199318400,9,2928,4.780632411067193

2567055,5,B000FIHJ9W,"This film literally leaves a bad taste in one's mouth, but not because it's badly made - it's the subject matter that is rather, err, unpalatable. Director Fruit Chan certainly captures the theme of eternal youth in a manner that leaves a memorable impression, for after watching this film, you'll not soon forget it. I watched this years ago when it was first distributed and revisited it this afternoon. It remains as compelling as ever.

Chinese actress Bai Ling plays a dumpling maker whose services are in high demand because her dumplings are special. There is one unique ingredient that helps restore youth to the one who consumes the dumpling. A former TV star who was once in high demand desperately turns to Aunt Mei the dumpling maker, hoping to restore her fading beauty and save her crumbling marriage.

Despite the rather unsavory nature of this film (you'll understand why when you watch it), there is much to appreciate here: the sense of menace belying Aunt Mei's outwardly affable demeanor (she entertains her clients by singing Chinese songs of yesteryear), Mei's sinister visits to a local hospital known for its high abortion rate, and more. A couple of minutes into the film, the viewer gets clued in as to what the special ingredient for the dumplings are, and it is truly stomach churning. Beware: there are graphic images in this film, including one of an abortion.

Once you get past this, the story itself is riveting. Growing up in South East Asia, I used to hear about the atrocities committed in the name of beauty such as the practice of wearing special metal like objects under one's skin called ""susuk"" (a Malay term) using black magic, and so this particular story is not really unusual in parts of Asia, despite its repugnant nature. It certainly is a thought-provoking film begging that perennial question, ""What price beauty?""",1417132800,3,1863,4.889240506329114
