8361919,5,B002BU0RNW,"As I became a christian this year, after being out of church for over 26 years, Jesse Duplantis is one of those people I connected with via TBN.  I'm a fellow Louisiana resident and he helped me on my journey.  I read the entire bible in 4 months and was saved/baptised in that time period as well.  It's sad that I didn't come to Jesus sooner.  Glory to God and thank you Jesse for the steps along the way.  You can't go wrong with Jesse.  Just remember, keep your prayers going up to God, in the name of Jesus Christ.  Jesus is the only way to heaven.  Don't be one of those folks, at the last hour, wishing they had come to him sooner.  Spread the good news folks.",1416182400,,667,4.108527131782946
