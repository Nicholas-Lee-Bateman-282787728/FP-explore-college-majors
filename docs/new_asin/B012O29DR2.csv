7357293,5,B012O29DR2,The new blu Rays look awesome.  Thanks lionsgate for giving us our blurays!!!!  They look much better than than the crappy dvds!!,1439078400,23,129,4.818181818181818
7357294,5,B012O29DR2,"I won't buy the DVD version. It figures that I buy the first 6 in Blu-Ray and then Lionsgate decides they don't want to finish the series. Where can we write to Lionsgate that they are ripping off the consumer, if I knew they were going to do this I would never have bought the first 6 Blu-Ray seasons. SHAME ON YOU LIONSGATE FOR RIPPING OFF THE VIEWERS!!

UPDATE: I received my blu-ray season 7 from Amazon and I'm so glad that Lionsgate has listened to the fans, the packaging and menus are different from prior seasons 1-6 but that is ok. I'm very happy and now changing my review stars from 1 to 5. Even though it's a MOD blu-ray it still gets a 5 stars as picture 10x's better than DVD.",1439078400,52,691,4.195488721804511

I've supported their Bluray releases for Little House and preordered all 6 seasons as they came out only to now be told thats the end of it. The very least they could do is release the final 3 seasons and the 3 movies in some kind of set so us Bluray fans can at least finish the series off. I'm in the UK so I can't do downloads , not that I would even if I could. Lionsgate need to do something otherwise any future multi season releases just won't get any support.",1438992000,51,621,4.098360655737705

7357297,4,B012O29DR2,"UPDATE: The Blu-ray (an Amazon exclusive) has been released.  Originally Lionsgate stopped Blu-ray releases after S6, but to their credit they found an alternate way to continue putting Blu-ray's out by partnering with Amazon.  The bottom line is that while I have a few items of concern, I am overall satisfied with this release, though it is definitely a barebones release.  The overall quality is a little lower than previous seasons but is still good enough - and the discs are regular pressed Blu-ray discs (NOT BD-R's).  While there are some concerns, let me first address the picture/audio quality.

Picture quality: In general, it is ""in line with"" what we've come to expect on Blu-ray.  It is incredibly detailed and clear and overall looks alright.  It is noticeably better than DVD.  I won't lie though - of the 9 seasons, this one has the worst visual quality, but it's still lightyears better than what was previously available.  There's 2 reasons for the decrease this season: (1)  It was seemingly originally produced with a purposefully more ""bland""/""pale"" look - there's a lot more bland colors (browns/greys/blacks) in this season.  I remember thinking that S7 looked ""different"" from previous seasons on the old DVD's too and that's partly I think just because of the way it was originally produced. (2) The other reason is that some of the video has clearly faded which further contributes to the sometimes blander look, but this is not consistent.  Some episodes look really good and vibrant (such as the last 2) and some like ""The Nephews"" clearly have more of that ""faded 70's look"" and look more muted. It is clear that some of the original film for some episodes suffered damage over time that others did not.  I don't think the color is absolutely right on this remastered release (which is the same on the new DVD and the streaming) but it is definitely overall better and ""more natural"" as compared to the old DVD's.

There are also a few minor issues (the 1st episode in particular has some very noticeable scan lines/flecks) and like previous releases, the quality can be somewhat variable from shot-to-shot. However, all things considered, the picture quality is decent.  It is amusing to see, in beautiful HD, that Mary actually has a ""beard"" in the beginning of ""To See the Light""! :)  To clear up some confusion/wrong information out there, the bitrates for the S7 blu-ray are on par with previous seasons.  I took 2 random episodes from previous seasons (1 from S5 and 1 from S6) and looked at their quality and bitrates.  They both had an overall bitrate (video+audio) of about 22mbps.  On Season 7, basically the way it works out is the first 10 episodes on S7 have an overall bitrate of 18-20mbps and the remaining 12 episodes are about 25mbps - in other words some S7 episodes have a little lower bitrate than previous season episodes and some a bit higher.  They all are a much higher bitrate than streaming (Digital HD) which seems to top out at about 10mbps.

Audio quality:  The audio is NOT lossless as was previously the case, however it is encoded as a 448k DD track, which is over twice the bitrate of most DVD stereo tracks (including the S7 DVD).  While I always prefer lossless, I can promise you after listening through my studio headphones that the bitrate itself is mostly a non-issue!  448k for this mono audio track is perfectly fine.  In tests using my studio headphones (as a relative audiophile) with the previous season's lossless tracks, I couldn't tell hardly any difference between the lossless and a 384k track (let alone 448k), so the bitrate is fine!  The real issue with the audio on this season isn't the bitrate, but the way the audio was mastered which is different from the previous releases.  It doesn't sound as ""full-bodied"" (though dialogue is clearer than previous if you can believe it) and the audio experiences ""clipping"" periodically where the levels got pushed too high which distorts the sound a tad when it happens. Season 7 and 8 blu's both have this issue (fixed in S9), however it overall is a relatively minor issue and not one you would even likely notice unless watching with headphones on.  The audio is still LIGHTYEARS better than the old DVD's.

The bottom line on the audio/video quality is that while it is a tad lower, it is still generally ""in line"" with what we've been used to on Blu-ray and is still obviously better/clearer than the DVD counterpart.  For me, actually owning the episodes themselves in good HD quality on solid Blu-ray discs is all that I really care about and that's what this release delivers, so I am satisfied.  However, there are some ""other issues"" (some of which may be very important to you):

- There are subtitle issues - with them being a bit out-of-sync.  It's not generally terrible, but it is noticeable.  For some episodes, it's not a big deal, whereas on others it's more noticeable and a problem.  This IS frustrating and I do consider this a more significant issue.  When you recall that some of the original old DVD releases didn't even have subtitles, it helps to put it in a bit of perspective, but it's still frustrating.  I don't know if the DVD has these same issues or not.

- The Spanish & French audio tracks are a bit out-of-sync with the video.  Like the subtitle issue, I consider this a significant problem.  If they are going to include foreign language tracks then they need to ensure that they are ""in sync"" with the video.

- All the episodes appear uncut EXCEPT for ""Divorce, Walnut Grove Style"" which is missing a few scenes (3 minutes). This isn't a Blu-ray only issue but also is the same on the DVD's and Digital Copy.  Across the 9 seasons, this and S9's Home Again are the two episodes with the most significant edits on the remasters.

- The menu is simple and static.  It doesn't match the look/feel of previous seasons, but it still looks fine and uses the HD cover picture as its background so it's not terrible looking.  Basically it just allows you to choose the episode you want or change audio/subtitle options.  There is no scene selection from the menu nor bookmarks as was the case on previous seasons.  Overall, while a slight letdown/inconvenience, the menu is ""fine"" in my book.

- If you choose to skip the opening theme song using the next chapter button on your remote, you'll find it does NOT start you right after the theme song as was the case with previous seasons but rather a bit later in the episode.  Of the 9 seasons, this is the only one that has this problem.

- There are no extras.  I also didn't expect any.  Even the previous 6 seasons only had one 15-minute clip of a special as their one and only extra (except for S1 which also had one quick additional extra).  Since the last part of that special documentary ended with the 6th season, I didn't really expect any extras on S7.  The S7 DVD also does NOT have any extras so the Blu-ray users aren't getting shafted here any more than the DVD users.

- There are no UV/streaming codes (like the DVD has).  The previous seasons of the new Blu-ray releases had them, but this one does not.  I assume that this has to do with some legality/license issue with the fact that this is an Amazon exclusive MOD title.  In any event, it's not a big deal.  If you REALLY want the streaming and care about that, the entire series has been available for super cheap (and I do mean SUPER cheap) from other popular online video services at numerous points including very recently.

- There is no slipcover.  I didn't expect one, either.  I knew this was a barebones release that Lionsgate put out for the fans as an exclusive Amazon Manufacture-on-Demand Title and thus I knew a slipcover wasn't likely to be there.  I know it can be a little letdown to some since without it, it doesn't ""match"" the other seasons if you put them next to each other on your shelf, but it is at the end of the day a very minor issue.

So there you have it - that's the skinny.  The bottom line is this Blu-ray release is definitely a barebones release where Lionsgate obviously cut numerous corners (presumably to keep costs down).  Some of that ""corner cutting"" is okay by me (i.e. simple menu/no slipcover), but some of it I consider a problem (subtitle & Spanish sync issues).  While a letdown compared to the previous releases and I can understand some frustration, the core episodes themselves are in tact and in generally similar quality, which at the end of the day is the most important thing.  I understand that some could be frustrated that they've paid a few dollars more for basically less than what they've gotten in the past.  But I also recognize that this release almost didn't even happen - the old retail model was obviously not financially feasible for Lionsgate to continue releasing these blu's - and they, while cutting several corners, did at least release the season under a different model (Amazon MOD) so fans could continue to complete their set and where it could also be financially profitable for them.  You'll need to decide if it's enough for you to just get the episodes themselves in HD quality on blu, or whether you aren't satisfied only with that but are going to expect all the other goodies/touches too that you've been used to.  If the latter, you're going to be sorely disappointed.  For me, I've decided I am ok with just having the episodes and owning them (unlike the streaming that I don't really own) and have no problem paying a few more dollars to have them (if the alternative is to not get them at all, which IS what the alternative is).",1438905600,86,9595,4.64218009478673
7357298,2,B012O29DR2,"To edit my previous one star review, since Lionsgate has now 'graced' us with a Blu Ray release, I upped my review to two stars.  Why two and not five, since we now have a Blu Ray release for this season?  Simply because now that it has been released and we see what we got, I see Lionsgate just threw us a bone to shut us up.  Not the best way to keep customers even remotely happy, but they knew we'd buy it anyway. And not the same video quality as the previous seasons. Read on....

Unlike previous Blu Ray releases, this one is apparently 'On-Demand,' though by looking at the actual discs and packaging, you'll be hard pressed to see a difference, except this one does not come in a slipcase like the previous six seasons. So, every time you look at your lovely LHOP Blu Ray sets on your shelf this shall always be a reminder of how we got screwed by Lionsgate.  To add insult to injury, NO HD Digital version is included. That seems to be a feature available only for those other people who know no quality difference and are just as happy with the inferior DVD release and can buy it for $12.  Still, most of us sort of expected no HD copy was to be the case, but we dared hope Lionsgate would be decent enough.  Nope.

Now, this is a BIG one folks, the quality of the episodes is NOT as good as the previous seasons.  The bps is around 17-20 rather than 30 from previous seasons.  The sound is not DTS-HD but rather Dolby 2.0 ch.  They just threw these episodes bare bones into 5 Blu Ray discs as expediently and cheaply as they could and charged us more for less.

Another major difference in this release is the menu.  No more bookmarks, no more scene selection, just the bare minimum episode list thrown over the cover image and on our way we go.  Any idiot with the bare knowledge of DVD encoding could have come up with a better menu, but Lionsgate was obviously not going to spend the time and money having an employee do it.  Indeed, as many of us thought before the release, this is an afterthought release to placate us and hopefully make us go away.  They forget that if one is a Blu Ray buyer, one tends to understand quality and the difference between a good product and as shoddy one. I guarantee you all of you will once you get this season's Blu Ray release.

So, three stars because, ultimately, I am glad they did release it on Blu Ray after all, and because we HOPE they will grace us with the rest of the seasons on Blu Ray without having to beg too much. Should you buy this? Well, yes, of course, especially if you want to see Seasons 8 and 9 released on this format.  Should we be thrilled about this?  Probably not, as Lionsgate (like most studios today) has forgotten that it is the consumer that keeps them open.  But, keeping the customer happy is a trend gone as the Little House on the Prairie days.....",1438905600,24,2840,4.272897196261682
7357299,2,B012O29DR2,"No way am I going to watch this on DVD.  My money is going to stay in pocket after season 6.  I don't watch DVD.

OK, so now it's coming out on Blu-ray, I'm glad Lionsgate saw the error of their DVDish ways, but it's too late for me.  I'm finishing Season 7 right now as I write on DVD. I chose the older DVD release in order to not give Lionsgate any money and because there's no significant difference between a ""remastered"" DVD and an older DVD release.  They're both only watchable as a background activity while you're doing something else.  Like writing this review right now.  And how does Lionsgate expect anyone to understand the difference between an older DVD and a newer one when they can't even appreciate the difference between DVD and Blu-ray?

I have to say that Season 7 is the worst season of LHOP yet and I'm actually grateful that I didn't have to watch this with full attention on Blu-ray.  I don't think I would have been able to stand it. I still want to see what ""happens"" I guess, but I need to get other stuff done too. It's more appropriate as background garbage viewing.  Maybe Lionsgate realized this, that the later seasons of LHOP didn't deserve the same attention as the first ones.  It's not even the same show really, just an imitation with the same actors.  They were stretching it to go up to season 6 as it was.  There were a few passable episodes in that season and a lot of junk, but absolutely no gems. Season 7 is 100% mawkish garbage.  It rates 2 stars only because of the momentum of the series makes you determined to suffer through the whole thing. Two stars is my actual rating for this season, having nothing to do with the failure to put it out on Blu-ray.

Lionsgate: I am such a sucker that I will still buy season 8, 9 and the specials on Blu-ray if you get them out FAST!  Like, next week for Season 8! You already blew it on Season 7. The clock is ticking on this show and once I finish I'll never want to go back to Walnut Grove!",1438905600,48,1983,4.262032085561497
7357300,1,B012O29DR2,"IT'S 5 STARS FOR THE SERIES, BUT 1 STAR FOR THE DVD RELEASE. IT SHOULD BE RELEASED ON BLU RAY AS THE FIRST 6 SEASONS. THERE ARE MANY FANS WAITING FOR THIS RELEASE ON BLU RAY.",1438905600,18,174,3.861111111111111
7357301,2,B012O29DR2,"Original DVD Review:
After stringing faithful fans along for the first 6 seasons, Lionsgate has pulled the plug on Blu-Ray and Digital HD for the remaining 3 seasons of the series (and specials) and solely releasing this on standard def DVD?  Say it ain't so.  This is a great series, but a shame they're not planning on releasing the remaining seasons on Blu-Ray, particularly since they've already done the restoration work and have announced the complete series along with the specials (all digitally restored).

Updated Blu Ray Review:

I'm really on the fence with this new ""Blu-ray"" release.  Lionsgate is testing customers to see just how desparate they are and how much they (Lionsgate) can get away with.  Three things to note about the newly announced Blu-Ray release.

1) This is NOT a true Factory Blu-Ray set.  It's being made ""On Demand:"" and according to Amazon's listing it will be burned on DVD-R media.  It's not really clear exactly what this set will look like packaging, discs, and the in-bluray menus, etc...and how professional it will look, or if it will look like someone's pirate release made in a garage on someone's home PC.

2) As far as I can tell his release does NOT include the Digital HD copy that the other previous Blu Ray releases had.  It's Blu Ray only.  The Digital HD costs $20, separately, if you wanted both.

3) It's being sold for more than previous releases.  The price I paid for each of the previous 6 seasons was in the range of $17.50-$18.00.  With this release currently selling for $24.99 that's $7+ markup (an almost 39% markup).

So not only have they raised the price by almost 39% (which is apparently the reason they stopped producing the true factory Blu Ray sets after Season 6), but they have reduced what we're getting for that price in terms of overall content, and also in the quality of the whole production.  All while essentially taking no risk (since they are only manufacturing this ""On Demand"").  They really have gone out of their way to disrespect their fans.  I'm not expecting to be thrilled by this release at all.  I currently have this on pre-order, but am considering cancelling.  What message does this send to Lionsgate if fans accept such a meager and pathetic product.  Lionsgate will continue to offer this poor product if fans jump on it with open arms...

Update 2: I have received the Blu-ray offering.  Here are my observations:

Specs:
- This Blu ray release is (as previously stated) very underwhelming.  It is a bare bones release and Lionsgate has made as cheap of a product as they could (compared to previous releases).
- It would appear based on a cursory review of the video specs (per my BD player) that the video quality is similar in Mbps compression.
- The audio however is of lower quality than previous releases.  Previous releases were DTS-HD Master Audio (1.8Mbps).  The current audio is: Dolby Digital 2.0 (448 kbps).
- Menus are garbage.  They are low budget and look like what someone would produce on a home-made release.  Compared to previous releases they are poor.
- Discs themselves look (physically) like any other release.  Packaging is comparable to previous releases except there is no outer slipcase.

I was expecting an underwhelming release and got what was expected.  No Digital Copy.  Physical packaging is better, but presentation (on the actual Blu-ray) is much worse.

I will be returning my Blu-ray.  I'm not a happy camper.  I just bought the entire series on digital HD instead ($20 total, all seasons).  If Lionsgate doesn't want to make a respectable release, they've lost my future LHOTP purchases.  I give it 2 stars, since it's something.  But ""low budget"".  So it gets rated what it deserves.",1438819200,37,3723,4.809148264984227

Problems I have found:
1) English subtitles. On Disc 2 - Portrait of Love - the subtitles are of the Lost Ones episode. Also another episode has subtitles out of sync with the picture. Very annoying. I'm only at disc 2; subtitle issues may also appear on other episodes.  Do not know if this happens with the other languages.
2) A weird glitch with the menu popup. Here's how to reproduce:
  -Select POP UP/MENU from your remote(names may vary) while an episode is running (This is different from TOP MENU).
  -Then select 'Episodes' from the pink on-screen menu bar.
 The vertical episode list appears but can not navigate selector to list. Scrolling results in the white selector box moving to one of three 'phantom' places on the screen. Results of selecting each place: Selecting the left place takes you back to the episode. Selecting the middle place moves the white selector where it should be and allows you to now select episodes. Selecting the right place takes you the Language Setup.

By the time the actors speak, the closed captioned words have already flashed on the screen and are long gone.

I've contacted them again - same story, same result - nothing.
Amazon is once again amazing to us by offering a replacement, but I suspect the next one will be the same lack of quality from Lionsgate.

7357334,5,B012O29DR2,"I absolutely love this set. Season 7 menu does look different than the others and appears maybe to have been done by a different company. The menu is an ugly pink screen with just the names of the episodes. All prior Seasons contained animations of scenes from each episode as you scrolled through. I liked that. However it doesn't affect the actual episodes. I think this is an excellent value for the price. Thank you to whomever created these BluRays. Wonderful, top notch job in creating gorgeous picture. Definitely buy them if you're a Little House fan. You won't regret it, believe me.

7357345,1,B012O29DR2,I don't normally have a problem with these bluray but for some reason this season 7 on bluray feels very different from the other seasons. This bluray feels like a knock off. This does not come with bluray cover like the other one does and when I press next to attempt to skip the intro it goes past it and so I have to now fast forward. The overall quality of how the menu looks and the video quality feels like a cheap dvd rather than its previous Blu-ray Discs and this time for some reason there wasn't a code for vudu digital copy so now I'm missing a season on my library.,1469318400,,578,4.123893805309734

I wish there is some way that we can email Lionsgate and ask them if its possible to have it restored. It's just a thought. Lionsgate, I request that you restore the episode back to its original uncut format. With scenes of Charles buying the first pane of glass, and Harriet carrying on about Laura and Almanzo being separated and telling Nels how important it is to keep romance alive in a marriage, but with these scenes being left out, it makes the episode not uncut.

7357367,2,B012O29DR2,"I love the Little House series. I mean LOVE the series. Waited for the season 7 bluray and when it didn't get released, bought the DVD Deluxe Remastered. The quality doesn't even look like it was remastered. I'm reading the new blu-ray for season 7 doesn't look remastered either. So, why bother buying the bluray? One thing is whether it was remastered and another thing is whether it's a blu-ray. Why buy an improperly or poorly remastered bluray? The best release was season 1 remastered edition blu-ray. Even season 2 was great. But there started to be some quality issues here and there. Maybe they went through the remastering process too quickly? Season 7 is pretty bad in quality. The menu isn't even ""fun"" anymore like the others were. It's a great lesson for our children on how companies will decrease quality over time to make the same (or even more) money. The sound wasn't as good and neither was the picture...by a long shot. Season 8, I'd love to have on blu-ray, but who wants to pay $30 for a release that's of such lower quality than seasons 1-3",1455148800,3,1064,4.605263157894737

7357369,5,B012O29DR2,"First off, let me just say THANK YOU to Lionsgate for at least giving us a Blu-ray release of Season 7. I enjoyed it recently and found the quality to be pretty good on my 65"" Ultra, but not as good as Seasons 1-6. For a company, you have to look at the series in question and realize that this is a great TV show with many, many fans. We live in the Digital Age Era now. Do you hear us Lionsgate? DVDs are subpar format and were not made for High Definition TVs of ""today"".
So, it is only natural when you give us Seasons 1-6 on Blu-ray and then stop, look, and do an about face, you're not doing the fans of this show and format any justice. I really do hope in the near future, you listen to us fans and collector's and release 8 and 9 on Blu-ray format so we can complete the series in High Definition! Don't do 1-6 with high quality and then get cheap on us with the remaining 3.

Even with no slipcover, menus not as good as Seasons 1-6 on Blu-ray and sound Dolby Digital 2.0, I still give it the score for being on Blu-ray. The picture quality as a whole is better than that of DVD. Come on Lionsgate, get us Seasons 8 and 9 on Blu-ray format !!!",1454630400,6,5198,4.36918304033092

7357371,2,B012O29DR2,"I just purchased the Season 7 Blu-Ray disk at Double the price I paid for the Season 4-6 disks.  I would agree with the other reviewers that this Blu-Ray version is not up to par with the previous Blu-Ray versions.  I don't think the video quality is as good, and the disk menu system is basically just text, nothing like the previous versions.  As previous said, it is just patchwork by Lions Gate - why does it cost twice as much for a lower quality disk?  I had pre-ordered my Season 8 Blu-ray disk, but I just went and cancelled that order.  Not going to pay double again for this sub-standard work.  If they bring it back to the Season 6 quality, I might order it, but will wait for the reviews first.",1454457600,3,706,4.2706766917293235
7357372,5,B012O29DR2,"This is a review of the Blu-ray edition of Little House on the Prairie season 7. I can't imagine why Amazon lumps together reviews of all formats. This makes no sense and results in inaccurate reviews. The picture quality of season 7 on Blu-ray is excellent, consistent with seasons 1-6. The sound is Dolby Digital 48khz at 448kbps instead of the DTS Master Audio used on seasons 1-6. However I can't hear any difference. Audio quality is just fine. The menus have been redesigned and are just plain still backgrounds with the selections you need. I like them better since the discs load much faster and it is quicker to find the episode you want and start it. Overall very well done. I just hope that Lionsgate releases seasons 8 and 9 and the movies on Blu-ray. DVD is obsolete standard definition format that most collectors don't buy anymore.",1454112000,8,846,4.684563758389261

7357377,5,B012O29DR2,"With the low ratings the price dropped down to $10, so I bought it. It was worth that price for the updated complete episodes and in particular for the ultraviolet digital copy of every episode added to my collection. It's a shame that they didn't continue the great quality level of those Blu Ray versions of this classic, I would have paid the higher amount as I'm sure many fans would have. After season seven the show changed anyway with the kids growing older, but I would have bought all of the seasons in Blu Ray just to have the complete collection in that kind of high quality, and now I don't see that happening. I'm disappointed and I hate to say it but This is it, and I only got this one because of the price drop, which has gone back up some again since then. Update- well, they came out with a Blu Ray version so I updated my rating to a five star and I'm buying the Blu Ray today.

7357381,4,B012O29DR2,"I just wanted to post something for those on the fence about getting this as a Blu-Ray MOD.  I put in the discs as ran through them to check Picture and Audio quality.  My wife noticed a slight dip in audio quality, but as C Long says in his (much more detailed) review, it is not a lossless audio track like previous seasons.  The picture quality is clear (and again as C Long says in his review), on par with previous seasons.  I thought there might have been a slight dip here as well, but it's probably due to source materials.  I haven't sat through entire the previous seasons in their entirety like my wife and daughter.  My wife said Season 2 wasn't quite as clear as Season 1, so I'm willing to say there's no marked drop in PQ on this MOD release.  The picture is clear and has sufficient grain as to not have been DNR'd.

The Static menus didn't bother me, but not being able to skip the intro and start with the show (but rather a few frames/scenes into it) was a detractor (although a minor one).  Overall, I can say this is worth buying, in hopes that Lionsgate will continue to release the remaining seasons on Blu-ray.",1452297600,2,1134,4.311320754716981

As previously stated, there is no slipcover,  no Digital Version codes, the disc menus are not elaborate  (very basic), and the discs are pressed not ""burned"" as typical Made on Demand products are.

Lionsgate apparently had no plans for anything past Season 6 on the blu-ray format. Fans lobbied and this Amazon exclusive release was the result. There is a lot of cost-cutting in place here, necessary to get the item published on blu. This is a very bare-bones release in terms of packaging, menus and lack of extras.

This season is supposed to be complete and uncut, season 7 disc #2 Episode- Divorce Walnut Grove Style (45 min not the usual 48min) is indeed not in its complete uncut version, it does contain scenes that the imavision  set did not include but also omitted  scenes that the imavision set included. At about 7-8 min into DVD, The new set omits Charles getting first pane of  glass for the picture window from Nels at the Mercantile and substitutes it with another scene that was not in Imavisions set. 2nd after Harriet tells Nellie at the restaurant that Laura is leaving Almanzo, there is a scene (about 15 min into dvd) with Harriet getting ready for bed, carrying on to Nels about how they( Laura and Almanzo)  were bound to get seperated and how it is important to keep romance alive in a marriage. this scene is replaced in the new Lionsgate version with the other scenes that were originally cut out of imavision version. So in essence we have the Imavision set missing 2 scenes and the Lionsgate version missing 2
entirely different scenes, making neither complete or uncut. This was  disappointing since I had hoped to finally have the entire series uncut but of course we are still missing The Little House Years from Season six. It looks like no Company is ever going to get it 100%, and by the time they do we will have purchased the set many times over but the quality of this set is by far better than the previous set.",1447891200,5,1509,4.533088235294118

I say, this show isn't like All in the Family or other shows from the 70s and 80s that were recorded on videocassettes and are permanently available only in low quality. LHOTP was made like a movie with Panavision cameras and crisp, rich, lifeline colors and detail that shined on Blu-ray. Sure the DVD is passable, but so is VHS. It was pretty disappointing to move from season 6 to season 7 and suddenly have everything be white-ish, washed out, muddy and pixelated. Yes, we're in 2015 and we're going backwards. I realize it's all about the profit . . . but that only begs the question: Why charge less then $20 for a 5 disc Blu-ray set? What do they expect? No sense whatsoever.

7357412,5,B012O29DR2,"UPDATED REVIEW:
Thank you Lionsgate and Amazon for listening to paying customers and providing us a way to own HD copies and complete the Little House collections in modern HD resolution, not in 1990s resolution DVD. I was not going to re-buy the series in DVD and only in Blu-ray, as my family already had the original releases. I have updated my review from * to *****!

Original Review before Blu-ray was announced:
No Blu-Ray? We've been scammed by Lionsgate! If my family knew that the whole series would not be released on Blu-ray, I would not have purchased Season 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6. We have collected Seasons 1-6 to date because the uncut, high-def, uncompressed Blu-ray had magnificent audio and video quality! It looked and sounded as if it was filmed last year, not over four decades ago! We owned the original DVD releases, and while they were cut and of substandard quality, they would be more than sufficient for most people... until you add high-def AND uncut onto the mix. LionsGate, you pulled the rug out on your customers and it is really bad, dishonest and underhanded business practice. I'm actually pretty miffed, as is my entire family. Gone is the value in buying these things in HD if you can't collect them all.

And to those who wonder, ""What's the big deal? Just stream!"" - Ha! Do you believe it when politicians lie to you too? Firstly, data is expensive and in some areas it is not unlimited -- some areas have VERY limited bandwidth and it can be VERY expensive (more per month than a Blu-ray set costs, that's for sure). Secondly, subscriptions and/or one-time-use codes are needed to view. Without them, good luck. Thirdly, you don't own a hard copy of a stream. It can be here today and gone tomorrow with no apologies or excuses. If you own an uncompressed hard copy, nobody can take it from you and as long as you don't abuse it, you'll have it forever. I warn people of that who mock those that buy hard copies and then I ask them how it feels when subscription services take them away over contractual reasons or what not, or their hard drive crashes and the save ultra-violet copies or what not are gone forever.

Plain and simple: Release these on Blu-ray and I buy right away. Release them only on DVD and you lose a customer. For life.",1447200000,9,2278,4.537712895377129
7357413,5,B012O29DR2,"EDIT: It looks like this will be on blu-ray after all--definitely more expensive right now as a pre-order listing than their other current blu-rays but if this is the ONLY way to get it then we need to support this. I changed this review from a 1 star to a 5. Maybe this will help future seasons.

This is the worst decision ever, sadly it's not the first time it has happened. For example Bones first 9 Seasons were on both BR & DVD so of course I got the BR version. Now the show is in season 11 and its season 10 was only released on DVD & I don't see then changing their mind.

7357421,5,B012O29DR2,"**UPDATE** 12-14-2015
Due to the recent fact that Lionsgate is now offering season 7 on Bluray, I've pre-ordered and changed my review rating, with hopes that the season 7 bluray will indeed be released, as well as the rest of the series. We shall see...

** original review**
Hopefully Lionsgate will get the stats from Amazon, and they'll see that along with myself, many people probably pre-ordered every Bluray for the first 6 seasons.  And since they stopped releasing on Bluray, maybe they'll see a huge drop in both pre-orders and overall sales.

Like many others, I refuse to buy the rest of the series on SD format. I give credit to Lionsgate for remastering the series and including the original footage, etc., but to offer 3/4 of the series on Bluray and then all of a sudden stop... that's inexcusable, and it's terrible business practice.

Lionsgate has already bitten the bullet for 6 seasons, so why not finish it out? Why leave such an inexplicable hole in the production? If it's a matter of costs, I'm sure most, if not all, of the customers would gladly pay more for the Bluray versions. Heck, most fans probably paid $35-$40 for the crappy Imavision DVD releases of LHOTP years ago. So what's the reason for not finishing out the last few seasons on Bluray?

Anyhow, I pre-ordered and purchased the 1st 6 seasons on Bluray, and I'll gladly pre-order and buy all of the remaining seasons... IF they're released on Bluray.

If Lionsgate won't finish what they started with the Bluray releases, then they won't get my money. Simple as that.

Update 11-2-2015
To go even deeper, I truly expect Lionsgate to go even further overboard with this move. I have a sneaking suspicion that they stopped the Bluray releases just so that they can fleece the die hard customers/fans again later... when they release a whole new Little House Bluray Deluxe Box Set, containing all of the seasons.

I think they know perfectly well that if most of the fans already have all of the seasons on Bluray individually, they probably won't buy a complete box set later on. So what better way to force them into double dipping, and buying more products, than to cut off their individual season collections short, and leave us all unsatisfied. They'll just make up some excuse later that it wasn't cost effective for them to keep producing the single seasons on Bluray, or something like that.

So be prepared, and get your wallets ready... we may just see a Little House on the Prairie, Complete Series Deluxe Box Set ON BLURAY, for something like $129.00 - $149.00, sometime in the near future. (of course that will be on top of the $100 - $120 bucks many of us already paid for the 1st 6 seasons on Bluray)",1445731200,7,2702,4.6835443037974684

I refuse to support a company who would do this to their customers. I would return the first 6 seasons if I could, because my set will now be incomplete!

Gaining a following who were waiting anxiously for each release to complete their set, and now will not be able to is not the way to treat your customers! What an inconsiderate thing to do to us huge Little House fans!. Raise the price if you must! I would pay more than what they were initially being sold for to complete my set and be able to actually own them. I would like to request that you also release the following 3 movies after season 9 on Blu-ray: 'Bless All The Dear Children', 'Look Back To Yesterday' & 'The Last Farewell' and the Little House years Special. The fans want them, why would you not want to please your customers? If its all about money, then raise the price, WE WANT OUR SETS COMPLETED!! This show means too much to too many people for you make promises you refuse to keep. To hook us and then dupe us.

I orginally owned the entire series on DVD after spending almost $300 for it. Then I sold my original series set, losing $150 thinking that I could get all of these on Blu Ray. We are in the century where Blu Ray dominates over DVD and every single thing is being released on Blu Ray. Even old movies like The Sound of Music and South Pacific were released on Blu Ray.

7357451,5,B012O29DR2,"Update 31/12 can't believe it this set is actually multi region why they didn't make them all multi region?  Would've increased sales luckily I have a region a player for the others but very impressed on first looks as I got home after getting my text message saying it had been delivered

Can't wait for eight and nine with the films on I presume just as with dvd

But hey I don't care  if they want to maximise there money and make a show rate film blu ray with the last three on it it will be worth it
Someone reviewing this said theres no scene selection just looked while in an episode and each breaks into about twelve scenes

Can't understand people giving this blu ray less points for no extras and digital copy mines at Heathrow airport so hopefully will see in few days
Firstly extras well as here aren't any on series 7 dvd release so probably wasn't ever going to be any on blu ray release them digital copy well wasn't it blu ray we asked for?  Those if us outside USA can't use digital copy anyway and frankly I always even in UK releases digital code goes on the bin not worth it we wanted blu ray and that's what we got it will look the same as the dvd in terms of picture quality as the dvd were also remastered and yes some people for nd differences many didn't what I wanted was continuance of casing and not the large wide dvd cases thry had used on dvd which were sub standard I had to replace them nice 14 mm blu ray case great looks better in my boxes but digital copy not on the to save money well tough luck lionsgate run a business fine to put price up for it bring blu ray but would've put many off if another ten dollars added to give you the impression that's it's free larger film studios can take the costs of free digital lionsgate clearly have found thry lose out from it or gave done on this series you want it digital simple buy it again digital

Wow stock in early mines just been shipped will take about twelve days usually to UK well maximum most stuff only 7 days also it came down in price and final. Uk conversion was 28 well worth it up 10 on previous releases but gladly accept that and that's with import and shipping

Glad I preordered this everyone get on it now more series 7 sold the higher the rest will be on blu ray

Update 6/12/15 European date format that is

Put the date that way as this is in addition to c longs excellent information
Not only have amazon got this exclusive deal with lionsgate they are shipping to UK can't confirm other parts of Europe but try and pre order and see what happens like even with conversion about 45 but let's face it those other series were priced oddly low compared to say other series from USA in blu ray for example bbc 11 hours of four miss Marple episodes cost 38 but little house was costing me 18-23 no wonder lionsgate lost out so European and USA fans get your money out and get on pre order now so that amazon know what kind of response they'll get

As a UK viewer most disappointed the dvd versions remastered are good not a problem but when I got my region a player that only cost me 60 including taxes post and packing from USA I decided hey why not now finish the collection on blu ray I had got to season four on dvd so I said when I can afford it try and get a blu ray version from USA  one every month.
I did that and caught up so was ready for season six and this time pre ordered to now find season seven only dvd I store my dvd and blu ray separately so now I'm going to have to put all seasons together with blu and dvd same storage case ok not a major problem just annoying
What is a major problem and ira happened so many tines with companies starting releases and then bailing out I suppose at least be thankful they said they release seven in dvd I'm worried about eight and nine and the films are thry going to release separate or exoect us to buy the box set?  No way on that unless lions gate let us send  the blu ray back and discount us on box set
So sorry lions gate another company that's let me down on dvds and blu rays I will get seven on dvd bur just wait till it ends up at a bargain price

The good news is I've just looked at both the lions gate dvd of an episode still of series four on my TV and the scene I looked at I changed TV settings to zoom in and out etc and in fact both blu ray and dvd were identical my dvd being upscale with hdmi connection I then put dvd in my TV dvd combo expected it as with most dvd to be lower quality on there to my surprise it was equal to blu ray as well remember these only so far you can go with blu ray of old TV shows films stand a higher chance",1442793600,10,4617,4.041621029572837

7357453,4,B012O29DR2,"**UPDATE 1/26/2016**
Last week I decided to see if anything had changed about Little House on BD, and sure enough it had!  Now, I hadn't caught the reports that hit the internet that LionsGate was doing this - so big shock and amazement followed.  Another person did an awesome review / write up on the situation with the new Blu-Ray releases - most likely the ""top recommended"" review, I'd suggest you read it :)

Summary:  Overall I'm happy and content with the tradeoffs that were done in order to make the final 3 season releases possible.  *I hope season 9 still happens, that one may still be up in the air.

Here are the caveats:
1) These will be Amazon Exclusives  (yea, I have no heartache over that at all; if it cuts costs then do it)

2) No slip cover  (these will forever mark, in my collection and mind, the battle with LionsGate where the fans and the company reached a middle ground on the product - so I've made peace with the fact they'll look different on my shelf when next to the rest)

3) No fancy menus like in the previous seasons BDs - they are static and basic but get the job done just fine (they're not pretty, but they do their job and are functional)

4) As far as I can tell (I'm only 4 episodes in) the video quality is about the same as the previous releases; maybe I'm being picky, but there are definitely some things that make me wonder how true of a statement that is.....honestly, I can't complain because it's only in spots, and previous seasons had their ""spots of iffy quality"" as well. **Admit it, previous seasons *were not* perfect.

5) Audio quality / bitrate - people have commented ""lower bitrate on audio"" ...ya know what?  It still sounds damn good!  I've also noticed that I don't have to toggle the volume up and down as often as I did with previous seasons - quit whining, the bitrate is still high.

6) Prices will probably be a bit more than previous seasons (guess what...LionsGate wasn't making enough money off the previous BD releases to warrant further releases, so if it's an extra few bucks to get the last 3 seasons, I think we can live with that)

Anyway...  After reading that amazingly detailed review that I mentioned above, I bought season 7 and pre-ordered 8 both on BD.  I did not look closely, but the discs do not appear to be burned media - which I believe that ace review reported as well (real BDs); if they are burned media, then huzzah!!  They look damn good :)

Changing rating from 1 star to 4 (why not 5? .... why 5? .... Had it been without the compromises / caveats , then I probably would have rated it a 5.  Consider my rating as of now a 4 - 4.5 , I'm extremely grateful to even have these on BD media in a great quality, so trust me, I'm not snubbing anything...just being realistic / fair - I'm not disappointed at the caveats enough to take more than 1 star because of them.  Besides, 5 star reviews are not something I EVER do, unless I'm simply floored) ;o)

-----------------------------------------
OLD / Original Review from last fall (2015) (leaving for posterity sake - and to make sense of the comments my review garnished)...

My Disclaimer: I hate the kind of review I'm going to write, because it's not helpful to future customers looking for this show on DVD, but it needs to be said (repeatedly) - hopefully someone will eventually take notice.

The show has been fantastic (especially the quality, etc..) on BLU-RAY.  However, at this point in time (9/14/2015) like so many others have said, Lionsgate is being very uncool to the loyal ""Little House fans"" that have been purchasing (and pre-ordering) every season on Blu-Ray, by not putting out the final 3 season on Blu-Ray.  If the problem is ""not making enough money on them"" - I'd imagine at $15-$18 a season (on Blu-Ray) wouldn't be helping much; so jack the price up a bit.  It was a great move to get people interested and stay hooked (i won't lie, it helped me get into the first 2 seasons), but with 3 seasons remaining?  Screw it, put the price up to $30-$40 a pop - I would gladly pay that to finish off the collection.

But there's no way I will suddenly buy the remaining 3 seasons on DVD after having the first 6 on Blu-Ray - or even buy the complete series on DVD (in a house box design no less??) - that's just ludicrous!",1442188800,17,4288,4.418575063613232

Also, It is truly heartbreaking to learn that Lionsgate has no plans to issue the remaining seasons of Little House on the Prairie in Blu-Ray format. Those of us who have already purchased seasons one through seven in Blu-Ray will not have the opportunity to complete our collection. Why would Lionsgate do this to their loyal consumers and Little House fans? I will never again begin a TV series multiple season collection if it is produced by Lionsgate.

UPDATE: Lionsgate has my appreciation.  Now available on Blu Ray--and, as per my request, costing me more than the other Blu Ray remasters so far.  Guess I should have demanded it be as cheap as before, too.  But, I have pre-ordered this on Blu Ray, and that is something I was unable to do several months ago.  I guess someone at Lionsgate actually reads these reviews and gives a crap about customers.  I am dumb-founded, but pleasantly so.  And, now a Lionsgate lover instead of a hater!!

By the way, can anyone confirm for sure--and it appears this is the case--that neither the DVD nor Blu Ray release of Season 7 has no extras at all.  That they're both just the episodes and that's it?

 those people want to see an old series in blu format  ?
 As sales have shown in general blu ray format FAILED TO BEAT dvd format all those years and dvd sales are keep going strong.
 reason is the picture is not so much better in blu except on few occasions and it's even worsat in some cases.
 apart from that if we exlude a few sci-fi - fantasy films like avatar, star wars.....etc.....in which blu ray worth the money in most cases is a waste of time that's why sales were not what companies expected.

 DVD still rules and myself i alweays buy dvd and in rare occasions a blu ray.
 really those negative comments......come from WHICH PLANET  ?

7357475,5,B012O29DR2,"Update:  28 January 2016

Finally!  It's Season 7 on blu-ray at last!  Well, most of us fans thought that it was never going to happen, but here it is!  Lionsgate caved and put out ""Little House on the Prairie"" Season 7 on blu-ray as a MOD (Manufactured on Demand) title.  Amazon currently lists this as being presented on DVD-R (DVD Recordable Discs), which is simply not the case.  In fact, these discs are not even BD-R (Blu-Ray Recordable) discs.  They are factory pressed blu-ray discs, like the previous 6 seasons on blu-ray.  I was one of many fans who originally, out of spite, gave Season 7 a 1-star review, hoping to catch the attention of Lionsgate.  Whatever the case, Lionsgate reacted, and now we have it on blu-ray!

So, what are the results?  First of all, as other reviews have pointed out, we are missing a number of things on Season 7 which were present on the previous 6 blu-ray sets, including a slipcover, a free HD digital download code, and lossless audio.  Additionally, the elaborate menus on the previous season sets are nowhere to be seen.  Lionsgate has presented this blu-ray edition with a generic menu, using the cover art and episode titles instead.  It's not a bad menu at all, but it is lacking in comparison to the menus of the previous seasons.  Regardless, I didn't buy the season for the menus.  Along with the content, I bought it for the upgrade in video and audio quality over the previous DVD releases.  While I admit that the slipcover is nice on the previous sets, it is not essential for me.

I never used the HD digital download code on any of the previous 6 blu-ray seasons.  I wanted a physical copy for a reason, but I understand why some fans would like to stream the show digitally in HD, too.  The digital download code is simply a nice bonus to those individuals buying it on a physical format, but the lack of one here is no reason for me to get mad.

As for the audio, the set is presented in Dolby Digital 2.0 at 448 kbps, whereas the previous 6 seasons on blu-ray featured DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0.  If I were to downgrade the rating of the set for any reason, the lack of lossless audio would be the main reason.  However, I think that the soundtrack sounds just fine at 448 kbps.  In fact, I cannot tell the difference.  That's not to say that a difference cannot be heard by other reviewers.  I just don't hear it.  Why the downgrade from DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0 to regular Dolby Digital 2.0?  Apparently, it was licensing fees.  Considering that the original series audio is mono, the 448 kbps soundtrack works just fine, in my opinion.

I've read a number of mixed reviews on the video quality.  Initially, some viewers reported that the video was downgraded as well, and some of them still claim this to be true.  I will admit that I did not test the bitrates among the previous seasons in order to confirm but used my eyes instead.  Upon viewing, I will admit that the first two episodes of Season 7 are more grainy and darker than normal, leading me to think that the reviews were true.  However, upon watching one episode after another, this grain and darkness is not recurrent at all!  Fans of the show will notice that a number of episodes in the previous seasons varied in quality -- scenes with heavy grain, darkness, lines, and blurred picture.

As I've watched one episode after another in Season 7, I've realized that, overall, the picture quality is just as good as the previous 6 seasons on blu-ray.  In fact, I was shocked at how beautiful the season looked on blu-ray as a whole, especially after reading some of the reviews.  One episode that I watched recently, ""To See the Light - Part 1"" looked so beautiful and so vibrant!  These episodes look just as good as any of the episodes on the previous 6 seasons, in my opinion.  They look beautiful, bright, and sharp, for the most part, with varying degrees throughout the episodes and the season.  Any video imperfections are most likely the result of the original masters and how they were originally filmed.

I really wanted to give Season 7 on blu-ray a 4-star review due to the downgrade in audio and the out of sync subtitles.  However, I don't use the subtitles, so I haven't even bothered to check the issues.  Apparently, the Spanish/French subtitles are out of sync on a number of episodes.  Again, this issue may warrant a negative review for those fans who use subtitles, and I imagine that those individuals will rate their reviews accordingly.  Overall, I am more than pleased with Season 7 on blu-ray.  Simply put, the show has never looked and sounded better!  For that reason, I cannot rate it lower than 5 stars.",1439251200,,4657,4.553012048192771

Lionsgate should have the decency to release the complete series on Bluray!
I haven't bought any season, waiting for a complete box-set (I had a hunch something like this would happen)
Now, I'm not going to buy the first 6 seasons on Bluray either, because I don't like having incomplete series in a format!",1439164800,16,348,4.5396825396825395
7357477,5,B012O29DR2,"I have been pre-ordering and receiving each season of Little House on the Prairie on Blu-Ray.  Lionsgate originally announced that all 9 seasons would be released on Blu-Ray, which is why I started buying them.  Now, with 3 seasons left to go, Lionsgate has cancelled any further Blu_Ray releases.  This is unacceptable.  I am an avid collector of films and am a royal Lionsgate customer.  However, I will not purchase another Lionsgate release until they have released Little House on the Prairie Seasons 7-9 on Blu-Ray.

Update:  Lionsgate has heard our cries.  They will soon be releasing Season 7 on Blu-Ray.  Thank you Lionsgate.  You've won my business back.",1439164800,19,664,5.009174311926605
7357478,5,B012O29DR2,"UPDATE 12/6/15: Lionsgate have announced S7 to be released on Blu-ray as an exclusive Amazon Manufacture-on-Demand title. It has a separate Amazon page (not this one) at http://www.amazon.com/Little-House-o.../dp/B018WIHN2O If you previously posted a low-star review here for the DVD, please change it as those reviews also affect the Blu-ray ranking, and then show your support for Blu-ray by purchasing this S7 set!

Lionsgate is only offering this release in the DVD format.  The masters have been completed for a Blu-Ray release but Lionsgate is trying to force customers to a streaming service, where Lionsgate can control your access to the content vs. customer control of content.  Do NOT support Lionsgate by purchasing this release.  Tell Lionsgate that there is a market for HD in the home, that is NOT through a streaming service.",1439164800,19,841,5.3007518796992485

7357480,1,B012O29DR2,"I do not know what to say. The fact that Lionsgate is releasing Seasons 7-9 on DVD only is ludicrous, especially that many of us bought 1-6 on Blu-Ray. I was happy when they released this show on Blu-Ray. It was convenient and digitally mastered beautifully. Plus the digital files made it all worthwhile. I like to maintain consistency with my TV collections. Hopefully, Lionsgate will reconsider this poor marketing move.",1439164800,52,423,4.971830985915493

8726348,2,B012O29DR2,"I'm currently on disc 2 (BR release) and I can confirm the English subtitles for the first episode on disc 2 are not for that actual episode. I read about this issue so I had no problem skipping it and moving on to the next episode - Divorce, Walnut Grove Style.

The problem is, I cant watch that episode either because my Blu-ray player seems to be having playback issues. I.E. Constantly freezing. This freezing occurs around the 3 minute mark when Laura is grading homework and Almanzo is getting his soup. PowerDVD will hang and the only way to end the software is by closing it via Task Manager. Its a nuisance.

Disc 1 has a butt load of subtitles out-of-sync. I've not yet checked out the other discs but Im assuming the whole set will have the subtitle problems. le sighs.",1515542400,,781,4.454545454545454
