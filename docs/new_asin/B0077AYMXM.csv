5060012,3,B0077AYMXM,"This wrestlemania was really awesome! Here's what you get.

Lillian Garcia is back once again in WWE and she sings ""America the Beautiful"" better than anybody I've ever seen!

Daniel Bryan vs. Sheamus - World Title - This match was only 18 seconds, I was hoping that we would get a decent match out of these two, espescially since we didn't get much of one between these two at WM 27, but for better or worse Wrestlemania 28 starts with a bang! 1/5

Kane vs. Randy Orton - This match was not bad but nothing special, this match could easily happen on Smackdown and it would be a good match, but for WM it's nothing special 2/5

Cody Rhodes vs. Big Show - Intercontinental Title - There are a few good spots in this match from Cody Rhodes but it's nothing special either. Big Show wins 2/5

Beth Phoenix/Eve vs. Kelly Kelly/Maria Monenus - Divas Tag Match - They say on commentary that Maria actually had 2 cracked ribs and her foot was messed up from dancing with the stars, in that case she did a lot despite the injuries. This match is like the diva matches we've had over the last year, meh, but this match was definetly better than I expected. Double stinkface!!! 2/5

Triple H vs. Undertaker - Hell in a Cell - Now Wrestlemania picks up, and picks up big! This match was absolutely awesome, much better than the No Holds Barred Battle last year and we get to see a little blood! OMFG! But this match was very violent with chair shorts definetly in the double digits, this match was great and is worth the price of the dvd/blu-ray. 5/5

Team Teddy vs. Team Johnny - This match was an out of control demolition derby at times, which is exactly what I wanted, along with having some time for some great in-ring time. I would have liked to see this match go a little longer, but they get a lot out of this match. 3/5

CM Punk vs. Chris Jericho - WWE Title - This was the match I really wanted to see and this match was the best of the night in my opinion. It was a great WERESTLING match and these two matched up counter-for-counter and so forth. Fantastic match! 5/5

I laughed so hard when Brodus Clay comes out in a big dance number with a bunch of mommas!!!

John Cena vs. Rock - This was the match I expected, Cena finisher here, Rock finisher here, kick out, kick out, Rock Bottom, win. This match wasn't the best on the card but was definetly worth watching. 3/5",1333238400,3,2370,4.30561797752809
5060013,5,B0077AYMXM,All the matches were great. i enjoyed the hell in a cell match the best. it was the 2nd time in history an inanimate object got its own theme music( that being the cell and the barber shop chair at wm 23) alot of chair shots great 30 min match. one question why did cena have to parody the boston celtics with his new shirt.  THE 28TH INSTALLMENT OF WRESTLEMANIA IS ONE OF THE BEST EVER. thank you vince for making another four hours fly by,1333238400,,440,4.116279069767442
5060014,4,B0077AYMXM,"The set up for this WM was awesome. The stage was one of the best they've ever done. The pyro was the best since WM24. And the match card was one of the best in a long time.

The best matches are as expected: HHH vs Undertaker stole the show but was too early in the night. Because of this, it took away all excitement for the following matches, including Rock/Cena (which is still a great match with a surprise ending). The other matches worth watching are Orton/Kane and Jericho/Punk. Orton/Kane needed more time, but I personally think it was a good match with a pretty good ending. Jericho/Punk has a good build up and a good delivery - not disappointed, but not overly impressed. Fortunately there are not matches like Lawler/Cole or Bret Hart/Vince McMahon - nothing is a complete waste of time, however the first match (Bryan/Sheamus) is really short.

Overall, this is a very good WM. I give it a strong 7.5 out of 10.",1333238400,2,926,4.505952380952381
5060015,5,B0077AYMXM,"The Worlds Title match between Daniel Bryan & Sheamus was a 18 second stinkfest. The Kane-Randy Orton match was a solid brawl with a top rope chokeslam(from Kane) to boot. The IC title match between Cody Rhodes & The Big Show was not great but pretty good. The Divas tag team match between The team of Kelly Kelly & Maria Menounos and the Team of Beth Phoenix & Eve was ok in terms of wrestling even with Maria's injuries holding the match by just a little bit. The Hell In The Cell Match between HHH & The Undertaker was a hardcore,smash-mouth & first-rate emotional brawl and HBK played part of the guest ref caught in the middle between pals very well. The 12 man tag team between Team Johnny & Team Teddy had its moments and got really intense in the end. The WWE title match between CM Punk & Chris Jericho was a hard-hitting,back-and-forth,intense bout. The bout between The Rock & John Cena was a entertaining,power-driven,nail-biting match. I give this PPV a 9 out of 10.",1333238400,5,979,4.536723163841808
5060016,3,B0077AYMXM,"When i saw that The Rock and John Cena were gonna wrestle each other this year at Wrestlemania i KNEW immediately that i was gonna order this show. The major downside with this year's Wrestlemania is that many of the matches on the card this year with the exceptions of Rock vs Cena and Taker VS Triple H were all given very weak build-up's which means that outside of the main events, Many of the matches on this Wrestlemania didn't really seem to matter at all going into the show. Coming from the Sun Life Stadium, This Wrestlemania was done outside [like Wrestlemania 9 and 24] which means that the atmosphere was a little different than usual at Wrestlemania.

Match-by-match review:

1. For The World Heavyweight Champion
Champion Daniel Bryan VS Sheamus
Continuing the strange new trend of putting the Royal Rumble winner's world title match in the beginning of Wrestlemania, Sheamus essentially has a VERY quick match against Daniel Bryan no lie, this is all that happened: Bryan goes to kiss his girlfriend, turns around, then gets the brogue kick and is counted down and loses the world championship. A VERY pointless opener that doesn't even last a minute. No wonder why the Royal Rumble is beginning to become more and more pointless every year. Sheamus becomes the new world heavyweight champion No stars

2. Randy Orton VS Kane
Well, at least we got a longer match this time around. The feud going into this match was pretty weak so this match didn't really feel like that big of a deal. The match was pretty average but it was nice to see Kane pick up the win in the end with a nice top-rope chokeslam. ***

3. For the WWE Intercontinental Championship
Champion Cody Rhodes VS The Big Show
While i am glad to see the Intercontinental title get a now-rare defense at Wrestlemania, this match wasn't really that good. Although containing a few good spots from Cody, This match was painfully average and dull. Big Show becomes the new Intercontinental Champion. **1/2

4. Beth Phoenix & Eve VS Kelly Kelly & Maria Menounos
It's sad that WWE has been inviting celebrities in recent years to come to Wrestlemania to participate in matches [only 1 of which turned out to be a worthwhile venture]. Although this is not as bad as most divas matches, This definitely wasn't a match worthy of being included at Wrestlemania. I'll give the match a little extra credit for its cool ending though. Kelly & Maria won **1/2

5. Hell In A Cell Match
The Undertaker VS Triple H
Special guest referee: Shawn Michaels
In what is the third time these two men have competed against each other at Wrestlemania, This match had a VERY suspenseful factor added to it weeks before the match happened: Shawn Michaels as the special guest referee [The man who Undertaker retired at Wrestlemania 26]. After a boring first hour, we FINALLY get the first Wrestlemania-worthy match of the night! With the crowd alive for the first time of the night, Taker and Triple H deliver an awesome VERY suspenseful match that far surpasses both of their other matches at Wrestlemania. Several times throughout, Triple H had Taker seemingly defeated only to see Taker kick out of some VERY intense moves [Including a Sweet Chin Music from Shawn AND a Pedigree from Triple H!]. Despite the lack of blood, This was easily the finest Hell In A Cell match in a long time as it was brutal and very violent not to mention VERY emotional [especially in the ending moments]. In his 20th victory and in the absolute best match at this Wrestlemania, Undertaker defeats Triple H in a CLASSIC match that MUST be seen!! ***** [Best match of the night!!!

6. 12 Man Tag Match to determine who will gain the General Manager position to both Raw and Smackdown
Team Johnny [David Otunga, Jack Swagger, Drew Mcintyre, Dolph Ziggler, Mark Henry, and The Miz] VS Team Teddy [Santino Marella, Booker T, R-Truth, The Great Khali, Kofi Kingston, and Zack Ryder]
I guess this was a way of allowing the crowd to calm down after the EPIC match that previously happened. It was a pretty fun match that featured some good spots [like the one where Kofi, Zack, and R-Truth all did somersaults outside of the ring at the same time knocking out many of Team Johnny's members]. Unfortunately, Team Johnny wins when The Miz hit a Skull Crushing Finale on Zack Ryder while he was distracted by Eve allowing John Laurinitis to become the unanimous General Manager of both Raw and Smackdown. ****

7. For The WWE World Heavyweight Championship
Champion CM Punk VS Chris Jericho
Shortly before the match happened, John Laurinitis threatened that CM Punk would lose his World Title if he gets disqualified for any reason. Aside from some dull moments at times, This match was pretty good although this feud suffered from a weak build-up [like most matches on this show did]. There was some good submission wrestling from both Jericho and Punk and the crowd was pretty into it at times [especially near the end of it]. Although i was really hoping Jericho would win, Jericho would ultimately fall prey to CM Punk's Anaconda Vice in the end. Punk retains his title by submission. ****

8. The Rock VS John Cena
For over a year, This feud went on in the form of many insults and encounters between John Cena and The Rock. At Wrestlemania 27 last year, The Rock, who was the host of last year's event, Would interfere in Cena's world title match against The Miz which would make Cena furious and it would ultimately lead to Cena challenging The Rock the next night on Raw. For months afterward, Cena and Rock would randomly confront each other on Raw trading off insults to each other but surprisingly, Rock and Cena would find themselves actually teaming up with each other to face The Miz and R-Truth at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WWE-Survivor-Series-2011/dp/B005M9VSJ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WWE: Survivor Series 2011</a>&nbsp;in what was dubbed a ''Never before, Never again'' event. After that, The feud re-ignited last month when The Rock and John Cena would again begin trading insults at each other leading to some pretty classic moments on Raw [Did you see The Rock Concert or Cena's diss rap to The Rock?]. In what was without question the MOST hyped Wrestlemania match since Rock/Hogan at Wrestlemania 18, The Rock and John Cena delivered what was a pretty entertaining match that mostly lived up to its hype [although it was NOT the best match of the night!]. Plenty of crowd participation in this match [including **** you Cena chants during the match that will probably be edited out of the DVD and Blu-Ray] definitely made this match even better than what it was and while it wasn't good enough to be considered a 5 star match, It was a more than fitting way to end the show. The Rock wins the match when he suddenly catches Cena with a Rock Bottom. ****1/2

In the end, There was one classic 5-star match that came out of Wrestlemania tonight and it was NOT Rock vs Cena [despite all the promotion and all of the build-up that went into this match]. Unfortunately this event was brought down by a few too many average matches in the undercard that had little build-up [Daniel Bryan deserved a MUCH longer match than what he was allowed to have at this event] but if you remove the first 4 or so matches, This is easily the greatest Wrestlemania since 24 and another good thing is that the crowd was the most alive it's been for a Wrestlemania in a while so the show was definitely not a waste. The Hall Of Fame class was dissapointing yet again for the forth straight year [Why wasn't the Macho Man inducted this year????? WTF???] but thankfully their segment was kept pretty short and another good thing is that there was a little less talking on this year's Wrestlemania [If you saw Wrestlemania 27 you quickly noticed that there was a LOT of talking]. While this won't go down as the greatest Wrestlemania this show deserves to be seen for its entertaining second half which contains no bad matches at all. If you didn't see the show tonight, Don't pay the 55 dollars for the replay, Wait for the DVD [or Blu-Ray, whichever one you prefer] as you simply must see Taker/Triple H. WWE fans will find something to enjoy at Wrestlemania 28",1333238400,,8236,4.749126484975542
5060017,5,B0077AYMXM,"A year of build-up finally comes to a head when The Rock and John Cena finally face off in Rock's hometown of Miami. Can CM Punk channel his rage and turn back the challenge of Chris Jericho? Will the Royal Rumble winner Sheamus dethrone the World Champion Daniel Bryan? Its time for Wrestlemania 28, the showcase of the immortals.

-We open with the singing of America The Beautiful by Lillian Garcia, who has a pretty good voice and amps the crowd big time.

-World Heavyweight Championship Match, Daniel Bryan (Champion) w/AJ vs. Sheamus: For the second year in a row the World Title opens up Wrestlemania, but unlike last year this one ends in record time with the bell ringing then Sheamus hitting the Brogue Kick and covering to win the title in maybe 18 seconds. 2/10, simply for the shock factor. Sheamus celebrates as Bryan and AJ look on stunned. Side Note: Sheamus blended in with the white sandy beach like stage.

-Team Johnny are backstage talking about their strategy for tonights 12 man tag match, Laurenitis comes in and say this team has a chance to become a part of Wrestlemania history if they win tonight.

-Randy Orton vs. Kane: This would've been the cool down match had the world title match been an actual match. Its not a bad contest, but sort of underwhelming as the pace never gets out of first gear. Orton tries hitting his usual moves, but Kane just wears him down with sleeper holds and just beat him up. Randy makes his comeback goes for the RKO but Kane keeps countering and ends up hitting a huge chokeslam off the top and covers to win. 5/10, for the finish.

-Some lame segment with Mick Foley, Santino and a guy from the show ""Deadliest Catch"" getting ready to eat crab legs, but they just go crazy and it ends with Ron Simmons appearing behind them and he does his famous catchphrase to a huge reaction.

-WWE Intercontinental Championship, Cody Rhodes (Champion) vs. The Big Show: Cody had taunted Show for weeks about choking at Wrestlemaina's in the past so this was all about whether Show could win on the grandest stage of them all. Show dominated early chopping Rhodes down, however Cody was able to knock down the big man and ground him for a few. Show came back hitting a huge spear then the Knockout Punch and covers to win the I.C. title. 6/10, Show holds the title and starts crying for having his Wrestlemania moment.

-Diva's Tag Team Match, Eve & Beth Phoenix vs. Kelly Kelly & Maria Menounos: Spurring off a staged confrontation on TV's Extra a couple of weeks prior we have this match. Kelly hits some moves on Eve then tags Maria who soon after gets dominated by both Beth and Eve. Kelly gets the tag and takes it to both, gets locked into the Glam Slam but counters into a facebuster and tags Maria. Beth goes to press slam Maria, Kelly pulls her down, they shove Beth into Eve and Maria rolls up Beth for the win. 3/10.

-Matt Striker is backstage with Shawn Michaels who says this match will be the true end of an era.

-Jim Ross is introduced to call the Hell In A Cell Match.

-Hell In A Cell End of an Era Match, Triple H vs. The Undertaker, w/Special Guest Referee, Shawn Michaels: After last year's clash that left both men beaten down, Taker to the point that he couldn't leave under his own power, we have this match in the ultimate proving ground, Hell In A Cell. Loved the entrances by both men, Taker's jacket looked awesome and his entrance take forever like it usually does and he displayed a new shaven head. They start punching out each other, Taker hammers Trips on the outside slamming him into the cage wall a few times.

The fight continues in and out of the ring and Taker keeps up the offense, hitting his trademark leg drop on the ring apron crushing Trips throat. He comes back hitting the spinebuster onto the steel steps, but Taker goes for Hells Gate, Trips pulls him up and slams him down but only for two. Once the chairs and weapons are brought into play it gets hardcore as Trips crushes Taker with a chair numerous times, it reaches a point where Michaels says he should just cover him.

Taker does rise to his feet but gets knocked down again, Trips brings out the sledgehammer and argues with Shawn saying he will end this. Trips goes for the hammer blow but Shawn prevents it and throws it out the ring, Shawn goes to ring the bell but stops himself which angers Trips and causes Taker to lock Hells Gate on Michaels. Taker then locks on Hells Gate on Trips but Shawn is down and can't make the count. Charles Robinson comes down to make the count after a chokeslam but only for two, then Charles gets the chokeslam.

Shawn hits Sweet Chin Music on Taker, then the pedigdree but only for two, Trips throws Michaels out of the ring and Taker sits back up and takes it to Trips hitting the Tombstone but only for two. Both men trade blows as Shawn looks on torn about what he must do, we have another pedigree but again just a two count. Taker grabs the chair and returns the favor from earlier slamming it into Trips over and over, but just gets a two count, Taker hits a sledgehammer shot then the tombstone and covers for three. 11/10. Wow, just wow.

-We have highlights of the WWE Hall of Fame induction, then they are introduced live to the crowd with Edge getting the biggest pop out of all of them.

-There's some goofy segment with Heath Slater trying to get in on being a part of Flo Rida's performance, which ends with Rida pushing Slater into the wall and leaving.

-Team Johnny, Captain David Otunga, Drew McIntyre, Jack Swagger, Dolph Ziggler, Mark Henry & The Miz w/Vickie Guerrero & John Laurenitis vs. Team Teddy, Captain Santino Marella, Kofi Kingston, Great Khali, R-Truth, Zack Ryder & Booker T w/Hornswoggle & Teddy Long: We have this clustered match where the winning team will win control of both shows for either Laurenitis or Teddy. It starts with Kofi and Dolph, when Khali is tagged the crowd boos, Swagger takes it to Booker some hitting a big clothesline then tags in Mark Henry.

Miz gets the tag soon after and beats up Booker locking on a sleeper hold and Booker gets beaten down for a few minutes. The match breaks down with each guy getting a shot in, including a double flapjack on Khali by Drew and Jack, the best spot saw Truth, Kofi and Ryder. Santino gets the tag, hits the Cobra but the count is broken up by Ziggler, then Ryder hits the Ruff Ryder on Dolph, goes to hit Miz with the big boot but Eve accidentaly distracts the ref so Miz hits the Skull Crushing Finale and covers to win the match. 5/10, so John Laurenitis has control of both shows. Eve hits the lowblow on Ryder and leaves the ring as the rest of Team Teddy looks on.

-Here we have a highlight package of Wrestlemania Axxess, with many superstars interacting with the fans.

-CM Punk is backstage and Team Johnny is walking by celebrating, Laurenitis says to Punk if he gets DQ'd he will lose the WWE title also.

-WWE Championship Match, If CM Punk gets Disqualified He Will Lose the WWE Title, CM Punk (Champion) vs. Chris Jericho: For weeks Chris had run down Punk's family in an effort to get under his skin and the question was could Punk not lose his cool during this contest. There's some good mat wrestling early on and Jericho tried everything to get to Punk even shouting ""How's your father?, How's your sister?"". Punk was about to hit him with a chair, but stopped himself and took it to Jericho, but got a suplex off the apron to the floor.

Chris targets the back, with a back breaker and sends him off the second rope to the ring for two, Punk tries coming back and dodges the running bulldog sending Jericho into the turnbuckle. The momentum keeps going back and forth, Jericho locks on the Walls of Jericho which Punk powers out of, hits a kick but only for two. After more big moves Punk goes for a hurricarana off the top but Jericho locks on Walls however Punk gets to the ropes. Nice suicide dive to the outside by Punk, then back in the ring Chris hits the Codebreaker but only for two. Punk tries for the GTS but again the Walls is locked on but Punk counters, then locks on the Anaconda Vice and Chris finally taps out. 9/10.

-Brodus Clay comes out, does some bad comedy and I mean bad comedy which should've been saved for Smackdown. Big time yawn.

-Once In A Limetime Match, The Rock vs. John Cena: For over a year this match has been hyped, mainly on Twitter with the war of words between Cena and Rock. Sean ""Diddy"" Combs and introduces some hip hop artist named MGK that I couldn't really care any less about and he does a performance, then John Cena's music hits and the crowd boos massively. Flo Rida comes out and raps to introduce The Rock, who gets a thunderous and I mean thunderous reaction from the crowd.

After the in ring introductions they face off in the center of the ring, the bell rings and we are off an running. Cena displays some power early on to a mixed reaction, Rock fires back and gets a big reaction, then some arm drags by Rock and a roll-up for two. Rock gets some more moves in and Cena goes to the outside, John then comes back in, hits some shoulder blocks then locks on a bearhug. On the outside Cena targets the ribs slamming Rock into the announce table, then beats him up more in the ring working the ribs over.

Rock makes his comeback, goes for the People's Elbow, however Cena begins to hit his 5 moves of Doom, goes for the AA, Rock counters they hit dueling clotheslines and are down in the ring. We get a massive AA but only for two and the crowd is on fire, a Rock Bottom but just for two, then Rock beats him up in the corner however a sideslam by Cena gets just two. Cena gets locked in the Sharpshooter twice and breaks the hold both times by getting to the ropes.

Cena does lock on the STF, pulls Rock back to the middle of the ring and Rock finally gets to the ropes to break the hold. Rock ends up getting a second wind and hits the People's Elbow, just for a two count. The closing minutes are great as each man goes for the kill but can't put the other away, Rock goes for a crossbody, Cena catches him rolls through, hits the AA but only for two. Cena goes for the People's Elbow, Rock counters with the Rock Bottom and covers for three. 9/10.

First off, the 1st hour is slow. An excuse to let Big Show win something. Randy vs. Kane. I'm an Orton fan but this match didn't need to happen.

Triple H  vs. Undertaker according to other reviews is the BEST thing on here. It picks things up. It's a good match until halfway. Guest referee Shawn Michaels kills momentum with overracting. ""No. He's had enough. He's had enough. Oh my dear god. The humaaanity."" Triple H plays into it. The Super Kick-Pedigree combo on Taker was a nice touch.

CM Punk vs. Jericho. I still haven't watched. I can't get past 5 minutes of this. Absolutely boring. Followed by Team Laurinitus vs. Team Teddy bull-ish.

John Cena vs. The Rock was great. The intensity of the crowd then the finish. :-) It deserves 4/5 stars. The rest brings things down to a 2. FYI: This match is also on the Rock-Cena Once In A Lifetime set with other matches and promo features. ;-)",1389052800,,1100,4.399014778325123

- WOW. This match was EPIC. This is what Wrestlemania is all about, two men putting on a hell(in a call) of a match! One moment you actuall think the Streak is ending, it was a roller coaster.

Match #6 Team Johnny vs. Team Teddy
- This match was a litlle slow, but at the end it started to pick up and it was over.. hmmm. Miz continued his undefeated streak.. 3-0.. Exciting, he's awesome ANYWAYS. 2/5.

- ""Hey Punk, hows your sister?"" Lol. Anyways this was a really good match up. techincal. comical. I really enjoyed this match up. Jericho and Punk are great athletes who deserved the spotlight at Wrestlemania. Punk wins, via submission. 4/5

Main Event ""Once in a Lifetime"" (lol) The Rock vs. John Cena
- This match was really good! Crowd was hot. Could of done with the entrances, but thats waddevs. I was dead set on Cena winning, since he is there everyday. Love him or hate him, you really have to respect what he does and what he puts his body. All wrestlers for that matter. Cena mocks Rock which costs him the match up. Rock wins via Rock Bottom. 4/5

The main event and Taker vs HHH made up for it. We've had Cena jammed down our throats for so long now that its like he won't go away. Finally Rock came back and got the title. What a relief. It was good to finally see Super Cena or whatever you want to call the face of the company finally lose. I didn't count how many moves Cena actually got on rock. I'm sure it couldn't of been many like the usual case. Taker vs HHH was a match people really didn't want to see again but they surprised everyone.

WRESTLEMANIA 28

This was a big Mania historically since The Rock returned and was coming off a yearlong build to his match with John Cena. And that of course was what most people were looking forward to. Me myself I was looking forward to Taker vs. Triple H with HBK returning as the special ref. The event had good matches, great matches, and of course celebrities, especially in the main event.

1.[WORLD TITLE]DANIEL BRYAN VS SHEAMUS-I am sure everyone now knows what happened with this match. I have to say I absolutely hated it, why waste what could have been a great match. This thing turned into an 18 second squash match with Sheamus becoming champion.

2. RANDY ORTON VS KANE-the next match would see Orton coming at Kane hard and trying to take him out early. Randy looked good in this match delivering things like a wonderful dropkick but Kane kept coming back. This was a pretty good match and I loved that it ended with Kane winning. I really felt like Orton needed to lose this one but when we were watching live I just knew WWE was going to have him win. Luckily I was wrong and the right guy won, Kane was back to being evil during this time.

3.[I-C TITLE]CODY RHODES VS BIG SHOW-this match was all about Big Show having his Mania moment and finally coming out on top. This like the last was a good match over all but nowhere near the best on the card. Cody of course worked his speed here and tried chopping Show down but it was not to be. Show finally got his moment.

4. BETH PHOENIX & EVE VS KELLY KELLY & MARIA MENOUNOS-this was a much better match than it was supposed to be. There is always the forced Diva's match and of course the celebrity appearance. Well this match gave us both and I have to say I was impressed with Maria. She had previously injured her ribs on ""Dancing with the Stars"" with cracked ribs I believe and still wrestled in his match. Plus all the other ladies worked well here especially Beth as you will see. Your typical Diva's match but a good showing over all especially with an injured celebrity who actually wrestled in the match.

5.[HELL IN A CELL with SHAWN MICHAELS AS SPECIAL REF]UNDERTAKER VS TRIPLE H-I was honestly surprised that this match was this early on since I knew it was going to be good. I was excited that HBK was back in some way as the ref. This turned out to be the best match on the card in my opinion with all three adding to it. When I watched this it reminded me of the great storytelling matches from back in the day. Both Triple H and Taker were brutal to each other here giving us a great back and forth contest. But in my opinion it was Shawn that made this match even more special. Watch and I am sure you will see what I am saying. In the end Taker keeps the streak alive but it is the embrace in the ring and up the ramp to the stage that makes this a great Mania moment.

6. TEAM LAURINAITIS{DAVID OTUNGA, MARK HENRY, DOLPH ZIGGLER, JACK SWAGGER, THE MIZ, & DREW MCINTYRE} VS TEAM LONG {SANTINO MARELLA, R-TRUTH, KOFI KINGSTON, ZACK RYDER, THE GREAT KHALI, & BOOKER T}-I really enjoy these multi man matches because of the fast pace each usually delivers and the high spots of course. Trust me I love a great classic match but sometimes a quick, fast paced, and high spot highlight reel match is just fun. I of course was all about Johnny Ace's team and wanted them to win. Thankfully they did after a very entertaining match that even had Booker T joining the match which is always cool.

7.[WWE TITLE]CM PUNK VS CHRIS JERICHO-what do you do when two guys both think they are the best in the world? You put them in a match at Wrestlemania of course especially if the two guys can make legitimate arguments to make that claim. Now before the match Johnny added a stipulation saying that in Punk was DQ'd he would lose the title. This of course only added to Jericho's offense since now he could play his mind games using Punk's past against him. Punk did not fall for it and forced Y2J to wrestle him. This of course was great for all us fans as this was a great match between the two. Punk goes on to keep the title and further his claim to being the ""best in world"".

8. JOHN CENA VS THE ROCK-of course we come to the main event and the match that the mainstream was all about. The match had so much hype behind it and a yearlong build that got more interesting as the year went on. In fact the build even had Cena return to his rapping ways, both he and Rock were entertaining. So did the match live up to the hype, I guess it depends on who you ask. To me personally I think it did live up to the hype but it fell short of epic, I don't know how else to describe it. The match was very good and the Rock is always entertaining no matter what he does. Both men had near falls and delivered with their performance. Of course I am sure you all know who won this one, which of course was The Rock after Cena got cocky attempting the people's elbow.

BONUS MATCH
1.[TRIPLE THREAT TAG TITLE]EPICO & PRIMO VS TYSON KIDD VS THE USOS-this was a fast paced triple threat match with the usual high spots in these types of matches. There is even one moment that leaves one man injured for real. In the end the champs Epico and Primo retain their titles.

This was a good Mania over all that had no bad matches in my opinion and some really good ones. It delivered for the most part but it wouldn't be my favorite. There are some great special features like the HOF of course and stuff from Raw amongst others.",1358208000,,5490,4.269230769230769

5060157,5,B0077AYMXM,"I saw this live in Miami and it was by far one of the best WrestleManias to date. There were some amazing matches on the card, so I will start with those

Daniel Bryan vs Sheamus for the World Heavyweight Championship
This match goes to to the Royal Rumble where Sheamus won the opprotunity to face the champion of his choosing. At the Elimination Chamber, he had announced he would face Daniel Bryan. At WrestleMania, prior to the match starting, Daniel had asked Sheamus to wait a minute so he could get a good-luck kiss from his girlfriend, Diva AJ Lee. He turns around, gets smacked with a Brogue Kick and is pinned, making Sheamus the World Heavyweight Champion. Wanna hear the kicker? Sheamus won the match in a matter of 18 SECONDS! No kidding.

Randy Orton vs Kane
This match was announced a week before WrestleMania on SmackDown. Kane had called Randy Orton out and wanted to wipe him out on the grand stage. They both put up a good fight, but Kane won.

Big Show vs Cody Rhodes for the Intercontinental Championship
This match was set up by former SD GM Teddy Long, who said that he was tired of showing Big Show being embarrased at WM, so it was time for Cody to be embarassed, by losing his prized possession. In the end, Big Show won and became the only WWE Superstar to hold every title.

Kelly Kelly and Maria Menounos vs Beth Phoenix and Eve Torres
This match was set up on an episode of Entertainment Tonight when Maria did an interview with Kelly. Just then, Beth barges in asking why Maria is interviewing her instead of the Divas Champion. She tries to attack but Kelly reminds her that they can't fight outside the ring, so Eve comes in and offers a match. Maria, never being a match before, surprising accepts and they win. BTW, why is it that everyone hates the hot Divas (cough, Eve, cough)?

End of an Era: Triple H vs The Undertaker with Specal Guest Referee Shawn Michaels inside Hell in a Cell
This came into play the night after Royal Rumble when Taker interrupted Triple H's job evaluation of John Laurinaitis. He denied at first but accepted when Taker thought he was just like Shawn because he couldn't do it. He agreed on one exception, they fight inside Hell in a Cell. A week later Shawn was announced as the Special Guest Referee. The match ended with Taker pinning Triple H, extending the streak 20-0.

Team Johnny vs Team Teddy for role of GM for Raw and SmackDown
This match came into play when John Laurinaitis thought he should run both shows. Over the course of the month, both he and Teddy added members. At WM, the match was lost when Zack Ryder was distracted by Eve helping him pull off his famous Woo Woo Wooo, allowing Miz of Team Johnny to pick up the win and make John Laurinaitis (who I hate with every bone in my body) the new GM of Raw and SmackDown. After the match, Eve, Zack Ryder's now ex-girlfriend, kicked him in the crotch and dumped him, becoming a suck-up to John.

CM Punk vs Chris Jericho for the WWE Championship
This match was announced after Chris Jericho had constantly accused CM Punk of being an alcoholic and didn't deserve the WWE Championship. Prior to the match, his new boss John Laurinaitis told him if he lost his temper, he automatically lost. Punk won and remained WWE Champion

Once in a Lifetime: John Cena vs The Rock
This match dates back to WrestleMania XXVII. The Rock had attacked John Cena, costing him the WWE title to The Miz. The following night on Raw, Cena called The Rock out, saying that if he's going to attack him, he should do it in a proper match. This lead The Rock to challenge John Cena to a match at WrestleMania XXVIII, one on one. At Survivor Series, The Rock and John Cena were tag team partners in the main event against Awesome Truth. They won, but The Rock attacked Cena again, to send him a message to what to expect at WrestleMania. After the Royal Rumble, Cena and Rock started appearing frequently on Raw and SmackDown, trying to get fans to rally behind them. Prior to their match at Mania, two musical performers performed songs reflecting both contenders. MGK performed the theme song Invincible, a rap song in reflection of John Cena. Miami native Flo Rida performed Good Feeling and Wild Ones in reflection of Miami native, The Rock, who defeated John Cena when he finished him with a Rock Bottom.

Also on the DVD is the 2012 Hall of Fame ceremony featuring Ron Simmons (DAMN), Mil Mascaras, Mike Tyson, The Four Horseman, Yokosuna (represented by his children), and, the Rated-R Superstar himself, Edge. It also features Santino announcing he will have a cameo in the season opener of Deadliest Catch.

First of all, WWE looks great in HD, this blu ray is no exception. You can see the vibrant colors of the crowd, the details of the wrestler's costumes and of course, enjoy the music of Flo Rida and Machine Gun Kelly. Unfortunately, Machine Gun Kelly got the crowd hot with his pop for Cena. Sean Combs should have told MGK that when in Miami and The Rock is on the bill, don't insult the crowd (especially if you are in the entertainment business and your revenue is dependent on people buying your music, etc) he got the biggest ""booo!"" but luckily Flo Rida came out and did his set piece and got the crowd back on their feet and excited for the ""Once in a lifetime"" main event.

A few notes on the matches:

Daniel Bryan vs Sheamus

Waste of a match, 18 seconds and its over! Bryan is capable of giving his opponents great matches and people were clearly shouting his ""YES, YES, YES!"" phrase as he entered the ring. Everybody expected a great battle and instead got a ""blink, brogue kick, 1, 2, 3, over"" match. Overall rating 1/5.

Randy Orton vs Kane

Standard wrestling match, Orton and Kane traded shots until Orton tried a RKO off the second rope, Kane made his move and captured the victory. Overall 3/5

Big Show vs Cody Rhodes

Good match with lots of hype, Cody brings back the classic Intercontinental belt back, awesome, he plays a classic heel by taunting on Big Show's failures and Show finally makes his Wrestlemania moment by knocking out Rhodes with his WMD finisher. Overall 3.5/5

Beth Phoenix and Eve vs Kelly Kelly and Maria Menounos

You can already tell this is going to be horrible since a celebrity is involved, a month prior, Kelly Kelly came out on WWE magazine saying she wanted her Wrestlemania moment and clearly, it was handed to her, it wasn't earned, it was handed to her. Phoenix and Eve clearly dominated the match and I remember the crowd made fun of Maria Menounos' attempt at a stinkface on Eve, since Eve's makeup smeared on Maria's backside, which sums up this match. The ""pretty faces"" manage to get a victory and further erode the Women's division, poor Beth, she deserves serious competition. Overall 0/5

Undertaker vs Triple H, Hell in a Cell

This is the match of the night, Triple H seeks to end Undertaker's undefeated streak with Shawn Michaels as the referee. Undertaker and Triple H trade numerous stiff shots, slam each other against the cage, beat each other with various weapons and all the while, Shawn is torn by his duty as the referee and his friend. Shawn does break his oath by hitting Sweet Chin Music on the Undertaker but that was not enough to keep the Deadman down, Undertaker pulled the power of the darkside and buried Triple H and kept the streak intact, 20-0. After the match, all three men left the ring together, they were clearly moved by the match and they all left as victors and legends. Overall 5/5

Team Johnny vs Team Teddy

Now for a goofy match, after all the emotion of the Hell in a Cell match, the crowd needed a break so we got this 12 man tag match. Booker T makes an appearance and takes a beating but he fights back, a brawl breaks out and Eve distracts Zack Ryder long enough for the Miz to take the victory for Team Johnny. The stakes were high in this match because the role of permanent GM of Raw and Smackdown was on the line, Teddy Long lost and John Laurinaitis began his ""People Power"" era. The match has its high and low spots but it felt more like filler but it was entertaining. Overall 2/5

CM Punk vs Chris Jericho

Back to serious action, Jericho had been pushing Punk's buttons with his taunts, almost reminded me of when Jerry ""The King"" Lawler taunted Jake ""The Wino"" Roberts (okay, I know ""The Snake"" but lets have some fun here) about his love of alcohol. Jericho plays a great heel, special light up jacket, arrogant facial expressions and overall jerk persona. Punk takes out his rage but keeps in check since his title can be lost if he gets disqualified. Punk breaks the Walls of Jericho and slaps on the Anaconda Vise and gets Jericho to tap out, sweet victory for Punk. Overall 4/5

Brodus Clay comes out to fill out the pay per view, corny dance number with his ""momma"" and the bridge club, not bad but luckily you can skip this on the dvd. Isn't technology great?

MGK plays ""Invincible"" and gets on the crowd's bad side, which only gives more heat to Cena (which he doesn't need) and Flo Rida does ""Good Feeling"" and ""Wild Ones"", very nice introduction for:

John Cena vs The Rock, Once in a Lifetime match.

For one year, Rock and Cena have traded verbal taunts and gotten physical a few times but it all leads to this, the main event of Wrestlemania 28. The Rocks shows the crowd and Cena that he has a few moves and takes Cena by surprise a few times. Cena has more recent ring experience and The Rock's ring rust begins to show as Cena dominates the match, both men avoid each other's finishers and Cena nearly snaps the Rock in half with his STFU. The Rock looks physically drained half way in the match and it almost looked like he was going to pass out, however, Cena let his confidence get the better of him and when he tried for a People's elbow, the Rock pounced and nailed a Rock Bottom for the win. The Rock accomplished something amazing, he was beaten Stone Cold Steve Austin, Hulk Hogan and John Cena at Wrestlemania. Miami was clearly split between Cena and the Rock and this brought memories of Warrior vs Hulk at Wrestlemania VI, at the end, half the crowd was happy, half were upset. Cena is left alone on the ramp, soaking in his loss and what lies ahead....to be continued (in Extreme Rules 2012). Overall 4/5

The Blu ray extras are okay, a few clips from Raw, the Hall of Fame with Edge! Edge's induction into the Hall of Fame is emotional and he can see how moved he and those around are during his introduction and his speech but I loved how he leaves the show, awesome.

5060178,4,B0077AYMXM,"I got this DVD at walmart the day it came out, I did not order the PPV and I had to see the epic match with the Rock Vs. Cena, I think this was light years better then last years, but not the best wrestlemania you'll ever see. You'll see why when
 The first hour is the weakest of the show, with the WHC none event, a divia/star match and Kane Vs. Orton.
 Things pick up when HHH, Undertaker and The Show Stopper. come out for their Hell in a Cell match. This is one of the best matches I've ever seen. I love the story these theree guys tell in the ring. This match had me haning on eveymove, thinking that every near fall was the end. And I knew who was going to win!! This match was a peice of art, and it's sad that the Undertaker will retire soon and we won't get to see matches like this when he dose.
 The team Johny/Team Teddy match was pretty good. Then we have the WWE Title match CM Punk Vs. Y2J, not the best match, because the stipulation that if Punk gets DQed gets over played a bit, but in the end this match more then makes up for the WHC ""match"", and is one of the better matches of the show.
 Then Rock Vs. Cena. Everything about this match is epic. The Inrtos, the crowds reaction, the match it's self. The rock winning was the icing on the cake. Good PPV, and worth a buy on DVD/Blu ray.",1341100800,7,1308,4.0

#1 The rock vs. John Cena.

#2 The Undertaker vs. HHH

#3 Cm punk vs. Chris Jericho.

But the best match out of all three,would have to be The Undertaker vs. HHH.I am telling you that was a great match,i didn't think it would be a good match,reason is,is because i didn't think they could pull off what they did last year. And i am happy to say i was wrong,i love the ending of this match The Undertaker, Shawn Michael's,and HHH.They where rising each other's hand on stage,it was a great moment. Now moving on to The Rock vs. John Cena,this was my top match that i loved. It was great Machine Gun Kelly,and flo rida preformed,before The rock,And John Cena made there Appearance. I am Happy The rock Won,I have alway's been a fan of him,ever sense i was little. And my last match that i love,Cm punk vs Chris Jericho,in order to see who's really the best in the world. Great match loved it,i could go on,and on,and on.",1338940800,2,1027,4.333333333333333
5060190,4,B0077AYMXM,"The 28th WM is easily the strongest in the last several years; it has a few flaws, but they're passable enough to make Wrestlemania 28 an enjoyable watch.

One thing that aides this WM to rise above the last few are the much better backstage segments and special moments that the last few have been desperately lacking.

Lillian Garcia starts off with America the Beautiful and some nifty pyros go off.

The undercard this year is weaker but passable enough to not lower the overall impression of the show.  The show starts this year with yet again the Royal Rumble winner and the World Title match.  This is also the second consecutive year featuring insults to the talents of Daniel Bryan and Sheamus.  Not sure if there were time constraints here, but needless to say this 18 second squash was a very disappointing way to start the show.

So the buildup of Bryan's character is flushed down the drain and we move on to a match thrown together a few weeks before the show.  Kane and Randy Orton put on a match bounds better than I thought the two of them were capable of.  The chokeslam off the top rope is not nearly as vicious as most people made it out to be, but it was a nice refresher for Kane to win the match.  Decent length, but not too long to bore you.

Next, The Intercontinental Belt was finally defended at WM next in an average to below-average match between Big Show and Cody Rhodes.  The storyline buildup was given plenty of attention for a month or so before the show, but this match was never going to be a classic.  Watchable, but nothing you're going to care to see again.

Celebrity appearance matches at WM are never good, and the diva tag match featuring Kelly Kelly, Eve, Beth Pheonix, and Maria Menounos was no exception.  There are several missed spots and bad timing; but hey, at least this type of match was early in the card.

The show finally picks up when Jim Ross rightfully comes down to ringside for broadcast of the end of an era match.

The Hell in a Cell between the Undertaker and HHH was an unspeakable moment.  I won't attempt to do this justice with words; so I'll just say the only way to appreciate its greatness is simply to just watch it.

Oddly enough, the Smackdown vs. Raw tag match serves as the cooldown from the spectacle that we've just seen.  All those left from the show piled onto two teams to duke it out to see who was going to be GM of both shows.  The match is good enough for being a cluster of people trying to get their spots in.  WWE tries to spice up the ending with Eve's heel turn on Zach Ryder, which I think we all saw coming.  This match served its purpose without overstaying its welcome, which I was completely fine with.  Team Laurenaitis gets over on Team Teddy Long when The Miz hits his finisher on Ryder.

I believe the Hall of Fame Ceremony highlights were after the tag match, but nonetheless was a special moment on the night.  Edge makes an emotional return along with the rest of the inductees.

The WWE Title match between Chris Jericho and CM Punk was the great pure wrestling match this PPV needed.  It was a hell of a contest with tons of near falls and innovative reversals and counterholds.  One of the best WM main events in many years; however I wouldn't expect any less from these two.

The ""Once in a Lifetime"" match between the Rock and John Cena was undoubtely the main event on the night.  There was nothing WWE could have thrown into this match for it to live up to the hype they had been building for a whole year.  They did this match right from start to finish; The Rock looked great, as did Cena.  The match really takes a brisk pace at the end with tons of false endings and dramatic moves and finishers.  The Rock finally gets over clean on Cena, and the show ends with Cena sitting in disbelief on the ramp way.  A great way to end the night.

This year's Wrestlemania was a definite classic.  There were no DUDS on the card and finally no cheap endings or match outcomes.  WWE did everything right with their three main events on this night, so on that alone, make sure you pick up a copy of WM28.",1338940800,,4104,4.35836627140975
5060191,5,B0077AYMXM,"OK, so everyone has reviewed this product as the show itself, that's fine, WM 28 was a great show and had that big show feeling as the recent past ones have lacked. I'm here to review the Blu-Ray itself and say FINALLY, WWF / WWE Does It Right!

For the first time I can remember in a LONG time this release is the EXACT Program as the PPV. No Music Edits, No Re-Shots, and Actually in the case of the HITC Match it's even better as they do not try to alter HHH's ""Final Stand""!

As Mentioned ALL the Music as seen on the PPV is here, Metallica, Madonna, Flo Rida, etc. is all here. The Mini Concert(s) are here, it is truly a welcome addition!

This is the way it should be done, in the past the PPV was far superior to the DVD / Blu-Ray not this time, in fact the Blu-Ray is better than the PPV. Congrats to WWE for finally getting this right!

Btw, the Extras are cool with the HOF being the best treat. Ron Simmons speech(with JBL Intro) by far was the best of the HOF's, IMHO, even surpassing the 4 Horseman. The HOF is truly worth it's weight as a stand alone, IMHO. The Press Conference is really corny, I'm starting to lose a lot of respect for CM Punk as he really is becoming to ""Hollywood"", this P.C.(as well as Punks current escapades as of late) really made me miss the days of the Straight Edge Savior, watch it and you'll see what I mean. Other than that it is the Best WM Release in a Long, Long Time (in terms of the non-edit and production value) and for $19.99 (Blu-Ray) it is a Steal!",1336608000,19,1504,4.122866894197952
5060192,5,B0077AYMXM,"I watched it for the 1st time in years on Payper view first. Some have complained that either the Shamus & Danials match was to fast! or the Kane & Orton match to slow. I grew up back in the early 70's watching MSG's channel show that months event hours later in the middle of the night. back then the guys took over 15 minutes to just warm up the crowd & each other. Today there is to much acrobatic moves & finishers that aren't moves that should end a match. I thought Kane & Orton did a great job taking the time to really give us a feel that they wanted to give us a decent match & not rush it to a fast finish. The Shamus bro kick was just the thing to put that match aside , so we could get to the really good gravy of the show of the decade. HHH w/Michaels as a ref. vs. The Undertaker was not the best Hell In A cell match of all time, But for the 1st time in years, the undertaker showed he had the endurance to take HHH to the limit & pull off another win for an unstoppable streak for us real pro wrestling fans. Big Show finally got to give/take Cody Rhoodes to the well & throw him in & get that big win they have taken away from Big Show over the years at W.M. But every one forgets that @ WM 20 @ MSG in the 1st match, John Cena took the US title from big show to give cena the pop he needed at that time in his career. B Show is the Andre Giant of our time. He could take away anyones title on any given night, but it's pro-wrasslin as DUSTY RHOODES would say { whom also was kept from title statis back in his time because he was the american dream & the PEOPLES CHAMP LONG BEFORE THE ROCK EVER PUT IN HIS DADDIES TRUNKS !! I don't wanna give away the deep grit of the night, buy this dvd if you only buy 1 this year & you will not be disappointed. It was a night of expectations & big surprises, thats what pro-wrestling is all about. I just wish they brought back more of the older type moves to make us fell the pain when a guy gets put down & gets pinned for the 3 count. As Ric Flair would say:Woooooooo!!",1336608000,,2028,3.8774038461538463
5060193,5,B0077AYMXM,"After last year's dud a Wrestlemania I was a little worried about how this mania would deliver.  My worries melted away as I watched a fantastic WM from start to finish.  This WM learned from last year and did not waste so much time on the little things.  One thing that I found strange was that it appeared that the 78,363 fans that attended the event just did not seem like they were into the show at all.  I really don't remember a single part of the show where the fans became rabid and really into the show so that kinda brought the show down a bit but not enough to ruin it for me.  The show opened with WWE ring announcer Lillian Garcia doing a rousing rendition of America the Beautiful and of course the fly over from the US Military.  After that we get your standard WM opening promo.

The opening match, which might start to become a new WM staple, was the WWE World Heavyweight title match pitting Daniel Bryan against Sheamus.  I for one was really looking forward to this match because last year these two were supposed to go at for the US title and the match was bumped to a dark match and because I am a huge Bryan fan and was hoping to see him let it all hang out at this event.  That was not to be because this would shortly become one of the shortest matches in WM history.  Eighteen seconds!  Eighteen seconds was all it took for Sheamus to win the title from Daniel Bryan.  This was sort of a rip off for me but geez what a hell of a way to begin the program.  (8/10)

After that we get a backstage moment from Team Johnny which was ok and then we get a commerical for WM 29 and find out that it will be at Metlife stadium next year.  After that we get a pretty good match from Kane and Randy Orton.  I really was hoping for a down and out fight between these two but instead we a get a rather slow and plodding match but I still enjoyed it.  I was a little suprised that Kane won but still an ok match.  (6/10)

After this we did get a boring segment with Mick Foley, Santino Marella and Captain Keith from Deadliest Catch fame.  I don't remember now what the segment was about but it was a waste of time.  We see Cody Rhodes intro and some footage of what led up to the IC title match followed by the Big Show into.  I always look foward to an IC title match at WM because now they are so few and far between but this one did disappoint me a little bit.  I thought it was pretty good but a little short.  I was also suprised that Show won the title because let's face it, Show has already made it and Cody is one of the few bright spots that WWE has to look forward to in the future so I do think that having Cody lose was a big mistake.  (5/10)

The next segment we get is a feature on the divas which was good to see, followed up by the intro of Beth Pheonix and Eve and then we see some of the events that led up to the Divas match and the intro of Kelly Kelly and Maria Menounos (who is the celebrity this year).  The match was pretty good but really just a standard divas match.  I did appreciate Maria's tenacity in the match due to the fact that she had some cracked ribs due to an injury on Dancing with the Stars.  I do hate when celebrities compete at WM because they never lose so it was no suprise when Kelly and Maria won.  (5/10)

Up next we get a great interview with the great Shawn Michaels that was definatly not a waste of time.  They of course announce the attendance next and then we get a special entrance of Jim Ross so he can commentate the following match.  I don't understand these special intro's that they do just for commentator.  It's a waste of time, just have them already out there.

The next match is the Hell in a Cell match and one that I had been waiting for and was a little suprised that it was this early in the show.  Of course each man in the match even Shawn gets their own entrance and then they lower the Cell to Metallica's The Memory Remains (which will probably be deleted from the DVD release due to royalities).  This match was brutal and a killer match.  I have never seen so many chair shots in one match but boy did this one have that and more.  There was so much emotion and so much brutality that it was hard to watch sometimes.  Will it win match of the year?  No probably not.  I thought it was great for over a half an hour but no I don't think it will win match of the year.  A couple of things that suprised me:  Undertaker's new haircut.  What the hell was that about?  Why was it a Hell in a Cell match because the cell was hardly used.  Lastly, I was very suprised that UT won.  I really was.  I have heard that UT has stated over and over that he does not want to retire with a perfect WM record so I was a little suprised that UT won.  Great match and great performances by all involved including Shawn Michaels.  (10/10)

The next segment is one of my favorites at we get footage of the Hall of Fame ceremony and then the announcement of the class of 2012 which included:  Ron Simmons, Mil Mascaras, Mike Tyson (in the celebritiy wing), Yokozuna, The Four Horsemen (Ric Flair, Arn Anderson, Barry Windham, Tully Blanchard and JJ Dillion) and Edge.  This was a good class and I was suprised that Flair was there as he is under contract with TNA and I was also suprised that Windham was there as he has a heart attack or stroke in November or December.  Great class and all deserving!

After that we get a waste of time with a segement involving Heath Slater and Flo Rida.  Nothing much there.  After that we get the 10 man tag match for control of Raw and Smackdown.  For Team Johnny we have The Miz, Mark Henry, Drew McEntyre, Jack Swagger, Dolph Ziggler and David Otunga taking on Team Teddy's which was comprised of Kofi Kingston, Great Khali, R-Truth, Zack Ryder, Booker T. and Santino Marella.  This was a good match and everyone did get to get involved in the match but really there was no suprises here.  I mean really did anyone think that Teddy's team was going to win?  If you did then you were just living in a fantasy world.  (6/10)

After this we get footage of WWe happenings in Florida.  Then we see CM Punk backstage with Johnny who announces that Punk's match will now be a no DQ match.  Lastly, we get Chris Jericho's entrance followed up by events that led up to the match and CM Punk's entrance.  I know a lot of people did not like this match but I for one loved every second of this 22:00 minute match.  It was billed as ""Best in the World vs. Best in the World.""  This match did deliver that and more, in my opinion.  I just wish these two could have went close to a half hour if not more than that.  A lot of back and forth action and some great near falls is what really made this match great and makes it one that I want to see again and again.  (10/10)

After that I guess they had to cool everyone off for a bit because we get this retarded segment with Brodus Clay and his Momma's Bridge Club doing a stupid dance segment.  We get the events that led up to the Main Event and that is followed by special ring intros for both John Cena and the Rock.  Finally, we get to the match and we get in my opinion one of the best WM Main Events that I have ever seen.  We see back and forth action, near falls, false finishes and each guy performing all the moves that made them great.  For over a half hour these two guys went out and gave it their all and left me exhausted.  I do not like John Cena but honestly I was kind of hoping he would win because he would still be with the WWE when it was over whereas the Rock would be gone once again.  I have to give my props to both men they really pulled out a great match.  I was expected maybe a 18:00 to 20:00 match but never thought we would see a 30:34 match.  Really cool moment in WM history.  (10/10)

All in all this was a great WM from start to finish.  There were some slow matches and one or two matches that didn't live up to its potential but it was a whole hell of lot better than last year's flop.  I would definatly watch this one again.  I would say this WM was a 10/10.  Great matches from UT and Triple H, CM Punk and Jericho, Rock and Cena and an 18 second world title match is what made this one great!",1336521600,,8180,4.087366436203646

5060196,5,B0077AYMXM,"One of the biggest WrestleManias ever that I actually ordered on PPV. Hi, I have finally decide to start being a reviewer again, considering that my last one was for SummerSlam '11. This event had 3 matches that I was extremely excited about. I hate long intros so lets go to the review.

1. World Heavyweight Championship Match:
Daniel Bryan(c) vs. Sheamus (0:18)
Not alot of people should have expected much from this match but 18 SECONDS!!!! OK, I don't understand why they would even put this match first. Last year, there was supposed to be a US Championship Match between these men, but it made the pre-show, lasted 2 minutes then ended in a no-contest. To make up for it, the match was made a main event but it felt like once again barely made the card. I won't spoil it, but it is what it is.  No rating.

2. Randy Orton vs. Kane (10:56)
I knew this match would be good. This was a match worth watching, and it can be acceptable for a WM match. It had a decent pace, nice back-and-forth maneuvers, and took up a fair time slot. Nice and unsuspecting ending, not much more. 8/10

3. Intercontinental Championship:
Cody Rhodes(c) vs. Big Show (5:18)
At least this match was better than expected. It was no squash, and it had fair back-and-forth pace, for a match like this. Watc it or not, still alright, 7/10

4. Beth Phoenix and Eve vs. Maria Menounos and Kelly Kelly (6:49)
I normally say that these matches suck, but I liked it. 7.5/10 4 Matches in and were not even done with the first hour

5. Hell in a Cell Match ""The End of an Era""
The Undertaker vs. Triple H (Shawn Michaels as Special Guest Referee)(30:52)
The world was waiting to see how Undertaker would fight his 20th match at WM,and I have the answer; BALD! HIAC was a good touch to this match, its too bad this match was slow. Trust me, I liked it, and this isn't negative, but it's not like HBK vs. Taker at WrestleMania XXV. The match last year was bvery good, which gave more hype to this match. Problems included, slow pace, and little use of different weapons. 9/10

6. Santino Marella, R-Truth, Kofi Kingston, Booker T, The Great Khali and Zack Ryder (Team Teddy) vs.
David Otunga, Dolph Ziggler, Mark Henry, Jack Swagger, The Miz and Drew McIntyre (Team Johnny)(10:38)
It's about time they included a 12-man tag Match at WM, I don't havve much to say about this match, can't give away every match. 8/10

7. WWE Championship Match:
CM Punk(c) vs. Chris Jerciho (22:21) ""YES! YES! YES!"" Sorry, wrong match. Anyway, fantastic match. Way better than expected, and that's saying something. This match was inside, outside, back, forth, pin, submission, kicking out, reaching ropes, so much action. The storyline of Jericho making fun of Punk's family didn't suprise me. But, anyway, this match rocked! Two submission and high-flying specialists fighting to determine the ""Best in the World"" made this great. Everything did. 9/10

8. ""Once in a Lifetime"" Singles Match
The Rock vs. John Cena (30:34)
The most hyped-up wrestling match in history. A whole year ago, it was announced, and I have waited just that long. All of the Rock Bottoms to Cena before this match were pretty much equal to the amount in this match, same with Attitude Adjustments. This was face-paced and amazing. Memorable moments were at the beginning when one side of the the crowd chanted ""Lets Go Cena"" and the other side chanted ""Cena Sucks"" similar to WM 18. The ending was great also, I suspected it, but I doubt that a lot of people did. This match was worth the year. Could be Match of the Year, lets see if 2012 goes as good as '11 did. 9.5/10

In the end, I did give this event 4 stars, I decided to bump this up because I think people will enjoy this more than I have, it seems like that already happened. In one night, we had 3 major Match of the Year Candidates. It's nice to know Rock at least won, then left. I doubt changing my review will affect anything, so if your'e reading, it's your opinion.  I reccomend buying just about every Mania, except for 27, just watch the No Holds Barred Match. HERES TO AN EPIC 2011 OF BUILDUP, THE ERA OF TRIPLE H AND UNDERTAKER, AND THE DEBATE OVER ROCK AND CENA. THANK YOU, AND GOOD DAY.",1334275200,2,4184,4.506596306068602
5060197,5,B0077AYMXM,"For the past three years, WM has been a lackluster event that wasn't worth the price and was saved by one match. That match being Taker's match. But WM28 is what WM is and should be about. Only problem is it wasn't like that throughout the entire event. I hope we get a true WM next year that is better than WM28, if possible as I will be attending WM29.

Daniel Bryan vs. Sheamus - WHC
An 18 second World Title match. That's what this was. I didn't expect it to last as long as the other 3 main events since it got very little attention. But 18 seconds? I can't really review this except for saving that was an awesome Brogue Kick.

Winner: Sheamus

Randy Orton vs. Kane
A slow match. It was physical though. Better than I thought it would be. What surprised me was that Kane won. But I was glad he did since he hasn't won a one on one match at WM since...a long time. Wicked Chokeslam off the top rope!

Winner; Kane

Cody Rhodes vs. Big Show - I.C. Title
Let's be honest. We all knew this wasn't gonna be a classic or a memorable match. But I got what many others wanted as well: A positive WM moment for Big Show. He deserves it.

Winner: Big Show

Kelly Kelly & Maria Menounos vs. Beth Phoenix & Eve
Didn't see this cause didn't want to. I've been outspoken for a long time about my feelings on celebrities having wrestling matches anywhere, much less at WM. I know it's for publicity. But you don't need celebrities, inexperienced or not in matches to get publicity. Despite Maria & Snooki competing at WM, Tyson's WM14 involvement garned more publicity than both of them combined and he didn't wrestle at WM!

But out of all the celebrity matches I have seen at WM, this was the best one. That's not really saying much though. Gotta hand it to Kelly Kelly here. She did really good. I loved her Glam Slam counter.

Winners: KK & MM

The Undertaker vs. Triple H - ""The End Of An Era"" Hell In A Cell match with HBK as special guest referee

What can I say about this that hasn't already been said? First off, it was great having JR calling this. I always said if there is one event a year JR should call, it's WM. If one match, Taker's WM match. It was reported & I think JR conformed that he called HIAC at Taker's request. Rock & Cena may be once in a lifetime. But Taker/HHH/HBK in the ring at the same time is the last in a lifetime. I think that's what The End Of An Era meant. People think this means Taker's finished. I see him coming back for WM29 or possibly before. Considering the shape the man was, I don't see him retired yet. I hope he does compete at WM29 as I'm attending the show just for that. He's the reason I still watch WWE. When he leaves, WWE will lose tons of viewers. This one is one for the ages and deserves multiple views. Love Taker;s mohawk. But I was diggin the spiked entrance attire just as much if not more. Two good points were brought up during the bout. One from Cole who stated that every match refereed by HBK that HHH has been in, HHH has won. To add further speculation to the possibility of HBK causing Taker to be screwed, they could have also stated that HBK has refereed one math Taker was in which was Summerslam 97 against Bret. And HBK losed his cool and ended up costing Taker the match that night. The second good point was brought up by Lawler who said Taker cut his hair daily till HHH accepted the match because it was driving him crazy. To me that meant Taker cut his hair because he didn't wanna look the same way he did at WM27 meaning something had to change so he decided his hair look would be different for WM28. It also meant that he'd do anything this time to win even letting his trademark long hair be no more. After a hell of a match which saw tons of chair shots being dished out with Taker taking so many vicious ones repeatedly, there was a huge bruise on his back, Taker eventually won & is now 20-0. What followed must be seen with your own eyes. I nor anyone else can do the aftermath justice so I rather not try.

Winner: The true Mr. WM IMO, The Undertaker

Team Teddy vs. Team Johnny
I did not see this because I didn't want to. I thought since this was to see who controlled RAW & SD, this should have been saved for either RAW or SD. I also knew Ryder's stupidity would cause Team Johnny to win.

Winner: Team Johnny

CM Punk vs. Chris Jericho - WWE Title
Either this or HIAC deserved to close the show as these matches were the show stealers. IGREAT! Just a great match that really lived up to my expectations. Their feud is continuing so I hope to see more show stealing matches from these two.

Winner: Punk

The Rock vs. John Cena
I was pissed because my cable went out as The Rock was coming out. It went on and off a few times before going off again. It went back to normal as the last picture frame started fading out. So I missed the match. But since it was still fading out, I knew who won. Based on reports, I didn't miss much so I'm not angry anymore.

Winner: The Rock

All in all, better WM than the last 3. Match of the night was HIAC. But IMO, Punk/Jericho not far behind. If anything, those two bouts are worth the price of this set. The blu ray, in addition to being better quality than the DVD, will likely have exclusive features so if you're gonna get this, I recommend the blu ray edition.",1334016000,3,5292,4.190944881889764
5060208,4,B0077AYMXM,"Before I get started, it should be noted that Lilian Garcia did ""America The Beautiful"" at the start of the show & WWE plugged this event as the ""social media event of the year"" with numerous Twitter trends that were mentioned throughout the show. There were also many celebrity appearances throughout the night such as the host of Discovery Channel's ""Deadliest Catch"" did a backstage skit with Mick Foley & Santino Marella (remember the Royal Rumble) while musicians Machine Gun Kelly & Flo Rida performed & although he's not a celebrity, we had a special performance from Brodus Clay & his momma's ""bridge club."" It should also be noted that the commentary team was strictly Michael Cole & Jerry Lawler with Cole being more serious than he has been in the past year as he wasn't his usual ""heel"" self making the commentary tons better than it usually is.

World Champion Daniel Bryan vs. Sheamus - I could try to sum this match but how do you do that for a match that lasted 18 seconds & only had one move? I didn't mind it with matches like Kane vs. Chavo Guerrero or even going back to Hart Foundation vs. Bolsheviks but a World Title match...NO! NO! NO!

Randy Orton vs. Kane - Orton came out the box physical from the start taking the fight to Kane & even stomping him down. However from here, the match kept it's same slow pace as both men worked on grounding each other with the only memorable offense being Orton dropkicking Kane in midair while with one of the biggest chokeslams Kane has ever delivered. This match just never seemed to leave first gear & kept the same pace which is disappointing considering how their last match months earlier on SmackDown (which was referenced as to how this feud started) & the rematch later in the week were miles ahead in quality.

Intercontinental Champion Cody Rhodes vs. Big Show - After being embarrassed for weeks, Show came here to fight but Rhodes avoided him early before eventually attempting a dive onto Show only for him to just catch & press him back over the top. Show dominated here by just tossing Cody around & even delivering the old stinkface in the corner before Rhodes focused on Show's legs trying to keep him down on the match taking away the power & size advantage. This was an average match that wasn't anything special past Big Show finally getting a ""positive"" WrestleMania moment.

Kelly Kelly & Maria Menounos vs. Beth Phoenix & Eve - For those who have no clue who Maria is, she's a host on the celebrity news show Extra (an obvious NBC/Universal crossover here) & has had made a few previous appearances in WWE as a RAW guest host & Tribute To The Troops. Maria came into this match with two cracked ribs from her time on ""Dancing With The Stars"" so Beth & Eve targeted that throughout the match with moves like the body scissors & side bear hug. Normally the divas matches aren't much to talk about at Mania but I'll give this credit in that Maria played her role well in being on the defensive & building the hot tag to Kelly while Beth & Eve actually told the story of working over the injury while I had to give extra credit to Beth here in being one tough woman for taking Kelly's top rope flip full on while also having enough strength to hold Kelly up for a few seconds so Kelly could do the bulldog correctly. This was the celebrity match so the result was a given but again, I'll give it credit in that we got an effort to have an actual match here than we normally get with a divas match at Mania.

Hell In A Cell Match with Shawn Michaels as the special referee: Undertaker vs. Triple H - Couple of notes here as Jim Ross returned to join commentary for this match, Michael Cole pointed out the interesting facts that not only has Triple H has won more HIAC matches than Undertaker but also never lost a match where Shawn was the referee, and Undertaker finally revealed his new haircut. Taker was dominate at the start as he targeted Triple H's head using anything he could get his hands on from the steps to the cell, and his own head to deliver headbutts causing HHH to have a bad bruise on his face. The steps were put into the ring where Triple H was able to deliver a spinebuster only for Taker to apply the Hell's Gate right after before Triple H showcased his strength & dead-lifted Taker to get out of the hold. Shawn played an important role as the referee as both guys got physical with him at times while also trying to be the voice of reason such as when Triple H continued to deliver non-stop chairshots to Taker's back to the point where Shawn tried to step in telling him, ""just pin him because you know he won't give up!"" only for Triple H to respond ""You end it or I will!"" This was physically brutal as both men didn't hold back with the chairshots & other weapons while just beating each other into exhaustion & Shawn definitely played an important role here. This lived up to the hype, no questions asked.

Team Teddy vs. Team Johnny: Each Bella Twin introduced the members of the team they were representing while Jerry Lawler made a joke about the suit Johnny Ace was wearing in reference to Brother Love which was the definition of the phrase ""TOO SOON!"" if anyone knows the story behind what's happened recently to the real Brother Love. This match really resembled the previous multiman matches at the previous Mania's where there were multiple tags quickly so everyone had their time in the ring but only very few doing anything you would remember like Mark Henry's midget tossing, a triple set of top rope flip dives, and Ryder flipping Dolph so hard that he turned inside out. Just based off the issues between one of the participants & the person who accompanied him to ringside, you just knew exactly what was going to happen but the tag match was good for what it was.

WWE Champion C.M. Punk vs. Chris Jericho - The battle to see who's really ""The Best In The World"" got a special twist before the match as Johnny Ace added the stipulation that Punk would lose the championship if he got disqualified. Jericho kept trying to have Punk lose his temper earlier by taunting him about his family but staying close to the ropes to Punk would have to break by the count of five or lose the match & even pushed Punk so far by daring him to hit him with a chair. After seeing that those tactics weren't working, Jericho tried to out-wrestle Punk & work over his back after doing a suplex that had Punk land on it hard while Punk would later be pulled off the top rope with his head bouncing off the mat. The match got very competitive as it went on with each guy having various reversals & counters to their signature moves along with some hard hits like Jericho's head being sandwiched between Punk's high knee & the ringpost while Punk was also caught in midair by the Codebreaker. The DQ stipulation hurt the match more than it helped (remember WrestleMania 25?) because they kept overplaying it but once they decided to forget about it & just wrestle then we got the quality expected from two of the ""best in the world.""

The Rock vs. John Cena - The Rock came into this match ready to go as he took Cena off guard with armdrags & even catching him in an inside cradle early on. Cena targeted Rock's midsection by grounding him on the mat with a bearhug & moves like a belly to belly suplex before taking the action on the outside where he kept dropping Rock on his ribs. The match continued to pick up from here with both men trading momentum by kicking out of each others signature moves while pulling out all the stops like Cena's legdrop from the top rope while Rock threw Cena into the steps at one point before one man made one mistake in letting the crowd get to him which cost him the match in the end.

In the end, it was three out of the four main matches that really saved this Mania from being like how it's been almost every other year where it was a one match show while the undercard had it's moments & there wasn't anything really important (keyword: IMPORTANT) on this show that I couldn't say was heavily unwatchable with the only major negative thing being the World Title match so it's a Mania that I would check out.",1333929600,7,8158,4.436957971981321
5060209,5,B0077AYMXM,"I was in the audience of this wrestlemania it was truly amazing. At first Lilian Garcia sang the National Anthem. once she hit the last notes a couple of jets flew over Sun Life Stadium and scared the crap out of all 78,000 of us. It was a truly amazing night though.

(c) Primo & Epico w/Rosa Mendes vs. The Usos (jimmy & jay) vs. Justin Gabriel & Tyson Kidd
I had no idea this match was going to happen honestly, I don't even know how the Gabriel and Kidd team happened. well it was a very high flying and impressive match nonetheless. Gabriel jumped to the top rope to hit a moonsault and accidentaly fell and got up and did it again, apparently injuring himself in that process. Usos got some good shots in and Primo & Epico basically just hid the entire time in my opinion. good match though. champs retain

1. World Heavyweight Championship
(c) Daniel Bryan w/AJ vs. Sheamus
hilarious way to start out a great night. two great entrances, a lot of build up toward the match, all that for it to end in 18 seconds! it seemed like everyone was cheering for Bryan as this is the event where the ""YES! YES! YES! YES!"" chant started for the crowd. Bryan turns his back after the bell to makeout with AJ and as soon as he turned around he ate a brogue kicked and was pinned. sheamus celebrated while bryan moped his way up the ramp. new champion, Sheamus

2. Randy Orton vs. Kane
Everybody goes nuts as the Viper enters the arena. This match was fun to watch although there was only about 2 weeks of quiet buildup towards this match. both these men went back and forth getting some impressive shots and moves in. Kane certainly seems to have his monster side back i just don't see why now that he is back he is going around randomly attacking people. anyway, orton goes for a super RKO off the top rope but Kane reverses into a top rope chokeslam and wins the match. then he starts running away from the ring for some reason.

3. Intercontinental Championship
(c) Cody Rhodes vs. Big Show
i don't know how Rhodes has held his title this long but he was finally going into a match where the odds were towering over him tremendously. He was going against a man about 2 feet taller than him, And to make matters worse, he had made the giant angry in the past few weeks. For the first few minutes of the match Big Show took out his anger on Rhodes tossing him around. then Rhodes started coming back and got one of those kicks on the Big Show, at that point i thought it was over but Show didn't go down, then Rhodes went for a second kick and show speared him in mid-air (it looked like he speared him in the crotch) then set up for the WMD. smacked Rhodes in the face with it and ended the 8 month title reign of Cody Rhodes. new champ, Big Show

4. Beth Phoenix & Eve vs. Kelly Kelly and Maria Menounus
This match wasn't too bad actually, compared to other women's matches in wrestlemanias past. Not much to talk about really, Phoenix and Eve led the entire match until Kelly Kelly came in and took everybody out then Maria got the pin.

5. End Of An Era Match
Hell In A Cell
Undertaker vs. Triple H
special referee: Shawn Michaels
I cannot say enough about how legendary this match was. both men knew what they were getting themselves into. After the three men entered the Undertaker made a little surprise for everyone i didn't really understand. He flipped his hood up and released he had shaved his head into a mohawk of some sort. Then the match started, so many chair shots were thrown in the match. Eventually Michaels just started feeling like the two were going to kill each other and super kicked undertaker. then when he kicked out michaels about lost it. i honestly don't think they took good advantage of the fact they were in a cell and fought with chairs and steel steps instead. Then undertaker somehow pulled out the victory. it took awhile, but taker eventually got to his feet this year and then helped triple H to his. Shawn and taker proceeded to help triple H up the ramp and they took a good long look at the audience then left the arena.

6. Team Teddy vs. Team Johnny winning team's GM gets control of both RAW and Smackdown!
Team Teddy: U.S. champ and team captain Santino Marella, Kofi Kingston, R-Truth, Booker T, Zack Ryder, Great Khali w/ GM of Smackdown! Teddy Long, flag bearer Hornswoggle, Brie Bella, Eve and Aksana
Team Johhny: team captain David Otunga, Mark Henry, Dolph Ziggler, Jack Swagger, The Miz, Drew McIntyre w/ GM of RAW John Laurinitaus, flag bearer Vickie Guerrero, and Nikki Bella
Nobody was really into this match most people were getting food and and taking bathroom breaks. i stayed and watched though, there was a lot of cool action and good tags. my favorite spot was when Ryder, Truth and Kofi frontflipped over the top rope onto the entire team Johnny except the Miz, who was in the ring, Ryder then got back up, and was about to finish off Miz when Eve distracted Ryder and cost him and team teddy the match. then after the match it looked as if she was apoligizing to Ryder then she kicked him where-the-sun-don't shine. She then walked out with Team Johnny to the disgust of everyone.

7. WWE Championship
(c) CM Punk vs. Chris Jericho
i had no idea who to cheer for in this match i love both these wrestlers even though Jericho can get a little out of hand sometimes. The crowd was mostly on Punk's side but some were with Jericho too. lots of grappling and high flying too, jericho locked in the walls of Jericho at least 3 times but punk absolutely refused to tap to the man who insulted his mother, father and sister. Punk hit a nice flying clothesline off the top to the outside and jericho just couldn't get the lionsault no matter how much he tried. punk eventually hit an extremely impressive grapple roll-up into the anaconda-vise. Jericho took awhile but he tapped. proving that punk is who he says he is, the best in the world.

8. Once In a Lifetime Match
John Cena vs. The Rock
THE BEST buildup to a match in the history of the company. rocky had the entire crowd (save a few little kids) on his side and cena's entrance had the most boo's ive ever heard, cena released his new green T-shirt and MGK rapped his entrance. then rocky had Flo Rida sing his entrance with a lot more applause. the two men had made this match one full year ago because of rock costing him the WWE title one wrestlemania prior for those of you who don't know. the match lived up to its potential as these two brought it to each other like never before. in the very end, Cena had found only one way to put the rock down for the count. He actually went to hit the people's elbow. but as he jumped over rocky he got up and caught cena turning around. hitting a rock bottom and winning one of the biggest matches of all time. cena sat on the ramp wondering what to do next. the rock celebrated his victory and cena left the arena never looking back.",1333843200,,6950,4.37722695584818

5060211,4,B0077AYMXM,"Johnny Notebook review is about as accurate as it gets.  For me as a fan I definitely enjoyed the entire show but for all the hype given... a lot of these matches fell short of expectation.

I told my wife the best match would be the HIAC and surely it was.  And the performance HBK, HHH and the Dead Man put on WAS EPIC and Jim Ross on the mic added the finishing touch.

Punk and Y2J were great but I thought this match would end with more BRUTALITY with all the personal jabs in the buildup!

I personally wanted to see Bryan go down but not that fast.  Bryan and Sheamus deserved a good match.

Is it me or is Kane missing that it factor!  He seems to be injured.  I truly think the WWE could benefit by giving him a lot of time off to heal and get himself back into ""debut"" form.  Then plot one heck of a return!  HOWEVER, the Viper and Monster match was okay.

The other matches were okay as well but could have been much better considering the marketing of this WrestleMania!

CENA/ROCK - after all the trash talk and hype, they entered, they stared, they fought and then it was all over!  GREAT match but kind of following Johnny Notebook, after watching the okay matches then the EPIC HIAC match with Jim Ross on commentary...  by the time they did the Funkasaurus skit and entrance performances (they could have done WITHOUT) it just didn't capture and continue the momentum of the HIAC match.  STILL A MUST SEE THOUGH!

With all the criticism, as an avid fan, I would definitely recommend this for any fan.  With the exclusives and features that will be included it will be a must have!  And if they include the following nights Raw showing on the disc, then you will have an incredible disc!  --->>> (Brock Lesnar return, Lord Tensai debut, etc...)",1333670400,,1760,4.3734567901234565
5060212,3,B0077AYMXM,"I can't remember the last time Wrestlemania had this much hype to it. Even last year was modest compared to this year. The show had a great opening with Lillian Garcia singing America, The Beautiful. She always adds a sense of class to PPV.

Sheamus vs. Daniel Bryan for The World Heavyweight Championship

This was an excellent opening match! I can't believe how hard fought it was!

Seriously though, I sat in silence as the 18 seconds went by while on the inside, I felt betrayal. Was this a cruel April Fool's joke? Was WWE trying to re-create Ultimate Warrior vs. Honky Tonk Man for the Intercontinental title? No matter how they try to rationalize it, this was extremely poor booking on WWE's part. No one pays 50-65 dollars for nonsense like this. Sheamus got a hollow victory while Bryan was portrayed as someone who doesn't deserve a top spot in the company.

During the 4 hour duration we also got stupid backstage segments, commercials, and horrible ""concerts"" that went on forever. The amount of time that went into these scenes could have made for a good athletic contest between the two screwed wrestlers.

I got to hand it to the audience though since through-out the show, they kept chanting ""Daniel Bryan"" and ""Yes! Yes! Yes!""

Randy Orton vs. Kane

I already didn't care about this match, but especially after Sheamus/Bryan, I was already in too bad a mood to enjoy this. But ignoring that, this was an un-remarkably average match. Knowing about the 2 concussions Orton has received over the last several months, I felt that he shouldn't have been made to compete, especially since he couldn't go all out. It was obvious that Orton and Kane were both holding back. I understand that WWE wants their top guys on their biggest shows, but it shouldn't be at the cost of their well-being.

Cody Rhodes vs. Big Show for the Intercontinental Championship.

Also extremely average. You never got a sense that the odds were against Big Show, and he never came close to losing. For all the mockery Cody had shown to Big Show leading up to this match, he looked pretty weak against him.

Maria Menounos and Kelly Kelly vs. Beth Phoenix and Eve Torres

With her 2 broken ribs, Menounos should not have competed. This could have been turned into a 6 woman tag match with AJ Lee and Natalya added, and she would only have to be tagged in for the pin. As it stands, with the exception of Kelly's somersault senton, the match was really slow and boring. It was almost like watching a delayed car crash. It's especially bad when the Women's Champion gets easily pinned by a non-wrestler with broken ribs!

Undertaker vs. HHH: Hell in a Cell

The Cell got it's own entrance music? Anyways, this match was great storytelling. While I liked their 2 previous Wrestlemania matches better, Taker and HHH had a good brawl and thankfully Shawn Michaels did not interfere too much. There were some great near falls and I thought Taker could lose at any moment. While I understood why Michaels would want to stop the match, I could have done without that aspect, especially since the crowd would have rioted if he did. This was a good way for Undertaker to close the last chapter in his career.

Santino Marella, Kofi Kingston, Zack Ryder, R-Truth, Booker T, and The Awful Khali vs. David Otunga, The Miz, Drew McIntyre, Mark Henry, Dolph Ziggler, and Jack Swagger

While I think every match on a PPV should be 4-5 stars, Taker and HHH was a tough act to follow, so it's good that a less important match was put on afterwards. This match though just screamed ""We got nothing for the rest of the roster, so lets throw them into a cluster."" Khali still sucks, and the talents of the others were wasted as there was no reason to get emotionally involved. Truth, Kofi, and Ryder did a crazy dive outside the ring, but even that didn't feel exciting. And the ending sucked. Despite how loved by the audience Ryder is, WWE still wants to portray him as an idiot who's not worth anything.

CM Punk vs. Chris Jericho for the WWE Championship

This was the match I was looking forward to the most, and these two men most definitely put on a great athletic contest. Outside of that, I didn't care for the ""How's your dad? How's your sister"" moments. That storyline added nothing to this bout. Once that nonsense was glossed over, we got a slow, (not boring) methodical battle that turned into a great series of reversals and ended with a crescendo of submissions. Lance Storm worked with Jericho at SWA and planned a lot of the spots for this match, and knowing their history it was cool to notice which parts were ""Thrill Seeker-like."" I hope this is on Punk's DVD.

John Cena vs. The Rock

The crowd was lively for this. I'm not the biggest fan of either guy, but they definitely worked themselves half to death putting on a great show. The Rock displayed some good wrestling moves, yet still has a mediocre sharpshooter. But this wasn't about technical wrestling, it was an emotional fight and full of action throughout. No matter who won, I would be happy.

I would only recommend this show for a cheap price. The 1st hour was like being bled dry, and even though the 3 main events were great, it's difficult to say that it's worth sitting through nonsense to get to them.",1333584000,4,5258,4.603208556149733
5060213,4,B0077AYMXM,"Like everyone before me has said, the first half of the show was a little slow/lackluster. I was looking forward to Bryan and Sheamus, but sadly, this was an 18 second squash. I truly don't understand the booking or logic behind this. These two guys can go in the ring (especially Bryan as I'm sure ROH fans know) and for this to only get 18 seconds does a lot of damage to the World title (not to mention Daniel Bryan) Randy Orton and Kane was decent for what it was. Nothing to spectacular. Cody Rhodes and Big Show was a dud in my view, although I'm glad to see Show get some gold. The Diva's tag match=who cares. Then we get the Hell in A Cell between HHH and Taker with HBK as the ref. My gosh! This match was so special. These guys busted their butts and really provided drama and suspense. Tombstones, pedigress, chockslams, even HBK nailing Taker with the superkick (at which point I thought the streak was over). A classic match. Taker got the win and goes 20-0, but these legends put on a hell of a show. Great moment when all three walked out together and hugged. It truly did feel special and like an end of an era. Great stuff. Team Teddy vs Team Johnny was decent. Had some good spots here and there with Eve (predictably) turning on Zach Ryder and costing Team Teddy the match. Punk and Jericho was another very good match. These two worked what I thought was a very stiff match. A lot of good back and forth, with Punk picking up the win. Of course, this WrestleMania was built around Rock and Cena, and I think they delivered. By no means was it a classic, but it did it's job in having that special feel to it. The match was a little patchy in spots and the Rock at times did look a little as if his conditioning wasn't the best (though I'll cut him some slack, since this was his first singles match since 2003) but in the closing moments, these two brought it and the Rock picked up the victory, which was a great (since I'm a huge Rock fan). The Miami crowd ERUPTED when Rock won which is honestly, one of, if not the biggest pops the Rock has ever received winning a match (Backlash 2000 with the possible exception). The only real complaints I have about this show (besides the Word title match) was all the segments. The segment with Mick Foley and Santino was unnecessary, along with the silly segment with Brodus Clay and his ''mama''. And my gosh, I know this is WrestleMania and all, but could the WWE please cut down on all the musical acts. My gosh, Flo Rida took about 15 minutes to perform while we awaited the Rock to come out (time that could have been given to Bryan and Sheamus, but I digress). Overall, this was a fairly good show. It's not as bad as some people have made it out to be, and though the first half was a little slow,  starting with Taker/HHH, things really picked up. Punk/Jericho delivered and so did Cena/Rock which more than made up for the slow first half (and the tacky Word title match). 4 stars.",1333324800,,2954,4.31294964028777
5060214,4,B0077AYMXM,"Undertaker vs HHH was the best match that did it for me! Including cm punk vs chris jerico! The main event was pretty good too, the Rock and Cena, not nearly as good as the hell in a cell! Its the only reason I would purchase the dvd!",1333324800,,234,3.8958333333333335

5060216,4,B0077AYMXM,"The best way to sum up this year's edition of WrestleMania is delivering when it counts.  The main reason people bought this show was to see Rock vs. John Cena, and in particular, to see Rock beat John Cena.  Both guys delivered a very good, entertaining match with a lot of twists and turns that, more importantly, ended with The Rock getting his hand raised to end the show.  The second biggest match on the show, the Hell in a Cell match pitting Undertaker against Triple H with Shawn Michaels as Special Guest Referee, was far and away the best thing on the show.  Lastly, CM Punk and Chris Jericho delivered an excellent wrestling match which was slightly hampered by a largely dead crowd.  The point is, the three matches that people cared about the most all delivered, and that is what puts WrestleMania XXVIII in the thumbs up category.  That being said, there were several negatives with the show.  For one, the undercard as a whole was one of the most underwhelming and forgettable in recent memory.  The biggest blunder, however, was the treatment of the World Heavyweight Title Match.  Before I get carried away, let's get on to reviewing the matches one by one.  Matches are rated out of 5 stars (*****).

1. World Heavyweight Championship Match
Daniel Bryan (c) w/ AJ vs. Sheamus

After the entrances, Bryan went over to the apron and kissed AJ.  Immediately after, Sheamus just ran over and delivered the brogue kick for the 1,2,3 and in 18 seconds we have a new World Heavyweight Champion.  This was a negative on four counts.  For one, it makes Daniel Bryan look like a fool, which is a serious mistake considering he's one of the future stars of the company and has carried the Smackdown brand since winning the title.  Secondly, putting Sheamus in the opener at WrestleMania equates winning the Royal Rumble with curtain-jerk status.  third, winning the World Title in 18 seconds doesn't really make Sheamus or the World Heavyweight Title seem all that significant.  Lastly, WWE jipped the crowd and its PPV audience (paying $65 big ones for the HD feed) out of what potentially could have been one of the better matches on the show.  I don't know if they were short on time or if this had been the plan all along, but this was not a good way to start this PPV.  DUD

2. Randy Orton vs. Kane

Fairly basic, slow-paced match here.  They had what would be considered an average Smackdown main event match and they didn't have a lot of heat, although there were ""DANIEL BRYAN"" chants in the early going.  After some decent back and forth action Kane won with a chokeslam off the top rope, which did get a big reaction from the crowd, who undoubtedly like myself were shocked that Orton didn't win this match.  There wasn't really anything wrong with the match but at the same time it was far from good.  *3/4

3. Intercontinental Championship Match
Cody Rhodes (c) vs. Big Show

Not much of a match here.  Show dominated early before Rhodes started going to work on Show's leg.  Naturally, this didn't play into the finish at all, and Show just speared Rhodes (badly mistimed I might add) and KO punched Rhodes for the win in a short match.  Story of the match was Big Show finally had his WrestleMania moment, and he did a good job acting like the IC title really meant something too him.  I felt good for Show who has worked very hard for the company for many years, but as a match this was well below average and didn't really do Cody Rhodes any favors.  *1/4

4. Kelly Kelly & Maria Menounos vs. Beth Phoenix & Eve

This was a hideous match.  Menounos was working through a rib injury and you could tell she was in a lot of pain, but she gutted the match out anyway.  I really wish she hadn't.  Too many miss-timed spots to mention and this went way too long.  Some spots were so bad that we actually rewound them to see them again, such as Eve propelling her own head into the turnbuckle after Kelly had already walked away.  Menounos won after she rolled up Beth.  -*

5. End of an Era Hell in a Cell Match
Undertaker vs. Triple H w/ Shawn Michaels as Special Guest Referee

Before the match started they brought out Jim Ross to announce the match.  While Ross should have been calling the entire show anyway, I will take what I can get in terms of Jim Ross and WWE.  This was just a tremendous match with off-the-charts storytelling.  These two guys just brutalized each other with chair shots to the point that their backs were bleeding and filled with welts.  Michaels for his part was outstanding with his reactions and facial expressions, playing the part of the troubled friend who does not want to see his best friend lose but also does not want to see the Undertaker get destroyed.  They did a long, 30 min plus match with all the usual near falls and kicking out of finishers, and the crowd was super hot for the entire match.  In the end, despite a valiant effort from Triple H, it was Undertaker nailing the tombstone for the victory and a 20-0 WrestleMania record.  After the match, the three of them helped one another up and walked to the back together after embracing on the entrance ramp, which was a really special moment and a nice touch.  I cannot do justice to how well done this whole thing was.  ****3/4

6. ""Team Johnny"" (David Otunga, Mark Henry, Drew McIntyre, Dolph Ziggler, Jack Swagger, & the Miz)
vs. ""Team Teddy"" (Santino Marella, Booker T, Zack Ryder, Great Khali, Kofi Kingston, & R-Truth)

Stipulation was whoever's team wins would become General Manager of both Raw and Smackdown.  At the start the crowd was completely dead coming off the Hell in a Cell match, but once all the guys started doing their moves and some flips to the outside the crowd got into it.  The finishing sequence was pretty strong, with Zack Ryder running wild and looking like he would win, but after Ryder was distracted when Eve ran in the ring, Miz came up from behind and hit the Skull Crushing Finale for the win.  After the match Eve turned on Zack and kicked him low, and then walked away as John Laurinitis celebrated his team's victory.  Match was above average on the whole but still nothing special. **1/2

7. WWE Championship Match
CM Punk (c) vs. Chris Jericho

These two had what would probably be considered the best technical wrestling match on the show.  They worked a very good match with a lot of near falls and submission escapes.  The only problem with the match was the crowd, who were dead for a large portion of the match.  However, once Jericho locked in his first Walls of Jericho the crowd got really into it.  The finishing sequence was excellent with Punk escaping the Walls several times before locking in the Anaconda Vice.  Jericho escaped a few times with knees to the head, but eventually Punk locked it in tight and positioned himself so Jericho couldn't escape with knees, and Jericho was forced to tap.  Pretty big reaction for Punk retaining and the match was very good, but the lack of crowd reaction for the first half of the match hurts the overall rating slightly.  ***3/4

Before the main event Brodus Clay did a segment where he danced with women who were dressed like ""his momma."" The less said about this the better.  The more I think about how much time this took away from the opening match the angrier I'm going to get.

8. The Rock vs. John Cena

Machine Gun Kelly performed a rap song before the match and Cena came out afterwards to a lot of boos. After that, Flo Rida did a song and the Rock came out to an absolutely enormous pop.  The easiest comparison for me to make with this match would be to compare it to Hogan/ Warrior, but only from an in ring standpoint.  In other words, this was far from a technical masterpiece, but they worked a very entertaining match that at times had the crowd in a frenzy.  Cena was openly hated by just about everyone and the Rock was the clear favorite in his home town.  Not that anybody thought that would be different, but WWE still spent countless hours wasting our time on television trying to get Cena over to the point that there would be a 50/50 split.  Didn't work.  They went about 30 minutes and the Rock looked really tired in spots, but he still held his own.  Cena hit his usual sloppy offense, including his leg drop off the top in which he nearly killed poor Rock.  They both kicked out of each other's big moves, such as the Rock Bottom, People's Elbow, and the Attitude Adjustment.  Rock also locked in the sharpshooter several times but Cena was able to escape, and the Rock escaped several times from the STF.  The finish of the match was brilliant, which saw Rock come off the top rope but Cena caught him and rolled through, then hoisted him up for the Attitude Adjustment and nailed it, but Rock kicked out.  This was an awesome near fall and everybody bought that as the finish.  Cena, frustrated, then set Rock up in the middle of the ring and tried to do his own version of the people's elbow.  As Cena came off the rope to finish the move, Rock nipped up and hit the Rock Bottom for the 1,2,3.  To say the crowd lost their minds would be an understatement.  Everyone was literally leaping up and down with joy and screaming their lungs out in exultation.  This was the right finish in front of the right crowd in front of the right PPV audience and ended the show on a very positive note.  ****

Looking back, the first half of this show was pretty darn poor.  That being said, the three main events lifted WrestleMania XXVIII to a thumbs up and WWE sent everybody home happy, which at the end of the day is the ultimate goal.  I wish amazon allowed for 1/2* ratings, because this is more of a ***1/2 show than a **** show, but what can you do.  Not one of the best 'Manias but far from the worst, I would recommend checking this show out for the 3 main events and call it a day.",1333324800,,9828,4.467153284671533
5060217,4,B0077AYMXM,"Let me just start out by saying that there were a few good points to Wrestlemania, but less bad than last year.

First, UNDERTAKER VS HHH SHOULD OF BEEN ON LAST, NOT CENA VS ROCK, I'm sorry but it made the rest of the show look boring and predictable.  This was the only match that you really could not tell who would win, this match had the most drama and the most excitement.  I actually almost fell asleep during Rock vs Cena, that's how good Undertaker vs HHH was.  HBK almost screwing Undertaker was perfectly done.  You really thought he was going to lose.

As for the rest of the card.

Sheamus vs Daniel Bryan:  2/10  Daniel Bryan got what he deserved, the match sucked, but the result was awesome.
Kane vs Randy Orton:  5/10  It was a good match, but it wasen't that impressive.  The outcome surprised me, and Kane deserves another push because I love the gimmick
Cody Rhodes vs Big Show:  4/10 Big Show made Cody Rhodes look weak, but the title means nothing to the Big Show, except to rip Cody Rhodes of his pride.
There was a diva's match, but unfortunatly I used that match to take care of the girlfriend, therefore I have no review, except Beth and Kelly Kelly are hot.
End of an Era HHH vs The Undertaker:  20/10  Stole the show, great match of the year Candidate.  It should've been on way later.
Team Johnny vs Team Teddy:  4/10, a lot of tag spots as usual, but nothing exciting out of the ordinary.
Chris Jericho vs CM Punk:  7/10  It was a good match, but the Disqualification stipulation kinda ruined the match, the taunting was unneccessary.
John Cena vs The Rock:  6/10  Undertaker vs HHH was the real main event, I'm sorry but the chemistry was way off.  And losing to The Rock is nothing but hurting Cena's pride, ego, and ""Rising above Hate""  I think now he has truly embraced the Hate.  Though I love the way his character is progressing, the end of this match sucked.
