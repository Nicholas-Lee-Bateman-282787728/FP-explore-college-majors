3627787,5,B001HB1DFW,I bought this as an Xmas gift for a big evel fan. He absolutely loved it. Evel narrated it himself. Gives u a taste of who the legend really was and who he became thru his career.,1325980800,,179,3.864864864864865
3627788,5,B001HB1DFW,"I actually used this video as an introduction to Evel Knievel for my kids. I grew up during the height of his career and this video offers many, many highlights from that career. If you're an Evel fan yourself or want to introduce someone else to the world of Evel then this is a great video to have. It mixes interviews with behind the scene footage with the stunts themselves and it works.

Jump Over!!!!",1325635200,,406,4.413333333333333

8308377,4,B001HB1DFW,"Hubby has a scar from trying out an Evel Knievel stunt as a kid.  His mom even made him a costume!  This is an honest portrait of Evel Knievel from the stunt-man himself, his family, and friends.  All his stunts are in here along with Evel's commentary about them.  Robbie Knievel's start as a stuntman is also included.  The video quality isn't the best but the content is more than worth it.  Shipped fast-great price.",1359504000,,420,4.533333333333333

8308379,5,B001HB1DFW,"as a child growing up in the 70s i was blown away by this man and his motorcycle and then George Hamilton stars in a TV movie called Evel Knievel and i was hooked i wanted to be Evel Knievel but life had a different plan for me. since those years and the passing of Evel in 2006 i have become an avid collector and this film is an up close and personal look at the man and his wonderful carrier,Evel himself does the interview he is a very wonderful narrator and this movie is a must have for any fan or any one who wants to look back at the Hero's of the 70s era [i give this movie a big thumbs up!]thanks Evel for all the good times you are greatly missed.....",1329264000,,662,3.9477611940298507
