4710961,5,B005J4TLN4,"Erich Asperschlager, DVD Verdict --Attack the Block didn't have a Hollywood budget, but it doesn't feel like a low-budget movie either. Once the story kicks into high gear, the bulk of the film is a series of action set pieces, chase scenes, and gruesome alien attacks. In a world where CGI encourages lesser filmmakers to show every detail of their creature creations, Attack the Block deserves credit for its minimalist alien design. The film's signature jet-black beasties were shot practically, starting with performers in costume then adding a layer of computer effects to animate the glowing teeth-filled mouths and remove light and shadows from the fur. The process makes the aliens look like rotoscoped silhouettes, but with real-world weight.

Those stylized effects get the royal treatment on this 2.40:1/1080p AVC-encoded Blu-ray. Although Attack the Block is full of heavy shadows that swallow detail--a byproduct of the decision to push contrast, giving the film a comic book feel--everything that emerges from those shadows is sharp and vibrant. The transfer might not wow you, but it's a faithful reproduction of the film's organic mix of realism and fantasy. Likewise, the 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track won't rattle your walls but it's a well-balanced mix, with room for the original electronica score, surround effects, and dialogue that's as clear as these thick London accents are going to get.

Fans looking to go deeper into the block have plenty of HD bonus features to attack:

* Audio commentaries. Three feature-length tracks, divided into ""Junior,"" ""Senior,"" and ""Executive Producer"" commentaries. The junior track features Joe Cornish and young stars Boyega, Esmail, Drameh, Howard, and Jones. Cornish begins by asking them what they like and don't like about commentaries, followed by a laid-back hour and a half of the director quizzing the boys about a variety of topics, including their parents' reactions to the film, the film process, and the realities of growing up in South London. The senior track features Cornish with adult actors Whitakker, Treadaway, Frost (plus a couple of special guests). It's a more traditional commentary, with behind-the-scenes information and plenty of goofing around. The final commentary is a one-on-one between the director and executive producer Edgar Wright. Rather than rehash the specifics of the movie, pals Cornish and Wright chat about their early careers, the difficulties of making a first feature, and the ""high-concept, low-budget films"" that influenced Attack the Block.

* ""Making the Block"" (1:01:23). This thorough making-of documentary follows the production from casting to fliming. Following a loose chronology, the featurette is composed of cast and crew interviews and on-set shenanigans from throughout the shoot.

* ""Creature Feature"" (20:29). The film's distinctive alien effects go back to the performers who braved high temperatures and cramped conditions to bring the creatures to life. This featurette focuses on these actors--especially ""lead creature performer"" Terry Notary--as well as creature design and the special effects process.

* ""Meet the Gang"" (4:08). A character-by-character introduction to Pest, Jerome, Dennis, Biggz, and Moses.

* ""Unfilmed Action"" (4:59). Two scenes that were cut before shooting, presented in storyboard form with introduction and commentary from Cornish and Alex Esmail, an elaborate action sequence with Moses climbing up the outside of the block while being pursued by creatures, and an early argument between Pest and an Indian shop owner.

* ""That's a Rap"" (2:23): A montage of cast members showing off their considerable freestyle skills.

* The UK and US Red-Band trailers.

4710962,4,B005J4TLN4,"Here's a terrific little film that asks: What if angry, human-devouring aliens landed in South London and had to deal with a mixed ethnicity teen street gang?  Crude, profane and funny, this exceptionally well-crafted little UK import hits all the right notes and delivers a superbly poetic, colorful enigmatic stream of British lower-class teen jargon along the way.  The kid actors, many of them non-pros, are all terrific and the story reminds how a greater threat can unite and makes us stronger.",1318723200,2,500,5.085365853658536
4710963,5,B005J4TLN4,"Comedian Joe Cornish's debut film is a fun, inventive and highly original creature feature with a serious social message at its heart. The theme of Alien domination of Earth has been done to death in recent years, typically with massively overblown CGI effects, but Cornish's British low-budget debut takes a very different approach from the Hollywood blockbuster, localising the alien attack to one grimy tower block of a South London council estate.

A gang of South London hoodies mug nurse Sam (Jodie Whittaker) on bonfire night as she returns home from her shift, but are interrupted when an object crashes into a nearby parked car. Gang-leader Moses is attacked and bitten by a creature hiding within and, enraged, pursues it to a nearby shelter to beat it to death, while Sam takes the opportunity to escape. The gang agree that that the creature must be from outer space (""that's a alien bruv, believe!""), and parade the corpse through the streets like a trophy, returning to the hang-out of resident drug-dealer and horticulturalist Ron (played by a long-haired, shell-suit wearing Nick Frost). However, it is not long before much larger, more aggressive beasts begin to fall from the sky, drawn to the tower block where Moses and his friends reside. Later in the film, Cornish offers up a very sound biological explanation for the invasion, rather than avoiding the issue like most brainless blockbusters.

Sam is left justifiably shaken, shocked and angry at her attack, but eventually comes to rely on her assailants as her protectors as they face up to responsibility; a mutual respect developing between them. One character early on describes the kids as `***king monsters'. Indeed they are, to begin with at any rate. This leftfield (though hardly new) approach seems to have irked some viewers who clearly like their heroes to be whiter then white - as though life was that simple; as though the line between good and evil was so well defined. Cornish's well-made and optimistic point is that nobody is beyond redemption. In Attack the Block there is no glorification of the street violence that has become so relevant in the UK today, nor is there a patronising moral; only the central message that actions have consequences. Cornish is also careful to remind us throughout that despite everything our protagonists are, after all, still only children.

The young unknown cast is excellent; fresh and natural, and particularly the performance of John Boyega, thoroughly believable as villain turned hero, Moses. There are no terrible fake accents either - Cornish uses local kids as his protagonists, using local lingo.

Comparisons with Edgar Wright's Shaun of the Dead are inevitable, but unwarranted; they're quite different films. The characters in ATB are not comedic ones, and though the film has been made with plenty of wit and humour it is in fact at times a quite serious horror-thriller. Cornish is not scared to despatch some of his young actors to let us know he means business. In some ways it reminds me more of the early films of John Carpenter, which is no mean compliment. The film is full of neat touches and tips its hat to other sci-fi and cult films. The kids themselves live in `Wyndham House', a reference to the author of the classic novel `Day of the Triffids', and watch out for some nods to Spielberg's E.T, among others.

Cornish wrings absolutely everything from his 9 million budget, and is to be applauded for his creativity. Perhaps the climax could have benefitted from the extravagance that a few extra million pounds could bring, but it doesn't matter because part of ATB's charm is its small scale. The creatures themselves are extremely effective; jet black shadows with the majority of emphasis on rows of razor sharp teeth, luminous in the dark, where most of the action takes place. There's very little CGI; the creatures and their movements are actually mostly portrayed by a man in a suit. ATB's pacing is also spot-on, with a series of exhilarating action scenes and chase sequences, and at times it's heart-pounding stuff, aided by a thumping soundtrack by Steven Price and Basement Jaxx.

The blu-ray quality in terms of both picture and audio is superb, and there are some fine extras on the disc too, including a very interesting featurette on the how the aliens were designed, created and filmed.

Though not quite perfect, and undoubtedly not to everybody's taste, this is a thoroughly excellent genre film, bursting with energy and creativity, and for me a solid 9/10. I loved it.",1317600000,32,4547,4.959317585301838
4710964,2,B005J4TLN4,"Although I was really looking forward to seeing this movie, I was extremely disappointed! Essentially a remake of Critters without the take-no-prisoners bounty hunters, this story tries hard to develop likeable characters that you soon find yourself wishing would be among the next casualties! No explanation is ever given for why the aliens come to earth, or how the seemingly low-intelligence creatures managed to develop space travel. Nick Frost is completely underused as the marijuana caretaker, providing only a minor supporting role in the film. While the overall acting is convincing, there are several sub-plots that never develop enough to bolster the implausible storyline. The illuminated teeth of the creatures that dim when dead is a clever innovation, but actors running around in gorilla suits is pedestrian at best! Do not misunderstand, I am an avid fan of mindless sci-fi creature films like Slither, Feast, and The Hidden; however, this one just does not develop into anything whatsoever memorable. Sorry to be on the opposing side of those who found the movie to their liking, but the incohesive nature of this film made it fall way short of my expectations!",1317168000,8,1179,5.2105263157894735
4710965,5,B005J4TLN4,"I have to say that Attack The Block - written and directed by Joe Cornish - is a pleasant surprise on a number of levels. Given the premise, this could easily have been just another cliched alien invasion movie, but believe me, it is most definitely not. Two things immediately make Attack The Block a cut above any of the myriad films of that overworked genre:  1) As the writer, Cornish actually put a lot of thought into the script that makes this film fresh and imaginative, and (2) as director, Cornish was willing to take chances with his characters not being the usual earnestly cute 'safe' kids from American suburbia.

The basic situation behind Attack The Block is that, for some reason, alien beings are suddenly landing (crashing actually) in one of the seedier parts of London and are converging on one particular 'council block' (what here in the states would generally be referred to as a low-income housing project).  The council block in question is home for a street gang of young hoodies who make up most of the main characters in the film, and the situation quickly evolves into a fight for survival as the kids in the gang try to evade or kill the aliens attacking their block who increasingly seem to be coming after them in particular.

When it comes to the aliens, Cornish successfully avoids a number of cliches.  These aliens aren't cute and curious, and they aren't invading super-soldiers armed with superior technology.  They're not here to make contact, they're not here to study us, and they're not here to take over the world.  They aren't even sentient, but they are here for a reason, and I guarantee you'll never have seen this in any other movie that's come before; a quite notable achievement on Cornish's part.

The physical conception of the aliens is also quite fresh.  I don't want to give away anything, but Cornish does a great job of going fairly low-tech here, relying on older traditions involving physical costuming, lighting and prosthetics rather than CGI imagineering, and again, putting some actual thought into his aliens, coming up with something that isn't a retread.  One detail I can giveaway I suppose:  the aliens' teeth _glow_, a bright, gleaming fluorescent maw of myriad icy blue fangs that becomes a really cool effect, especially when you see them coming after you.

And when it comes to the kids, Spielberg this is not.  These kids have hard edges:  they're a gang of young hoodies who swear and smoke pot; they deal, threaten and steal.  The film definitely veers from the safe when it starts right off with the kids mugging a nurse!  It says something though that Cornish can set things up so that while it's clear that these aren't your typical clean safe suburbanite youngsters, he gradually fleshes them out into whole complex characters who can by empathized with if not exactly approved of. Little glimpses here and there remind us that for all their hard edges and their street tough bravado and swagger, they are still just kids.

The cast of mostly young unknowns is terrific.  John Boyega as Moses, the gang leader, is a natural, giving a layered performance, often with little more than a wordless look, that gradually brings out just how complicated his character really is.  Alex Esmail's Pest is quite engaging, alternating between being a mouthy little tough one moment and showing surprising frankness and vulnerability the next. And, after he gets chewed on by one of the creatures, being cheeky enough to hit on Jodie Whittaker's nurse as she's tending to his leg. Another great scene gives the girls in the block their due when the boys retreat to their flat and are taken down several pegs by Danielle Vitalis' feisty Tia and her cohorts who openly wonder what stupid stunt the boys have pulled this time to get into trouble. And who end up showing what they're made of when the creatures attack their place.

I particularly liked the sub-plot around two pre-teen baby-thug wannabees, played to the hilt by Sammy Williams and Michael Ajao, who keep trying to join up with the older boys - insisting on being called Probs and Mayhem - but who keep getting told by Moses and the others to bugger off and go home. At one point the exasperated Probs chides his pint-sized cohort ""No one is going to call you Mayhem if you keep acting like such a pussy!""

The dialogue is quite well done, though as you'd expect, the setting means that there's a fair amount of British working-class accent involved, and the London hoodie slang the kids use in abundance in particular takes a bit of getting used to. But it's quite effective in making the characters feel authentic and believable as a bunch of streetwise kids in their bizarre situation.

About the only actor familiar to American audiences would be Nick Frost (Shaun of the Dead, Paul) as Ron, the block's amiably laid-back pot grower who happens to have the most secure room in the building. The other adult actors are mostly from British TV and not really known here in the US.  Jodie Whittaker is excellent as Sam, the nurse who, after having been one of the gang's victims, ends up having to ally with them for survival. As one of the gang urgently tells her, ""There's worse things out there to be scared of than us tonight. Trust!"" Luke Treadaway is subtly comic as Brewis, one of Ron's regular customers whose bumbling attempts to fit in with the hoodies earns him their derision but who nonetheless stumbles on the reason behind why the aliens are coming after them. And Jumayn Hunter is perfect as Hi-Hatz, the block's big-league gangster the hoodies only aspire to be.

But a lot of what makes Attack The Block work is Cornish's deft hand as director and writer. The pacing is fast-paced and perfect, balancing peril with humor and action with character development so that there's never a point where the film drags or jars. And the balance of ingenuity and folly on the characters' parts makes them all the more believable in the situation that they're in.

Highly recommended for anyone who likes a good scifi/horror action movie that's more than just a rehash of things that were done to death long ago.",1316822400,103,6147,4.749295774647887
4710966,4,B005J4TLN4,"A while ago, I had the idea of setting a zombie story in a council block, because the idea of what a bunch of hoodies would do in the event of a zombattack amused me. Joe Cornish, I'm trifle cross with you, eavesdropping on my thought-waves like that. Not cool, man, not cool.

Anyway, yes, this delivers. Now, listen - this isn't a comedy horror a la Shaun. I say that because for it to be so, I'd expect the lead to be a comic creation. Moses is not. He's a sad but hopeful comment on our times, and he doesn't do or say anything remotely funny. Nor is the female lead a comedy part. It is left to the others around them to carry the comic load. I'd say, then, this is horror-thriller FUN rather than horror comedy. If you accept that, you won't be disappointed.

The dialogue zips along as an entity of its own. It's hoodie-speak. 'Merk' for kill, 'Allow it' for 'leave it', etc. I'm very glad the US viewers were able to get along with this, because I think it's a huge part of the ethos of the film. These guys live in their own world with their own rules and language is not only a reflection of that but a large part of setting the film apart from that's out there. I mean 'Oh, my days!' instead of the ubiquitous, 'Oh, my God!' is just such a fresh relief (familiar to those of us who are around working-class black kids, but refreshing to hear in a horror film)!

So there you are, in a different world, and in the opening scene, these kids mug a nurse at knife-point. The writer and director would really have to bring it to turn this around so we care about the kids, was my thought. Then the aliens arrive in a meteor-like landing camouflaged by its being Bonfire Night. Usually, the kids would be the first victims and the nurse would escape to warn her neighbours and the battle would begin with her. Lovely to have this turned on its head. The hoodies are the perfect army for this battle, being fearless (mostly), territorial, loyal, used to conflict and not given to huge amounts of philosophical musings. Come on, that's not the perfect squaddie?

Everyone loves the line where one of the kids says, 'This is too much madness for one text'. I personally hooted when the girl (Paige Meade) opens the door to the flat and mouths off why she ain't letting them in, yeah, a long litany of reasons, delivered with facety, teeth-kissing bossiness (US viewers, think ghetto finger-waving). Then the other girl comes to the door and says it's her flat and they can come in.

The non-hoodies are a solid bunch of characters, and I salute Cornish for not making the stoners too out of it, because we've seen enough of that 'woah-dude-ness', thank you. I would say that the nurse is a bit too posh, but not fatally so. I loved the posh stoner listening to his out-of-date reggaae (""Skengeh-skengeh!""). The monsters are good enough, giving great death and mayhem, though like many movie-monsters, they are scarier the less you see of them. The ref to Night of the Living Dead, where Moses emerges from the lift, covered in blood, and the police swoop on him - fantastic. John Boyega is especially impressive as Moses, and he and Cornish do indeed manage to turn us around in our opinion of him. I truly hope British producers don't waste Boyega, as they waste so many black actors who then defect to the US.

There are so many little gems in this movie. The big man on the block who refuses to get with the fact that he's been usurped as the baddest threat tonight (it's behiiiiiiind you!); the kid going inside to tell a casual lie to his nan before heading out alien-hunting; the revelation of Moses's 'secret' that nearly had me tearing-up.

The young actors are wonderful; the adult actors sure-footed at their craft (the posh stoner is one of the up-and-coming Treadaway brothers, Jodie Whittaker, getting her horror chops, was a stand-out in the lovely 'Marchlands' and we know about Nick Frost).

This is a horror thriller for our times; our knowing, tough, lean-and-mean times. And it is a treat.",1316822400,38,4010,4.498626373626373

It had it's comedic moments, yes, and they were well timed, but I wouldn't have called it a comedy (Despite the presence of Nick Frost).  I came away with a favorable impression of Ms. Whitaker, and an enhanced impression of John Boyega, who had gotten a bit of fame earlier as Finn in The Force Awakens.

Overall, the plot of the movie is very insular and focused.  Alien creatures invade earth.  They're not presented as highly intelligent, rather mindless hunting and mating machines.  Thankfully, the movie doesn't go for body horror, but rather straightforward ""beast vs man"".  Boyega's Moses mugs Whitaker's Sam outside the housing block they both live in, and then things go to hell as alien creatures fall from the sky and start attacking, looking for the creature that came before them.

 We never really find out what happened outside of The Block, whether there was a large scale issue or not, but I find I didn't mind.  The care that the gangers have for each other, and their block is the focus of the story, and well done.

My wife was rather indifferent to the entire thing, however - the lower budget was a bit off-putting for her, though she did appreciate the alien visual effects, and both of us did have a bit of a problem with some of the (for us, being US residents) accents, but overall, I enjoyed it greatly.",1501113600,,1508,4.5036764705882355

And this was my FIFTH viewing over the years.

And I bought it today -- not rented it.

And I don't think I understand even 35% of the spoken lines despite my history, and it STILL DOES NOT MATTER IN THE LEAST.  The viewers always know what's afoot, and the pacing transports us seamlessly from scene to scene.  Acting was pure.  CGI was just good enough to make the aliens convincing, but as a viewer, I was not having any doubts about reality -- the acting, pacing, choreography, casting, script, and real-world ""block,"" owned me.  To survive this many viewings with such psychic traction, there has to be some sort of ""spell casting"" done by the allure of flawless excellence.  Gotta see this if you haven't.

6th viewing a half year from now.

4711046,5,B005J4TLN4,"""Attack the Block"" is an outstanding movie.

It's low budget British sci-fi comedy and it is basically state-of-the-art low budget sci-fi. Instead of going cheap atrocious cgi like you'd expect to see scouring the depths of Netflix they were actually smart enough to plan ahead so that they could write in a reason to make badass practical monsters supplemented by simple cgi. The dialogue was hard for me to follow at times, British urban slang just isn't a language I understand, but the important stuff made it through. John Boyega (yeah the dude from Star Wars) doesn't even speak much despite being the main character, which also ads to the coolness of the movie. It's also got Nick Frost, basically a staple of British sci-fi stoner comedy at this point.

Side note, it is crazy how similar Luke and Harry Treadaway look, at first I was stoked to see Dr. Frankenstein, then I was just awestruck that he seems to have a twin.

If you've seen this and liked it, you need to find Misfits, it used to be on Hulu for free, I'm not sure if it is anymore though.",1469577600,3,1061,4.544502617801047

4711062,5,B005J4TLN4,"This review is for the Blu-Ray version of 'Attack the Block.'

Five stars as far as I'm concerned. Sure the effects might be below par but this was totally unexpected.
When I saw 'Inner City vs Outer Space' ;I thought for sure this was a kid's movie. I never even checked to see that it was rated 'R'. I don't know how well this did in the box office or if it made money but they were taking a big risk making a movie like this and making it for adults.
I was very surprised right from the get go, especially when you see a bunch of kids (only a few that are white) mugging a white girl. This is not the sort of thing you see these days. Political correctness and all. But then again this is not an American film.

The movie itself is exactly what you would expect from the cover only a lot better. It's a movie about alien beings who come to earth. A group of kids, all from one city block, battle it out using their wits to fight the aliens. I can't give much in the way of details or it would ruin the movie.
I'm guessing John Boyega got his role in Star Wars due to this movie. He is the 'leader of the pack' so to speak.
There are plenty of funny moments. Part of the humor for me was listening to the English slang the kids were speaking. It's a lot different than what somebody from the United States would expect to hear.

Anyway, this movie it highly entertaining. You won't be bored. It movies along at a brisk pace.

4711064,5,B005J4TLN4,"I never write movie reviews, but Attack the Block holds a special place in my heart. I first watched it when it came out after seeing stills online. I was pretty sceptical, not generally a frequent viewer of alien movies. I think my last was Men in Black 2, back in the godless early 2000's. The premise is deceptively simple - aliens land in a council estate block (English public housing project) and are fought off by teens. John Boyega, who I didn't yet know through Star Wars, really shines in the role as Moses. His acting and the plot itself add a layer of complexity to an otherwise funny movie. Alex Esmail as Pest, Luke Treadaway as a 'gop-yah' type rich boy trying to look and sound cool as he comes to buy weed, Sammy Williams and Michael Ajao as Prop and Mayhem, and - really the entire cast are amazingly talented, funny and clever. This is a fun, funny and ultimately, weirdly poignant movie with a fresh take on 'urban youth culture' and a moral message that doesn't feel preachy so much as natural.",1463011200,2,1015,4.462365591397849

They promptly kill it and bring it to their cannabis dealer in the hope that it might be worth something.  That was their second big mistake that night.  The creature was not alone.  The rest that follow are bigger and toothier and quite putout.  And the poor nurse they robbed is later held hostage by this same crew.  She sticks with them though when they show a certain acumen for destruction and survival.

If director/writer Joe Cornish was trying for social commentary he picked the wrong approach.  You cant fight stereotypes using stereotypes that perpetuate a common conception.  The opening sequence made me cringe.
As for the claim that this sci-fi flick is a comedy...........I must have missed the humor.  But it is action packed and exciting and the monsters are appropriately creepy and vicious.

4711102,5,B005J4TLN4,"Every time I watch Attack the Block, I get a smile on my face.  This film about a scrappy bunch of kids in a disadvantaged neighborhood taking it to a bunch of invading aliens is a bit like The Goonies if it involved aliens and took place on the streets of London.  Hard to watch and not root for the gang.  It's a bit violent and has some stoner humor, sure, but what's smart about the film is that no one takes themselves too seriously.  It's a fun film that manages to not only look cool but pulls of cool on a limited budget and not beat you over the head with either a long run time or the point.  Well worth the watch to see John Boyega before he showed up in a certain science fiction film franchise.",1455235200,3,707,4.057553956834532

The trailer for the movie is in germany...which sounds a bit odd. The movie itself plays on region 1 blu ray player....but the other menus to the movie are inaccessible...and don't play.

Great character development (though do not expect it to go real deep) but the focus is on action. The aliens are well done and the storyline is coherent and actually quite funny. There is some blood and violence, along with swearing slang from South London, but no nudity or sexual references. This is just a fun, well produced movie.
Plot:  A group of teenage toughs from the projects in South London mug a nurse on her way home from work. As the mugging takes place a parked car near the is hit by something out of the sky. When the leader of the gang investigates he is attacked by a small alien creature that is then chased and killed by the group. They take the dead body back to the housing project to store in a local gangster's 'weed room'. Celebrating potential celebrity they look out a window from their location and see numerous falling lights. It seems that more aliens are arriving......from there the story moves into a high pace action film involving fights, chases, and the final realization of what is really going on and how to overcome it.

Now the lead is in Star Wars and I wish him the best.  He captivated me here as did the others.  There isn't a player that isn't unique in his or her own way.  Everyone stood out in my opinion.

This is the genre in its most undistilled, raw form - no fancy camera filters or gaudy post-production, just actors inside genuinely scary alien suits charging down smokey hallways at other terrified actors. There's also a touch of extremely relevant social commentary that doesn't turn dramatic or fatalistic, which keeps the realism of the film. One of my favourite sci-fi films.",1430179200,,455,5.422535211267606
4711186,2,B005J4TLN4,"I don't understand how this movie has so many positive comments.  It's quite bad, both in dialogue and in effects.  The movie centers around five losers who kill a female alien then are chased down by several male aliens.  The aliens themselves look like cheap CGI characters, a cross between a gorilla and the alien from the far superior Alien (Sigourney Weaver) movies.  The movie almost has a racist overtone.  All the black characters (and they take up most of the characters in the movie) are presented as street thugs: thieves, drug addicts, drug dealers, etc.  Do we really need another movie which features stereotypical black characters?  At one point the central character, Moses, presents a conspiracy government theory about the government creating the monster to ""rid the world"" of blacks.  Really?  It doesn't help matters that these characters live in what we call in America ghettos.  There is also an attempt to manipulate the audience into feeling sympathy for these bad kids by scenes of their apartments, as if that's an excuse for bad behavior.  None of the main central characters are likeable.  The movie opens with them mugging a young lady with a knife, then they discover she's a neighbor and force her into helping them by brandishing weapons (as a nurse in real life I laughed when Sam (the female character in question) informs one of the kids that was bitten by one of the aliens that his leg might be broken (first the cuts aren't deep enough and two he wouldn't be up walking around with a broken leg).  Even if you ignore all the above it's still a crappy alien movie.  It's shocking that this movie was produced by the people behind Shaun of the Dead.  Of course, the ending is just another hollywood cliche, so obvious the audience can see it a mile away.  This movie came and went quickly in 2011 and there is a good reason for it.  I was highly disappointed.  I give it two stars because it does heat up 3/4th of the way in but that's not saying much.  There are no real surprises and it's a shame the highly talented Nick Frost is completely wasted here.",1430006400,,2092,4.635869565217392

There was also a good moral message underpinning the whole thing, which is another thing missing from most entertainment today.

Some of the actors can be hard to understand with their inner city London accents. The acting outs yup notch however, and John Boyega shines as the lead character.

The aliens are not all that scary and this was more of a comedy than a horror movie. It was highly enjoyable.  Plenty of laughs and a story that is action packed and tense.

Mr. John Boyega was perfect for his role because he showed a well diverse of emotions. His heroism had me cheering for him all through-out the remainder of this quick witted Action /Adventure movie.

4711289,2,B005J4TLN4,"I don't know if this was just built up to much for me or what. I remember seeing the previews for this and getting excited. If I am not mistaking it was a pretty limited release and eventually hit red box, and even netflix. Somehow with all those opportunities I still waited until now.

A few of my coworkers really enjoy this movie and my expectations were maybe a lesser Shaun of the dead or hot fuzz. I felt it was less of that and honestly didn't offer too much for my liking. There were some funny parts and some pretty interesting ideas. Overall the story wasn't great, the acting wasn't great, and the funny parts were just too few. The best part of the movie was the fun British slang.

I love British gangster movies (snatch, lock stock, rock n rolla, long good friday, etc) because I love listening to the crazy British slang, but I also expect the movie to be good. I think this lacked a good story and relied on pretty lame ideas. The most frustrating was the lack of vehicles or real weapons. The only real weapon they ever used was a sword and they only used one. Also I hated the main bad guy... his focus didn't make sense and it didn't make sense for him to be mad at the boys...

Oh well overall ok story, impressive graphics considering the budget, but not really that impressive.",1407110400,2,1300,4.341563786008231
4711290,1,B005J4TLN4,"Attack The Block is flat out one of the worst alien movies ever made!  This movie could've been great, but it was ruined by bad acting and a storyline that isn't very good.  If you're going to make a movie in the dark of night then please don't make aliens so dark that they blend in with the background.  You can see them (not very well) and tell the difference, but it bugged me the entire time.  The green glow that comes from their mouth is kind of cool looking, but that's it.  If you see an alien would you get your buddies together and try to take them out?  I'd say ""No!""  Forget calling the cops, this little group of thugs who are neighbors think they can do better with fireworks, a sword, and a bat.  I don't recommend this movie to anybody.  Lastly, if you're buying this because you're like me and saw Nick Frost is in it, think again.  Nick is in the movie for only about 5 minutes and maybe says 20 words that don't even make you laugh.

I like how the characters and relationships evolve during the movie.  The movie has elements of action, horror, sci-fi, drama, and even a smidge of romance.

4711306,4,B005J4TLN4,"I really enjoyed this movie and I think its just the sheer fun of it that got my attention. The film is violent, funny, dramatic, touching, and a must see simply put. I wondered how they managed to make a film about a British comedy/Alien action adventure work, but then again since its from the producers of Shaun of the Dead (another fantastic British comedy) I guess I should have expected to like this film as well. What makes it even more impressive is that this was Director Joe Cornish's debut film! A feat that deserves respect for what he and everyone else managed to do for this movie.

 A friend of mine actually saw this movie before I did and he insisted I check it out since I am a fan of action comedies. I took it home and held off for a while to be honest in checking it out. When I finally did and started watching it I was stunned to see just how much time had passed and before I knew it the film had ended. If you are trying to find something new to see and just wanna laugh at the same time as enjoy a rollicking roller coaster, this is the film for you!

Attack the Block is about a group of young teenagers in London who (surprisingly) are on the front lines of an alien invasion that just happen to center on the apartment complex (the Block) that they live in. Fighting for their lives they must battle up and down almost ever floor, all the while trying to figure out what their enemy is exactly and why they are attacking them.

The characters are all well done, believable, and ones that you can relate to, which really matter in a film. They have their strength and weaknesses each, but they band together to fight the invaders, all of it inspirational. What I really enjoyed about the film is the fast paced style; the action picks up rather quickly and it isn't long before you are caught up in the story. Though it is violent and action packed the film also does offer enough sensitivity to root of the characters and each of their motivations.

Bottom line, this film is excellent. If you enjoy the British comedies; Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, At World's End or other action adventure comedies, please check this one out! You won't regret it, theres a reason it has such a high score on Rotten Tomatoes; people love this film! So go and check it out, I hope you enjoy it!",1401840000,2,2307,4.306451612903226

4711308,3,B005J4TLN4,I liked the movie but felt more work was needed on the script.  The acting was a mixed bag with some good performances and some subpar.  In regards to the aliens I was somewhat disappointed. They just weren't that scary and being that they could easily be killed with a knife or sword really only posed a threat when attacking in numbers.  With those shortcomings I still liked the move and thought it a good effort for being a low budget flick.,1398816000,,445,4.402439024390244

The creatures were all cheap cgi when they were moving but it's actually worse when their not moving because then they look like actors in very very cheap bear costumes. I can not convey how bad these costumes were, and even then the mouths were still cheap cgi.

It's gets worse! These bear sized creatures are held at bay by things like brooms and ice skates. And they can bite open a motorcycle helmet one minute but barely bite into a kids leg the next minute or tear up an armored police wagon one minute but have problems breaking a wooden door or fighting a kid the next minute.

I could write a lot about this movie but I'll keep it down to two main points.

The first - this could totally be a comic book. After watching Sin City - I love a good movie with classic Comic Book scenes. Don't know what I'm talking about? Watch the movie and you'll see.

The second - it's CLEAN. Well, sort of. There's no sleazy scenes or gorey gut-ripping-spilling-out scenes. Sure, there's a moderate level of cussing which I was more than happy to overlook. SO REFRESHING!

Overall it's a great movie to watch on a Friday night - it's got some hilarious moments, and really great scenes shot. Most of all it has a true-to-heart moments. Oh yeah, don't expect these kids to spill out sad sob stories - their kids living with what they've got and you'll definitely notice that.",1392076800,,1050,4.396907216494846

There were only two nearly mid-Atlantic accents in the bunch so it was a bit difficult to follow some of the actual dialogue but I casually ignored that to watch these kids battle drug dealers and phosphorent-fanged aliens.  It didn't follow the usual formula in some instances and even in the ""killing"" scenes there was relatively little blood and gore. The British restraint at work? Nevertheless, it's a nice diversion from the usual alien horror, with a few tongue-in-cheek scenes here and there (Victims caught in an elevator with an alien...who'll walk out? Victim hides in recycling dumpster which the aliens can't break into.) The ending is rather abrupt but again, that goes against the usual outline,  and considering the kids accomplish what they set out to do, perhaps it's just as well. I don't think I've ever seen a horror film featuring young Brits before (or am I missing out here?) so perhaps this is a new film genre waiting to be plumbed?

It's up to this cocky gang of cockney hoodlums to make a heroic stand, defend their turf and send the evil ET's packing.

THOUGHTS: I wasn't sure what to expect when a friend at work recommended this to me. It turned out to be a lot of fun! The thick accents make it sort of hard to understand at times, (turning on the subtitles helps tremendously), but even so the visuals make things fairly easy to follow, even if some of the nuance is choked under heavy cockney slang. Then again young kids seem to have a language all their own regardless of what country they live in, don't they? Good F/X, brisk pacing and solid action highlight this film. Laughs & scares in the long tradition of such classics as Ghostbusters and An American Werewolf In London.

It never came - granted a few dropped off but these were the kids that had a glimmer of hope of redemption. The ones you want to die horribly, survive. I liked the creatures - they were new and different and that was what I was looking for. The rest of the movie was a complete waste of time listening to kids trying to be tough, trash talking to bad rap music and painful accents.
There is no character growth, no support for the characters even though this takes place in a city, it's contrived and so full of stereotypes that it is painful to watch.

4711369,2,B005J4TLN4,"If you're tired of movies that have protagonists with no redeeming qualities, stay away from this one. It's very hard to relate to - or even like - the main group of characters. ""Attack the Block"" starts with a gang of young thugs mugging a lady who turns out to be one of their neighbours.  Then, when the trouble hits, they bully her into helping them.  Sadly, their behaviour doesn't get any better as the movie goes along.

The script tries to push moments of empathy on its audience by showing us the home life of these little jerks, as if to excuse their bad behaviour.  Those ""poor me"" moments irritated me.  We can't blame other people or circumstances for the choices we make, yet that is exactly what this movie wants us to do.  Sorry, but being raised by a grandparent or living in a low-income area doesn't give anyone a free pass to be a criminal.

Even the clichd and obvious ending was meant to manipulate the viewer into feeling better about the ""hero"" being such a worthless creep; ""Ahh well, he wasn't all bad.  He sacrificed himself to save the world!""  I was so turned off by these little punks - er, protagonists - that I didn't remember any of their names throughout the movie and was glad to see most of them get wiped out by the aliens.

This movie is an enjoyable action sci-fi movie.  The movie sets up a premise of an alien invasion, and adds some twists to keep it interesting.  One is that the aliens aren't the normal advanced science aliens that would normally be expected to have invaded earth but are rather more animal like.  Another is that the first to recognize the invasion is a group (gang) of kids.

This film also avoids one of the more annoying problems that that plague sci-fi shows and films.  Characters knowing things that they really shouldn't have any idea about given their background.

The characterization is really quite good for a sci-fi film.  Unlike many where the characters are assigned names, professions, and wait to be slaughtered. This movie attempts to provide some sort of back story for each of the characters.  This however doesn't make them likeable, as I ended up rooting the ""hero's"" while still disliking them.  I feel that this adds to the film.  It makes the characters more human rather than just cardboard stand-ins until they're needed for the shredder.

The story ends at an appropriate point where the kids are no longer going to be involved.  This still leaves a bunch of questions, but at least the part of the story you're watching is complete.",1374105600,,1458,4.73015873015873
4711372,5,B005J4TLN4,"A young nurse is walking home at night when she's set upon by a gang of masked and hooded delinquents that demand that she give up her phone and wallet. Things look as though they're about to turn ugly when the mugging is interrupted by a large unidentified object falling from the sky and crashing into a car right next to them.

You'd be forgiven for assuming what happens next: the nice white lady rushes back to her apartment block and rallies her neighbors together for the imminent alien attack, whilst the teenage hoodlums are quickly dispatched as the first victims of the invasion to demonstrate just what the monsters from outer space are capable of. Well, you'd be wrong.

Sam (the nurse) makes a run for it, while the teenagers do exactly what you'd expect teenage delinquents to do in this situation: investigate the car, disturb the strange creature that lurks inside, and then bash it to death with cricket bats. They head back home with their trophy to store it in Ron's weed room (the local marijuana grower) only to watch from his apartment window as more aliens begin to crash land about the block. The arrivals go unnoticed by the police due to it being the fourth of July, and the boys eagerly head out to kill some more aliens. But a short montage in which they hurry into their apartments to gather weapons and briefly interact with their families belies the opening mugging sequence: that for all their bluster and swagger, these guys are still just kids.

Heading back out onto the streets, it soon becomes clear that this new wave of aliens don't go down as easily as the first one. As black as hairy shadows with rows of glow-in-the-dark teeth and the speed and strength of simians (the kids coin the term ""big alien wolf gorilla mother******s""), the aliens are terrifying opponents that quickly accrue a bloody body count.

Taking refuge in the council block and running back into Sam (who is still shaken by the mugging) they try to come up with a plan and defend themselves against the aliens that seem to be coming after them in particular. Winding in and out of the narrative are several other characters to help or hinder them: a pot-smoking college student, a drug-dealing criminal, a couple of nine year olds who insist on being called Props and Mayhem, a group of teenage girls who are easily the most intelligent characters in the film, and Nick Frost in a small role (with the best lines) as Ron.

The young cast is impressive, particularly as most of them seem to be complete unknowns. Choosing to cast actual teenagers instead of twenty-something year olds makes all the difference in keeping the protagonists fresh and genuine, as does using the idiosyncratic speech patterns and slang prevalent in lower-south London. John Boyega as Moses, the gang leader, is especially good - starting as a drug-dealer-in-training but concluding his character-arc by facing up to what he's done and risking his own life to set things right. Towards the end of the film he partakes in a phone conversation with Sam that reveals a particularly poignant detail to his life.

A really nice touch is the fact that the progression of his character is marked by Moses's interaction with Sam. And by ""interaction"" I mean several moments in which they simply stare at each other - first with fear and hostility, and eventually with respect and trust. Each gets the chance to save the other over the course of the film, and by the time the credits roll you can tell they've reached a level of understanding that only a life-threatening situation could have ever granted them.

Joe Cornish (writer and director) takes plenty of risks in a low-budget sci-fi/horror that actually has something surprisingly profound to say about its subject matter. Glancing over some of the one-star reviews, it would appear that a few viewers took offense at the idea of hoodlums being cast as the ""heroes"" of the film, a viewpoint that (to me at least) seems to miss the point spectacularly. Yes, the opening scene in which Moses and his cohorts mug Sam isn't easy to watch or forgive - and the film doesn't expect us to. Sam remains furious with them over the crime throughout the course of the story, and the teenagers' female friends give them plenty of flak for it as well. Yet having demonstrated that the mugging is just one ugly aspect of their characters, Cornish goes on to force the teens to face up to the consequences of their actions. Not all of them make it through the night, and those that are left are clearly in a heap of trouble by the time the credits roll.

He's also to be commended for the creative reasoning behind the alien invasion. I won't give it away, as a mystery is sustained over the course of the film as to why they seem to be targeting the gang, but it's a unique take on a familiar trope, and the low quality effects of the aliens themselves mean that Cornish resorts to camera techniques that prevent the audience from getting a good look - which has the advantage of making them all the more scary.

The best part is the snappy dialogue, which is heightened immeasurably by the actors' performances. Whether it's Pest hypocritically chiding Sam on her potty mouth or Dimples matter-of-factly listing her reasons as to why she's not letting the boys in the flat or Biggz leaving a series of near-hysterical messages on voicemail, the fast pacing and naturalistic delivery makes it almost a necessity to watch a second time just to catch it all.  Plenty of gritty action sequences, quick pacing, dark humour, and plenty of surprises - it's not for everyone, but I loved ""Attack the Block.""",1373587200,,5625,4.701522842639594

4711375,3,B005J4TLN4,"A classic plot line in American Westerns is the ""defend your land"" scenario where a small group (usually a family) needs to fight against some outsiders (be they bloodthirsty Apaches or rival ranchers or a vengeful gang of criminals) who want to muscle in. The plot has been used again and again in many genres. One recent entry is Joe Cornish's Attack the Block, a science fiction alien invasion version of the story.

Set in south London, the story begins with a gang of young hoodies who mug a woman on Guy Fawkes Night (which explains the fireworks in the sky). They get interrupted by something crashing down from the sky that's not a firework. The object wrecks a car. The head hoodie, a boy named Moses, investigates the car and discovers some kind of wolf/dog monster who scratches him up. Moses and his posse hunt down the creature. After they kill it, they realize it must be some alien and they think they can cash in if they find some interested scientist or TV program. So they head to the safest spot they know, the local drug dealer's ""weed room,"" where he grows marijuana. They run into Hi-Hatz, the sadistic drug lord for the neighborhood. Hi-Hatz recruits Moses to sell for him, giving Moses a small amount of drugs. The boys have bigger problems when more alien creatures come crashing down and threaten the 'hood.

The movie is standard B-movie fare--the creatures are scary but not too scary; the comedy is okay but not great; bigger issues (in this case racism) are touched on but not dealt with in depth. The story keeps viewers engaged because the characters are more like real people than like stereotypes or archetypes (though the aliens are pretty one-dimensional). Even though the gang is very unsympathetic at the beginning, they show a lot more of their humanity and vulnerability as the story goes on.

The woman they mugged is an ongoing character. When she is reunited with the gang through circumstance, their interactions are real and they come to understand each other better. This plot line provides a center to the movie that keeps it from being too cliched or too formulaic or too uninteresting. The realness of the relationships raises this to the high end of the B-movie category.",1370563200,,2221,4.748704663212435

Here you have the South England version of E.T. meets The Goonies, but the kids here are street thugs and the aliens are eating people indiscriminately.  Overall it was a fun watch. Just trying to decipher the kids' cockney/south end jargon is a treat in itself. The story opens on a gang of street kids accosting a woman on her way back to her flat. First impression is that these kids are mindless ghetto rats, but they grow on you quickly when a meteorite smashes into the car next to them during the robbery and their leader Moses goes to investigate.  He is attacked by something in the car and the group chases the creature to a shed (ala E.T.) where they dispatch it and proceed to carry it around. It's an alien of course, and after that the adventure begins when a whole slew of gorilla/wolf mother****ers as well as a crazed drug dealer and plenty of armed police coming after them. Dark and gruesome at times.  Touching here and there. Funny at others.  In the end you will have found yourself having a good time watching it.  From the makers of Shaun Of The Dead, if that mean anything to you.  Definitely worth a peek, but you had better bring your cockney dictionary ,because they don't slow down the dialogue for one second.

4711387,4,B005J4TLN4,"Even if you can't wrap your ears around the ""Souf Wondin"" (South London) accents spoken by the actors like they have marbles in their mouths, then don't worry. There is plenty of good action and nice interplay between all the actors here.

Just in case you're wondering why all the action occurs around a singular apartment building and not the entire ""block,"" it's a Britglish. The block refers to that building known as a tower block (think the projects on the South Side of Chicago and you'll get the picture).

Anyway, the creatures are terrifying as rabid aliens. The kids are first-rate in their ability to band together and defend their block. There is also a terrific social commentary on the state of Britain snuck in based on the interplay between the police and the kids. Also, be forewarned the start of the movie which contains no aliens is a pretty sinister mugging that you wonder if you've got the right movie.

The extras are worth getting the DVD for. There's a full hour on the making of the movie and it's beyond terrific. There's a full four more extras thrown in as well on the movie including a reason why a huge chunk was not filmed at all after being storyboarded and location scouted.",1365206400,,1210,4.618604651162791

4711406,2,B005J4TLN4,"This is a pretty disappointing film.  Horror movies especially low budget cheesy ones, work because there are characters you want to see killed, and characters you root for to make it to the end.  None of the characters who need to get their comeuppance in this one do.  You've got a gang of cowardly teens who not only surround and attack a nurse while she walks home as group, but threaten her with a knife so she'll take off her wedding ring which they can pocket along her phone and purse.  Good, can't wait to see these pathetic lowlifes die in the next couple of minutes you're thinking.  But alas they don't.  Then in their minds a firework destroys a car and the leader of this group of cowards decides to loot the vehicle for anything valuable.  Then when again in his mind a terrified dog bites him and runs off he yells out lets go get it and f it up, and the cowards chase after it cornering the frightened creature stabbing and bashing it to death.  This absolute scum of the earth have to about to die you think, but again nope.  Spoiler alert - in fact most of these evil little psychopaths never do.

Most of the people who do are good guys such as two cops who compassionately keep talking to the victim of these thugs' violent assault and robbery while they patrol the streets and apprehend two of her attackers.  There was no point satisfactory wise for the audience in killing these two.  These were obviously hard working nice cops who wanted to make the streets safe for those that lived there.  They weren't corrupt or bullies or anything to make you feel some satisfaction when they were killed.  Then the gang of thugs feel nothing for these brave men who died joking how stupid they are to leave keys in the van.

The point is you absolutely hated these kids, and there is no point in that for a horror film when they are the ones going up against something trying to kill them unless you can enjoy seeing them killed off one by one. I'm not claiming the kids did a bad acting job, I have no idea about that, I've never seen them in anything else, but the point is there characters were badly written to be what they were by the script writers.  With no good humans to root for, except the nurse, you've got no alternative but to root for the aliens and are pretty disappointed that they don't kill many of the thugs.  At least if the thugs learnt something from the whole experience you could have that but no, the white British kid trying to be a black American gang member sums it up with a the world owes me whatever I want reply. Why can't he help local kids he whines, when the nurse explained her husband is doing humanitarian work for children living in poverty in Africa. At the very least if they tried to defend the block of apartments and those inside they may have had some redeeming quality by the end of the film but all they were interested in was themselves and fighting (after they discovered it wasn't going to be easy like the one at the start of the film) the aliens to save themselves.

I didn't mind the fact the aliens were pretty much giant stuffed gorillas with glowing blue teeth. I like cheesy low budget monsters.  But their intelligence level wasn't consistent, somehow they could travel light years through space but can't work out how to lift the lid on a dumpster.

Nick Frost pretty much has not much more than a cameo in this film which is also disappointing especially when this film is being marketed by comparing it to Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz.  I never really bought that any of these kids were poor enough to be able to claim the world isn't fair that's why we are who we are and do what we do.  Their council flats were a lot bigger than these things are in real life South London.

4711413,5,B005J4TLN4,"If you are a lover of independent, low budget movies, like me, then you will love this one.  It is billed as a black comedy but some people seem to mistake this for a comedy.  It is not Shaun of the Dead, it is a fairly serious movie with some underlying humour throughout.  It's main message is quite sad with underage boys having to fend for themselves because they have been forgotten and abandoned by their families.  The lead male has the attitude of a much older man despite being only a boy but he has not had an easy life and has had to fend for himself for most of his life.  You can almost understand how he got into crime and being a young thug and can even empathise with him.

The aliens are hilarious and look like evil Furbies but I guess this is because of the low budget.  Don't let the bad aliens ruin the movie though as the story is not changed.  In fact, I don't think this movie would have worked so well had it been shot with a bigger budget.

I am from Britain and have spent a lot of time working in and around London but even I struggled to understand the broad London accents at times.  However, the accents added to my enjoyment of the movie as it gave it an element of reality but I think your average American watcher will struggle to understand them.

I sure hope that this film reaches the mainstream, because it's not only a great Halloween movie, but one of the most entertaining films I've seen in a good while. Aliens versus a bunch of rag-tag crew of British teenagers. Works for me.

IF YOU SEE THIS FOR NO OTHER REASON, see it for the unique villain/alien. It reminded me of something that I might see in an old Jim Henson film, but this thing doesn't play around.

I have seen it in standard definition and in Blu-Ray form. I can't say that there is an incredibly marked difference, but if you are a purist and want that extra stretch of beautiful, it's there. If you already enjoy the film and you are wondering how much better the aliens come through in high-def, you can tell a little bit of a difference, I believe.

I would not be surprised if, in about 10 years or so (or less), we get a new batch of directors that heap praise over this film and state how much it influenced them and enticed them into getting into the film industry---to make films like these.

To say I was disappointed would be an exaggeration but I wasn't bowled over either. The film isn't especially funny, and it certainly isn't scary, but it is charming and heart-warming (in a grisly sort of way). Cornish's love of Hollywood creature movies is evident and transposes nicely to the decidedly un-glamourous setting of a south London tower block. The largely unknown cast perform well and are utterly convincing (the patois is the funniest aspect of the film) and the low-budget effects mesh with the overall tone of the piece.

And I do enjoy the fact that films set in England cannot automatically rely on GUNS for all of the killing action. When the kids scatter to their apartments to get armed for the fight...........in the US they'd have assault weapons or at least a variety of hand guns. Here they must rely on baseball bats, swords, chains, gas filled (spoiler alert) super soakers, knives & yes, a few hand guns. The aliens were creepy & surreal -- like shaggy puppies with wicked fangs. And unlike most Alien movies, these critters are vulnerable & not that bright. Good at mindless killing but stoppable. I was surprised at the level of tension that was created in the various face-offs between monsters & kids, monsters & adults, kids and other badder kids, cops & everyone else. The opening sequence drags along too much but it sets the stage for the rest of the action. An interesting shout out to PBS style Nature shows too. Funny that. I did have a bit of a struggle with the cockney accent.........say what?!  But after awhile the dialogue wasn't really needed to enjoy the action. So really.....3 1/2 Stars overall.

This ""R"" rated alien infestation (it has a very small and temporal scope so ""invasion"" doesn't quite fit) flick makes use of some striking visuals (pitch black man-apes with big mouths that glow like neon blue Colgate toothpaste) and is a slice of modern life around an upscale tenement housing project (nicknamed ""the block"") that focuses on a group of young hoodlums with (to our American ears) thick British accents that are hard to decipher much of the time.  The main characters, the young thugs, aren't endearing at all; practically no one in the movie is with the exception of the sympathetic nurse that gets robbed by them early on and then needs to stick with them to stay alive.  Quirky but fairly one-dimensional characters abound and by movies end life goes on as usual so it feels like nothing terribly significant has happened.

4711425,1,B005J4TLN4,"Shaun of the Dead is one of my favourite movies, so I was excited when I saw the connection with this film. I was even more excited when I saw the ratings from professional reviewers. When the movie started I had some misgivings but I was willing to give it a chance. About a quarter of the way in I was wondering when the comedy was going to kick in. It never did.

I don't mind the fact that the heroes in the film are thugs and hoodlums at the start. I don't mind that the aliens look like someone's tried to make their childhood soft-toy collection look scary. I understand this is a low-budget film and the acting and camera work are all fine. What I do mind is that the storyline goes nowhere, it's extremely cliched and predictable, there is no character growth, the one-liners are not funny, and the boys from the block are really just crude stereotypes at the end of the day.

Pros:
-The direction and cinemtography are spot on, this is a very well made film.
-The creature design is great, it utilizes the CGI pretty well.
-The action sequences are entertaining and well shot.

Cons:
-The main characters are thugs, I hated them right off the bat. Though they do become a bit more likable as the film chugs along, but not by much.

Like I said, it hits more than it misses. This movie would be great if the kids were more likeable, (Comparisons to this gang being like the Goonies is laughable.) but as it is I want to slap all of them and tell them to quit acting the fool.

The pacing and direction; however, more than make up for this, and ultimately there is fun to be had while watching this movie. I'd say give it a rental before buying.",1345766400,2,963,4.333333333333333
4711427,5,B005J4TLN4,"Attack the Block is one of the best movies I've seen this year. Though it is very much its own movie, I can't help but draw a comparison to Shaun of the Dead. Not because it is also set in the UK, but more because the films are sort of mirror images of each other. Where ""Shaun"" is a comedy with action and horror elements, though, ""Attack"" is primarily a horror and action movie with comedy elements.

Rookie director Joe Cornish learned well from Edgar Wright though, because aside from keeping the action down to only what is necessary to tell the story, he also allows the film to slow down at a couple points. Just enough to allow his film to have actual characters, with substance and dimension, not just pointless action-guy schlock. It's refreshing to see these things in any movie released today, since so much has become recycled, rebooted, remade, or sequalized, but especially so for a first film.

And speaking of refreshing, the acting in ""Attack"" is superb, despite the shoestring budget. John Boyega as the film's lead is exceptional, and I look forward to seeing him rip through future roles. He has serious talent. The supporting cast is all golden though, even though I was familiar only with Nick Frost prior to seeing the film.

For an American like myself, giving advice to fellow Americans, I will say this: You're going to miss things, and some dialog is just not going to make sense, because for the most part we aren't exposed to British slang. I have some friends in the UK, and though I wasn't familiar with many of the expressions, if you keep them in mind from the beginning as you hear them, you won't have any trouble understanding what the slang or expressions mean. And I take exception to a reviewer saying we'd need to have subtitles for an American version or that this might as well be in a foreign language for all we'd not understand. That's just juvenile.

Attack the Block is definitely worth watching if you have any level of interest in science fiction, horror, or action movies. The dialog isn't pandering to non-native audiences (which I appreciated, the alternative would have felt dumbed-down and phony), the acting is top notch, the score is excellent and well-implemented, and at 88 minutes, the film doesn't drag or get bogged down in pointless action. Overall it's a great way to spend an hour and a half.",1345334400,3,2357,4.672289156626506
4711428,2,B005J4TLN4,"The acting, directing, and special effects weren't bad at all. But that doesn't make a story. The script is partly a rip off elements of better movies, and partly just not well crafted.
The main characters start out the movie by mugging a local girl. Just because they are bored kids. Now, in the hands of Stanly Kubrick, this could turn into an awesome movie. But, unfortunately, it doesn't. That is supposed to be largely overlooked, as they become ""heroes"" just because they fight back against the alien invaders that are trying to kill them. Shallow, barely detailed alien invaders that look like a combination of Critters and something more werewolf like. Dragging the girl they mugged back into it, some of them get injured. Their drug dealer flips, goes off his rocker, and eventually starts just randomly shooting at everything. The posse of dimwitted ghetto girls they pick up at the last minute are full of cliches. At they first are upset, then start calling them heroes. All of this might work better if the movie was seriously shot, but it's run as a tongue in cheek comedy the whole time, and just doesn't work.",1344297600,5,1125,4.744897959183674

4711434,4,B005J4TLN4,"A ragtag gang of young street punks living in South London council flats must fight a horde of hostile space aliens with big shining teeth. That's all you have to enjoy ""Attack the Black,"" a UK sci-fi horror comedy written and directed by Joe Cornish (his feature debut).

The fast-paced film opens with a gang of teenagers led by Moses (John Boyega). They are not very nice people as the first thing they do in the story is mugging a nurse Sam (Jodie Whittaker). But when an alien invasion starts with a strange object falling from the sky, the unlikely heroes, armed with a ninja sword and firecrackers, have to fight the creatures and protect the Block.

The director's long-time friend and collaborator Nick Frost (""Hot Fuzz"" ""Paul"") appears as Ron, a drug dealer, but the film belongs to the young players who did very good jobs. The film' story unfolds like that of a John Carpenter film at its best, with the director's visual flair and confident narrative. The space aliens are depicted as ferocious creatures throughout, and this idea works effectively in this genre-merging movie, where no one is safe.

Some viewers may want more laughs while others may want more scares. I for one liked the film for what it is, a character-driven action about the protagonist Moses, who changes himself into a real hero. ""Attack the Block"" is a hugely entertaining ride.",1342137600,,1366,4.779661016949152

4711436,4,B005J4TLN4,"Some have said this is like ""Goonies"" meets ""Gremlins"" and that is true only in the broadest sense.

Here's the scoop. A young woman lives in a part of London peppered with low income housing. She is robbed at the hands of a local, teenage gang. Suddenly, the neighborhood is set upon by some mean aliens plummeting down from the skies. The boys manage to kill one which ticks the other aliens off to no end. So they are going to wreck some major havoc and try to kill pretty much anything that moves. Our female victim tags along with her tormentors to hopefully survive the situation and maybe even make things square. The authorities enter the fray to get pretty much everything wrong.

Unlike the above mentioned films, this has no cute kids as heroes. These guys, though maybe not as tough as they think they are, have much more street savvy. They aren't out to survive the situation. They're out to prevail. Moses (played by John Boyega) is the leader of the gang. Yes he's tough, but you come to realize he's in a struggle to exist in a tough society. Sam (played by Jodie Whittaker) gets to see that Moses is not the one-dimensional evil-doer he he makes himself out to be. The rest of the crew are cool and funny, but not the cutesy funny of ""Goonies"" or ""Gremlins."" They display street humor born of poor education and misinformation. It's satisfying to see Moses live up to his name as he goes through a transformation that gives him a reason to feel good about himself.

The aliens are cool. The situations are cool. The music is fitting and you like the characters. I do wish the authorities weren't so constantly wrong. I mean, at some point, you have to believe your eyes and leave denial behind, but it's a minor quibble compared to the overall enjoyment of watching this film.

I was worried that this might be a one time view, but I can easily see sitting through it again (and probably again). Is it a great film? No. But it's better entertainment than many of its kind.",1341964800,,1989,4.486187845303867

4711441,5,B005J4TLN4,"Most alien invasion films are about government agencies or suburbanites defending their home against extraterrestrials with a combination of pluck, luck, and firepower. ""Attack the Block"" is how the 99% handles it.

The invasion takes place on the British equivalent of Fourth of July known as Guy Fawkes Night or Bonfire Night.  The exploding fireworks ensure all manner of mischief goes unnoticed, which is how nurse Sam (Jodie Whittaker) gets mugged by a gang of punks: Pest (Alex Esmail), Dennis (Franz Drameh), Jerome (Leeon Jones), Biggz (Simon Howard), and their leader Moses (John Boyega). After terrorizing Sam, the gang's attack is interrupted by an object smashing into a nearby vehicle.  Sam flees while Moses investigates, only to discover that a ferocious, hairless monkey-like alien is inside. After killing it, they take it to the local drug lord Hi-Hatz (Jumayn Hunter) and his minion Ron (Nick Frost).

It turns out that the flat where Sam lives is also home to the gang, a fact that becomes important later as they discover that the alien invasion consists of far worse things than little hairless monkeys. The special effects behind the aliens is simplistic but terrifyingly effective - they're basically stunt men in pitch-black gorilla-like suits with glow-in-the-dark teeth.  That's it. Fur with teeth.  You forget how inculcated we've become by the endless churn of big budget films that use subpar CGI to convince us aliens are really present in a film until you see three of these things barreling down on Moses.

""Attack the Block"" is an unflinchingly graphic look at gang life.  The gang members are children who swear, do drugs, and brandish weapons.  And yes, some of these kids are going to die.  The violence is also tempered by humor that only kids can provide, nimbly switching from fighting for their lives to gasping in child-like wonder at the awesome thought of going after what they alternately call Gollums, Gremlins, Pokemon, or monkeys. It's hard to imagine this film being made in the U.S.

If ""Attack the Block"" only had interesting aliens it would be a passable sci-fi film, but the plot elevates the movie above the usual pablum by keeping class struggles front and center.  When Sam is forced to ally with Moses gang, they turn from predators to protectors.  When each sees how the other half lives, they come to realize the sad set of circumstances that caused their paths to collide. When Moses points out that his gang would never have mugged Sam if they'd known she lived in their flat, she ferociously tears down the macho-construct of territory and ownership. ""Attack the Block"" doesn't set out to create world peace, but it's never afraid to let us know that we're as much responsible for our own plight as any alien threat.

And that's what makes ""Attack the Block"" great.  Block by city block, it spotlights our own class warfare by introducing a new, lower class: aliens.",1339632000,,2928,4.946938775510204

It wasn't what I would call the absolute best movie I've ever seen, but it was definitely better than average I thought, and it by no means sucked.  It was a fun new sci-fi horror comedy that was rather unique.  Nick Frost didn't play the biggest role in it, but for the parts he was in it, he was pretty good...his usual goofy funny self.  The stuff he does with Simon Pegg (i.e. Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, Paul, Adventures of Tin Tin, etc) will always be my favorite though, of either actor, though they have been good in everything else I've seen each of them in.  I was not real familiar with the other actors in this movie, but they all did a really good job I thought, even the 2 kids.

Well, it is a comedy after all, when it decides it is, but then again sometimes it's a morality tale about how misunderstood these sweet young criminals are, despite their willingness to attack a young lady five on one with masks on and knives out. Poor guys! So misunderstood, innit?

But then the fake-looking alien apes show up, and much hilarity ensues. And a few deaths. But, whatever. There's a few good jokes, a little suspense, and everybody realizes what heroes these guys really are, robbing girls at knifepoint notwithstanding.

Not to mention the one and only Nick Frost (wait, wait, with long hair? That's different) who goes on the sideline to let newcomers have a shot at shining. And shine they definitely do.
A gang of English teens attack and rob a young woman and, in the process, witness something ruin a car a few yards away from them. That something turning out to be an alien, and not a friendly one in the slightest. But not entirely the most formidable, either. After ridding it, there comes a mini-invasion of more creatures.

Only not everyone believes they're aliens, which adds to the crazy brand of humor only the English can truly do effectively.
A gang of teens, a young woman who's graduated a nurse, a couple potheads, not to mention a hardcore gangster who's rather opinionated, but nonetheless, all the ingredients add up to very crazy good sci-fi/comedy flick.

4711450,5,B005J4TLN4,"Attack the Block, like Drive, tops my list of best 2011 movies. The director, Joe Cornish, and most of his cast might be new to movies, but Attack the Block is brisk and assured. There's no padding to this socially-aware monster movie.

The eponymous block is a council estate - think projects - in South London, where Moses (John Boyega) and his four friends live. Attack the Block opens when they mug Sam (Jodie Whittaker), a young nurse who recently moved into the block. Immediately after a dog-sized creature falls from the sky and the boys easily kill it. Both of these actions have repercussions that last throughout the movie.

You see, that wasn't the only alien to come to Earth - and the others aren't so easy to kill. I love the monster design in Attack the Block. It's a low-budget movie, but being able to see nothing of the creature but a glowing mouth is extremely effective. If you're concerned about watching a horror film, Attack the Block is neither gory nor super scary. There are some effective shocks and a few violent kills, but that's not the true focus of the movie.

Most of the attention is given to the humor and the setting. Attack the Block is produced by the same people as Shaun of the Dead, after all. Whenever things get too tense, there's a Brewis (Luke Treadaway) scene to lighten the atmosphere. (Brewis is a rich kid who went to buy weed for a party at the wrong time.) The girls who act as a counterpart to Moses's gang are also delightful. The dialogue, almost entirely in the chav vernacular, is pretty easy to pick up and helps the block feel fully realized.

I think a council estate is a wonderful setting for a horror movie.  It's claustrophobic but still allows for movement.  (Chase scenes are essential.  Attack the Block has some great ones.)  The balance between the gang and Sam shifts throughout the movie but it never feels like the story is trying to have its cake and eat it too.  There's more to the gang than violence, but Sam doesn't have to forgive them just because they had their reasons.  What Moses, Pest, Biggz, Dennis, and Jerome did was wrong and Attack the Block never pretends it wasn't.  It just acknowledges people can do good things and bad things.  Thugs can care about and protect their home.

Actions have consequences and those consequences can make for a terrific movie.",1335484800,,2347,4.599520383693045

The characters were pretty much all likable,even though some do overact. The alien designs, while simple, are really good. Their entire bodies are black which allows them to hide in the darkness which creates paranoia since they blend in so well with the darkness of night, the only thing you will ever see of them are their glowing mouths when they go to take a bite out of you.

The movie had enough comedy to keep us entertained, while stopping short of being a comedy. There are brief moments of irony and juxtaposition to lets us know the writer and director aren't complete idiots. While the movie makes for a great independent, some of the acting and lines seemed a bit forced. I think a couple of early scenes with a little background on the main characters could have added to the movie and created something to build on, i.e. give us a glimpse of some future saving event.

4711455,4,B005J4TLN4,"""Attack the Block"" is a nifty little trifle of a movie with some emotional heft to it thanks to performances by a bunch of new faces and some surprising charm.

 Others have criticized some of the protagonists as thugs.  They left out how those characters become more and more well-rounded as the movie goes on,  which is one of the movie's chief charms.

 Simply put, the alien invasion is extremely localized and effects the inhabitants of one council estate in south London.  As the characters first discover and fight the aliens,  we learn more about all of them,  and get our pants charmed off us, thanks to the cast of mostly unknowns.  That the movie didn't stick to literal black and white characterization is a bone of contention for some,  because some of the reviews dismissed the characters based on the first five minutes of the film, and ignored the rest of the movie, which served as a kind of atonement as they join forces and change alliances.

 I'd characterize it as mostly comedy with a bit of sci fi thrown in for fun,  with some often sharp little observations tossed in sneakily as the movie takes off. ""Oh, he's in Ghana, is it? Why can't he help the children of Britain? Not exotic enough? Not going to get a tan?""  You can miss a lot of little details at the movie's breakneck pace,  but on rewatching the film loses none of its freshness.

 There's a lot of bad language for people who care about that kind of thing,  and a standout in cast member John Boyega,  who's a real find.  I've seen him in at least one British TV show where he proved his surprisingly layered performance here was no fluke; he knocked that one out of the park as well.  The only real familiar face here is the guy who played Ed in Shaun of the Dead, another comic/horror hybrid that was delightfully novel.

4711457,5,B005J4TLN4,"When you've seen as many movies as I have it's rare that one surprises you, which takes you off guard and delivers on the hype that surrounds it. But that's just what happened this week with the release of ATTACK THE BLOCK.

The story takes place in a London building project where low income people live in a high rise apartment complex doing the best they can. Among the tenants is a young woman named Sam who is mugged as the film opens by a group of early teens. This gang of sorts begins to take her belongings when a meteor falls from the sky and crashes into a car on the street.

Sam makes her getaway with this distraction and gang leader Moses takes a closer look. What he finds inside the car is a small creature with grey skin and sharp claws that takes a swipe at him and runs. The gang follows it and after shooting a few fireworks it's way, kills the creature.

Unsure of what they've got on hand they decide it's something they can make money off of selling pictures to some tabloid magazine. The safest place they can think of to hide this discovery is in the complex on the block at the apartment of the local drug dealer. All seems fine until the gang looks out the window to see numerous other meteors landing in the neighborhood. It appears this is a full fledged invasion and these kids aren't about to let their block be taken over.

Things begin to change when they witness the first creatures to come out of these meteors though. Rather than the tiny grey skinned being these are fully grown monsters. As the kids describe them they seem like gorilla alien wolf-like things. Yes that's an apt description but worse. The fur covered creatures are an incredibly dark black but present a wide oral opening filled with green glowing teeth. Not only that they're fast too.

Moses is picked up by the police who've been driving around with Sam trying to find the gang. After he's handcuffed and tossed in back, the police are attacked and eaten by the aliens who then try to get inside their van. With a little help, Sam and Moses escape and head for the rest of the gang.

Now it's on as the gang decides to take on these creatures. Unable to decide if it's just an invasion or if it's something the government has come up with to exterminate the people in the block, they arm themselves with whatever weapons they have and set out to defend the block.

The movie offers a nice blend of humor, suspense and sheer terror as the aliens chase the kids up and down the streets and in the apartment complex. This is a night when not everyone will make it out alive and one can only hope their favorite characters live.

There's the set up but it doesn't do justice to how good this movie truly is. The photography is fantastic, never making things so dark that you can't tell what's going on or see anything happening. Well lit by street lamps and headlights the creatures are clearly visible rather than the usual thing that happens these days with creatures rarely seen. Here they're quite visible and on screen enough that you get to completely enjoy them.

Being able to see the creatures makes this movie. They are at both scary on one hand and interesting to see on the other. You don't want to look away, you want to see them and see them often. Fortunately the film's director agrees and offers plenty of them to watch.

The movie doesn't try and pretend to be a serious take on an alien invasion. Instead it goes full out to offer an entertaining look at what might happen if aliens decided to invade the wrong neighborhood. There are plenty of chills and thrills from beginning to end.

As I said at the start it's rare for me to find a movie that surprises me or leaves me completely entertained. This movie does the trick. As the end credits rolled and had I had the time I felt like I could have watched it all over again right there and then. It will take a prominent space on my shelf. While most folks will be rushing to watch CAPTAIN AMERICA this week, I would recommend that you track this one down instead.

Loves: A good, under the radar action flick.
Likes: British movies
Dislikes: Most sci-fi
Hates: Hard to understand accents

Attack The Block was a film from early 2011 that slipped under my radar. I had heard buzz growing about the internet, but never had the chance to watch it. When it came to the end of the year lists, I saw it pop up on several, which made my interest grow even more, so naturally, I finally took the time to hunt down my copy.

Attack The Block centers around a group of thugs in a London neighborhood who are front and center when an alien invasion of sorts hits town. The action is tense and the creature design is really cool in a 'less is more' way. I loved the direction of this movie and the pace never lets up. It has a lot of 'edge of your seat' moments. Yes, it's got it's problems (which I will highlight below), and Nick Frost doesn't have much to do, but I had a ton of fun watching it. You just have to get past...the accents. The thick British accents are very 'working class' and a lot of the slang and dialog had me scratching my head. It didn't effect the story at all - that's pretty straightforward - but I'm sure I missed some tidbits along the way.

Attack The Block is one fun time at the movies. If you like movies like District 9 or (to a lesser extent) Super 8, see this immediately.

Movie revolves around a bunch of British Youth Thugs and a soon to be British Nurse.
And their apartment complex. And a Alien Species from out space.
This movie is very MODERN. Very REALISTIC, in words and also in they way the actors dress.
And funny thing is I usually can't understand what British people are saying, but this movie will have you
so engrossed in whats going on u will hear every word and laugh and feel the moments in the movie.
The music in this FILM is just amazing, just as amazing as how imaginative the Alien creatures look, I mean really when you
think about ALIENS from outtaspace could look like anything. And it so works for the Apartment complex the film takes place at.
My favorite movies are TRON LEGACY and TERMINATOR 1  but this movie lol is funny but has so much action it has to be on my list as my 3rd favorite movie of all time. I like how the film has a feeling of us versus them.
There is even two little kid actors in it who have great lines.
WHAT A MOVIE !!! RENT THIS cuz when u do you will want to BUY it.
Man I think if the Britain/London could do what CANADA has done with their MUSIC talent, they could maybe be big competition for HOLLYWOOD, cuz I always see lots of good British actors in Hollywood films/TV.
Anywayz this movie is dope if u love HIPHOP or even if you HATE it. This movie has a way of bridging that gap somewhat.",1330387200,,1479,4.135416666666667
4711463,5,B005J4TLN4,"Go see this film.

For a film featuring a parade of debutants - the main actors are all feature film novices, as is the director Joe Cornish - this is an assured performance indeed. Assured in the craft with which it has been put together, and assured in the confidence it has in its own identity as a piece of real south London life (despite principally concerning and invasion of blind, luminous-toothed alien gorillas!) I say ""south London"" because this unendingly fascinating city is like anyone else's country, and Attack the Block captures the badlands south of the river the same way as Nick Frost and Simon Pegg's Crouch End zombie movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shaun-of-the-Dead/dp/1848566786/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shaun of the Dead</a>&nbsp;captures the north. They're very different places.

For my money (and notwithstanding I live around the corner from the Crouch End high street) Attack the Block is by far the superior film. In any case, it makes no compromises for American audiences: for this to have a show in the US it will need subtitles. Perhaps they could release it as an Art-House movie and call it a foreign language.

Every facet is skilfully crafted. Cornish's direction is witty and imaginative but most of all exquisitely paced: whenever things promise to get out of control (and when your subject is alien invasion, invariably they must) Cornish pulls everything back from the brink and re-injects some banter to calm things down and re-prime. The banter is all delivered in that odd Brixton patois that will be completely unintelligible to people who are over 25 or hail from outside the M25. The cinematography and camera work is neat, too: clever use of aerial shots and well handled chase scenes lead into superbly old fashioned approach to special effects: rather than flaunt the saccharine wonders of CGI, Cornish reduces his aliens to black balls of fur (like, so black you can't even see them - a touch Douglas Adams would be proud of) with luminous teeth. As directors used to do, Cornish and prefers lighting, cutting, music and the viewer's own inference over Pentium Processors to generate suspense. As a consequence, there is plenty.

Steven Price's score is impressive, is used with wit and verve, and Basement Jaxx (also feature film debutants) contribute a superb pulsing soundtrack.

Joe Cornish's screenplay is similarly assured. I did think he'd painted himself into a corner: once the luminous-toothed gorillas had arrived en masse there was no obvious resolution other than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Braindead/dp/B00006RHU4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Braindead</a>&nbsp;style mayhem with a lawnmower, but Cornish expertly pulled in a seemingly incidental sequence early in the film to set the film on its path to resolution. No lawnmowers required.

But most impressive is the acting: the ensemble case of amateur kids is flat out brilliant and each times his lines to the nanosecond. The professionals complement them without ever grandstanding (Nick Frost is admirably restrained in a supporting role) and Luke Treadaway, dealing with a peach of a role as a try-hard posh kid buying his weed from the estate in his dad's Volvo, nails his role. Treadaway's expressions, pacing and delivery are worth the price of admission alone. Or would be, were the price of admission not already fully covered by the performance of John Boyega as Moses. Boy has this young fellow got Charisma to burn: If Boyega sticks at it, he is destined for big things: a smouldering, brooding, enigmatic presence: you read it here first.

Lastly, Attack the Block respectfully tips its hat without ever being derivative. The block is called Wyndham House. Cornish cites the influence of 1980s ""alien"" movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/E-T-The-Extra-Terrestrial/dp/B0009UCEV4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">E.T. - The Extra Terrestrial</a>. It has had some effect: the kids trawl round the estate on their bikes like a sort of dark inversion of Elliot's pals. They mug people, sell drugs, and when they discover an alien they don't befriend it: they kick its head in.

An all-round treat, therefore: by turns Attack the Block will have you laughing, wincing, on the edge of your seat, and jumping three feet out of it: the shocks are doozies, in a knowing sort of way: you know you're about to get a fright (in that unlucky-Alf-casually-meandering-up-to-an-open-manhole sort of a way) but when it comes, as you know it will, it jazzes you all the same.

I loved this film. In an oasis of formulaic, cheap-shot lazy drama, this is a thoroughly welcome return to honest, old fashioned film craft, with no particular compromises in the name of commercial success.

It kind of depends on whether you like rooting for lowlifes or not.  If you do, then Attack The Block is a pretty fast-paced film with shallow, but often funny characters.  The aliens are shown with a kind of minimalist approach--all you really see is fur and teeth, loud, chomping (and yes, glow-in-the-dark!)teeth.  Now, if you are the person who has to have their main character believable and sympathetic, this film might drag a little slower for you, as there is very little nobility on the leads' respective parts.  Their actions, save for one oddly non sequitur altruistic move at the end of the film, are almost as feral and self-motivated as the canined aliens they get pitted against.  Also, if you are annoyed by spuriousness, wait until you see the leap in logic one of the characters makes to guess the motivations of the aliens.  I'm sure the agent representing the writer(s) for this film probably earned his/her money shopping this around.

4711467,4,B005J4TLN4,"When the producers who brought you the horror comedy ""Shawn of the Dead"" are involved, you can expect the unexpected. I had a great time watching this clever, creative mashup of urban gang movie and alien invasion thriller, something no one to my knowledge has tried before. It's an auspicious debut by writer-director Joe Cornish and leading man John Boyega.

""Attack the Block"" is full of kinetic action, complex characters, amusing dialog, and interesting twists on two genres. Set among the gritty council flats and lower classes of Britain, the film features a band of thugs as protagonists. They behave viciously at first, mugging a nurse in the opening scene, yet she eventually becomes an ally after aliens attack the tower block they share. The hoods evolve into a group that demonstrates ingenuity, bravery, loyalty, and even a kind of nobility in the face of common threats, human and nonhuman.

The talented young cast, most of them complete novices, is thoroughly believable (the only actor you're likely to recognize is Nick Frost, who plays a comical pot grower). Their thick South London dialect and slang may prompt American audiences to turn on subtitles, but that won't interfere with your enjoyment. The furry, jet-black aliens, while not particularly sophisticated as special effects go, are implacably aggressive and genuinely scary as they leap on their victims and tear at them with glowing blue fangs. And what's an alien invasion without a good dose of grisly horror?

A caution: If you order this item from an Amazon Marketplace reseller, you're likely to be shipped a bare-bones rental disc that contains the film and a few trailers but none of the worthwhile special features. Be sure to enquire before ordering whether the DVD on offer includes the bonus material. If so, the extras will be listed on the back cover of the case.

There are three different commentary tracks from the director, producer, and actors, as well as ""Behind the Block,"" an hour-long making-of documentary, and ""Creature Feature,"" a 20-minute look at creating the aliens. Throw in a variety of shorts like ""Meet the Gang,"" focusing on the young actors, and ""Unfilmed Action,"" showing storyboards for scenes never filmed due to budget and time constraints, and you have a very full disc. All told, these features are considerably longer than the film itself and will substantially augment your viewing experience.

When I saw that other people on Amazon had rated this film only one star, I thought for sure their main complaint would be that they had trouble understanding the dialogue because of the accents and unusual slang. The fact that they are instead calling the cast of the film unlikable and wanting them dead I believe says more about their nature as people than it does about the film, that they can't find sympathy for a group of children living in poverty, abandoned by the system and at times their families, banding together to survive in a tough neighborhood.",1327190400,4,999,4.612359550561798

Well if you haven't before, you have now. The 2011 low budget sci-fi, horror film 'Attack the Block' will surprise you at every turn. You'll start out hating the main characters, a bunch of arrogant teenage thugs terrorizing the streets of a rundown south London neighborhood, but when a bunch of hairy apelike aliens with florescent fangs land in the area you'll find yourself quickly won over by their courage and bravado. When these guys talk about protecting the block they mean it.

While the cast is, as already mentioned a group of newcomers, they do a commendable job making this rather outlandish plot come across as believable and exciting. The lead role of Moses is played by a young Denzel Washington look-a-like named John Boyega who turned out to be impressive in a rather understated way. Boyegas' slow transformation from unlikeable hoodlum to intelligent anti-hero is wonderfully subtle and supplies an excellent counterbalance to the fast paced, helter skelter plot and action sequences. Definitely a surprising little film with an absolutely killer ending. I have a strong feeling this one will become a cult classic.",1325030400,5,1282,5.018779342723005
4711483,4,B005J4TLN4,"A surprisingly enjoyable flick. Obviously it's played for and to a very specific audience - and in many respects, a far cry from the general appeal of its advertised production lineage which includes 'Shaun Of The Dead' and 'Hot Fuzz'.

Clearly geared toward the simmering youth markets of various downtrodden cities and townships; I imagine there might be some additional interest among Anglophiles in general. Although I would guess much less Merchant-Ivory territory. <g>

In many ways this production reminded me of the classic anti-hero flicks '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Warriors/dp/B000A6T1JU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Warriors</a>' from 1979 and '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/New-Jack-City/dp/B0009VBTFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">New Jack City</a>' from 1991. Ugly and scary subcultures that the mainstream ignored, but that independent flicks discovered; helping to establish deep cult followings amongst inner city kids of the time. And like those films, 'Block' follows a group of young thugs, criminals, and general misanthropic knuckleheads.

However unappealing the lead characters, there's a sympathetic resonance in their performance. One that, in my opinion, draws heavily from another scifi classic, '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blob/dp/B00004W3HE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blob</a>' with a very young Steve McQueen. And just like that early film, 'Block' is less about the monster or monsters and more about restless youth and their misplaced energies; a sense that given a challenge - young ones can step up, do right, and save the day.

It's an interesting and controversial notion that has its promoters and detractors alike. Suffice to say that, in the context of this flick, I found entertaining.

Kudos to young actor John Boyega, he impressed not only as an action star, but as a budding dramatist. And perhaps it was my eyes only, but I could swear this could be Denzel Washington's kid - amazing resemblance. Looking forward to seeing more from him.

Loved that the director chose to go partly old school with the monsters - getting tired of the plastic unreality of CGI. Sometimes a rubber monster propped by talented puppeteers can be more 'real' and therefore more enjoyable.

Overall, a very decent rental that should slowly build a growing cult/fan base.",1325030400,2,2432,6.093567251461988

I mean seriously, in terms of fulfilling the roles of a bunch of punk kids trying to be all tough and thug-like, they did a good enough job to make me not like the very much. And for them to become the eventual protagonists of the story and not the happy little nurse character does make for a bit of a shift for any audience member.

But don't worry, the aliens totally make up for it. They're wonderfully visual with their luminescent teeth set against their pitch black bodies - seriously awesome look. And what's funny is that for the most part it's obvious that they're guys in what are practically gorilla suits - but the contrast of the green glow versus the rest of their bodies is just awesome. Throw in some classic horror movie blood and gore effects and you're pretty much set.

What makes the movie work is how it combines elements from your classic alien invasion kind of movie with the sensibilities of a zombie apocalypse or survival horror flick. I'm really impressed with how Cornish managed to create that kind of a mood for the movie without having it dip too far into being overly scary or brooding. Thus it maintains a weird humorous undercurrent to things without going too far into the realm of slapstick or something.

The whole movie is visually impressive - you'd never think that it was produced with a budget of approximately $13 million. The shots were generally well done, the action nicely intense and the aliens fairly scary all throughout. It doesn't pretend to be a more complicated story than it is - so you just get good entertainment as the crew try to kill the aliens before they get killed in turn.",1324771200,3,1681,4.541254125412541

4711490,5,B005J4TLN4,"Have you ever wondered why in sci-fi alien films, aliens tend to come in contact with young boys, military soldiers or a man or woman who ends up helping them in the end?

Especially with alien infestation films, we always tend to see a perspective from either a family, government or military.  But what if an alien happened to come into contact with a gang in South London?  A troublesome gang from the block?

That is the concept of the British alien infestation sci-fi action film with a great balance of horror and comedy featuring the directorial debut of from writer/actor Joe Cornish (""The Adventures of Tin Tin"", ""The Adam and Joe Show"") and a film from Nira Park and James Wilson, producers of ""Shaun of the Dead"".

And if there is one thing that can be said about ""Attack the Block"", it's a unique action film that has received primarily positive reviews from the critics and became a hit in the UK.  Although having a limited theatrical release in the United States (as US distributors worried about the South London accents of the cast), with the rave reviews the film has received, it's become one of the most highly anticipated Blu-rays for the fall season.  And now, ""Attack the Block"" makes its way to Blu-ray courtesy of Sony Pictures Home Entertainment.

VIDEO:

""Attack the Block"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (2:40:1).  While the film is shot during the night, outdoors, inside a building, etc.  The film manages to have plenty of detail thanks to good lighting and careful cinematography courtesy of the talented Thomas Townend (""Ratcatcher"", ""Pride & Prejudice"", ""Morvern Callar"").  Closes up of the faces of the characters showcase the really good makeup in depicting the scar that Moses gets from the first creature.  Closeups also showcase the details on a person's face, the blood splatters and more.

I detected no banding, artifacts, edge enhancement or DNR.  Colors looked vibrant (especially that glow from the alien's teeth) and black levels were nice and deep.  ""Attack the Block"" looks magnificent on Blu!

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Attack the Block"" is presented in English and French 5.1 DTS HD-MA.  Let me just say that despite this feeling being a low-budget film, when it comes to audio, this film doesn't sound low budget at all!  The lossless soundtrack is fantastic!  From the opening fireworks that envelop the sky to the aliens crashing into the cars or hearing their jaws as they try to take a bite of Moses and the gang to the various gun shots, explosions and fireworks that are employed throughout the film, especially with its hip hop soundtrack, ""Attack the Block"" is an immersive film!

There is plenty of action, from the aliens crashing into things while chasing the teenagers, the sounds of fireworks to the hip-hop bass-bumping music soundtrack and the music by Steven Price, ""Attack the Block"" sounds wonderful on Blu-ray!

Subtitles are presented in English, English SDH and French.

JUDGMENT CALL:

I have only heard the hype about this film and until I finally sat down and watched this film for myself, I can see why so many have raved about it.

The first thing I did after watching this film is go to Facebook and Google+ to rave about how awesome ""Attack the Block"" is because the whole concept, the whole entire film based on a gang trying to survive an alien onslaught is rather fun and exciting to watch.

And you have to give credit for the film's efficacy to Joe Cornish.  The writer/actor makes is filmmaking debut with ""Attack the Block"" and with him calling the shots, the first thing he asks for is not having actors trying to act like they are from South London, you have to find people who are from the troubled streets to make this film come alive.

And what you have is a group of older teenagers who know how to talk smack, teenagers who seem like they are the real thing and most of all, making you feel the film is authentic.  And Cornish, no matter how many takes it took to make the scene work, his dedication to capturing the authenticity of people living in South London was impressive, realistic and lends to the enjoyability of this film.

Many have described the film to ""Goonies"" but Goonies for the modern era.  And I can see the comparisons but one thing that makes this film so unique aside from its multiple use of slang is that in this film, none of the kids will be spared to the end.  Some will live, some will die but there is no happy ending in the sunset.

And while ""Attack the Block"" is a sci-fi, action adventure type of film, there is also a message that goes into the crime that takes place in South London.  Almost, similar to a film such as ""Boyz n the Hood"" which goes into the politics of having people kill themselves in the hood, ""Attack the Block"" also makes the statement as these kids feel that no one is going to help them.  If the Block is going to be attacked and they are going to be killed by aliens, does it matter to anyone?  They are the poor, their location is where drug deals take place, people live miserably and now, they have a new danger that can kill them off but does anyone give a damn?

Suffice to say, when we understand the living conditions that these people live in, we become sympathetic, especially as these group of teenagers do what they can to protect their block.

Meanwhile, filmmaker Joe Cornish knows how to use comedy in a film that could very much be a dark ""Goonies meets the Warriors meets Predator"" in South London.  Comedy is the key to the enjoyment of this film and while you expect talent like Nick Frost (""Hot Fuzz"", ""Paul"" and ""Shaun of the Dead"") to earn laughs, the surprise star is young Alex Esmail as Pest, and there is no doubt in my mind that we are going to see more of this young actor in the near future.

Meanwhile, I also have to commend actor John Boyega for playing the stoic leader Moses (and is it me or does Boyega look like a young Denzel?).  Not bad for a young actor who discovered the audition for this film online and then eventually getting the part for the lead character role!

If anything, it's the characters that make ""Attack the Block"" an enjoyable film.  The aliens, we know they are there...they look ugly, they'll thrash anything in their way but instead of focusing on the actual fear of trying to allude the aliens, Cornish was able to develop a character-driven screenplay in which everyone has their part in the film.  From the five gang members, Sam the nurse and even the drug dealers or drug buyer.  Everyone has a a chance to partake in the chaotic nature of the film but to accomplish it with a low budget, for the most part, I'm quite impressed.

And as far as the Blu-ray is concerned, this is one hell of a release!  You get three audio commentary (and because Joe Cornish is a big fan of them, he makes sure to avoid the pitfalls of kitschy commentary by making sure dialogue is kept up throughout the film), an intriguing video diary of the making of the film from pre-production through the completion of filming and more. And the picture and audio quality of this release is fantastic!  If anything, this is one heck of a solid Blu-ray release and fans of the film will definitely be appreciative of the overall release.

It's a shame that ""Attack the Block"" only received limited distribution in theaters in America, personally I don't think that the slang and South London accents affected my understanding of the film as it was easy to follow.  Sure, it could have had more scares but I found myself laughing and was literally captivated by the film from beginning to end.  And as far as the alien infestation goes, due to the success of the film, I get a feeling that it's not all over and we may see more of Moses, Pest and possibly Sam in the near future.  At least, I hope so!

""Attack the Block"" is highly recommended!",1323993600,3,9554,4.668062200956938
4711491,4,B005J4TLN4,"I have been awaiting this one for a while.  It was very much worth the wait!  ""Attack the Block"" is a nice little piece of science fiction with a nice twist on alien invasion.

A nurse on her way home is accosted by a gang of local youths.  She is robbed, but during the robbery something crashes into a parked car.  The gang witnesses this strange ""bald monkey"" and corners it.  I suppose as a right of manhood they have decided they are going to kill it.  Little do they know, they have just killed a female alien who has come to breed.  Her pheramones are now all over the gang, and all her ""boyfriends"" are now in hot pursuit.  It is now a duel to the death between the protagonist (Moses), his gang, and the creatures.

""Attack the Block"" was a very refreshing take on ""Alien""--not as savage, but still a lot of fun.  All the actors (and the majority of them are young men), are very believable in their roles.  When they find out their first robbery victim lives ""in the block,"" they now decided to defend her.  In fact, they tell her if they had known where she lived, they wouldn't have bothered her in the first place!

The movie has an 88 minute run time and is rated R for language and some violence.  It was written and directed by Joe Cornish.  I did not care all that much for the male creatures because they were CGI creations. Although they could be brutal, their ""scream"" was more menacing.  On a side note:  I would advise that you turn on the English subtitles.  The ""gang slang"" and heavy cockney accents were hard to decipher and understand.

4711501,4,B005J4TLN4,"Months later, my first vivid memory when someone mentions ATTACK THE BLOCK is of how it generated more good buzz than COWBOYS & ALIENS, another sci-fi feature which shared the same box office debut date, stateside (July 29, 2011). Except that COWBOYS & ALIENS lacked what ATTACK THE BLOCK brought to the table: a certain vitality, a sense of suspense, and an exuberant young cast that's years away from being jaded. So, yeah, if you're expecting loads of Nick Frost in this picture, be aware now that he's in only for several cameo appearances, what amounts to pretty much a supporting role. And, word to the wise, unlike previous films featuring Nick Frost, this one isn't a spoofy film. Or not blatantly anyway. Director Joe Cornish opts for a more straight-up sci-fi action thriller. With good bits of comedy. But characters fall victim to alien predations and there are moments of icky blood-letting and gore. Which to me are strong selling points.

ATTACK THE BLOCK pits a crew of teenaged hoods against a localized alien invasion. The film's skimpy budget couldn't at all afford epic. In South London, on Guy Fawkes Night, as lights and sparklers festoon the atmosphere, Moses and and his street gang go about the business of mischief. A nurse named Sam (Jodie Whittaker), who lives in the neighborhood, is their latest victim, to the tune of a mugging. But then a meteorite hurtles down to earth, smashing onto a nearby automobile and so Sam, she makes her getaway.

I guess you can blame the ringleader Moses (John Boyega, memorable). Moses is stoic and intense and not afraid to take matters into his own hands. He ends up offing an extraterrestrial - because in sci-fi films, chances are good that meteorites are actually vehicles for space aliens. Moses's action ushers in the plummeting of more meteorites, and true to sci-fi trope, more alien creatures emerge, this time a pack of jet black, furry monsters. These predatory things, exhibiting cruel bioluminescent fangs and an aura of sheer menace, evince a marked lacked of intelligence, as demonstrated by one creature's sheer inability to open a friggin' dumpster. It's actually rather sweet that our ""heroes,"" witnessing these meteorites descending onto their South London housing projects, get all excited about killing off more aliens.

Director Joe Cornish purposely introduces these disenfranchised inner city youths to look as threatening as possible. The kids are fully hooded up and masked, silhouetted in shadow, ominous. Every suburban yuppie's nightmare. As the story progresses, we see the kids remove their layers, and we get a peek into their personalities and individual ticks. It's nothing new, but Cornish frames these characters really well and the kid actors are lively and likable, once the masks come off. And when the chips are down, they don't hesitate to stand together, to protect their block. And they go about this armed with baseball bats and samurai swords and near-cryptic South London slang. Doesn't anyone just say ""Crikey!"" anymore?

COWBOYS & ALIENS, with its mega-budget, doesn't come close to being as watchable as ATTACK THE BLOCK which goes to show that, sometimes, you really hone in on what's important when limited to meager resources. The film makes do with generous application of practical effects and by opting for a big bad alien that's conducive to cutting cost. And, yeah, the film could've been funnier. It could've been scarier. But this film didn't intend to be another SHAUN OF THE DEAD. It's its own entity and comes with its own sense of dynamism. Cornish infuses the screen with smarts and heart and lots of energy, abetted by cinematographer Thomas Townend's vivid imagery and Basement Jaxx's throbbing score. And the kids, again, lend their own vibrancy and great enthusiasm; their interactions are highlight scenes for me. This is some refreshing take on ye olde space alien invasion, with attitude to burn and urban jungle ethics and braggadocio on full exhibit. Er, not that I condone folks getting mugged or pants being worn so low that your crack shows.

4711503,4,B005J4TLN4,"What a totally fun and refreshing version of the same old the alien monsters are attacking us genre. The ""heroes"" are an unlikely bunch of teenage thugs in a rough part of south London. No one messes with them--not even the faceless aliens with glowing mouths.
I really enjoyed the different take on the alien invasion story.

Our teenage hoodlums attack a young lady as she is walking home down a dark street. They surround and terrify her as they demand money. It's a scary scene--even one's worst fear--but things take a turn for the worse. The mugging is interrupted by an old explosion next to them. No one is prepared for what just arrived next to them.

Although it is a night full of fireworks, some of those balls of lights falling to earth are not fireworks. It's a good set-up. The aliens are landing during fireworks. They aliens are landing in small individual vehicles but why in this part of London? It eventually becomes clear that are actually attacking one large building - council block (or rather a large apartment building for mostly low income people). It gets even more specific as it becomes clear the aliens are all after our group of teenager hoodlums. The reason becomes clear later but the build up is great fun.

The young cast members all play their roles with delight. We even get insight into their backgrounds and home lives. The cast of unknown actors is fantastic. They add a total realism to the film. These kids have to find a way to save themselves and hopefully the whole planet.

Note to the monsters from outerspace. No one messes with these kids!",1321833600,2,1588,4.640569395017794
4711504,3,B005J4TLN4,"ATTACK THE BLOCK is certainly different than many alien invasion films.  Director Joe Cornish displays a keen sense of gritty realism and elicits good performances from his young cast.  The accents are pretty thick so careful attention needs to be paid to the fast-paced dialogue.
The creatures are pretty unique, with their glowing teeth and quick movements.
The film obviously has a message and social commentary on how ""bad"" kids given the right break can become heroes.  These kids are certainly bad as evidenced in the opening scene where they rob our heroine at knifepoint.  I found it difficult to cheer them on since you can bet after they conquer the aliens they'll go right back to their gangsta lives.
At any rate, the movie is slick and energetic, probably finding a teen audience more in tune with its rebellious heroes.  But hey, I was young once too!",1320883200,,865,4.8175675675675675

Produced by some of the same folks who brought audiences Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz, Attack the Block centers on a gang of street kids living on a council estate who take it upon themselves to face off against an invading alien species that has crash landed in their hood. Impeccably stylish and full of wit, I enjoyed the hell out of it and marked first-time director Joe Cornish as one to watch.

As absurd as it looks on the surface, it quickly takes on a sense of believability as the very solid characters are introduced. They are three dimensional and evolve in the course of the film.

The neighborhood seems real, gritty and violent. The bad guys who become heroic are actually bad, not misunderstood.

The creatures are oddly believable, well designed and reasonably motivated. They are animals behaving like animals and able to die like animals, not super human aliens or zombies. Terry Notary (choreographer, movement coach: creature movement, etc.), who has been involved with many big budget movies, injects and extra degree of reality to these shark mouth, wolfy gorilla looking predators. Love the teeth.

The film is nicely spiced with a little social commentary, satire, stoner comedy, neighborhood dynamics and lots of fun.

For those who care, there is some gore but more often implied, as with splashes of blood from off camera.

4711510,5,B005J4TLN4,"Joe Cornish's ATTACK THE BLOCK is a great alien invasion film that isn't really about aliens at all.  Sure, it's got aliens.  But it's about the kids - it's about anger and rage and disappointment and what it feels like to grow up disenfranchised and disrespected and lost and hopeless.  Fifteen-year-old Moses is bitter and looks much older than he really is.  He lives alone with his ne'er-do-well uncle in a ghetto neighborhood in London.  He and his hoodie friends roam the streets attacking innocent passersby, talking trash, and hiding from the cops.  We don't like Moses or his friends - they reminded me of Alex and his ""droogs"" in Kubric's ""Clockwork Orange.""  But as the film progresses we come to suspect that Moses is a product of the world in which he lives.  ""Actions have consequences,"" Joe Cornish tells us in this film.  Moses's decision to attack a young woman named Sam and his decision to track and kill a strange creature that slashes his face have consequences - and those consequences are horrible.  But at the same time, Moses himself is seen as the consequence of so many other people's actions - his uncle who is ""here and there"" but mostly missing; the police who seem clueless and incompetent; the adults who should be role models but who are selling drugs or shooting up the place.  We don't like Moses, but we come to understand him.  And actor John Boyega is amazing playing this young man.  He's anger personified, but there's so much more there under the surface.  Boyega's eyes alone communicate a world of emotion and experience.

All that said, I must admit that the aliens themselves are a bit disappointing.  We see very little of the first alien until it's dead, and even then we never get a good look at it (I didn't mind that so much - in fact Cornish might have been wise to follow this same plan for the rest of the film as well).  The second wave of aliens, however, presents more of a problem for me.  The aliens honestly look like the grass creature things from Shyamalan's ""Lady in the Water"" (""Scrunts"" - sort of big shaggy bear-like creatures with lots of teeth).  This is not a good thing.  I know this is a low-budget film, so special effects will be limited, but these creatures just don't say ""aliens"" to me.  They were scary and strange, but I couldn't quite see them as traveling through space.

But since I really don't think this movie is about the aliens, I can't complain too much about how they actually look (and maybe Cornish's point is that ""aliens"" come in many forms and attack from many directions).  ATTACK THE BLOCK is an extremely exciting movie about the struggle to remain human in the face of attacks from all sides (and it's not an easy struggle).  By the time we get to the film's climax, Moses is no longer the angry fifteen-year-old hoodlum we see in that opening scene. He's changed, and so have we as viewers.

Haha, if you've ever been with your crew talking junk about what you'd do if aliens came down, then this movie's for you! I can't give more details without giving away the twists and stuff, but wow[...]

Definitely worth buying and putting on the shelf!

Anyone giving it less than a 4 is a dumb%ss b/c this movie's the business. KEEP IN MIND IT'S STRAIGHT TO DVD so don't expect a 40 million dollar project. But I tell you what, if it got a sequel or soemthing, this should go to the movies!!

Great movie that just didn't get the proper channels to make it to the movies, but it's gonna be a cult classic!!!",1320192000,,783,4.312925170068027

4711515,4,B005J4TLN4,I rented this movie to see if it was something that I might be interested in buying. My family LOVES this movie..I don't really know what it is but I like it too,1320105600,,161,3.909090909090909
4711516,2,B005J4TLN4,"So my wife and I were wandering around the movie store looking for something fun for Halloween.  The guy at the counter suggested this movie and he usually has pretty good recommendations, so we gave it a shot.  Described as an old school B-movie about kids defending their block from an alien invasion, this sounded like it could be good.  Add in Nick Frost and the producers of Shaun of the Dead and it sounded like an obvious winner.  My wife and I appreciate a return to kid hero movies like Goonies and the recent Super 8, and thought this might be a lower budget, funnier, British take on the genre.

For the most part, all of this was true.  The plot was great b-movie fare, the special effects were low budget but more than adequate, and the concept pretty good.  So what's not to like?

Absolutely despicable characters that we never warmed to at all.  Nick Frost was fine, but was hardly in the movie.  The stoner kid and nurse were also pretty decent, but the rest of the children, about whom the movie was really about, were all a bunch of hateful little bastards.  From the opening scene where they rob a woman at knifepoint, to their constant disregard for any law enforcement, these children all needed a good spanking and a few years in a reform school.  I understand that England has an over the top police state and that youth are sometimes abused by the ""nanny-state"" and anti-social laws that unfairly target the youth.  However, watching a movie like this makes me almost sympathize with the police.  I was actually hoping most of the kids would get eaten by the end of the movie.  I kept hoping that the movie would eventually show some of the redeeming qualities of the kids, but it just didn't happen.  So Moses gave the lady her ring back.  Nice.  What about her purse and phone?  What about the emotional distress of being robbed by a gang of punks at knife point?  How about the two police officers and multiple friends that were killed because Moses decided to brutally kill some ""dog"" because it bit him?  Doesn't England have Animal Control?  Added to all this was the constant anti-establishment, gimmie-gimmie mentality pervasive amongst these kids.  At one point, one of the kids asks the nurse why her husband is in Africa.  After she explains that he is working for the red cross helping children there, the kid replies, ""Oh, so he couldn't help the kids here in London?""  Huh.  How selfish of him.  Of course he should be helping the underprivileged punk rioters of London in one of the wealthiest nations in the world and ignore the millions of children in Africa living in tents without access to drinking water, food, and dying of aids.  How uncaring of him.

The only character that seemed half-way decent amongst the band of hoodlum thugs was the black kid with glasses, and he gets eaten early on.

Alas, this movie annoyed more than it entertained.  And don't get me wrong here; I can appreciate vulgar disenfranchised youth.  Super 8 had a lot of that too, and I thought that was a very enjoyable movie.  Super Bad and Bad Santa are some of my favorite movies too, so I'm not a prude.  These kids, however?  Repulsive little whiny punks.  Lock em' all up, throw away the key, and save your money for another film with likable characters.",1320105600,8,3281,4.577319587628866
4711517,3,B005J4TLN4,"As quirky a horror movie you're gonna find, it has blood & mayhem, laughs and gasps.
Nick Frost(Shaun of the Dead) is brilliant, you can definitely see the influence of the Edger Wright movies in here, (Wright was also a producer)...there's also a scene reminiscent of the first Die Hard movie...it's a kicker.

Kids with weapons on bikes and scooters, aliens who look like they walked out of a Tom Baker episode of Dr. Who, the anti-hero, Moses and a load of dangerous and funny blokes.
Not the funniest movie out there, but it is full of dark humour,if you like(d) Edger Wright's movies, you'll enjoy this movie",1320019200,2,613,4.675925925925926
4711518,5,B005J4TLN4,"I often enjoy genre movies like this in spite of the writing and acting, just because of some (hopefully) unique action sequences.  I seldom if ever watch movies like that more than once, though.  This one I want to own, because I expect to watch it again on my own and to show it to friends in the future.

This movie is very well-written, and it takes full advantage of the novel inner-city vs. aliens concept.  All of the characters are believable, and they respond to events in a way that feels like it comes from who they are rather than what the plot needs them to do.  Case in point: one of the main characters, a nurse, has to team up with a group of teenagers who mugged her at the beginning of the movie.  She does this because she has to, but she never just lets it slide that they committed a crime against her.  Most of the protagonists here are petty criminals who do unsympathetic things at times, but the movie gives them a chance to redeem themselves as characters without it seeming forced or schlocky.

I also like the fact that there are no throwaway characters here, even though some of them seem at first as if they're just there to set up a punchline or two.  By the climax of the movie, various elements click into place in a very satisfying way to make what happens next seem authentic.

Besides the writing, the other elements of this movie are also very polished.  The acting, the special effects, the camera work; even the soundtrack is memorable.  This is definitely worth at least a rental, and probably a buy as well.",1320019200,2,1548,4.411971830985915
4711519,4,B005J4TLN4,"This movie was in and out of a few theaters a month ago and made about $1 million.  Now it's already out on DVD/Blu-ray.  Produced by the same guys who came up with ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"", director Joe Cornish takes this story a bit more seriously without totally abandoning the humor.

Set in inner city south London, the film opens with a gang of teenagers mugging a nurse on her way home for the night.  Suddenly a meteor-like object falls from the sky.  While the nurse escapes her plight, the boys investigate the object which has hit a car.  They discover a hairless creature with a mouth full of razor sharp teeth.  They manage to kill the monster and move on to their usual night of fun and mayhem.

Unfortunately this creature was just the first of many and they have picked up the scent of their fallen comrade and seek out him/her.  The boys have decided to take the body to their friendly drug dealer for storage.  Bad idea.

While the film is done on the cheap, it is also rewarding with some genuine moments of suspense.  The boys and their nurse victim (Jodie Whittaker) form an alliance to combat the invaders.  With the exception of ""Shaun"" vet Nick Frost in a small role, the central gang casting are all first time film actors about 15 or 16 years old.  The film isn't glossy but the now hairy creatures have a very cool blue glow to their teeth.  This is a well made and highly effective film and one of the best of the year.",1320019200,2,1457,4.344444444444444

When scores of vicious, glow-in-the-dark-toothed alien beasts descend upon the Block, a group of teen thugs wind up getting caught in the crossfire and trying to survive.  With numerous odes to John Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13 among others, Attack the Block doesn't offer anything we haven't seen before, but it doesn't try to either.  Instead, its sole focus is to deliver enjoyable, bloody thrills with some great dialogue and acting showcases, and it works for what it is.  Also featuring the always-enjoyable Nick Frost (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, Paul) in a great, albeit brief, role that shines while it lasts.",1319760000,,730,5.058333333333334

4711524,5,B005J4TLN4,"This movie deserves multiple Academy Awards.  I have yet to see any film that has captured the social climate in the most unique possible way.  The remarks regarding police action in Britain, as well as volunteering for Red Cross in some 3rd World area just ""to get a good tan"" were definitely deliberate and proudly blatant. There are 3rd World conditions in Britain as well as the US.  I love the interesting timing of this movie.  The London Riots took place in the Councils.  Just wait until the South Bronx erupts!  This movie sheds light on a very serious topic the masses seem to have overlooked.  Moses, the main character, is played by an ""unknown"" actor.  This cat is more authentic that Curtis ""50 Cent"" Jackson, or any other gangster trying to cross over into acting.  This movie is brilliant.",1319673600,6,805,4.692857142857143
4711525,3,B005J4TLN4,"Lots of hype surrounding this movie, and after watching it last night I can see why. While it does have elements of The Warriors and Escape From New York, Attack the Block is fresh and exciting pitting street kid thugs (and one woman) against an alien invasion of some very nasty, blacker than night, with glowing massive teeth that will rip you to shreds - Aliens. The acting by a bunch of new kid actors was very believable. The aliens are done very well and intertwined in a solid action movie.

On the flip side...

I read the other day, discussions are on the way of how to remake this in America. Yesterday my reaction was of 'huh?', today I understand. Despite the skill, the story and it is a phenomenal alien movie, it suffers horribly, not only from a heavy English accent, but conversations that mostly consist of slang, and English slang at that. I literally missed the first 10 minutes of dialog, because I could not understand anything they were saying.
I then turned on subtitles (groan). But at least I now could read what I was hearing. But even with that, so much of the dialog was very specific to the English slang, and I was guessing at best what they were meaning. This really counters the otherwise excellent picture.

I can totally see them doing it over for the American audience. I just hope they focus on the magic that made this film, with excellent characters, street kid scenario, and attention to detail with tension, photography and light.

I give this only 3 stars, but if the dialog wasn't such a hindrance, the rating would be much higher",1319587200,3,1573,4.567375886524823

I thought the movie and the writing was amazing. There are spots where the dialogue is hard to understand, unless you watch a lot of British movies. The action scenes were surprisingly well-choreographed and filmed. The story was lacking, but accomplished the job that the director sought to do. It honestly is more a character film, much like Guy Ritchie's movies were before he lost touch with his roots. I could see how some might not like this movie, particularly Americans.

The movie simply is not funny.  Here's an example of an attempt at humor:  When trying to decide what to do about the dead alien one guy says ""Yo, we should call Simon Cowell because this alien's got talent.""  The only thing vaguely funny about the movie was the kid's accents.

The special effects were about on par with the movie alien, which was released in 1979.
