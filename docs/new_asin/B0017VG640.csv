3175644,2,B0017VG640,"I was really excited when I saw this was going to released on dvd. because the vhs was just a fuzzy version. but to my dismay all the dvd is the vhs fuzzy dupe on a disc. not a studio or professional job. was very disappointed. I have purchased unreleased dvds and expected that. but not when you pay $22 plus shipping for some fuzzy work.

with that said I wanted this movie becasue it is a funny satire 1970's style. full of familiar faces and boogey music. its like a old sit-com with nudity. and for that I am glad to own it. just wish when they announced the release they meant a new and clear copy. not just the same old thing on that vhs tape.",1137456000,17,650,4.078125

3175653,4,B0017VG640,"Was shocked when I discovered that Dark Sky Films released a legit copy of LINDA LOVELACE FOR PRESIDENT on DVD. This in not a DVD-R, this is actually pressed! How shocking!! This bad little movie was created from Arthur Marks' idea. Arthur Marks' name should be reconizable to film fans from his low budget films from the '70s. Arthur Marks (who directed most of LLFP) directed drive-in classics like Bonnie's Kids (1973), The Roommates (1973), Detroit 9000 (1973), Bucktown and Friday Foster (both 1975). Just glad to see a company release another one of his films on DVD. Dark Sky Films did wonders with LINDA LOVELACE FOR PRESIDENT. The picture is widescreen 1.85 and looks pretty good for being made on such a low budget. The only special feature is a nine minute documentary on the making of the film with Arthur Marks being interviewed (very good doc. but too short). Listening to him talk makes me want to see more of his films. Dark Sky has already released a really good version of Bonnie's Kids (a much better film than any of his others) and have been rumored to be releasing THE ROOMMATES on DVD (its first ever home video release) but that rumor started several years ago and still haven't seen or heard if it will ever be released. After releasing LINDA LOVELACE FOR PRESIDENT, Dark Sky should do Arthur Marks' fans the pleasure of finally releasing THE ROOMMATES.
Have had bootleg copies of LINDA LOVELACE FOR PRESIDENT on videotape, but this DVD really gives this little comedy a new life! Enjoy watching this little movie now that it looks decent and widescreen (enhanced for widescreen TVs).
Also of note: Code Red is scheduled to release Arthur Marks' CLASS OF '74 on DVD in the near future. Should be another winner from this fine director.",1360108800,3,1760,4.736156351791531
3175654,3,B0017VG640,"Everyone knows that Linda Lovelace (born Linda Boreman) became famous for certain abilities in the groundbreaking film ""Deep Throat"" (she later became an anti-pornography activist and denounced her career in pornography saying she had been forced into it by an abusive husband.) Seeking to capitalize on that fame, the producers of ""Linda Lovelace For President"" hatched a plan to use that unexpected notoriety by putting her in a mainstream movie. As an aside, B-movie fans take note that one of the producers is none other than David Winters, who later made ""Space Mutiny,"" a ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" fan favorite.

The film is largely bawdy, and certainly features its share of cavorting and exposed skin. In 1975 it earned an ""X"" rating, though now I imagine it would be an easy ""R."" From a nudity and morals perspective it's several levels above today's trashy reality television. The film opens with Linda Lovelace striking a pose while text reveals that the film is designed to offend everyone. For 1975, I'm sure it succeeded, but one thing I liked about the film was its lack of Political Correctness: this movie could never be made today. It is offensive and occasionally sacrilegious, but it's an equal opportunity offender, and has everything from talking bears and monkeys, to a political faction demanding that parakeets be freed, to the worst Tarzan impression in history, and a resident extremist, Adolph Von Luftwaffer (Garry Goodrow,) who teaches the cast a new and interesting salute that you may have seen somewhere before. Like I said: offensive? Yes. PC? No.

The premise of this film struck me as strangely relevant to modern politics, perhaps even more so than when the film was made. The plot boils down to voter apathy in the country spoiling the electoral process: nobody likes anyone on either of the major party tickets, so they look for a new direction. Through a freak show of a convention the pick Linda Lovelace for their nominee for President, who is backed by her Uncle Sam (Robert Symonds.) Really. This is a plot that still rings true today, and it's really the best thing about the movie. The party name should have been ""The Double Entendre Party"" with a near-continuous barrage of one-liners like ""A vote for Linda is a blow for democracy."" You get the idea. Of course the two major parties try to stop Linda, even employing an assassin named ""The Assassinator"" (ostensibly credited as Alfredo Fetchuttini, not to be confused with Fetchuttini Alfredo, who played Mayor Wasp.) The Assassinator has a quite daring moustache, but is equal parts Cyrano de Bergerac and Jacques Clouseau. Needless to say, he is ineffective at his given vocation.

Unsurprisingly, Linda wins the election and gives what is certainly the most interesting acceptance speech in history! The film has humor all over the map, ranging from fairly cerebral to extremely campy and base jokes that would embarrass a teenage boy. The cast is absolutely gigantic, and features truly deranged performances that vary in quality, but are mostly decent. Linda Lovelace is not a gifted actress, but that's not why she's here, of course. Mickey Dolenz (!) is Lt. Fenwick, an easily-excited driver of Linda's tour bus. His performance is great, and is exactly what ""Monkees"" fans would expect excepting the driving lesson he receives about vehicles with two steering wheels. Other notables in the cast are Fuddle Bagley as Abdul Ali Umagooma, Morgan Upton as The ""Veep"" (who is easily the creepiest character in the movie,) the great Joey Forman as Chow Ming, and the much younger Scatman Crothers as Super Black. Dolenz, Forman, and Crothers are the comedic highlights of the film by far. I especially enjoyed Forman's acupuncture therapy and predisposition to ironing, while Crothers' pool game is truly entertaining.

""Linda Lovelace For President"" is a very dated movie that exposes the mentality and apathy of the mid-1970's better than many other films that were much more expensive. Many of the cast members are very talented (and many are not,) the script is very inconsistent and the gags (if you'll pardon the pun) vary from juvenile to sophisticated making it difficult to pigeonhole in any specific comedy genre. It's a political satire that is still relevant today, and despite the generally tame (by today's standards) but occasionally offensive material, the theme of political ambivalence is what earns it three stars.",1294444800,3,4439,5.060109289617486

LOL if you watch the movie I'll see what I mean the whole movie is a mockery of everything that goes on in the 70s .
