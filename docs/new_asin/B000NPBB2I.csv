Great b horror done right Joe is the man",1475107200,,81,3.5555555555555554
8180415,5,B000NPBB2I,"If you enjoyed the first Terror Toons, I would definitely recommend its sequel. Its got a bigger budget and its just as fun to watch. The special effects are very gory again as well. The Devils son character was probably my favorite in this one.  You don't really need to see the first one to understand the story line either. The dvd has a bunch of extras too. The Terror Toons 1.5 on the dvd is good fun as well. I would recommend to Terror Toon fans if you liked the first round. The dvd is not easy to find these days either. Also want to say R.I.P. Shane Ballard, thanks for the laughs!",1473292800,,591,4.184210526315789
8180416,4,B000NPBB2I,"I plan to watch this movie since I have the first one.  But I haven't seen part 3 on here yet hopefully they put it on here for some who enjoys b rated movies.  I might write another review as an update of how I thought of part 2 of this ridiculous b rated film. : updated review... so I thought it was really good and ridiculously funny, yes the acting is bad but adds a certain charm to this movie.  So there is no reason to take this movie so seriously what did you expect from this movie anyway?

  This movie was bad on purpose...so ease up they should have done this that criticism.  But it little bit more disturbing the first one not many deaths really they executed the death scenes in right place in the right moment.  Excellently made bad b rated movie in my book!  It's definitely worth checking out fort s**** and giggles.  This gets 4 star only from me, just don't expect it to be blockbuster worthy is all I can say about take care now.",1446163200,,951,4.175824175824176

8180418,1,B000NPBB2I,"If you were a fan of the first Terror Toons, you will be disappointed. While the makeup was decent (the cornerstone of the TT films), the rest of the movie was just unwatchable. Frankly, and I wish I had more to offer as far as insight, but it was just... boring. In the end, just a waste of time and a little money. Hardcore TT fans will undoubtedly like this, though I'd suggest watching it with the volume off and your Insane Clown Posse tunes cranked up, right around 4:20pm - then, and only then, will this film even touch on the cult following feel of the first one.",1416528000,,572,4.256880733944954
8180419,3,B000NPBB2I,"Before I start my review, I noticed a continuity error. In this movie, the DVD is mailed at the beginning. The DVD features Hansel and Gretel...but they weren't ""created"" until after the DVD was sent! Oh, well. Like I said in title, definitely not as good as the first one. And the three hot guys that are mentioned....try 2 hot guys, lol. And seeing people eat is gross. The dark-haired guy from the first one is back as human Hansel, nipple piercings and all. The costumes look even cheaper than they did in the first movie. Even the cartoon effects in the first one were better (they were more cartoon-like), and DON'T get me started on that 'Terror Toons 1.5' mini at the beginning of the movie! There are a number of bonus features, but the main movie itself is people trapped in a house trying to kill the bad guys, like the 1st one. I would recommend buying this is you bought the 1st one and want both, but it's not worth buying on it's own. Sorry, Joe Castro.",1327276800,2,968,4.383333333333334

Starring Brinke Stevens,Jeff Dylan Graham,Jed Rowen ,Ken Hall and Eric Spudic.
Written  and directed By JOE CASTRO

This film is really good.
You know ,Its so rare to see ORIGINAL, Terror  Toons 2 is that that simply put.
I see tributes to Twilight Zone and Joe Dante and Peter Jackson.(c). What some won't get is the Danny Elfman, Oingo Boingo pastiche...Its reeking of Reel Love.
  How in the world ,Joe Castro came up with this beats me...So far I think he hates Birthdays,Clowns and Hansel and Gretel...WTF ?
 The animation,sets,and GORE were right on and worthy of awards.
I did hate that you cant get attached to any characters that are good,Because they are leaving with some un-wanted mayhem bestowed on `em.
Tons of extras,great poster art for cover,This film is starting to get a well deserved cult following on Myspace.",1181606400,,863,4.910344827586207
8180421,5,B000NPBB2I,"I easily fell in love with the first Terror Toons, and was a little hesitant for the sequel.  However, Terror Toons 2 exceeded all my expectations in all aspects.  The story line and dialogued really pulled me in, and the visual aspect (special effects, make up, lighting, etc.) was very appealing.  If you enjoy colorful and refreashing films, definately check this out!  It's definately not your everyday so-so film!",1180483200,,418,5.0144927536231885
8180422,5,B000NPBB2I,"If you liked the 1st release ""Terror Toons"" then you'll love Terror Toons 2. This INSTANT CULT CLASS-SICK is yet another one of Joe Castro's sensational masterpieces. More horror, more GORE, more of what you want & expect from Joe Castro & Steven Escobar!! It's a simple birthday party that turns into a shrieking gore fest. Monsters come out from a regular television set wreaking havoc on an innocent birthday party. Terror Toons 2 is filled with gags, gore & Joe Castro's inventive death scenes. Terror Toons 2 delivers creative writing, gr8 score, editing & is very well executed for it's genra. This must see horror/gore flick is 4 the fan with a sense of imagination, gore hounds will love it too!!.
I WRECK-A-MEND you watch Terror Toons 1 before watching Terror Toons 2 so you 1st timers will know what's going on (you can buy it here on Amazon, Blockbuster or anywhere fine movies are sold). Also be on the lookout 4 Terror Toons 1.5 (Coming Soon) anybody ready for a 2nd helping of gore?
