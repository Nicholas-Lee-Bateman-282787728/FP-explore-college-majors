7304801,5,B0102AL8V2,"I feel like I've been waiting for this release forever, but it's finally on the way.  On top of that we're getting a Collector's Edition too.  For those of you who haven't seen this anime bedore it takes place in modern day Tokyo where people live in constant fear of monsters called Ghouls.  What makes things worse is that they look exactly like human, but with an appetite for human flesh.  That being said the main character Ken Keneki isn't concerned with any of this.  That is until he has an violent encounter with a Ghoul and becomes the first Human/ Ghoul half breed, and is forced to adapt to his new life.

I love anime series when the protagonist must find him or herself and is forced to overcome tremendous odds.  Not only does Tokyo Ghoul have a great story but it's loaded with gore, action and a little humor.  And as a added bonus both the English dub and Subs are excellent and in fact the dub is almost as good as the sub, which is a rare thing to see.

If you're still on the fence I'll leave you with this.  Tokyo Ghoul is for you if you liked animes like Parasyte, Blue Exorcist, Attack On Titan and similar action animes with a lot of blood and gore.  I've listed the product information and features below for those who are interested in that information.

7304804,5,B0102AL8V2,"Otaku John, the anime / manga / light novel fan chiming in to rate and review Tokyo Ghoul, a great anime series.  This is a terrific, original, and beautifully artistic anime series that explores humanity, and the lack of it, between people and ""Ghouls"", who feed off humans to different extents.  That being said, the series is violent, and bit gory, but its done tastefully, and not done for sensationalism.  (Mature - Adult Audiences recommended).  You can't help but feel sympathy for the main character Kaneki, and his new-found Ghoul friends that he clings to after being inadvertently turned into a ""Ghoul"", after an experimental surgery that changes his life forever.  (don't want to reveal too much... I don't like spoilers).  Needless to say, you'll enjoy exploring Kaneki's new world as a Ghoul, and his strive to hold onto his humanity despite of it.  The animation is breathtakingly beautiful, and the colors are amazing.  Definitely worth the purchase.  If you like to read, I HIGHLY recommend the manga too. (check out my review of the manga on Amazon.)  A great read.  If you like dark fantasy like this, also check out Hellsing anime / manga, Devil May Cry, Vampire Knight, Trinity Blood, Dance In The Vampire Bund, and Elfen Lied.",1503705600,,1248,4.895238095238096

7304811,5,B0102AL8V2,Tokyo ghoul is an amazing manga. It makes for an even better anime as the visuals are incredibly appealing. The color palette used is gorgeous. There are lots of neon colors used an each season feels like its being shown through a stained glass window.  I love it.  The fight scenes are beautifully animated an a joy to watch. Each new Kagune introduced kept me on the edge of my seat waiting to see more.  Ive watched every episode twice an will continue to do so as I introduced friends an family to possibly my favorite anime of all time.,1493510400,3,541,4.39
7304812,2,B0102AL8V2,As far as the product it's self everything was in good shape in is English ed dubbed. All disc do work. I bought this looking for new anime to watch an this one had a big fan base. So why not right. Well I have finished this season and I am going to be honest it okay nothing amazing. Animation is good. I also think it lacks in story. Don't get alot of back story on things at least in this season. An i have alot of questions until answered. The art work is good lots of action and gore. But if you looking for a deep and we'll written story it's just not here. But if you are just looking for gore an action it's right up your alley.,1489276800,2,636,3.9
7304813,5,B0102AL8V2,"I bought this set for my nephew after the two of us started watching it from my copies back in summer of 2016. He has watched it multiple times, says the discs work well, and he enjoys the plot. He was annoyed at where the series ended, so I got him the second season, too, which of course made him all the more annoyed because that one ends on a cliffhanger, too. The manga and the anime seem to be neck and neck right now, so both of us will have to wait until more material is available.

From both our perspectives, I can say my copy (which I only listen to in the original Japanese, rather than the English dubs) is awesome, and my nephew likes the voice actors for the English dub fine, so no complaints on that end. All-in-all, for anyone who is either a fan of the manga, or just wants copies of the series without having to go onto Crunchyroll or some other site, this is a good buy. We enjoy it and will continue to collect whatever DVDs of the series are made available.",1487289600,6,981,4.163157894736842
7304814,3,B0102AL8V2,"Worked Great on first run through, however it freezes up ever since.",1486339200,,68,4.75
7304815,5,B0102AL8V2,"Thoughts:
I highly recommend this anime.  I started off reading the manga before watching the anime.  The anime does a good job covering most of what the manga had to offer.  It has enough action to keep you engaged.  The scenes are uncensored so you won't get that black bar covering excessive gore / violence.  As with all anime, I try to watch at least one episode in English dub--It's tolerable in Tokyo Ghoul...but I switched back after the one episode.

Features:
It contains all of season 1 (12 episodes on 2 DVDs / Blu-rays) with the box cover slip.  The box is slightly thicker than a standard Blu-ray case",1486252800,,615,4.536363636363636

If you like things like vampires this could be interesting for you too, even though there aren't any vampires a ghoul is similar in certain ways. Deffinatly give this anime a look at!

7304831,5,B0102AL8V2,"I LOVE Tokyo Ghoul. It is at the top of my list of anime series that takes the cake. This IS a gory series. If you can't take gore then don't watch it. It is a tear jerker at several points as well but that's all I'll say on that. It's not so much a horror series really but there is a bit of psychological play in the mix. BE WARNED: IF YOU DON'T CRACK YOUR FINGERS NOW DO NOT WATCH THIS SERIES. YOU WILL DEVELOP A BAD HABIT OF IT UNLESS YOU STOP YOURSELF FROM DOING IT. It just happens. It's a key component in the series that really hitches in your mind when you see this. I've always had an issue with cracking knuckles anyways, but after watching this series, it's worse now because of it, but honestly I don't see it as a reason for me to not watch it. The story follows Ken Kaneki, the main character as he goes through some major changes in his life. He's pretty relatable for those of us who are introverts, especially in the beginning. As the story goes on though he has to change for one reason or another and that's what's keeping the series going. It is great action, there's twists and turns you don't see coming. There's a lot of depth to the story as it continues and even at the end of season 2 there's still more to be learned about the characters. A TON actually.

What you get with this product is the complete FIRST SEASON ONLY. This is Season one of Tokyo Ghoul, but it is the DVD/Blu-Ray combo pack. so you get two DVD disks and two Blu-ray disks in the case with a sleeve that covers it. It also came blister pack sealed as well. This is a series by Funimation and they did a great job on it. There is English and Japanese language (I highly recommend BOTH as they are done VERY well), you also get English subtitles for the Japanese.

This is one of my favorite series for a reason and it is well worth putting the money into to have for a long time. Now I can watch it all I want and I don't have to wait for internet connection if I don't want to. ENJOY!",1469750400,8,1981,4.089974293059126

7304833,5,B0102AL8V2,Covers roughly the first 7 volumes of the manga and is a fairly good adaptation. The series is beautifully made and due to there only being 12 episodes is an emotional high through every single ep.,1466899200,2,197,4.5

7304839,5,B0102AL8V2,"Im not as keen on surprises as normal people, so feel free to ask about my preference/interest in something not listed or something like a stylish hat.

I got my Tokyo Ghoul Collectors edition box in the mail today, and had the biggest adrenaline rush Ive gotten from unboxing anime/manga in awhile.

And I like unboxing anime & manga.

As you probably know, the show itself is gold. Good for people who haven't seen any anime, and for those whove seen too much. Itll make you laugh, make you think, and make you feel.

The box art of Rize and Kaneki is great both with and without sliding plastic cover that lets you decide how intense you want the outside to look, by either leaving active kakugan on them, along with blood on Rize and the mask on Kaneki, or their calmer expressions without those features.

The slip cover for the DVD/Blu-Rays has a dramatic pose of Kaneki taking his mask off with broken handcuffs on, hair white, and Kagune flourishing. The Disc case itself has grittily gorgeous colorized drawings by the creator, Sui Ishida, of Kaneki with white and black hair, Touka, and Tsukiyama. The 4 discs themselves transition from the white flowers to the red ones that you might remember from Kanekis mental conversation with Rize in one of the later episodes.

Then there are 4 postcard sized cardboard cards with drawings of Kaneki, Rize, Uta, and Ayato (Toukas brother) in the animes art style. The folded cloth poster (or bandana) unravels to be pretty big, about 1.5 x 3 ft, and looks great. Theres also a small notebook, completely blank, with roughly 30 pages that looks like a book in the show (I cant place where exactly I saw it).

Finally, the item I saved for last, had the highest expectations for, and therefore was a little dissapointed by: the artbook. Its a well-bound 3x4 in. size with a nice cover image of Kanekis mask, with a nice blend of colors against the brownish background. I was hoping for a ton of Sui Ishida art, but theres only 16 pieces of his art crammed into 4 small pages. Then theres 12 pages of art of the anime characters. The rest is interviews with the director about the episodes, and a few pages of character info. Not the 44 pages of art I was hoping for.

Still, Im happy with it overall. Ive never considered myself a high dollar payer for collector-y type stuff, it always seemed overpriced, but I really feel like I got my moneys worth on this.",1461283200,,2408,4.55787037037037

7304841,5,B0102AL8V2,"not only is this a WONDERFUL series (especially for horror/thriller/suspense/gore lovers), but the processing and shipping was fast and efficient. packaging was exactly as shown, discs weren't scratched or damaged in any way, and the quality of the English dub is great (though my personal preference leans toward the original Japanese). 10/10 would recommend and would definitely order again.",1460505600,2,393,5.677966101694915

7304849,4,B0102AL8V2,"This anime ,despite the numerous plotholes it has is an okay adaption of the manga. I have the Limited Edition and i personally love it.  I really do wish when this box set was made, that they went back and made a certain episode in that only is in the manga. It was where Banjou, his group and Kaneki, try to escape from Aogiri. But failed and Yamori killed two of Banjou's group..

I'm glad i get to watch all the uncensored episodes.. I only have seen the Jason figt uncensored before this box set..
But i do need to tell everybody who thinks about getting this... Read the manga as well, when it comes to the first season,  the manga will help fill alot of plotholes the first season of the anime left. Please due note in the manga, the Mado arc happens before The Gourmet arc... But all of Season 1's plotholes can be covered by reading the manga. Root A however is doomed.. Don't watch Root A till you have read every manga chapter whether its online or you import the japanese version... It is very hard and annoying to explain the manga to peoplw who have only watched Root A. And not to be rude but you aren't considered to be a true tokyo ghoul fan by the Tokyo Ghoul community till you read the manga.. This is coming from someone who watched the anime first.. I'm not joking, mention about Hide dying in Root A to a Manga fan. They'll be dissapointed that you only watcht the anime.... I fell in love with the manga especially after i read this chapter. (The one in the pic.)

I give the anime, a 9 because its one con is how there was no attempt to at least try to explain certain things. The voice acting is alot better in Season 1 than in Root A...

The worst part for me to watch (and I'm not squeamish) is when a character is tortured at the end of season one. I don't think it is the graphic content that is so difficult to handle, but the psychological damage and sheer insanity of another person that it kind of horrifying for younger audiences.

Anyway, it is pretty different from the manga, but stands on its own pretty well. Worth a try if you like this genre of anime.",1455062400,,588,4.4953271028037385

7304878,5,B0102AL8V2,"This show is not for everyone but i will say that it teaches many moral lessons. it has great character development, the story is a little slow but picks up. one important moral lesson is that it asks the ? is it right to ridicule an entire race for the actions of the few or a group because not all of them are bad and are all being hunted down treated like monsters by society and the government i mean they eat flesh but some find ways of not killing to eat it so it's not right to just hunt them down like some monster. Also it's sort of realistic in the sense that if ghouls were real then this is probably how a real government would handle it with a damn witch hunt. the action is top notch, relationships between characters, the development are all great and as i said great story. It really ?'s the point of view aspect of good and evil, and why things are the way they are. Though for this anime i wouldn't buy it right away i mean i loved it but only after steaming it online did i really fall in love with the series enough to buy it.",1452038400,,1046,4.057971014492754

Very happy and an interesting show. I enjoyed the animation and the attention given to the design of the different characters. Looking forward to season two.,1451347200,,330,4.092307692307692
7304881,4,B0102AL8V2,Didn't know what to expect when I got this. I ended up enjoying it. Can't wait for season 2.,1449705600,2,92,3.8947368421052633
7304882,5,B0102AL8V2,Great series. Kind of slow in the first half but picks up at the end. Season two is even better.,1449705600,2,96,3.85
7304883,2,B0102AL8V2,"""OMG Tokyo Ghoul is the best anime EVAR!!1! You have to buy Tokyo Ghoul!""
Well after hearing this enough times, I finally gave in and bought it.
Having now watched it, I can only conclude that the people who were telling me this are either
1. Very new to anime.
2. Devout Naruto Bleach Z fans.
3. Giving season 1 a rating that later seasons earned.
or
4. Huge fans of Shinji from Neon Genesis Evangelion or god forbid, Cko from Project Ako *cringe*.

Season one is basically Shinji from NGE becoming a half undead and then whining and crying about it for the rest of the season.
I'm now being told that season 2 gets good, that may be true but season one is mainly about whining and crying (did the main character in Fushigi Ygi whine and cry this much?). I expect that this will be generic shonen fighting anime for the rest of its run. So if you love Naruto Bleach Z, this is probably a great anime for you.
If you have been told that this is the greatest series ever, try watching a few episodes at a friend's house or anime convention before throwing down money.

And in answer to your question ""Yes, I do know that giving anime a negative review leads to down votes."".",1448409600,5,1173,4.3031674208144794

Then there's the dub, which was executed perfectly. We also have all the cool stuff that came with it: cloth poster, art book, sketch book, and a beautiful box to keep it all in.

7304904,5,B0102AL8V2,"Ok i watched this entire series so far, its an amazing  show, blood, cursing, action, ect. Now i know iv heard people  say to read  the manga first, but i did that after watch tokyo ghoul  and tokyo ghoul root A.  The anime is unique  compaired to the manga, not only  are 2 small arcs flippped (as compaired to the manga) but the anime really  starts to shift to an ""alternate universe"" as compaired to the  manga universe of the show, the creator stated in an interview that tokyo ghoul  root  A (season  2 of tokyo ghoul) was the creators orignal  idea to end the show,  still  a cliff hanger for a possible  season  3 (which could  be a parrallel to tokyo ghoul  re)",1441238400,8,670,4.258064516129032

8721310,5,B0102AL8V2,"Kaneki Ken was a shy, ordinary college student until the girl of his dreams went on a date with him and almost ate him. For ghouls walk among the citizens of Tokyo and Kaneki nearly became Rize Kamashiros prey.

Has Kaneki truly escaped from Rize? A disastrous accident killed her, but her organs were planted into Kaneki. He lives on, discovering he has Rizes appetite for flesh, and humanity is starting to look entirely too appetizing, including his only friend, Hideyoshi Nagachika. To make matters worse, he still smells entirely too appetizing himself to certain ghouls, notably the flamboyant, yet devious gourmet, Tsukiyama Shu. Plus there are humans only too aware that there are ghouls among them, who are more than willing to hunt the predators down, using sinister tools that shock and horrify their prey.

Trapped in a world of hunger and madness, Kaneki struggles to find a balance between the ghoul and human within, seeking ghouls whom like himself, seek to coexist peacefully with the outer world. The outer world, however, is not willing to let him and his allies alone, threatening to swallow everyone in the conflict between human and ghoul, as well as ghoul and ghoul.

I saw this before I read any of the manga (its the reason I bought the manga). Kanekis hunger, the way its embodied by Rize as almost a separate personality is emphasized in this. Touka, Kanekis surly bishoujo ally is almost like a dark angel or superhero in how shes depicted, her timing, and her cool attitude. Tsukiyamas flamboyant eccentricity and dark obsession with Kaneki stole the show for me. The combat sequences were beautiful and dramatic, perfectly high lighting the emotions of the character caught in the middle of them, without overshadowing those emotions.

Parts of the manga were cut, but only one distorted the plot a bit. Other segments were enhanced in the animation, using animation to the fullest to enhance the story.

For a dramatic story with its own urban mythology brought to life by a beautiful soundtrack, aesthetically pleasing artwork, and compelling characters, I give this five stars.",1525132800,,2110,4.982954545454546
8721311,1,B0102AL8V2,"I ordered the blu-ray copy of season one because I absolutely adore the series so I was more than willing to spend the 40 dollar price for it. However, I just received my package and it came with none of the discs, just a case for that I cant leave a good review on this item.",1523491200,,276,3.9464285714285716
8721312,3,B0102AL8V2,"First star taken off because of the shriveled case similar to another reviewer... However, the cover art is actually fine - only the thin plastic holding the paper is wrinkly from the way the case was shrink wrapped. So if you have a spare blu-ray case, you could potentially swap out the cover art and the discs inside. I took off a second star because my slipcover also came bent, and with something disgusting stuck to it...

You can watch Tokyo Ghoul for free on Funimation's website, and it's on Hulu too for now. The content on these discs is exactly how I remember when I streamed it. You don't get much by buying this except to watch it without internet, and to have a physical copy to collect. Not many extras: disc 1 only has commentary for episode 4, and the physical box has no pamphlet inside.

The discs themselves have no blemishes and all the episodes play without issue. You can watch either subbed or dubbed. You get 2 dvd discs and 2 blu-ray discs in one case. To be clear you are just buying season 1 of Tokyo Ghoul, and there are 2 seasons out so far, with a third to air next month.

As someone who hasn't read the manga, I love this anime. It's a serious story about survival and the right to exist. The main emotion is despair. Some romance but it's not a focus of the plot. Some nudity where you don't really see anything. Nothing sexual except one brief scene. A lot of gore and fighting. Characters have a wide range of ages but nearly all of them are adults.

tl;dr
This anime is perfect to me, as someone who never read the manga. But since it's free to stream legally, the messed up case and slipcover sort of ruined the point of the purchase for me. I bought this new from Amazon directly, and not a third party seller on this site.",1521590400,4,1763,4.317220543806647

When I removed the sleeve I noticed that the plastic on the blu-ray case was very wrinkled, almost like it had been exposed to a lot of moisture/heat. The item is shrink-wrapped, however, it is quite apparent that the wrinkles are in the plastic on the actual blu-ray case without removing the shrink-wrapping. I'm going to assume that someone went a little crazy with the heat during the shrink-wrapping process because the back of the case is undamaged. I'm pretty disappointed with this purchase, especially since I bought it as a gift.",1518652800,,613,4.903846153846154
