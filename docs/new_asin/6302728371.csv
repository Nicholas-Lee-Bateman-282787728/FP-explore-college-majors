502423,5,6302728371,"This movie was excellent---very entertaining.  The music was wonderful...character development was very good (I think everyone can identify with one or more of the characters).  Definitely a ""family  movie""....no violence, no sex, no drugs, no cursing......only singing,  laughter, and a few trials to be overcome.  Doris Day was excellent (as  usual), and her younger brother cracked me up!!  I also enjoyed the  father's role and the suitor ""wanna-be"", who just wouldn't give  up.  Highly recommend this movie---it will leave you feeling happy and  humming a merry tune!",919468800,5,572,5.459770114942529

Only the young jaded crowd with think this film is corny, hokey, or whatever slang word they use now for clean entertainment.  One reason I bought it was because I grew up during WWII and my mother was still singing the WWI song, Till We Meet Again.

502624,5,6302728371,"I am a big fan of Doris Day, but I can't help but remember MGM's stellar classic ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" starring Judy Garland. Similarities are stunning; the parents of Marjorie Winfield (Doris Day) in this movie look and act similar to parents in ""Meet Me in St Louis."" The story is very similar and some critics suggested that this is Warner Brothers version of MGM's Christmas classic. But anyone who likes Doris Day and the musicals would love this movie. In fact this movie was such a hit that the studio filmed another direct sequel ""By the Light of the Silvery Moon (1953)"" with all the actors playing the same characters.

The story is about the Winfield family who move into a small town in Indiana. Marjorie Winfield, the daughter of the family begins to romance William Sherman (Gordon MacRae) who lives across the street. Tomboy Marjorie slowly transforms herself into a beautiful young lady. Although Doris Day and Gordon MacRae are little old for the roles they play but their romance picks up and both display their vocal abilities in a number of songs. Jack C. Smith plays the role of Doris' persistent suitor who won't take no for an answer. Ellen Corby is a wonderful schoolteacher who tries to straighten the misbehaving Billy Gray, the brother of Doris Day and Mary Wickes as a maid who is constantly dropping the silverware. This is an outstanding movie despite the fact it has strong resemblance to ""Meet Me in St. Louis."" I highly recommend this musical to all the fans of Doris Day.",1417564800,,1506,4.683018867924528

502719,5,6302728371,"I'm confounded as to why this is considered a musical.  Most of the songs are done in part, some abruptly cut off due to dialog or intrusion by other characters.  They rarely sing a song completely through, uninterrupted.  I found that incredibly annoying.  As for the claim that this is the poor man's version of Meet Me In St. Louis, it is, but so what.  It still has some admirably qualities.  The story is at times hilarious, who would complain because they moved into a bigger better house!?  Yet, that's how this movie starts.  No one but the father (Leon Ames) is delighted with their new location, new surroundings.  The story is packed with fun and populated with great characters.  The ever reliable Rosemary DeCamp plays the mother in this piece; she pretty much goes with the flow.  The incomparable Mary Wickes plays Stella, their poor put upon maid/cook/referee.  ""I wonder what you'd get for manslaughter in this state?""  Ellen Corby shows up as a no nonsense teacher (Miss Mary Stevens), easily duped by a great sob story.  Gordon MacRae plays the nitwit across the street (boy next door).  He's a pompous twit given to spouting complete nonsense.  ""It's a fake, just like everything else in this world!""  Doris Day plays Marjorie Winfield, the resident tomboy when it suits her; otherwise, she's more than willing to be pretty as a picture (when stuffed with powder puffs).  The star of this piece though, scene stealer par excellence, is Billy Gray as the recalcitrant little brother Wesley Winfield.  ""I wouldn't be an angel if you killed me!""  It's too bad they went for romance rather than the Tom Sawyer angle.  Oh well, a missed opportunity.

A very nostalgic period piece filled with warmth and humor, a real treat to watch (it goes in my collection).",1370131200,,1775,4.788778877887789

I think I remember liking it when I was 8 years-old...but let's face it: what do 8 year-olds know?

Girl and Neighbor Boy are happy.  Neighbor Boy offends Father.  Father throws Neighbor Boy out of house.  Girl cries.  Little Brother burns house down.  Father stares at burnt down house, thinks about how he was once young, and forgives Neighbor Boy.  Girl and Neighbor Boy are happy.  The End.

There is the story of ""On Moonlight Bay"".

Okay, okay, so there's more to it than that.  But almost hardly anything more exciting or redeeming.  First off, just to exemplify the dokiness of this movie, say (out loud) ""On Moonlight Bay with Doris Day and Gordon McRae.""  Seriously.  Did they cast this film just so it all rhymed?

George Winfield `Father' (Leon Ames) has committed the worst possible sin towards his family.  He has moved them two blocks away from their home to a bigger house.  Even though the new home is closer to his bank, he insists that he moved them with his daughter, Marjorie `Marjie' (Doris Day) in mind--he wants to find her respectable suitors and turn her from a wild tomboy into a proper young lady. Ironically, the miracle occurs the very day that they move into their new home: Marjie stops her little brother, Wesley (Billy Gray), from shooting a gun in the neighbors' barn, but in the process, she herself shoots through the barn door, and the door promptly crashes down upon the handsome neighbor boy, William Sherman `Bill' (Gordon McRae).  It only takes one lock of the eyes for him to forgive her as well as fall in love with her.

The rest of the story is a mess-pot of love letters, lies, tears, and...dishes crashing to the floor (to the dismay of opinionated, caring maid, Stella (Mary Wickes).  Marjie and Bill begin a somewhat odd courtship, and not one that Marjie's father altogether approves of.  In fact, Father begins to regret ever moving to the new house because of his daughter's affiliation with boys.  Then again, if she'd only show more interest in the boys he picks out--the boring, dull, arrogant ones, that is.  Despite her love for Bill and her history with tomboy-ish-nes, Marjie proves to be a rather weak lover.  It seems like when she needs to stand up to her father's bullying, she merely allows herself to be tugged along, tears streaming down her cheeks.

Little brother, Wesley, is an entirely different matter.  This boy is the devil in human child form.  Sure, he's got a cute face and can sometimes make you smile, but in real life, this kid is what we call S-P-O-I-L-E-D.  The biggest content issue also has to do with him.  Make sure that any kid who watches this film knows that they could not get away with telling lies and breaking windows like Wesley did--that boy deserved a sound, square spanking.  Instead, he actually got away with each bad thing he did without a word of reproof.

As far as other content issue, there is almost nothing.  On their first night out, Alice Winfield `Mother' (Rosemary DeCamp) encourages Marjie to put two powder puffs in her bosom.  While dancing, they fall out and are handed to Marjie by complete strangers (both men, I think).  Bill tells Marjie that he doesn't believe in marriage, and she is convinced that he is right--they both agree that two people who are really in love should not be bound by conventional thinking (and yes, they end up getting married in the end).

This certainly isn't Gordon McRae's best, and probably the worst role I've seen Doris Day play.  There are actually very few songs, and I can't even remember anything about the few that were in the film.  I'm not sure if the plot revolves around Wesley and his horrible deeds or the rocky courtship between Marjie and Bill.  I guess the best thing I can say about this film is that it's not too deep (and it is lighthearted).  But overall, I would summarize it in this word: ""strange"".  It's almost like an attempt to create a ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" spoof.  If you merely have the goal to watch every old musical in the universe, add this one to the bottom half of your list.  Or you could waste a few hours of your life and create your own opinion about ""On Moonlight Bay"" (with Doris Day and Gordon McRae).",1241395200,,4270,4.627163781624501

It hearkens back to a time when no person was considered perfect, and no one personality type as the preferred. The old movies celebrated humanity, foibles and nobility alike. Every person had value, and every person had flaws. The flavor of life was in the interplay of lifestyle patterns, with personalities, situations and stages of the characters' lives.

502948,5,6302728371,"If you liked Meet Me In Saint Louis and would like more of the same technicolor musical-comedy nostalgia mix, On Moonlight Bay is more of the same (as well as it's sequel, By The Light of the Silvery Moon).  In fact, Doris Day's father in these films is played by Leon Ames, the quintessential turn-of-the-century middle-class American father, who also played Judy Garland's father in Meet Me In Saint Louis.
Day plays a teen-age girl, Marjorie Winfield, who's just at the age where she still wants to play baseball, but her father wants her to meet refined young men, who include Gordon MacRae (Oklahoma).
Doris Day displays her talents fully in this feature, both singing and acting, and acting while singing while eating an apple.  But in my opinion the show is stolen by her daydreaming little brother Wesley Winfield, a character based on Penrod Schofield from the novels of Booth Tarkington, played very naturally by Billy Gray (later to portray Bud Anderson on Father Knows Best).  Wesley get's into a series of misadventures comparable to Tom Sawyer, Dennis the Menace, even Bart Simpson.  For instance, caught daydreaming about flying out of his chair at school, he talks his way out of punishment by telling his teacher, Ellen Corby (later to portray Grandma Walton), the plot of a film he'd seen as though it were real, accusing his father of drunkeness and abuse in the process.  That's straigh out of Penrod, Chapters 7-10.  Wesley get's a big pocket knife and sling shot for his birthday, and gets a chance to play with his neighbor's loaded gun; that's one thing you won't see in modern movies, let alone Doris Day's lovely singing.
Filling out the cast are Rosemary DeCamp (The Story Of Seabiscuit, The Treasure of Lost Canyon, 13 Ghosts) as Mrs. Winfield, and Mary Wickes (Father Dowling Mysteries) as the cook.  Both Ellen Corby and Mary Wickes had some of the most distinguished careers as character actresses in movies and TV, both working regularly from the 1930s through the 1990s.
On Moonlight Bay's funny, romantic, entertaining and uplifting throughout; if you don't care for the nostalgia,it's still recommended for the music; and if you don't care for the circa 1917 songs, it's still recommended for the comedy.",1118534400,4,2239,4.923076923076923
502949,5,6302728371,"ON MOONLIGHT BAY is a charming period musical, perhaps Warner Brothers' answer to MGM's hugely-successful MEET ME IN ST LOUIS.  It is based on Booth Tarkington's `Penrod' stories.

Marjorie Winfield (Doris Day) has just moved with her family to another part of town.  She is a baseball-playing tomboy, but when she happens to run into handsome neighbour William Sherman (Gordon MacRae), her feminine instincts kick in and she trades her baseball and trousers for chiffon and perfume.

The rest of Marjorie's family includes her parents (Leon Ames and Rosemary DeCamp), precocious little brother Wesley (Billy Gray) and deadpan housekeeper Stella (Mary Wickes).  It is a sunny, funny portrayal of a more innocent era, and thus charming viewing.

The entire movie is a complete joy.  Doris Day and Gordon MacRae are perfect for the leads (they were also beautifully paired in Warners' TEA FOR TWO), and the film was such a success that a sequel was made reuniting all the main cast members - BY THE LIGHT OF THE SILVERY MOON.",1112227200,8,1023,4.982352941176471
502950,5,6302728371,"Traditional American values and warm nostalgia blend seamlessly in this WB film based on Booth Tarkington's Penrod stories. Starring a young Doris Day and Gordon MacRae and set in Indiana during WWI it is more a sweet story of love and family values scattered with songs than a traditional Hollywood musical. The sets of Indiana during the early 20th century are marvelous and a cast that includes Leon Ames, Jack Smith, Ellen Corby and Rosemary De Camp give Doris Day and Gordon MacRae all the fun and drama they need to fall in love.

Doris Day is the baseball playing tomboy, Margie, who meets William (MacRae) in the unlikliest manner when she takes a gun away from her mischievous little brother, Wesley, and almost shoots him in the process! Love blooms, of course, and soon she trades her cleats for high heels as she and William overcome her father's objections and the enlistment of William and his entire graduating class of Indiana U into the army.

Along the way we get snowball fights and the sweet angst of young and innocent love, not to mention some really nice songs. A few belly laughs are provided as Margie's little brother, Wesley, makes up a horrible story about his family based on a flicker he has seen to sidestep some homework that has the whole town talking!

Perhaps because this film so often gets compared to the perfect musical of American nostalgia, ""Meet Me in St. Louis,"" it doesn't get the recognition it deserves. Doris Day shows that glowing magic that endeared her to audiences around the world and the film itself is a warm and wonderful reminder of America and its values. The end of this film will leave a warm feeling in your heart just as it did the public in 1949 and is a reminder of a more innocent time. A good film for the entire family.",1112054400,6,1785,4.6069182389937104

The father decided to move into this new big house to live in a more refined neighborhood so his daughter could meet someone to marry.  Well, while playing baseball and then trying to keep her brother (Billy Gray, ""Father Knows Best"" tv series 1954-60) out of trouble with the new neighbor kid, she meets Gordon MacRae in the worst way, and even gets a spanking from him.  This leads to her first time in an evening dress and afirst date.  A nice , cordial romance begins.

502955,4,6302728371,"By 1951 Doris Day had become one of the most valuable assets at Warner Brothers. She was their number one female box-office draw and as a follow-up to her hugely popular 1950 musical with Gordon MacRae, ""Tea for Two"" the pair were teamed up again (their 3rd teaming in fact) in the technicolor ""On Moonlight Bay"".
Loosely based on the ""Penrod"" tales by Booth Tarkington, ""Bay"" is a nostalgic, lovingly created look at small town Americana, a world that might not have existed quite as it is depicted but a place we'd like to believe really was.
Doris Day is a tomboy, more at home on the baseball field or fixing a car than in a dress.  The arrival of the boy next door changes some of that, though not all. Her precocious brother Wesley is the devil incarnate.  Mom and Dad spend a lot of time scratching their heads in bemused wonderment at their youngsters antics, and the family maid is erascible but likeable. It's all tied up with gorgeous technicolor photography and a lot of lovely music.
Some critics have carped that it's Warners version of ""Meet Me in St. Louis"" but ""On Moonlight Bay"" can stand on its own merits thanks to a great cast and some genuinely sweet and funny moments.
Doris is perfect as Marjorie, effectively balancing the tomboy and blossoming young lady elements of her character and singing in that gorgeous voice that is distinctly her own.  Gordon MacRae is stalwart as the object of her affection and it's obvious that the two have a genuine feeling for one another.  They remained good friends until his untimely passing.  Their rendition of ""Till We Meet Again"" is outstanding.
It's easy to believe that the cast is really a family.  Leon Ames and Rosemary DeCamp as the parents are warmly winning. In 1984 I had the pleasure of joining Miss DeCamp and her husband, a retired California Judge at an awards dinner and we talked about this film among others and she glowed as she discussed the on-set atmosphere and interactions of the cast.
Bill Gray (of ""Father Knows best"" fame) is delightful and funny as Wesley, and who could have played the family maid better than Mary Wickes. This was the 1st of 4 on-screen roles opposite Day who was a lifelong friend.  In addition Wickes did a very funny guest shot on Day's CBS Television series in 1969.
""On Moonlight Bay"" was such a huge success for Warners that two years later they reteamed most of the cast for an equally popular sequel, ""By the Light of the Silvery Moon"".
Take a sail on Moonlight Bay and you'll be surprised at how much you enjoy the trip.",1008115200,55,2539,4.591611479028698
