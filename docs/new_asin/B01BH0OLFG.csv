8750103,5,B01BH0OLFG,"I must say, that I always viewed WWI as just a horrific war that eventually led to WWII. Yes, it is accurate, but Reynold's documentary illustrated how the shadow of the Great War led to much more. I especially like, episode 2 ""Ballots and Bombs."" Being an American, I found his portrayal how the British navigated the tumultuous period between the Wars: Stanley Baldwin (Conservative) and Ramsey McDonald (Labor) as prime ministers made sure the ""Center"" held in the UK. There is much the US could have learned from the Brits before and after WWII: Breaking up the large estates to make room for housing (Baldwin C.) and after WWII the introduction of universal health care by Atlee (L) with a capitalist spin. I also really appreciated his tie into the 'European Spring' (1918) and the 'Arab Spring' (2011), I never saw that connection before...and it makes sense. Loved his play on Wilson's phrase 'Making the World safe for Democracy' to 'Making Democracy safe for the World.' I would have loved having Reynold's for one of my history professors when I was in college. I fear, that the 'Center' is fraying today in both US and UK.",1522627200,2,1134,4.761421319796955
8750104,5,B01BH0OLFG,"I really liked these episodes. David Reynolds doesn't get bogged down in individual battles like so many documentaries ,instead he leads you through what was going on during WWI ,what the ""leaders""we're thinking and not thinking about (like how many men they were killing ..."" just pins on  a map"".This is a very British point of view from a British history professor .I'm sure his students clamor to get into his lectures. Oh and yeah Woodrow Wilson was horrible but all Europe saw was ""Making the world safe for democracy"",scared the hell out of them.",1520121600,,553,4.821052631578947

8750106,4,B01BH0OLFG,"I stumbled onto Reynolds' documentaries on Netflix into which I have become somewhat absorbed  while walking on my treadmill. However this creditable series gave me pause in a couple places where he takes the democratic pretensions of Woodrow Wilson, a virulent racist and imperialist, at face value, to say nothing of his charitable reference to George W. Bush and Iraq in a similar vein; but his failure to discuss-or even mention-the 1990s civil war in the former Yugoslavia, where the Great War started, as a most recent and blatant legacy of that conflict was quite disappointing.",1501545600,4,585,5.09375
8750107,5,B01BH0OLFG,"As far as documentaries go this is an extremely good one. I have enjoyed David Reynolds documentaries, he adds a bit of humor and theatre to each one. I'm sure he is a dynamic teacher at Cambridge. I love history, and I'm glad I found this source to learn more about it. This program even manages to make political science very interesting.  David Reynolds is a great communicator, and if you are interested in WWI, treaty of Versilles, or political science, this is not to be missed.",1493596800,,484,4.563218390804598
