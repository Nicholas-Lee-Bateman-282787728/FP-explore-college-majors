3744476,3,B001P9N94E,"I know I liked the first Butterfly Effect, and can't even remember the second one. But as far as I can tell, I think the negative reviews are coming from either those who won't accept Kevin Costner is in the movie, or it has nothing to do with the first one.

I just tried to watch it as a movie on it's own, and it seemed like a decent flick about a guy who can somehow time travel when he takes a cold bath. Nothing explains how he can do this, so i guess some reviewers didn't catch on quick enough. The plot is that of this guy who starts off by helping the cops as a sort of psychic helping catch criminals until he is asked to help with a friend of his murder. Each time he goes back, when he wakes up in the present, something has changed that he seems to have caused. Only some things are getting really confusing for him and he can't figure out why, or why each time he comes back the police seem to be more convinced he is a murderer.

It's not exactly an original concept, it's been seen in many movies on the theory that if you could travel back in time, and you changed something, it could alter history forever. But it's a decent flick to see done in a little suspense/action movie with no science fiction babble behind it.

Worthy of a rental or watch it on TV if its on at least.",1250899200,2,1295,4.070588235294117
3744477,4,B001P9N94E,"I happen to like the first one, and suprisingly, liked the second one.  I'm not going to go to great lengths to convince you that the 3rd in the series is a good watch, but give it a chance.  Maybe not purchase it before seeing it, like I did...but I wasn't disappointed.

Let's just say that if you liked the storyline of the first one, give it a chance.  I actually liked the 3rd one more than the 2nd.  It's kind of like Butterfly Effect meets Saw.  There's much more gore in this one than both BE previous.

It's at least worth a rent....at least!",1242518400,7,551,4.190476190476191
3744478,2,B001P9N94E,"When you pick up any of the 8 films to die for, you realize you're not going to be in for an exactly oscar winning performance. Nowhere is this more implied than with The Butterfly Effect 3. Sam, a psuedo detective worknig for the police, has a strict ""observe and report"" outlook on murder, using his TARDIS like abilities to be able to travel back to any point in his life, and presumably to any point where he could easily reached, as he did not find out who any number of assassins or lotto numbers were. Several people, including a physics professor and his little sister are aware of his abilities, trying to reinforce the simple rule than he can't fix things. He responds several times by screaming repeatedly ""I can fix this!"" leading to the movies downward spiral. Starting from his attempt to save his ex-girlfriend, he sets off the actions of a serial killer, invariably drawing the police closer and closer to himself.

The acting in this is hand and fist above most direct to DVD. There are quite a few scenes that give it the flavor of a soft core porn or a much worse direct to video, but if you can gloss over these homicidal drop-ins, the movie is tolerable, though you can guess with near certainty the outcome. The ending breaks aware from cookie-cutter somewhat, but feels bland and boring. Some good gore and blood without being a nightmare on elm street or friday the 13th make this a solid rent, though there are portions you have to skip. Overall, nothing worth writing home about, but leagues and bound above a Pulse 3 or a Jeffersons.",1239494400,2,1560,4.551601423487544
3744479,1,B001P9N94E,"Don't do plot synopsis, but if I did, it wouldn't be worth it on this piece of cow dung!

This was the first After Dark Horrorfest III dvd that I watched.  I bought all eight of them at Best Buy(you can get the set for [...], but you have to buy all eight).  You may be asking why I would choose to watch Butterfly Effect 3: Revelations first?  Is it because I was so blown away and enthralled by the first Butterfly Effect I had to see what part 3 held, despite it having none of the original's characters and only the original's gimmick?  Could it be because I decidedly skipped the direct-to-video sequel, aptly titled The Butterfly Effect II, because the original film left me with no desire for another, and the fact that its plot didn't really warrant a sequel?  Is it because I saw this film in theaters and was so blown away by its greatness that I had to watch it first, despite the fact that I already saw it and didn't see the other seven films?  Well, the correct answer would be, none of the above dear reader.  The real reason I watched this one first is because I had some sort of supernatural sneaking suspicion that it would suck.  I don't know why, but I could feel it in my bones, like when it rains and your bum knee starts to ache.  I was right, but it was worse then even I could have guessed.  Luckily, I sold it back to FYE and made six bucks, which basically means I didn't lose any money on this piece of crap.

The After Dark Horrorfest films are a tricky lot.  It's not bad though.  The films end up being either flawed but good, or just plain good.  Nothing resembling greatness with the exception of The Hamiltons and The Seven Deaths of Ian Stone.  Only 5 Horrorfest films were so horrible that I had to export them out of my collection, Crazy Eights, Wicked Little Things, Unearthed, Butterfly Effect 3, and absolutely dreadful Lake Dead(how's that for an original and subtle title for a film?).  And I grade on a curve, I found redeeming qualities in the poorly made and ultimately silly Nightmare Man!!!!  I say all of this just to give you a reference of where I'm coming from when it comes to low budget horror fare.

This movie is basically a hybrid of the gimmick from the first film and every over-the-top 80's slasher film you ever saw.  It has the time travel from the first film, and the slasher gimmicks of gory deaths, and the secret unseen or masked slasher(the killer in the this film uses a buzz saw.  Do they have cable free saws, or did the killer have to find a convenient place to plug it in before every murder?).  This isn't really technically a sequel, it would be more aptly titled a spin-off.  Even the rules of the time travel from the first film are different.  Unless my memory betrays me, or I just don't care that much because Butterfly Effect wasn't that great a film, but I thought every time Ashton Kutcher changed the past and returned to the present he would receive a head rush of all the new memories.  In this film, for the convenience of the plot, the main character doesn't remember his new life created by his altering of the past.  If he did, the film's conclusion would've happened in the first act.  Whatever....

I'll just get to the point.  The film's flaws are too numerous to list, but I'll give it the 'ol college try regardless.  I'm no prude when it comes to gore, I've stated as much in previous reviews, but this film uses it all wrong.  There is a murder scene involving a sexy bar tender that is tonally wrong for this film.  Her finger is sliced off and it slams into the 'on' button of a stero which blasts on rock music.  Then, we cut to a cop dipping a French fry into a cup of ketchup.  Get it?  Yeah, if this was Evil Dead or Dead Alive or some sort of Troma film this would've been very inventive and macabre.  In this film, which has such a stark and serious tone, followed with equally somber acting, it makes no sense and takes you out of the film, but at this point in the 'plot' I doubt anyone would be that invested in the goings on.  Also, I have nothing against sex in film but the one in this is absolutely retarded.  It involves the same bar tender.  She isn't a character of consequence to the plot, and the main protagonist doesn't even know her.  They meet and then they screw.  Fine, nothing wrong with that, but the scene is given much detail and runs as long as an average soft core scene in any skinemax flick.  There's an emotinal revelation at the end of the scene, but the sex stuff just seems tacked on for the mouth-breathers to put in their spank bank.  Not sexy.  Not necessary.  Again, takes you out of the narrative.  If the film had been toned to be good trashy, exploitative fun it would've been welcomed.  I am, after all, a huge Roger Corman fan.  As per usual the characters aren't intersting, they're just names and faces used to push the plot along.  There's a sub-plot involving our time traveling protagonist working with the police to find killers.  How would the cops be able to prosecute these killers without evidence beyond a psychic?  What precinct would allow such a thing to be a regular tool in solving major crimes?  Dont know, but the movie doesn't bother to supply answers or reasons for this. Finally, the plot is easily figured out in the first act.  You'll know who the killer is and why within thirty minutes.  This would've been a forgiveable offense if the journey had been done in an entertaining or original way. AAAGGGHHHH, I can't go on.  That should be enough faults for anyone to avoid this piece of filth.

Rachel Miner plays the main characters 'disturbed' sister(hint, hint) who he saved from a fire by going back in time.  Unfortunately, this change caused their parents to take her place.  Rachel Miner, an actress that I do find to be talented, is terrible in this film.  Her performance is a sleep walk.  She looks as interested in the material as the viewer, which is none.  Chris Carmack actually does an admirable job at being convincing with such silly and stupid material.  He has to play a character with no arch or pesonality, but he manages to come off convincing and real.

On the plus side, and the plus side is very shallow in this case, the film is shot wonderfully in stark blacks and muted whites and yellows.  It looks like the most polished of polished turds.  Okay, this one is really shallow, the female bar tender(who also appears on the Miss Horrorfest webisodes) is absolutely and totally hot!  Despite the gratuitous and pointless nature of her sex and nude scene, I was thankful for it.  She is quite the specimen of female perfection and I see the reason for her nudity, despite the bad storytelling aspect of it.  The violence is brutal but also manages to be ineffective.  It's just gross.  Watch the opening murder, and you'll see what I mean.  It takes a special level of ineptitude to make a mother being bashed repeatedly in the head in front of her child ineffective.  Wow, I tried to find positives, but I've failed.  Sorry.

Don't see the movie, or at least just rent it, or just do what I did.  Get the deal at Best Buy, watch it first, and then sell it back somewhere.",1238716800,,7162,4.410687022900763
3744480,2,B001P9N94E,"Stupidity plays a great role in thrillers but this time it's just unbelievable.

And what the heck was he thinking when he decided to watch another victim in her closet, come on! How close do you have to get in order to see the killer, in his a$$? While you were there pick up the murder weapon, why don't you, dumb a$$!

3744481,1,B001P9N94E,"Another Butterfly Effect movie?  Really?  Because the overheated Ashton Kutcher-starring original and its direct-to-DVD sequel weren't enough?  What is surprising to me is seeing The Butterfly Effect 3 as part of the After Dark Horrorfest lineup, which finds a young man named Sam (Chris Carmack) doing the whole jumping back in time in order to do some good, only to keep screwing things up in the present.  While the premise was good enough to keep the first film kind of afloat, this time around the whole affair just comes off as being a tedious, uninteresting, and overall confusing bore.  There is little sense to what is going on, and the film doesn't do much to try to hold your interest.  The acting is beyond wooden, even Rachel Miner (starring in another After Dark flick after last year's Tooth & Nail) can't get her character, and her many iterations, quite off the ground.  Even if you enjoyed the first film, The Butterfly Effect 3 is an incredibly hard pill to swallow, and you'll more than likely tune out before it reaches its supposed twist ending, which pretty much negates the whole flick in the first place.",1238457600,3,1129,4.758974358974359
3744482,2,B001P9N94E,"When will these people ever learn? You can't keep going back in time and altering the future without messing everything up. Ashton Kutcher and Eric Lively learned that the hard way in the first two ""Butterfly Effect"" films. Why did no one think to warn Chris Carmack, the star of ""The Butterfly Effect 3: Revelations""? I should think somebody would have, seeing as this ability to jump through time is shared by a surprising number of people. But alas, no one did. Too bad--this is such a dumb movie, so full of holes, so predictable, so lacking any degree of depth or complexity. It's a supernatural thriller that doesn't thrill, a needlessly twisted mystery that builds itself on a premise so weak that I'm amazed it's reached its third chapter.

Those of you who haven't seen the original 2004 film or its direct-to-DVD sequel can rest easy; aside from the whole time-travel gimmick, this new film stands completely alone. This applies to its faults as much as it applies to its plot, which involves a young man from Detroit named Sam Reed (Carmack), who uses his jumping ability to assist the police in catching criminals. How exactly is he able to jump? Not by looking at the pages of a journal, as Kutcher did in the first film, but by lying in a tub full of ice water and thinking about specific dates and times. When he's informed that the man currently behind bars for the murder of his high school sweetheart is innocent, he takes it upon himself to keep going back in time to discover the real killer. There will, of course, be a few unintended side effects, none more problematic than the creation of a serial murder known as the Pontiac Killer, who keeps reappearing in all subsequent jumps and makes Sam look like the primary suspect.

There are so many implausible aspects to this story that I don't know where to begin. Let's start with Sam's sister, Jenna (Rachel Miner). Many years ago, when Sam was only a teenager, Jenna died in a house fire; Sam took care of this by jumping back and saving her, not realizing that the tradeoff would be the death of his parents. Every time Sam makes a jump, Jenna's entire personality is completely altered, going from moody to orderly to domestic. What doesn't change, however, is her remembering the fact that Sam has the ability to jump. It seems unlikely until we reach the end, when a plot twist conveniently explains it away. The twist itself is annoyingly predictable, but the ramifications of the twist are impossible to explain, probably because they don't make any sense.

Herein lies my biggest problem with time travel stories: They're so focused on being clever, but they rarely take plausible ideas into consideration. Sam has altered the future so many times, yet he maintains the exact same relationships, and some even remember what he's able to do. If he keeps going back into the past, isn't it conceivable that certain people will not know of his ability once he returns to the present? Isn't it also conceivable that certain people won't even remember who he is? And why is it that everyone remembers him, yet he awakens in a new present with no knowledge of what life he's now leading? There are those who live for this kind of storytelling, but to be blunt, I have absolutely no idea why. How can anyone watch these kinds of films without bothering to examine the most logical of details? I'm well aware that time travel as a concept doesn't bother too much with logic, but I hold it as an item of faith that a few basic ideas must linger somewhere beneath the surface.

But that only describes a confusing film, not necessarily a bad one. ""The Butterfly Effect 3"" manages to be both, mostly due to the performances, which are no better and no worse than you'd expect from the average high school production. Carmack might have had a chance to actually perform were it not for his role, which is uninteresting in spite of the ability to jump. Sam is not unlike a lot of brooding young men in stories like this, always having something to prove, never stopping to consider the consequences of his actions. It sounds deep and meaningful, but it really isn't, especially in a story this convoluted. And as for Miner, she does the best given the material, although that isn't saying much since her character is nothing more than a horror movie stereotype. I mean this in more ways than one, but to elaborate would give too much away.

If I examine this movie any closer, I fear my head will explode. ""The Butterfly Effect 3: Revelations"" is so misguided that I'm not sure director Seth Grossman or writer Holly Brix know how a supernatural thriller works. The genre title alone pretty much says it all--the audience is supposed to be thrilled. When you have a story that relies on clich characters and an obvious plot twist, you have an unimaginative rehash, not a thriller. And covering up mistakes with complicated notions of time travel isn't going to help much. I recently had a very frustrating experience watching ""Timecrimes,"" a science fiction thriller from Spain that dealt with the implications of time travel; as unpleasant as it was to watch, at least it was able to build suspense. And the story was at least somewhat original. If you're going to watch a bad movie about ripping a hole in the space-time continuum, make sure you choose one with some sense of style.",1231977600,7,5352,4.671261930010605

3744740,3,B001P9N94E,"This 3rd rendition of Butterfly effect follows the life of Sam Reide who uses his gift of time travel to help solve murder cases playing himself off to the police as a psychic.  As a rule of thumb he will not alter the past, only observe, for risk of changing anything too serious, but when the sister of an old flame comes to him with a problem, he does what he swore he wouldn't do and tries to prevent a past murder.  From there all hell breaks loose, the more he keeps trying to go back the worse things get.  I'll try not to get into it too much more than that for risk of giving away spoilers.

Overall the story very dark and more horror movie oriented, and lacks some of the humor that was in the original as well as back story about blackouts.  His method of focusing to do the time travel also varies somewhat than the original as he only needs to focus his thoughts on a particular time period versus having to read past books or notes as in the original movie. The acting overall is good and doesn't feel like the typical cheap or direct to DVD movie.  The actors really get into their roles and do them well.  There are some sexy / raunchy scenes love sex scenes as well which will be very appealing to most male viewers and a surprise ending that will shock and amaze viewers. This movie doesn't seem to be related in any way to the original movies characters as well.  Overall if you're a fan of time travel films, horror or sexy films you will likely enjoy this film.  Those that are looking for something more like a redo of the 1st film may not be quite as happy with it but the film still delivers on the whole Butterfly effect theory or past events altering your present.",1368057600,4,1691,4.242990654205608

Now, he is caught in a deadly game of cat and mouse as each victim he tries to save in the past only leads to more deaths in the future. THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT 3 is more careless than ever when it comes to continuity, and presumes that any audience that is already willing to accept time-travel will blindly buy in to its many plot contrivances. While this is to be expected in a film of its type, the main problem is that there are no real clues left anywhere in time that help to identify the killer. The entire build has only been a set up for the cheap and unforgivable twist in the end. Add to that the weak overall performances from Chris Carmack and the rest of the cast, and it becomes that much easier to avoid THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT 3.

He first went back in time to save his sister from a fire when, but he ended up changing the timeline as his parents die in the fire.

Sam's girlfriend, Rebecca, was murdered a few years before and her sister, Elizabeth, believes that the killer is still out there, which means Rebecca's murderer, that is behind bars and is going to be executed within days, is innocent.

Sam goes back in time to the night of Rebecca's murder, just to see who the killer is, but then he tries to stop her death, only resulting in her being murdered in a different manor. When he returns back to the present, things have changed and he is now a murder suspect in not just Rebecca's death, but in a string of murders. Each time he goes back to find the murderer he changes his current timeline, and one by one his most trusted allies are being murdered.

I have never seen the previous films in the series and after a quick google search, I was surprised to learn that each movie has a different main character and plot. I only watched The Butterfly Effect 3 because it came in a two disc set with seven other After Dark Horrorfest III films. The movie started out a little confusing for me with all the flashbacks, but once I figured out what was going on I was glued to screen. There is a lot of blood/gore throughout the movie, not to mention the graphic sex scene, but deep down there is an intriguing plot that keeps you guessing who the killer really is. Honestly, I didn't have a clue who the killer was until he or she pulled off the mask, which reminds of Jason's feed sack from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Friday-the-13th-Part-2-Deluxe-Edition/dp/B001K9OXE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Friday the 13th, Part 2 (Deluxe Edition)</a>.

3744756,1,B001P9N94E,"Yeah, the title is a quote from the movie.  Be wary, thee, for spoilers abound.

I didn't see the second one, but that's okay because apparently this one is unrelated to that one and obviously the first one.  Without any back story or explanation, the guy in this one can ""jump"" just like the first movie guy.  This time, he's (initially) smart enough to know he can't save people without screwing over other people, and so simply watches the crimes unfold, so he can finger the culprit in the present, and claim he's a psychic and have a perfect record.

His sister knows he can jump, and so does some random guy who is always warning him not to do it and not to interfere and such.  Then one day, the sister of his dead girlfriend appears with a diary revealing that she was cheating on him with the guy who ended up convicted her her murder.  If there was a good reason for what happens next, I completely forgot it, or totally missed it in the movie, but he suddenly decides that the convicted guy ISN'T really guilty, and so goes to the jail to meet him and tell him so, and wants to help him get a new trial based on the girl's diary describing the affair.  The convicted guy shouts that HE (as in, the protagonist) killed her.

He then decides to jump to try to stop her death or something of the sort.  While there, he interrupts what should happen, telling the sister to stay in her car while he goes to check up on his girlfriend.  Except she's dead already, and the person who killed her slips into the car and kills the sister.

Starting here, I should say that, with no real purpose except its own sake, the film is gratuitously gory.  At a level you'd expect from the later Saw movies, except without any real reason to be so gory.  It's not only excruciatingly disgusting, but it's occasionally very distracting from the film.  Also, there's a gratuitous sex scene for roughly the same reason, and to roughly the same effect/reaction.

When he jumps back, he discovers that this person who killed his girlfriend and the sister has now killed eight people, and is called the Pontiac Killer.  From there, he tries various methods to save a victim (and ends up indeed saving her, and getting himself a restraining order issued against him by her) and to find the killer, even trying to catch them.  All the while, the Random Guy who knows about the jumping disappears, and his sister always knows about his jumping.

All the ""evidence"" in the film essentially points to HIM being the killer, losing his mind or something of the sort, and killing the girls.  It gets so gratuitous and obvious, that you expect it to be him, in some way or another, or some sort of plot twist or mindfk the likes of which would never be seen in a hack, C-movie like this.

But said plot twist would require a genius writer to climb out of the hole the plot digs into, with basically NO evidence pointing to ANYONE OTHER than him, the protagonist.  So, out of nowhere, the killer ends up being his sister.  Apparently she's in love with him in an incestuous sort of way, and so she killed his girlfriend and set up the cheating guy to be the murderer, but then the sister threw a wrench into it with the diary, so she had to kill her as well.  The other bunch of women were women the protagonist later met and fell in love with, and which we don't see for the obvious reasons of monotony and time.

This comes out of nowhere, and results in... a very questionable-type solution ending.  Apparently, a house fire had happened at some point in his history, killing his sister.  So he jumped back and saved her, but it ended up killing his parents.  So he jumps again, saves his parents, and... holds the door in on his sister's room, essentially forcing her to stay in and die of smoke inhalation or burn to death.  NICE JOB, HERO!

So the end part jumps to him in a car, going to a barbeque, with his girlfriend now his wife, and a daughter named after his dead sister.  Then the movie makes the full jump to stupid by having the little girl put her doll on the grill and watch it burn with a big smile, I guess implying that the sister was reincarnated into her, or that she's somehow inherited the dead sister's serial-killer tendencies.

The acting overall was lame, and in many cases horribly forced.",1294099200,5,4295,4.411167512690355
3744757,2,B001P9N94E,I watched this movie on cable the other night and have to say that the movie was less than mediocre. It's not the worst film I've ever seen.

3744759,2,B001P9N94E,"The Butterfly Effect 3: Revelations (Seth Grossman, 2009)

There's a Butterfly Effect 3? I wasn't even aware there had been a Butterfly Effect 2. (Turns out, after I did five seconds of research, it was a straight-to-video 2006 release.) In any case, a number of After Dark Horrorfest viewers (those who actually went to the theater to see the usually-awful movies After Dark distributes) said Revelations was their favorite of the ADHF flicks from '09, so I decided I'd watch that one before those no one talked about. (I do admit I watched the two everyone hated first...) And while it's not as good as the original, which was no great shakes but watchable, it's surprisingly not half bad. And the lack of Ashton Kutcher on the screen helps immensely.

Plot: if you've seen one Butterfly Effect movie, you know what's going to happen. Guy is capable of jumping around in time. Guy messes around with his own timeline and causes unexpected changes in his present, which change the parameters of the original mystery guy is trying to solve. In this case, guy is Sam Reade (The O.C.'s Chris Carmack), who is helped in his jaunting by his shut-in sister Jenna (Bully's Rachel Miner), who's been terrified of the outdoors since almost dying in the fire that killed their parents. In any case, Sam is contacted by Elizabeth Brown (American Virgin's Sarah Habel), the sister of Sam's dead ex-girlfriend Rebecca (Mia Serafino in her first screen role). The guy who went down for her murder is scheduled to be executed on Friday, and Elizabeth just knows he didn't do it. She asks Sam to look into it, but that kind of thing is never a good idea. After his jaunt, both Rebecca and Elizabeth are dead, and his meddling has turned a guy who seemingly killed one person at random into a serial killer. With each victim Sam goes back and tries to save, he comes back to a present that's almost unrecognizable (including his apartment actually belonging to someone else, who gets miffed that Sam keeps turning up on his couch out of nowhere).

It's an interesting concept, though I imagine you'd be hard-pressed as a screenwriter not to use it as a cheap way to manipulate the parameters of what it is you're doing rather than simply letting it take its own course. That, to me, is the biggest problem with Holly Brix's script; many of the things that happen are just a shade too convenient, rather than being logical outgrowths of either Sam messing with the flow of time or the killer's identity (and motive). Also, there are a few pieces of the puzzle that remain static while everything else changes for no reason (or, in the case of Sam's friendship with police detective Glenn--which survives a shift that sees Sam going from a police informant to the police's prime suspect for the serial slayings--solely to get around a sticky plot point) when they really ought to change.

Despite all this, I have to admit I liked the movie a good deal more than I expected to, maybe because the actors are actually kind of good at their job, something that's rare in any movie distributed by After Dark. Sure, there are plot holes big enough to send you back in time yourself, but if you can ignore them, it's not awful. **",1263600000,4,3206,4.659010600706714
3744760,3,B001P9N94E,"The time-travelling thriller series continues with ""The Butterfly Effect 3: Revelations"" starring Chris Carmack as Sam, who as a ""psychic"" helps the local police capture the criminals of unsolved cases. The fact is, Sam can travel back to the time the crime is committed and he reports everything that is necessary for the police to arrest the culprit. Very few people know of his special ability, though, and his sister Jenna (Rachel Miner), who assists his time travel, is one of them.

But there is one rule Sam must observe - he may watch, but he should never interfere. But of course he does break the rule when Elizabeth Brown (Sarah Habel) asks him to jump back to 10 years ago. And Elizabeth is the sister of Rebecca Brown (Mia Serafino), Sam's dead girlfriend.

The third installment of the ""Butterfly Effect"" franchise may not be as impressive as the first one, but still ""The Butterfly Effect 3: Revelations"" is surprisingly well-plotted and entertaining. Though the details of the storyline is different from the original, the concept of the protagonist traveling back in time (who makes things more complicated while trying to ""fix"" the past) remains the same. The storyline is full of plot holes, but it surely keeps us guessing what will happen next.

Some parts of the film are pretty gory, and I don't think gores are necessary to tell this story. Also, it takes some time for you to get past the shaky opening chapters, and I think some viewers will foresee the film's ending. Still the third entry is surprisingly good - I mean, surprisingly - and worth watching though the first one remains the best.",1261785600,8,1620,4.799283154121864

3744763,4,B001P9N94E,"As I approached this years 8 Films To Die For, I tried to watch in order of what I expected to be worst to best.  As such, I chose BUTTERFLY EFFECT 3: REVELATIONS as my starting point, because it seemed odd to me to include what is really a Sci-Fi film, and a third entry in an existing franchise into a film festival.  As it turns out, I was pleasantly surprised with this film

The story concerns a man named Sam, who can jump back into his past consciousness and revisit key scenes in his life.  The catch is that changing the past even in the slightest can have devastating effects on the future.  So he has a careful set of rules to follow, that includes never being seen by anyone.  His goal is to view murders as they occur so he can return to the present and tell the police who the killer is.

He himself is the victim of a violent crime, his girlfriend having been brutally killed.  He has been reluctant to visit her murder for fear of being unable to keep himself from trying to prevent it.  However, when his girlfriend's sister suggests to him that the man currently on death row for the crime may in fact be innocent, Sam decides to break the rule and travel back to the scene.  Predictably, he inadvertently involves himself in the moment, and returns to the present to find that, instead of one murder, there is now a string of murders attached to his girlfriend.  He has essentially created a serial killer.  The rest of the film follows Sam as he tries to set things right, climaxing in the titular revelation of the true killer.

Performances rank pretty high, writing is competent, and the film even manages to elicit a few good laughs amidst the otherwise dark tone.  Rachel Miner marks her third appearance in as many Horrorfests, and brings a nice grounded feel to her role as Sam's sister, whom he went back in time to save from their burning home, at the cost of their parents.

With solid acting, excellent camera work, tight pacing and editing, BUTTERFLY EFFECT 3 easily stands near the top of the Afterdark III heap.  Unfortunately, this doesn't seem quite right, as this is NOT a horror film by any stretch.  The film does contain several over-the-top gory kills consistent with a horror film, which might explain the inclusion, but the story is much more in line with science fiction.  For that reason alone, I cannot consider this film in contention for the best of the festival.

Nevertheless, I can recommend it, as it is a top notch thriller.  I could have done without the completely gratuitous porn sex scene, but aside from this, I would give it high marks.",1255132800,3,2595,4.504273504273504
