7854100,2,6303809952,"The vhs copy I had only contained Beast. This reprint was so poor as to be distracting. Sound, production & lighting were terrible.  Pre-war anti-Nazis resisters are betrayed & interred in a concentration camp where they endure beatings & interrogation. Acting leaves something to be desired but it is an early Alan Ladd effort with noble subject manner. It is drama but has a few documentary scenes of Hitler & the Nazis dropped in. The story itself has a happy ending for one of the prisoners & his wife. That quickly dissolves into early scenes of World War II. Madacy Music Group in Canada did a poor reprint job. If the material they had to work with was so poor they needn't have bothered.",1254614400,,695,4.604838709677419
7854101,3,6303809952,"The ""beast"" in ""Beast of Berlin"" refers to Adolf Hitler, though the movie is not about him.  (There was a film made in 1918 titled ""Kaiser-Beast of Berlin"" about World War I, but no prints of that movie are known to exist.)  The existing film was made in 1939 at the beginning of WW2.  Alan Ladd (age 25-26 at the time) has a small speaking part but is listed among the actors in the credits; this was his first ""starring"" role.

The plot concerns Germans who resisted the Nazis by distributing anti-Nazi literature.  The primary characters are a pregnant wife and her husband, who is thrown into a forced labor camp.  Alan Ladd's character also becomes an inmate at the camp.  The tone of the film is anti-Nazi.  I found the sound track a bit difficult to understand; but sound quality might depend on the viewing equipment used.  The film runs 85 minutes.

""Flying Scotsman"" was made in 1929, and was Ray Milland's first film.  (He was 22 at the time.)  He plays a locomotive fireman (stoker) on the London & North Eastern Railway who is also a ""ladies' man.""  At a neighborhood dance hall, he meets and ""falls for"" the daughter of the locomotive engineer (driver) of the Flying Scotsman passenger train.

(That train was the fastest one between London & Edinburgh--394 miles.  The locomotive used in the movie was the 4-6-2 Pacific type # 4472, also named ""Flying Scotsman,"" which has been preserved and still exists today.  It is one of the most famous steam locomotives ever built and certainly the most widely-traveled, having toured both the United States during the 1970s and Australia in 1988.)

In addition to the beginning of a love story, the plot involves the engineer's reporting his first fireman for being drunk on duty, which results in his being fired and vowing revenge.  Milland's character gets the job as replacement fireman on the next run.  The former fireman boards the train to exact his revenge & is followed by the engineer's daughter just as the train departs.

The film runs about 60 minutes.  It began as a silent movie with subtitles, but sound technology developed during production.  Thus a sound track commences about 31 minutes into the movie.  Aside from a few scenes at the beginning of the film, most of the railroad action occurs during the last 10-12 minutes of the movie.  While most viewers will probably regard the action as ""corny"" by today's standards, the railroad stunts are similar to those in American-made silent ""thrillers"" and serials during the 19-teens and -twenties.  Railway and locomotive enthusiasts might likely enjoy this film more than others.",1240185600,2,2605,4.826185101580135
