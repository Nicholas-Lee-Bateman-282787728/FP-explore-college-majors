2361567,5,B000A5EIPI,"Very powerfull Play.. You have to watch it at least 5 times each time you will get something new out of it. Its for teenagers, adults, anyone..

I often find my self thinking about this play at work or while driving down the street. This play will make you do some soul searching..

2361588,1,B000A5EIPI,"This video is messed up. It would not play on my DVD player, and would barely play on my computer. I had to work on it a while to get it to play at all. I would not recommend this to anyone to purchase.",1275004800,,202,3.6136363636363638
2361599,5,B000A5EIPI,"This is an outstanding depiction of Hell's residents. I believe it to be a spiritual awakening just like the movie,""Tales from the Hood"" is for those who watch these dvds.  This, by far,IS A REALITY CHECK!!!!!  Our souls have only two choices, Heaven or Hell?  It's YOUR FREEWILL CHOICE.  What in Hell, Do YOU WANT?",1268006400,,315,4.672727272727273

2361601,2,B000A5EIPI,"I read the reviews for this play and expected a little more. The concept of the play was great but the flow was not. The music could have been totally left out and I woud have enjoyed it more. I've seen many plays which included Tony Grant so I did have expectations for the caliber of this play and was left disappointed. If I would have seen a preview of this play, I would probably have not purchased the DVD.",1259452800,,412,4.1625
2361602,1,B000A5EIPI,This is a awful stage play I would not waste another dime on this stage play it has no meaning or depth to what the play is about. Don't buy it you would be throwing away 10 bucks plus shipping. it is not worth it.,1254096000,,214,3.7777777777777777
2361603,3,B000A5EIPI,"I saw scenes of this play on YouTube and I thought that it would be a good movie for my family to watch but, after seeing the whole play I had to loan it to some of my church family members to watch because, it really put something our your minds. Although the play can become a little bit campy at times the overall message hits home. I enjoyed everything about the play except the celebrity appearance at the end. (Shirley Murdock)She didn't fit into the plot at all! Tony Grant and the rest of the cast members carried the play all the way home for me.

So, on that note I'll still give it 2 thumbs up!",1244160000,,605,4.127118644067797
2361604,5,B000A5EIPI,WONDERFUL PLAY!!! i truely enjoyed it from beginning to end! wonderful storyline. the cast had great chemistry together. AWSOME message! a definate must have for my collection.,1175299200,,176,5.555555555555555
2361605,5,B000A5EIPI,"I reeeal enjoyed this video.

It left me thinking about my own eternal state. It could sure be used as a very powerful witnessing tool, after I watched it, I invited several people in my life over for a viewing and discussion.",1173139200,,226,4.380952380952381
2361606,5,B000A5EIPI,"I normally don't comment on reviews, or leave reviews at all, but I had to comment on this horrible review because it is absolutely ridiculous! I own this dvd and it is one of the most fascinating, spell-binding, and intriguing gospel plays I have seen to date! The story is impactful, thrilling, and heart-wrenching. Each characters story is not only heartfelt, it is believeable and realistic. The play points out all of the reasons why you would not want to go to hell, and what your eternity will be. The songs are so strong and beautiful! The cast and vocalists were so amazing! It was truly like watching a Broadway show! I feel so blessed to have seen this show, and have given it to many others to experience. Anyone and everyone should see this play because they will feel a change after they see it. The previous review tells some of the story, but nowhere to the extent that the show deserves credit for. This play is so powerful, and if you love the Lord like I do, then this play will inspire and touch you. Please purchase this play as soon as possible and share it with everyone you know! It is definitely worth every dime. This play deserves 200% credit for how amazing and well staged it is. Everyone all over the world needs to see it!",1169510400,4,1253,4.452173913043478
2361607,3,B000A5EIPI,"This play literally asks the question: ""What in hell do you want?""

In other words: ""What is it about hell that you find so enticing, so alluring that you would do anything you can in this life in order to go THERE forever?""

And, I don't want to give anything away, but it does make the point that (for instance) the alcoholic won't find anything to drink in hell & yet he will have to endure that horrible craving FOREVER ...

Which is not something I ever thought about before -- that hell might be all about eternally NOT getting whatever bad things I sought after in this life FOREVER ...

Which means that the underlying message of the play is that this life is a test (which I whole-heartedly agree with) & that the choices we make in this life affect what we will reap in the afterlife ...

Overall, I liked the play okay (just okay), but none of the music really grabbed me & I ended up doing housework while watching this, so I guess I'd have to say that I wasn't really enthralled by the whole thing?",1167350400,3,1011,4.272251308900524
2361608,4,B000A5EIPI,"This play was very good.  It begins with a Sunday Church service beginning like it does every Sunday with one difference, the minister passing out.  It goes on to show that the minister goes to Hell and the things he sees there.  He comes back to life and now knows that you've either got to be hot or cold in ministering to the people.  God does not want you to tell the people what they want to hear, you've got to tell them exactly what will save their souls and get them on the Lord's side.  There was only one thing that I did not like; I saw this play starring Clifton Davis and Shirley Murdock.  After the play was over, I bought the DVD; I was very disappointed because it starred David Whitfield (?).",1151193600,5,709,4.214814814814815
