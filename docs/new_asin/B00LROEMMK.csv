To think that these two people conducted this type of a study during the 1950's and 1960's is intriguing. Pioneers of Sex Research is an understatement. Lizzy Caplan steps out of her comedic role and takes on Virginia Johnson with Poise and Accuracy. She is absolutely perfect in this role. Michael Sheen as William Masters is so complex and he plays him with vulnerability to a point, only allowing glimpses into the true character.
I have never been so compelled by a series in my life. Congratulations to Michelle Ashford and the entire cast, on a provocative and brilliant show!",1425340800,,709,4.867768595041323
