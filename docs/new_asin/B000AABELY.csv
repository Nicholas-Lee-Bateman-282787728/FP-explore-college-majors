8076984,3,B000AABELY,"Please note: same movie as The Volcano Disaster.  See description of video under that name.  See reviews of movie under that title.  I agree with many of the reviewers, strange movie.  Not much volcano action except a bit at beginning and end.  More of search for information regarding his wife who died early in movie.  A touch of the eerie and the supernatural.  I found it so boring, did not get past the first 30 minutes or so.  Donated the movie to Goodwill.  If I had known the Nature Unleashed: Volcano and The Volcano Disaster were the same movie would not have purchased it.",1436054400,,583,4.528846153846154
