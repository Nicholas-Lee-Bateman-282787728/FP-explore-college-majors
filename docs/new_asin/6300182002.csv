221533,4,6300182002,"After, Incredible Hulk, Amazing Spider-man and Doctor Strange, Captain America got his pilot movie. This version his very different from the comic book character. Steve Rogers is an ex-US marine. Instead of being the real  Captain america, Steve Rogers is the son of Captain Who has been killed by  gansters. After an accident, he was inject with a Super-steroid called  ""FLAG""(Full latent ability gain). Also, the first costume is very  different from the comic-book. Intead of a cowl, he has a helmet and the  wings are painted on it and his shield is transparent. Although this is  different from the comic, Comic-books fan should see this movie.",960768000,4,649,5.018691588785047
221534,5,6300182002,"I have to admit this Moive was a bit strange, But if you are a captain america lover, you gotta see this. the way Steve became Captain America was different from the comic but similer. If you like old Marvel Films you  gotta see this!",954288000,,234,4.2
221535,5,6300182002,It may be a little cheesy but this one is still much more fun and entertaining than the pitiful straight to video motion picture that was made.  Besides this one comes from the late 70s when action films were more  fun.  I recommend it if you liked the Spider Man movies and the Incredible  Hulk television series.,953337600,,314,4.456140350877193
221536,3,6300182002,"Hate to say, but you guys who reviewed this movie before me got the wrong show. That was the 1992 movie you reviewed. This flick here is a 1978-ish made for TV movie, starring Reb Brown. It came out about the same time as  those campy Spiderman movies starring Nicholas Hammond. Anyway. This movie  ain't much better than the '92 one. The '92 one at least had the origin  right. In this one, Steve Rogers receives an experimental serum that makes  him Captain America. He takes on some bad guys who have an atomic bomb. Not  a bad flick if you saw it as a kid and wanted to relive part of your  childhood, but if you saw it nowadays, you'd think the '92 movie should get  an Academy Award.",917740800,,689,4.253846153846154

7804507,2,6300182002,"Thats right. This lame late 70s TV movie has about an hour of boredom and then the guy finally puts on the Captain America costume and fights.  Up until that point the film is tedious beyond explanation.  Directed by Ron Holcomb who did shows like A-Team, Battlestar Galactica, Fantasy Island, and Quincy.  Cap is like a boring Quincy episode until the action starts an hour later, then its like A Team.  This is extremely small budget and corny, but not in a good way.  Captain America does have a cool motorcycle and a van, but most people did in the 70s.  6'3"" Reb Brown fits the role physically, but he can't act and is more like a football player than Captain America.  Look out for Steve Forrest from the 70s show SWAT.  There is actually a sequel called ""Death too soon"" which pulled out the acting talents of Connie Selleca (TVs HOTEL!  Woopee!) and horror legend Christopher Lee who is awesome, but no stranger to camp/cheese.  I can't speak for the sequel because after this first one, I didn't bother.  This one is 2 hours long with maybe 20 minutes of Captain America in costume.  What?  Still, in comparison to the other film version of Captain America from 1991...what a disaster, the 70s version isn't so bad.  Still this '79 movie is mostly boring and slow until Captain America appears and even then its like ""thats it?"".",1062288000,4,1338,4.590717299578059
7804508,4,6300182002,"This video is based on the TV series of Captain america that originally aired on CBS(if I remember correctly) which stars Reb Brown as the Captain. Although, it has very little to do with the comic book(the 1989 movie had alot more to do with it,really)- it is still an entertaining movie worth getting and checking out. Just for a walk down memory lane. It's pretty awesome to watch. I highly recommend it to all.",1045958400,4,414,4.533333333333333
