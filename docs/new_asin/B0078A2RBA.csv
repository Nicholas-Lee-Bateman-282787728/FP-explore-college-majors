8512291,3,B0078A2RBA,"Same as last review. For some reason leaving Marks show uncut was not done. I would and did paid a high price for a show of someone amazing and stands alone perfect as it goes.  I won't buy anymore of Mark's DVD' s because I love his whole show, when they chopped off a lot of it it's not as meaningful or as funny.  Have seen Mark perform at Harvey's Comedy club in portland, Oregon and at conventions and chopping off pieces of his act seems to have lessened the greatness of Mark's gift. Sorry but no way would I have paid $30. each if i'd known they weren't uncut first. He's funnier and with more heart when it's a complete show. Cutting him off in many of his acts ruins the entire experience. WE LOVE MARK AND HIS FULL COMEDY AND RECOVERING PERFORMANCES...but these 2 DVD' s don't show his gift or do him justice.",1428969600,2,820,4.25

8512294,5,B0078A2RBA,This guy has keyed into the tragic hilariousness of addiction and the life that results from altered reality and lots of turpentine.,1381536000,,132,5.045454545454546
8512295,3,B0078A2RBA,"This video is okay, but not as good as his Humor in Treatment. I am hoping that his Addicted DVD is better.",1380844800,,107,3.909090909090909
8512296,3,B0078A2RBA,Mark's routine is great as usual.  The problem was that the DVD case states that it is a run time of 90 minutes.  Mark's routine is only around 35 minutes and even with the limited special features doesn't have a run time of even 1 hour.  Expected a lot more of the stand-up for the money.,1378684800,,289,4.125
