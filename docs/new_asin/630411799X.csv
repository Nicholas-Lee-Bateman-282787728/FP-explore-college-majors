780780,3,630411799X,"For those of us who cannot get enough of this era of film-making, or of the English of yore, or the impeccable acting talents of British actors, this movie works its magic. As a script, it is a reworking of so many in which a man finds himself facing a jury after a series of mishaps. At the dnouement, the viewer is left to reason for himself what happens because the concluding few minutes of the storyline are a complete muddle. Even the newspaper headline, which is supposed to enlighten the viewer, is cut off at the right-hand side where the operative words are printed. The title is no less abstruse than the ending and can only be guessed by applying a metaphor of one's choosing. For this confusion and for all its ordinariness, the noir-style photography, the acting, the brisk pace of it all, makes the film an enjoyable treat.",1359331200,7,838,4.556291390728477
780781,5,630411799X,"LILLI PALMER is gorgeous and very believable as REX HARRISON'S wronged wife. A rare little gem from Sinister Cinema, not digitally restored but still very watchable quality.  There's a neat little twist in the tail, too!",1293667200,10,220,5.111111111111111
780782,4,630411799X,A married man cheats on his wife with a showgirl. When she is murdered the police think he killed her & he is running scared.,1265846400,7,125,4.04
780783,5,630411799X,"I have to agree with the New York Times reviewer who called this film ""a tidy little murder drama"" and added that it was ""an unusually literate and impressively acted film.""  It is all of that.

Rex Harrison personally produced the film along with the famous screenwriter Nunnally Johnson.

Good music, good writing, good photography and great acting are what gives this little gem its distinction.  The ""film noir"" look is beautiful to see and the performances of all the players are of the very first class.  Britain was awash at the time with highly talented movie makers in front of and behind the cameras, so almost any film from that period has interest.

There is an excellent courtroom scene in which the prosecuting attorney is beautifully played by the great Denis O'Dea, while the defense attorney part is equally well done by co-director Anthony Bushell.  It's a nice sequence.

As the wife who stands by her flawed man, Lilli Palmer gives another of her sensitive, touching performances.  She was in a class by herself.  She was always good, but stood out in many films like THE RAKE'S PROGRESS (NOTORIOUS GENTLEMAN in the USA), THE LONG DARK HALL and most impressive of all, THE COUNTERFEIT TRAITOR.  Modern actresses could learn a thing or two (or three or four) from this superb artiste.

A very good film worth seeing.  A pity the only videos available are quite poor-quality affairs which sadly detract from the visual impact of the picture.  One can only hope that this will be rectified one day soon.

Highly recommended.",1235001600,17,1541,4.82824427480916
780784,4,630411799X,"You wonder how the two stars could face each other playing the parts they did, only a few years after Rex Harrison was caught with his pants down and Carole Landis lay tragically dead, a suicide?  Lilli Palmer stuck by her man and she and ""Sexy Rexy"" were banished from Hollywood--at the time, people thought, forever.

Here they play a married man with a gorgeous wife who just can't keep from straying.  He's having a passionate affair with a young showgirl, who just happens to wind up murdered, and because his knife is left at the scene of the crime, a seedy theatrical boarding house run by Brenda de Banzie, the coppers come for him, shocking his wife.  Lilli's parents come to survey the emotional wreackage left in the wake of the revelation of Rex's affair.  Funny how she's German of course, but she has conventional English parents (no explanation given for her wobbly accent).

The real killer is disclosed early on, and he becomes obsessed with Lilli Palmer and manages to insert himself into her life little by little.  This is the chilling, creepy part of the movie, quite suspenseful, but most of the picture is a kind of dull trial drama set in a frame story of an American anti-capital punishment journalist who begs his UK confrere for one last story to use as the final setpiece in a book he's writing about unfairly condemned men.  ""I've got just the case for you, old chap, the Rex Harrison story,"" and the movie begins.  In a sense THE LONG DARK HALL is a replay of Hitchcock's THE PARADINE CASE, and they probably skimped by using the same Old Bailey set and the same motheaten barrister wigs and robes.

Rex seems to be acting out the tortures of the damned, while Lilli sometimes wears a look on her face that says, serves him right, the cheating schweinhund.  The ""long dark hall"" of the title is strangely underused, considering it's pretty atmospheric and positively cries out for a second scene in which the killer tries to strangle Lilli Palmer there.  Alas no!  Nonetheless it's a hardcore noir affair and well worth watching for its damned-if-you-do, nobody-cares attitude towards individual fate and collective responsibility.",1179619200,7,2161,4.776881720430108
780785,3,630411799X,"Although this film has some curious similarities with the real life of 2 of its major actors ( Harrison and Palmer ) it's not really good enough to merit serious attention otherwise. The plot is very B movie and melodramatic and the acting by modern standards pretty wooden. The true relationship between Harrison and his lover is fatally never fully described, though this is more the fault of prevailing social censorship than anything, with the consequence that Palmer's dogged devotion to her husband appears merely conventional. A pity because there was the chance of a really good movie here. A case for a remake?",1155168000,,619,4.961538461538462

7861780,5,630411799X,"Although I'm a classic movie buff, I didn't remember this movie by title, but remembered seeing it years ago only once. The title threw me off, and I didn't really see it as fitting the plot at all. Nonetheless, I truly enjoyed watching this movie and recommend it to others who appreciate great classics featuring great actors such as Rex Harrison.  I'd now like to add it to my enormous collection of B/W classics.  Would you please offer the rental of ""Miracle in the Rain,"" featuring Van Johnson and Jane Wyman?",1487030400,2,515,4.648351648351649
