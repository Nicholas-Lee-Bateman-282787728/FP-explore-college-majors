8224959,2,B000WPJT3W,"Set was bought with other dvds and properly packed for shipping. When I eventually got to watch this set, the three dvd cases were plastic wrapped together with an outer label. After removing the wrapping I found the first case cracked on the bottom at the back of the case, almost to the spine, and the disc was loose. The disc was very scratched up and the first episode would not play at all past 4 minutes and the second episode stalled for a time before resuming. Since this case was on top in the pack, the damage had to be made prior to wrapping the three cases together since damage would be unlikely to occur in that area with the cases bundled together as they were.
Only two stars for poor judgement in sending a damaged product. I enjoyed the episodes I did get to see, but there are only 4 episodes per disc and not being able to see 25% of the first disc made this a bad purchase.",1449446400,,894,4.233918128654971

8224962,5,B000WPJT3W,These stories are from true cases. Has a business like flavor. No rouge cops no cops threatening people. More like real life.,1371945600,2,125,4.7272727272727275
8224963,4,B000WPJT3W,"The dvds were fun to watch.  The quality is good.  I enjoy watching old, black and white shows so these were good for me.",1315785600,4,121,4.0
8224964,5,B000WPJT3W,"This is one of the best old TV series. At least as far as 1950's 'cop and robber' shows went. And that says a lot because there were lots of them! I grew up watching them all (as fast as I could turn two channels - that's all we had). 'The Naked City' was good too, but the prices are still high on those. These are great bargains. And I like reality...and if I'm not mistaken...these are based on true stories.",1248307200,10,411,4.08641975308642
