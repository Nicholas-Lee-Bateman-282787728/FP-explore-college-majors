8494079,4,B0066E6U7Q,"Review of The Great Sinner
Hot Toasty Rag, August 8, 2017

Before Gregory Peck played heroes in movies about American integrity, he took a few villainous, or at least troubled, roles. In The Great Sinner, Greg plays a compulsive gambler, and he gives a wonderful performance.

At first, hes just a writer who wants to write about the incredible sickness of gambling, but before long, he finds out firsthand how the sickness can take over a mans life. What I love most about this movie is the realism of the script and performances. Ive heard this movie compared to The Lost Weekend, a movie about alcoholism, but I found The Great Sinner to be much more realistic in its portrayal of addiction. Gregs performance is fantastic, and its great to see the contrast of how he was before he started gambling. As the movie continues, he becomes desperate, cruel, and self-loathing. Many times Hollywood shows the glitz and glamour associated with gambling, but since this is a period piece, theres no neon lights or Las Vegas strip. Its in black-and-white, its dirty without being filthy, it warns without becoming melodramatic, and its heart-wrenching.

Greg is flanked by an all-star supporting cast, including Melvyn Douglas, Ethel Barrymore, Frank Morgan, Agnes Moorehead, Walter Huston, and his favorite leading lady Ava Gardner.  I don't usually like Ava Gardner, but this movie is an exception. I highly recommend it.",1502150400,,1417,5.017021276595744

8494085,4,B0066E6U7Q,"Hollywood's version of ""The Gambler"" demonstrates just how insidious a gambling addiction can be.  Both Ava and Gregory Peck go to great lengths to show the emotional and financial tragedies that can ensue when they get out of control.  Well acted by both with Melvin Douglas adding the villain's touch.",1402358400,9,303,5.04
8494086,5,B0066E6U7Q,"This movie accurately portrays the cost, both financial and emotional, that excessive if not uncontrollable gambling has on those who believe (wrongly) that it is anything but a vice.  Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner are both excellent in their opposite roles.  He, the gentleman who initially preaches restraint.  Her, the iconic beauty who ultimately leads him directly into the fire.  The story also takes other turns with moments of ""spiritual"" interaction and soul-searching brought on by awkardness---all of it related to the self, inner conflict gamblers experience with the ""rush"" of wagering.",1392076800,9,598,5.467391304347826
