Wouldn't recommend to a friend because not an enjoyable and interesting tour video.,1375142400,,254,4.795454545454546
8406940,5,B003VOVW5O,I Love Mexico and this Blue-ray Disc has a lot of good information bout The Major Big Cities Rudy Maxa Explores. Very well done.,1365984000,2,128,4.375
8406941,5,B003VOVW5O,"My favorite places to vacation are Mexico and Greece. I love to ride the ferries to the Greek islands in the summer and visit the Mayan and Aztec cities in the winter. I spent many years working in Latin America and like to practice my Spanish.
In Beautiful Mexico Rudy Maxa visits Guadalajara, Mexico City,Puerto Vallarta and Zihuatanejo. The last two are resort areas developed by the Mexican government along with Cancun to attract American tourists. Guadalajara and Mexico City are big cities where mariachi bands will serenade you.
I recommend a trip to the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City's Chapultepec Park where you can see stunning  Aztec art. The Aztec capital Tenochtitlan was built on an island in the middle of a lake. The Mayan Cities are in the states of Yucatan and Chiapas. The pyramids of the sun and moon, which are featured in the movie Frida, are a short trip by taxi from Mexico City. The best beaches are on the Caribbean coast, which are close to the Mayan cities.",1363305600,3,1003,4.731428571428571
8406942,5,B003VOVW5O,"Professional travel video that features Guadalajara, the Puerto Vallarta area, Mexico City, and the pre-Aztec city site of Teotihuacan.  Wish it could have covered all of Mexico, but that would have taken up dozens of DVD's.",1299974400,,224,5.222222222222222
8406943,2,B003VOVW5O,Disappointing.  Rudy seemed to breeze in and out of Mexico without any thought to the vibrant culture and rich history.  Staying in a 5 star hotel with a spa is not my idea of an enriching Mexican vacation!,1296604800,5,206,4.394736842105263
