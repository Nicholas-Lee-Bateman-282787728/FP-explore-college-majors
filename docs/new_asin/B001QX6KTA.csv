3771477,3,B001QX6KTA,"Not quite what I was expecting. Very slow moving and kinda dull, in my opinion. Not as challenging as I was looking for, either.",1406678400,2,128,4.375
3771478,4,B001QX6KTA,The video is easy to follow and I like that it is broken out into two segments.  I don't do both of them on the same day and it really isn't necessary because the essentrics movements really get your whole body no matter which one you do.  The workouts are only 30 minutes but you definitely feel like you've worked out.,1405900800,14,320,4.229508196721311
3771479,3,B001QX6KTA,"I found this dvd to move a bit slowly overall, and although I think Essentrics is an interesting form of exercise, I still prefer Pilates. I didn't like the ""suck in your stomach"" that the teacher kept repeating. There was a lot of ""this exercise will burn the fat off your stomach."" That may work to motivate some people, but I prefer more positive imagery and teachers who push me to feel an exercise more fully, rather than focus on parts of myself that need fixing.",1400198400,7,469,4.465116279069767
3771480,5,B001QX6KTA,"I was pretty skeptical of this workout so waited about 8 months before really using it. I just started with this, or yoga or a pilates dvd, almost daily, for the last 2 weeks. I've done this one now 4 times and I am blown away at the results. I am literally leaner after each time I do it. Not only that I am breathing so much more deeply all the time, am standing taller, am much stronger, my shoulders aren't sore and ""creaky"" anymore (in only 2 WEEKS!) and I feel younger (I'm 49). This is really the best all around exercise I've ever done. Highly recommended if you want to stay lean, toned, youthful and happy!",1394755200,55,616,4.228813559322034

3771483,5,B001QX6KTA,"This is one of two Essentrics DVDs originally released by Sahra Esmonde-White, daughter of Miranda Esmonde-White, founder of the Classical Stretch DVDs.  Sahra is a Classical Stretch trainer herself and appears in many of her mother's workouts, but it is likely that the Essentrics line was deigned to appeal to younger viewers.

I am a Classical Stretch fan, but prior to trying this DVD, I had tried Sahra's other workout,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Essentrics-Sports-Flexibility-Workout-for-Athletes/dp/B001QX4PQU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Essentrics Sports: Flexibility Workout for Athletes</a>.  Although it wasn't a bad workout, I actually didn't like it much, mainly because it was cued via voicever (by Miranda), which had a much different feel than the casualness of the Classical Stretch workouts that I was used to and enjoyed.

I thought I might like this workout better, as Sahra cues live here.  She is featured in the same set as the other DVD (a large, almost industrial studio with large windows in the background), and she is joined by two female background exercisers, Ileana and Lawrence, who are also Essentrics trainers.

This DVD is broken up into two separate 30-minute workouts:  Workout 1: Arms, Abs & Waist Toner, and Workout 2: Legs, Butt, & Thighs Thinner.  The Main Menu of the DVD offers a brief (<1 minute) introduction to each workout, an option to ""Play All"" for each of the two workouts, and finally, a ""Scene Selection"" option which lets the viewer choose from Standing/Floorwork for the first workout and Standing/Floorwork/Barre Work for Workout 2.  I have broken down each workout in great detail below.

Workout 1: Arms, Abs & Waist Toner

Sahra begins this workout with a 3-minute warm-up which includes single arm circles (starting small and becoming larger) and then side-to-side lunges.  This is followed by a 6.5-minute standing flow section with shoulder blasts and more side-to-side lunges to work the waist and back.  The first arms series (3 minutes) follows, incorporating typical Classical Stretch movements for the arms and shoulders.  After this, Sahra performs another standing stretch segment (6 minutes), this time emphasizing windmills and washes.  She concludes the standing work with a second 3-minute arms series which focuses more on the triceps.

The final 8.5 minutes of this workout is on the floor.  First, there is approximately 6.5 minutes of abs work.  Sahra incorporates both crunches and more Pilates-like movements.  She then finishes with 2 minutes of stretches, including a stomach stretch (cobra pose) and side stretches in a seated position.

Workout 2: Legs, Butt, & Thighs Thinner

This workout begins with a 3-minute warm-up.  Here Sahra also incorporates single arm circles, but she also performs quite a few gentle kicks to loosen up the lower body, and she finishes with Figure 8s (aka hip cleaners) to loosen the hips.  This is followed by a 3-minute plie series.  Although these are Tai Chi plies (as in Classical Stretch), Sahra teaches them a bit differently.

That's it for the initial standing work--Sahra then moves to the floor for the floorwork series (14.5 minutes total).  She starts lying on one side for leg lifts; she targets both the outer and the inner thigh here.  She also works with the knees bent to more specifically focus on the butt.  The last 5 minutes of the floorwork is a seated stretch segment which includes twist, butterfly, seated forward bend, and thigh lengthening work.

For the last 9.5 minutes of this workout, Sahra and company use a chair for barre work.  At first, the chair is used only for balance, as Sahra performs several sets of rear pulses to target the butt (3 minutes).  Following this, however, she instructs stretches for the hips, psoas, and hamstring, placing one foot at a time on the barre.

To my surprise, I enjoyed the lower body portion more than the upper--I love the Classical Stretch arms work, so I expected to like Workout 1 better.  I did like that Workout 1 had two separate arms segments, but I felt that the standing sections dragged a bit.  However, these were great for stretching the back/waist (although I thought that the lower body workout was even more effective for stretching my low back, which has been bothering me of late).  Sahra is not quite as goofy as her mother, Miranda, although they do share the tendency to sometimes miscount repetitions from side-to-side.

In the end, I enjoyed this DVD, and I would recommend it; my final rating would be 4 1/2 stars.",1327104000,85,4571,5.154681139755767
3771484,5,B001QX6KTA,"I was pleasantly surprised when I did this workout about how good it really is. I workout a lot; practice and teach yoga, do club bells and kettlebells, and much more but I felt these moves in places not normally reached. If your looking for a good stretch that will lengthen and tone; this is the one.  Don't pay the high prices listed above; google essentrics workout and go directly to the source, $20 + S&H.  These come from Canada.",1275264000,83,436,4.4375
3771485,5,B001QX6KTA,"The title is a bit misleading since you can't spot-reduce. This isn't for burning lots of calories, it doesn't get the heart rate high enough. Having said that, with proper diet and extra cardio exercises, this will definitely help tone up problem areas. I'm trying to cut back on cardio due to spinal injury and needed something that will loosen up the joints and tone up without bulking up. These workouts are fairly basic but really concentrate on different muscle groups, hitting from different angles, and constantly stretching out the back by arching and rounding in fluid motion. They're easy to follow, no gimmicky or jerky movements here. The instructor does a good job at explaining without stopping or resting. I do both workouts at once (30 minutes each) and hardly get out of breath or break a sweat. But I feel it in my arms, legs, abs, and bums all day, and my posture has changed. It's a great way to start the day.

Also, the video is tastefully done- no annoying music, beautifully shot and art-directed.",1271376000,66,1022,4.741573033707865
3771486,4,B001QX6KTA,"eh, save your money and buy one of Miranda E White's season collection. Season 10 is pretty good. This is just more of that only with really poor production values.",1463356800,,164,4.5
3771487,5,B001QX6KTA,"A big fan of Miranda, but I loved these workouts.  If you are familiar with Classical Stretch, this is Miranda's daughter.  Excellent workout",1453680000,2,141,5.086956521739131

3771490,1,B001QX6KTA,"This video supposed to make more sense in fact as soon as the video starts to play ,she starts the workout without any warning, she move to next session next session with no warning. Not very comfortable, she needs to pause and talk what she's going to do that next. Not my favorite.",1444176000,5,283,4.3584905660377355
3771491,5,B001QX6KTA,"This is a really good workout. It takes about two attempts to get the hang of working out by 'pulling,' but stick with it. It is worth it and the results are great.",1443139200,,164,4.0

3771494,5,B001QX6KTA,"If you haven't seen her on your public TV station, you can't appreciate what great workouts these are. The emphasis on the extension - the stretching outward - of the muscles is opposite of most workouts. Great for stretching, flexabilitiy and balance. Expensive tapes  but if you buy the one where you get something like 30 workouts, definitely worth the money.",1438905600,5,362,4.934426229508197

3771499,4,B001QX6KTA,"I like this workout.  It's easy to follow, yet physically challenging.  The exercises seem to hit muscles not normally touched by other programs.  I can't really speak to how effective the exercises are since I just received the DVD, but I like the program enough to use it regularly, which is half the battle.",1434672000,,310,4.703703703703703
3771500,5,B001QX6KTA,"I am totally obsessing over doing the essentric workouts, they are seriously changing my muscles , and the calm manner in which she instructs is so nice , I can listen to her everday for an hour and not get sick of her , which Is saying a lot I think. this one is my newest acquisition and I love it, the only caution I would share is when she is doing the leg work and she wants you to stretch your knees with your hands in the pli position , I was not ready to be stretched that much, so a little soreness , I might not use my hands from now on and just stretch the best I can. other than that , I am so excited to workout now, its wonderful to actually see results in 3 weeks, though I do workout for an hour 5 days a week, and I do watch my diet very closely.  it will make you stronger , my whole core is getting tight and stronger, so is my back which is super good, and my frozen shoulder is just about healed up , and I know these essentric dvd's have been the answer. edited on oct 15 2016  i haven't used this workout for a long time and pulled it out 2 days ago the day after i did the workout my arms are sore, especially my triceps, and my whole abdomen is a little sore, also my lower back is feeling a little tight, i have been using essentrics only for 2 weeks and i have been using the total body , body sculpting and this one really is harder if you put out the effort of stretching your muscle's outward, as much as you can. i am only interested in the toning benefits mainly.",1433376000,18,1495,3.898360655737705

3771507,4,B001QX6KTA,"This isn't quite a 4 star workout for me, but it is more than a three. For background, I have done many different DVD workouts over the years and grow weary of them fairly quickly. I do Zumba and dance aerobics totaling three hours a week plus a 2 mile walk once a week. I am healthy and in good shape. But as I get older, (45)  I want to maintain my flexibility and strength. For me this DVD is challenging but dull.  I do not look forward to doing it and talk myself into it twice a week. To me it feels like a grind to get through but it does compliment my Zumba and dance workouts. My legs have grown stronger and my hips feel great, not tight or achy at all. Also the range of motion in my shoulders has really improved and my core strength has increased. So although I don't have ANY fun doing this, it is beneficial. I don't believe you can spot thin like Sahra keeps saying, but you can strengthen and tone with this workout. In conjunction with aerobic activities I believe this workout could really get you looking your best.",1426118400,18,1035,4.1959798994974875

3771510,3,B001QX6KTA,"I was disappointed that it was Sahra on the DVD and not Miranda as I had understood it would be.  The quality of the DVD picture is somewhat blurry. There is also a point in the workout that it sounds like someone is talking in the background. Sometimes it is hard to see what Sahra is doing, because of the angle of the camera. By the time you figure it out she is done and on to the next move. This is very frustrating.",1423612800,8,421,4.011904761904762

Miranda's programs are televised in the wee early morning hours where I live and I sometimes sleep through them if I've been staying up late because of back pain.  I can honestly state that after only a week of upper body stretching with this program, I can breathe easier as the stretches have loosened back adhesions that have been in my body since 2011.  Miranda says some followers have even experienced an addition to their height that has been shortened by many back surgeries.  I am fused from T-7 through S-1, and I can feel the difference already.  My pain level is now manageable without narcotics and this is after 6 years of aqua PT to no avail.  I have recommended it to all my former Physical Therapists for their review and possible use with their patients.  It is keeping me in better spirits to feel better and I highly recommend any of her programs.  My rotator cuff pain has been reduced with this series.",1503273600,3,1006,4.519337016574585

This program will strengthen, tone and lengthen every muscle in your body, while increasing joint mobility/range of motion and flexibility. You really work every muscle and joint in your body. When done, I feel worked out, but not in any pain, in fact, I feel great when done. These are not fast paced, intense cardio workouts, but yet, I am sweating when done. You get out of it what you put in. I have been doing this program consistently for the last 8 months, while eating clean and have toned up my entire body, lost weight, slimmed my waist and strengthened my entire core, ( age 53 and in decent shape to begin with). I have purchased many of the dvd's directly from their website. This is a program suitable for any age. For the older folks, I recommend starting with Miranda's "" Classical Stretch"" series, as it is shorter in duration, and a bit gentler. I highly recommend.",1471478400,,1038,4.5212765957446805
