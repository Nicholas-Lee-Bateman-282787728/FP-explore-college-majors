1920762,2,B0000D1FGV,"Seven Doors to Death, 1945 film

The movie begins on a city street. We hear a gunshot and a woman scream. A man falls to the floor. A woman runs from the building, and uses a pistol to hijack a car. When the driver regains consciousness the woman is gone. Jimmy McMillan returns to that ""Hamilton Shop"" and finds a body. Police Captain Jaffe gets a report from a policeman. Miss Mary Rawlins is brought in for identification and questioning. She has her aunt Maude's deed. Horace Dorn, the lawyer, is dead. Jimmy follows Mary back to her shop. We hear what Mary saw. Jimmy checks out the other shops. Captain Jaffe found out who the man in the checked suit was. One of the shop owners must be the murderer! Jimmy and Mary search the dark cellar. They find an Egyptian chest with a body in it. ""Don't move!"" says a man with a gun. Will Claude tell the police? Photographer Henry has pictures and a darkroom in his cellar.

The police are watching Mary, under suspicion. Jimmy visits another shop. That ""moderately priced"" fur coat is $3,000! One man searches for the jewelry. Next there are shots inside. A man runs out and falls to the ground. Who did it? Captain Jaffe questions each shop owner separately. Later a woman dances to phonograph music. Jimmy and Mary follow the photographer into the dark cellar. There is a scream in the night. Jimmy is struck by a club. He visits Mary, who tells what happened to her. They find a package with the aunt's jewelry and a marriage certificate. Someone else would be the co-heir. Jimmy thinks he has solved the murder now. The police arrive and take Mary in as a suspect. Jimmy finds the rest of the jewelry hidden in a store. Can he find the real killer? There is a fight in a store. Captain Jaffe returns. Jimmy explains who the killer is, and how he made fingerprints to blame a dead man.

There will be a happy ending for Mary and Jimmy, who also gets $45 to repair the damage to his car. This is an interesting story that is almost average for a mystery story. It tells about life and culture as seen by Hollywood. Its importance is the description of forging fingerprints.",1316736000,,2123,4.4524421593830334
1920763,4,B0000D1FGV,"This is an average Alpha disc.  The film is relatively splice-free, but the night scenes are too dark.  The original Monogram titles are intact.",1260057600,2,144,4.958333333333333
1920764,1,B0000D1FGV,"This movie actually put the fish in my aquarium to sleep! It has no plot, point, or reason to be for sale. Trust me save you 5 bucks!",1067212800,6,133,3.7857142857142856
1920785,3,B0000D1FGV,"I had this edition before the Grindhouse one. It isn't the Seven Doors domestic release with an alternate score, trimmed out gore and a few spliced in unrelated pickup shots, though that would be an interesting curiousity in widescreen. This is a PAL conversion in very high quality I suppose, because it is fractionally time shifted. A new title card insert reads 7 doos but isn't the title sequence from 7 doors prints, the splatter and the music are intact and the overall picture is slightly sped up, hence the shorter running time. The sound, bonus options, proper color correction and overall packaging make the Grindhouse edition FAR better and more an essential to possess in any edition. I haven't seen the Slingshot release mentioned by another reviewer as converted to field sequential, so i do not know if that is the true 7 doors edit or not. Because I saw the 7 doors version first in my youth I have a sentimental fondness for its alternate score and weird hack jub cutting, but of course much prefer the Maestro's true cut. That said if you appreciate these films get the Grindhouse edition period. If you have fond memories of the first domestic run or are a curiosity seeker, find a 7 doors version second as a sort of extra supplement. But be aware, this diamond edition is not that version at all.",1459814400,,1317,4.656652360515022

1920789,1,B0000D1FGV,Obviously a Stage production at one time.  An authentic look at British shops back in the 30's.,1455580800,,95,4.588235294117647

1920792,3,B0000D1FGV,"This is for the Slingshot edition.  Since this is the US edit of ""The Beyond"", it should be avoided.  It is widescreen, dubbed, and runs 83 minutes(should be 87).  There is a 2D and 3D version on the disc.  It wasn't shot in 3D, so why make a fake 3D version of it.  There are so many much better editions now available under the Beyond title.  Get one of those.",1453766400,,362,4.1
1920793,2,B0000D1FGV,Simplistic plot that had pretensions of being a whodunit. Probably a great way to kill an afternoon at the Bijou 70+ years ago.,1446940800,,127,4.565217391304348
1920794,3,B0000D1FGV,"Also known as Vanishing Corpses, which is odd because only one body goes missing.  The movie begins with a bang, literally, followed by screams and a quick getaway.  Someone has been shot!!!  When a dubious bystander (Chick Chandler as Jimmy McMillan) reports the murder to the police, they are more than a little puzzled when the body shows up in a different room wearing a different suit.  Naturally, the bystander gets involved in solving the case, especially as a femme fatale (June Clyde as Mary Rawling) is somehow mixed up in the crime.  A large quantity of jewelry is also at stake.  There are many suspects all with businesses that converge on the same cellar where the first body is hidden.  The police take their time poking around; its up to the amateurs to solve the case.

A serviceable mystery that benefits from having pleasant lead actors.  But the transfer is incredibly bad.  The sound is intermittent throughout.  It comes and goes abruptly, sizzling to dead quiet.  The tonal quality of the images is also spectacularly dismal.  Both make for a frustrating viewing experience.  It was okay to watch once, but I wouldnt want to sit through it again under these conditions.",1446854400,,1192,4.836633663366337

1920817,1,B0000D1FGV,"A hotel in Louisiana is built upon one of the seven gates of hell. It was walled up in 1927 and was real;eased later in 1981. This was supposed to be satanic, but the zombie like walking dead would classify this as a zombie film. I was rather bored with the film. The restoration was excellent, which allowed us to know how horribly dubbed it was. Not worth a rental.",1437955200,,367,4.257142857142857

1920820,3,B0000D1FGV,"This film has some of the most craziest death scenes I've ever seen... besides his earlier effort, Gates of Hell.",1396656000,,113,4.7
1920821,2,B0000D1FGV,Film would be OK but the transfer is really horrible.  Many scenes are so dark you can't make out what's happening.,1385769600,,115,4.476190476190476
1920822,1,B0000D1FGV,"Not only is it an awful movie - the quality of picture and audio are awful as well. The original audio is terrible, yet it's made worse by some idiot who hasn't even bothered with noise reduction techniques (which by itself creates inferior sound) - whole chunks of audio are simply ripped out leaving total silence. I think people prefer to hear the whirring, hiss... etc,. in old films rather than a shoddy, mangled attempt at 'cleanup'.

There's something rather enjoyable about watching B-movies with their cheap sets and bad acting, but not when the quality of the print is extremely poor.  Alpha Video has got a verve putting this out as a standalone DVD - should be given away as a freebee, or included in one of those 50-films packages. I watched it to the end (I'm very determined) in all its dreary basement greyness, then put it in the bin.",1379203200,4,851,4.592105263157895

1920824,3,B0000D1FGV,"is the appropriate title, however it should be noted more as a play rather than a movie the main locale appears to be a modeled store front, with behind the scenes activity that adds an air of mystery to the ""who done it ?"" theme.",1367280000,,230,4.133333333333334
7999964,4,B0000D1FGV,"Ok, So clearly this was a filmed saved before it turned to dust.
Parts of this are very dark & hard to see but the script is more than likely long gone.
Yes the story needs to be punched up but any number of detective shows has already done that.
But a remake of the seven doors I don't think I've seen.
But I am sure there are some garden apt's some where that resemble that set.",1496188800,,380,3.948051948051948

7999967,1,B0000D1FGV,"I'm afraid I can't really recommend this one. The story is bad, the leads are worse, and big chunks of it are so poorly lit that you can't even tell that much. Amazon has far better 60 minute B noirs available. Please watch Cry Danger or Shadow of Suspicion instead.",1479168000,,266,4.34
