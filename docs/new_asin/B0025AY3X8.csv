3848066,3,B0025AY3X8,"If you already own ""Spectacular Spider-Man: Attack of the Lizard,"" you can probably skip this - it's the same thing, only divided into three episodes of the TV series, while ""Attack"" had the same three episodes edited into a movie.  If you don't own ""Attack"" or if you want your ""Spectacular Spider-Man"" collection to be intact as originally aired, this is worth getting.",1241654400,12,371,4.888888888888889

3848083,5,B0025AY3X8,These DVD's are good to show to children who are too young to view the Spiderman Movie in the theatre because the movie is PG-13. These DVD's have three episodes in each and are age appropriate for school age 6-10 year olds to watch.,1402617600,4,233,4.318181818181818

3848091,5,B0025AY3X8,Producers should watch and take note.  These are great cartoons.  This is just what my grandsons want to watch.  Shame you have to hunt for1960s cartoons in order to get good ones.  Recommend to everyone.,1343347200,11,204,4.742857142857143
3848092,5,B0025AY3X8,"I was very impressed with the background and the subtle humor from the background that went along with the banter of the fights and obvious humor (small spoiler - ex: Doc Ock defeated on the octopus ride, very well played). All the stories were well written for adults! 6 stars! The only main problem I have is the childish large eyes that distract and belittle the character of the show itself. 2 stars! Also Spider-man is drawn a bit out of proportion many times. Why? 3 stars! This goes for all 8 Volumes. Then we have 3 or 4 episodes per Vol. and Paying $95 for 26 episodes is uncalled for. No stars, just a blackhole.",1332979200,,622,4.370689655172414

3848094,5,B0025AY3X8,"Decently done, with some good humor here and there for the adults.  Captures the original spirit of the comic fairly well, in a condensed package, of course.  No blood, no gore, only comic-style violence, no bad language.  Fine for ages three/four and up in my opinion.",1304467200,35,269,4.804347826086956
3848095,5,B0025AY3X8,"My son absolutely loves Spider-Man.  He has all the Spider-Man DVDs plus more!  He saw the series Spectacular Spider-Man on Foxtel and as it has not been released on DVD in Australia, I did a search via Google.  When I placed the order with Amazon, my son counted down the days until it was delivered.  He now has volumes 1, 2, 3 and 4 of the series and is eagerly awaiting the release of the next volume.  I certainly get my monies worth of these DVDs !!!!  I am one very happy and very grateful mum ......  Thanks Amazon :-)",1243123200,5,526,4.2
