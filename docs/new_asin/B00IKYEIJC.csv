8643224,4,B00IKYEIJC,"Set in Liverpool we meet Kelly (Antonia Campbell-Hughes - `Lead Balloon' TV series) who at first glance looks like butter wouldn't melt in her mouth. She has a bit of a sexual proclivity that takes her outside what some would consider the normal social mores of coital intercourse. She is into asphyxiation.  Whilst at a nightclub she meets Victor (Julian Morris - `Valkyrie' to name but one credit). They seem to have an immediate rapport and end up `getting it on'.

Well after the taboo of her `need'is out, it seems to grow and their sexploits seem to add more meaning to their lives which, aside from the odd gig with a dominatrix for Kelly, do seem to be a bit mundane. Victor though sees things going too far - the question is where will such dangerously charged sexual needs end?

To say anymore would be a plot spoiler and there is so much more to this film. It is a bit layered and some would argue subtle to the point of obscuring the real message - if indeed there is a tangible one. I felt that it was all about love, lust, real emotions and sexual needs. It plays out like a damaged poem with some of the scenes taking on the surreal to the grotesque - though not literally. Some commentators have berated the film for doing exactly what I feel it sets out to do. That being it is not meant to be a damning indictment on sexually driven desires or as a lesson to `beware', but a story albeit a very moving one about two people who try to connect on a very deep and emotional level.

Not for the easily offended or sexually squeamish, although that side is not graphic, it was never meant to be. If you like you films to push boundaries then this will probably one you would want to see.",1396569600,,1700,4.3197492163009406
