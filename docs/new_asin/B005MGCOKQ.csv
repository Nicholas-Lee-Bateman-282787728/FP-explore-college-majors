This movie shows bald and naked the truth of our community and what we suffer of. This is the best movie I've seen so far and I can really connect with the protagonist. I'm a minor myself and this movie shows the struggels of youth and our thoughts and so help me it is right and I can understand every action of Dominik! This society is broken and you can't fix it. Leave it to us, helping each other and try getting the message of this movie. We are different and we don't want to be normal! We are proud of what we are and we respect others who are as well. That is the message the film brings and for that this movie deserves to be seen!",1383350400,,766,4.079470198675497

8479369,2,B005MGCOKQ,"This is a very slickly produced, very pretentious, heavy-handed and plodding movie that presumes to be about teen suicide... or something - I'm really not sure what it was supposed to be. Maybe you have to be heavily into video games and Japanese cartoons - or a suicidal teenager - to appreciate it. All the technological glitz to me was just a huge, actually an insurmountable distraction. I tried to pick out what was happening to Dominik through all that crap, but it was hard work.

Evidently he was a rich, spoiled, whiny, self-centered baby in a man's body, throwing fits in public whenever he felt put upon. That's what most of us are like at that age: some get over it and grow up, some get older but never grow up, and evidently some go off into a weird techno-nightmare and either stay there or kill themselves.

The movie has a note at the beginning giving a hotline number for suicidal teens to call - if this movie brings comfort to any suffering kids, thank God for it; but as a movie, as entertainment, it's a plodding, heavy, glitzy, pretentious failure.",1349308800,,1071,4.572916666666667

8479371,3,B005MGCOKQ,"This review is about the movie, rather than this particular format, as I have not watched it in this format.
This is certainly a watch because of the way it creatively juxtaposes reality with an online fantasy world. The juxtaposition suggests that perhaps the people living ""normal"" lives, like the parents, are also crafting sort of fantasy worlds for themselves in order to survive in the real world...even if their fantasies are affairs and not the online world. The theme of people crafting fantasies to enable them to suffer through life has been explored before, but not in a visually striking, heartwrenching way like this. This is a darker, edgier American Beauty for a new generation, in a way.
That being said, the film lacks in certain ways. It explored the above-mentioned theme, but didn't offer an alternative to futility, something that would have been a refreshing change from the dark notes of this film and films similar to it. I also felt that this wasn't really a ""gay and lesbian"" film. While the film does challenge sexual preference norms and gender norms to a degree and played with the idea of struggling with one's sexuality, it still felt very heteronormative, which made me uncomfortable and distracted me from an otherwise decent film.
All that being said, if the ideas presented here don't bother you, it's worth a watch and will at least be food for thought.",1331596800,,1390,4.8691983122362865

8479373,5,B005MGCOKQ,"Dominik has it all: a wealthy family, good looks, intelligence and a bright and promising future ahead of him. But why does he feel like he's losing his grip on all of it? Popularity seems to elude him, and although a few girls still want to dance with him in parties, he's slowly succumbing to shyness, struggling against minor aggressions from other students, against the seemingly harmless mockery of his peers. Jan Komasa's film establishes these premises from the very beginning: we see Dominik in the opera with his rich parents, and in high school, in parallel sequences that will become of paramount importance for the structure of ""Sala samobjcw"".

Adolescence is always difficult, hormonal changes and new feelings can destabilize anyone. Dominik finds himself exscinded, adrift between two possibilities: What does it mean to be manly? And what does it entail to act effeminately? Gender roles are not unwavering, as they change and evolve through times, through the actions of the people. Gendered behaviors are unnatural: the way in which we learn the performance of gender roles (what we commonly associate with femininity and masculinity) is an act of sorts, a performance, one that is imposed upon us by normative heterosexuality. We are like actors in a stage, trying to persuade others that we are either men or women: we do not follow our natural tendencies but rather the dictates of society.

Everything in Dominik's life pertains to the norm; even his parents are ruled by it: they are like slaves following the orders of the marketing industry, in the case of the mother, and the government, in the case of the father. Yes, they have made a fortune, but in order to do so they have obeyed norms for so long that they can no longer feel free. It's this slavery that forces them to assume the heterosexual normativity to the extreme and have sex with anonymous lovers, in other words, they need a member of the opposite sex to enforce their roles as productive and successful heterosexual individuals.

And that's what's expected of their son. And that's why he cannot reconcile his existential doubts with the demands of adulthood. In her book about Performativity, theorist Judith Butler (in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undoing-Gender/dp/0415969239/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undoing Gender</a>) asks herself to what extent our acts are determined for us, rather by our place within language and convention. For Butler, identity is an illusion retroactively created by our performances. She defines identity as ""a compelling illusion, an object of belief"" (not unlike Dominik's interpretation of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hamlet/dp/1613820917/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hamlet</a>). Perhaps in past decades this was harder to understand, but now let's think about the internet and online communities in which we can recreate and reinvent ourselves. That's what Dominik finds in the ""Suicide Room"", a virtual environment, a rendezvous point for a group of strangers that rely on `avatars' and online interaction.

Although slightly insecure, Dominik is first presented as a `normal' boy. Nevertheless, everything changes after a party in which two girls kiss each other and then challenge him to do the same with his friend Aleksander. Why do the girls kiss? Certainly they are not lesbians but they are unwillingly subverting the very foundations of heterosexual normativity. In the same way, the two boys kiss each other and personify for a few seconds the abject, in other words, the homosexual condition, ""a domain of unthinkable, abject, unlivable bodies"". In order to have a heterosexual normativity there must be something that opposes to it. This repudiation is necessary for the subject to establish an identification with the normative phantasm of sex.

At the beginning, it would seem like this innocent kiss doesn't disturb anyone. Dominik's friends even upload the kiss on YouTube but there are no hard reactions, no negative consequences. It's like a simple, childish joke. That is, until Dominik is wrestling with Aleksander during their judo lessons. Aleksander holds him down, and rubs his body against Dominik, this becomes so arousing for the teenager that he can't help but to ejaculate right there. Aleksander starts laughing about it and Dominik leaves the room instantly, completely humiliated and embarrassed.

Aleksander, maliciously, tells everyone about the ""semen incident"" on Facebook, and the entire school starts laughing at Dominik. The boy is now under a lot of pressure and he cannot cope with it. That's when he finds a safe haven in the ""Suicide Room"". Let's remember that gender, according to Butler, is by no means tied to material bodily facts but is solely and completely a social construction, a fiction, one that, therefore, is open to change and contestation. In a way, this suicidal group is defying every convention; not only are they attempting to end their lives, but they are also computer generated images that have created an entire world online. Butler argues that sex (male, female) is seen to cause gender (masculine, feminine) which, in turn, is seen to cause desire (towards the other gender). This is commonly regarded as a kind of continuum. Butler's approach - inspired in part by Michel Foucault - is basically to smash the alleged connection between them, so that gender and desire are flexible, free-floating and not 'caused' by the same recurrent factors. This idea of identity as free-floating, as not attached to an 'essence', but instead to a performance, is one of the key ideas in queer theory. And it's also fundamental in order to comprehend Jan Komasa's remarkable film. In the ""Suicide Room"" there is a Queen, mythical creatures and warriors, and soon Dominik becomes a member of this unkempt club. Everyone here has, indeed, a floating, virtual identity. And gender rules don't really apply, as the Queen and Dominik have an intense friendship that can never turn into physical love.

Just as it happened in the opening frames of the film, there are two parallel sequences: the ones in the real world, and the ones in this non-existent place created thanks to the internet. When Dominik tells his parents that he might be gay, they adamantly refuse to give credit to such possibility. As it has been established, they're so deeply embroiled in the heterosexual normativity that no other alternative can be valid for them. But since the body becomes its gender only ""through a series of acts which are renewed, revised, and consolidated through time"", the acts of Dominik are soon labeled as confusing and weird. By illustrating the artificial, conventional, and historical nature of gender construction, Butler critiques the assumptions of normative heterosexuality: those punitive rules (social, familial, and legal) that force us to conform to hegemonic, heterosexual standards for identity. It is necessary to distrust the definition of gender, weakening the status quo in order to fight for the rights of marginalized identities (gays and lesbians).

Unable to ascribe to predetermined gender roles, Dominik is now a tortured and fragile soul, vulnerable to the influence of this mysterious girl that acts like the Queen of the Suicide Room. But she along with her subjects are no more than phantasmatic projections devoid of any `realness' or any sexual attributes for that matter. None of this matters to Dominik, who becomes more and more invested in this virtual world, neglecting reality and becoming completely isolated. Jan Komasa cites, with subtlety, the heterosexual normativity and creates a deep, fascinating, dark and yet completely human story that will leave viewers in awe. A true masterpiece from Poland.",1320796800,8,7815,5.332522303325223
