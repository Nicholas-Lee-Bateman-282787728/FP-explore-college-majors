Her make-up along with the pig mask looked good and real- life like. Her eyes were the most frighening thing about her, if you pay attention in the movie there are some scenes when you look right into the eyes it was absolutely frightening, especially her acting. I love this movie mostly cuz its low-budget picture and the sounds are rather unique to me, not just pig girl's voice but as you get into the movie you hear weird sounds that are added. I'm real glad that i was able to see this finally...and better yet i was able to own it!! ""what will they think of next when they make another monster movie""",1460246400,,721,4.1571428571428575

8660997,5,B00KRHH6Y4,"Didn't expect much from this one, but from the cinematography to the vastly improved sound, ""Pig Girl"" might actually be better than the Porkchop movies it follows. Didn't expect the LONGEST POST-CREDIT SEQUENCE in movie history, that's for sure. Don't turn it off at the credits, there's like another 20 minutes. That's crazy. These people are insane and I can't wait to see what they do next. Highly recommended.",1423094400,,414,5.0144927536231885

8660999,5,B00KRHH6Y4,"Excellent independent movie. Bought it along with pork chop 1,2,3!  Missy dawn is freaky with all the oinking and squealing. Eamon Hardiman did a great job and I hope there will be a part two.",1408406400,,192,4.485714285714286
