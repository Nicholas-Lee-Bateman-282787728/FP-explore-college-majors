8678472,3,B0040ZJCKK,"Overall you will enjoy this look at the longstanding rivalry (dubbed the Superclsico) between the two most popular soccer teams in Argentina--Boca Juniors and River Plate. Although the focus is on these two sides, the movie does touch on other rivalries in the Argentinian League and how club sides always come first in most supporters' opinions over the national team.

To start with, though, the title and artwork/packaging of this DVD is terrible. If you read the title you'd have no clue it was about River vs. Boca. Was it impossible not to take a still from the movie of the crowd going crazy at a match? Or even some goalmouth action scene for a DVD that, although it is trying to tell us a lot about Argentinian society, it is also mainly about soccer.

There are ZERO extras on the DVD. Can you believe that? Why not have a short history of each club, some player profiles, some of their greatest moments, goals or saves. Basically any DVD about soccer better have more soccer on the pitch than off it. This is where the movie gets it all wrong--too many talking heads segments. It's also fails in the section on hooliganism by showing some scene from some Argentinian movie. Why not show numerous ""actual"" hooliganism that is readily available on YouTube and give it some context, social critique or whatnot?

All in all, if you have no clue about Argentinian League soccer it's a decent jumping off point but how is this rivalry truly any different than Flamengo-Fluminense in Brazil, Real Madrid-Barcelona in Spain or Celtic-Rangers in Scotland? Sure the details are slightly different and we get Boca Jrs. represent the poor (although how a multimillion peso enterprise represents the working class is surely worth commenting on in the movie) and River Plate nicknamed Los Millonarios ages ago represent the ""rich.""

What I really wanted was to hear more from the greats on this rivalry. We do get a fairly lengthy look at what Diego Maradona means to Boca fans (yes, he is treated as a god) but I wanted to learn about the more humble heroes of the River fans such as Enzo Francescoli and Daniel Passarella. We do get to hear from Martin Palermo of Boca fame and some young up-and-coming babyfaced star Diego Buonanotte (who after this movie was filmed was involved in a horrific car crash that left three of his passengers dead and although Buonanotte survived he had a long road to recovery) on River but the movie just seems to never take it to the next level.

It's watchable but for soccer fans who know already about either the Argentinian League or rivalries, you'll be more interested in seeing the crowds in the few in-stadium shots than a bunch of old men arguing in a restaurant.

As a DVD, though, how about if there's a followup Blu-Ray version that you throw some of us soccer fans a bone with a slew of extras that would make it worth buying the DVD again.",1323907200,,2885,4.658153241650295

Muestra diferentes puntos de vista; desde un sociologo, un jugador de Boca, otro del River, un locutor de futbol, un entrenador de un club social, en fin, varios personajes que muestran como la cultura del futbol es una pasion con muchos origenes y explicaciones que me hicieron querer este deporte aunque sea un poco.

Si no sabes que regalarle a tu hombre... este es un infalible, vas a quedar muy bien y vas a divertirte a la vez, con el y con sus amigos, con choripan o pizza y cerveza.",1292544000,,574,4.40566037735849

Dinmico y emotivo. Con una cantidad de personajes entraables que parecen extrados de un relato de ficcin sobre un pas tan involucrado con el ftbol que a veces la vida tanto fsica como social depende del resultado del partido domingo.

Muy Recomendada!!!!!!",1292544000,2,420,5.072463768115942
