8581890,5,B00CHV7MSS,"This book's main focus is stances, something I've needed to incorporate in my practice.  The colors are black, white and grey and the instructions consist mostly of one or two words.  I find this to be an incredibly soothing and calming DVD that also gives a powerful workout.  I've never seen a qigong CD like this, and it's a gem.
