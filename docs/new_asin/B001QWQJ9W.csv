3771404,5,B001QWQJ9W,This movie is so cool that I watched it every week. I like how they made shaymin talk. I recommend this movie.,1242864000,,110,4.045454545454546
3771405,5,B001QWQJ9W,"My daughter loves this movie.  As she says ""It is a must have for any Pokemon fan.""",1241654400,,83,3.8823529411764706
3771406,5,B001QWQJ9W,My 6 year old loves this movie. He was very excited to see that alot of new characters were included in the movie.,1240531200,2,114,4.0
3771407,4,B001QWQJ9W,"My first impression of this movie is that its not entirely sure what age group its trying to appeal to. Here we have a storyline with some potentially deep (and confusing to young viewers) concepts -like in the 4th movie- that aren't really fleshed out too much. There's the obligatory Ash and co involvement alongside legendary and rare Pokemon features, though most content is overshadowed somewhat by a heavy focus on Shaymin.

Giratina takes something of a back seat to this little grass type shapeshifter, despite its name being at the head of the movie title. Regigigas feels like its been tagged on as an afterthought. On top of that, Brock gets to experience Team Rocket's place in pretty much every movie up to now - sidelined in favour of shining the spotlight on Ash and Dawn. Amusingly enough, reference to this is actually made in the movie dialogue of both the original and the dub.

I'm not entirely sure why Ash was so sad to see Shaymin leave after the hard time it gave him...

Newton and Zero are both fascinating cameos, with the former winning out on eccentricity and the latter winning out on technology - who knows where he got that massive aircraft/scientific device from, but in the end, who cares?

The main winner in this production has to be the artwork which, with every movie, has done nothing but improve in clarity, beauty and the blending of 3D and 2D. In Sky Warrior, the backgrounds and special effects are truly breathtaking. One minor letdown here is the cel-shaded Pokemon stick out a little from everything else, but its not a blatant eyesore.

Though not as stirring as previous installments, the soundtrack was a reasonable feature - taking inspiration from Rise of Darkrai to keep a continuity throughout the 10th, 11th and 12th movies.

While we need to expect the ending of Sky Warrior to have a bit of an unfinished feel to it -being part of a trilogy- the entire plot seemed to have the same feel, and that's rather a shame. Characters you're meant to foster emotions for don't end up developed enough for that reaction to occur. A similar problem happened in Rise of Darkrai, and it doesn't seem to have yet been rectified.

All in all, its a valid addition to the Pokemon movie series, and an enjoyable watch. However, it remains to be seen whether the DVD shall feature any extras that make it an appealing buy.",1235433600,,2360,4.672289156626506
3771408,2,B001QWQJ9W,"Wow, was this movie confusing.  I realize it's a big commercial for the new Pokemon Platinum game coming out next month, but there were some big weirdnesses in it.  As usual, there is a new character having an adventure and Ash horns in on it and takes all the action, glory and credit.  Never was this more painfully obvious than in ""Pokemon 4Ever,"" where a boy named Sam has a time-traveling adventure with Celebi, but as soon as he comes to Ash's time, Ash starts hogging the whole show.  But in ""Giratina"" it is almost as bad.

The middle of the movie is pretty much standard fare, with the telepathically-speaking Shaymin (an annoying little whiner) providing sappy commentary.  The players move in and out of the Distortion World, and although this appears to be a frightening alternate world, they (of course) all travel through it with aplomb.

(As a side note I notice that the main Pokemon in the last 4 movies have all been able to speak telepathically - Shaymin, Darkrai, Manaphy and Lucario.  I wonder whether this is just a tactic for the movies, being done because kids are bored hearing Pokemon only speak their own names, or is it a new feature of the Pokemon canon that may be released in a new game, i.e., Professor Oak (or whoever) will have invented something that lets us ""hear"" Poke-speech?  But I digress.)

Later, when the baddie is trying to destroy Giratina, all of a sudden a Regigigas wakes up from some kind of enchanted sleep and walks out to where the main characters are (except Ash, who is off being heroic with Pikachu in the Distortion World).  As Regigigas appears to try and hold back a moving waterfall that threatens to freeze the entire area, hordes of Mamoswine appear and assist Regigigas.  Nobody says anything at this point except Dawn, who says, ""Look at all the Mamoswine!""  They stand there watching the Regigigas and Mamoswine trying to hold the frozen glacier-thing in place, and then, when the disaster has been averted, Regigigas and the Mamoswine simply walk away.  No explanation is provided for why Regigigas woke from his strange temple and tried to hold back the glacier, or why the Mamoswine felt compelled to help it; no explanation is given as to why they all walked away (or where they went) after the disaster was dealt with.  Truly a cheap deus ex machina tactic.

For those of you Team Rocket fans, you may be wondering what their role is in all this.  As far as I can tell, early on, they got sucked into the Distortion World.  Periodically while Ash and Co. were monkeying around in there, we'd see Team Rocket in trouble.  Towards the end, we see them trying to escape the Distortion World and failing.  I don't even remember if the Team Rocket situation was resolved.  Other than Meowth cracking a few jokes, and a lot of footage of them screaming in fear in the Distortion World, there was not really any Team Rocket to speak of.

The animation in Pokemon movies seems to be getting better over time, especially with non-moving things like buildings.  I might almost say that the buildings in the movie are on a par with Studio Ghibli stuff.  But the landscaping and the characters are still drawn in the very cheap way that the early Pokemon TV shows were done.

All in all I was quite disappointed - even my 8YO son found some of this to be bizarre - and we probably won't get the DVD.",1235347200,,3356,4.590604026845638
3771409,4,B001QWQJ9W,"Note: This review is based off of seeing the movie on TV, when it was shown on Cartoon Network. As such, I can't comment on DVD features, only the movie itself.

The latest Pokemon movie continues a trend of steady improvement that the Pokemon movies have been showing for the past four or five. This movie, the eleventh, chronicles Ash, Dawn, and Brock's adventures with the legendary Pokemon Shaymin.

The story covers the existence of a Reverse World where the legendary Pokemon Giratina lives, and its connections to the real world. The villain seeks to exploit Giratina and those connections, theoretically for noble purposes; realistically out of sheer madness. The heroes and Shaymin get caught up in the mayhem. The story is not on its surface incredibly complicated, which is a plus considering the intended audience, but there are also some wider themes present if one is looking for them.

Visually, it's mostly standard anime fare; however, there are plenty of scenes that are quite impressive, especially the attacks of the Pokemon, the portals to and from the Reverse World, and one of the villain's weapons later on in the movie.

However, the movie started to feel like the Shaymin Channel after a while. If anyone wants to know what moves Shaymin can use and the details and limitations of Shaymin's Sky Form, all you have to do is watch the movie. I found it to be somewhat irritating after a while, simply because I would have preferred that they spend the time on the story or its characters rather than put so much of a focus on Shaymin, although that's merely a personal preference.

In summary, it's a fine movie, and certainly worth watching. It's not perfect, what with the over-focus on Shaymin. But it's easily deserving of four stars, and I think it to be an interesting movie for anyone, fans of Pokemon or not.",1235347200,16,1840,4.791798107255521
3771410,5,B001QWQJ9W,I'm a 41 year old anime fan and I loved this movie.  I have watched it 3 times with my 12 year old son already and we both really loved it.

3771413,5,B001QWQJ9W,It's a good movie if you like Pokemon. I'm an adult and have loved Pokemon since I was young. It was nice to watch this with my son. It's also a very good price.,1393718400,,161,3.764705882352941

I haven't seen them all yet, and I didn't see this one before buying it, and I totally recommend it. One of the better Pokemon movies out there!",1393200000,,276,4.226415094339623

3771418,5,B001QWQJ9W,This Pokemon movie is kick ass but the producers and animators has done too many movies too quickly but I don't have a problem with it.,1370995200,,135,4.230769230769231
3771419,5,B001QWQJ9W,"This is the fifth Pokmon movie I own. This one is actually part of a three movie story arc featuring the legendary Pokmon of Sinnoh Dailgia, Palkia, and Arceus. This is by far the best of the three and the best of the Sinnoh story trilogy. The bossy Shaymin kind of steals the show, but really is funny with its bossy and puffed-up attitude which softens near the end of the movie. Highly recommend this to any Pokmon fan.",1369526400,,422,4.3544303797468356
3771420,4,B001QWQJ9W,Anyone who loves Pokemon would probably really enjoy this movie. I'm not talking about just Pokemon game lovers though; but for the Anime version. Of course! I love to buy the Pokemon movies at least xD because the anime has too many seasons for me to want to buy lol.,1363737600,,268,4.38
3771421,5,B001QWQJ9W,"For those of you who love Pokemon this is a great movie. It has fun pokemon and a bittersweet story like most pokemon movies. This movie involves another Legendary Pokemon named Shaymin who is drawn into a battle with Dialga and Giratina and drags them into the reverse world. The event is seen by Zero the antagonist. Shaymin portals back to the normal world and runs into Ash Kechum and friends. Shaymin is a little pompous and pisses me off in the beginning but like most Pokemon movies he learns a live lesson that teaches him humility. Team Rocket tries to steal Shaymin only to have a portal to the Reverse World open and Ash and company as well as Team Rocket all get thrust in. Now they have to find their way back to the normal world after defeating Giratina and Zero who absorbed him while getting thrust back and forth multiple times through the portal between the Reverse World and the Normal World.

If you love Pokemon movies you'll love this one. Like all Pokemon movies it is a bittersweet story that teaches life lessons as it goes. It's got new fun and fascinating Pokemon, old friends are back like Ash, Brock, and Team Rocket. It makes you cry in some places and laugh in others. It is truly a journey of learning about ones self and what makes a person (or pokemon) courageous.",1362873600,,1298,4.5

3771429,5,B001QWQJ9W,Had lots of cool fighting scenes and legendary Pokemon. I hated that Shaymin could talk though. Nintendo needs to stop the whole talking pokemon thing.,1338681600,,151,5.08

3771432,1,B001QWQJ9W,"I would rate zero.  Used item did not play and was defective. I sent it back to the wrong vendor and don't know if I will get it back for exchange.  My advice, don't buy used DVDs.",1295827200,,180,3.8378378378378377
3771433,2,B001QWQJ9W,"I love Pokemon! I have every single movie released on DVD. But I was way too old when Pokemon first came out (1998, I think?), and I'm definitely way too old now. But I can't help myself from buying these DVDs whenever they are released in the US. And it's not like the stories are any good, and I haven't played the games in years. But something about them makes me buy them every time they come out. Maybe it's because I already have them all and I just want to keep the collection going. It certainly can't be the story line. ""Pokemon is distressed. Ash saves the world. Pika pika!"" But as the Pokemon keep getting more and more ridiculous and more powerful and uglier, the characters keep getting more blah. I know this is a children's movie, but still, there can be a better storyline.

By the way, anyone know when the next one comes out?",1291420800,,844,4.341772151898734
3771434,3,B001QWQJ9W,"Pokemon: Giratina and the Sky Warrior is the eleventh film in the Pokemon franchise, and was directed by Kunihiko Yuyama.  This DVD was released on March 31, 2009, and it is the first Pokemon film to be distributed by Universal in the United States.

In this film, we meet the Legendary Pokemon Shaymin and Giratina, and Dialga makes a second appearance in a Pokemon film (with its first appearance being The Rise of Darkrai).

Like The Rise of Darkrai, Giratina and the Sky Warrior was released as a single disc.  On the disc, you can watch the film, use the setup menu to choose whether you want to have English subtitles as well as which English audio option you want, and you can choose where in the film you want to start watching.  When it comes to the subtitles, this disc includes a way to turn them off in the menu if your player decides to default to showing the English subtitles.

Another similarity this release shares with The Rise of Darkrai is the fact that there are no special features included on the disc.  The cost of this DVD has been priced to run the same amount as a DVD release that includes bonus features.  Personally, I would recommend buying a copy of Giratina and the Sky Warrior if you can find it somewhere that's selling it for under $15.

In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD through the King County Library System.",1288051200,,1377,4.4541832669322705
3771435,5,B001QWQJ9W,"I've always been a huge fan of pokemon, and this is truly one of the classics. I was kept on the edge of my seat the entire time as well; however, no special features. Other than that, it's a g-r-e-a-t movie.",1280880000,,208,4.097560975609756
3771436,5,B001QWQJ9W,"I'm a huge Pokemon fan and this movie is one of the best Pokemon movies i ever watch, i love it",1276560000,,95,3.5714285714285716
3771437,5,B001QWQJ9W,"`Giratina and the Sky Warrior' starts with an explosive bang. A Shaymin (tiny flowered hedgehog looking Pokemon) is delicately lapping water from a small lake when who should wander along but the titanic time controlling Pokemon, Dialga, to quench his own massive thirst. The idyllic scene is shattered by the appearance of Giratina who tears open a dimensional portal and drags Dialga down it into the Distortion World. In the ensuing whirlwind the diminutive Shaymin is inadvertently yanked along. What follows is a knock down drag out battle between Giratina and Dialga that is jaw dropping in scope. This is the first time a Pokemon movie has ever really wowed me. Poor Shaymin is buffeted around in the maelstrom while the battle is being observed by several interested parties. Finally, the panicking Shaymin shows that he too is no slouch by opening a dimensional rift allowing himself and Dialga to escape while locking Giratina behind. The animation in the opening sequence is light years ahead of what was seen in the early Pokemon movies and this was the moment for me when the series went past appealing to just Pokemon fans and arrived as a truly superior piece of animation.

Following the huge opening the film naturally relaxes and moves to Ash, Dawn and Brock who are, as always, traveling the countryside. During a picnic they come across the dirty but still mischievous Shaymin and discover that when cleaned up he not only literally blooms like a small flower patch but is also capable of speaking telepathically. The downside is that he's a bit of a snot although he eventually calms down as he gets used to Ash and friends. The general plot of the movie is that a fellow named Zero is looking to protect the Distortion World at the expense of the real world but to do this he needs to be able to travel back and forth between the two worlds and to do this he needs to capture Giratina and steal his powers. If I had one problem with this movie it's that the ending closely mirrors the ending of every single Pokemon movie ever made with the power of heart triumphing over evil. Of course this clich&eacute; is used in about half the anime out there.

As I stated earlier this movie transcends being just another Pokemon movie installment. This is a high quality animation with spectacular visuals and music and it just happens to feature Pokemon. The Pokemon license is essentially a license to print money but rather than coast along the producers are clearly in this for the long haul and consistently try to outdo the previous effort. The Diamond/Pearl trilogy is thus far the highlight of the Pokemon movie series but having seen the preview for the upcoming Phantom Ruler: Zoroark it looks as if OLM Incorporated is looking to once again raise the bar. This is the rare Pokemon movie that an adult can watch and not feel embarrassed. As the best of the Pokemon movies I'll give it the full five stars.",1274918400,,2928,4.716796875
3771438,5,B001QWQJ9W,Very happy with the video. One that our daughter had not seen yet. She was very excited about all the new characters.,1268265600,,117,4.363636363636363

This is the eleventh in the series and he likes it the most - much more than the others.  I've watched it with him and, from what I know of Pokemon, it follows an interesting storyline of Ash and his friends who are swept into the ""reverse world"" where Giratina lives.  There is a new Pokemon introduced in this movie - Shaymin.  She joins Ash's group or helps propel them into this latest adventure.  There are a lot of other Pokemon who make appearances including Regigigas.  There is some conflict and fighting that goes on but nothing too stunning or graphic.  There are some themes involved such as teamwork, environmentalism, friendship, compassion, and challenging powerful misdirected characters.  In one part Giratina is captured and is hurt, which generally isn't a good scene for youngsters, but with his friends help they help him escape and heal.  Overall, I think it is a fairly benign movie with good messages.  Maybe most important is that if you're a Pokemon fan then this is one to watch.",1252800000,6,1125,4.659898477157361

The art - like the entirety of the Diamond and Pearl arc - is some of the best seen in the entire series. But if you're looking for a story, don't come here. This is up there with the worst offenders of the Pokemon movies that focus farrr to much on their ""cute little legendary"" pokemon which the entire movie's plot is structured around that it drags the entire movie down with it. Shaymin is insufferable, the Villain's logic is ridiculous, Regigas plays no signifcant role (nor does Dialga, but his presence in this film is explained more in the 12th movie, which is actually pretty good) and Giratina deserved more than what he got.

Plus some of the dialogue is rather awkward.

If you have kids who love Pokemon, just check your library to see if they have a copy before you spend your money. Cause even kids will realize when they're watching a bad movie.",1459123200,,989,4.423076923076923
