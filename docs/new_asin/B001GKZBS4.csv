8305762,4,B001GKZBS4,"Like the first DVD David Strassman does an excellent job delivering stand-up with his colorful cast of puppets and his hand in special effects on stage. Although he may not be as well known as Jeff Dunham in the states I feel he most certainly deserves the same amount of fame.

PROS:
more ridiculous and funny comedy from David Strassman

Fun and good times for anyone who enjoys ventriloquists

CONS:
Although I enjoy this dvd it felt like some of the jokes kind of passed their prime at a certain point. but absolutely funny for the majority

In Closing this is another great stand-up by David Strassman to add to your collection. you will not be disappointed and might be able to convert some people to another great comedian.",1494979200,,730,4.635658914728682
8305763,4,B001GKZBS4,"Different type of ventriloquist and a very funny one, wish he was here in the states.  I've been doing ventriloquism for since 1975 and like his figures (dummy) mannerism, sort of like mine.",1420329600,,190,4.757575757575758

8305766,4,B001GKZBS4,"For over 30 years the insane mind of David Strassman has been entertaining people all over the world with his ventriloquism acts. The most famous of his creations are that of Chuck Wood, a deranged little puppet boy with a foul mouth who can spit on the crowed, have his evil eyes glow red, insult the audience, insult Dave and insult his colleague puppet Ted E. Bare who is a shy innocent character that sounds like Forrest Gump and Bert (& Ernie) with the tendency to make audiences go awww, or laugh when he decides to clean his privates.... coz he can!

Other puppets include an Alien named Kevin, a Beaver named Sid, A baby that I forget the name of, and in later shows introduced Ted E Bares grandfather, a robotic woman and several other characters.

Davis does both children and adult versions of his show when he tours, but the versions on the 3 DVD's he has released are all adult shows.

Strassman is American, but he has never really had all that much success in the USA, his mostly known through the U.K & even bigger in Australia.
In the mid to mid late 90's, David hosted his own show in both Australia and the U.K called ""Strassman"" where he did skits and interviews with the puppets.

These days when you think about ventriloquist acts, Jeff Dunham is stealing all the glory. But David Strassman has been around much longer, and in my opinion, is the much better & talented ventriloquist of the two. For anyone who has not seen Strassman, if you have the chance, go and see him, and you will see that you could argue who is better out of him and Jeff Dunham, but I guarantee you will love them both and they will be your at least your top 2.... and tho not a talented ventriloquist, but funny as hell, check out Otto & George, if your taste in humor is complete smut and you are you are not easily offended.

Also on these dvds, they contain bonus features that you really can call bonus features, each feature is a skit, or a documentary, everything is entertainment, so you won't be bored to sleep with behind the scenes footage and a roadie boring you with details about how the lighting effects are rigged up.

I'm sure it's possible, but i've never come across anyone who knows of, but does not like David Strassman. I was surprised to hear Dave and Chuck Wood do a small bit on the Bob & Tom radio show once, so hopefully someone in America will recognize Strassmans talent and he can become the success in his home country that he has made for himself in Eurpoe and Australia.",1248220800,,2500,4.412147505422993
8305767,3,B001GKZBS4,"I appreciated the talent Strassman has for his ventriloquism, but I was disappointed I could not show it to my family.  There is a warning about its explicit content, but I guess I didn't realize how explicit a ventriloquist can be.  Though I know it is part of Chuck's character the f-bomb got to be way overdone.",1245715200,2,314,4.491228070175438
8305768,5,B001GKZBS4,"This DVD is so funny it hurts! I loved his first video 'Strassman Live' and this one lived up to all expectations!
I have seen him live many times, and watching the DVD is as great as watching him in real life!
Hysterical David! Keep up the good work!",1225411200,,251,4.142857142857143
