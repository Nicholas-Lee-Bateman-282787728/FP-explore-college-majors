8184114,3,B000OAG1Q8,"The most significant thing about ""Enter the Eagles"" is that it marks the true initiation of Shannon Lee into her all-too-short action movie career, more so than her supporting role in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/High-Voltage/dp/B0000A2ZR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">High Voltage</a>&nbsp;and the future embarrassment that was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lessons-For-an-Assassin/dp/B00009KU9U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lessons For an Assassin</a>. The worst thing this film could have done was marginalize her presence, but thankfully, the promotion doesn't lie: Shannon, daughter of the late Bruce, is the undisputed star of this one. This isn't enough to make the movie great on its own, but if you're buying this for Lee's sake, at least be assured that you're really getting her.

The story: when a deal between a group of thieves and a Russian criminal faction goes awry, professional burglar Marty (Michael Wong,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Thunderbolt/dp/B000BVM1QO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Thunderbolt</a>), sharpshooter Mandy (Lee), and pickpockets Lucy (Anita Yuen,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/From-Beijing-with-Love/dp/B00005ALMT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">From Beijing with Love</a>) and Tommy (Jordan Chan,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Big-Bullet/dp/6305161593/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Big Bullet</a>) will need to fight for their lives against the forces and influence of the evil Karloff (Benny Urquidez,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wheels-on-Meals/dp/6305234922/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wheels on Meals</a>).

The Region 2 UK release I purchased featured a maddeningly cropped picture, but even this couldn't destroy the quality of the fight scenes. The martial arts choreography by Tak Yuen (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Legend-of-Fong-Sai-Yuk/dp/B001MEJY9Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Legend of Fong Sai Yuk</a>) isn't going to be the best you've ever seen but it's still plenty fun to watch and makes everybody comes across well. Shannon Lee really hogs the hand-to-hand action and looks good doing it: not only are her moves smooth, convincing, and graceful, but she appears to be doing just about all of her own fighting and relies only minimally on a stunt double. The only possible drawback of the kung fu is that the end brawl between Shannon and Benny Urquidez doesn't really live up to the latter's two legendary bouts with Jackie Chan (but then again, few fights do). A few shootouts are also littered about, with the centerpiece of the film being an extended gunfight/chase scene in a police station; it's not terribly exciting, but is capped by an awesome high-rise ladder stunt and a scene wherein Michael Wong bungee jumps from a helicopter and shoots a couple henchmen on the fly.

Considering that this 1998 movie looks more like the grainy police stories of the mid-'80s than a polished flick of the times, it's easy to ascertain that production values are not the film's strongest point. This doesn't hurt the movie, but the fact that things get kinda slow and boring when there's no fighting or shooting going on does. All of the performers get to flex their acting muscles a bit for the colorful characters they play, but the questionable English dub can ruin this easily. Real drama isn't the movie's virtue, but it does feature a surprisingly moving scene in (SPOILER) the death of Jordan Chan's character. There's also a pretty satisfying scene during the finale wherein Lucy becomes so enraged at the sight of her partner/boyfriend's killer that the henchman she's fighting takes flight rather than face her ferocity.

As an afterthought, ""Enter the Eagles"" features too many flying zoom-ins on characters' faces; it's a minor nitpick, but enough of these add up enough to deny the film a higher rating. Hong Kong devotees will probably find it a bit easier to digest than me, but I maintain that this one could've been a classic rather than the pretty-good time killer that it ends up being. Shannon Lee made a good choice in hooking up with director Corey Yuen - I only wish it had been on one of his better days.",1297987200,3,4391,6.276948590381426
