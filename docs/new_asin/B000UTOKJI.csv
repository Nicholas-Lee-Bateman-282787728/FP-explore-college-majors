8214738,4,B000UTOKJI,Quite good for a first opera by one of my favorite composers..,1442188800,,62,4.25
8214739,3,B000UTOKJI,"I love modern opera. I prefer it to the Puccinis and Verdis. I sometimes travel just to hear Berg, Janacek, Prokofiev, Sallinen, Saariaho, Ades, Adams .... and most avidly the Henzes, wherever they're staged. But this production of Henze's early effort at resuscitating the story of Manon Lescaut bores me to tears. It's as musically vapid as Puccini's Manon Lescaut, or so it sounds on this DVD. Would a different conductor wring more from the score? The singing is not at fault, though the recording quality is rather thin. And the staging is dire without being intellectually disturbing, like a reproduction of a German Expressionist painting in black-and-white. I usually like to take my Depravity with a fillip of Insight.

But... I WILL watch&hear this DVD again in a few weeks, and if my second impression is different, I'll revise this review.",1288137600,2,851,4.992957746478873
8214740,5,B000UTOKJI,"First, what happened to this DVD?  It was only available for such a short time.  Are they repackaging it?  Were the sales that dismal?  Well, if you can find it and you are a Henze fan, buy it.  This was Henze's first full-length opera--(he wrote two short ""radio"" operas before it, so it ISN'T his first opera, despite what some people seem to think.)  He threw in every kind of music he was studying at the time and came up with a (still) controversial modern re-telling of Manon Lescaut.  You know immediately this is not your familiar Manon Lescaut when the first and last scenes take place in a present time (1950's) train station (at least in this version.  In the libretto, Des Grieux waits outside a prison to catch a glimpse of Manon as she is being transferred from one to another.)  And within minutes, you see Manon and her brother scope out their next victim.  They are, in fact, grifters looking for an easy mark.  True, Manon does feel a tiny bit of remorse, but she commits murder to stay out of prison, and gets caught merely by chance.  Chance or ""fate"" plays a big part in the story.  People meet by chance, fall in love by chance, steal something valuable they did not expect to find by chance, (as mentioned) get caught in a murder by chance, etc.  In this production, a giant clock is like a mute heartless witness watching over the tragic story.  The ending is cold and brutal, and only Des Grieux sings, hopeless and already emotionally dead.  Fun, right?  Yes.

First, the update sheds all sentimentality (though not sentiment)--just right for a ""50's opera by a young composer.  And the music is magnificent in its variety.  No two scenes have the same tonal scheme, from lyrical twelve-tone music for the lovers, Gregorian chant for some students, tonality for the peripheral characters, jazz, an impressionistic drug scene, etc.  Seven scenes in all, played without a break and not needing one at roughly an hour and a half.  Not an extraneous note.  This fine production does full justice to the story, though it is not slavish to the original libretto.  What makes it all work, of course, are the wonderful singers.  The two lovers are portrayed by Laura Aikin and Par Lindskog, both marvelous.  Her slight artificiality and his over reaction to his first love affair are beautiful foils for each other.  The fact that Lindskog is over-weight just makes him seem even more the patsy and even more pitiable when he falls for such a seductress.  Tom Fox as her brother is just as fine and the smaller roles are all handled idiomatically and convincingly.  The Orchestra from Liceu and the conductor Zoltan Pesko have the music well in hand.  But get it for the portrayals and the music.  Everything else is just gravy.  I hope you can find it.",1263600000,,2771,4.637860082304527
8214741,4,B000UTOKJI,"This is my first exposure to Henze. I was skeptical at first, but I was won over - less by the music itself than by the whole package. The fit between music and production seems fine to me. Yes, there are no memorable tunes - so what else is new with modern music? But the whole thing works nicely. The cast is good too although closeups don't exactly help make the 2 lovers look as young as they are supposed to be. Not all that big a quibble.",1206144000,7,444,4.056818181818182
8214742,5,B000UTOKJI,"A magnificent score by Hans Werner Henze, and a mesmerizing production of it. The ingenious stage design is narcotic: '50s deco-inspired, lean-and-gleam Hopperesque economy treated with gorgeous colors, displaying an intimate relationship to the score itself. Henze's atmospheric colors are embodied in stage and set design, even in the subtly charged costuming. A decayed eroticism lurks, suggests, but never shows its full face. The piece progresses to warm deep colors as if by sadness. I find in Henze's wondrous scores an heir more of Stravinsky than Schoenberg. His unique fusion of serialism and tonality finds new ground in Boulevard Solitude. The singers are excellent. An heroic job by Swedish tenor Par Lindskog as Armand, his sturdy musicianship and beautifully polished tone never flag. Laura Aikin, a great Lulu in European houses, sings Manon wrenchingly, with seductive pianissimos and a terrific sense of the stage. Henze plies their relationship with erotic and terrifying music, and beautiful silences. Like Stravinsky, Henze's every musical gesture is scrupulously orchestrated to make dazzling musical beauty. Manon's character ends unsorry, and Henze gives her much of his amazing diaphanous music. His scores are never cloying or dismissive; attuned to theatricality like an alchemist, Henze's art is intense, profound and moving. Big recommendation for a really fine night at the theatre. The 80 year old composer, present for the performance, is cheered effusively at the end by a thrilled Liceu Theatre audience in Barcelona. You won't be disappointed.",1198281600,20,1578,5.551867219917012
8214743,5,B000UTOKJI,I bought and listened to the old Cascavelle recording of this work and was not impressed or won over. It just shows how important it is for at least some operas to be seen. I am VERY impressed by the present DVD. The musical side of things is wonderful. But now to see the old story of Manon and her DesGrieux acted out in the present brings out the sheer power of this work. This production won the Olivier prize and certainly deserves it. Don't be afraid of serialism. The opera is actually closer to Stravinsky than Schoenberg. Henze only uses serial methods for the lovers as they fall deeper and deeper into their delusion. For an exhilirating evening of theater check this out.,1191888000,19,683,4.516129032258065
