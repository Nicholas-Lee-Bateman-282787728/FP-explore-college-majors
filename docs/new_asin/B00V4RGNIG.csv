People have been telling me for years to check out the 2003 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series, but its been difficult to track down the long out of print DVDs. Once Nickelodeon picked up the license for the property and produced the smash-hit 2012 TMNT revival, fans hoped that the 2003 series would get a re-release. That day has finally arrived, with Nick offering up two volumes of the show with three episodes each. Here were taking a look at Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Search For Splinter, available on DVD June 9th.

The first episode on the disk, Things Change, sees the turtles underground sewer lair attacked by robotic Mousers. When the mechanized menaces chew through the steel and concrete of the lair, it causes a collapse that separates the four brothers from their sensei. While attempting to track their master down, the gang runs into the Purple Dragon street thugs, stopping some petty crime along the way. There really isn't a whole lot to this episode, and before long the turtles are reunited with Splinter, who has already picked out a new, upgraded sewer lair to call home. This was the very first episode of the 2003 series, which was a bit surprising to me  there are no character introductions or references to the turtles origins at all. The show basically just assumes you know who everyone is and jumps right into it.

The Search For Splinter, Part 1 is the first half of a two-part season finale, so its a bit weird jumping right from the beginning of the season to the end. We meet one of the Guardians, who the turtles believe know where Splinter is (apparently hes missing again here). Mikey throws a tracker on his sword, which leads the group to the TCRI building. As Leo mentions, the canister of ooze that the turtles were created from bore the initials TCRI, so they hope to find not only their sensei but also answers about their past. April and Casey Jones help distract the security downstairs, while the four brothers infiltrate the building from the roof. Things go awry, however, when a ventilation shaft knocks Mikey and Donnie clear off the roof in a cliffhanger ending. There are some funny moments throughout this episode showcasing Caseys dimwitted personality and anger issues; the sight of him beating a toaster with his trademark bat and screaming for tech support was pretty hilarious. Give me a toasta, or give me death!

In The Search for Splinter, Part 2, the turtles finally manage to make it inside the TCRI building, and realize things are definitely not what they seem. Tracking the security team to a decidedly alien-looking hideout, the brothers bear witness as the creatures shed their humanoid skin, revealing their true form  gross-looking aliens with the appearance of a human brain. The Turtles are soon discovered by the alien creatures, who call themselves Utroms, leading to a large-scale battle in the depths of TCRI. The episode closes with the brothers accidentally stepping onto some sort of teleporter, and being transported somewhere unknown while one of the Utrom leaders looks on in a frenzied panic.

Nickelodeons re-release of 2003s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles series is off to a solid start with The Search For Splinter. The picture and audio quality are good for what it is (video is standard-definition full screen), and the assortment of episodes in this collection are exciting and engaging, with plenty of action and humor. I do think it was a strange decision to have such a large gap between the first and second episode on this disk  viewers will likely feel confused watching the Turtles interact with characters that have not been introduced to the audience. Perhaps the storyline will feel more coherent after watching the second compilation of episodes, NYC Showdown, which also releases June 9th. Also, I feel as though Nick could have thrown more than three episodes on the disk, and hopefully a full season set is on the horizon (Im really not a fan of stringing together random compilation DVDs to watch a full season). Overall though, this is a fun DVD release that any TMNT fan will want to pick up; Im definitely looking forward to more releases so I can catch up!",1433203200,,4207,4.84144645340751

Ever since Nickelodeon picked up the license for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles property and produced the smash-hit 2012 revival, fans have hoped that the 2003 series would get a re-release. That day has finally arrived, with Nick offering up two volumes of the show with three episodes each. Here were taking a look at Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: NYC Showdown, available on DVD June 9th.

Return To New York, Pt. 1 begins with the Turtles, Splinter, Casey and April cautiously returning to the underground sewer lair after a previous battle with the Shredder. Oroku Saki and the Foot Clan believe the Turtles to be vanquished after an explosion at Aprils, and Leo and Raph come to the realization that this could have its advantages  like the element of surprise. They come up with a plan to infiltrate the Foot Clan headquarters, with the aid of a powerful, mystical sword that was taken from the Shredder. This first episode of NYC Showdown has lots of great action, as the Turtles battle invisible Foot soldiers, Raph commandeers a hi-tech flying gadget from the Foots armory, and the gang comes face to face with some grotesque, mutated Shredder clones.

Return To New York, Pt. 2 continues right from the ending of Part 1, with the Turtles still in a heated battle with the mutant Shredder replicas. The entire team must work together to overcome these odds, with Splinter joining the action and April providing hacking and intel support to help lead the gang to Shredders lair. Its certainly no cakewalk getting there  the Turtles run into plenty of traps along the way, as well as mystical guardians representing the five elements that Master Splinter must dispatch with the help of Shredders powerful blade. And by the time they finally reach the big guy and take down his team of goons, Baxter Stockman makes his presence known, looking to take down both Oroku Saki and the Turtles with his gigantic robot suit.

The final episode on Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: NYC Showdown, Return to New York, Pt. 3, is packed with wall-to-wall action from start to finish. The Turtles must team up with Shredder if they hope to take down Baxter Stockmans enormous mechanical weaponry, and the ensuing battle lasts for almost half the episode. Defeating Stockmans mech suit takes a mix of not only brute force between the Turtles, Splinter and Shredder but also Donnies intellect. As soon as Stockmans robot is defeated, its right back to battling between the Shredder and the Turtles, as they fight for control over the mystical Sword of Tengu. The Guardians pop in to help the Turtles out and keep the sword away from Oroku Saki, and eventually it comes down to a one-on-one test of strength between Leo and Shredder, which ends dramatically when Leo decapitates (!) his metallic foe. Its soon revealed that Shredder is somehow still alive, as before the closing credits hes seen picking up his separated head and putting it back on his body. So theres either something supernatural at work here, or Shredder is some kind of robotic creation in this series. When Leo goes to check on the injured Splinter after the battle is won, hes nowhere to be found the ol lovable rat sure seems to get lost a lot in this series.

Overall, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: NYC Showdown is another solid retro release from Nickelodeon, yet these collections have their flaws. Each DVD set so far only features three episodes (with no extras), and the episodes have not been released in order, meaning that if youve never watched this particular Turtles series before you will feel very lost and confused. These compilation sets are fine for a series like Regular Show, where each episode is self-contained story-wise, but there are plenty of unexplained plot threads and unfamiliar characters here which hampered my enjoyment while viewing this collection. That said, the animation is fantastic, the action is engaging and the humor doesnt disappoint. Im hoping that eventually Nickelodeon will re-release each season in a complete set, so newcomers to this show will get to enjoy it as it was meant to be watched, in the order it originally aired.",1433203200,2,4169,4.888260254596888
7076386,3,B00V4RGNIG,"While I am glad that there bringing this out on DVD again, looking at this makes me think there taking a big step back.  At one point just before Nick took over TMNT there where DVD sets that took up half a season each, had a nice clean look and was a very cost effective way to collect the show.  Now with this it reminds me of what it was before that set, when a set only had a few episodes in a box and you had to find many to finish a season.  I'm not overly bothered by this but I was hoping that since they had kept up decent sets of episodes with the new show that they would had done the same if they started putting this show on DVD.

As for this set of shows, there a good set though I'm not sure why they are starting in the middle of the story rather then at the start.  The main thing I am hoping for is them to get to season 3 that has not had any DVD rerelease.",1432598400,2,876,3.7650273224043715

7076393,3,B00V4RGNIG,My family watched this three times straight. Enjoyable if you like the Turtles. Title and cover is misleading. DVD only contains one Christmas cartoon and the others are not holiday related. Took away stars for that.,1478131200,,216,5.027777777777778

7076395,1,B00V4RGNIG,"I bought this on a whim in a brick and mortar store as a 'fun holiday' thing to watch some cold winter night. The DVD is fine quality and it is indeed the true 2003 variation of the turtle cartoons, however the title is a bit misleading.

The tile and cover of this DVD imply that the episodes within would be Christmas episodes, but unfortunately only the first one was a Christmas episode, the other ones have nothing to do with Christmas.

If you just want to have a few episodes to watch of the 2003 turtles, then this is great. But if you want to have a holiday themed DVD to watch, only the first 20 min falls into that category. Even my 3yo was asking ""I though this was a Christmas show?""",1456444800,5,696,4.186567164179104
7076396,4,B00V4RGNIG,"First of all I just would like to say that the shows are great and it's a cheap price for this DVD considering that the previous DVD release is a little pricey now. That was the reason I bought this as I was missing the Christmas episode from my collection. I really like the cover too, it looks nice and all. But what I'm disappointed with is how the episodes were handled. There is a extra animation in between where the commercials used to be. It just kind of stands out since the 4kids release of these didn't have that. I might be nitpicking but as I said the episodes are great and if you don't have these episodes yet it's a cheap price. Though I wish they would have released season 3 to continue what 4kids had started. They are just going back to these 3 or 4 episode DVDs again just to get extra money. Also if you're buying this for kids they will like it.",1453939200,,868,4.1726190476190474

7076399,5,B00V4RGNIG,I'm a huge TMNT fan and a sucker for Christmas specials so my view is a bit biased but I love it. The 2003 series has had some garbage releases but this one is pretty solid for the price. You get the full special and a couple bonus episodes.,1452988800,,241,3.938775510204082

7076403,3,B00V4RGNIG,"Out of all of Nick's releases of the 2003 animated series, this is the only one that is decent so far. Not because they gave a release fans have been waiting for, but because of the inclusion of the original DTDVD Christmas special that is not on any of the previously released box sets. The old version is available used with different bonus episodes (Nano, Things Change and Shredder Strikes), but is quite expensive. If you have to get this, this is a good used price. Still, it's the same old stuff.",1448150400,,503,4.478260869565218
7076404,1,B00V4RGNIG,"Released to coincide with the 2012 version of the ""Return To New York"" adaptations, this is Nick desperately grasping for cash by re-releasing a paltry 3-episodes in the same basic format they appeared about 10 years earlier on what are now long OOP and hard to find DVDs. Considering these episodes appear on the second half of season one DVD set previously put out, do yourself a favor and ignore this insulting cash grab and just get a used copy of that. There is no reason other than greed, to put this out again like this.",1448150400,2,527,4.5
7076405,1,B00V4RGNIG,"When Nick acquired the rights to TMNT they interrupted half season releases of this show that fans had waited several years and single volume releases to get (even the 87 show finally got a complete season 3 compilation and subsequent full season sets after following the same pattern.) After loyal fans put up with singular, mostly, 3 episode releases for 3 seasons, they put out half of season 4 (with a bonus unaired episode, considered too graphic for children television), followed by season 5 (or the lost season) and released seasons 1 and 2 in halves as well as season 6 (7 only saw release in Australia, oddly enough).

Well, after all of that, Nick decides to turn the clock back to milk a new generation (the 2012 show's fans) looking to see what last decades show is like. This single, 3-episode, disk features the pilot and the 2-part season one finale. In spite of what some reviewers say it is not a terrible paring (while it is a huge gap for the show, it is based on issue #1, 2 and 4 of the original comics and it does flow as such.  Still, not the best way to see this.)

This has no extras, generic artwork and a simple standard definition transfer. The show has since returned to the air via reruns. Just watch that, or buy used copied of the original half seasons sets. If no one buys these they'll get the picture.",1448150400,,1337,4.448979591836735
7076406,5,B00V4RGNIG,"I love the shows on it, but in between the time of what would be commercials, didn't necessarily need the loud sayings. They were often louder than the show itself. I like the cover on this DVD box. I love Leo's big smile. And I also like how when you first play the disc that this time around you don't get stuck watching a boring preview about a dumb video game that you can't skip over like with the other one.",1448064000,2,413,4.111111111111111

8709079,2,B00V4RGNIG,"Let's talk about the technical aspects of this DVD.  First off, it's clearly inferior in quality when compared to the earlier Funimation / 4Kids release titled Michaelangelo's Christmas Rescue.  That earlier disc treated the video correctly by using a 4:3 aspect ratio and the full horizontal resolution that DVD is capable of.  In other words, the DVD player added the black bars to the sides of the picture.  This release puts a 4:3 picture inside of a 16:9 space so that the video is actually pillarboxed by having the black side bars encoded into the video.  This results in lower resolution with a less defined, blurrier picture.  Additionally, this disc just has more noise in the picture.  The random compression noise that is all too common on DVD.

If none of this makes sense to you, then let me sum it up: This version is worse than the previous release, which is a sad situation.  If Nickelodeon ever releases the rest of the 2003 series, then I would hope they do not follow this format.",1518393600,,1000,4.668571428571428
