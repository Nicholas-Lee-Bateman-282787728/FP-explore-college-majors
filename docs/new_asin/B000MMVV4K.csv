8170176,2,B000MMVV4K,"I was hoping to learn more knitting and crochet skills with this dvd. I am very disappointed. The knitting and crochet skills that demonstraed in the dvd are so basic you can learn in youtube. Youtube has more knitting and crochets skills that you can learn for the beginner to advance knitter and crocheters than this dvd. This dvd is not suitable to intermediate and advance knitter who are hoping to learn some knitting and crochet skills at their level. In the dvd, there was a talk about alpaca yarn, how it has lustre and light and warmer than wool, but all the alpaca yarns(which are blend) I see are dull, harsh to the skin and not lighter than wool but at four times the price of natural wool. Although I must admit I like the talk about colour, but this not show how to use it in your knitting. This dvd is more talking about knitting than the actual teaching the knitting skills.",1279238400,,890,4.432926829268292
8170177,5,B000MMVV4K,"I learned how to crochet on my own with NO classes besides this DVD ""Art of Knitting and Crochet 2"" and another one called ""Crochet in Motion"" It took me about a week of starting the dvd, getting frustrated, turning it off,,,then trying again later! It's very awkward at first on how to hold your fingers.  Do NOT give up.  Just try again later.  I was determined I was going to master this,,and I finally did which means anyone can do it!  Now I'm totally hooked.  I never leave home when I travel without my crochet gear.  I'm always making something.  It's very relaxing and calming.  A great stress reliever.  If you think you don't have time......think again! Oh by the way,,,if you are buying this DVD as a very beginner knitter, you will be disappointed.  This is not a great dvd for knitting.  It does not teach you how to get started in knitting like it does in crocheting.  It has a small portion of more advance knitting techniques but not if you are just learning how to knit.  It does have a very beginner portion for crochet which is great.  It also includes a few patterns to stitich along with.  I wish there were more DVD stitch along patterns in crochet out there!  Love those!  If you are learning how to crochet,,,you will love this DVD! :)  Julie :)",1205712000,3,1270,4.424242424242424

8170179,2,B000MMVV4K,I did not think this DVD was worth the money. It jumped around a lot and was not helpful. There are better and more complete DVD's out there than this. I was also not impressed with the art of knit and crochet either. It was just as bad. I was very disappointed.,1191369600,,262,4.0576923076923075
8170180,4,B000MMVV4K,it's perfict for begginers and there are useful things not so much instruction. you have to watch it to figer it out. which that is why it is a dvd.,1170806400,2,148,3.966666666666667
8170181,5,B000MMVV4K,"Check out my other more detailed review for this DVD at the Leisure Arts/Tricoast Studios listing here on amazon.

A great second volume from the folks at The Art of Knitting.

Jam packed with knitting, crochet, felting, sock knitting...it's amazing!",1154476800,2,250,5.225
