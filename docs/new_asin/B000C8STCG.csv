This movie deserves a much wider audience.",1493164800,,189,4.9375

Needed a bit more personality for other characters as well* However, some other aspects of the story--added the positive value to it. Highly recommended*****",1317600000,,262,4.9772727272727275

Gato (Diego Peretti) is a car thief.  He has a deal with a local chop shop to deliver stolen cars.  His preference is taxicabs. Not content with merely stealing the car, Gato also works the taxi.

As he drives around Buenos Aires at night picking up fares you get the feeling that he's dreaming of a different life.  A life where he makes an honest living doing something he enjoys - driving around the city when it's dark and quiet, meeting a variety of people.  As he explains later, more than anything else he wants to talk with people and exchange ideas.  At night, in the taxi you meet people; sometime they're not what they seem to be.  You're with them for a while and that's it - you never see them again.

He's feeling pretty lucky until he picks up a very nervous young girl (Josefina Viton).  She starts to give him directions, and then slumps over on the seat.  He discovers she has been shot.  His first instinct is to abandon the girl and the car, but he finds he just can't leave her to die alone.  He also can't drive her to a hospital - there would be too many uncomfortable and dangerous questions.

Peretti gives a magnetic performance.  True, the hero is an armed robber.  Yet it's hard not to feel empathy for Gato as he recounts the details of that night.

Written, directed and produced by Gabriela David.  Great night scenes of Buenos Aires from cinematographer, Miguel Abal.  Nice score by composer, Mariano Nuez West.

Special features include a photo gallery and trailer.  In Spanish with optional English subtitles.

Highly recommended!",1241222400,3,1691,4.619528619528619
