1239867,5,B00000JZIM,"This is more or less the practical lesson that shows this movie. Truly, the obscene words and actuations of Lenny Bruce as seen in the screen could hardly scandalize nobody today, but well instead there are the mode of the politically correct.
Yes, this comedian had a life a little frivolous, abused of drugs, had big success with women, but they love him: a very rare case few men know how achieve, and at last an entertainer rarely can drive his life as a judge (or yes?).
The final conclusion for me is similar for many biographies of original scientists, artists, writers and in general, genial people or perhaps simply over the media: you can be different, you can even do exceptional discoveries... but that isn't good for your health because it disturbs ""normal people"".",1029801600,,778,4.770370370370371
1239868,5,B00000JZIM,"Dustin Hoffman gives a brilliant Oscar nominated performance as the controversial comic, Lenny Bruce. Lenny spent years trying to make it big in comedy being obscene and using bad terms and language and when he finally made it big, he destroyed himself. The best part about this film is the performance of Oscar Nominee Valerie Perrine as his wife, Honey Bruce. I hate it when people say, ""oh, she gave a nice SUPPORTING performance."" Valerie's performance was intrical to the plot and she's on screen for more than 50 minutes, which is more than I can say for Louise Fletcher of ""one flew over the cukoo's nest."" This is probably the most overlooked and under rated films of all time and it shouldn't be. It's just a shame that everyone involved with the film went on to great careers and Valerie Perrine ended up turning into a whatever happened to? star!

Dustin Hoffman did a Good Job though I don't think He fully captured all of the Energy&Edge that Lenny Bruce had.but He did a Good Job&should be given some Props for doing such a Challenging role.

1239870,5,B00000JZIM,"Bob Fosse directs this wonderfully made film documenting the life of Lenny Bruce, played sympathetically by Dustin Hoffman. Filmed in B&W and in faux-documentary style, the film follows Lenny Bruce from the start of his career and his doomed marriage with his wife. With an anonymous interviewer recording conversations with the people around him, including his mother, wife and manager, this 70s portrait of Lenny Bruce is an intimate look at the comic's career and life. It's incredible to see Hoffman's almost boyish charm and look at the beginning of the film to the rough, tired look towards the end. Fosse never looses control of the film and allows every actor the chance to shine.",1018310400,,688,4.991304347826087
1239871,5,B00000JZIM,"A powerful biography of the brilliant but doomed night-club comedian Lenny Bruce. Taking the form of a pseudo documentary, an unseen interviewer questions Bruce's wife, mother, and agent about his life. We are shown  Bruce's early 50's beginnings as an unremarkable comic performing hackneyed  material. He then meets Honey Harlow, the stripper who becomes his wife.  Their marriage is happy at first. Then they get involved with drugs and  swinging, which cause problems and they eventually divorce. This first half  of the film uses the effective technique of frequently cutting to one of  Bruce's later performances to illustrate how these experiences inspired  some of his routines. Meanwhile, during a period working as an MC in strip  joints, Bruce develops the improvisational style for which he became  famous. He moves back to the nigh-clubs, wher his daring satire brings him  acclaim and (initially) fortune. Eventually the authorities take notice,  and he is subjected to a string of busts for obscenity and drugs, which  make it increasingly difficult to get work. Bruce's legal and money  problems pile up, and he finally dies of a drugs overdose. In some ways  then, Lenny is a typical Hollywood rags-to-riches-to-rags biopic, but here  spiced up with a liberal dose of 70's permissiveness. Its sparse Black and  white photography effectively compliments Bruce's increasing despair. The  supporting cast are all good, and Valerie Perrine is particularly strong as  Bruce's wife. But it is Dustin Hoffman who dominates the film. His  performance as Bruce is compelling, especially in the night-club scenes.  Precious little film exists of the real Lenny Bruce in live performance.  Watching Hoffman recreate his routines is the next best thing. For that  alone, this film is to be commended.",961545600,7,1805,5.303886925795053
1239872,5,B00000JZIM,"This is a brillant review of Lenny Bruce's life.  I was so mesmerized by this movie, I have read all the books of Lenny and Honey's life.  It is truly fascinating.
I have read the other reviews that say Dustin Hoffman  wasn't cast correctly.  I'm not sure I agree with that as I can't envision  anyone else.  Irrespective, Valerie Perrine was perfectly cast.
This is  not light entertainment so I suggest you have an interest in the subject or  the time period.  Also, his life style was not typical so conservative  republicans may want to stay away from this movie.  It might be a little  upsetting to them.",959299200,4,609,4.537037037037037

1239900,1,B00000JZIM,"I watched this movie recently and couldn't wait for it to end. It was like watching two sick people slowly die. There is almost no laughter or comedy in this movie. You would never know that Lenny Bruce was a very funny and clever man who made many hilarious comedy albums that were not vulgar or unsuitable for a family to listen to. He also wrote a funny book titled ""How To Talk Dirty And Influence People"". There is no joy in this movie, only misery that keeps getting worse! The scenes where Dustin Hoffman is on stage performing as Lenny Bruce are strangely bereft of
any laughter or good cheer. There is no balance between all the social commentary he does on stage and making people laugh, as there should have been. Valarie Perrine's acting is very good, but cannot save this turkey of a movie. What a shame that those who produced this movie didn't
show Lenny Bruce's true worth and why he was so popular. It does a great disservice to one of this country's comedy icons.",1433116800,2,981,4.455555555555556

1239919,5,B00000JZIM,"Biopics come and go, and actors take on legendary faces and win Oscars all the time, but what sets a real great biopic apart from the pack is a vision; a unique and gifted way of storytelling that makes it all feel more natural, organic and impactful.

Lenny has that.

The film is sharp from start to finish and contains a brilliant performance by Dustin Hoffman who not only captures the sheer wit and comedic timing of Lenny Bruce, but unravels his emotional layers with ease and dominance.  His chemistry with Valerie Perrine is also blessed and helps keep our attention streamlined to where it needs to be.  Fosse made a lot of smart choices here, and filming it in black and white was one of them.  The grit that envelops the film helps us to put into place the realities of Lennys life and not forget that this is a drama about a comic and not the other way around.  Bruces career and his tumultuous relationships as well as the way that his message as an artist was so ahead of the times are strong factors in this film and help flesh out a top notch biopic that feels alive, fresh and original.  Even today, this is a treasure and a complete film.

This movie is a good overview of Lenny's life, but also shows some of his Stand-up routines which are very funny on their own. Dustin Hoffman does a spectacular job of bring Lenny to life and portraying him as a very funny yet frustrated comedian. Lenny fought the free speech battle for other comedians, making it clear that he was not trying to offend anyone, just trying to entertain.

1239925,2,B00000JZIM,"This is the story of Lenny Bruce. You should know that when I was in college I lived in a co-op named Lenny Bruce House. We used to joke that he was the founder of the house, but of course he probably never even knew about it. Still, it gave me a connection to Lenny Bruce, and I had at least one of his comedy albums. In the days before You Tube, comedians did stand up acts in clubs and they made talking record albums.

This is a depressing movie in much the same way that ""Lady Sings the Blues"" was. Our entertainers are especially vulnerable to drug addiction, it's the world they live in, and the pressures under which they perform. But it doesn't make watching the stories of their lives any more pleasant.

The story is told in a series of interviews with the people closest to him: his wife Honey (Valerie Perrine), his agent and his mother. They each tell the story from their own point of view, and so we get to see Lenny through a variety of eyes. There are also several scenes of him doing his club act, interacting with the audience and, inevitably, the cops, judges, attorneys and so forth that eventually drove him to overdose. Whether that overdose was a suicide or not was never conclusively determined.

Honey was a stripper when Lenny met her, and he was a beginning stand-up comic and not very funny. He was also not controversial yet, and the two are clearly related. Watching the development of his act, it is clear he did not start to move his audiences until he got involved in attempting to shock them. He accidentally shocked some people by saying something to the band when he did not realize the microphone was live. The manager of the club insisted he should apologize. So he did, and then quit by saying he was going to piss on the audience. (It is not shown whether he did in fact piss.)

Honey found Lenny cute and funny and smart, and crazy in love with her. She was as flattered as any woman would be, even one as beautiful as she was at the time. After a giddy, whirlwind courtship, he proposed and they were married. Then he took her home to meet his mother.

Mom was a stand-up comic herself in her day, on the borscht circuit in the Catskills. She gave Lenny his first break by having him stand in for an MC in one of her shows when the MC didn't show up. She started by telling the audience he was the funniest guy in the world, when he'd never been on stage before in his life! So she tells this story to Honey, while the sour old aunt keeps asking, ""So how long did you and Lenny know each other before you were married?"" Finally, Honey says it was just hours, and they make a big joke of it at the old aunt's expense.

For awhile, Honey worked a duo act with Lenny, but it didn't work out too well. Also, she started doing heroin. Then she went back to stripping to support her habit, and eventually she and Lenny got divorced. Their little girl was one year old at the time. Lenny got custody, Honey went to Hawaii, where she was busted for possession again. She spent some two years in prison there. In the interview later, she said that the year after she got out of the Hawaiian prison and went back with Lenny, she was busted 13 times. One wonders how she got off from one charge to the next in order to have time to be busted that often.

A lot of things are not clear in this movie, including when Lenny was or was not doing drugs, what the sequence of events was with regard to his criminal cases, and so on. That's one of the problems with the interview and flashback format. But one thing that struck me was that after the first charge of obscenity, where Lenny got off because a jury said what he had said and done was not obscene, he started reading transcripts of his trials to his audiences and commenting on them. Finally, he was not funny, he was obsessed.

The most tragic scene of all was when he was stoned out of his mind, wearing nothing but a trench coat, and went on stage to ramble and rage and eventually apologize for not being funny. As he went back to his dressing room, he was arrested for drugs.

Dustin Hoffman does a great job in this movie, and so does Valerie Perrine. Both are believable in their roles, although in Perrine's case, I'm not sure that is a compliment. In spite of this, the movie is not only depressing, it is unsatisfying. I think I'd rather see a movie of actual footage of the real Lenny. I cannot recommend the film, but it has one star: Dustin Hoffman.",1336953600,,4450,4.2943980929678185

1239927,4,B00000JZIM,"Lenny Bruce was a troubled man, in my opinion, largely because of what he saw as justice applied unevenly. His ""blue"" routines, which repeatedly got him arrested and jailed, were nothing in terms of vulgarity or obscenity compared to what would come later. The courts and officers of the law seemed to be targeting Lenny at times. When he educated himself in the law and wanted to act as his own council, he was denied his legal right to do so. The film lacked a certain something which a written bio I read of him did have, but I would still recommend this film for anyone interested in Lenny Bruce or the history of stage comedians.",1296518400,,634,4.474137931034483

1239930,4,B00000JZIM,"Except for the last paragraph the rest of this review was used to review the documentary ""Lenny Bruce: Without Tears"". The points made there apply here, for the most part, as well.

Okay, the average black male kid on the average ghetto city block knows, and knows without blinking, and knows from some seemingly unspoken source deep within his genetic structure that the cards are stacked against him. That the cops, the courts, or some other part of the ""justice"" system will, eventually, come knocking at the door or grab him off the street for something, usually dope. The average Latino male kid on the average barrio city now knows pretty much knows that same thing, again usually on some bogus drug charge. And nowadays even young black and Latina women are getting that same message coded into their psyches. What is not encoded is for a white, Jewish comic guy who has an off-beat sense of humor and has something to say, sometimes something profound to say, to face that same music, anytime. That, my friends, is the Lenny Bruce story in a nutshell and forms the theme for this commentary.

Really, I could leave the headline, taken from something Lenny Bruce said when he was in deep and surreal legal trouble back in the 1960s, and that would tell the tale here. Nevertheless the case of one off -beat comic who tried to ""go outside the envelope"" of the confines of safe, secure, no waves, post-World World II cultural expression is an object lesson for the rest of us. Being a little bit uppity, being a little too black or brown, or being a little too red could get you in more trouble than you can shake a stick at then, and now.

On viewing this documentary my first impression was ""what is all the fuss about?"" At the vantage point, forty or fifty years after the events, it is hard to see what the so-called moral police of the day got in a dither over in Bruce's work. On any given day you can hear more lewdness, lunacy, and sheer vulgarity on ""talk"" radio or television than Lenny ever uttered. That, however, is the point. Lenny was the point man, the trenchant social critic cum comedian who is honored now after the fact, but was not while the heat was on.

One of the highlights of this documentary is Lenny Bruce performing in various venues interspersed with ""talking head"" commentary by those who knew or interviewed him. The most interesting one is with jazz critic and social activist, Nat Hentoff, when Lenny is deep in trouble and has physically been ravished by his struggle. Kenneth Tynan, of 1950s San Francisco poetic fame, and Malcolm Muggridge add their somewhat bizarre two cents worth. As does Bruce fellow social critic, Mort Sahl.

Throwing out the above names and discussing the time frame of Bruce's troubles brings one final point. Was Lenny, like Kerouac, Ginsberg, Burroughs and Tynan, part of the 1950s ""beat"" generation? Certainly he was part of the avant guarde back door jazz scene and miles in front of any one else in the Milton Berle/Sid Caesar 1950s comedy world. One of the commentators noted that Bruce was primarily an entertainer, a man trying to make a living at what he did best. That seems right. But whether he was ""beat"" or not, he certainly pushed the envelop. And that is part of his legacy, and worthy of honor by us.

*****

The commercial movie ""Lenny"", starring Dustin Hoffman as Lenny, delves more into the personal side of Lenny's life, including his various affairs with women, especially the one leading up to his marriage(his wife here played by Valerie Perrine who seems perfect in this languid, strangely alluring stripper role), his jones, and his sinking down as a person under the weight of all those things and the long arm of the law. Hoffman is strongest when he digs deep into the legal imbroglio of Bruce's life and when he does some of his stand-up routines although anyone who has watched the Bruce documentary will note that it is almost impossible to mimic Bruce's mannerisms successfully. But a well done job, nevertheless.",1272067200,,4013,4.691761363636363
1239931,5,B00000JZIM,"It's funny living today in our hyper-sensitive ""PC"" world when saying one wrong word can get you condemned and in legal trouble and then to think back to Lenny Bruce and his whole message was to allow someone to express themselves as they are, in other words, don't take away their ""words"".

I didn't know much about Lenny Bruce when I first viewed this movie several years ago except that he was a comedian that said some cuss words and got into trouble for it. In that light, I really enjoyed the flow and rythm of this movie along with Dustin Hoffman's performance. Hoffman, as always, is a charismatic performer.

Maybe his portrayel of Mr. Bruce and his issues might not be totally accurate, but what he projected made the movie dynamic in it's own way. This double-sided DVD also contains English, Spanish, and French subtitles. There's a trailer of the movie which runs 3:22. One side of the disc is Widescreen and the other is Standard. The movie is in B&W and was released in 1974.",1264636800,,990,4.5875706214689265
1239932,4,B00000JZIM,"This is a great film about a comic nammed Lenny Bruce, not the comic, Lenny Bruce.

Watch films of the real Lenny: he is a big framed man, a hipster with a streem of consiousness mind and a airplane gunners mouth. His humor is scattalogical and wonders through the complexities of his mind before subtley arriving on point.

Fossee and Hoffman distil the comady and make Lenny seem like a crusading intellectual. The humor here is tight and to the point--excellent stand up--just not Lenny.

Also, all accounts I read say by 1966, Lenny was broken by junk and waiting to die. True, he spent a lot of legal fights, but  he spent more on heroin. Lenny, the film, makes it seem like he was broken more by his leagal battles than the drugs--that he was a crusading martyr ready to give all for the cause rather than a sad, broken victim of addiction.

Had Lenny lived into 1968 or 1969, he would have been in a whole new era, and a lot of his leagal issues would have taken care of themselves. Comics like Richard Pryor and George Carlin made Bruce seem tame by comparison, as did the counterculture about to explode when Lennt died.",1256947200,,1129,4.461165048543689
1239943,5,B00000JZIM,"I think this movie is great!  I have purchased a Baker's dozen for my friends.  I married Honey Bruce in 1984, here in Honolulu (husband number two).  I first had the pleasure of meeting Honey in 1974 in San Anselmo, California.  That summer, I was playing the bass guitar in a rock n' roll band for a fellow by the name of MiddleJohn.  Middle and I were living in a ranch house directly across the street from where Honey was making her home. I was sleeping in my 1971 Dodge Sportsman camper Van which I parked at the end of the street.
  One lazy afternoon, I had set up my amplifier on the front porch of the house.  Plugged in my bass guitar and was playing bass riffs. Honey was across the street doing her gardening.  She came over and introduced herself to me and showed me a photo of her daughter Kitty in TIME magazine.  Honey invired me over her house and into her livingroom.  We became very good friends.  Honey kept trying to get me to play bass along with a record of her's on her stereo - Alice Stuart.
  I dragged my amplifier into her livingroom and played the bass away.  I was pretty good.  That was thirty-five years ago.  As you can imagine I have many stories to share but time is limited.

1239944,5,B00000JZIM,"Hoffman fully inhabits the tortured genius of Lenny Bruce, a performer whose scathingly funny routines seem fairly tame by today's standards, but which, in the proper, conforming fifties and early sixties, offended the establishment sufficiently to prompt multiple arrests for obscenity. Valerie Perrine delivers vivid support as Bruce's cheesy stripper wife, Honey, as much a victim of the times--and drugs--as Bruce himself. ""Lenny"" is a rare non-musical triumph for director Fosse, who was Oscar-nominated, along with Hoffman and Perrine. This gritty picture still packs a wallop.",1183507200,2,583,5.790697674418604

There were times when i thought i was watching the real Lenny. The story of Lenny Bruce and his unfortunate fate is well know to most people and it's inpact on American society was an important one, tou can draw parallels to the more recent Bill Hicks and his infamous censorship with The Late Show.

The movie really captures the time in America and the attitude, it's shoot in black and white which i loved. Dustin is a have to say ,one more time, phenomenal as Lenny and the movie a must for anyone who love free speech and great thinkers like Lenny.

It really left me sad over the much to early passing of Lenny Bruce and the circumstance of which he died.

A superb film, i strongly recommend it to everyone",1178668800,,808,4.33112582781457

1239947,4,B00000JZIM,"Lenny is a fine film directed by the great Bob Fosse.

It stars Dustin Hoffman in a oscar nominated performance and the juicy Valerie Perrine.

The film captures the rise and fall of the great comic and how he broke down the barriers of free speech for all of the rest of the lesser comedians to take advantage of.

He had major substance problems and had a rocky relationship with a stripper as well as major troubles with the law due to his profane comic act and his drug addiction.

The acting is excellant with a well written script and Fosse provides just the right kind of atmosphere for the dark and seedy life that Bruce led whether it be in the nightclubs or in his sordid personal life.

Valerie Perrine alone is worth the price of admission because she reveals some of the most tasty ,plump, and PERFECT melons that i have ever seen as well as a shapely caboose.

MMMM.....Yummy....

Anyway, don't rent this movie if you're looking to brighten your day.

Rent it out and expect fine performances,engaging script dialogue, excellant detailled directing, and captivating self destruction.

4 Stars.

1239948,5,B00000JZIM,"One of the great movies at character depiction..Hoffman and the real Honey(wife) come of pretty real..Whether you loved or hated him he remains the true authentic man...He was funny at  unmasking morality as only a philosopher can..What he laid down remains his legacy.

where does his tragedy come from? well, the movie points to his wife,If indeed behind every great man stands a woman,then this movie can certainly debunk that myth..a little creative tension OK, but a return to heroin? Shot in realistic black and white,the stark depiction of his life will always serve as a reminder that he did more for free expression than most artists of his day...Coming at a time when the beats were melting into the hippies,Bruce was indeed a counterculture hero to many whose effect radically changed the way America and it's intelligentsia saw themselves..From the early days of Miles Davis music floating throughout the movie and his days in Jewish New York, Bruce's desire to transcend his safe origins and take risks fed into this need for constant reassurance and a sense of success in his days coming to terms with 1950's USA. The drug use and the infidelities were real yet somehow sympathy exists for artists such as Bruce later popularized by writers such as Norman Mailer and even in movies like Raging Bull where the hero takes a fall either through self delusion or the success thrown on them.

The personal insecurities were at times portrayed in the movie as an escape into hedonism but more often like a shot of morphine as an antidote to pain, whether self caused,real or imagined...Bruce came of age with his new found converts,the silent majority as it seems, behind him, his children remained and pushed him into the current cultural landscape of America..where he would be without them is a tough call ...criminal?madman?prophet?anarchist?pervert? he is beyond category (perhaps like us all) and that is why we can only get glimpses at anyone's biography whether written or on film.

His life fell apart and he self destructed. Always willing to tear down the veils of hypocritical morality...Lenny Bruce knew what is and what should be are two different things.

He played hard,defied the system,paid the price and goes down in history as a key cultural figure.

This is not a documentary nor a romantic opportunity at hero worship but a very realistic look at a man who was certainly one of the key figures that shaped popular culture whose effects

are still to be felt and was ahead of his time in his total stream of consciousness.

The DVD has 2 sides both wide and a standard screen version and serves a great historical purpose in understanding the era.",1136160000,2,2676,4.891832229580574
1239949,3,B00000JZIM,"My first exposure to the world of Lenny Bruce was the Broadway show, Lenny.  The film is (loosely) based on the play, which rather faithfully followed the life of Lenny Bruce (more or less) and told his story using entirely his own words. In the stage version, Lenny was played by Cliff Gorman, whose best known role was that of the wildly effeminate character Emory in both the film and original stage productions of Mart Crowley's play the Boys in the Band.  At the time, I ran out and purchased everything I could find on Lenny Bruce, because Cliff Gorman was that funny.  I laughed so hard in the theatre, I thought I'd die, and had trouble deciding what was more important, Lenny Bruce's status as one of the funniest comedians who ever lived, or the amazing social commentary woven throughout his routines. At the time, I remember thinking that Lenny Bruce was more of a philosopher or even a potential cult religious leader than a comedian. He had a knack of exposing hypocrisy, be it in politics, organized religion, race relations or whatever. I was convinced, at the tender age of 18, that Lenny Bruce had the keys, if not the answers, to all of the world's problems.

I went out and purchased the cast album of the Broadway show, which consisted of a 2 LP recording of a complete live performance of the play.  I spent hours comparing Cliff Gorman to the real Lenny Bruce, and each time I listened to either, I memorized one of Lenny's hysterically funny bits. When I listened to records of the real Lenny Bruce, I marveled at how perfectly Cliff Gorman had reproduced his persona.  The rapid-fire delivery, the inflection, even the tonal quality of his voice and the exact pauses in his speech were there.  It was like Lenny Bruce had been reincarnated as Cliff Gorman.  I had trouble deciding if this was great acting or just a good impersonation, and in the end decided it didn't matter, for the material in Lenny seemed to capture the real Lenny Bruce.  That was good enough for me.

When the film was announced, and I'd heard that Dustin Hoffman had been chosen to play Lenny, I was thrilled.  As a fan of Mr. Hoffman, I was sure he could do great justice to both the man and the material.  By the time the picture was completed, I had learned almost as much about Lenny Bruce's life as I ever would, and was familiar with probably 80% of his most famous routines.  The Masked Man, Christ and Moses, Las Vegas Tits and Ass, Airplane Glue, Ike and Nixon, Jackie Kennedy - I knew a lot of these by heart.  Some of them I memorized cold, and found that when people mentioned his name at parties or family gatherings, and someone invariably asked who he was, rather than explain his life or what he died of, all I had to do was recite one of his bits.  I never had a single person who was new to his material that didn't pronounce him awesome (as the kids say nowadays) on the spot.

I don't remember what film I was watching (it was 31 years ago) when I first saw a trailer for the film, but as soon as I saw a clip of Dustin Hoffman as Lenny I knew something was wrong.  I had a sinking feeling that I wasn't going to like the movie bio of what was now my favorite comedian, but I went to see it anyway, as soon as it opened, hoping my gut instinct was wrong.  The cinematography was stunning.  The direction was first rate.  The story was fairly faithful to the life and spirit of Lenny Bruce, and Dustin Hoffman did as good an acting job as I'd ever seen.  All of the bits were there, and so was a fairly faithful rendering of his professional life.  So what was the problem?  The problem was simply that Dustin wasn't funny.  Those were Lenny Bruce's words and Lenny Bruce's life, but the jokes fell flat.  I came to the conclusion that no matter how skilled he is as an actor, Dustin Hoffman is no comedian.  He certainly was no Lenny Bruce.  Where was the lightning timing I was used to from the Cliff Gorman and Lenny Bruce recordings?  Mr. Hoffman seemed very unsure of his material, and delivered all the routines at what seemed like half-speed.  It was almost like he was a 45 RPM record being played at 33 1/3.  I wanted to reach into his mouth and pull the words out, and shout at the screen, ""You've got it all wrong!  This is too somber and too slow and too...unfunny to be Lenny Bruce"".  Worse, Mr. Hoffman had the annoying habit (which Lenny never did) of laughing at his own jokes.  Not loud guffaws mind you, just chuckles.  Constant chuckles, almost to himself, which left me with the impression that he thought that he was the only one who got the material.

I bought the VHS when it came out several years later and watched it faithfully, hoping that as an older and wiser person, maybe I would find things in Mr. Hoffman's performance that I missed in 1974.  I wanted it to click.  No such luck.  I then dutifully purchased the DVD, as I have always purchased ""new"" Lenny Bruce recording or, lately videos, never tiring of his delivery or his message.  Again, I hoped that time had been kind to the portrayal I had so looked forward to in 1974.  But I screened it recently, and the film still leaves me cold, despite the best of intentions, the flawless direction and the great production values.  Icon, philosopher, cult leader or genius, if nothing else, Lenny Bruce was funny.  And Dustin Hoffman was not.",1133740800,4,5343,4.426816786079836
1239950,3,B00000JZIM,"Bob Fosse was an amazing talent, and there is much to love about this movie from a cinematic and stylistic standpoint. As a history of Lenny Bruce, however, the picture is selective and over-dramatized. As, I suppose, any biopic has to be, but the selectiveness here seems imbalanced and the dramatization unnecessary. It's a decent introduction to the subject of Lenny Bruce, just don't take it as the whole and gospel truth. And Hoffman--amazingly gifted and one of my favorite actors though he may be--simply does not communicate the live presence that this man had.

Buy a few Lenny CD's (I would recommend Carnegie Hall and the Curran Theater), watch the documentary ""Swear to Tell the Truth,"" watch ""Lenny Bruce Without Tears,"" and if you really wanna get into the minutae then read the book ""The Trials of Lenny Bruce"" by Ronald Collins and David Skover. Then you'll begin to get the real picture of a brilliant, flawed, hilarious man and his relevance to the First Amendment and the social revolution of the 60's and 70's. Lenny was history.

1239951,5,B00000JZIM,"A serious, honest bio-pic of the self-destructive, though highly influential, social comic Lenny Bruce. Using the device of taping interviews with those who knew him (especially with his wife, Honey, played by Valerie Perrine), the movie recounts Bruce's life in chronological order, with the interviews interspliced to make the film look like a ""story."" Dustin Hoffman, a versitile actor ever willing to take on ""unusual"" roles at this time, is Lenny, and he does an excellent job. Filmed by Bob Fosse in stunning b&w; the movie doesn't try to glorify Bruce in any way. As a piece of film making, it's terrific. Definitely worth a watch.",1128729600,,638,5.028301886792453
1239962,3,B00000JZIM,"Finally saw this film on Sundance Channel last night. I was a kid when it came out and had always wanted to see it. I was encouraged by all the five-star reviews I'd seen in other places, but I have to say, Perrine is the best thing in this movie--I mean, she is absolutely superb. There is an openness and honesty to her performance that makes her a delight to watch, even in the most disturbing scenes. But Hoffman? Although I grew up hearing about the *legacy* of Lenny Bruce, I have only a passing familiarity with his stage persona. Yet I never really felt like I was watching anyone but Dustin Hoffman the whole film. Don't get me wrong: I think some of Hoffman's movies are stellar and even underrated (""Little Big Man,"" for one). But ""Lenny"" is not such an example.

The cinematography *is* beautiful, but I felt like Fosse was trying to cram too much into it. (Scenes unfold during Hoffman's--I mean, Bruce's--stage act that aren't always fleshed out and simply distract.) I would recommend this if you're interested in the history of comedy, but Dustin Hoffman is NOT the reason to watch it!",1127520000,4,1101,4.588832487309645

1239964,4,B00000JZIM,"This excellent portrayal of 60's comic icon Lenny Bruce is a tour de force for Dustin Hoffman even if the story is a little whitewashed. Fosse stays safe in presenting Lenny's persecution as being based on the profanity issue. In fact, the real issue was Lenny's condemnation of the Catholic Church which struck 60's America across the face with its bare contempt. Speaking against the Church wasn't prosecutable, but the profanity laws were still on the books at that time. Like Al Capone, the law figured out a way to bust Lenny. All in all, a very enjoyable film, especially for those unfamiliar with Lenny, who in the end got crucified for today's comics.",1105574400,3,659,4.7894736842105265
1239965,5,B00000JZIM,"I went into this film knowing nothing about the comic Lenny Bruce, and after watching this film I have already added two of his CDs to my Wish List.  I am eager to hear more, to listen to his words, and be intrigued by how his thoughts are still relevant in today's society.  This was a beautiful film made in 1974.  The decision by director Bob Fosse to film it completely in black and white was brilliant.  Hoffman and Perrine's chemistry is brilliant as well as their performances.  The power of this man is vividly demonstrated through this film, leaving you with questions answered as well as a desire to hear more.  This was such a captivating feature.  From the opening sequence of words spewing from a mouth to the final shot of Lenny Bruce, I was glued to my seat.

To begin, the cinematography was better than most feature films.  Fosse knew what he was doing and did it with the greatest of ease.  His choice to film completely in black and white really helped me hear the words that Bruce spoke instead of just being involved in the colors that surrounded him.  The black and white feature gave Hoffman the ability to create a human from his character and take us away from Hoffman and into the mind of comic Lenny Bruce.  The shots that Fosse used also assisted with building this compelling story.  Every shot is important in this film, and Fosse does a great job of demonstrating and explaining the ""why"" and ""where"" of a scene.  This was his first and only nonmusical, and he was triumphant.  The way that the story works in a pseudo-documentary style was impeccable.  While you are never quite told who the person is behind the camera, you do get that raw emotion from the actors as if you were watching a real documentary.  There was just so much emotion that Fosse pulled from his troupe in this film that you could only watch in amazement.  It also left the door open to the question of who is behind the camera.  With the words that Bruce said nightly in his show, I couldn't help but think of the possibility of government conspiracy.  Maybe I am way off, but there was that aura of ""cover-up"" throughout this film.  Even the final sequence gives off that sense.

BAM - Powerful cinematography is right in front of you, but whom do we have in the center of the camera?  None other than a very young and fresh Dustin Hoffman.  This film really showcased his talents.  While he had several films before this one that brought him into the spotlight, I thought that he went above and beyond for this film.  He really transformed himself into the character.  Some of my favorite moments with Hoffman in Lenny was when he thinks about the nurse the first time, when Honey calls asking for money, and when he asks the Judge to sentence him now instead of going through the trial.  The vision of defeat was spectacular.  You see in this film why Hoffman is considered one of the greats of Hollywood.  Valerie Perrine, also a young actress at the time, was immaculate.  Her portrayal of Honey needs to go in the history books.  Actresses today could take a moment or two to learn from this dramatic actress.  These two actors really brought this film together.  They took you deep into the life of this radical thinker and kept you nestled deeply inside of him.  They shined greatly, and the Academy saw it too!

BAM - Cinematography, BAM - award winning acting, what can be the final BAM?  How about Lenny Bruce?  Born well after his death, I had never even heard of the man, but the words that I witnessed from this film from his mouth shocked me.  Not so much because of the shock value that surrounded them, but just how relevant his work is still today.  As homosexuality becomes a staple in our community and society, Lenny's comments on the teachers in this film seemed like topics we are still talking about today.  He was way ahead of his time, and I think that is why people feared him.  Living with an English teacher, I am constantly involved with the English language, but I am also shown information about those that have no interest because they do not see how it relates to ""real"" life.  I am also aware of how little respect English gets as daily we hear of schools cutting back on their Literature studies to help support their sports program, or how the first way to cut back spending is to close libraries.  These are sad days that we live in, and if only people could see how powerful words can be in defending yourself and explaining the world, I think we would see a rebirth.  If I had the option to fight with a loaded gun or an aggressive dictionary, I think you can see which I would choose.  Lenny Bruce did no harm to anyone, he spoke his mind, and for that he was convicted.  What a sad day for America.

Valerie Perrine, as Honey, his stripper wife is gorgeous.  His performance, judged as obscene, would be fairly tame today (but remember, this was the '60's).  The authorities used this as a pretext to shut him up (much like they'd use the ""Patriot Act"" today) because his political comments hit too close to home.

Valerie Perrine never reached the highest peak as actress with this breathtaking performance. Her role deserved her the Prize as best actress in 1975 in the Cannes International Film Festival.

1239971,4,B00000JZIM,"Dustin Hoffman is Lenny Bruce - controversial loudmouth, frequent defendant and doomed icon.  By now, we all know that Lenny Bruce was famous for making people laugh at hearing things they didn't want to hear (as long as they weren't middle-aged white men involved in law enforcement).  Bruce earned the adoration of fans even as his routines and addictions brought him into repeated contact with the police.  Surprisingly, despite his eager exploration at the dark side of everything, Bruce manages to achieve some real happiness - finding love with a similarly off-center stripper (a very pre-""Can't Stop the Music"" Valerie Perrine), and even triumphing (eventually) in one of his prosecutions.
The film is presented in verite black and white, and tells the story of Bruce through interviews with the people who knew him - Perrine, his lawyers, his promoters and agents.  The light is low, hinting of the gloomy circumstances that have made the story of Bruce's life a subject of such interest.  Most of the characters looks as if they were interviewed in dark closets or on darkened stages.  The film slyly suggests we can recognize the villains and heroes of Bruce's story according to how grieved they are in reliving his tortured life.  By the end, Bruce was stretched too thin by additional brushes with the law and problems both medical and financial.
This flick is actually full of surprises.  For one thing, we've got the fragility of Bruce's heroic faade.  Though resolute in the face of the establishment on stage, Lenny seems to come apart when facing obscenity charges.  Bruce spoke to an America full of people ready to go to jail to speak their mind on civil rights or against the war, but Dustin Hoffman's Lenny is terrified of going to prison.  Facing certain conviction, he becomes snippy - his routines degenerate into monologues about his trials.  Another surprise is Bruce's feelings about obscenity.  Though he knows he's pushing the envelope, Hoffman's Bruce doesn't think himself obscene, and takes it personally when others describe him that way (especially during his trials when police officers' testimony essentially requires that they give their version of his act - you're spoiling the act! He yells at them).  Hoffman's Bruce isn't looking to fight for the right to be obscene - merely to stretch the bounds of what's acceptable; he struggles for a chance to perform his routine for the court, knowing he can prove that he's not obscene.  In the end, all is futile, and the law takes away the one thing Bruce can't afford to lose - his words.
Though showing many faces of Lenny Bruce, the flick seems to be missing Bruce's biggest target: himself Bob Fosse directed both this and his own semi-autobiographical ""All That Jazz"".  While you can see that both films share a common vision, self disparagement seems something Fosse saves for the latter film (""Jazz"" seemed to have a double-helping of it; now we know where it came from).  The film never has Bruce question his own substance abuse problems which wrecked his health and brought him further closer to prison.  Neither does the later Bruce - the one closer to the end - even seem to acknowledge those he loved, those he must have known would feel the most pain when he was gone.  Fosse seems so resolute to show how weak and non-iconic Lenny Bruce really was that he misses the chance to show how human he could have been.",1042588800,3,3411,4.860103626943006
