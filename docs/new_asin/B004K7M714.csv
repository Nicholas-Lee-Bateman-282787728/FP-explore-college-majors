8432548,5,B004K7M714,I caught a little on this when it was on showtime. So I bought the dvd... he is sooo funny and I really think ol' Tom needs a little less caffeine in his diet though hahaha. Buy it! If not for anything else then hearing a new view on the Rosanne singing the National Anthem.,1331769600,,274,4.0

Well, it's not typical stand-up...mostly just Tom telling stories about himself, and he's had a crazy enough life that there's a lot of material there.  Funny stuff.",1317081600,,315,4.589285714285714
