4661410,5,B005DR64HS,"This is probably one of my favorite reverse harem animes along with Ouran High School host club.

The story is about the main character Kahoko Hino who attends a school that is known for splitting the school in two: the normal students and the special musical students (think rich/smart kids). Both schools don't get along at all given how they're on different levels. Kahoko ends up participating in the musical competition all because she is able to see a little fairy Lili who ends up giving her a magic violin that will allow her to play music without even practicing. He then enters her in the competition and expects her to do well.

This is where she starts meeting the boys of her her harem that are all entering the competition for different reasons. The series goes on with Kahoko befriending them and starting to understand the joys of music. This anime is known for actually giving facts about music numbers, composers and the types of songs played in accurate detail so if you're not an expert in music like me, then you'll be learning something watching this anime.

I think the sad thing about the anime is how the last two guys of the harem Kaji and Kariya are demoted to extra (especially the latter who is only there to insult Kahoko and leave) but that's mainly because the anime didn't get a second season to flush the two out.

The characters that are not kicked out of the harem are well developed in such a short amount of time. Alas, some characters don't get enough development given how the anime ends halfway near the end of the manga such as Len and Yunoki. I would easily say that Kazuki and Fuyumi (the other girl participating in the tournament and I count her in the harem given her obvious crush on Kahoko) got the most development with what the anime has to offer...and I admit I kind of leaned toward Kahoko ending up with Kazuki (good thing I didn't read the manga or I would be disappointed) given how much he influences her the most in the anime (I feel like this given how the other guys didn't seem to help Kahoko that much except Tsuchira (who already acts as her best friend anyway given how he's the first one she meets). But that's me being bias. You won't be disappointed with this anime especially since it has one of the best soundtracks out there from real musicians to the anime themes.",1361750400,,2335,4.513002364066194
4661411,5,B005DR64HS,I love having complete collections not only does it save more space on your book case but it also has all the episodes that you can watch again and again. This anime had pretty artwork and i love the plot just wish they made more of this anime.,1360281600,,244,4.104166666666667
4661412,5,B005DR64HS,"love the item, glad I purchesed it would order again. fast and reliable service and it was excatly what i needed",1354147200,,112,4.380952380952381
4661413,5,B005DR64HS,"Five stars is not enough. Corda is my favorite anime, and manga too. (Buy the manga from Shojo Beat!!) I like the manga a bit more, but the anime does have the advantage of being able to hear music- Corda is all about classical music! It also has themes of love, friendship, and trying your best. I really love the characters and each one is special in their own way. It's great to watch (or read) this magical, musical storyline and see how these themes shape the characters' experiences. It's a really sweet, funny, cute, beautiful shojo anime and I hope you watch it, and buy the manga as well. (Yuki Kure's art is very pretty)",1348358400,,630,4.439655172413793
4661414,5,B005DR64HS,"This is a good anime to watch. Does not have a lot of romance, mostly of you like music, for if mainly focuses on music. There is some chemistry between the characters, so overall a good one to watch",1331078400,,199,4.128205128205129
4661415,5,B005DR64HS,"*Just as a note and disclaimer: I did not purchase the ""Complete Collection"" set, but instead purchased ""Collection 1"" and ""Collection 2"" (meaning I bought the 2 DVD cases instead of the single DVD case).  However, since I've seen the show in it's entirety, I thought it would be a little helpful to at least post my impressions of the show itself.  Besides, the studio, distributor/provider of the ""Complete Collection"" is the same exact one as that of ""Collection 1"" and ""Collection 2""...they just provided two different ways to purchase it""

I assure you, I will not give plot spoilers :-)

FOR THE PARENTS: First, allow me to start with content issues since parents may or may not be looking for a new film for their young sons or daughters, and such is a concern for them...especially with a lot of anime, you don't always know what you are getting.  There is no fanservice or provocative material (visually or otherwise), there is no foul language neither, there is nothing about conspiracies and darker topics...it really is a film more about music and relationships, and friends...but especially music.

MOVING ON:
  This show takes place in a school that happens to have a strong performing arts emphasis.  In fact, the school is divided into two sides (or form of studies I should say): the General Studies students, and the Music Students.  One day, because of peculiar events beyond her control, a General Studies student finds herself competing in a music festival in which MOST of her competitors are seasoned Music Students.  And the fun begins...naturally :-)

This show is a much lighter fare than, say, ""Nodame Cantabile (anime)"", ""Mr. Holland's Opus"", and ""Beethoven Virus"".  But it really shines in it's own unique way, and definitely adds much to the musical dialogue...both to educators and musicians.  To be honest, the setup really mimics a genre of anime called ""reverse harem"" (one girl with tons of guys after her favor), but the thing is, it is kind of a mistake and misleading to assume it as that (which was good for me, because I don't care much for the ""harem"" genre).  The only reason I overstepped my ""initial fears"" about it being a ""harem"" show  was because of it's realistic, yet magical approach to music and musical studies which remained a prominent theme through out...albeit the key theme.  My instincts were spot on this time, and I finished it.  Good thing, too, because this was one more excellent music title for my ""library"" and one more musical inspiration.

As a musician, it really gave me much to think about: Issues about practicing, endurance, creativity, career and love for it.  It showed me both the sadness of lost opportunities and brilliant rebirths.  But some of the biggest things I gleaned from this exceptional series is how a single person learning to love music can influence those around.  How a single person can bring out the best in people (and musicians) and remind them why they do what they do.  It was especially phenomenal how the lead character made classical music relevant and very intimate for herself...how she began to understand many of the composers and/or musical content through experiences in her own life.  She even inspired me to continue with the viola, even though other instruments were easier (though I must say, she's a much, much faster learner than I am haha).  So, is there romance? Definitely, but it's an inspiring romance of music that can warm the hearts of all who watch...and a welcome freshness :-)",1327017600,8,3500,4.871621621621622
4661416,5,B005DR64HS,"Daughter wanted it, got it and she loves it. She is so in to this its almost addicting. She did not know the collection was available until searching amazon. Great find.",1324771200,,169,4.483870967741935
4661417,4,B005DR64HS,"This story tells how Hino, a general studies high school girl in the general studies curriculum, receives a magical gift after saving a ""music fairy"" at school.  This magical violin connects her heart's feelings directly to how well it plays, without needing any practice with bow or fingering.  She rapidly learns to play more and more beautifully as her heart becomes more focused on her new-found love of music performance and as she begins participating in the music curriculum she meets several boys in very natural ways.

As an amateur musician who happened to attend a college with a large number of music majors the music students were very authentic to me; the artistic quirks and variety of motivations and goals evoked many pleasant memories and I suspect viewers of this show would truly enjoy the music school background of the otherwise typical high school slice of life plus a bit of romance.

The magical aspect of this tale, though at first seeming a mere plot contrivance to get her to meet a group of interesting characters, turns out to be significant throughout the story.  Unlike many other stories add some magical element and then throw in more whenever convenient to the plot, this story remains self-consistent throughout and I believe ends up showing great respect for musicians that don't possess magical instruments but instead have to practice endlessly to master their craft.

Also unlike many harem and reverse harem tales, Hino is not bland nor is she unchanged by the events of the story; there is definite growth of her as a person along with several of her new musician friends.

As one might expect, many beautiful classical pieces are included in the soundtrack and they are played superbly.

Animation is adequate; characters are easily distinguished, although the bizarre hair colors typical of anime are present in full measure.  A few of the music performances are fully animated, though standard shortcuts are used throughout.

There is no objectionable content at all, although adult themes are addressed during several family conflicts and small children would likely find little of interest in the story itself.

All in all a worthwhile story suitable for older children on up; highly recommended.",1318809600,8,2243,5.067934782608695
8467323,5,B005DR64HS,I have watched this series a thousand times .  It is amazing and all the pieces played are  enchanting.  Highly recommend it.,1501113600,,125,4.590909090909091

8467325,5,B005DR64HS,I heard about this anime long time ago. The artwork and story is good. The episode bite short. There is another Anime deal with same type of music. Which is bite better then this one. I don't recall the name but it's good. It is worth seeing. It has both anime and live action.,1449705600,,277,4.148148148148148

8467329,4,B005DR64HS,"Love, love, LOVE this anime.  Okay, it's not perfect.  The manga is more complete and builds the relationships between Kahoko and the different boys better.  But this is still definitely worth a view as a lighthearted anime suitable for pre-teens and up.

Now to my complaints, which have to do with the release itself and not the content.  This series comes with all four discs stacked right on top of each other.  Not with their own individual slot.  Not just merely overlapping.  This makes handling the discs very clumsy and I'm going to invest in some DVD jewel cases one of these days so I don't have to deal with this madness.  Also, the subtitles have some typos.  They don't detract too much but they could have easily been fixed by a proofreader.  All in all, still worth the investment though.",1408665600,,804,4.631205673758865
8467330,4,B005DR64HS,"bought this one because i so love this anime
but sadly i had to try out every possible device before i finaly found one that supported the 'region' of this dvd
(happened a few times already with dvds i bought in my country myself, so no big problem)

the box was also damaged a tiny bit during transport, but since those are just minor problems i don't mind
the dvds weren't damaged so i'm glad
4/5 because i'm so happy for having this dvd finaly ^.^",1397952000,,450,4.232558139534884
8467331,3,B005DR64HS,"I really liked this anime. At the beginning I was reminded of Princess Tutu for some reason, but with music rather than ballet. The characters were interesting and the art was beautiful.

I think that several of the characters needed to be fleshed out more. Pretty boys may be nice but some personal time with them would have helped. My biggest disappointment is that the ending is noticeably incomplete. We don't know who she ends up with from her harem. There is a bonus episode as well and it intentionally ends with the same feeling. I found this VERY annoying after purchase to feel as if the story was left hanging. Where Ouran Host was able to hurry an ending at the last moment of the anime, based on the fact we knew who the characters would end up with, that's not the case here, and without reading the manga I cannot tell if it's intentional or not.

 I had the feeling this was an adaptation so looked it up and found the series here on Amazon so intend to read it. My library doesn't have it, so it will have to wait until I can afford to purchase the series (but I liked the show enough to do so). Since my main problem was the lack of ending, the manga should tie that up, and leave me hopefully enjoying my anime more the next time I watch it.

 I recommend watching it, but I would view it first for free on HULU and see how you like it. The price for purchase on Amazon is okay but this is a subtitled series, not dubbed, and think it could be cheaper. Especially when it's available elsewhere at no charge.",1378598400,,1526,4.26643598615917
8467332,5,B005DR64HS,"There are two kinds of students at Seiso Academy: those enrolled in the music curriculum and those enrolled in general studies. Students in general studies are looked down on by most music students. Kahoko Hino, just happens to be a general studies student.

Kahoko has never played any musical instrument until she meets a fairy named, Lili. He decides to give a magic violin to Kohoko. Soon after she starts playing, the school recognizes her ""talent."" The school participates in a musical competition every year that usually chooses a group of highly talented music curriculum students. This year it includes Kohoko. Though nervous, she joins the other chosen students, most of which are good-looking boys. They slowly get to know each other while doing what they love, playing music that touches people's hearts. Kokoho finds out she really enjoys playing the violin. But is playing a magic violin cheating? Are her friends becoming suspicious of her musical skills? And will there be some romance between her and a some of her handsome friends?

I liked this anime. It can be a little slow paced in parts, but it has great, lovable characters. The music is sweet and gentle. I really wished they would have finished the second season. It was cancelled after a few episodes. I'm planning on reading the manga to find out what happens. But I recommend watching it too.",1373155200,,1371,4.905172413793103
