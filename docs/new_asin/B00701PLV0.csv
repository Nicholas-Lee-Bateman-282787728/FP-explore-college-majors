8507411,1,B00701PLV0,"Very wealthy bedridden elderly man, who is suppose to be dying but at the end of the movie looks pretty healthy, is trying to find a long lost girl friend that his conscience goaded him into finding the girl he dissed. So he hires an incompetent sleeze bag, quasi-investigator, to find her. The investigator pays an equally incompetent boat owner to go to an island in search of her where he finds a half dozen, also incompetent, grandmother types living as farmers. The remainder of the movie is the childish interplay between the women, the detective and some passenger that was also on the boat who does pretty much nothing the whole movie.

Poor acting; stupid dialogue; pointless script unless you like '30s slapstick and elderly women acting senile; lots of inconsistencies such as supposedly a small remote island but it has nice houses, electricity and paved roads.
