I always felt like they were not marketed as the New Orleans Rock and Roll band they were, and that the glam rock/hair band media impression was way off.",1224979200,6,291,4.471698113207547

I would like to have seen a live performance of (Why). There is footage of that song floating on youtube. This song is on the Zebra IV CD. Dont have it, get it. Its GOOD to.

3067930,5,B0011U525G,"Looking forward to seeing this DVD.  Zebra was always ""Top Notch"" when it came to performing. It seems we all grew up with these guys. Back in the late 70's early 80's, in Houma, Louisiana. We saw them grow from performing in High School gyms for CYO dances, to big arenas like the Louisiana Superdome. Going from an opening act, to closing down and stealing the show. Had the chance of meeting Randy Jackson (Wow!) and he was a very humbled and down to earth musician...something extraordinarily out of the ordinary! Good job guys...Keep the music coming!",1209254400,7,556,4.731958762886598

3067932,5,B0011U525G,"While working as the House Sound Engineer at ""The Chance"" in Poughkeepsie NY 1988 - 1991. I had the pleasure of doing stage monitors for most of the acts that came thru. From Huey Lewis to Skid Row.

I have to say when the Zebra guys came thru (I think 3 times) they were one of the most together acts I have ever dealt with. The gear was fast and very tight. Felix's Keyboard stand was the first thing off the truck and when you saw it knew who was in town. The FOH guy also did a great job as well. His delay work was spot on. Timed perfect and never to strong. He never beat up my house rig. Just got the best out of it and made the whole day/show a great time for everyone.

The band were true pros. Focused, precise and human.
Some of the other acts... Well you know!

This DVD brought me right back to then. The stage gear is quite simpler now. A smart move in today's world. Although Randy, I kinda miss the BC Rich. But that LP Custom looks about as broken in as I ever seen. And I wonder if Felix misses the ""Monster Rig"". One keyboard and a SVT? Who woulda thunk it?
And Guy, I think he could make wooden spoons, two pillows and a phonebook sound good!

Any way...  The DVD is a must have. The band is still quite amazing.

Thanks fellas! 30 more!!!!",1207872000,6,1260,4.040160642570281
3067933,5,B0011U525G,"This DVD is an absolute treasure.  I have been waiting for a performance DVD from these guys for a long time and I am happy to say it was worth the wait.

I used to see Zebra in Port Chester, NY at a place called Detroit before they were every signed to a record deal.  I was barely old enough to get in and these guys blew me away.  Just regular friendly guys, they would mingle in the audience between sets.  A true power trio, all three are amazing musicians.  They used to play a ton of Zeppelin covers but I loved it most when they would play their originals.

This DVD is like a trip through memory lane for me, but besides that these guys are as sharp and on top of their game as they were 30 years ago.  Here's the live performances that are on this DVD:

As I Said Before
Wait Until The Summer's Gone
Light Of My Love
K.K. Is Hiding
When You Get There
The La La Song
Bears
But No More
One More Chance
Tell Me What You Want
Arabian Nights
My Life Has Changed
No Tellin' Lies
Who's Behind The Door
Free
Take Your fingers From My Hair

Great interviews especially with Randy.  My only complaint is that there are interviews interspersed between the songs with no option to play without them although you can just skip through.  I have found myself watching this over and over and have some new favorite songs that I never heard before.

If you have ever seen these guys live buy the DVD it will be just like you remembered them.  If you never saw them live, this is your chance.

Enjoy!",1207612800,12,1492,4.1678321678321675

3067935,5,B0011U525G,Finally got around of ordering the DVD that was on my wishlist for years. It's great stuff but like some others have mentioned it should have separated the interviews from the live performances. Using bits and pieces during the interviews would have been great but then should've included the full live show(s) as well. That aside what an amazing band and great bunch of guys. Their live performances are stellar and I wish I could see them live.

Interviews and two live shows (an acoustic Long Island, NY show and an even better electric show from the House of Blues in New Orleans...the majority of it!) put together to add up to, basically a two hour documentary on the band. It's the original three guys and you get a chance to know them better, hear their voices, get an idea of their personalities and what they bring to the band,and best of all, to see them play live, which wasn't always an easy show to catch back in the day, especially outside of their two bases of the New York and New Orleans areas. If you want to catch Zebra live and you haven't yet or maybe you have and want to relive the experience, this is the DVD you want. Great stuff from an underrated/fairly unknown band of the 1980's. Randy Jackson's guitar playing is epic!! As an aside, I got a chance, a few years back, to catch Randy solo singing and playing his twelve string acoustic and it was a virtual jukebox of the 60's and 70's music that he grew up on and was inspired by...lots of Zeppelin and Beatles, with some Elton John and Rush thrown in for good measure. And, of course the great Zebra originals that we all know. If you get a chance to see him, do so and pick up his tribute to the Beatles album while you're at it!!

8242346,4,B0011U525G,"Interesting background story about band and how they got a little bit of fame. Big question was always why they never got the success like Rush or Zeppelin. Saw them in 87 in a bar called Club 19 in Clearwater, Fla. and they were (and are) a great live band. Overall, I think the DVD is great for the live feel of Zebra the only complaint I have personally is no 3. V material.  Zebra please make another studio album it's been too long.",1468454400,2,437,4.2023809523809526

8242348,5,B0011U525G,"It's clear that a lot of love went into this DVD, which consists of a history and not quite enough concert footage of perhaps the best pure rock band to come out of New Orleans.  Having seen them 25+ times in the late 80s, I admit this DVD is also a nostalgic trip for me.  Still, these guys have always been an incredible live band, and I sure wish they could have made it to full-blown stardom. If you like Zeppelin, Rush, have any connection to New Orleans or Long Island, or simply want to see a really great power trio, with an insanely accomplished and powerful drummer, pick up this DVD.  I can't imagine you'll be disappointed.",1455235200,,635,4.364406779661017
8242349,5,B0011U525G,This tells their story real well and includes many live performances that were quite good.  They truly deserved better.,1443312000,,119,5.2631578947368425
8242350,5,B0011U525G,"This concert exceeded my expectations.  I love their 1st album, and, most of it is highlighted in this concert.  I was worried that after all these years that the vocals would be a bit off, this was not the case.  I am thrilled to have Zebra in my collection...A+++",1440028800,,265,4.36734693877551
8242351,4,B0011U525G,"I had the pleasure of seeing Zebra in a small venue in the late 80's. It was a great show and this one brought back many memories.  These guys are excellent musicians and , from the interviews, seem like very nice people.  The band is in great form.  I really like the acoustic songs.  Randy's voice is in great shape.  Guy is an amazing drummer.  Anyone who doubts this just needs to watch his solo.  That was one of the high points I remember from the late 80's show.  Felix is great on both bass and keyboards.  The sound is quite dense coming from a 3 piece band.  Fans of Zebra need to add this to their collection.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that many interview spots are stuck in between songs during the show.  I've never met any concert DVD fan who likes this.  Put the interviews in a separate spot and this is a 5 star product.  The show is definitely worth 5 stars.",1433376000,,901,4.132947976878612
