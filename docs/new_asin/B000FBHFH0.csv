8120273,5,B000FBHFH0,For an Art Teacher this set is invaluable. When I need to a substitute with no experience in Art I plan these excellently acted and scripted DVDs into the lesson plans for my students. The students enjoy the  exposure to the stories about these artists and gain a lot of background in how Art is made and the problems that need to be solved to generate it. I bought the VHS versions long ago and now I invested in the DVDs.,1436572800,,423,4.222222222222222
8120274,5,B000FBHFH0,"How do you introduce the life of various artist to younger students, especially since so many of them lived complicated and immoral lives? This series is a wonderful way to introduce the kids to the lives of five artists and the challenges each faced. Shot on location the sets and costumes are well done. The students enjoy the historical-fictional scripts and humor. I enjoy being able to share their lives without fear of exposing them to inappropriate details.",1395187200,5,464,4.961538461538462
8120275,5,B000FBHFH0,"Art students K-12, LOVE these and they are much better suited to teens than those mind-numbing art documentaries that even put me to sleep. Students had much better retention of art history watching these than anything I've ever presented.

Degas DVD is STUNNING-great grouchy character. I stopped it in the middle and had loud groans of disappointment until the next class. Monet is a hoot dodging creditors. Only sleeper was the sixth DVD, Winslow Homer. So slow paced, my high school students, quit watching and started doodling (or sleeping). Also had a swear word which surprised me because none of the others did, so didn't show to younger kids.

All in all a wonderful collection! I wore out five of the six VHS tapes and reordered the set in DVD's.",1378080000,6,756,4.8076923076923075
8120276,5,B000FBHFH0,This is a great way to get children to see the artist as real people.  It opens up discussion and gives them something to use as a base for learning.  I like the way they have children in the videos that are the age of the upper middle school students I show this to.  It helps them relate.  I want more!  How about it HBO?,1362182400,,323,3.9076923076923076
8120277,5,B000FBHFH0,"I just recently received the Artists' Specials DVD Collectors Set.  I teach art in a home school co-op and I was looking for some biographies which were appropriate for high school students.  I've just recently watched two of the videos and they are quite good.  In fact, after the one on Rembrandt, I did some research on his life and the information portrayed in the video was totally accurate.  My hats off to this company.  I would recommend these for any classroom or home school setting.",1192147200,19,493,4.686046511627907
8120278,4,B000FBHFH0,These videos have been a great teaching tool.  They have spurred the interests of my daughters (ages 6 and 8)in these artists -- paving the way for more indepth learning.,1190160000,10,170,4.666666666666667
8120279,5,B000FBHFH0,"These short movies, 45 minutes or so, are wonderful introduction to a few of the famous, most viewed artists of another age.  They make the artist into more than just a picture in a book, or hung in a museum.  They tell the story of one of the artist's pictures and bring the artist to life.

These movies are worth the money and the time to view them.  You will watch them over and over.",1171929600,18,388,4.133333333333334
