8610988,5,B002CB941Q,"While some of us may reach a goal and say 'now I'm finished', others will say'what's next?'. This DVD speaks to the importance of goal setting and how it affects our lives. The producer does a wonderful job explaining how learning is a lifelong journey, and that we never really arrive. If we are not continuously learning, we will be left behind. Great DVD for parents to watch with their pre-teens, as well as young adults preparing for college.",1345593600,,447,4.670886075949367
