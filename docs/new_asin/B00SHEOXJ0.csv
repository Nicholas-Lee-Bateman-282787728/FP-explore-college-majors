6983990,4,B00SHEOXJ0,"While I really did enjoy this collection set, it is a little boring on the first two disks.  While we do get to see Robins amazing backstory, there is also a lot of recap filler in it that you will most likely skip.  Really the only good thing about those episodes are the little 3 minute shorts that follow at the end of them.  The last two disks are great though, and they feature just about all of the fights in ennies lobby (excluding zoro's and Luffy's fight finales).  Outside of the filler, this is really a great set of episodes, and just builds on to the awesomeness that is already ennies lobby.",1427760000,2,605,4.327433628318584

6983992,5,B00SHEOXJ0,"I might buy this with collection 13 instead of getting it day one, to many fillers and still wouldn't be the ending of Enies Lobby Arc until C13 drop but I will most def buy it in the near future .",1425945600,2,197,3.8292682926829267

6984007,3,B00SHEOXJ0,"So I absolutely love one piece and the collections. However, the first 2 discs of this are backstories that are only nice if you for some reason decided to not start at the first collection. They also waste so much of the episodes going over things that have happened. I'd say half of the collection you could do without watching which was pretty disappointing. They also waste 2 episodes on this weird christmas/new year's special. I'm hoping collection 13 goes back to the usual quality.",1437868800,,489,4.764705882352941

6984020,4,B00SHEOXJ0,"Really good collection for the most part. The only issue is that the first disc (and part of the second) is dominated by filler. It's not even the unique kind of filler that OP usually offers, but literally just flashbacks of stuff we've already seen. It makes a nice refresher for the characters' backstories at least, and there IS a more interesting (and brief) bit of filler in disc 3.

But after that slight hiccup, the action really picks up as the Straw Hats face off with CP9, defeating almost all of them within the set. To think it might have gone a little bit farther if it weren't for all that damned filler.",1431129600,2,619,4.4298245614035086
6984021,5,B00SHEOXJ0,"The collection was good for the most part. The first disk you can skip because it's  fillers , I say the first 10 episodes.  After the first 10 episodes ,it picks up with Luffy's crew fighting CP9. You  get to see Chopper's full transformation which is epic.  I can't wait for collection 13.  Love the collection , I can't complain.",1430697600,,332,4.466666666666667
