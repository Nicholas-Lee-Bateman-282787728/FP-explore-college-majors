8553661,4,B00AMGIRF2,"The format - the information on Amazon is that this is Region 2 PAL but it appears to be Region 2 NTSC. Humanity and Paper Balloons is way ahead of it's time very modern his last film. I thought it was OK - good but Tange Sazen: The Million Ryo Pot just shines to me.  Neither one has a lot of sword action but Million Ryo Pot blows away about 90% of the movies made afterwards.  Both are worth seeing but Tange Sazen is excellent...  Denjiro Okochi is fantastic as Sazen but the acting is strong in general, the individual that plays the lead in Paper Ballons is very good as well.  . Both look and sound amazingly good all things considered in the two main films, in the third the sound is not that good, kind of echos.  Hope that helps. NTSC not PAL but Region 2.
