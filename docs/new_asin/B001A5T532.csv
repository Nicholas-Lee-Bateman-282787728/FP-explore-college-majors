8276199,4,B001A5T532,"This is a really good two-disc set taken from shows previously aired on The History Channel, but with more content and Arthur Kent narrating. It is worth a look if you haven't seen the older versions from the multi-pack set. A really good effort that tries to shed a different light on a brutal subject.",1360540800,,303,4.527272727272727
