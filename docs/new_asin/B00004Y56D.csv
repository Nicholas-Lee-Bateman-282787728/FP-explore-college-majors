1371243,4,B00004Y56D,"I saw this Thursday evening and I was very excited and could not wait. I always enjoyed Singer's vision of the X-Men even though he doesn't always have the best character development or the most amazing action scenes compared to other super hero movies. But he always delivers and his spin seems to work for me.

I read all the negative reviews online and saw the horrible rating on Rotten Tomatoes and came to the conclusion that this was another GREAT film with horrible reviews and was given the unnecessary treatment that Batman V Superman received (That film is a masterpiece by the way). Unfortunately, I have to say that I can understand why it did receive bad reviews. This is a GOOD film, but it doesn't topple Days of Future Past (DOFP) and perhaps its because I had high expectations and its Singer or perhaps DOFP was done so well that nothing after it can compare? Who knows for sure.

As noted, I like this film, but it definitely suffered from some pacing issues. I don't have an issue with long films because when its a masterpiece, nobody wants it to truly end. The development in the beginning does take awhile to kick into gear and that's some of the films faults. Finally when it does kick into gear, it isn't as EPIC as it should be. I also had a hard time connecting to Apocalypse because his motives are a bit unclear. Does every villain just want to rule the world? If so, that just isn't enough for his character in this film. Oscar Issac, the actor is amazing and delivers, but aside form the pacing issues and a 3rd arc action scene that was wasted, this is a good film. I think Singer should definitely work on his character development because all the pieces are there, but they get wasted.

For instance, what is Psylocke's purpose in this film? We never know. She is just there and doesn't say much. Jubliee again? Yup, and she does NOTHING yet again. Jennifer Lawrence. Why is she here? She had no emotion in any of her lines. Her delivery was as lifeless as her pose. She showed up for a paycheck. Someone get Rebecca Romijn back please! Quicksilver has an opportunity to deliver a big secret to Magneto and he never does. The end fight scene is not as EPIC as it should have been. Singer definitely needs to work on these issues.

Aside from those negatives, McAvoy and Fassbender always deliver and the new young cast do a superb job. This is a good film, but just not the masterpiece I had hoped for.",1464393600,6,2436,4.467415730337079
1371244,5,B00004Y56D,"Although the original comic books has a better story development,the TV adaptation is pretty cool. When I first watched this part of the serie,with Apocalypse,I didn't get it at all(I think that's why I liked it so much ^^)but then I watched it again I thought X-men was one of the most intelligent American animated serie ever!.Yeah,the story(TV version)has some weak points,most of them due to the fact that some even doesn't even appeare in the comic and if they due,they doesn't until later on in the story or maybe in previews comic books. It's kinda confusing but it's fun. Watch it,if you like the comic you'll probably like this one too.",1001116800,,645,4.767857142857143
1371245,5,B00004Y56D,When I first viewed this video I remember being amazed by how good it was.  I thought there were cheesy parts (like how some characters walk around public in their costumes) but altogether i thuroughly enjoyed the plot.  I feel this one could be greatly adapted to the big screen for a sequel to the live action 2000 blockbuster X -Men.  This is worth picking up for anyone who enjoyed the comic as a kid or even for anyone who enjoyed the movie.,975369600,7,446,4.349397590361446

1371275,4,B00004Y56D,"X-Men: Apocalypse(2016) is an enjoyable X-Men movie from director Bryan Singer. It runs out of stamina during the last ten minutes. In the year 1983, the X-Men have to save the world from a powerful mutant called Apocalypse(played by Oscar Isaac, from the new Star Wars movies). There's a brief cameo by Hugh Jackman. Olivia Munn is drop dead gorgeous as Psylocke! SMOKING HOT! AAARRROOOOGAAAHHH!
Lisa Olivia Munn is pure, distilled eye candy! Her purple costume is a deadly weapon! In high school around 1998, my friend and I would talk about Psylocke. We were getting turned on by a woman who was a two-dimensional drawing on paper! For a time, I had a crush on the Darna character(from Filipino comic books). I even bought my friend a 1988 X-Men comic book with Psylocke on the cover as a Christmas gift.
We'll see who has the last ""ho"" on Christmas, Santa. Psylocke was created by two British guys in 1975. In the 1980's, she was given a makeover. Munn was really funny on G4's Attack of the Show where she did killer impersonations of Wonder Woman and Princess Leia Organa.
I want Olivia Munn to smash my face into the side of a ship! This X-Men film is visually-stunning, action packed fun.",1521417600,,1196,4.64622641509434

Older Logan and older storm supposedly meet nightshade for the first time after professor x tracks him and they find him in a church and here of his origin in the circus....how is this possible if they battled apocalypse together as teens????

1371293,4,B00004Y56D,"1 - there weren't any stupid lines in the movie. the ones that add no value to the story. simply there for filler
2 - no bad acting (not that we needed big names for it). Simply the director and producer did a good job not making scenes fall flat
3 - no sex scene or even wild make out scene. Those only make people uncomfortable... if i wanna watch a porn, i will
4 - no sexual innuendos or overly sexualized characters as it is incredibly annoying when the movie focuses on a girl's tits or ass. yeah mystique has cute tits (lawrence has 32c tits and she's 5'9"".. they obviously helped her with that) but the camera angles don't focus on them. The story never focused on mystique or anyone being sexy.
5 - story was solid. again, that was dependent on the producers/director. actors had no part to play in the writing of the story

why did i dock a star you ask?
because at the very very end, the last 10 seconds of the movie they have a caption saying ""this movie helped support over 15,000 jobs during its making""
umm..... why should i give a flying F__??
they spend easily over 200million on just the few main actors salary.

considering the fact that you can watch these movies for free, there is absolutely no reason why i would need to donate my hard earned money to make multi millionaires even richer

Unfortunately, she is a main character in this outing and her acting brings down her scenes. Apocalypse is realized about as well as can be. Most of the franchises' characters are multi-faceted than simply being a big-bad who wants to take over the world. While the idea of- SPOILER ALERT- the first/ancient mutant who simply thinks he should be worshiped for being superior is different, it doesn't make for the action packed, highest stakes, event they are going for. There are good set-pieces and elements here and there, but so is spotty plotting, and none of these elements can overcome the fact that the film is going for a less sophisticated spectacle than movies that came before. Unfortunately, it isn't something comic moviegoers haven't seen before, and doesn't have the fun or violence to match. I prefer X-Men movies to be more thoughtful or emotional.

1371324,1,B00004Y56D,"When all your friends say its a giant disappointment, you should really listen to them. I walked out of this onepretty disappointed. If you like explosions and super power shenanigans cranked up to a high voltage meter, than this is definitely your film, but for those that are seeking a character driven story that many of us desire out of an X-men movie, than, Id skip this one and stick with Brian Singers first two movies in the franchise. Its a disaster because you would think that Brian Singer would know how to tell a good character driven epic. I mean there where the first two X-Men movies and First Class and Days of Future Past weren't bad either. Those set the bar for how comic book hero movies should be handled. Hell, he directed Usual Suspects for crying out loud. So you would think that another X-men movie would be well within his scope, but he clearly misses the goal by a long shot.

Just because you throw in a ton of X-Men in a story does not make a good X-Men story; doing so just feels like your throwing in fan service without any substance to latch onto. It would be as fruitful as throwing a bunch of X-Men character cards at the audience and saying that that was the story, you got heroes! And maybe they did this a bit with the other film, but, even a brief cameo of Colossus in X-2 had more character development than most of the characters in this film. What I am getting at is that what we really want to see in any film is a story given to us by characters. We want to see character development not just pretty faces. The biggest problem with this movie is that it throws us a ton of characters without any themes, motivation, or any development to latch onto. After the fifth shiny power explosion I got bored.

With that said, the visual effects aren't the problem. Audiences know by now that visual effects don't tell a story. If you want big explosions, go see a fireworks show, for all of us movie lovers, literature, and comic book fans, we want a well-told story. This means focus on the characters that we love, and toss them in a theme or two that are interesting, things that they strive for, fail at, and succeed in in order to pull on our heartstrings and remind us what it is to be a hero.  There was a lot of potential in this film but too much on a plate with too little flavor which they tried to make up for with a bunch of sprinkles. Its a waste, don't watch it! Seriously watch a movie like Logan or stick to the other X-men movies. This one ranks right up there with X-3 oh the cringing that comes with just thinking about that one. Both are bad, and not in the good way. If you watch this one you will be like Magneto going What have I done?",1515369600,,2697,4.263671875

That alone makes me dislike the film.

For some reason, Hollywood likes to lie about history and the peoples who created history - at least when it comes to blacks!  Maybe it's because the peoples who run Hollywood claim to be something they are not, so they manipulate the real people to closer fit themselves, even though that too is a lie.  I guess when you add up the Free Mason obsession with Egypt and Egypt being the source for the Abrahamic religions - they hate to show them on film as they were - black and African!  The fact that they have to make it a point to keep changing their racial make up with fiction shows you how desperate they are.  Like films from the 50's and 60's featuring Egypt, they put mixed race peoples (mainly hispanic, then East Indians and so-called arabs of the lighter shade...) to play any great ancient blacks, while throwing in a few real blacks to make it seem more authentic, but relegating them to the background - as usual.

The film itself was on the boring side with little actions.  As I was watching, I could not help but to think that this comic super hero genre will come to an end soon and Disney will have spent way too much trying to control everything, that it will be worthless after a while.  I say that because like anything hero/villain deal, we know up front who wins and who loses!  That alone lessens the excitement.  After a while, audiences will grow tired of them.

X-Men kicked off the current super hero films blockbusters and they largely got them right to start in presentation, but they quickly made the series convoluted as they put together characters who did not coexist together during certain time periods while leaving others out.  For instance, we saw Banshee and Ice-Man (hardly in the series), yet we never saw Thunderbird, even though he was short lived.  They also seemed to focus too much on Mystique for some reason (it's not as if she was a main focus in the comics) and Wolverine (for popularity) but totally ignored Juggernaut (who WAS popular in the comics) and Colossus!  They gave them bit parts.

They also confused audiences from the first series to First Class to this one by merging them together, starting over and weeding out the actors who were too old to play their characters again.  I saw the need, but the way they did it was not cool.  Also, like I wrote, they focus too much on Mystique, who spent most of her times as the ENEMY of the X-Men, not the buddy.  On top of that, she was hardly a main character, so I cannot understand why the film makers focused on her so much when others like the Hellfire Club, Sentinels, Juggernaut and some others were more popular with comic fans.

So they jumbled this one up with Apocalyspe being too strong and boring, this made for not so much action and less diversity in COMIC BOOK characters.  They had the new Storm, which is fine, but they put her in Egypt instead of Kenya where she was from and they lightened her up from the comics as well, so add that toe lightening up the ancient Egyptians as conscious racism.  Storm also spoke in a Hollywood ""if you don't know the accent, it will cover all bases"" accent!  This was weird.

Like many said, this was the worse one, but I liked The Last Stand because at least it had Juggernaut in it.  They just need to get their character arrangement better and put less focus on back-end characters and lay off Magneto!!  Yes, he was major in EARLY X-Men lore, but he was not in EVERY damned X-Men adventure and eh too spent 99% of his time being the ENEMY of the X-Men, not their friend!  Hopefully the next one won't feature Magneto, but due to the story line, I know it has to feature Mystique.  Why do Nightcrawler and Mystique have lines on their faces?  That makes them less believable.  How come the Beast is blue and not black?  In the comics, they often draw black characters blue in order to show detail, not because they were blue.  I think Nightcrawler and Mystique were supposed to be black as well.  Nightcrawler also had an a short afro in the comics too...

Oh yeah, many of the actors they chose are not the most attractive either, but I guess not everyone in real life is either.  I still do not like their picking and choosing interesting mutants from all eras instead of sticking with the ones from the time of the story/period they are focusing on...",1513900800,,4838,4.439411098527747
1371333,4,B00004Y56D,"Alright guys and gals! I really did like this movie, but in my great honest opinion... if the movie people are gonna write this way, they are seriously gonna have to consider revamping the whole X-Men franchise. Yes I'll probably get some backlash, but X-Men: First Class and X-Men: Apocalypse are in a different group of their own. These two films do not really follow X-Men, X2, and X-Men: The Last Stand. I mean, some of the characters in Apocalypse don't fully come about until like X2. For example, Nightcrawler, we all know he was in the German Cirus, but he didn't come to Xavier's School for the Gifted as a child with Mystique; he was used as a ""weapon"" being controlled by Stryker in X2 and that's when Jean and Storm brought him to Xavier's. And another thing, I loved how Jean used her full power at the end of Apocalypse, but wouldn't you think after she let go, she would try to harness and control her gift?

This movie actually had more action in it than the first and second X-Men
movies did, and I was impressed by it very much! :-) The opening sequence in ancient Egypt
which was awesome! It looked like a lot of effort was put into the main villain's costume!
All the under-foot characters had great screening time! Magneto's 'new' tragic story was
well played-out. It's great that we got to see a 're-do' of Scott Summer's (Cyclops) origin.
The theory of the four horseman of the apocalypse played out well in the movie, and was
a nice touch. When Apocalypse was getting his four ...uh, ... henchmen, I liked how he
was using bribes with giving them more power, and he pretty much did give them more...!
Logan / Wolverine's cameo was awesome, and it establishes the relationship
between him and Jean Grey. Loved the scene when they came out of the movie theater
and discussing how 'Star Wars: Return Of The Jedi' was compared to the first two Star Wars
films (I think they were giving hints to the first three X-Men films). The action was strong and
exciting! The final battles were epic and amazing! I personally think this is one of the better
X-Men movies... powerfully so...! I also think it was hyped over too much, and that is what
critics fell prey too with this movie. Or maybe they were not big X-Men fans...Lol!
Overall, I loved this movie, equally with X-Men, X2, and Days Of Future Past! And better than

I understand this is sort of part of the rewrite for the series. However There are so many problems with the writing that it destroys this attempt. One of the best examples (of many) that show how sloppy the writing was is the fact the Jean Grey taps into The Phoenix powers as an adolescence. The prequel really destroyed any continuity that any of the series, comic or cartoons ever had.  It also downplayed Jean Grey's mental abilities by immediately bypassing her powers and jumping right to The Phoenix's powers as being her superior power then The Phoenix was actually a separate entity and not truly part of Jean Grey.",1504396800,,634,4.702702702702703

If you have any experience with the comics, you'll know who Apocalypse is.  If you don't know, he's an ancient mutant, sometimes considered the first mutant.  He has myriad powers and an ego that surpasses Storm's, which is A LOT of ego.  And he's immeasurably powerful.  In here, his history is lightly followed based on what actually happens in the comics.  He is immortal only by taking the life force of other mutants and going into a hibernation after having assimilated the mutants powers hes drawn the life force from.  This is why his power is nearly unparalleled.

Once in modern times, he recruits Magneto, Storm, Psylocke, and Archangel as his four horsemen.  (This is a deviation from the comics.)  After that, he augments their power by tenfold and unleashes them on an unsuspecting world, allowing them to cause incalculable damage.

In ride the X-men, except they're not the seasoned team found in past movies.  These are kids -- well, technically, teens.  They're still learning their powers.  Hell, they're still learning their bodies, what with puberty having set in for some of them less than five years prior.  This cavalcade of misfits has to face off against the god-like horsemen.  Mutant powers and hair start flying until the end of the film.

I didn't find the plot to be anything to write home about.  I wasn't glued to anyone.  I certainly didn't feel invested in anyone.  There was just nothing to this film that kept me connected.  I found myself wishing for the end to come about halfway through.\

ACTING

It's decent, although Fassbender turns in a pretty good performance of a vengeful Magneto.  The cast of X-men aren't really anything impressive.  Perhaps you can chock it up to age?  None of them displayed any qualities that made me want to learn more about them.  If I had to choose a preferred one, I would say Nightcrawler.

SPECIAL EFFECTS

Sure, there is large-scale destruction -- buildings being lifted off the ground, huge bolts of lightning ripping through the sky, grandiose fights between the X-men and horsemen.  But there was really nothing terribly impressive.  Everything I saw  was something that was either done in another Marvel film or just simply wasn't impressive.  But this is where this series falls short.  It's not that you should base your entire film off special effects, but in superhero movies, special effects are going to be one of the most important aspects.  The X-men film series has always seemed second-rate to the Avengers, which is saying a lot, considering Avengers debuted many years after the first X-men film.

GENERAL THOUGHTS

Bryan Singer needs to go.  He's not a bad director, but he's not a good one, either.  The past few X-men films have been heavily criticized for either lacking a plot or showcasing subpar acting, or both.  We need new blood, a new vision, a new perspective.  Is this film bad?  Of course not.  Is it good?  Of course not.

I would recommend this film if you want to see some people flying through the sky and shooting lasers out of their hands.  Otherwise, you'd do well by waiting for the next Avengers project.",1504137600,,3446,4.820205479452055

I cannot believe that this was Bryan Singer.  Definitely the worst X-Men film to date.  It doesn't even make sense in the context of the others.

The Fantastic Four and Ghost Rider were worse... but other than those two super-hero films, I'm hard pressed to think of one beneath X-Men Apocalypse.  Even the Ang Lee version of the Hulk was better than this.

When I first signed up with NETFLIX they were advertising 4K in their list of movies but now they have ""removed"" their banner or category list of 4K movies and ""hid"" their so called ""SHORT LIST"" of 4K movies deep in their search engine.  These so called true 4K movies have only a ""slight edge"" over Blu-ray 1080p and 4K is ""NOT"" 4 times the resolution of 1080p Blu-ray, my eyes tell me a different story since ""beauty is in the eye of the beholder"".

I had a couple of issues with the script and did not like the new ""young"" Jean (actress just not right for me).  Sorry but I really had issues with  the hair for Mystique (chuckle).

Quicksilver provides lots of fun to the film, while Fassbender makes you care about the villainous Magneto. The film squanders an opportunity to explore the father-son relationship between Magneto and Quicksilver, which is a shame. Many of the characters like Angel and Psylocke are completely under developed. They are just there to fight and show off some superpowers but have no real personality. The film indulges in too much disaster porn. Also offensive is seeing Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) being portrayed as a role model for and leader of the X-Men. What? Seriously. How dumb.

The script and plot and acting were too too tooooo often...just over the top stuff now instead of ""everything's tops and pops.""  Even the laws of physics complained a dozen times that superpowers are one thing but mass is mass and power is ordinary not magical, but the story insists on the magical and gives us the finger and tell us to google the material instead of expecting the script to carry the whole universe's weight of history.  BAH.  Five stars even this time though because I'm easily distracted and I was not bored all that often....and I remember liking the film way more the 1st time.  It's a must see if one is a fan.  I don't think I should watch this again for years.....say, 2020?.....when there is expected to be an economic Apocalypse.  I'm still a sucker for how super powers are integrated into personality, but these days, a slew of powers everywhere.....becoming a slog to keep them all straight.

8-15-17 4th viewing and quite a bit was not immediately recalled and the pacing was too fast to have the mindfulness to anticipate the next scenes.....though some were.  Meanwhile the now-seen flaws are there, but this viewing still shows the heft of this production and though the story didn't grab me much of ""else"" did well enough to keep me around.

Comparing it to a movie like Logan, which knows who the character is and -- though hyper-violent -- has a tender heart amid the chaos and death. In Apocalypse, the stakes are low.

1371690,4,B00004Y56D,"The X-MEN films paved the way for the current status of the comic book film and pushed it to places we never would have imagined. In all fairness it, is about time that these kinds of films were given this praise. X-MEN has seen some highs and lows but, after seeing the return of Bryan Singer with the help of Matthew Vaughn with 'X-MEN: First Class', this franchise has gotten back on track. Now we get the newest edition to the franchsie as well as one of the most popular and most powerful villains in 'X-MEN: Apocalypse'

This film deserves more credit than it has received. It fits into the newly re-vamped X-MEN universe very well. While I feel that Apocalypse was not as gargantuan and menacing as he is in the comics I feel that Oscar Issac did a great job. Seeing some of the classic X-MEN characters return to the film time line in younger forms including Sophie Turner and Ty Sheridan were very good and the story was very well done too. Not to mention some very strategically placed 1980s music within the film.

Of course stick around for the end to see a very exciting end credits scene. It made me very excited for another X-MEN film that I know for a fact Bryan Singer is already working on.",1492300800,,1208,4.4125560538116595

1371743,5,B00004Y56D,"Released in 2016 and directed/co-written by Bryan Singer, X-Men: Apocalypse has the team go up against the first mutant, Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac), whose origins date back to ancient Egypt. After thousands of years in stasis, Apocalypse  is immediately disillusioned by the state of the world and so recruits a team of worthy mutants, including a dispirited Magneto (Michael Fassbender), to purge humanity and craft a new world order, over which he will reign. Professor X (James McAvoy), with the assistance of Raven (Jennifer Lawrence), leads a team of young X-Men to stop their greatest nemesis and save mankind from complete destruction. Josh Helman is on hand as Col. Stryker.

This sixth film in the franchise (not including the four spinoff films, as of this writing) easily ranks as one of the best IMHO. Why? Because it includes many of the best elements of the X-Men and everything I would want in a great X-Men flick: Professor X's ongoing goal for an educational sanctuary for interesting mutants from all over the world; his love for Moira (Rose Byrne); Magneto's increasing mastery of his great powers and his struggle to go on the offensive against prejudiced humanity; a greater focus on Cyclops (Tye Sheridan) and his potent power, both of which were neglected in the original trilogy; an outstanding actress to play Jean Grey (Sophie Turner), who is far better than the bland Famke Janssen; Olivia Munn's ultra-hotness as Psylocke; a worthy subplot on Weapon X with the corresponding guest appearance of Wolverine (Hugh Jackman); an excellent collection of young mutants, like Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Beast (Nicholas Hoult), Quicksilver (Evan Peters), Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee), Havok (Lucas Till), Angel (Ben Hardy), etc.; a worthy main villain in the mold of Dr. Doom and Thanatos; an epic, apocalyptic final act (sorry); I could go on and on.

This isn't to say the movie doesn't have faults, however; the cartoony overblown prologue in ancient Egypt is Exhibit A. Yet the movie swiftly recovers and finds its footing.

The film runs 144 minutes and was shot in Quebec, Canada (Greenfield Park, Montreal and Oka).

While this film is not without its flaws, I honestly do not get the hate surrounding X-Men: Apocalypse. I mean seriously a 48% on rotten tomatoes?! I'm not calling this Shakespeare or anything but, I don't think it's as bad what people are making it out to be. While it's titular villain, Apocalypse (played by Oscar Issac), is corny and underdeveloped, the rest of the film is great. The quicksilver sequence is fun, Jean Grey, Storm, Nightcrawler, and Cyclops are great on screen, and the finale (while reminiscent of a Saturday morning cartoon) was both entertaining and had sense of urgency among its protagonists that feels earned. I will say that I wish they developed Angel and Psylocke a lot more than they did and that Wolverine bit felt forced but, other than some of its glaring flaws, X-Men: Apocalypse is the weakest in the First Class trilogy but, in this case that doesn't mean that it's bad.

And this movie proves my point you don't have to have Wolverine in every X-Men movie to have a good X-Men movie he does shows up for a cameo and that's all that was needed. To tell you the truth I hope Wolverine is not in the next X-Men movie because there are enough nutis in the X-Men history to do several movies without Wolverine.

1371816,5,B00004Y56D,"After the timeline-altering events of X-Men: Days Of Future Past, filmmakers were left with a mostly blank slate to rebuild a new X-Men continuity on, and they've taken advantage of that opportunity to brilliant effect in X-Men: Apocalypse.  Picking up ten years after Future Past, in 1983, Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) has shelved his idea of setting up a mutant super team in favor of concentrating on operating a school and championing peaceful co-existance between humans and mutants by less bombastic means.  Magneto (Michael Fassbender) has thought better of trying to take over the planet and put it under mutant control, and instead is living peacefully with a new family under an assumed identity in Poland.  Both are forced, as are many other characters, to radically re-evaluate their goals and plans after the re-emergence of the mutant En Sabah Nur (Oscar Issac), also known as Apocalypse.

Apocalypse ruled the world before the current version of recorded history began ten thousand years ago, and probably would never have been ousted from that throne if not for being betrayed by some of his followers during a special set of circumstances where he was vulnerable for a few short moments.  This part is told in the opening minutes of the movie, before switching to 1983.  His betrayers only trapped him though, they didn't kill him, and now the world's most dangerous mutant is back and ready to make up for lost time.  I originally though Oscar Issac might be two physically small to play Apocalypse, who's usually depicted as massive in the comic books.  Isaac did a smashing job though, and good use of camera angles, special effects and the job done on creating his armor make him ever every bit as intimidating on screen as on the page.  A number of other X-Men characters also make their first onscreen appearances here, plus many more are here in new versions (compared to their pre-timeline-alteration appearances).

The movie gets both the huge action scenes and the character-oriented drama scenes right, and this is essential viewing for anyone who's ever been into the X-Men at all.  And, as with most comic book movies, keep watching past the final credits for a dramatic sneak peak at what may lay in the series's future.",1490832000,,2252,4.946949602122016

The main bad guy was monochromatic in more ways than just his costume. The few X-Men that are shown are lackluster at best and don't really reach any of their potential. Mystique was a pleasant stand-out giving a good performance and fairly believable motivations. I have to give Nightcrawler a nod as well. While his performance was not Oscar worthy, he gave us a nice take on the character. Most of the characters felt like they were just along for the ride.",1490659200,,706,4.348484848484849

After buying around 20 titles on UHD, this one really stood out to me as very impressive. After looking at the Blu-Ray disc afterwards, it became even more impressive. Lots of great detail, color and the HDR added to the movie. The only downside is that you're forced to choose between a 4K UHD (+Blu-Ray +digital copy) or 3D 1080p (+blu-ray + digital copy) with this title. I was very tempted to get the 3D, but overall loved the detail in the 4K UHD version.

Well, for some of them, he was not a god and try to assassinate him while in the midst of a ""transfer"" of power to a younger body.
We then move forward to current 1983 where we see Professor X and the younger cast of X-Men doing there thing at Xavier's school for the gifted.
I am not a comic book fanatic or reader of the X-Men comics, but I would have thought the four horseman could have been better selected and not well known.
One indication would have been who were the ""horsemen"" he used before? We saw a scene with him moving the stones into pyramids at the end of the credits in ""Days of Future Past"". I'm sure they died off in some form, however.
The mutant is awoke by digging humans and his tomb comes into contact with the Sun. He wanders around the city and seeks out other mutants to aide in his ""recovery"" to a higher power for himself.
It's only a matter of time before the younger X-Men learn of his return and must confront him and his powers.
I really liked Mystique here and Quicksilver, but I wished there were more scenes of Mystique. Magneto has a good time being him, of course, tricked into becoming ""Apocalypse's"" pawn.
After a brief encounter by Mystique and Quicksilver, Magneto realizes he has ""family"" worth fighting for and a better future with the mutants.

1371942,5,B00004Y56D,"I happened to catch X-Men: Apocalypse on one of the premium satellite channels this past weekend.  Having watched all the others I was curious what this could lend to the mythology others had not.  First, I was very pleased with the choices of characters and stage of development they were in.  Second, while the choice of actors wouldn't not necessarily been who I had chosen, those in the roles were very, very good.  Lastly, I loved the story line.  I worked well.

In a world where CGI is taken for granted because it now looks so seamless, Apocalypse offered very good viewing.  The colors were bright, the story a little dark.  It was a good balance of each.  I would certainly watch this again.",1488844800,,701,4.588709677419355

1371948,4,B00004Y56D,"A great effort. Apocalypse as a character is a bit underdone, but the other character development makes this a movie to be enjoyed.",1488672000,,131,4.739130434782608
1371949,2,B00004Y56D,I gave this movie a 2 because it had all the cgi associated with a great X-man movie. Having stated that I took away 3 points because the director made it way to long and he left so many gapping themes that had been established with previous movies. If you are 10 then you don't seen the flawed story line and the out right changing of certain characters past that have already been established within the story line of previous X-men movies but for the rest of the world it can be intellectual insulting to watch. The director is merely a director not the next best thing to sliced bread so my advice keep to the historical context themes with your movies Bryan Singer,1488672000,,669,4.403225806451613
1371950,4,B00004Y56D,"""X-Men: Apocalypse"" is great. This is how the story goes: Since the dawn of civilization, he was worshipped as a God. Apocalypse, the first and most powerful mutant from Marvel's X-Men universe, amassed the powers of many other mutants, becoming immortal and invincible. Upon awakening after thousands of years, he is disillusioned with the world as he finds it and recruits a team of powerful mutants, including a disheartened Magneto, to cleanse mankind and create a new world order, over which he will reign. As the fate of the Earth hangs in the balance, Raven with the help of Professor X must lead a team of young X-Men to stop their greatest nemesis and save mankind from complete destruction.

The cast led by James McAvoy (solid as usual as Charles), Michael Fassbender (in another well-crafted performance as Erik Lehnsherr / Magneto) & Jennifer Lawrence (also solid as usual as Raven / Mystique) is great. The directing by Bryan Singer (who also co-wrote the story & produced) is great. The story by Singer, Simon Kinberg (who also produced and wrote the screenplay), Michael Dougherty & Dan Harris & the screenplay by Kinberg is great.

The music by John Ottman (who also co-edited the film) is great. The cinematography by Newton Thomas Sigel is great. The film editing by Ottman & Michael Louis Hill is great. The casting by Roger Mussenden is great. The production design by Grant Major is great. The art direction by Ravi Bansal, Michele Laliberte, Veronique Meunier & Charlotte Rouleau is great. The set decoration by Geoffroy Gosselin & Anne Kuljian, set dressings by Nicolas Fering, Michel R. Lambert, Ron Novak & Georges Samuel, set designs by Etienne Gravrand, Brent Lambert, Raymond Larose & Lucie Tremblay is great. The costume design by Louise Mingenbach is great. The make-up effects coordinated by Kathy Tse, designed by Caroline Aquin & supervised by John Rosengrant is great. The special effects coordinated by Adam Heinis & supervised by Cameron Waldbauer & Steve Hamilton is great. The visual effects designed by John Dykstra & Greg Strause, coordinated by Sapna Agrawal, Michael Asiman, Tom Barber, Jillian Brooks, Daniel Charchuk, Dominique Chartrand, Anwei Chen, Allan Peresh Christian, Nathalie Cyr, Stanislas de Lesquen, Ekaterina Diaz, Andrew Fitchett, Andr Geoffroy, Kat Gore, David Gullman, Geraint Hixson, Carole-Anne Hbert, Yann Jouannic, Patricia Leblanc, Constance Lvesque, Francesca Mancini, Amelie Marcoux, Miranda Middlewood, Chelsea Mirus, Alexander Naud, Kinga Sabela, Esteban Sanchez, Katherine Terzieva, Kallan Treadwell, Jon Warne & Trevor Wyatt and supervised by Nicolas Chevallier, Anders Langlands, Immanuel Morris, Jonathan Piche-Delorme, Mathieu Raynault, Colin Strause & Aleksandar Vishemirski is great. The stunts coordinated by Nick Brandon, James M. Churchman, Jeff & Trevor Habberstad, Paul Leonard & fights coordinated by Garrett Warren & Walter Garcia is great.

This is a great, solidly crafted and solidly entertaining film that is well-made and well-made. Bryan Singer has directed another great X-Men movie. James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender & Jennifer Lawrence are solid as usual in a solid supporting cast that includes Oscar Issac (as En Sabah Nur / Apocalypse), Nicholas Hoult (as Hank McCoy / Beast), Rose Byrne (as Moira Mactaggert), Evan Peters (as Peter Maximoff / Quicksilver), Josh Helman (as Col. William Stryker), Sophie Turner (as Jean Grey), Tye Sheridan (as Scott Summers / Cyclops), Lucas Till (as Alex Summers / Havok), Kodi Smit-McPhee (as Kurt Wagner / Nightcrawler), Ben Hardy (as Angel), Alexandra Shipp (as Ororo Munroe / Storm), Lana Condor (as Jubilee) & Olivia Munn (as Psylocke). This was one of the better movies of last year (also one of the better movies of summer 2016) and also one of the better comic books of last year, as well.",1488672000,,3826,5.2894736842105265

X-Men: Apocalypse is a twenty first century film. Its ninth in the X-Men series, and a sequel to X-Men Days of Future Past. The story revolves around the generic superhero movie of evil vs good. However, discretely the movie questions if humanity is worth saving, and what causes a man to become a monster. The main villain is En Sabah Nur or many call him Apocalypse who is the first mutant. He was used to rule over ancient Egypt until he was betrayed, and ended up being dormant for thousands of years. Once he rose from his slumber he discovered that the weaklings or also known as humans had taken over the world. Enraged and ready to demolish everything that the human had built, he states, and from the ashes of their world we will build a better one. To fulfill his tasks, Apocalypse gathers the strongest mutants to aide with his fight against humanity. Subsequently, the movie enters a constant battle between the X-Men and the evil mutants.
On top of a fun action filled storyline the movie has amazing actors/ actresses such as James McAvoy, Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar Isaac, Olivia Munn, and many more. Having such a fantastic cast brings a range of experience to the film. The actors and actresses were committed to portraying their characters by enhancing their traits. For example, Olivia Munn learned how to wield a sword for many weeks prior to filming, even though the scene of her fighting with the sword was approximately five minutes. The dedication of each actor was apparent.
The movie had fantastic music which was used to evoke emotions in the audience. Some of the most impactful songs were Beethovens symphony no. 5 movement 2, and Sweet Dreams by Quicksilver. The symphony was edited and given darker almost sinister feel to it, which easily gave rise to anxious feelings. On the other hand, when Sweet Dreams, a well-known song with many remakes, was played the audience could relate to the movie, capturing their attention further; some even hummed to the song with a pleasing smile.
Even though X-Men Apocalypse had one distracting aspect, which was the movie jumped around the world quite a bit, almost a little too much to keep up with sometimes. However even with all the jumps it was made sure that the place they intended to illustrate looked authentic and that little details weren't overlooked.
Hence, the movie was excellent because it could utilize the resources to their full capacity, and it has set quite a high bar for new X-Men movie for the future.",1487721600,,2548,4.777777777777778

And this may be the reason why I ended up liking it as I did.

Oscar Isaacs is a good actor but wrong for the part of Apocalypse.  A couple of good scenes, first with Quicksilver and then later when Weapon X gets loose.

1372405,3,B00004Y56D,"This movie is too long, and lacks energy. There seems to be no direction to speak of and most characters act as plot devices rather than actual people. Brian Singer continues to make the same mistakes with the X-Men that he always makes, No TLC for the secondary characters, the story lacks enough heft to carry such a ""big"" production. The plot is so paper thin and predictable that it almost takes you out of the move. He plays with the same dynamic between Magneto and Xavier that he played with in the first five films. In the past Wolverine acted as a strong lead, anchoring the story and giving the audience a good person to connect to. In this movie he uses Magneto in the same role but his story is lacking in spirit and heart. Despite the fact that Fasbender is given some of the more meaty plot points he underwhelms as Magneto this time, he feels a bit disinterested in this movie. McAvoy is bland, Apocalypses is bland, Jean Gray is Bland, even Quicksilver comes off as a pale imitation of his Day of Future past version. As a fan of the X-Men I found it passable if not a little disappointing, as a film fan it is just not as good as it could be or should be.",1486339200,,1172,4.283783783783784

Alan Cumming made a better version but I understand we are seeing the X-Men at their beginning.  The storyline was pretty good and the action was great as usual for the X-men movies.

I think it is about time to cut the series off, as other series should be as well, because there is getting to be too many of them. As long as there is money to be made though, they will continue to make them. I won't write any spoilers in here. I feel that this movie didn't push the franchise forward so that I would want to watch the next, and I assume there is a next. I also felt that the character development was a little poor. With that being said, I did like the action in the movie. The film did keep me entertained to finish it and overall I am satisfied with paying the couple of bucks to watch it. Although, if you are a die hard comic fan of the series you will be a bit disappointed on how things are changed. But really, who keeps things the same anymore. In short, like with the next one, I will wait for it to be streamed and if it is doing well I will watch it, as I don't think it is spending money on the movie theatre worthy anymore but it is still fun to watch.",1485302400,,1068,3.972093023255814

The story is a pre-sequel.and is basically the return of an ancient Egyptian God who has designs to remake Earth like it was. He recruits a young Storm ,turns a heartbroken Magneto,and converts Angel and Psylocke. With these he takes on Xavier and a hand full of loyal mutants. He tries to manipulate Xavier to his will but in the end,where head games are concerned,Xavier wins hands down. This ersatz ""God"" is finally destroyed by a joint effort of mutants loyal to Xavier and most of the others.
There is a tremendous amount going on in this film,and it hops quite unevenly back and forth telling its story. Every time there is a jump, there is a little less involvement with the story,There is even a brief cameo by Wolverine, as the makers throw everything they can into the mix.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and there is a gag reel and commentary.
All in all a big disappointment for the franchise,and the weakest by far. An ultimately unsatisfying tale which plays all over the map...literally, and leaves us wanting. 2 1/2-3 stars.",1484611200,,1279,4.981308411214953

There appear to be some plot lines that they are purposefully leaving open for movies yet to be released, so there are a few oddities in the movie (but I don't want to ruin it for someone that hasn't purchased it yet as a spoiler).  Whether it is valuable to you to purchase this movie in 4k HD depends on the DVD unit you are using.  I recently purchased the Samsung true 4k ultra HD Blu-ray player (model #UBD-K8500) and the graphics on a definitely better than playing a DVD on an upscaling player.  The one annoying detail of buying DVDs these days, are the previews for other movies releasing/released by the studio, no way around those launching when re-watching the main feature, oh well, a small trade off for the superior image quality of 4K UHD.",1484438400,,925,4.542168674698795

It felt to me like some of the actors (Lawrence in particular) were barely interested and basically just there for the paycheck. Also Sophie Turner has not learned to pull of an American accent at all and her turn as Jean Grey was by far the weakest of the newcomers to this franchise
For a blockbuster comic book movie, It was slow in many parts and the ending was meh. Seriously how many times can Magneto go bad only to be redeemed in the end?

1372733,2,B00004Y56D,"The ancient mutant En Sabah Nur/Apocalypse (who has been amassing other mutant's powers over centuries) is beaten in 3000 B.C. Egypt by perfectly normal, everyday Egyptians. He isn't killed, only put to sleep for about 5000 years. While investigating mutants in 1983, Moira McTaggert accidentally awakens Apocalypse who brings together his four horsemen (because he's Apocalypse, get it?) to take over the world. Can Charles Xavier (James McAvoy) and his students and allies stop the madman before his plans wreak havoc? Of course, the answer to that question is obvious, which does not mean the movie can't still be entertaining.

Unfortunately, the film has a lot of things working against it. Many scenes are clearly designed to be seen in 3D, which is distracting when watching a 2D version at home on DVD. The movie also has too many ""this scene is so cool we are going to show it in slow motion"" moments. Which doesn't even include the Quicksilver (the guy who moves at high speed, so naturally he has some slow motion stuff) scenes--they are fun in small doses but again there are too many of them and looks like reruns of scenes from Days of Future Past.

Too many characters are left undeveloped or doing nothing until the end. Poor Angel and Psylocke are little more than eye-candy combatants with no character at all. They are part of the four horsemen but don't do anything until the climatic big battle. The other horsemen, Storm and Magneto, have good development, even with Storm's minimal screen time. Still, they too have almost nothing to do till the finale. Apocalypse even has to kidnap Xavier to make his plan work, making the other four look especially useless.

Having read the Age of Apocalypse graphic novels, I had a good idea of what Apocalypse's plan was, but that's not communicated clearly in the film. Apocalypse talks a lot about the devastation he's going to cause but does hardly any until the ending, even missing some fairly big opportunities early on. He does have menacing physical presence, but his incoherent and slow scheme make him into a lesser villain, which is a shame for someone named Apocalypse.

Other characters fair better. Xavier and Magneto work well as foils for each other (if only Magneto hadn't spent so much time with Apocalypse!). Happily, they don't overshadow the other characters--Cyclopes, Jean Grey, Mystique, and other X-Men get enough character development and moments so they don't look one dimensional like Angel and Psylocke. Director Singer is good at handling a large cast of characters but this movie has too many even for him.

It is a shame that some shining members of the cast are quashed by all the crap they tried to shove in this. No sorry, I did not mean jennifer lawrence. You want a good team movie try the avengers.

The best advice these movie making bafoons should look into is k.i.s.s.

1372786,2,B00004Y56D,"Awful movie and made no sense. Plot dilutes Magneto's plight from First Class and Days of Futures Past. Apocalypse has been a poor villain in the comics since the 90's and this film did nothing but show he's not that interesting of a character. And by having him has the powers of Proteus (reality warping), Fabian Cortez (power enhancement) and Blink (teleportation), it kills any chance of using those characters in the future.

Also, this film was supposed to be about setting the tone for future X-Men films and highlight the newcomers for that plan, but outside of 5-8 minutes of screen time over the first 1 hour, 20 minutes of the film (remember it's a 2 hour, 20 minute movie), they simply are an afterthought until after the mansion scene with Quicksilver.

Angel (an original X-Man) was nothing but a club fighter who becomes enhanced by Apocalypse where his wings turn to metal. Yes Angel drinks and shows he has a dark past, but what leads him to being Archangel (metal winged version) was feathered wings being cut/ripped from his back leading to his self-loathing and suicidal tendencies. That's when Apocalypse tricks him into becoming his most powerful horseman, his Angel of Death. This movie just makes him an obstacle to overcome with no real depth to his character. Same goes for Psylock and even more so for Storm.

Terrible movie and Fox should either think about giving reigns over to a new director other than Brian Singer, or Fox should think about creating a partnership with Marvel like Sony did with Spider-Man. Series is growing stale.",1483574400,,1564,4.8283582089552235

It felt like they tried to do too much with each of the characters so they didn't have time to focus on any one enough for you to really care, especially so for the villain.  Why was the villain the character seen (of major characters) the least amount of time?  I mean Wolverine was probably shown for at least 1/7 as much screen time as Apocalypse, and he was literally a ""oh, look isn't that neat"" cameo.  Aside from the ""he was betrayed"", ""he wants to destroy everything"", and ""oh, look he can switch bodies"" there was no real character development for him.

1372864,4,B00004Y56D,"I will go over with what I liked about the movie first before what was horrid. The best part of this movie is the continued development of Erik Lehnsherr (Magneto) trying to be a normal person, but society not letting him. The continued development of the school is another great part of the storyline. The introduction of Storm, Jean Grey, Cyclops, and Nightcrawler are great. Quicksilver is also more of an important character in the movie; as following the comics. There is also a cameo by Wolverine, but is well done and short. The final battle with Apocalypse was well done as well (trying not to reveal too much). The storyline, for the most part, is actually pretty good.

Now to go over the bad. Apocalypse was horridly done. It never felt like he was portrayed as that powerful in the movie. Most of his mutant abilities were not used as compared to the comics/cartoons. It felt like a waste of a huge potential there. Angel/Archangel's character was barely developed for the movie; neither was Psylocke's. Speaking of Psylocke, the actress choice was horrid as she could not act and looked nothing like Psylocke; outside the costume. They even completely altered her powers from that of the comic. The other part of the movie was the scripting for Mystique. The character felt more like Katniss Everdeen from the hunger games. I can see why they might have tried doing that since it is the same actress, but it was dumb and cheezy. The last part is that Jubilee is pretty much snubbed again as she yet again gets a tiny cameo part (like from the original trilogy). It does, however, look like they nailed the look for that character 100%; so there's hope with the next movie.",1483228800,,1685,4.673400673400673

Apocalypse is an enemy that should feel as big as Thanos, yet the characters and the conflict comes off as half baked, unbelievable and just lazy.  The characters are there, but the things that made them interesting are not.  WITH the exception of Jean Grey.  I was worried about Sansa Stark playing her, but the actress actually did a pretty decent job.  Her unleashing her ""full power"" at the end really ended up being the climax of the movie, which is weird because this movie had so many opportunities to wow us, but just fell flat.  The movie should have been 60 minutes tops, but due to lazy writing it dragged on with no purpose for way too long.  Most ""Meh"" end of the world I've ever seen.",1482969600,,821,4.5

The performances are good for the most part and I always enjoy most of them moving around on the screen for an hour or so. Music is good as well.
The new characters are bit boring and some of the changes to characters I remember from the 80's and 90's version of the x-men were not the best portrayal of them. Apocalypse wasn't very exciting as a character in the comics and really doesn't transfer to the silver screen any better. I have always been an Xavier, Summers and Grey hatter and they do very little to improve the over all story.

1373003,4,B00004Y56D,"Made the best of a mess.

Honestly, the Marvel series brought to life is a real mess with all these different companies with their different rights to different characters. Marvel, Sony, Fox, ect, the last several Marvel movies have made due with their character custody rights. Right.

Back to my review, see, I've always been an X-men fan since it premiered on Fox-Kids oh, so long ago. After the first movie came out, I really got into the comic books. And no, I didn't mind that one of my favorite cartoons, and the pretty good super hero movie was very inaccurate. It was forgivable, and so is my differentiation allowance for ""books into movies.""

So as a fan of movies, I'm saying that this was a really good movie. Worth watching. As a fan of the comic books, being someone who read the exciting Age Of Apocalypse Saga, and the original Apocalypse comic book story line, I'm tilting my hand this way and that. His horseman were blah, and I was really d.o the cut out of Sinister. Even the introduction of young Aurora and Elizabeth Bradshaw weren't enough to hype up this movie. No. That was all done by the classic X-men Jean, Beast, Cyclops, Prof Ex, 2nd gen X-man Nightcrawler, and I've been loving him more and more in these X movies, Quicksilver.

Apocalypse's terror is big in X-men, so I'll admit I was expecting something bigger. It wasn't a disappointment, just not what I was expecting or even wanted. I like the new take on X-men, but for the life of me, between Wolverine, and all the past movies, Mystique (I'm so mad they still haven't spun her character or introduced Destiny into the picture yet), Magneto, and all the directions these movies have been going, and all the changes, I can't tell where this series is going. It's riddled inaccuracies, which I'm finding fault with. Not the changes, the inaccuracies from movie to movie. I feel for any director who does the next movie.

So, yeah, I liked the movie, but what I don't like is being able to keep up with these strange changes from what should be a developed movie franchise swiveling between the past and the future. I also don't like how this movie has to tiptoe around character distribution and compensate for characters they aren't allowed to put in the movie, which are causing rifts. I do like the intensity and moving plot that actually goes somewhere. And guess what. Once again, I found Stan Lee.

It's worth watching. You just have to let go of the comic book and understand that when making movies about fictional worlds in the real world, there is much to be desired. Either way, Thanks James McAvoy for your hard work.",1482278400,,2616,4.61505376344086

To add a bit more to review, I wanted to see the movie for visuals, entertainment, and mainly to forget about work for a bit, and I was not disappointed. Is there a lesson in the movie? A theme?

However, it's an endearing sort of movie that has good scenes to go along with it. Much like you have to excluded the MCU from earth -616 this x-men HAS to be excluded from its comic run. I say I like it when compared to its predecessors like x-men 2 and 3. You get to see characters being introduced in their younger years which is fun and at least Quicksilver got some more screen time. But honestly?

1373064,4,B00004Y56D,"I enjoyed this movie, and shall probably watch it again in the future.  However, it was not the attention grabber for which I had hoped.  The action was more than adequate.  The defeat of Apocolypse is more about the mind, the psyche than it is about a brutal smack-down.  That battle of the mind could have been more fully developed.  This is particularly true vis a vis the Jean Grey character.  She begins as a fearful young person, but must look within to find the strength and power of an adult.  We may surmise that this trandformation occurs, but we are not privy to any of it - mores the pity.  It would ber nice to since a Marvel movie not oriented to the fanboys (and girls), but rather plotted to those of us who remember readking Marvel in our youth, and view these movies as a delightful reminder of our younger days.  This is a more than 3 star movie, but not a four satr by any means.  I would score this as 3 1/3.  I have given it four stars above as compensation for some very ignorant one star reviews that I read.

1373083,2,B00004Y56D,"Spoiler alert: Almost a good film, but misses the mark. New characters are introduced hastily (even if they're franchise favorites like Cyclops, Storm, and Nightcrawler), and a great deal of time is wasted just setting up yet another Wolverine spinoff. Magneto's character arc from villain to semi-hero has been played out enough times, here is just feels tired. But the film's worst sin is the bland character development of Angel. He should be a beloved (well established) hero whose turn to work for the villain feels like a great betrayal. Instead, in the exact same failure as the original X-Men trilogy's poor final entry, he's a confusing side character who desperately needs to have appeared in the earlier films to make any sense. Minor failures include the non-aging of characters despite this trilogy's films being set decades apart and the unnecessary, last minute introduction of matching jumpsuits for our heroes.

Still, in a kind of second attempt at the First Class story, this film ends with a promising (classic) team of young X-Men heroes beginning their training. I enjoyed the performances of all these young heroes and would gladly see them take of the X-Men mantle in future films.",1481587200,,1205,5.055276381909548

1373102,3,B00004Y56D,"Don't want to rehash everyone else's reviews, so I will jsut stick to my own reasons I enjoy the movie, and the things about it that really let me down.

Likes
1.  The cast is pretty spot on all the way across the board, except maybe Cyclops.  That actor was a bit too stiff, even for Scott.
2.  The Quicksilver scene steals the whole show, just like in Days of Future Past.  Not sure he can actually move that fast though...
3.  It's not a movie about Wolverine, finally.  Even though he sneaks in there for a second, shirtless, I was ok with that.
4.  Olivia Munn is so HOT as Psylocke.  Also, finally Psylocke!  (I loved that character back in my comic book days).
5. Takes place in the 80s, when the X-Men were at their most prolific, IMHO.
6.  McAvoy and Fassbender are killing it as Xavier and Magneto.  Even if this was likely their weakest performances of all the films, they are both very good at what they do.

Dislikes
1. Major ball drop on Apocalypse.  Oscar Isaac is a good actor, and he probably could have done this right, but the character was wrote too flat.  He is the greatest threat the x-men ever faced that wasn't also from outer space, and the best plan he could come up with was having magneto rip all the metal from the ground?  What?
2.  What the ---- happened to Banshee?  He's an 80's staple for the X-Men, and he only gets to be in the one that takes place in the 60's?  What a crock!
3.  Psylocke finally makes the cut, and they have the perfect actress to play her, and they don't really use her.  Let down, but I have hope for future movies.
4.  Jean Grey as Phoenix was jsut a CGI crapstorm, where she is basically just standing in front of a green screen and that's it.  One of the most powerful beings in the universe, and that was all they could do with that.  That is at least as bad as Apocalypse's plan to rip all the metal from the earth.

In all, it's a watchable movie, and there's plenty of fun stuff in there for the old fans and new fans alike.  Suspension of disbelief is pushed pretty far at times, but otherwise I dug it.",1481500800,2,2069,4.201017811704834

I purchased the Blu-ray version at a local store for a great price and it also included an additional free digital X-Men movie download. I usually buy my Blu-ray Discs from Amazon but I am a price conscious shopper also.

I thought this film was very entertaining and the blu-ray quality was excellent. I watched the film on a 12 foot diagonal screen and the video quality was perfect. The audio sound in 5.1 stereo was very good and it was like being in the movie theatre. I think Blu-ray is the best way to go for a home theatre system.

I loved that this film had a lot of great actors in it and even some new faces portraying the younger X-Men characters. If you are an X-Men fan then this is a must see film. The battle scenes are great and I was totally immersed into the film. I gave it a 5 star rating and I recommend it for X-Men fans!

I'm not sure what was going on and I really couldn't place my finger on it for the longest time but the whole film felt so disjointed and oddly planned out. Emotions were shoved into scenes at time which had a reverse effect resulting in me not caring for many of the characters. I actually remember saying to my friend at the time ""I liked Batman vs Superman better than this."" I seem to be in the minority here so perhaps it just wasn't my movie but again, the entire thing seemed more amateur than the preceding films.

I don't get this new Hollywood trend with using skinny pretty boys who look like kids in action adventure films. (Cyclops, Nightcrawler, Angel) What the hell happened to men looking like men? Forgive my small rant. But in truth, this film was so all over the place with their story it was wasteful. Not to mention to mention it's not even slightly exciting. Characters like Jubilee & Psylocke were so under sold you could almost think they were not in the film. The Logan cameo was a nice set up for the up coming Logan film though.

1373438,2,B00004Y56D,"Honestly, this was one of the worst movies that I had seen in a while, X Men or otherwise. It was the first movie in recent memory that I actually told people to avoid. I had lost all faith in the X Men movie universe (which was shortly thereafter saved by the Logan trailer, now we're talkin!)

Honestly, there's not much to say. It's predecessors (First Class and Days of Future Past) were vastly superior. The returning cast does their best, while the new cast, Apocalypse included, are given little to do. The CGI somehow looks awful, the story is paper thin, and the action is half hearted. It has a few memorable scenes and a few ideas that could have been great, but overall, this is disappointing.",1480291200,,705,4.5078125

1373447,4,B00004Y56D,"I'm not a big X-Men fan, though I have more of a childhood soft-spot for the ""old"" X-Men over the new.

I recognize some revisions to the mutant timelines have occurred in the 50 years since I read my first issues and the movies continue to reflect this. I hold no critical displeasure with that decision.

While I also acknowledge today's key 18-49 group like their characters morose (and somewhat deadly), I don't see why every character has to be a surly child. With the exception of Hank McCoy, everyone seems like one step up from a punk (and then miraculously, by movie's end, a hero).

That said, the movie was entertaining. As usual, the graphics were outstanding (also as usual, the dialog was choppy). The plot is no surprise to an X-Men reader and also easy enough to follow for newcomers.

I do think these films tend to stick very close to the ""glue"" characters, which means heavy Magneto and Mystique use. I also continue to be befuddled at the lack of relative impact Professor Xavier's ""most powerful mutant mind"" gets in the films, so his more integral role here is pleasing.

There are Easter eggs and ""guest stars"" galore, but I would have to reveal spoilers to talk about them, so I'll merely say comic fans will want to own this film and passerby viewers will want to watch it.",1480291200,25,1298,4.577586206896552

Story was a bit bizarre tho it was nice to see the beginnings of the xmen.  Overall I found the movie lacked engagement of the audience,  instead of drawing you in it shouted at you.

This movie takes place after the Days of Future Past movie which is another excellent choice for superhero fans everywhere. Those who have read the comics for years have read/heard the name Apocalypse before and know that this villain is on a VERY high power level. He ain't no Galactus but he is a LOT stronger than he looks. The X-Men learn that he is the first mutant and he was made by aliens. He ruled as a Pharoah for years until humanity revolted and imprisoned him. Now he has escaped and is out to ""kill all humans""(video game reference anyone?lol) and replace them with mutants that are even stronger than the current ones. The fight is on! However, Apocalypse never counted on one particular mutant that is far more than she appears to be. FAR...MORE. Hint: Just as long as she does ""not let it control her.""

1373473,1,B00004Y56D,"Such a horrible waste of an amazing history.  There were SO MANY GOOD STORIES to tell about Apocalypse.  They've been told.  They're right there for you to use.  But did they?  Of course not.  They grabbed a few themes from them and wrote this garbage.  No tension, no emotion, no feeling, no good speeches, just weird opportunities for big displays of power.  What a waste of good actors who were clearly trying very hard to make the TERRIBLE writing somehow believable.  Sorry, guys, you can't really paint a turd.

Apocalypse, ""I am as far beyond mutants as they are beyond you.""  That's a quote from the awesome 90's X-Men Animated series.  Apocalypse is responding to a human calling him a mutant.  The line is awesome.  The voice is dramatic and perfect.  The idea is epic and mysterious.  And there's so much more where that came from.

What do we get in this movie?  No grand lines.  No consistency.  Just a power-stealing mutant who goes around amplifying the powers of other mutants with no effort.  Sometimes they want their powers amplified, but who cares?  Just do it.  Whatever.  Never mind the grand ""cure"" storylines that are so compellingwhy bother with all that relatability and emotion?  And, oh, let's throw in some new mutants all the fans want to see.  Never mind if they make sense or have any depth.

And...How do you kill this big, scary mutant?  Spoiler alert?  You just hit him with powers.  More powers.  Oh, that didn't work?  More powers.  Sigh...yawn.

No tension.  No emotion.  No story worth telling.  It starts in such a promising way.  I was willing to go along with this new idea of Apocalypse, but there was nothing to go along with.  The story and universe were empty.  No rules + no consequences = no tension.  (Remember the X-Men Animated Series where mutants would wear themselves out because they were using their powers on overdrive?  Yeah, powers just exist.  Using them at full force is apparently easier than breathing.  Nothing is real.)

What a painfully TERRIBLE waste.

All I can say about this movie that's positive is that at least Storm is finally African again rather than American.  In canon, she grew up on the streets of Cairo, not being a normal American tween writing in a frilly diary (like we see in a snap shot in First Class).  While there may be plenty of reasons to have liked the change, she's my favorite character; I'd like to see a proper Storm someday.  But, really, there's nothing else to say.",1479945600,,2465,4.673708920187793

1373614,1,B00004Y56D,"I rarely take time to review films, But I am a fan of thr comic film genre and this once good series has taken such a dive, its worth pointing out, The Xmen prequel trilogy was weak to begin with, saved only by Michael Fassbender and this series 3rd film has followed the original trilogy in lockstep on its road to nowhere.  For a fillm with this sized budget the effects and make up are terrible ,its far outside any Xmen comic canon (if you follow those things), The casting is terrible and the actors are ridiculous many of them clearly phoning this in from a beach somewhere. The guy that wrote the script for this tripe was paid $8,000,000.00 to add insult to injury.  Sony just needs to stop with Comic films as they don't have a freaking clue, This was leagues below the much maligned DC films which say what you want about them but at least they have much more style and were much better at keeping my attention.",1479168000,,921,4.348837209302325

I loved the way they flushed out the characters with just enough detail to fascinate, yet kept the movie going at a good pace. Other X-men movies have had a lot of comments, (and I agree), pointing out the character detail often bogs down the story line. If you've missed all or most of the other X-men movies, it's okay, but do NOT miss this one! Buy if you can or rent if you must, but see it and enjoy!",1479168000,,465,4.065217391304348

1373667,4,B00004Y56D,"Although I won't say that this is my favorite of the X-men movies, I will say that even with this movies flaws, I found it entertaining and enjoyable to watch.  The movie has plenty of good special effects and CGI and action throughout.  I did find that the story was a bit weaker than the others in the series, mainly due to the conflicting storylines from the other movies and a villain that I thought was a bit too easy to defeat in the end with a bit of an anti-climactic final battle.  I would say though that if you are less familiar with the X-men comics, the story flaws won't stand out as much as others have pointed out.  I think it is a bit forgivable that the movies don't quite follow the comics as what movie really follows the books or comics they come from but I would have liked the story line in this one to better connect to all of the other previous X-men movies than it does.  It almost seems like they forgot some of the previous incidents in the other movies and just wrote the story to match what is happening in this one without regard to the other movies.

Unlike the big action movies that I have recently watched that ended up disappointing me, I did find it entertaining to watch even with the story flaws and somewhat subpar villain.

Apocalypse could have been so much cooler with a bit more make-up and CG. Lose the hipster mo-hawks, and put bigger risers in Oscar's shoes too. Fassbender's emotions were forced, but he looks good and he is multi-lingual, so people just like him. Jennifer Lawrence's body suit would have been just as shocking the second time around if her actual nude photos weren't leaked. Sucks for her.

""Captain America: Civil War"", two elite blockbusters. But the fact of the matter is, its not a bad movie. At the
very least. the visuals are spectacular, and the music is excellent. The acting is great in some places: Oscar Issac
is chilling as the villain ""Apocalypse"", and Evan Peters is hillarious in the role of ""Quick Silver"". But the real revelation is
Sophie Turner, who does an excellent job in the role of a young Jean Grey, complete with an impeccable American accent
(which is not as easy to pull off as most English people think!) As an added bonus, Olivia Munn is smokin' hot as a sexy

1373806,5,B00004Y56D,Perfection of a comic book movie. My favorite X-Man Cyclops(Scott Summers) was finally done justice in this badass emotionally driven film. Michael Fassbender did an incredible job with Magneto as usual. Tye Sheridan nailed it as Scott Summers. Nightcrawler was awesome. Oscar Isaac is perfect as Apocalypse. Lucas Till was great again as Alex Summers. James Macovoy was stellar as Professor X again. Everything about this movie is 100 percent perfect. I watched this movie over ten times. I give X-Men Apocalypse 10/10!,1478563200,,520,5.27710843373494

I still have a bitter taste in my mouth about X-men Last Stand and honestly wasn't the hugest fan of FIrst Class, but Days of Future Past was much better.  Well Oscar Issac was incredible as the villain, and all of the cameos (WEAPON X!) and the new mutants (PSYLOCKE) really pushed this film to new realms.  I was more than satisfied and actually really enjoyed the film by the conclusion.

1373898,3,B00004Y56D,"It's a weak and goofy film that rushes through character portrayals and tumbles over its narrative. Also: I liked it.

X-Men films can be absolute garbage and I'll still purchase a copy of each. I love the Mutant Mythology so much that I can often interpret sloppy versions of it (like X3) as charmingly over-stylized adaptations similar to fan-fiction or that comic book adaptation of the X-Men animated series. As a film, however, it fails by giving principal screen time to too many characters and having a convoluted story.

The three stars I've given to X-Men: Apocalypse are for several of the casting choices (e.g. Nightcrawler, Storm, Jean Gray), the visual effects, and fanboy sentimentality.",1478217600,,701,5.086956521739131

1373925,5,B00004Y56D,"Love this movie. The 3D in it is pretty good as well for those that care. I personally love 3D and will only buy 3D version from now on. But it has to be 3D Bluray. Streaming 3D just isn't the same. 3D Bluray all the way. :)

Anyways... I like the story. At first before the movie was released I was hesitant on the Apocalypse character do to how it was in the Comics and how the Trailers showed him, but they pull him off real nicely here in this movie. The story is a nice additive to the series and leaves more opening for future story. It dives more into the X-Men Universe/Backdrops than other movies. At least in my opinion. So I have no problem suggesting this movie to others. :)

1373953,3,B00004Y56D,"Some of the X-Men movies get a little crazy, but I always enjoy watching them. I will say that this movie is not one of my favorites, but it wasn't a bad film. I want to say Sophie Turner did a good job portraying Jean Grey, but I'm scared that I may just believe that because I love Sansa Stark. McAvoy and Fassbender both nail their parts. Of course some of the plot/content doesn't make sense as a prequel to other X-men movies. Wolverine has like 3-4 backstories/memories throughout the X-men movies. Of course X-men fans always love shoutouts or references to famous characters, but again it doesn't make sense sometimes. For example, (spoiler alert) when they run into Wolverine and he saves their butts, and then they bond with him for a brief second, but yet when he comes to the mansion in the future, nobody recalls any encounter. However, I understand these movies are all loosely connected, and it's not a killing point for me, but they use the same actors... why not make one consecutive story. I actually loved the brutality at the beginning of the film and the wolverine massacre. It makes these characters more real, because revolts don't end in 0 casualties like a lot of movies pretend, especially when people are destroying cities. Wolverine is supposed to be a brutal character, so it was nice to see him in beast mode. *Insert thumbs up emoji*",1478044800,,1364,4.66390041493776

Basically you've got Magneto and Apocalypse using the same essential power Phoenix did in X3, tearing everything apart in vague swirly arial displays. You've got Angel and Nightcrawler appearing much older than they would have been in 1983, events of this altered timeline being used to somehow show how Storm and Xavier got to looking like they did in the old timeline, and events that don't line up with the ending of the last movie in the series.

And where was Apocalypse's height?  He was ALWAYS portrayed as being extremely large and very tall.  Brian Singer's ideas regarding X-Men characters and history are horrible.

1374173,3,B00004Y56D,"It's alright, but definitely the weakest of the ""First Class"" trilogy. Fassbender kills it, as usual. Jennifer Lawrence seems completely uninterested in even being there, which was also the case for Days of Future Past, but it's really apparent here. She just kind of deadpans all of her dialog and is just bland and boring. The story is kind of a mess, and while we are often told how powerful Apocalypse is and how he's going to destroy the world, he never really comes off as much of a threat. Even when there are cities being destroyed, it's not Apocalypse doing it, it's Magento. This really feels like it's more about Magneto than the X-Men, which, again, was the case with a previous film in this trilogy, First Class. Sophie Turner is passable as Jean Grey, but I would have no problems at all with the character being recast for future films. She comes off much like Lawrence, just seeming distant and uninterested in what is going on. She also drops the biggest cringe in the whole movie, where the kids are leaving a theater showing Return of the Jedi and she says something about ""the third movie is always the worst"". Had this movie been better, they could have gotten away with that, but it feels like such a weird, hamfisted studio rewrite considering the overall quality of the film.

If you're really invested in the ""First Class"" timeline of these movies, then check this out. Otherwise, there are much better ways to spend an hour and a half or whatever. Wait, this thing is almost 2 1/2 hours long? How is that possible? Nothing happens! How did they stretch this to 2 hours and 23 minutes? I guess I'll give them credit in that it didn't feel like a 2 1/2 hour long movie, so that's something. Oh, and the requisite Wolverine cameo is really great.",1477872000,5,1769,4.562893081761007

To be honest I enjoyed it, it isn't as good as First Class or Days of Future Past but it was an enjoyable viewing.

I do understand a lot of the criticism most of the characters were not flushed out psylocke and storm maybe had three lines each. Actually I'm not sure Psyloke actually spoke at all, she is only on screen for less than ten minutes.

The movie is a further rebooting of the X-Men Cinematic Universe to allow a new generation of actors to play the roles made famous in the first ground breaking X-Men movie. That first movie does not stand up all that well when you watch it today but without it we may never have had all of the great superhero movies that are coming out now.

The film had a nice amount of both humor and action, and I though the character development was good for such a large cast. I think that Apocalypse was well written and played, showing a powerful character who came of age in a time when to have power mean literally being a god; he doesn't know any other way to be. He's not a villain in his own mind, but a disappointed deity who was taken from his world and needs to set it right. Good movie.",1477267200,4,582,4.15929203539823

Most of the movie was set in 1983 which provided a few humorous moments such as the original Star Trek episode being shown on a TV, a few scenes from 5,000 years ago, and a cameo appearance by Wolverine.

1374996,4,B00004Y56D,"It was a pretty good movie.  Lots of action and a bit of humor thrown in on the side.  The only problem with all these sequels is that they don't tie them all together very well at all, which is important, especially if they're going to keep using different time frames in the character's lives.

The problem is that the actors get too old to continue that character's aging role (or they move on to other projects), and rather than letting the character's die off, the greedy folks who own the franchise and want to keep making money on it, get young new actors and start making sequels of the characters at younger ages.  In doing so they end up fragmenting the character's life and making a bunch of mistakes in the process.

If we take the plot at face value, Xavier is more approving of of Magneto than he lets on, and I can't believe that's what what the writers meant to convey.  Xavier doesn't attempt to restrain Magneto in word or deed even after the most heinous acts.  The way Raven was written seems like a more realistic portrayal of someone who stands between good and evil. Magneto is psychotic and needs to be locked up. All of this together makes Col. Striker appear more desperate rather than ruthless.",1476921600,2,631,4.770642201834862

1375159,3,B00004Y56D,"I'm a big fan of the X-Men movies, but this one was sort of boring. The story was too basic to grab my attention and the action surrounding the use of various mutant powers led to some lame encounters. Most of mutants have devastating powers, but they usually end up destroying inanimate objects and rarely hitting anyone. So, you rarely feel like anyone is actually fighting for their lives. I don't understand how this movie sank to such a low quality, the previous iterations were incredible, but were also held up more so by Wolverine.

1375313,5,B00004Y56D,"After watching it a second time, I think I am just about ready to say X-Men: Apocalypse may be the best movie in the franchise. And yes, I know that means I am saying it is better than X2, but I think it is.

What sets X-Men: Apocalypse apart is, for the first time in the franchise, every character in it is represented as they should be. Several had been done right up to this point, but there were always exceptions: Hale Berry was a horrendous Storm, James Marsden, while a great Scott Summers, was never really allowed to be Cyclops, And let's not even talk about Toad or Sabertooth in the first movie.

(slight spoilers)

Apocalypse not only took one of the most complex villains in the X-Men universe and brought him to the big screen, but it also presented a Jean who struggles with control but ultimately steps up, a Scott Summers who gets to unleash his full potential as Cyclops, a Nightcrawler who is just absolutely spot on (even better than X2's, which is saying something), A Psylocke who is just about perfect, a Storm who is truly Ororo Munroe and a fantastic origin for Archangel. It also has some nice touches with the outfits, including Wolverine's Weapon X gear and the straps over Cyclops' left shoulder at the end that are reminiscent of the 90s cartoon version of his character.

As I mentioned, Apocalypse is one of the most complex X-Men villains, and it would have been very easy to ruin his character. This film does not do that. I know it has come under a lot of fire, but I find that most people who know the X-Men Universe agree X-Men: Apocalypse is really good.

I stand by my comment that it may be the best film in the franchise.",1476748800,2,1663,4.439344262295082

1375395,4,B00004Y56D,"A villain with enough power - and chutzpah - to threaten the world; new (to the screen anyway) characters; and some truly amazing special effects make ""X-Men Apocalypse"" a visual treat.
Unfortunately, in my opinion, the writing doesn't quite stand up to previous X-Men movies. The plot is straightforward but the narrative wanders around a little too much. As a consequence, some of the impact of the movie is lost and it becomes preachy at times instead of giving the audience an opportunity to mull over some of its key issues.
That's a shame, again in my opinion, because some of those issues are worth thinking about: For example, do the most powerful among us have the right to rule? Or do average men and women have the right to choose their leaders? Is blind obedience to a charismatic leader healthy for a society?  Where should your greatest loyalty lie? To that charismatic leader or with society?
In previous Marvel movies, those questions - those issues - are raised in clear terms and that makes them intellectually stimulating at the same time they are great fun to watch.. In ""X-Men Apocalypse"" they are not as cleanly spelled out.
That said, the performances of James MacAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence and the rest of the cast are first rate. MacAvoy and Lawrence, in particular, seem to have settled into their roles as Professor Charles Xavier and Mystique very nicely. The cinematography is, as always, well done and the special effects are up to the usual Marvel standards.
The verdict: A 4-star film.",1476748800,19,1534,4.8773946360153255

The Marvel X-Men timeline is all screwed up with the release of ""Days of Future Past"" where Wolverine goes back in time and changes the timeline of all the previous X-men films. Now, in this film, they're all alive and buddies again. Gimme a break.
The character Apocalypse is neither scary, nor a ruthless villain or even truly ""apocalyptic"". He's a lonely ""Mr. Potato Head"";  a loser who got overthrown and buried once already and now got dug up in our time and wants to remake the world the way it was back in his time. Yawn.
For all his power, he could easily destroy all the X-Men, but does not. Instead, Apocalypse makes some of the X-Men more powerful (in order to be his ""minions"") and then the X-Men use that power to kill him. Idiot. Hey! Pass the ""clicker"" - what else is on?",1476662400,5,890,4.36144578313253

Some say that Apocalypse was too simple of a character that created too simple of a conflict. I disagree. The writers cleverly used his simple character archetype as a tool to explore and define the complexities of the other characters in the movies. His simple yet destructive world-domination campaign created internal and external conflicts in other characters that brought about some fantastic character growth.

The costuming and effects were amazing as usual. I didn't see any over-the-top effects that usually get in the way of making a good shot or telling a good story (ie: there were no excessive lens flares, camera shakes, nor dizzying 360 pans).

And as for the complaints about certain characters not playing their original good guy or bad guy role: You're missing the beauty of what the roles changes did to the relationships, the story, and the potential plot twists that we might see in the next movies. I, for one, am very excited to see where the writers take these new roles and the new possibilities that they've opened. X-Men has always been a bit of a social commentary, and now its horizons have been widened to move that underlying purpose in new directions as it continues to tell riveting stories with interesting characters.",1476662400,3,1367,4.883620689655173

I saw X-Men Apocalypse in the theatre and I loved it, so I decided to buy the 4K Ultra HD for my home theatre. Let me just say that it was even better. The story is a great adaptation of the original Apocalypse saga. Of course some things had to change, but it stays pretty true. The addition of a younger Storm, Cyclops, and Jean Gray was a stroke of genius. (Alexandra Shipp,Sophie Turner, and Evan Peters(Quicksliver) stole the show) The action was there. The story was there. The special effects were on point. I don't care what anyone says Brian Singer did good on this one. Of course ther are things I would change (Psylocke was WAY underused), but all in all I LOVED it, and this is coming from a bit of a superfan.",1476662400,69,833,4.180124223602484
1375528,4,B00004Y56D,The actors playing the mutants are awesome. The special effects are superb. The only thing I don't like is the storyline of humans hating mutants because they're different.

The good thing is that it does tie into previous Marvel movies ( Colonel Stryker and Wolverine, Magneto and his still unacknowleged son, how Xavier loses his hair, history of mutants).  The problem was that the villain was too mysterious and weird and he was all action no explanation ( maybe that was he other power).  But would mutants really want to give up all technology to live like the Egyptians of thousands of years ago?

While boasting a stellar cast of actors and special effects on par with any major tent-pole summer blockbuster, this movie falls short.  Here is just a short list of some of the movie's weaknesses -
The script with its trite dialogue and overly simplistic characterizations
Badly paced scenes
Overuse of CGI (this is very common these days)
Much too long.

And my number one complaint about this movie - It's a damn origin story - AGAIN!  I thought we covered that in First Class (a much better movie, by the way).
It's a shame the talent of the actors was wasted in this installment (although I'm sure they are not complaining about their paychecks).

Take a look at Captain America - Winter Soldier or Civil War to see how to do it the right way.",1476576000,,894,4.402439024390244

""A gift can often be a curse"" - Professor Xavier

Four and a half ANCIENT Stars. ""X-Men: Apocalypse"" begins in the Nile Valley in 3600 BC at a decidedly different Great Pyramid, where a form of malevolent transference is attempted but set upon by other sinister forces. Fast forward to the current history, Moira is witness to a strange occurrence, as the ancient and all-powerful mutant, Apocalypse, awakens and has a grand and glorious surprise for the world. It's up to the 'good' mutants, the X-Men, to find and stop him. But Apocalypse has some unexpected resources. It's a recipe for a long, hard, world-wide battle, with some great special effects and with much overlap from previous X-Men movies, including a surprising cameo. This movie is long, but keeps up the pace, although it tries to stuff too many backstories and current stories into one film.

The star-studded cast includes James McAvoy, Michael Fassbender, Jennifer Lawrence, Oscar Isaac, Nicholas Hoult, Rose Byrne, Evan Peters, Tye Sheridan, Sophie Turner, Olivia Munn, Alexandra Shipp, and others. This is another enjoyable Marvel universe CGI spectacular with amazing stunts, outlandish costumes, expansive set pieces, and a storyline that pushes the X-Men (and 'X-women') universe along nicely. Visual effects designed by John Dykstra. Music by John Ottman. Directed by Bryan Singer. Highly Recommended. (Marvel Entertainment, 20th Century Fox, Bad Hat Harry, and TSG.

Which is heart-wrenching, because I'm quite a fan of the X-Men franchise. It's gone downhill quickly in the last two movies, I feel, due to poor choices in some of the actors, and poor story choices. I want to see more of the professor and Magneto. Both actors are amazing and help the films immensely. The rest of the cast really let the film down.

1376534,2,B00004Y56D,"I keep giving Fox chances to make a good movie and each time they fail.  I spoke at length with a friend of mine who is a big comic book fan.  The reason why these X-men movies fail time and time again is that they don't stick to the source material,  they over pay for big name actors (in this case, actress), and they try to cram to many things into one movie.

Let's get started.  ATTENTION! SPOILERS ***

Source material: in the comics, Apocalypse is a seriously bad ass villain.  Hence the name.  He's a world ending event type guy.  BUT that's not his motive,  he didn't want the world to end,  just be to his liking (like most evil villians).  In this movie,  he's some old fart with some neat tricks like controlling sand.  The extent of his powers are never explained throughout the movie.  It's just assumed that he's got all sorts of powers (explained briefly).  Sand manipulation, teleportation, mind control/influence?, force field,  enhancing others with powers are just a few we see.  Yet,  in pivotal moments of the movie,  he only uses certain abilities and holds back from unleashing hell on the X-men.  Why?  Seriously,  if you put all the powers he demonstrates throughout the movie together,  he is pretty much unstoppable.  But he doesn't do anything outside standing still for about 10 minutes while everyone attacks him.  One could argue that his mind was distracted and he couldn't perform multiple actions at the same time ...until you realize that's exactly what he is doing at the big fight.  He's basically tainting Xavier all the while nullifying the attacks of the X-men.

Let's talk about the individual characters in the battle.

Angel.  Never uses his augmented powers to do anything other than break out of his prison.  Seriously.  It's as of he never even got super up by Apocalypse.

Psylocke.  Loses to Beast in a 1v1 fight.  Did Apocalypse even give her any powers?  I couldn't even tell.  That's how insignificant she was in this movie.

Magneto.  Oh where to start...he is obviously Apocalypse best horsemen, yet is the only one not instructed to defend Apocalypse when he needed it the most.  Correct me if I'm wrong but he literally doesn't move a muscle throughout the entire time Apocalypse was transferring himself.  WHAT!?!  OK? And then when he finally decided to do something,  it's pretty much the most pathetic use of his powers.  Well not the most pathetic, but it amounted to nothing.  What he did was on part with what Storm or Scott was doing.  Merely a distraction,  if that, to Apocalypse.

Storm.  She kind of did stuff,  got knocked out of the fight,  than was a bystander until the end.  Meh.

Beast.  They needed sunbelt to fight Psylocke, I guess.

Jean.  Did nothing of relevance until turning to Phoenix.  Sat around while everyone was fighting.  Seriously,  just sat there watching and crying until her big part.

Nightcrawler.  Such a waste.  So he fights Angel twice in this movie.  And both times is basically the same fight.  Them grappling each other and flying/teleportating around in a confusing manner.  He conveniently is absent in the final battle because he probably would have kicked Apocalypse butt easily (if the writers wanted).

Professor X.  I guess the world's most powerful telepath can't beat Apocalypse with home field advantage.  This only reinforces  the idea of Apocalypse being all powerful yet still loses to a cop out.

Wolverine.  Why was he even in this movie?  If you cut out that entire 20 minute portion of the movie,  it'll still be the exact same movie!  A shameless plug.

Quicksilver. About the best thing this movie had going for it.  At least we see him do his thing against Apocalypse and not get written out of the fight scene by the stupid writers.

Now let's talk about why having all these characters made this movie a jumbled mess.  It's too confusing!  If you are a comic fan,  you get overwhelmed by the sheer number of characters the movie throws at you. I didn't even mention Jubilee, Havoc, Caliban...the last goes on. They get introduced briefly,  used as plot devices to advance the story as the writers see fit,  then just tossed aside.

You might have noticed that I left out the most offensive character of all, Mystique.  That's because her inclusion in this movie is based entirely on Jennifer Lawrence's appeal at the moment.  Her role is so forced in this movie,  it made me cringe.  The story tries so hard to make her relevant, but in the end,  there's nothing left to about her character that's important.  Another character who's role and contribution to the story was minimal at best.  She couldn't convince Magneto to change sides.  She couldn't hurt Apocalypse.  I guess she helped by making Storm become good?  Lol, that's all she was good for.  And soaking up 20% of the movie's budget probably.

So then we see how he ends up losing.  Dark phoenix?  Are you kidding me?  Lol, I was about to sit if the Blu-ray when I realized this was the direction Fox was going.  If you are going to use your best trump card to defeat your worse enemy, what are you left with after this movie?  No villian will stand a chance against Dark Phoenix.  They can't make any movie after this one because Jean can just go Phoenix on anybody and end the movie in 1 minute.  And they don't have anyone more powerful than Apocalypse...so what now?  Smh

The decision to include/use Phoenix was a sloppy and lazy one.  It looks like we've reached the end of this movie trilogy since there will only be a let down (climatically).

Fox got it right with First Class.  That movie used...a handful of characters.  Then they got fat on their success and fell back to pre-First Class ways.  Using over 20 characters seems like a prerequisite for Fox in their X-men movies.  Cramming in lead ins to other moves too (like the Wolverine side story).  Unlike Marvel, it distracts from the movie, not add to it.  The audience clearly would recognize Wolverine, yet is left wondering why was he shown if not to partake in the moves final battle?  Of , that's right!  Shameless plugin.

I could go on and on about why this movie failed.  I don't know how much the budget was, but it felt cheap compared to Marvel's movies.  Was the CG done on purpose to look unbelievable?  Granted,  X-men powers are bit more showy then Avenger powers such as laser eye beams and smoke teleportation vs turning big and green or a bouncing shield.  The X-men universe had a make believe, sci-fi feel and look to it.  Marvel's movie looks more...believable, as silly as that sounds.

Overall,  I'd paid $12 to see this at the theatre,  I would have been disappointed.  Instead,  I merely wasted 2 hours of my life with a rental on a sub-par movie.  Any casual viewer would be hard pressed to say they followed the movie without numerous questions.  Fan boys will defend this movie saying it was totally awesome and what not.  But this review was written by a fan boy who saw the movie as a movie and ss a movie,  it should still be coherent, not just fan service.

Also, what was the point of having Magneto ""shake the world"" with his ability to control metal as his part was also just filler. Overall, a time comes when one should consider calling it a day.

I have been of the mind that you can take em or leave em.. this one was good!!! I hate reviews that give spoilers.. so i won't give any. but it features youngling versions of the original cast. Scott, Gene, nightcrawler, etc etc. and of course... as always - Wolverine makes his annual appearance. they could have spent some more time making the plot a bit deeper, but it was good! I did have one MAJOR issue with the movie.. it seems a female from the lifetime movie channel has joined the script writers for part of a major part of the movie. There is a father/son DRAMA, complete with secrecy and ""DUM DUM DUMMMMMMMMM!!!!!!"" moments. even in the face of the destruction of the universe, the son was unable to tell the father that he was indeed, his son. Even though, his entire reason for going on the adventure was to find his dad... I felt like i was watching lifetime a few different times and had to check and make sure it was Marvels X-MEN. other than that - excellent movie!

However, I feel like this was one of the cases where even though there were a lot of great cards on the table. . . no one could figure out how to play a good hand. This movie wasn't bad. In fact, I still liked it quite a bit. But I don't think there is any denying that it didn't have the magic that a few of the ones that have come before it did. It wasn't quite able to capture the emotion that it needed to, the villain wasn't as bad as he needed to be and there were a lot of parts where it just felt a little flat. If you like superhero films and/or the X-Men you'll definitely still want to watch it but I would recommended going into it with fairly low expectations. If you do that you might even end up liking it more than you thought you would. :) Overall 4 stars out of 5",1475884800,2,1013,3.946341463414634

Not in the sense that there was anything wrong with the movie, but more in the fact that it got such bad reviews when in theaters despite being pretty great... Honestly, I was shocked how much I liked it. I've been on the fence about the ""reboot"" movies in the series, but this was great! The only things I could ding it on were a couple so-so effects shots and a couple of the actors/actresses being a bit too diminutive in height for their respective roles. Even past that, they were great in terms of acting and those issues could have been diminished with a few costuming changes and camera angles. This was really pretty great, I'd put it up against X2 as the best in the series any day. The only reason I can imagine it got panned the way it did was the backlash and vitriol from Batman V Superman since they hit theaters in the same window.

I can only offer 1 piece of advice to make your experience better with this movie: Just go watch Deadpool for the millionth time and appreciate that you saved money and have the knowledge that at least Marvel & Fox got Deadpool right.

P.S. Yes Apocalypse really does look as terrible as the internet says, but his acting kinda makes up for it. Like Ultron.

Now I can state that (in my opinion) that it is as good as if not better than both of them. The action is pretty much non-stop but the characters are also people I can care about, which gives substance to the film beyond the usual Hollywood actioner.

The beginning which is  set in ancient Egypt is very entertaining and got me involved with the film right away. I wanted to see what would happen next. I wasn't disappointed. Wolverine even made a brief Cameo appearance.

One more thing. As I was watching this film I kept feeling there was something vaguely familiar about Apocalypse. Maybe it's just me but he reminded me  of Ronan in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"". Same Grey Color. Same Megalomania. Same Bad Attitude...

This is the third xmen movie where the xmen do not exist and only come together at the end of the movie. The formula is getting stale at this point and this movie highlights how overused it is. It would be nice to see an xmen movie where th xmen are a thing but  I guess Brian singer had other plans. If you were expecting the horsemen to be awesome sorry to disappoint once again. It's pathetically obvious that Brian singer has no idea how to handle a black female character. Storm, one of the most powerful and interesting mutants in the marvel world is relegated to henchman status in this film. And if you don't think singer has no idea how to handle a black female character check out his first two xmen movies and tell me what storm does. A character with the power to control hurricanes never does more then create a few wind gusts. Angel and  psylocke are also criminally under utilized. Still not clear on what psylocke's story is. And Angel is just boring. Oh remember those cool uniforms from first class? Those are gone and instead the ""xmen"" find battle armor in William strikers compound. Which is super fortunate and quite the coincidence.  if you were hoping that this movie would connect to days of future past and help make sense of that movie sorry to disappoint once again. Remember when mistic recovered wolverines body from the river at the end of days of future past? Neither does Brian singer apparently because Logan still winds up in strykers control. I don't mind changes from the source material it's a different medium and should not necessarily be just like the comics but when you can't get things straight from one movie to the next it becomes pretty obvious you don't care about the story.

Forget Nightcrawler was first discovered in 'X2' by Charles using Cerebro, then sending Storm and Jean to find and recruit him... Surprisingly, his entire history is told in this movie, fighting alongside all the characters many years before X2's timeline. Forget that Jean was auburn haired and brown eyed as the Jean in this movie is a proper Ginger with blue eyes. Forget we were shown images of a silver-haired Storm as a child wearing a dress, writing in her diary, not as the rebel teen pickpocket with dark hair here. These kinds of things are glaring foibles to the followers of the series and ended up making this movie truly disappointing for me.

If you haven't seen any of the other franchise movies, you'll probably enjoy it. If you've seen ""First Class"", logically this would be second in the series, but once you get to the rest of the series, the timelines won't add up.

Overall the film was really good, not really great, because I wanted more of the grand intros and heroes to the rescue theme that I was hoping for and it didn't happen. I was disappointed that the bad guy was so impossible and hard to kill when Magneto should have been able to do him in painfully.

If you're not all about the fantastical world of superheroes and fantasy, then no, you're not going to enjoy this as much.

In comparison to the PAST X-men movies, it's better and worse. It's better because hello, J Law is in it, along with many more excellent cast members. The visuals are stunning and the characters are so creative. The storyline is a little over-the-top, even for a marvel fan like myself.

1376836,1,B00004Y56D,"While I had long bellyached the quality of all the Fox X-Men movies from the get-go, the last installment finally righted the ship. It only took director 3 films to finally make an X-Men film which smartly married great characters, heavy themes, exciting plot to superb action and effects.

Too bad this film throws all that work out the window with a floundering mess of a movie.

Its hard to know where to begin with the films numerous problems. Perhaps its best to highlight the few bright spots: an intriguing intro, Quicksilvers big scene, some decent effects and designs for the characters.

But wow, this film is stunningly lacking everywhere else. The biggest issue is the epic mess of characters that never cohesively assemble. Not a single character is given an appropriate story, arc or personality, as they are all bland do-gooders. Some of them might hint at a deeper unrest or struggle, but its never treated seriously with only a scant few minutes of screentime for the illusion of depth.

Professor X, Mystique, Magneto these characters are in nobodys top-10 list of favorite mutants and yet they (once again) control the narrative. All have been quite bland characters for quite some time, with the latter two needlessly wrestling with their morals on every outing same as before.

Add now to the mix, Apocalypse who is somehow the most powerful villain ever on screen, while being the most bland and confusing. With the same half-asleep sneer on his face in nearly every scene, the viewer never really understands who he is, what his power are, but more importantly what he even wants. Hes a bad guy sure, but he has several different half-baked plans going on at any one point.

The final nail in the coffin are the drab action sequences. The director uses the same stiff choreography that plagues his other underwhelming movies. Instead of an army of characters tumbling about each other in wild displays of power, the showdowns generally consist of two foes glowering at each other, hands raised, and then special effects flashing inbetween them. Id say its hard to organize a thrilling and balletic brawl between so many forces except that there are literally thousands of examples to emulate from the comics and prior incarnations of X-Men, all more thrilling of a spectacle than this underwhelming failure.",1475193600,2,2330,4.9311224489795915
1376837,3,B00004Y56D,"I am a big X-Men fan, though I lost interest in the comics once they started playing with timelines.  The same can be said of the movies.  I enjoyed the first two, but they tried to do WAY too much with #3, and it felt the same way with Apocalypse.  They introduced/re-introduced several characters in ways that don't jive with the other movies, and it felt very disjointed to me.  There were several details and motivations that were absent, and it left me wondering why the characters following Apocalypse, as they were re-invented, would follow the paths they chose.  It's one of those, ""It was a good movie, but it could have been much better if they spent just a bit more time on the story,"" experiences for me.

plays all throughout the film - a big opportunity missed to do something different...
Also, couldn't stand the actress playing Jean Grey, totally wrong - go back to Game of Thrones!

i love mystique. But they just keep pushing so much effort into her making the same mistake they made with wolverine. The actors dominate in their roles so the studios jump on their characters and run with it even though the roles they play are wrong on so many levels.

Introduction and finally getting to see apocalypse on the big screen was a highly anticipated experience but in the end left you a bit wanting. Angel going through the horseman experience is awesome but still he was an original. They always want to skip him for some reason.

McAvoy always has been able to impress me. He's no Patrick Stewart but definitely fills the shoes amazingly.

They can't ever seem to figure out what they want to do with beast which is a complete shame.

I get why they needed the Phoenix cause who else was powerful enough to defeat this villian but honestly they brought Apocalypse too soon. And this just brings up terrible thoughts as to the last movies screw ups when dipping into such a fan favorite. Honestly they should have waited till deadpool had its cable then crossed him over for the xmen then to battle him. But I get it they figured deadpool would flop (never doubt Ryan Reynolds).

But hey we finally got psylocke haha. Love that character.  Let's see her with pool now.

Over all there's hope.  They've far exceeded my expectations thus far. But it's still one of those franchises that leaves you always worried about when its all going to fall. So far I'm still wanting more.",1474934400,,1645,4.6061643835616435

Enough just enough. This is the worst X-men movie ever.

Story seemed cool in the beggining , but do you know what i mentioned while watching it ?
What the hell is going ON ??? I feel myself watching a bunch of moments with no definitons, the only reason why i write 2 stars is because of my favourite character here Magneto. I loved the way he was getting new powers and ect.
I did not liked the way main ""badass"" character was designed , graphics works were awful. The way he died was terrible, like i though there will be some great moments of his death and everything ended like nothing even happened.

All the actors were great given what they had to work with and the story was pretty good...but I think most (not all) of the characters were under-utilized?  I feel like there could have been a bit more...but I guess that is why there will be another film.

Okay, Quicksilver (Evan Peters)...his amazing scene (semi-spoiler alert) with Sweet Dreams by the Eurythmics as his theme song was classic.  It was the best part of the movie!

Nightcrawler was pretty outstanding in this film along with Magneto.

Yes, who does not love a Wolverine (Weapon X) appearance?  Classic!

Psylocke was fierce!

And then everyone else was more or less good.

Apocalypse...he was good to great.  His followers...I found to be a bit on the boring side (except for Magneto...and Psylocke).  Three of the four followers did not really do much, and were not really effective in combat.  They just followed him around.  There was no real...anything.

All in all the film was fine.  I didn't find it to be as complete and robust as X-Men: Days of Future Past, however that movie is a tough act to follow.  Let's home that the following film will be great.",1474329600,4,1201,4.697115384615385

As a fan of the MU I can't rate this below 3 stars because in the end I know I will watch this many times and even enjoy it a little. But a couple keys to why I wasn't a huge fan of this movie are:

First, Apocalypse felt like a thin watered down version of himself from the comics.
Second, I know there have many Horsemen for Apocalypse over the years but I personally would have liked to see some of the more obscure ones. It's not like it would have made this movie any worse than it already was.

If you have never read the comics this is a great movie and worth watching a few times. This is easily just brain candy and a fun movie to watch on a lazy day even after you've watched it 20 times before.
If you have read the comics say over the last 40 years the character jostling will drive you insane. I really wonder if these directors and producers ever actually read the source material? Sticking to the core and original source material, and back stories would make a good movie great.
I think it's time to allow Marvel to re-acquire these movie rights and take the X-Men out of the good movie category and place beside the Avengers in the world dominating great category this story truly deserves.",1474243200,,840,4.569536423841059

Plus I'm no fan of Brian Singer film or Jennifer Lawrence. Singer is blowing the Mystique character way of of proportion as usual. After seeing it on DVD, I was pleasantly surprised. It has a good story, even though the Magneto story ran its course long ago. Apocalypse's physical presence aside, he was a good character. Plus I think those of use who know the X-Men history are tired of seeing the same characters rehashed over and over. There are so many members of the X-Men that most people aren't familiar with, I think it would be nice to bring different characters for a change.

This movie is the most original of any so far.  X-Men: Apocalypse elicits more emotion and feeling than any super hero movie I have ever seen.  It's the first one that's been released that actually made me feel anything at all.

The world needs more movies of this kind.  Movies that tie in humanity in an interesting and new way.  It's brilliant use of Apocalypse as a God and it's relation to deities and religion was fantastic.  Yes we would be absolutely helpless in this scenario.  We are helpless in real life.  It is a hard concept to come to grips with but it's truth and it's real.  We are luckily gifted with an awareness of just what is around us in our every day lives instead of the past and future that are so far out of our comprehension.

As for it's relation to the comics, this felt like the first time that the characters were actually themselves instead of the people calculating where the funny line goes, where to put the butt shot, and how many times they can use their powers per movie.  Powers were used extensively.  FINALLY you get to see certain characters reach the potential that true nerds and comic book fans always discussed after another disappointing trip to the theater to see an underwhelming super hero movie.

I loved this movie, and you should too.  At least give it a watch.  It's fantastic.  At least, it is to me, a random human being on a computer at 5:22 am writing a review for a movie on the internet in an apartment at the peak of millions of years of evolution and change on a ball of hot rocks floating in nothingness with other rocks around a ball of fire.",1474243200,,1746,4.369565217391305

Theres no in depth focus on any particular story so the climax of certain characters has lost almost all impact. Magnetos big moment would have been great, but by then its been like 30 minutes since his last appearance so you're not tuned into his character anymore. Its the same flaw throughout the entire movie. Same flaw that made days of future past so forgettable. Same flaw that xmen 2 had. Such a shame they didn't give the entire trilogy to Matthew Vaughn. It does look good for the most part. No wolverine doing matrix moves on the statue of liberty type things. Most of the acting is good, which is an insult to Fassbender, whos magneto has steadily declined since Vaughns first class. Jennifer Lawrence is terrible as always. James McAvoy is a rock star and saving grace. The only actor capable of delivering the chills under singers direction. The remaining performances are merely acceptable. Hopefully the failure of this to meet expectations will have fox handing the reigns over to Vaughn. Otherwise i may be giving up hope that someone can pull off the xmen in the big screen.

Seeing storm use her powers was really cool and I just loved seeing quicksilver in action, like always he stole the show. I just wished they would have made Apocalypse bigger. Because in the comics and cartoons he was not slender at all, but muscular looking. But other than that loved the movie, also loved seeing Wolverine's cameo in this.

1377375,2,B00004Y56D,"Not much to be said about this installment of the X-Men franchise. For a visual-effects heavy tale of super-humans, it's functional. But, the plot and the execution is extremely lacking.

If you've never read comic books -- they're well known for ""rebooting"" characters, crossing characters over between ""universes,"" and ambiguously inserting a character (old or new, and if old, irrespective of the character's back-history, or with some lame explanation or revision or insertion of history) when more action is needed in a comic strip plot or bubble or whatnot...

... Same happens here. Filling in the blanks, sometimes lacking continuity. But, it doesn't matter -- it's just an action film. The lack of continuity, and the insertion of characters at plot points gets to a point of irritation. (Opposed to an interesting story or plot to drive character development.)",1473984000,6,870,5.251798561151079

1377377,3,B00004Y56D,I liked it....I love the X Men. That is why I liked the movie. I wasn't thrilled.,1473897600,,81,3.823529411764706
1377378,4,B00004Y56D,Nice addition to the X-Men flicks.  The X-Men have a great range of characters and Bryan Singer does a great job of bringing them to the screen.  I would have liked them to have played up the 80's setting a bit more.  There is a nice mall scene that was cut out.  I think you can find that on youtube.  Look that up after you watch this movie.,1473897600,,343,3.985294117647059
1377379,5,B00004Y56D,"Excellent film unfairly trashed by critics with a backlash agenda against superhero films (which, whether they like it or not are here to stay). Lets take at look at the most commonly used complaints from the critics and bitter 40-year old fanboys living in their parent's basements and deconstruct them:

""There was more action than character development - waaaah"". I love all the films (except the truly bad X-Men: Origins Wolverine), but felt that the action has often taken a backseat to character development in the franchise. It's best when there is a balance between the two, but it's nice to see the X-Men using ALL their powers in all-out combat. The fight scenes are amazing - its worth it just for the end to see Apocalypse surrounded by X-Men hitting him with everything they have.

""There were too many characters - waaaah"". Always the criticism (for all superhero films) I laugh at most. It's not the film's fault certain individuals with limited attention spans and substandard comprehension cannot keep up. These are TEAM films where they usually fight other TEAMs - deal with it.

""The X-Men are too moody and depressed - waaaah"". Mutants are a persecuted minority, which is the main theme of the comics and films. I do not think I would be chipper all day if I was an X-Man. Again, deal with it. And also, there were lots of funny moments from the team - Cyclops and Professor X's favorite tree, the comments after they see Return of the Jedi, etc.

""Apocalypse was a cliched villain - waaaah"". Apocalypse has a simple agenda - the weak must be culled from the strong so that only the strong survive. The ultimate Darwinist,. his agenda is to wipe out most life on earth and rule the survivors. This is about as evil as a villain can be, and Oscar Isaac's performance was perfect for this legendary character, who is one of the biggest bads in the marvel universe. The arrogance, the implied menace with a glance of his eyes, the contempt for most that he feels inferior to him was delivered perfectly. Sorry, this is not a villain/anti-hero you can sympathize with like Magneto due to what he endured in his past - this is pure evil, and most evil is not 3-Dimensional - it's just evil.

I have been a hardcore X-Men fan for decades, and after seeing this I finally felt like I saw the X-Men on screen in their full glory. This includes a very good look at just how powerful Jean Grey is, and some amazing battle scenes. There are still many poignant moments - Magneto's loss, Jean Grey's struggles, Charles reuniting with Moira for the first time since ""First Class"". I liked it enough to go back and see it two more times.

Time will be the final judge of this film, not the detractors, who quite frankly mostly do not understand what the X-Men stand for, or their rich history of characters. I do know what they stand for, and loved it.

PS - Mid-Credits scene lays the foundation for another legendary X-Men villain - Mr. Sinister!",1473897600,,2954,4.604562737642586

1377384,4,B00004Y56D,"I enjoyed the film. It was entertaining. Not one of x men's best but it was OK. I never fully got the villain. Seemed like he was tired and saw doing anything like a chore. I guess thousands of years do that to you. Also, he picked some of the worst mutants as his guards. He even recognizes as much when he sees them fail. ""worthless"" i think he calls them. And yes but... He picked them himself! Seems he should have been a bit pickier if he wanted to declare war against the world. Also, he had already had access to all humans in the world. Why not kill them then and there? I guess he would have found it too easy. Anyways, the part I disliked though was making the stiff girl from hunger games a main character. Apart from her being completely dislikable and a terrible actress, I think they gave too much weight to mystique. She's not really that important you know. Also I think casting Sansa Stark as Jane Grey was a good choice. She's unpleasant just by looking at her, just like you'd expect of Jane grey. Such bland, unidimensional characterization and shallow acting needed that girl to make you dislike the character. Otherwise it would have been utterly forgettable. By the way... Zero chemistry with Cyclops... Another one with zero personality. I don't think these young actors are very good. Only Eric and Charles are making a good role",1473811200,,1354,4.508130081300813

This movie is fine (Franchise wise) if you just consider it a dream sequence and not cannon.

Only real gripe I have with the movie was the CGI/Wire work... it just looks so bad it actually breaks the scene.

Last thought.
I guess the only way to put this cart back on the track is have Professor X mind wipe the world after they get done rebuilding it ... not sure how they will explain all the missing nukes though.",1473811200,,663,4.084615384615384

Apocalypse was daunting in his power and they did an excellent job showing that from not one but two different battlefields simultaneously which was very cool.  I personally love the moment when the younger mutants all considered Mystique a hero and to me she really needed that because she, I think, had set herself and her life into her own category.  When they gave her that recognition it gave her strength and you could tell that it gave her strength.  The ending left me feeling satisfied and ready for the next chapter.  I do wish that Fox and Marvel would put away their claws but that is unlikely.  I think Marvel plans to do away with mutants completely ultimately making them all Inhumans or something.  Back to the movie it was great, I really like it and would recommend it to any lover of action and super hero movies.  I do wish they had given more back ground on Psylocke, the version of Angel we saw and Storm, I always feel like Storm gets the short end of the stick.

I feel like they kind of dropped the ball with him. They didn't utilize that character to its full potential.
Next, I just recently watched the deleted Mall scene.  It definitely definitely should have left that in there. Huge misstep if you ask me. It's easily the best part of the movie and it's not even in the movie.

While that theme is important, unfortunately all of the X-men movies have sung the same tune, which gets tiresome. Also, Singer really has a poor handle on utilizing special effects. The X-men movies always have the worst looking VFX out of all the studios making comic book movies. Getting back to topic, this movie just felt so rushed, it was almost nonsensical.

The only way to save this franchise is if the story tellers are brave enough to go away from the characters played by the ""big name"" actors and to start focusing on building a true ensemble with the X-men team. Even Prof X at some point should fall away from the spotlight. But as of right now, things are just boring and storylines feel forced.",1473465600,2,1155,4.611650485436893

I can deal with the mash up story and Apocalypse being basic, Mystique being the leader of X-Men ? Don't give me the cross over comic stories to support this.

Maybe because I went in with such low expectations but as long as I have been a fan of x-men, I have been waiting for basically this movie. Probably since I was a kid watching Saturday morning cartoons. Let's face it, if you're watching x-men for the plot, you're doing it wrong. X-men and all superhero movies should be about the spectacle, the super-powers, explosions, mayhem, etc. It doesn't have to be more complicated than that. Good guys fight bad guys, good guys win! And this totally delivers. Great fun! Maybe got a bit cluttered at the end. The Phoenix showing up just didn't really need to be there, could have done without it. But a really nice touch with Wolverine. Love the Jean-Logan connection right there. But whatever, that's all fanboy talk. As a stand-alone move, 8.5/10",1473379200,42,840,4.760273972602739

I was pleasantly surprised and I will say I enjoyed this movie as much as Days of Future Past. Apocalypse was a solid villain, who was pretty darn menacing, and how he was ultimately defeated was fantastic. I loved seeing a different side of Magneto as a family man and seeing him turn when he loses his family. I loved all of the young new characters they brought in. Especially Sophie Turner as Jean Grey. That was a fantastic casting. My only complaint about this movie is how Psylocke seemed to get left out of the script a little more than I would have liked. Overall, this movie had heart, humor, tons of action, and a darn good storyline. I strongly recommend this movie, just don't expect it to be Days of Future past. It's not.

He was weak power level wise and he seemed lika mysteriously creeply old loser.all he did was show other mutants how to use their powers better which took up a whole 75% of the movie.the other characters i don't really wanna even talk about...theyre the exact same qay as the las movie....meaning no improvement. On the whole the movie was jus too much of the same.....same ridiculous powers that take up the whole screen so much u cant tell wuts goin on....same  shock and awe when a new bad guys introduced....same rushed introduction to new characters and old.this movie inteoduced apocalypse all too well and the others not enough. I was dis appointed wit this 1 and im wondering if xmen 1st class was the las of the descent  xmen movies. Wut really pissed me off was a high level cillan like apocalypse gettin killed in the movie.they didn't havta kill him....they coulda madit look like he could return but nah they jus merked him off like he was a no name mutant and he was supposed to b the 1st one...almost as disappointing and the 3rd blade movie where blade had to take on dracula and in a chase scene dracula was runnin for his life from blade.xmen apocalypse was pretty damn weak and it really only deserved 2 1/2 stars....a movie i don't car we to see again,1472688000,,1517,4.594095940959409
1377470,3,B00004Y56D,"Its 10 years after the events of X Men: Days of Future Past and our disparate heroes are, mostly, sporting 80s hairdos now.  Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence, again the pivotal character here) has gone rogue (not Rogue), Professor X (James McAvoy, owning it every bit as much as Patrick Stewart) and Hank McCoy (Nicholas Hoult) have begun the vaunted school for gifted mutants, and we are introduced to the new young crop of future heroes including Jean Grey (Game of Thrones Sophie Turner), Scott Summers/Cyclops (Tye Sheridan), and Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee).  A young Storm (now of Nubian origin, played by Alexandra Shipp with an 80s Mohawk), Angel, Jubilee, and Psylocke also show up, among others.  Director Bryan Singer does a deft job of keeping the character introductions free of laborious origin asides, nestling them comfortably into the greater story.

We learn that the first mutant ever (on Earth, anyway), Egyptian god En Sabah Nur/Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac, looking like the love child of Darth Vader and Boo Berry), was planning to wipe out humanity and rebuild the world way back in the days of the pyramids, but a few rebellious naysayers crash his coming out party (damn those early Egyptians were crafty engineers!) and bury him for thousands of years.  His mythology however, has endured, and he re-emerges in 1983, immediately seeking out a group of 4 mutants (his 4 Horsemen).  He recruits wayward youths Storm, Psylocke (Olivia Munn, looking hot with nothing to do), Angel, and finally Magneto (Michael Fassbender), who has been living a shockingly normal un-mutant life as an iron worker in Poland, complete with wife and daughter.

Nevermind all the plot details; Apocalypse wants to destroy the world, and the new crop of untested heros are left to stop him.  The battles are epic, the effects are praiseworthy, even the performances are mostly spirited.  Cities are destroyed (all those critics lambasting Man of Steel for the scuffle in Metropolis really have more of a bone to pick here).  Yet the most fun youll have, again, is the slo-mo sequence of Quicksilver (Evan Peters, again finding the attitude and humor so desperately needed in the chaos) as he rescues students during (yes, during) an explosion.  Its sheer kinetic goofiness and attitude, and a solo film of the kid who can spend a lifetime in the speed stream could be a very cool thing (ahem, those working on the Flash movie).  So whats missing?  The heart of the previous X-Men movies (with the ham-handed exception of the third film) was as an allegory of empowerment for the disenfranchised youth, gays afraid to come out of the closet, and anyone who was different.  Any such social message is largely absent in a more typical save the world plot.
But Professor X does finally lose his hair, so theres that.

This run was pretty fun; can we move on to the Y Men now?

CLICHES: Theres always a cache of leather costumes laying around in an X-Men movie.

1377473,4,B00004Y56D,"I would like to start by saying that critics are WRONG about this movie.  Critics are people with opinions, just like the rest of us.  What they have to say about any movie should be taken simply for what it is...one person's opinion!  With that being said, I also need to say that I'm so fed up with comic book movies being torn apart because they might not be 100% in line with the source material.  Yes, these movies are BASED on comic books, but just because they aren't an exact representation of them doesn't make them wrong or bad!  Now don't get me wrong, there are some things that really shouldn't be changed, and that is a characters background and/or origins.  For example, Storm was never a horseman of Apocalypse!  Things like that, I do have to agree, are very frustrating and shouldn't be done!!  I LOVED this movie, and so far, it's my favorite in the X-Men franchise.  The new cast is outstanding; and while I do feel a bit sad that the original cast's time as Storm, Jean, and Cyclops have come to an end, this cast has breathed new life into the characters!  Alexandra Shipp and Sophie Turner both blew me away.  They are perfect for their roles!  Seeing Phoenix FINALLY done right was one of the most exciting moments (for me) in the entire X-Men franchise!  The only reason I gave the movie 4 stars instead of 5 is because I really feel that the story needs to concentrate and revolve around Storm, Jean, Cyclops, and the rest of the younger X-Men team.  The focus being on Wolverine, Professor Xavier, and Magneto is VERY overplayed and it's time to give these other characters the screen time and attention they so immensely deserve!!!!  Storm is by far one of the most popular and iconic superheroes in the Marvel universe, and yet she has been put in the background in almost every X-Men movie.  It is a travesty, and I sincerely hope that Fox realizes just how import characters like Storm and Jean are, and stop making the X-Men movies the Wolverine, Prof X, and Magneto show!!!!  I hope with all my heart that Fox finally fixes this is the next X-Men movie...which I'm VERY much looking forward to it being a...ahem...Sinister new addition to the franchise!!!!

1377488,4,B00004Y56D,"In order to enjoy the recent X-Men films, the first thing you have to do is completely ignore issues of continuity. These films don't so much ask the audience to suspend disbelief when it comes to their fictional timeline as they ask you to wrestle your disbelief to the ground, lock it in a safe, and catapult it into the stratosphere. The same character reappears in different times at widely different ages, events from film to film are conveniently forgotten, and characters don't seem to age over the course of decades. In X-Men; Apocalypse, for instance, Havok, who joined the X-Men twenty years prior in 1962, looks like hes still in his mid-twenties. Maybe you can pass this off as some good genes, but then why does he have a brother, Scott Summers (Cyclops), whos still in high school? You could go mad trying to diagram a timeline of the X-Men films.

But this wasn't always the way. The X-Men movies are a fascinating example of how superhero films have evolved over the last fifteen years. Appearing after Blade but before Raimis Spider-Man, the original X-Men film attempted to take the sometimes goofy premise of the comics and ground it into something that resembles the world we live in. At the time this enraged the nerd community who were upset that Wolverine was too tall and the X-costumes were too drab. But it payed off handsomely with the general public and helped start off our current superhero obsession.

As time went on and people became used to the idea of people who had incredible powers and silly names and costumes to go with them, superhero films have embraced many of the elements that make superhero comic books unique. Theres less concern about grounding these movies in the real world. Currently, Marvels films are moving towards a match-up between its heroes and an evil man who sits in a throne in the middle of space collecting magic rocks. Likewise, the X-Men movies have embraced time travel and the idea that mutants had a massive impact on important historical events.

Im all for increasing the insanity quotient in the modern superhero films because I think its what makes the genre unique. Sure, every now and again I want to watch a Nolanesque, semi-realistic representation of Batman, but when our characters can shoot beams of energy from their eyes, sometimes realism is overrated. So I don't think Apocalypse would have worked as a villain in earlier iterations of the X-Men films, but an ancient mutant who convinces others to worship him as a God and transfers his consciousness from person to person to obtain immortality seems right at home sixteen years after the first X-Men movie debuted. Overall, X-Men: Apocalypse is overstuffed, overlong, convoluted, lumpy narratively, and the third act goes on for far too long. Which is to say, its a superhero film made in the past five years. Other than these common complaints, Apocalypse is an enjoyable ride that benefits from director Bryan Singers deft eye.

Subscribing to overt Darwinism, the films titular villain has an even more extremist view of human/mutant relations than Magneto, and he spends the film, naturally, threatening the extinction of all of humanity. For the films first half,Apocalypse gathers his four horsemen, soldiers who will aid him in his conquests. But as the film opens, were introduced to Apocalypse in ancient Egypt over five thousand years ago. This introduction plays like a little narrative itself, and one of the my favorite moments in the film is the first shot, which consists of a moving birds-eye shot that renders the Sahara Desert into abstract lines before the camera pans upwards to reveal massive pyramids. The intro ends with the betrayal of Apocalypse by his human worshipers who have devised a way to bury him deep in the ground. The events go by with few words, Singer preferring to tell the narrative visually.

Later in the film, Singer takes a meta-dig at the third X-Men movie, which was hastily directed by Brett Ratner. The well-crafted intro fully justifies Singers choice to throw some shade like a hip-hop MC. My suspicion is that of all the characters in all of the X-Men movies, Singer probably relates most to Quicksilver who had the showstopping moment in the previous entry, Days of Future Past, in which he moved so quickly that time appeared to crawl to a near stop. Once again, Quicksilver saves the day, this time from an explosion that tears apart the X-mansion. Sure, its a cover of an old favorite, but Singer manages to tweak the formula enough to make it just as fun and exciting as in the previous film. As a director, Singer also has similar control over the placement and movement of characters. Quicksilver is a representation of his near godlike power, a comment on the directors mastery of the mise-en-scene.

Throughout the film, Singer brings a real directors vision to the proceedings. As in Days of Future Past, he dabs splashes of primary colors in an homage to the films comic book origins. (Singers interest in use of light goes back to The Usual Suspects where he translated film noirs chiaroscuro into expressionistic lighting). He also makes great use of both foreground and background. Nightcrawler, who like in X2 is a standout character, will often pop into the foreground of a frame disrupting the original focus of the shot. In one particular scene, Magneto confronts former coworkers who have outed him as a mutant only to be interrupted by Apocalypse. When Magento tells Apocalypse, who at this point he doesnt know, not to try and stop him from killing these men for their betrayal, with the wave of a hand, Apocalypse simply melts these men into the floor. These victims who are slightly out of focus and in the background of the shot suddenly and unexpectedly fall to their death. The scene is visually surprising because it makes use of foreground and background and occurs in a single shot where another director would choose to cut. (The use of superpowers are particularly gruesome in this installment,)

While another 2016 superhero film, Captain America: Civil War, easily has a stronger script, there are times when Singers understanding of the visual language of cinema makes the Russo brothers look like they should go back to directing boring old television because they don't quite have the chops to keep up. And about that script. The film is all over the place. Theres a moment where the newly recruited X-Men are captured by Stryker, the U.S. colonel responsible for Wolverines adamantium claws. This detour takes us away from the central conflict between Apocalypse and the X-Men, and in all honestly it seems like these events occur solely for a brief Wolverine cameo.

And while it would kill fourteen-year-old me if he heard me say this, Apocalypse just isn't that interesting of a villain. When reading X-Men comics I thought he was a great villain because he looked cool and was incredibly powerful, but his motivations are mostly retreads of the more conflicted and thus more intriguing Magneto. And the only reason why Apocalypse apparently needs his four horsemen henchmen is because hes named Apocalypse, which, come to think of it, was pretty much the same reason in the comics.

As the X-Men films have become more complicated, they have also become more unwieldy. But theres still plenty to like about the latest X-installment. Sure, it doesnt have the immediate hook of two generations meeting across time like Days of Future Past, but theres enough to set the film apart from the current glut of superhero films that Im curious to see where we go next.",1470182400,2,7586,4.888111888111888
1377489,3,B00004Y56D,"Is there a way for the X-Men franchise to maybe...sorta...kinda...avoid the third movie? Can they skip it and go right to the fourth? The last time they had a third film it was X-Men: The Last Stand, a stinker brought to you courtesy of Brett Ratner.  Bryan Singer's X-Men: Apocalypse is by no means terrible on that level; in fact it's not even bad. It speaks directly to fans of the comic in ways that are amazing at times, and others in ways that are infuriating. But for all of the fan service, the film's overlong 2 1/2 runtime, and minimal plot is what makes it the weakest entry in this latest trilogy.

Set in 1983, which we know from the big hair, leather jackets, and an excursion to check out Return of the Jedi, the film is the logical continuation from the time-altering conclusion of X-Men: Days of Future Past. While most of the characters remain the same, we're also introduced to newer, younger versions of established mutants, such as Scott ""Cyclops"" Summers (Tye Sheridan), Jean Grey (Sophie Turner), and Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-McPhee).  They're part of the new class at the suddenly-crowded  School for Gifted Youngsters, which Charles Xavier (James McAvoy, with hair that makes him look like an extra on Miami Vice) opened to teach the next generation of mutants.

The incredibly slow 90-minute build sees Singer and screenwriter Simon Kinberg assembling various plot threads that might work individually, but there are so many that none are given ample room to breathe. An impressively tense flashback thousands of years introduces us to the immortal villain En Sabah Nur aka Apocalypse (Oscar Isaac underneath all that makeup and armor), who awakens in the present with a plan to make mutants the dominant species. This brings Xavier's former lover Moira MacTaggert (Rose Byrne, not seen since X-Men: First Class) back into the fold, as well as the retired Magneto (Michael Fassbender), who had retired to Poland to start a family.  Mystique (Jennifer Lawrence) has gone off to rescue endangered mutants, but wants nothing to do with Xavier or his school.

The vast majority of the film is spent watching Apocalypse assemble his Horsemen, recruiting a younger version of Storm (Alexandra Shipp), who is still in her thieving days in Cairo; the telepathic ninja Psylocke (Olivia Munn, given nothing to do but look hot in purple spandex); and Angel (Ben Hardy), who has been fighting in underground cage matches. Of all of these subplots the only one of any emotional resonance is Magneto's. Borrowing liberally from his reworked origin in the 2000s, we see that for a mutant like him, one who has caused such death and destruction, there is no such thing as retiring quietly. The outside world finds him, and things go tragically bad, leading to some incredibly poor decision-making on Magneto's part.

There are other moments that work well because they echo events we've either seen in the past or suggest others we're familiar with. The early, awkward encounters between Cyclops and Jean, along with their easy rapport later on, tease wonderfully their future love affair. The same goes for a diversionary sequence about halfway through involving Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) that captures his Weapon X imprisonment, bloody escape, and future infatuation with Jean in perfect detail.  Just as the Chris Claremont-era comics excelled with the soap opera qualities, the movies are best with the little character moments that tell us who these heroes are.

On the other hand, Jean Grey proves to be problematic. It seems that the X-Men writers are incapable of using the character without in some way referencing the dreaded ""Phoenix Force"", which grants her limitless telepathic and telekinetic powers. This time around it isn't just referenced or teased, it's an integral part of the plot, so soon after we saw it used in 'The Last Stand'. The Phoenix should be given a film all of its own to be dealt with, not as one of a dozen other plot threads to be sorted out.

Considering the amount of time spent watching Apocalypse round up his forces, you'd think he'd be a marginally interesting villain but that isn't the case.  Apocalypse is an all-powerful being but he's not terribly impressive here. Sure, he can augment the mutant powers of others, but he does little that makes him seem so invincible. We are constantly told he's powerful, and occasionally he'll show it against humans who couldn't hurt him anyway, but against the X-Men he doesn't seem so tough, making for an underwhelming final battle.  It doesn't help that the basic layout of the fight resembles the last two movies almost exactly.  It felt fresh with 'First Class' but two movies later and one has to consider if it's time for another director to come in with a different approach.

Whereas the prior two movies found ways to have fun with their '60s and '70s settings, X-Men: Apocalypse keeps it serious throughout, which is kind of a drag. The exceptions are Xavier's love-struck reaction to seeing Moira again (and who could blame him?), although the circumstances surrounding that are pretty messed up. Another guaranteed to bring a smile is the return of Evan Peters as Quicksilver, who once again is given his own centerpiece slo-mo action sequence. Set to the sounds of The Eurythmics' ""Sweet Dreams"", Quicksilver's arrogant displays of mutant speed are a blast, even if the effects aren't quite as polished as before.

As a life-long X-Men fan it's tough knocking X-Men: Apocalypse for what it gets wrong, but such a high bar has been set by the previous films that this one just can't measure up. As the franchise finally begins to expand with Deadpool, New Mutants, and others likely to be announced, hopefully this is just a quirk and not an evolutionary dead end.",1470182400,8,5771,4.927909371781668

However, when I actually saw this movie in the theater it was impossible for me to overcome some poor story choices.  There were several cheap attempts to shock the audience in ways that were just ham-handed.  The very worst was the director's decision to show Magneto's young child (and wife) being killed with an arrow (directly on screen).  I have no idea how that scene alone did not push the movie into an R rating.  Just as bad was the scene was fairly contrived.  I can just imagine the director thinking, ""I need to make Eric's descent into to evil to be more believable, so what's the worst thing I can think of...let's drop that scene in the movie right here.""  That scene wasn't the only poor choice, just the worst.  Anyway, I own all of the X-men movies, and most of the spin-offs.  This is the rare title I won't buy.",1469491200,3,984,4.3812154696132595
1377494,3,B00004Y56D,"I have been luke-warm on these films for some time, but this latest is really starting to show that the X-Men films are not moving in a good direction. I love the comic book story of how Angel was made into archangel by Apocalypse. This version was really lacking. The horsemaen (with the exception of Magneto) spent more time worrying about how cool their costumes looked than actually bringing the destruction that had been promised by their leader. Apocalypse seemed, ina word, short. He really didn't inspire the kind of awe and fear that he does in most portrayals.

The movie is not entirely without merit, and I would disagree with some of the bad reviews that point to Angel's apparent lack of wealth as a fault. In the world created by these movies, mutants are on the run and in hiding. I was more disappointed to see Mystique as a ""good guy"" than I was to see a poor Angel. I felt as though they needed an excuse to gert Jennifer Laurence on camera as much as possible (and make her likeable, because JL doesn't do villain too well).

I liked the Magneto backstory. The character is one that is conflicted in many ways, and though I think they took a pretty unoriginal track with that story, it was fun to watch and it showed how Margneto had found some solace and possibly redemption in his new life.

Anyway, This isn't the best X-Men movie. None of them have really delivered the highest level of superhero movie thrills, but if you enjoy the series this one does have some charm, even if it isn't a groundbreaking move forward for the X-Men franchise.",1469404800,,1566,4.5265017667844525

1377498,4,B00004Y56D,"Okay so here's the deal, I'm not going to write a really long review.
Instead I'm going to focus on a few little annoying plot problems that really bother me, so be warned this review may contain spoilers.

Now if you watched the last movie ""Xmen days of future past"", you know that wolverine was sent back to the past to prevent a dark future where mutants were hunted and destroyed by sentinels.
The Xmen were successful but wolverine barely survived and was recovered by Striker, whose eyes flash yellow to indicate it was actually Mystique in disguise.
This should have changed wolverine's metal skeleton and wrote a new future for the character but in this movie we don't even hear anything about wolverine until somewhere in the middle of the film when we see him in the weapon x lab with
Adamantium claws again!!
I mean what sense did that make?
Let's just put aside all the aforementioned plotlines and pretend that Mystique would actually hand over wolverine to the people that caused him so much physical and psychological torture.
Why isn't professor X trying to locate wolverine?
If I'm not bad wrong here, I believe he has a machine called cerebro that he could use find him, I mean wolverine traveled back through time and saved all of them and helped Charles find his inner strength again.
After that you would think that he would be interested in where and how he was but none of this is ever even mentioned.
This was a big cop out, the creators of the movie said to each other ""We can't have wolverine without metal on his claws, so let's just simply forget about all of what happened in the last movie.""
This is extremely disappointing to me, as I was looking forward to seeing wolverine without the metal on his bones.

Also Scott and Havoc being brothers is mentioned once and it feels sort of cheap.
Unless I missed something, I don't recall hearing anything about this plotline before and they just kind of lob it out there at the last minute.

The people that apocalypse recruits throughout the movie just seem to bend to his will for no reason, except for magneto of course.
They're like ""No thanks I'm not interested. .  Oh wait, yes I am."" this is also never explained.
I suppose he does make them more powerful but apparently they are okay with the world being destroyed,  I mean why would a normally courageous and good character like storm just go along with this If there wasn't any mind control going on?
If apocalypse really had that amount of control over people's minds, then why does he need Charles' power?

Anyway the movie's not as bad as some people would have you believe, the overall plot is entertaining and unlike some of the other reviewers, I thought the characters were developed rather nicely.
The scene when Eric's family was killed is sad and I really felt for the character, this also gives Magneto all the motivation his character needs to join apocalypse.

The actor who plays apocalypse does a good job.
He can adapt to almost anything and he makes a truly scary menacing villain.

The ending is very satisfying and pure fan service, seeing all the Xmen working as a team to defeat apocalypse was great to watch.

So do I recommend you see this movie?
If you are an Xmen fan absolutely but if your a casual fan or new to this series, then just keep in mind that it's not a perfect film and you may want to rent it before you buy it, when it becomes available for rent.

Singer doesnt seem to care about anything other than putting magneto through the wringer and re filming the concentration camp scenes over and over.
So when he does a x-men film hes not imaginative in regards to any other characters or themes from the xmen comics.
He really limits the spectacle to middle eastern bad guys in this one.
I was hoping to see some other characters like the living monolith who had a symbiotic relationship with havok. I was waiting for apocalypse to change his form. I expected to see a visually overpowering psy battle similar to prof x's battle with Farouk way back in x-men 118. I expected quicksilver to reveal to his dad who he is, that would have gone a long way to console magneto.
However I saw none of that... My expectations weren't subverted by an expert film maker, they were simply denied.

The film wastes its beginning with the story of apocalypses betrayal, which could have been shown as flashbacks later in the film.
The very pedestrian transfer of immortality scenes uses the same, imagery flowing fluid through an intricate recessed pattern, as Blade, Prometheus etc...

The X-Men must reunite to face a nearly immortal and super powerful mutant who plans to bring on the apocalypse.

What did I think?

At one point one of the characters in the film comments that the third movie is never as good. Its as if director Brian Singer was signaling his surrender. Certainly, this instalment doesnt fail because of its lack of ambition; its just that theres very little new or even exciting. The same aspirational tone of Xavier having the same argument with grief-stricken Magneto? Check. Cameos for the fanboys? Check. Impressive FX? Check. Unveiling new fan favorites of the ensemble? Check (though we hardly explore them at all). A cliched story hanging on hoping for the better? Check.

Its what its missing that lets it down. A coherent, flowing story for a start, and while movies don't automatically need a twist this one sure needed something. The clever layers that set the previous movies in the franchise apart are well and truly missing.

Perhaps the expanding cast and easter egg nods to comic book fans will be enough for some, but, in my opinion, this could be the apocalypse for the mutant franchise. To be fair, theres a degree of comic book movie fatigue around at the moment but it doesnt change the fact this flick is simply not fresh or even very smart.",1468281600,,1316,4.7043478260869565

Magneto brings more raw emotion to a single scene of Apocalypse than anything in DoFP. We have a formidable villain, and an amazing and exciting use of all the X-Men's abilities. It's by no means a perfect hero flick, but it's far more fun and better paced than Civil War imho.
They step up Quicksilver's appearance incredibly well, and introduce some iconic members of the team, like Jean Grey and Cyclops.

1377512,3,B00004Y56D,"So I've been thinking about how to address my feelings for this movie...  Do you remember Skyfall?  It is one of the best Bond movies made in my opinion.  Then came Spectre, a movie that I've been waiting for a long time.  Spectre did not live up to Skyfall.  Spectre should have been the Empire Strikes Back of James Bond movies.  I'll go even further and say that Spectre, as an organization,  hasn't really been fleshed out in film in a way that scares the $%^& out of moviegoers. Spectre as a James Bond movie was in some ways a step backward from Skyfall.  I don't know what they were thinking but it just didn't make sense.  How do you go from the best Bond film to just an ok Bond film?

Now to bring you to what I'm thinking about X-Men Apocalypse.  Good, but not as good as DOFP but could have been the Empire Strikes Back of X-Men movies.  Now with that said, knowing Apocalypse's powers I suspect he isn't fully dead.  If I were in the directors / writer's chair I would take advantage of this and bring him back with a vengeance.... with Darth Vader vengeance.  With Mr. Sinster Age of Apocalpse Cable and Bishop time traveling vengeance with a dose of Lord of the Rings epicness.  I'll go on further to say that the peeps over at FOX owe us an X-Men movie.  DOFP should have been two movies with the first movie giving the fans the no holds barred, post apocalyptic X-Men whooping sentinel ass movie we've been waiting for... and still kinda waiting for.

The advantage of the X-Men movies is that they are smarter than most other super hero movies.  The weakness, in my opinion, is that we haven't seen the X-Men get raw on screen with action like X-Men Last Stand.  While Last Stand failed in story it slams most of the other X-Men movies in action.  X-Men Apocalypse also lost a huge opportunity to address who Night Crawler's mother is.  I mean she was right there on screen standing beside him.  No dream / memory sequence?  We learned nothing of Psylocke's background and she barely got any lines to say.  C'mon Fox, at least try to read a comic or two and tell more of the backstory of our x-men characters.  And no cosmic references to Apocalypse?  We don't get to see the ship?  C'mon Fox, you have the animated series... you couldn't go and rewatch the X-Men cartoons from the 90's?... which I watched religiously when I was younger.  And no conversation between Magneto and his son about their family bond.  I guess they're saving that for the next movie.  The X-Men Universe is being under utilized and Fox needs to let the chains off the X-Men Universe.

So while I enjoyed X-Men Apocalypse as a movie, it wasn't as good as it could have been and spent too much time rehashing what we've already seen and know.  Not enough back stories on our X-Men characters.  And since when do movie makers start bowing down to the public about how many imaginary people die in a movie about fictional characters and tone down world destruction? C'mon Fox don't let these sensitive people punk you into toning it down.  The good thing that Fox has going for them is that the tone of the X-Men is serious and not some action comedy disaster.  The sad thing is that X-Men may never go even a little cosmic, may never go deeper into some characters and may never get to LOTR level badassery.

You'll dig this movie if you enjoyed Blade, X-Men, BVS, The Wolverine, V for Vendetta, Captain America: Winter Soldier, Inception, Jessica Jones (Netflix).",1467849600,5,3457,4.483974358974359

They take themselves very seriously, yet inject quite a lot of humor. To say the least, this movie is quite enjoyable whether or not you are an X-Men fan. With that said, I feel like a review should point out the worst things about the movies; to me, Mystique (played by Jen Lawrence) is used as a protagonist but most people would identify her as a villain. Like the Superman movies, the destruction is quite large, if not larger than Man of Steel. While that is acceptable all these problems/cons are tied with what the movies tried to achieve. The idea was that movie with somehow bridge the storyline with the older X-Men movies; to that extent.. it does not

While James McAvoy and most of the cast do really well.  The direction of the movie felt off.  Bringing in one of the most powerful mutants should have been epic.  However, without revealing to much it was flat out lackluster.

And now that Bryan Singer has directed several X-Men movies.  I truly feel he has tried to emphasize that Wolverine is not bigger than X-Men.  Having Wolverine get demolished, and look like Wolvwrine can hardly fight in his films,  (See X2) or somehow always pushes him to the side in one way or another (First Class, Days of Future Past was essentially a long Cameo).  He tries with a brief cameo to alleviate part of this conception. But it stands.  Which is funny, because Wolverines scene in First Class, and now X-Men: Apocalypse are considered to be the best parts of both films.

Lastly Apocalypse looked very weird.  They could have done much better.  It is quite sad.  And at times, it seemed as if Apocalypse wasn't as big of a threat as he should be.  Perhaps X-Men Apocalypse 2 can address these short comings.",1467676800,8,1273,4.524229074889868
1377516,4,B00004Y56D,"The X-Men films have been going strong for 16 years now, and as evidenced by this year's smash Deadpool, the series shows no signs of slowing down.  I am personally a huge fan of the X-Men, and for the most part, the movies have not disappointed. X-Men Apocalypse was almost immediately on my must watch list; and Oscar Isaac being cast as the titular villain only furthered my anticipation for this film. So the question is: Is X-Men Apocalypse a worthy film?

Well I will confess that there is a lot to like in X-Men Apocalypse. Once again, its the immensely talented Michael Fassbender delivering another energetic performance as Erik Lensherr(Magneto). He does a fantastic job here; there were several scenes where his acting was so powerful I was brought to tears. James McAvoy also doesn't disappoint as Professor Charles Xavier; in fact, the scenes he shares with Apocalypse are some of the best of the movie. Evan Peters not only has another scene stealing sequence, but I'm glad Bryan Singer decided to further utilize his character in X-Men Apocalypse; so that the audience gets to know more about him.

Talking about Apocalypse is one thing; talking about the actor who portrays him is another. Oscar Isaac does a nice job throughout the movie as En Sabah Nur; and I enjoyed how the duration of his voice shifted in certain scenes. His design isn't as close to the comics as I'd hoped, but that doesn't take away from Oscar's performance. Alexandra Shipp delivers a surprisingly nice turn as Storm, while Sophie Turner and Tye Sheridan also fit their respective roles of Jean Grey and Cyclops rather well.

The action scenes are sure to provide excitement in X-Men Apocalypse; and the final battle is pretty exciting. There are also some really cool teasers and some unexpected humor and references that occur in the movie. Early in production, Bryan Singer hailed X-Men Apocalypse as ""the true birth of the X-Men"". For the most part, I'd say he has succeeded. There are some underlying problems in the movie; such as the new additions of Angel and Psylocke not getting enough screentime. Many fans have also wanted to see the X-Men in their respective original costumes; and you do get that in X-Men Apocalypse to a certain degree, just not as accurate as they could be. Mystique's character arc also isn't always as plausible as I feel it could be; whether or not its because her character is portrayed differently in the movie than she is in comics or its a matter of dialogue, is up for the viewer to decide. And despite my deep love for Bryan Singer's X2, and X-Men Days of Future Past, this movie doesn't have near the amount of substance that they do.

And you'd think with those complaints I just mentioned, that that would mean I disliked this movie. Well despite what critical responses would try and make us believe, I still had a fun time with X-Men Apocalypse. It may not be the X-Men movie perfection I am used to, but I do not consider it a bad movie. Whether or not its time for Bryan Singer to hand over directorial duties to someone else remains to be seen, though its clear, that for now, there are more X-Men movies to come.",1467676800,35,3155,4.677477477477478

It is flawed but distinctive, truer to the spirit of the art form it adapts than other equally (or less so) laudable attempts, joyfully made and with as much character as it has characters, a delicate intangibility sorely missing in many fine, more arguably 'perfect' movies made recently.  Also a great and thematically consistent capper to a wonderful trilogy.  Other reviewers detail the plot and their more specific likes and dislikes, so I'll skip all that except to say I was just glad to see my personal favorite X-Man, Cyclops, allowed to do more than just get quipped on by Wolverine while waiting around to be knocked unconscious (or just plain knocked off).

Meanwhile apocalypse builds his odd team of horseman and spends a lot of time posing on hilltops and making armor out of sand.

(which includes the young versions of established characters, although Nightcrawler was an exception) and a completely underwhelming super villain who is supposed to be extremely powerful. Same old themes, especially with Magneto and Prof X, and they were trying to throw in way too many sub plots and characters which detract from focused writing. Even then, the additional characters are hardly used and seem pointless; Angel especially sticking out as such a character. The return of Moira and Stryker for this film was not necessary. There's also way too many 'destroy everything' CGI scenes, which eventually become boring. Interesting that there is a little 'laugh at us' scene, with the characters mentioning that in general, the 3rd film of a series is usually the worst. They could have been referring to X-men: Last Stand (which I don't mind and is definitely better than this), but i took it as Bryan Singer adding the scene towards the end of filming, after realizing that this film was going to be pretty poor. Film was way too long also.

Still, I have to be fair and say something good about this. Well, as seen in most superhero movies these days, the FX are pretty good and the scene where Quicksliver rescues everyone from the carnage is fun and artistic, even if it is done very tongue in cheek (which yes, was the point, but it also adds to the reduced integrity of the film for me), making Quicksliver look like the real near unstoppable force in this film. The start of the film (first 45 mins) showed potential to be another good X-men movie, but went downhill from there.",1467072000,5,1723,4.801346801346801

All the actors were great, they all had their own special time to shine. My favorite scene was with Quick Silver and Yes he steals the spot light again.
The only thing that bothered me, was that Apocalypse kept reminding me of the (1995) Mighty Morphin Power Rangers main villain,  Ivan Ooze. No matter how hard I tried to shake it off. Apocalypse's old ladies eyes, huge Gonzo nose and his forehead needed some sort of CGI redesigned. The way Apocalypse looked, simply bothered me  through the whole film .

I am by no means a superhero fan, in fact, aside from Batman and the X-Men, I really don't care, but as someone who has been into X-Men since he was a kid, and seen just about everything, the day it came out, I really can't understand all the bad reviews and the complaints about violence towards women! This film has been called the worst X-Men film ever, nothing is worse than Last Stand, and as far as violence towards woman goes, there has always been fight scenes and there have always been male and female characters involved, in fact, X-Men has always received high praise for included female characters as equals, since the very beginning, so what is it, they aren't allowed to lose a fight? As far as the film goes, the story was terrific, the action sequences and special effects just continue to get better, and the introduction of Cyclopes (Tye Sheridan) and Nightcrawler (Kodi Smit-Mcfee) into the prequel cast just made everything that much better. Without giving anything away, I will say that my one knock on the film would be in the ending. There was so much build-up around the character of Apocalypse and so much talk about how powerful he was. Half the film follows him as he gains power and puts his plan together, but the final battle, that determines the outcome of the film, didn't take very long at all. There was all this hype and build up to this ultimate battle, that could determine the fate of the world, and when it happened, the fans were left scratching their heads by how quickly it ended. Hopefully it was all done with a purpose, and we'll find out why in whatever comes next, but as it stands now, the ending of the film was extremely anti-climatic, besides that, I loved it!

X-men apocalypse is a great movie that is both finishing character arcs and introducing new characters. The problem is those new characters don't get enough screen time to develop their characteristics because it was putting more focus on the older cast and plot.

Raven is great as she started as a mutant who was dealing with her mutant powers to an avenger of the mutants, and ends it off as the person to look up to as a proud mutant. It is amazing that she gotten this far from where she starts and it is surprising that people hate it because ""she is supposed to be a villain,"" but it confuses me since her motives are not villainous to begin with.

Apocalypse was a great villain that must deal with the reality of human oppressing mutants and is willing to liberate them from this disturbance of the hierarchy system. He wants to destroy the world made the humans since those ""false gods"" are our government and it is true that our rights are being given to the government. His motives are clear and avoids cliche, but it is a shame they pull a Marvel and kill him off.

Magento is the star of this movie and after he fails his mission of mutant superiority to go into a peaceful life, he comes back to destroy the humans because they will never accept him. I was relief that his change of heart came from Charles rather then Quicksilver since Quicksilver and Magento have no chemistry.

1377531,4,B00004Y56D,"X-Men: Apocalypse is another chapter in a franchise that director Bryan Singer setup in 2000, and returned with the Days of Future Past in 2014. It's a heavy CGI action-adventure with bold, effortlessly mixed emotions, characterization, social commentary and mythology that most have come to expect.

With so much going on, it's incredible how the cast of young and old fit so well together. Several returning characters are given emotionally diverse scenes, while new mutants are allowed to breathe and grow as young, vulnerable, yet heroic students. The cast delivers performances ranging from good to great. Once again, Michael Fassbender portrays his intense inner struggle perfectly while Jennifer Lawrence looks and sounds like she would rather be elsewhere.

At a runtime of 2 hours 24 minutes, the pace certainly drags at times. It's to be expected since the X-Men movies are known to be more intellectual than others. Overall, the tone is dark, dealing with heavy themes of loss and inner conflict, yet there is comic relief for all to enjoy. At times the CGI felt overblown, but there is no denying the action scenes are stunning visual eye candy. No shaky-cam or over editing, just intelligent, well framed direction that's easy to follow without trying too hard.

X-Men: Apocalypse feels like an end and a beginning. It ties up what came before with what lies ahead. Bryan Singer and Matthew Vaughan continue to inject fresh ideas with familiar elements, building an unpredictable universe with deep stories, creative visuals and fantastical characters.",1466640000,88,1565,5.2023809523809526

Not to mention that the cage fighting was done by Angel who is freaking rich in the comics. He was even portrayed as such in the other movie he appeared in. Why would he be someone's mutant pet used to make money by fighting? Apocalypse is supposed to be bad ass he was useless here. They did nothing great with his character when he's in fact a monumental figure in the comics. Probably a bigger villain than Magneto. Psylocke is physically supposed to look like an Asian women but she did not. It wasn't a big deal but it was bad casting on top of a nonexistent plot. I usually love the Xmen movies even though FOX doesn't put out the best superhero movies. They just do whatever they want with Xmen, giving characters ridiculous powers with no rhyme or reason.

1377536,5,B00004Y56D,"*This review will contain some spoilers*

I have to say, I tend to award films star ratings based on what they are, rather than on what they are not, or indeed lack. In this case, X-men Apocalypse delivers well enough wonder to warrant a five star rating.

I agree with other reviewers. How the critics got this one completely and abjectly WRONG. You absolutely must see this film if you are an x-men fan; it's astonishing.

The newcomers are wonderful. Sophie Turner makes an excellent Jean Grey (perfect in fact), and although I really didn't think anyone could replace Famke Janssen well in the role, it's happened quite well here. I always said Famke Janssen was the perfect Jean Grey, but Turner is doing great; both clearly emulating Famke's wonderful original portrayal and bringing something new to the character.

Mystique's role is not overplayed, and the villainous aspect of her character that's more prevalent in the source material is no longer missed; in fact, I quite like this Mystique now. Also, make no mistake; her presence does not overshadow the other characters in any way, which is something I think a lot of people were worried about. On the contrary, every character shines quite brilliantly here.

Some of the more B characters don't get a huge amount of backstory, but that's to be expected in such a large universe of characters. This is especially true in a film with this monumental villain, a secondary arch villain, and seven or eight major X-men players, not to mention the core of Xavier, Storm, Jean, Cyclops, Magneto and in other places  Wolverine. So the critics are completely off base there again.

Oscar Isaac's performance is fantastic, and contrary to what critics have stated, his on screen presence is not diminished by the makeup and costume; it is merely enhanced. The sonic affects on his voice create a visceral experience, and elevate the character to really menacing proportions. Apocalypse's design looks perfect in most places. It's not so great in just one or two moments, but it honestly doesn't matter  either way, this villain's transfer to the big screen is truly excellent. His commentary about the iconography and false promise of modern western culture struck a note that I frankly think has gone well over critic's heads. I mean, can anyone name a supernatural villain who actually wanted to launch nuclear weapons into space? Excuse me, but this is pure genius!

The tension between him and Xavier as the film moves forward is riveting. His towering, overpowering presence during the psychic battle is awesome, and his mocking taunts here really bring the character to life  even going beyond the comic book. Jean's eventual entrance into this battle  coming to Xavier's rescue  has to be the most heroic moment in the entire franchise.

Throughout the rest of the film, expect lots of great, explosive scenes, lots of intimate character building moments, and another highly memorable, sweet moment between Logan and Jean (during his excellent, extended cameo), which is truly beautiful.

The emergence of Phoenix, finally, after sixteen years, is more than welcome. It has to be seen to be believed. Apocalypse's last words, ""all is revealed"" upon seeing Jean's power unleashed  this simple sentence is a work of genius, incredibly layered and with huge subtext. It's the perfect juxtaposition between a false God, who, in shock, speaks these words when he is presented after all that time with a young girl who could potentially have the power of a true God.

So who wrote the line? Singer? Kinberg? Tell us!

The scene also really gets to some truths about the original X-men team that were absent to a large degree before. For instance, we see just how close Jean is to Xavier. She is referred to as his 'star pupil' at one point in the Ultimate series I believe, and I think that sentiment was always there in the original book too. They truly have a very special, very unique bond, and it's paid homage to here in a really beautiful way.

This is a truly wonderful addition to the X-men franchise. Can't wait for more.

I'd also like to make a quick comment about the overall critical reaction to the film. First of all, if this film scores 48% on Rotten Tomatoes, and X-men: The Last Stand scores 58%, is this not unequivocal evidence that the tomatometer is a completely defunct and entirely useless object in our culture? Also, I'd like to make specific mention of Scott Mendelson, writer for Forbes, who referred to the film as ""a franchise killing disaster."" I'd like to suggest that this is quite a trite thing to say about a piece of work that took thousands of man hours to make, not to mention a colossal amount of risk.

All this reminds me, personally, that critics are just people with jobs. You can attach the word 'professional' to that description, but it doesn't really change the fact at all.

 It was without question not as good as First Class or DOFP but Its much better than Xmen 3 or Origins:Wolverine and I don't give spoilers but here are the pros and cons

Pros
-Fassbender delivers a incredible performance as Magneto and McAvoy again shows up strong as Prof X

-They actually give Quicksilver 2 incredible scenes this time and the young Xmen are all nice additions.

-Apocalypse is interesting for the first 30 min and had potential.

Cons

-Mystique seems to have watched Hunger Games and decided to shapeshift in Jennifer Lawrence until the final 10 min of the movie

-Oscar Isaac did the best with what he had but ultimately Apocalypse lacked the ability to explain his motivations.

-The movie lacked action and had way to much CGI and was 30 min longer than it should have been

- 3 of the 4 Horsemen made no sense and don't do or say much.

 After seeing Civil War or evem DOFP where they balanced many characters and give them moments Singer didn't do this and while it may seem like im bashing it I am not, still think everyone who likes Xmem should see it and I will buy the blu ray for sure",1465776000,4,1343,4.349397590361446
1377543,4,B00004Y56D,I love this movie. This movie is absolutely enjoyable and thus have very few complaints. One of these complaints is that they messed up on Professor X by making him feel like a bumbling. But most of the characters are well played such Magneto and his son and also Mystique. The best performance comes from the big man himself Apocalypse who feels like a god in every way and form. This movie is good but not as good X-men: Days of Future Past.,1465776000,3,443,4.349397590361446
1377544,5,B00004Y56D,"Some believe that the first mutant was born thousands of years ago. He was some kind of god, and he's going to rise again. Years after the events of the last movie the X-Men members have gone their own way and are no longer the group they once were. Eric (Fassbender) is living life quietly in Poland with a wife and daughter. Charles is still running the school and training new students every day. Things are going smooth until an ancient evil is awoken and the future of the world is threatened. Once again the X-Men must band together to save the world, but this time things get complicated because Eric is fighting against them. After watching Days of Future Past I said that they should end this franchise. The time line aspect was so perfectly done and I felt that any further movie would ruin what was done. I have really like the Newer X-Men movies and even though I thought they shouldnt have made more I still went to see this one. Once again I have to admit that I was wrong. I loved First Class and didn't know how they could do better, and they did with Days of Future Past. This one tops both of those as well. The movie is funny, tense, has a strong grip on reality while still being a comic book movie. The cast is so perfect in this and the new additions are seamlessly added and really add to the feel and excitement. It is very hard for a series to consistently top itself but this one pulls it off perfectly. The sequel curse seems to be missing this series all together. Do yourself a favor and watch this today. Overall, once again, this movie tops the previous one in every way possible. This series is close to as brilliant and classic as Christopher Nolans Dark Knight trilogy.

1377546,3,B00004Y56D,"Some fans and moviegoers are going to like the latest X-flick while it will leave plenty others cold; it will depend on what you're expecting out of your superheroes.  If you want practically wall-to-wall action, new mutants to sink your teeth into, a linear narrative with just enough throwback to the past movies in this franchise, and tons of spfx then you're likely going to come out of this offering pleased.  If you've also been jonesing for less Wolverine and more Cyclops and Jean Grey (or Nightcrawler) then you should be especially pleased.  The story is easy to follow with Apocalypse being explained as the first mutant and as his personhood is transferred from one physical vessel to another he continues to obtain their mutant powers thus making his mutation a smorgasbord of various powers; Apocalypse desires to be worshipped as a living god, just as he was worshipped in Egypt before a rebellion buried him for thousands of years.  Fast-forward to now and he's been awakened and seeks out other mutants to enhance their powers so they can serve as his horsemen and remold the world in his image.  A greater force/ power than his, in uniting with other mutants, is his undoing.  Sounds like the right job for the X-Men.  Fans of comic history (or the cartoons I suppose) will also be treated with some nods to famous storylines (Wolverine in the Weapon X factory) but what they shouldn't expect is an actual ""Age of Apocalypse"" story transfer.  This movie does not resemble that event in hardly any way; rather, it more closely resembles the old X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse videogame if anything.

But if all of that doesn't sound like your cup of coffee then don't bother.  We may care a little about our heroes but they are not significantly developed herein, and the continuously shifting timelines that the cinematic X-universe has been placed in (we are in the 1980s here) makes it confusing and even frustrating to follow.  There is still a strong focus on Magneto and Professor X, which comes across again as rehash, and I for one am wanting something new and more from this series.  I do love the fan service they are offering though; I really liked how they introduced Storm, Angel, Nightcrawler, and Psylocke but outside of Storm they did little to nothing to develop any of these characters.  Apocalypse wanting or feeling like he needs to be worshipped as a god is fine but it would have been much richer if they had him focus obsessively on the Darwinian idea of ""only the strong are fit to survive"" which is a similar but not exact worldview of Magneto's homo sapien superior view--the idea that mutants are supposed to replace mankind in an evolutionary leap.  Missed opportunities IMO.

While I liked the first half a lot more than the second and I suspect I'll like this a bit more on future viewings the overall effect of this first watch was ""it's okay"".  I enjoyed the re-introduction of Storm, Cyclops, Jean Grey, Angel, and Nightcrawler and the introduction of Psylocke (boy she looked stiff in that costume though!) as these characters are almost like old friends but I'm hoping that there is more emotional nuance and connectedness between them the next time out.",1465689600,30,3212,4.78119349005425

For one, due to contractual limitations, it's not going to connect with the other Marvel films.  Two, it's not meant to be ""another"" Avengers film.  Therefore, logically it's not going to have the same feel, direction,  or style.

Many of the reviews I've seen here are complaining about how ""Civil War"" did a better job doing XYZ or how it's not as good as any of the other Avengers films.  I even saw a review complaining about the logic of physics and pyramid schematics.  Guys, mutants aren't real, super soldiers aren't real either.  Since when did physics need to make since at that point?

I urge casual and hardcore fanatics alike to watch this film without prejudice.  I personally went in without bias as an Avengers fan and enjoyed this film thoroughly.  It was action packed and kept me hooked the whole way.  Was it the best comic film of all time? No, but I didn't expect it to be.  It was enjoyable nonetheless.

It seems that big studios cannot wrap their collective heads around the concept of building up the world, first, before deluging it with characters and blowing it up (yes, I'm looking at you, too, Warner Brothers). I mean, seriously, it doesn't have to be world-threatening every time.

This one, in particular, got off to a bad start with me. We open some 5000 years ago in Egypt during a ceremony in which En Sabah Nur, later to be known as Apocalypse, is transferring his consciousness into a new host so that he can take the man's mutant power. The ceremony is being held inside a great pyramid. A pyramid which has been built with a... Look, I'm having trouble even saying this, but it's been built with a self destruct mechanism. One of the great pyramids in Egypt with a, yes, self-destruct device. Seriously.

Then, when it's activated, not only does the pyramid collapse in on itself... The solid stone pyramid collapses in on itself. What? Anyway... Once it had done that, it proceeds to collapse right on down into the ground, becoming completely submerged and blocking it from the sun.

There is none of that that makes any actual sense. Sure, you go right ahead and try to win yourself a No Prize by coming up with an explanation that works, but there is none of it that will actually make any rational sense, especially the part where the pyramid is swallowed by the earth.

We're less than 10 minutes into the movie at that point (okay, maybe 15), and I'm already struggling.

The next major issue with the movie is characters. There are too many and too many of them with no introduction. There's been demand since the X-Movies started for everyone's favorite character, whomever that may be, but Fox has gotten into the habit of just tossing them in without bothering to tell the audience who they are, basically relying on audience knowledge. This is fine under two conditions:
1. The character takes no part in the story, as with Jubilee in Apocalypse. Or any of the background students at Xavier's school.
2. The audience is only made up of fans of the comics who already know all of the background information they need to have.
It's alienating to non-comics fans when there are a bunch of characters running around without any information provided as to whom they are.

That's one of the things Marvel Studios has done exceedingly well, especially since many of their movies have dealt with little-known characters outside of the world of comics fans and conventions, is to introduce characters in a plausible and meaningful way. Even with Spider-Man, probably the character with the least information given about him within the context of a movie, in Captain America: Civil War, there was an appropriate amount of background given to give the character context for the movie.

Fox failed to do that with pretty much every character they brought into Apocalypse, including characters who have previously been in X-Men movies. The introductions of Nightcrawler and Angel were flimsy at best. Storm, given the fact that they've never really revealed any of her background prior, was hardly better. And Caliban and Psylocke were abysmal. And, I have to say, Psylocke psi-blade is not a lightsaber; it's a psychic knife that doesn't have any physical manifestation. (Unless they changed that sometime since I quit reading comics?)

The story is plenty bloated, too. The whole capture by Stryker is completely superfluous to the actual story and is only there so that they can work Wolverine into the movie in a completely gratuitous killfest. That was at least half an hour of the movie that could have been used to further the elements of the actual story. Or cut out completely.

The Magneto plot line is also -- I don't know what to call it -- unnecessary. It provides the only moment of the film with any real emotional content, but, considering where things are left at the end of Days of Future Past, it felt contrived. That would be because it was.

All of that said, it might sound like I didn't like the movie, which is not precisely true. I didn't like it, but I also didn't not like it. It wasn't horrible; it just wasn't all that good. Still, I'd watch it again before Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice any day of the week.

I'm not a fan of the whole re-booting thing, but the X-Men is a franchise that needs to be re-booted and, this time, it needs to start with a plan, lay a foundation, and grow from there. It's too big a universe to keep throwing pieces of it in without laying the groundwork for them.",1465430400,10,4853,4.697647058823529

It's truly what the Flash TV show and Age of Ultron should have contained, and hopefully Flash in 2017's Justice League contains. The classic villain is probably the center of the controversy surrounding the film. Iron Head Studios designed the classic costumes for most of the X-members including Storm, Psylocke, and of course the ending costumes. However Fox decided Iron Head Studios was doing ""too much"" work on the film.

However, Oscar Isaac did a great job with what he was given. The true villain of the film is *shocker* Magneto. Magneto in this film is honestly better than any of the previous incarnations imo. Michael Fassbender was genuinely awesome in his emotionally driven role. While this film introduced a lot of new takes on old characters it also reestablished classic story lines and ""fixed"" what some of the earlier trilogy goofed up.",1465171200,2,1023,5.053254437869822

The pacing is disjointed, the lines are cheesy and predictable (no matter how well delivered), and there are glaring timeline/plot holes. Not just ones that go against the established world in the comics, like the fact that Jubilee (a character they crammed in for no apparent reason and tossed one speaking line to) shouldn't be born yet, but things that have been established within the movie franchise that this film is linked to - like the fact that Nightcrawler and Mystique aren't supposed to meet for the first time until the Dark Pheonix trilogy or that Jean and Wolverine don't meet until the same trilogy, not to mention the fact that not a one of the characters that goes to Stryker's secret bunker/lab remembers being there in their older forms.

They need to concentrate on new characters instead repeating past histories. It's boring and this movie is choppy. Jennifer Lawrence doesn't have the physical presence to be Mystique. Rebecca was a lot better.",1465084800,9,426,5.65625
1377559,4,B00004Y56D,"X-Men Apocalypse was another great entry into the X-Men movie franchise.  I am a fan of comic book movies, but I believe this movie appeals to more than just that.  Its also a great sci-fi or action film.  The movie is predominately CGI, but that is to be expected.  Its not like the scenes in this movie could actually be reproduced in real life.

One good thing about this particular X-Men movie, is that it doesnt take itself too seriously.  It pokes fun at itself, and at the entire franchise.  Much like Deadpool did, but far more subtly.

The cast of characters is very good.  Fassbender and McAvoy play their roles amazingly.  It seems as though Fassbender really feels the emotion that he is portraying.  Jennifer Lawrence does well, though her character plays a lot like her Hunger Games role.

The storyline is interesting, and the writers provide just enough background information for anyone to catch on to who Apocalypse is.  However, there is very little background information for the returning characters.  If you're not familiar with the first couple of movies with these actors, thats ok.  Youll still understand whats going on.  But if you want to understand all the references, youll need to watch the previous two.

Over all, I recommend this movie to all comic book, superhero, action, sci-fi, and CGI fans.  If you go into it expecting what it is, an action packed, over the top movie, youll love it.  If you expect a complex character ark, and gripping love story, this isn't for you.",1465084800,3,1508,4.7528957528957525

I could watch McAvoy and Fassbender till the end of times.",1465084800,7,349,3.4743589743589745
1377562,4,B00004Y56D,"When I went to see Apocalypse I wasn't sure what would happen, considering it was my second time seeing an X-Men movie in theater (the first being Dead Pool which was absolutely amazing btw).  But I'm glad I did see it because I fell in love immediately.  Mostly everyone did a fantastic job with their characters, especially James MacAvoy and Michael Fassbender as Xavier and Eric.  I especially loved Eric's story way more than I did in the first movie First Class.

The only real issues I have with this newer installment to the X-Men Franchise is how they dealt with Jean Grey's character development and the character Storm.  For the most part Sophie Turner and Alexandra Shipp did alright considering it was their first time being apart of the X universe.  But it was like, for half the movie, especially with Sophie's Jean, the writers made her seem like a clueless little doormat who didn't do anything at all.  Don't get me wrong, I love Sophie Turner and she's a great actress.  But I just kept shouting (silently of course) ""Come on already!  Have her do something!""  It wasn't till towards the end when they were all fighting against Apocalypse did they Finally turn her character around and have her unleash her Phoenix side.  Which Sophie did brilliantly of course and completely blew me away, officially winning my heart.  It's just you would think with a character who had so much power would be way more active than they had her being, even with her being afraid to use it.  But I can digress.

The only character I was most displeased with was Storm.  For the whole movie it felt like the only reason they put her in the story was because she was part of the already established story of their older selves.  And I felt like her character slowed the story's progress somewhat too.  Alexandra did alright with what she had to work with, but still.  I think the story would've been completely fine, maybe even better without her in it.  She seemed even more clueless than Jean was.  Thus the problem when you try to add in too many characters.

But anyway, I still very much love X-Men: Apocalypse and will definitely be adding to my collection when it comes out on DVD and would definitely suggest it to anyone who loves the superhero genre and more specifically the X-Men.  On a side note, I can't wait to see what  this Essex Corp. is all about in the next movie where we get to hopefully meet Mr Sinister.",1465084800,5,2425,4.5625
1377563,5,B00004Y56D,"If X-MEN:APOCALYPSE does not quite rise to the level of DOFP it is not for want of trying, for this latest installment in the franchise really goes for the bigger is better style of film making.  From the beginning, many of us longtime Marvel and X-Men fans have waited with anticipation for the movies to tackle En Sabah Nur, one of the mutants biggest foes, and for the most part, the movie pays off nicely.

But it is not without its flaws, starting with a tiring two and half hours running time, mostly because the first 45 minutes or so is all about exposition and setting up the many, many characters who appear, including Apocalypse himself, his future four horsemen, the teen age versions of some X-Men anchor characters, along with catching up with Charles Xavier, Eric Lehnsherr, Mystique and Quicksilver.  This has become a staple of the X movies, where different versions old favorites have to the reintroduced over and over again. Nobody trusts the audience to just jump right in to the story and go with it.  Its nearly an hour into the film before the good mutants and bad mutants begin to move in directions that will lead to the inevitable Big Showdown at the end.  I will say that for the most part, the movie if free of the clunky plotting that is so obvious in other super hero movies-BATMANvSUPERMAN being one of the most recent and worst offenders.

As in all comic book movies, if there is a good villain, then its a good movie, and in this respect, Apocalypse might be seen as something of a disappointment in that hes just another megalomaniacal super villain bent on taking over the earth because hes just better than everybody else. In a lot of ways, he just comes off as a mutant version of Ultron.  But this is where casting is key, and Oscar Isaac gets so much out of the part than was evidently in the script, with makeup that is a dead ringer for the comic book and FoxKids cartoon version of the character. Isaac is able make this Apocalypse truly menacing by using a good actors best tools: his voice and facial expressions.  He truly gets this villains malevolence.  Of course at the end, we get the standard face off with evil, where some of the bad guys have a sudden epiphany and change sides, while the supremely all powerful Apocalypse merely wounds and disables the heroes when he could clearly just kill them outright, but then they wouldnt all be able to join forces and take him down, like weve seen so many times before in other super hero movies.

The best part of the bigger is better comes when Quicksilver saves the students at the Xavier Institute from certain death in an explosion; this is CGI at its best and utterly tops the great scene in DOFP where the speedster rescued Magneto.  It alone is worth the price a ticket, which is due in no small part to Evan Peters, reprising his role from the previous movie and building upon that earlier performance. Another great scene is the caged match between Angel and Nightcrawlwer.

Tye Sheridan, Sophie Turner and Codi McPhee-Schmit are excellent as the junior league versions of Cyclops, Jean Grey and Nightcrawler.  James McAvoy and Nicholas Hoult are back as Charles Xavier and Hank McCoy, so too are Josh Helman and Rose Byrne as William Stryker and Moira MacTaggert.  Newcomer Ben Hardy is Archangel, while Alexandra Shipp easily steps into Halle Berrys shoes as Storm.  The best acting, by far, is done by Michael Fassbinder as Eric Lehnsherr, who perfectly captures Magnetos torment as, yet again, tragedy pushes him to the dark side. The death of his family in the woods is one the strongest scenes in any of the X films. But how many times do we have to see the same sequence where he and Charles have the same conversation over whether mutants and humans can live together and will Eric stay and be part of the solution or just walk away-again.

And its always great to see Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique, who manages the nail the comic book character to a tee.  That Hugh Jackman cameo as Weapon X wasn't really needed, but he is still a welcome sight in what will always be his signature role.

Best piece of dialogue: that dig at LAST STAND.

The good  FINALLY they focus on the team aspect of the comic book instead of just one or two characters. The new additions of a young Nightcrawler and Cyclops were most welcome after their absence from the past two prequels and the actors inhabiting them were excellent. I also enjoyed the Logan/Wolverine cameo, which basically sets up the beginning of the first X-Men movie from 2000.

The bad  (Brace yourself) I mentioned in my review of The Nice Guys that I appreciated the subtle way they captured the era of the seventies. In this film, they patronize the audience by setting up EVERYTHING to make sure we KNOW its the 80s. Nightcrawlers uniform is Michael Jacksons Thriller jacket, Quicksilver is introduced playing Mrs. Pac-Man, and they even go to the mall to watch Return Of The Jedi. As much as I love Game Of Thrones actress Sophie Turner, I feel she was miscast as Jean Grey. In fact, I think there was a lot of miscasting in this film  Storm and Angel, for example. But the worst thing about this film, sad to say (because hes a brilliant actor) is Oscar Isaac as Apocalypse, although its not his fault. He simply was given nothing to work with in regards to characterization within the story. And speaking of the story, Apocalypses plan to destroy the world was supposed to be the main arc, but it was shoved into the background and merely serves as bookends to the already overdone and never ending triangle of the Charles, Erik and Raven conflict. Oh yeah, and I still can't stand James McAvoy. His overacting reaches new heights in this installment!

The bottom line  I liked it better than the previous two prequels (First Class and Days Of Future Past) but it still suffered from the same pitfalls. Maybe in the next outing, Bryan Singer will rediscover what it was that made his first two X-Men films so entertaining and enjoyable. Just my opinion, as always.",1464912000,,2153,4.66490765171504

1377571,2,B00004Y56D,"Incredibly bad.  The only really interesting character, besides Hugh Jackman's Wolverine who makes a very brief appearance, is Olivia Munn's Psylocke, where we get very little of her on screen nor is there any character development.  Psylocke seems to have some remarkable martial arts theme going along that cool purple outfit, tied with her mutant power but we don't get enough of her nor do we see her range enough.

 They didn't even bother to get the 80's right!  Here this film had the chance to really knock one out of the park with that decade's awesome music, from Madonna, U2, Tina Turner, Annie Lennox, Run DMC, Duran Duran, all the way to Prince and Michael Jackson; yet NOT a single screen writer nor director bothered to take the super hero characters we all know and love down that lane!!! How pathetic to waste a great opportunity.

 The film starts out okay with a rebellion in ancient Egypt, from there it flies off into a large mess of a film.  Some sequences and scenes were okay, we see JLaw in an 80's sexy outfit when she infiltrates a fight den in East Berlin to seek out Nightcrawler.

The ""Game of Thrones"" star who plays Jean Grey really is miscast, or plain doesn't fit the character well in comparison to Femke's original performance, and every other younger version of the character also just doesn't work.  The Moria McTaggert character to me is not interesting all, yet she gets a lot of screen time, and then some how they try to condense one of the major plot moving elements into this story by jamming in the ""Weapon X"" secret project mission in regards to Colonel Stryker which is non sensical and now has been retold to us for a third and different set up.  Yet in the end, we are left with exactly that ""Weapon X"" conspiracy military plot story as the ONLY thing interesting in this movie what so ever, even though the film is about fighting Apocalypse.

  The character of Apocalypse is not intimidating at all, not very interesting, looks like a ""Power Rangers"" blue villain and not anything menacing, and then we have Magneto's character dragged through the emotional mud yet again just to turn him evil onto the world (only to later bring him back to goodness for the fifth or sixth time.)  Absolutely not interesting, recycled, and oh so boring.

 Hugh Jackman is the STAR of this franchise, period, NOT JLaw as awesome and as sexy as she is.  Mystique's character is a minor one in the cartoon, yet for what ever the reason because of Hollywood's obsession with ""Katness JLaw"", her character is made to be the most important.  This franchise's legitimacy doesn't work with out Jackman's Wolverine, he is so remarkable and awesome we as the true fans love his heroic character, we are on his side for he represents a brutalized military man who fights for freedom and unlike other campy heroes this guy goes straight out ""Rambo"" mode on his vicious enemies, slicing, beating, hacking, punching, and dicing ""no mercy"" rear end kicking style.

 Quicksilver is a good character, but having us believe he is Magneto's son for some reason doesn't come together as believable.

  This film was badly written, the Army soldiers wear modern uniforms instead of the gear they would have worn in the 80's, not a single element other then Quicksilver's music choices do we see that this took place in the 80's for these producers didn't even bother to make the scenery look anything like the decade other then JLaw's cool outfits.  It looked like 2016.  And why the 80's at all?  If we are to take this story seriously as cannon, then Wolverine-Logan would have been converted in the Weapon X project and had been wondering with no memories from 83 all of those years until we reach the 21st Century to modern times.  Again just terrible writing and NO continuity.

1377573,3,B00004Y56D,"Bryan Singer returns to direct his 4th and most disappointing X-Men film.  In the convoluted and interconnected world of Marvel Comics, this film serves as the end of an era (the third film of the younger generation) and prequel of sorts to the future films.  This film picks up 10 years after the terrific X-Men: Days of Future Past.  Erik/Magneto (Michael Fassbender) has set up roots in Poland, along with his new wife (Carolina Bartczak) and daughter (T. J. McGibbon).  He works in foundry and one day uses his powers to save a man from molten lead.  The workers soon figure out who he really is and the towns folk want him arrested.  The police make a horrific mistake and ultimately suffer the consequences.

While this is going on, the original mutant is seen in flashback.  It seems that back in 3500 B. C. Egypt, En Sabah Nur aka Apocalypse would occasionally trade in his deteriorating body for a new one.  In this case, Old Apocalypse is getting transferred into Oscar Isaacs bodya good choice.  Problem is, a coup is underway and new Apoca is buried under a pile of pyramiduntil 1983 when he is awakened.  When the new Apoca sees what has transpired with Earth after some 5500 years hes appalled.  I guess there were no thieves in ancient Egypt or young women with bare midriffs.  He has a solution however.  With his great power he needs to acquire 4 helpers, destroy the world and build from the remains.

In addition to Magneto  with a side trip to destroy Auschwitz, death site of his parents  Apoca signs up Storm (Alexandra Shipp), Psylocke (Olivia Munn) both of whom acquire some pretty sexy costumes.  Wait, isn't that an Apoca no-no?  Ben Hardy is the final horseman who is known as Angel.  He has wings.

So rather than go with the successful elements of the previous films, that being an intelligent script and an intresting story, Singer goes overboard with CGI destruction.  The usual international landmarks are the first to go, natch.  In what seems like the entire 3rd act, Magneto is floating in the air, summonsing all of the metal in the landand the oceans.  Im not clear where it is all going but we know it isn't where it should be.

One of the bright spots and few injections of humor comes from Quicksilver (Evan Peters) who had one of the most talked about scenes in the previous film.  We see him going so fast the cameras take is that everything around him moves at a snails pace.  But even here, Singer goes overboard with a terrific concept.  At one point, stifling a yawn, I found myself studying Isaacs makeup instead of listening to what he was saying.

The film has some returning vets like Jennifer Lawrence as Raven, Nicholas Hoult as Beast, Rose Byrne as Moira Mactaggert and of course James McAvoy as Professor Charles Xavier.  Newcomers include Tye Sheridan as Scott Summers/Cyclops and Sophie Turner as Jean Grey.  They will pick up the ball in the next installment I suspect.  The film isn't terrible and is entertaining at times but rambles and rumbles on for 144 minutes.  Too much CGI and not enough character development.",1464739200,7,3076,4.66852886405959

And in the end, he does nothing. He's weak, un-intimidating, dull. All talk and zero action. It's like they're afraid to make threatening supervillains, anymore. Apocalypse is probably the strongest villain who does absolutely nothing scary in recent history. It's not even certain if he outright kills anyone of any importance and not just extras. Even his four disciples don't really do anything, making them essentially just an entourage.

Because there are zero stakes involved ON TOP of this taking place in the past, so you already know he's going to lose, there just lacks any tension or suspense to make you care. And that's the one thing this movie is missing. But it's also the most important thing. There's also not even any action scenes in the movie except for the weak fight against Storm and Psylocke and a very brief Wolverine cameo. It's a superhero movie with almost no action in it! This movie needed at least two or three more fight scenes to make it even feel like a superhero movie.

Even the thing X-Men is known for - being an allegory for racism and prejudice - is missing in the film. Also, for those who care, 90's cartiin favorites, like Jubilee, Gambit, Colossus, and Rogue are either completely missing or underutilized so much, they might as well have never been there, to begin with.

This movie isn't extremely bad, but it is missing essential things that a superhero movie requires. Namely, the ACTION and an actual threatening supervillain, not just one who is all talk, but ultimately dies nothing. Everything else in the movie works, but without an actual threatening villain or villains, and without actual superhero fight scenes (more than just one and a half of em, neither one being very good), it just feels like wasted material.

This movie COULD'VE been so much better too, as everything else works! Once again, Quicksilver steals the show. And the formation of the ""modern"" X-Men, like Cyclops, Beast, Nightcrawler, and Mystique work fair enough. But Apocalypse, Storm, Psylocke, Angel, and even Magneto are all wasted, here.

So ultimately, this all just feels pointless. Like making a movie just to make money, rather than telling a good story with a threatening force of evil (who gets defeated in simply the lamest fashion, BTW). This doesn't feel like a story was being told, here. This just feels like another generic release in a franchise. This is like the Call of Duty of superhero movies: bland, generic, very forgettable, and barely worth the time. 4.5 out of 10.",1464739200,11,2831,4.889583333333333
1377575,3,B00004Y56D,"Other than the terrible X-Men Origins: Wolverine and (to a lesser extent) its boring follow up sequel-the X-Men series has always done right by me.  Yes, I even liked The Last Stand (Why does everyone hate that movie so much?).  That's why it's so hard for me to give X-Men Apocalypse just three stars. (Minor spoilers to follow)

I was not excited at all for X-Men First Class initially and I wasn't crazy about a reboot of these iconic characters when their stories had already been told in a such a satisfying way-then I saw the movie and it won me over.  Days of Future Past came next and quickly became my favorite X-Men movie in the series, combining what was so great about the originals with what worked beautifully in First Class.  Before my viewing, I had heard Apocalypse was garnering very mixed reviews and went in with adjusted expectations.  Somehow I still walked away disappointed.

I don't want to be negative in this review.  The reason I titled this review a ""heartbreaking disappointment"" is because that's exactly what it was to me.  It actually sucked to walk away not having enjoyed the third chapter in an otherwise great series that I truly love with phenomenal characters, top notch acting and deep resonating themes.  The truth of it is that Apocalypse-despite having some really great moments, squandered a hefty portion of its enormous potential and quite frankly that really stung.  This should've been a home run.

The most promising aspect of X-Men Apocalypse was getting to see a young Jean Grey, Scott Summers, Nightcrawler and Storm in action, not to mention beefier roles for Angel & Jubilee and the introduction of Olivia Munn's much hyped Psylocke.  The sad part though is that for how great all of these characters were cast and how likable they all are-they're really not given much to do here-poor Angel, Storm, Jubilee and Psylocke especially.  Really you could have cut all of those characters from the film and I doubt it would have even mattered.  Instead-we get another film overly emphasizing Mystique-who in my opinion has already been given her due significance in the other two films and sadly it comes at the cost of a lesser role for not only the newcomers, but Professor X as well which is all kinds of wrong.

Besides under utilizing 80% of its cast-Apocalypse also falters in its pacing.  Parts of the movie are downright incredible followed by other parts that are equally coma inducing.  There seems to be very little in the way of structure at all.  In many ways it was hard for me to accept that Bryan Singer actually directed this film.  It is really all over the place-uncharacteristically sloppy even.  For every emotionally resonant Magneto moment, there is a ludicrously over the top hammy Apocalypse scene.  For every moment you wish to form some kind (any kind) of attachment to Jean or Scott or Storm there's more Mystique scene chewing.  Don't even get me started about character allegiances.  Apocalypse: ""Join the mighty En Sabah Nur and see the world burn!""  Storm, Angel and Psylocke: ""Cool!""  There is also a very emotionally serious moment in the film that suddenly features the obligatory Stan Lee cameo which of course is going to make you laugh.  It's so out of place and it takes you completely out of the moment that I can't believe someone involved in making the film didn't call someone out on this and move the Stan Lee Cameo to a more effective spot in the film.

Apocalypse is not with merit however and there are truly some great moments in the film.  Even though Nightcrawler's role like all the others seemed more like an afterthought-he is always entertaining to me and I also liked Jean Grey and Scott despite the film giving me no real reason too.  As always, Quicksilver is great, but they took what was so good about him in Days of Future Past and they went ""bigger"" to the point of holding the movie up so he could chew the scenery.  There's also a major diversion to the telling of the story so they can shoe-horn in a certain mammal named mutant who really doesn't need to be in the film at all.

Overall, I liked parts of Apocalypse and groaned at or was bored by other parts.  It's oddly fitting that this takes place in the 80's as a big portion of the movie (any scene involving Apocalypse) came off as a really cheesy 80's movie with a hammy, over the top, hyperbole spouting saturday morning cartoon villain.  I doubt very much that was by design.  All said and done, I would watch this again but Jean Grey said it best herself when she quipped, ""The third one is always the worst""-an ironically self referential comment directed at Last Stand but just as equally fitting here.

X-Men: Apocalypse (2016)
Director: Bryan Singer
Plot: En Sabah Nur, a powerful mutant believed to be the first of his kind, rulesancient Egyptuntil he is betrayed by his worshippers, who entomb him alive. Hisfour lieutenantsdie preserving him. Awakening in 1983, he believes humanity has lost its way without his presence. Aiming to destroy the world and remake it,the X-Men are the only ones who can stop him. Cyclops, Jean Grey, Beast, Nightcrawler, Quicksilver, Professor Xavier, and Mystique must work together and come to trust each other if they ever hope to stand up against Apocalypse.

This movie had the bad luck of being released after Captain America: Civil War in theatres as the Russo Brothers handled a spectacle driven, super hero ensemble movie better than Singer did. This is Singer's fourth X-Men movie and while his first three worked because they tended to focus on a few characters despite being ensemble movies, Singer shows that he is not yet capable of handling multiple characters and storylines. Still it is a fun movie with problems, but some memorable moments.

The best actors in this movie were definitely Jame McAvoy as Charles Xavier and Michael Fassbinder as Erik Lehnsherr aka Magneto. They captured every scene they were in and some of the best scenes in the movie revolved around these characters. That's why I thought it was unfortunate that there was very little interaction between the two actors.

The things that did not work in this movie were Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique, the jumbled storyline, and Apocalypse's four horsemen. The studio execs and producers at Fox must've really wanted to sell Mystique as the leader of the X-Men as this movie elevates her to the ""leader of mutant movement"" despite the fact that it seemed like Lawrence did not really want to be in the movie. Alot of the scenes she was in, she was NOT in makeup and playing as Mystique in Jennifer Lawrence skin and it seemed alot of her performances fell flat. The storyline was also all over the place - especially when it came to the horsemen joining Apocalypse's cause. I could see why Magneto would want to join him after the loss of his wife and daughter, and maybe why Angel wanted to join him as he was made to be a mutant cage fighter, but why were Psylocke and Storm drawn to Apocalypse's cause? Apocalypse's motives were clearly stated, but the individual horsemen motives were mostly questionable.

The final fight scene was pretty cool too, as it reminded me of the X-Men comic fights. There is one scene where Professor X and Apocalypse fight their battle in their minds in the mental plane - I particularly nerded out as Xavier and Apocalypse traded blows in the mental plane. Phoenix also lets loose in this movie - possibly hinting at things to come in future X-Men movies.

An okay movie elevated by great performances and cool action sequences that literally seem like they were lifted from the pages of the X-Men comics.",1464652800,4,2983,4.852652259332023
1377579,3,B00004Y56D,"the movie was okay, was not that impressed with the story, graphics and casting. I still don't understand why they cast the bad ass mutant Apocalypse this way when the true comic book design should be have been done their way!! that is one mean looking DUDE but the movie??? he looked like he belonged in those trippy silly awful Power Rangers movies. Come on, 20th Century Studio! You could've done better and given us a wholly better X-Men flick like the last one which totally killed it! this sure didn't pan out well enough to impress a lot of people, that is why. I'd have to agree with others that this was weird and awful to see it demoted down in the series.... Tsk! I only liked Quicksilver and Psylocke at their best.",1464652800,,727,4.432835820895522
1377580,5,B00004Y56D,"PLOT...
Since the dawn of civilization, he was worshiped as a god. Apocalypse, the first and most powerful mutant from Marvel's X-Men universe, amassed the powers of many other mutants, becoming immortal and invincible. Upon awakening after thousands of years, he is disillusioned with the world as he finds it and recruits a team of powerful mutants, including a disheartened Magneto, to cleanse mankind and create a new world order, over which he will reign. As the fate of the Earth hangs in the balance, Raven with the help of Professor X must lead a team of young X-Men to stop their greatest nemesis and save mankind from complete destruction.

Personally I love the X-men series, they get better and better as they go, great characters and fun stories, I love the new younger cast as it works so much better, Days of future past was a great movie and Apocalypse ups the ante once again, a big scale epic action movie that's well paced from the very cool opening sequence right up until the apocalyptic ending! Another good thing about this movie is that it don't have Wolverine leading and stealing all the scenes like he usually does, all the X-men is this movie new and old get great well balanced action scenes! Wolverine still makes a tiny appearance of course and its rather fun! All the cast is great, McAvoy and Fassbender are back and are on top form, Jennifer Lawrence as the lovely Raven (Mystique) Nicholas Hoult (Beast) Rose Byrne (CIA agent) are back, the newer cast is great Alexandra Shipp as Storm and Olivia Munn as Psylocke, and especially Sophie Turner as the lovely Jean Grey who really has a great role especially towards the end, and not forgetting the awesome Evan Peters as Quicksilver who once again steals the show in an over the top funny action sequence. Oscar Isaac plays the Villain Apocalypse really well and is a very cool menacing character, its a really great fun comic book movie that's sure to please most people especially if you love the others, its certainly a much better series than Marvels captain America line up, the visual effects are top notch of course and the soundtrack really drives the movie really well too, make sure you don't miss it.

Make sure you watch until after the credit sequence for a cool scene that sets us up for our future villain!!

1377582,3,B00004Y56D,"X-Men Apocalypse is another decent entry for the series.  Some sequences in the movie are exciting and fun to watch just like"" Days of Futures Past"" but overall I think this movie suffers from being a tad too long.  All of the X-men movies run just a little over 2 hours.  This movie seemed to want to cram too many things into one movie.  Bryan Singer has a winning formula going but I think this film could have easily cut 20 minutes off without hurting the overall story.  First thing I thought of when I saw the young Jean Grey character is whats Sansa Stark doing here?  I thought Sophie Turner did a nice job in the film.  I tend to agree with a lot of other reviewers and think this is one of the lesser films in the franchise like X-men 3.  Apocalypse has its moments but overall does not round out its story nearly as well as Days of Futures Past did.

Any sci fi movie dealing with ancient Egypt always makes me think of the movie Stargate which came out in the mid 1990s.  The sarcophagus scenes and birdlike headdresses seemed very similar to this movie as well as the body swapping idea.

Minor spoiler

I thought Ancient Egyptian opening was excellent and set the premise up very nicely.  The scenes with Magneto settling down and starting a family also made sense and enhanced the story timeline.  How much bad luck can someone have in their lifetime before they become bitter and enraged?  I for one find the Quicksilver scenes hilarious and they add a lot of humor to the movie.  But I don't think the movie really needed to go back to the dam area with all the weapon X stuff from X-men 2.  I think those scenes kind of detract from the main theme of the movie away from Apocalypse.  There seemed to be a lot of worldwide destruction scenes that seemed to drag on a little too long similar to the live action Transformers films which are terrible.  Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique/Raven does a lot of talking but not much action in the movie.  I also felt the Quicksilver Magneto situation was left unresolved.

This film comes off as average which is a shame because in the previews it looks outstanding.  I get the feeling that the director was trying to tie up to many loose ends at the finish of the movie.  Overall I would rate this movie 3  stars.  Perhaps the film could have shown Apocalypse battling more mutants all at one time or not incorporate so many characters all at one time thereby shortchanging other characters.  The movie seems to busy with plot lines going every which way.",1464652800,3,2511,4.439824945295404

1377584,2,B00004Y56D,"I tried really hard to like this movie. I love the villain Apocalypse in the comics, so I was pretty excited to finally see him on film. He did not disappoint. I thought the character was well fleshed out. His power-set was easy and fun enough to understand. The beginning of the film was a wonderful visual romp filled with new enhanced mutants who were cool enough that I thought they deserved their own story. The middle of the movie was a blur of new and old mutants who were from the previous movies ( first class and days of future past). The plot then forgets about everyone else and focuses on the new team of x-men who spend the remainder of the film blundering around and watching events unfild instead of actually helping. After this the plot got thrown into snail mode and slowed down considerably. It keeps this pace until a lackluster end where events are then wrapped up into a nice ending.
Quicksilver, I mean Peter, once again had a great appearance and did a really great job. Michael Fasbender and James McAvoy brought a good performance, but their chemistry was better in First Class.  I guess Bryan Vaughn is a better director than Singer.",1464566400,6,1160,4.576923076923077
1377585,4,B00004Y56D,"Ever since the first movie way back in 2000, the X-Men franchise has been going strong, though not without its ups and downs. And just when the movies seemed to be at their lowest point, the series had a fresh re-emergence with the film ""First Class"", putting almost an entire new cast of young actors in the roles of the characters we'd all come to like. Since then, the continuing story of the mutants who just want to be accepted and save the world has taken us through the 1960's and 70's, and now, with this new movie, we follow their adventures into the 80's.

Ultimately, while I enjoyed ""First Class"" and ""Days of Future Past"" alot more, this new outing is still a decent entry in the series, with a mix of old and new characters and great action.

En Sabah Nur, a powerful mutant believed to be the first of his kind, rules ancient Egypt, until he's betrayed by his worshippers, who entomb him alive. Re-awakening in 1983, he believes humanity has lost its way without his presence. Deciding to destroy the world and remake it, he recruits the likes of Angel, Psylocke, Storm, and Magneto to be his Four Horseman of the Apocalypse. With the world about to end, it's up to Professor Xavier and a band of old and new friends, including Beast, Quicksilver, Cyclops, Jean Grey, Mystique, and Nightcrawler, to stop Apocalypse.

Getting the bad out of the way first, I can understand why many gave this film mixed reviews. Admittedly, the story overall is okay, if just a bit disjointed. With so many characters to juggle--many of them coming from all over the globe--the plot jumps back and forth quite a few times, and even then, it's nothing too earth shattering, which is weird to say, considering the Earth literally gets ripped apart. Part of the problem, I think, lies with the main villain. Apocalypse himself, while immensely powerful, is arguably kind of dull in the personality department. We get no real explanation of why he does what he does, and he seems to just be evil for evil's sake. A few of the characters' backstories, while taken right from the comics, also seem to kind of come out of nowhere (within the context of the movie), and don't really add too much (Magneto's especially. I won't spoil what it is, but his little subplot could've been easily removed). This winds up making the movie a basic retread of all the coolest parts from the previous films which, while not a bad thing, doesn't really add anything either. Even with some new characters joining the fray, they're not given much to do (poor Jubilee doesn't even show off her powers once).

However, with all that said, there IS plenty to like. All the actors do a great job with the roles they were given, and whatever is lacking in plot, it makes up for with the enjoyable characters. Both Quicksilver and Nightcrawler practically steal the movie with their displays of powers and hilarious dialogue. It's also interesting to see old favorites like Cyclops and Jean Grey in their early years, and Professor X continues to develop into the fatherly leader of the team, leading up to an exciting battle within his own mind that, dare I say it, is more entertaining than any fisticuff fight in the ""real"" world. (The ending has some shades of deux ex machina, but then again, how can you beat a character who has the power to do practically anything? Won't spoil what it is, though.)

So on the whole, I'd actually give this movie three and a half stars, but since Amazon can't do half stars, I've rounded it to four, because even though the villain and the plot could've been tweaked a bit, the stuff that's good is really good, and it makes me eager to see another outing with these characters. Hopefully, some of the new comers will get a bit more development.",1464566400,2,3753,4.620689655172414
1377586,1,B00004Y56D,"Graphics weren't too bad, have to say most of them were comprised of sand.  Reason for the one star, personally, for me, was casting first: didn't think the actors hit the role of each character, they can't all be perfect comic reflections, and they will most likely be replaced later, but I think that area could have been vastly improved; Apocalypse himself was tiny.  Second, character background revamps: (spoiler, be thee warned) Angel was a rich kid not just in the comics but is found here as a pit fighter, who loves the hitting the bottle; Psylocke is working with Caliban and is what?  A bodyguard?  She had such a cool background story, hers was totally changed (she was a beautiful Asian woman, but here's she Latina, good looking, yes, but I've seen much better Pscylocke cosplays, she should have been way more sexy); Storm was running around as a little thief in Cairo, but that was after this huge comic story line plot twists which led to the X-Men being made young again, that wasn't mentioned here, by that age, Storm should be in Africa, and in this version, Apocalypse turns her signature hair white...no, no, no.  Cyclops is a little punk, Jean is way to nice, Xavier cries after every line...So Magneto kills a ton of people, then within a year finds the love of his life, has a child, totally new perspective in life then ten years later, they die to he decides to kill even more people, the old, my wife and kid died has been used to death, be more creative.

  Third is the actual plot, was this not the longest introduction ever?  Apocalypse goes in search of 4 generals and finds them in total random strangers.  He spends most of the movie walking and when more then a room's distance, teleporting.  Classic villain wakes up and wants to destroy the world in a week.  I would have liked it if he would have resurfaced after time plotting.  Four, many actions/events seemed to have been put in at random for fans, and I hate to say this, but Jackman is getting old, get a new Wolverine.  They really toned down the Weapon X set up, should have been more grim, more cables and stuff that scientist use, yeah, stuff.

1377587,5,B00004Y56D,"First of all this was one of the most interesting  and awesome xmen movies I have seen since the first class failure began. The way that the movie was set up and introduced showed a great plot and nice graphics. The beginning was a little slower pace to lay out the origins of apocalypse  amd his followers but sets the tone for the xmen to come in. The way the characters are introduced was thought out. Each one comes in in a very intricate way. The relationship between Jean and Scott was really sweet as it wasn't a love at first sight tale but a rather blossoming relationship.
The power struggle with Jean grey  and the phoenix  was uniquely  portrayed.  You felt like you were right there and you could see the conflict happening within her search for freedom and understanding of her new growing power.  The professor had a great role in Jeans power development.  James McAvory had a wonderful return at being xavier. The mansion was shown a lot more as a school for what it was and a place for kids to come and leant to use their powers.  Quicksilver  coming in was a amazing his scene was hilarious  and freakishly  awesome at the same time saving the kids in the explosion.
Having striker com in and wolverine introduced was excellent he came in like a flood tore the place up and it set the stage for his movie coming up. The way nightcrawler was integrated  was cool using his powers and even to the phoenix coming out to save the day against apocalypse.  The whole movie overall in mind was a 90 it had a lot of concepts a lot of potential and great starter for future installments to come.

The best X-Men to date is also the best comic book film since The Dark Knight. Days of Future Past was also good but this one was a superior sequel. The sequence that involves Quicksilver is an absolute blast alone, it itself is better then most full length movies. Then we have the fairly long Wolverine cameo, which was fantastic and brilliantly played by Jackman as always. Overall if you like A. Good sci-fi action movies or B. Good superhero movies, this is for you. Also I'd like to note that Oscar Issac's Apocalypse was creepy as he should be, a brilliant performance as well.

1377589,4,B00004Y56D,"The film opens up in ancient Egypt and by the time it was all over I thought it was going to tie into Prometheus and Star Wars. The film takes place in 1983 with our characters looking the same age as they were in 2014. I guess X-Men stop aging. The first half of the film re-introduces characters and relationships as we get a glimpse of the bad guy who turns out to be a Trekkie watching a very appropriate episode where man rejects the god Apollo and kills him (sort of.)

The film has all the bells and whistles of an X-men production, and anything that has J-Law in a painted blue suit can't be all bad. In their quest for bad guys, there are just so many rogue X-men and aliens out there so they opt to kill Apocalypse who claims he was Re, but also Elohim, the God of the Old Testament. During a time tunnel warp we get a glimpse of a Jesus statue and wonder what the script writers were implying as now the God of The OT is a bad guy who wants to destroy the world (okay maybe He does with that apocalypse thing) and the X-Men are the good guys who must stop and kill him. The theme would be rather controversial if they dwelt on it, rather than just glance by it and allow the uninformed viewer to never connect the dots.

In spite of the X-Men changing history in the last film, there has been no ripple effect going forward. Reagan still becomes President, Annie Lennox becomes a pop star etc.

The special effects are what who would expect for a $178 million dollar production. I was hoping for a better script.

Guide: The old gods aka Apocalypse is bad and must die. J-Law looks nearly naked. Something that sounds like half the F-word was spoken. Wolverine makes a cameo appearance and neither swears nor shows his naked butt for a change. Kudos on getting past that.",1464480000,,1782,4.278931750741839
1377590,4,B00004Y56D,"This film has already brought in a quarter of a billion dollars world wide so reviewing this kind of successful blockbuster has no real point.  But I will toss in my 2 cents anyway.  First, the beginning of the film in a fanciful ancient Egypt would make a lesser film.  Movie magic at the top of both the skill level and the ambition and imagination level.  I would go back and just watch the first few minutes and be totally happy.
  One of the things that sets this film apart from the usual Hollywood movie is the treatment of the leading female roles.  These women are not simply a girlfriend of someone important.  Each of them has her own importance.  Let's look at them.  Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique.  She has no love interest, although Beast  obviously loves her, she wants no part of him.  (Beast is played by the talented Nicholas Hoult.  Part of the excellence and subtlety of his portrayal of their relationship might come from the true life discontinued romance between the two actors.)  In any cased, Mystique is no appendage of a greater, male hero.  Sophie Turner (still playing on Game of Thrones) as Jean Grey has no romantic interest, although there are some sniffers.  New comer Alexandra Shipp as Storm doesn't even have a boy look at her.  New to the series we pleasantly view the quickest witted and sexiest woman alive, Olivia Munn as Psylocke.  She stands or falls on her own, no guy needed.  Finally, Rose Byrne, a woman who would naturally attract male attention, plays CIA agent Mactaggert.  She also stands on her own two feet.  I think some small part of the popularity of this film can be put to the strong female characters.  It doubles our interest in watching the movie.  We have twice as many characters to watch and to root for.  Before you say I am nuts, think how different and how diminished the film would be if these great characters just stood around like Lois Lane waiting to be rescued.
  The special effects are great, the other characters we like as watchers.  All in all this film pleased us in the darkened seats.",1464480000,,2064,4.580821917808219
1377591,1,B00004Y56D,"So, the only thing I can imagine is that 20th Century Fox staffers tried to get the jump on and write any positive thing prior to the opening.  That's the only thing I can think of with this movie getting 4 of 5 stars.  At the time I'm posting this, there's one review saying things like ""Best movie ever!"" and something that looks like some fan fiction talking about love between Magneto and Xavier. Let me be a succinct as I can, I WILL NEVER WATCH ANOTHER SINGER X-MEN AGAIN"".
A wise man once said, if you've got 4 screenwriters, you've got no good screenwriters.  This proves the point entirely.  What Singer did is take one of the most iconic Mutant villains, second only to Magneto, and makes him a generic (insert bad guy here).  Only a slight portion of the original character ethos remained.  Also, Singer felt the need to somehow give the character any power he wanted.
Those of you claiming how Singer is brilliant for taking on ""God is not real"" issue.  I think your Lit teacher, or that activist girl that you're trying to get into their pants, need you.  You should should save that for when you're with them.
What this movie was, is pure a simple.  It's a contractual obligation for those who signed on for X-Men: First Class, and for Twenty Century Fox to sign actors to another 3 movie deal to keep the franchise running.  The story?  Who cares about the story!?  We've got actors to sign here.  Even at that, the casting is so horrible for the newest ones.  The only one that looks salvageable and a good fit is Codi Smit-McPhee, which pulled off a good Nightcrawler.  He was the only good light in a myriad of darkness. He brings Nightcrawlers timid and very pacifist, very religious nature to life.
You should most certainly heed everyone's warnings, and not let 20th century bots dissuade you.  For the screenwriters, your best success in this franchise is when you took a one shot comic, and expanded upon it (X-Men 2).  You've taken one of my most beloved story arcs in the comics and taken in back and given it the Deliverance treatment (For those kids in audience, wait till you're grown up to research that reference).  Your own movie even makes fun of it's self with the tongue in cheek reference of ""Everyone knows the 3rd one is the worst"".  A tongue in cheek reference to X-Men 3 (aka one of the worst movies ever made).  However, I'll point out, since the reboot effort of X-Men First Class... Oh what do you know, it's the 3rd movie in that arc.  I'm glad you guys knew how horrible it was when writing it.",1464480000,24,2538,4.473913043478261
1377592,4,B00004Y56D,"Nine Things About the Movie ""X-Men: Apocalypse""

1. This is the ninth movie in the X-Men Universe (if you count ""Deadpool""). It's the sixth movie about the X-Men group, and the fourth movie in chronological order, at least according to one timeline that may have deleted some of the other movies. Yes, it's all very confusing.

Anyway, if you've at least seen ""X-Men: First Class"", you should have enough background for this movie to make sense. Mostly.

2. This is the 4th X-Men movie directed by Bryan Singer, and he admits he made the series complicated on purpose. He really likes to mess with the concept of time and fate and destiny (Singer himself has called several of the movies ""in-betweenquels""). He refers to time as a river, that can branch off in different directions, and sometimes rejoin itself in a different place. He illustrates that in the X-Men movies.

3. After directly tackling the paradoxes of time travel, Singer takes on bigger topics here. This film is about the world's first mutant, En Sabah Nur. He's known affectionately as Apocalypse. It turns out that all throughout human history, what people have always thought of as God was really En Sabah Nur, as he gained power through the millenia.

Did you catch that? God is really a mutant human. He has returned now to gather four followers and actually end the world. Of course, other mutants try to stop him.

4. This is a superhero movie, so of course there are some plot holes. But not as many as you might expect. Singer has done such a good job of constructing an alternate version of Earth (or multiple versions, whatever), that it mostly works. You can believe that these over-powered mutant humans are struggling to find their place in society.

5. There's hardly any blood in this movie, but there is a lot of violence. A lot of people die. And it's not just the ""bad guy"" that murders people.

6. The movie is both smart and smart-ass; writer Simon Kinberg gets props for the script (he also wrote Jumper, Sherlock Holmes, and the upcoming Logan's Run remake). There are fun scenes such as when Peter saves a lot of people in a building while it's exploding. But they interlock with darker scenes about death, revenge, God, and depression (it's interesting that the angel mutant is apparently an alcoholic).

7.  This movie actually lives up to its name. When other films talk about civil wars that are really just street fights, this movie brings the epic feel of total destruction. And we finally have a super-villain that's worthy of the name.

8.  From the very first scene, the movie is visually awesome. It's a gorgeously rendered world that is amazing to watch, even if you don't like the story.

9.  More and more mainstream audiences are suffering from what's called ""superhero fatigue"". They recognize that most superhero movies are basically the same, and there's just too damn many of them. So I can understand if some people find this film to be another example of that. But I disagree. This movie proves that over-told stories can still work, if they are handled correctly.",1464480000,4,3077,4.74859287054409
1377593,5,B00004Y56D,"Ive been a fan of the X-Men since I was ten-years-old. I was introduced to the X-Men by my classmates on the playground, and later by the 90s cartoon, episode, The Unstoppable Juggernaut. Since then, Ive collected the comics, drawn hundreds of drawings (check them out at [...], memorized every moment in each animated interpretation, and faithfully watched each movie multiple times in the theaters (and countless times on home video)... and enjoyed them... for the most part.
That being said, I was really disturbed by the mixed reviews for X-Men: Apocalypse. I felt Bryan Singer in the past has nailed the movie interpretations. I mean, I literally had tunnel vision when I left the theater after X2: X-Men United. How could he have gotten this one wrong?
After seeing the film, I can tell you for a fact that the negative reviews for the film are greatly exaggerated. Is it a perfect movie? Not at all. Is it the best X-Men movie? Nope. But it is up there. I think Rotten Tomatoes has especially lost all credibility. Batman v Superman currently has a 27%. Really?! That movie had its problems, but a 27%? I don't think so. Negative reviews for big blockbusters attract clicks, and views, and everything websites and YouTubers want to bring in an audience to them for people to see if they would be wasting their money seeing a movie in theaters.
Lets run through what I thought about the film and let me know in the comments if you agree or disagree. My thoughts aren't in chronological order, so sorry, Ill be a little everywhere on this one. Be warned, this review will contain spoilers.
Storms hair... Where do I begin on this one. I was hoping she was dying her hair dark to fit in a little more so people didn't notice her while she was trying to steal. Unfortunately, they didn't go with that route. And Apocalypse giving her her signature white hair raised a red flag concerning the continuity of the X-Men movies, but more on that later.
Apocalypse, though threatening and scary at times, unfortunately you could tell Oscar Isaac was having trouble moving in his rubber suit. I honestly think the character should have just been a CGI character. Oscars height did bother me. In the comics, Apocalypse is able to change his height, but his default height is like 9 tall, making him all the more threatening. I was sadden to see Apocalypse only be huge in stature on the psychic plane.
One of my favorite moments of the film was Wolverines cameo. It was glorious! But there were times where you could tell that even though it was a bit violent compared to other X-Men movies, that Hugh was holding back. I felt he couldve gone more feral. And that jump he did you could totally tell was with a wire. Hoping Wolverine 3 will let us see a Wolverine that totally cuts loose.
Another part of the movie I enjoyed was Quicksilver. The scene where hes saving all the people inside the building was a lot of fun and hilarious. I honestly didn't even noticed that he missed Havok (R.I.P.). Not really sure how Magneto will react when he finds out that hes his son, but hope it gets talked about soon. No need to drag that out when they should really be discussing Nightcrawler being Mystiques son, that is if they decide to bring Jennifer Lawrence back.
Speaking of which, Im glad they explained why Mystique wasn't blue in the film. And I bought the explanation, even though we all know that its because Jennifer Lawrence just doesnt want to go through the makeup process anymore. I get that, I really do, but did you hear Rebecca Romijn complain that much about it to the point they wrote an explanation why shes in a different form when she doesnt need to be? Rebecca was a pro, and a damn good Mystique. I honestly was wishing theyd kill off Mystique in this movie, and just filmed that scene with her in the Danger Room with the other X-Men to throw us off the trail. Though, if they did kill her off, thatd probably torch the idea of Rebecca Romijn ever coming back as the character in future movies.
Sophie Turner was the best choice for Jean Grey, and Im glad Singer was smart enough to listen to the fans on this one. She nailed Jeans innocence and struggle. I was clapping when we FINALLY got to see the fiery Phoenix bird, something hinted at in X2, but ignored in X-Men: The Last Stand. Definitely looking forward to seeing more of her in future X-Men films.
I know the 80s were a different time, but Xavier was making me a little nervous when he hopped out of his wheelchair and into Jeans bed after having a nightmare that woke the whole school. Luckily Hank was there, but still. There should be boundaries between a teacher and student. I know for awhile they were playing with the idea of Xavier having feelings for Jean in the comics, but thats just creepy. I guess its no creepier than Wolverine whos nearing his 200th birthday to have feelings for her.
One of the things that also bothered me about Xavier is that hes suddenly taken by Moira. And why did he decide to give her her thoughts back from X-Men: First Class at that moment. Youd think that wouldve been a private moment between just the two of them. I don't know. I just don't see any natural romantic interest between Xavier and Moria. Now Xavier and Magneto on the other hand... just rewatch First Class with the mindset that Xavier and Magneto are lovers, and youll see true romance there.
Ever since X-Men Origins: Wolverine, the X-Men movies have had a hard time locking in a true continuity. Unfortunately, this movie doesnt help that issue, and has brought up more questions than answers, especially concerning the first trilogy. If Apocalypse was sought out because of the events of 73, which only happened because of Wolverine traveling to the past, how did Storm get her white hair then in the first timeline? And for that matter, how did Professor X become bald in the first timeline? Since Jean gave Wolverine that memory of his name, Logan, how did he get that from the first time around? But more importantly, why does no one comment on Xaviers new look?
It may seem like Im ripping this movie a new one, but overall, I greatly enjoyed the film. I honestly just wish it was longer. Its not my favorite X-Men movie, but if I had to rank it, Id put it right behind X2, which follows X-Men: Days of Future Past. I think mainly the bad reviews may be originating from the fact that this is a high stakes movie when the X-Men movies are usually more grounded, so most people may just not be expecting that.
If your questioning whether or not to see this film, I definitely recommend it, especially in the movie theater. I give this movie an 88/100.

1377594,5,B00004Y56D,"The X-Men film series has become quite the long running franchise and with any long running franchise there are highs and lows. Despite some of the lows, or perhaps because of them, the filmmakers attached to this franchise have clearly been making a redoubled effort to turn out films that will tell exciting stories and please fans. They've been on a good run, too. The last several films, First Class, The Wolverine, Days of Future Past, and Deadpool have all been excellent entries in my opinion. X-Men: Apocalypse is made with the same intentions and while it doesn't quite hit the high water mark of Days of Future Past, it's an exciting, worthwhile, and fun entry into the franchise. The filmmakers are clearly enthused about what they're doing here and the film successfully builds off of the narrative begun in First Class and continued in Days of Future Past. While the film is not without some flaws (the pacing in the first act is a bit too frantic and some of the secondary characters don't get much development) it has a strong second half that brings together its many plot threads into a finale that I found dramatic and satisfying. There's a lot to enjoy here, including strong work with Michael Fassbender's Magneto, who has been a high point of every film he's appeared in so far, as well another show stealing scene with Quicksilver and one or two surprise cameos that I won't spoil but which are high points of the whole film series.

While not perfect, this is a good entry in the franchise and I'm already looking forward to the next.",1464393600,5,1557,4.682481751824818
