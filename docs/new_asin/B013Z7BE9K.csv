8729233,5,B013Z7BE9K,"4.5 stars.  Exquisite musicianship, well recorded, from the outstanding French ensemble of solo singers, chorus (from Salzburg), and orchestra, and fascinating, yet subtle, horseman/horsewomanship which builds somewhat slowly in impact and offers a rare glimpse of this art form for those who have not enjoyed this art in Vienna or Versailles.  Subtitles allowed one to easily follow the variant biblical text to the well known Mozart Christian mass setting.  Mozart lovers will appreciate the opportunity to hear the staged variant setting.  I subtracted a half star to alert readers that the horsemanship is aristocratic and subtle, and not like that in Wyoming, Argentina, or eastern Hungary; and that the film camera angles at the very outset suffer from too much glare which contrasts with the otherwise nice rich HD image.  A fairly short disc to enjoy, share, and discuss.",1471651200,,879,5.294964028776978
8729234,3,B013Z7BE9K,"As an avid and active horseman myself, I looked forward to this release. I was wrong! Boring might be the best word to choose. I've seen more exciting horsemanship on a Saturday morning at a riding academy!",1450396800,,206,4.594594594594595
