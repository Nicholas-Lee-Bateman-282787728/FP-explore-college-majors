58435,3,078322561X,"Not quite as endearing as the first Babe.  The sequel is faster paced and not as appropriate for younger children...Our 8 year found parts to be a bit scary, but this is a sensitive child. A decent film though.",1466467200,,210,4.384615384615385

58440,5,078322561X,"Ok.  You might not believe this but I had to buy this movie for Tucker, our 7 yr. old Golden Retriever.  Our house sitter accidentally deleted the recording a few months ago, & we bought this to replace it, as this is his all time favorite movie.  He actually watches TV - not everything, mind you - he is very discerning, sometimes only a glance at a dog on screen, then, on rare occasions, or for his two favorites, (Lassie Come Home is the other) he'll watch almost an entire movie.  But Pig in the City is his favorite. I say - ""Want to watch Pig in the City'?"" & he stops what he's doing, lays down with his head on his front paws, & settles for much of the movie.  I even bought him a piglet stuffed hand puppet that he knows by name - it's his favorite soft toy.

Too funny - I know.  And this movie doesn't scare him at all!",1458691200,,832,4.036585365853658

I didn't see the purpose in having the brief scene with the very scantily clad young women in suggestive poses -- unnecessary to the plot and unexpected in a children's movie.

58449,2,078322561X,I really didn't like this film because it showed how there are so many stray animals in this world.  It wasn't a very happy movie kinda of sad really.  Doesnt really seem like a film for kids.  First one was so much better.,1447286400,,223,4.1395348837209305

58465,1,078322561X,This movie is poorly done and is no comparison to the original. We where disappointed as we previewed it for our Grandchildren. We did not make it past the first 30 minutes.

58469,2,078322561X,"We never finished this movie. It didn't have the charm and was darker than the first ""Babe"". My 7 year old wasn't into it, he said it was ""too scary"" (he gets scared a little easier than his twin sister). Twin sister wasn't scared, but also wasn't that interested.  Even though I kept telling my son it would have a happy ending, he didn't want to watch it. And I have to admit, I was glad to switch to something else.",1431043200,,418,4.160493827160494

58473,5,078322561X,"A fun movie. Not as good, in my opinion, as the original Babe, but enjoyable none the less. This story is about the farmer's wife and Babe going to the city to be in a contest to try and win money to try and save the farm. The farmer set off the action in the movie but became a minor part of the unfolding story. Mickey Rooney was a hoot in his character.",1427932800,,356,3.8904109589041096

Some of the reviews bash it because they think the sexual innuendo and undertones are not suitable for children and I say those people should just their TVs right out the door and not let their kids watch anything, no cartoons, nothing and pray someday their kids can actually make it in the real world without their rose-colored glasses.

58525,1,078322561X,"This movie should be avoided. So many things wrong with it from the irritating (Farmer Hoggitt's wife changes her accent) to the poor attempts at slapstick humour, to the absolutely dark and morbid overtones (You will actually think they are abou to kill Farmer Hoggett in the first 15 minutes). This movie has it all, foreclusure, wrongful imprisonment, animal cruelty, full body cast level injuries.

The best part is the first 30 seconds where the parade celebrating Babe takes place. It is all downhill after that. My two year old LOVES the original Babe, we are instructed to watch it frequently, I would have loved to have had another alternative for her, but this is not it.",1407456000,,681,4.82051282051282

58533,5,078322561X,"What can you say about this movie?  The directors must be deranged, the producers high on drugs, and the people funding this must have a love for the first movie.  This is not your modern sequel.  It is, I dare say, artsy, if not strictly absurd.  It is similar to Alice Through the Looking Glass.  It is a completely off color, and full of scenes that you should NOT let your children watch.  That being said, I have watched it myriad of times, and can't help but think there was a stroke of genius somewhere here.  This is not a child's movie, It is artistic suicide.

58555,1,078322561X,"Babe #1 is a WONDERFUL and delightful movie.
Babe - Pig in the City is dark, scary and depressing.

I was extremely disappointed by Pig in the City. It was scary for children. It had a VERY dark feel to the whole thing.
There were things I don't want my young children to see like a bunch of women in bikinis. A creepy man/clown (and countless other creepy people) A dog hanging upside down, thrashing around about to drown.

There were subtle things that a small child wouldn't notice but are completely unnecessary in a child's film, like a sensual billboard or a light up sign on a building that says ""MORE Pleasure"" making it very obvious what that place was.

I seriously felt gross and depressed when this movie was done.
I recommend only investing in the first movie.",1381363200,2,774,4.514285714285714

58575,5,078322561X,"This movie looks like it was done by Fellini, Dali, Rube Goldberg, and George Miller.  The most mind blowing spectacular fantasy fest you could ever want.  If you thought Babe was wonderful, this will blow your mind totally.  It is not the same kind of movie even though it has the same characters, plus some new ones and the farmer, James Cromwell, is only in it briefly while Magda Szubanski takes the lead and how wonderful she is.  If you didn't get enough of her in Babe, this will totally be a treat as she is one of the most comedically talented actresses you could ever want with her roly poly cheeks and body and a scene where gallons of shellac gets dumped on her and, well, I won't ruin it for you, but what happens to her wardrobe after it dries will cause you to laugh so hard you may need adult diapers.  And the city.  You just will not believe this city.  It's a composite of every famous city in the world with all the most picturesque buildings and architectural structures from every famous from Paris to New York, maybe even San Francisco or Seattle.  This is not only a fantasy, it is also an art film and unlike art films you will not be bored for an instance.  Loved this movie and though I saw it many years ago, I always wind up watching it at least once a year, or when ever I see that it's showing on HBO.  Oh, yes.  I also forgot to say, this film is made with love and there are loads of lovely sentiments expressed throughout.

This 1998 classic about a beguiling little porklette coming to the immediate aid of an entire FARM by hoofing it into the great big unknown that is the city is as captivating as it is whimsical. It takes risks. It speaks to an entire generation. It is a metaphor for economic turmoil and fascism at the same time. That pig is a method actor of Christian Bale like proportions (The Fighter Christian Bale, not American Psycho Christian Bale). If you play it backwards, it plays the melody to John Lennon's ""Imagine"". President Obama would watch this movie to get himself pumped for debates (allegedly).",1362873600,,677,4.745762711864407

I only subscribe to children's stories that I don't find wildly upsetting myself, despite how my own children might love it and be able to appreciate the unique perspective -- at least among children's media -- that it offers. I need a setting that in no way confronts the complicated ideals of modernity, provides an adequate metaphor for rural and urban dissonance, nor allows me to acknowledge that my own frail whisp of a mortal coil may be shrugged off at any notice, as is undeniably true. I refuse to acknowledge my human frailty or live fuller because of it.

However, I was caught off-guard with the sequel.  It lacks the charm of the first Babe, was much darker and frankly was strange.  My son, who is 9, said, ""That one was weird"" and that about sums it up. It seems the moral lesson in the sequel is about animal cruelty, which is an admirable topic to address.  The film was just not executed well.  The scenes with human actors reminded me of something from Dr. Suess.  Odd clown costumes, people with pig noses, women with ""Cindy Lou Whoo"" hairstyles....it just felt like an entirely different movie with the only thing in common with the original Babe being the pig and the duck.  Farmer Hoggett was barely in the movie at all.  Mrs. Hoggett was featured much more in this film, which wasn't a bad thing until the bizarre scene towards the end when she dons the clown costume, does ballroom bungee jumping in it, and ends up with a huge inflated balloon instead of pants.

It was irresponsible of the Motion Picture Association of America to give a ""G"" rating to this violence-filled film (including hanging, drowning and guns!  And that is just what we tolerated until we finally said ""Enough"" and put in ""Mary Poppins"" instead.)  According to the MPAA website, a ""G"" rating means, ""This is a film which contains nothing in theme, language, nudity and sex, violence, etc. that would, in the view of the Rating Board, be offensive to parents whose younger children view the film. The G rating is not a certificate of approval nor does it signify a children's film. Some snippets of language may go beyond polite conversation but they are common everyday expressions. No stronger words are present in G-rated films. The violence is at a minimum. Nudity and sex scenes are not present, nor is there any drug use content.""  Does anyone on the Rating Board even have young children?

If ""Babe: Pig in the City"" is what the MPAA considers safe for viewing by young children, they are obviously out of touch with OUR family's standards.

Horror is what they find, and Babe has to rise to the occasion to save the day.  The themes and moods of this movie are much different than the first one.  Whereas the original Babe was very lighthearted, with occasional scenes of suspense and thorror, this movie is the opposite.  Here there are mostly scenes of suspense, with only some lighthearted scenes.  The comedy is not that good, but the special effects are a lot better.

After a few difficulties our brave and good Babe soon becomes leader of this motley crew of city animals and ultimately leads them to safety on Hoggett's farm.  There are laugh out loud funny scenes in this film as well as those that will lead you to the brink of tears.

58679,1,078322561X,"This is quite possibly the worst movie I've ever seen.  My husband and I (who are a young married couple with NO kids) bought it as a set with the original Babe movie.  The original Babe is an absolute favorite of ours.  We were both looking forward to watching this movie.  He was practically jumping up and down in anticipation when we put it on.  What a disappointment!!!

In the first scene, Hoggit has an extremely violent accident in his well and is out for the rest of the movie.  The Mrs. travels to a seemingly post-apocalyptic city (which is a mix of every major city in the world) in order to make money to save the farm.  This city is void of any halfway-decent moral life form.  Everyone she encounters harasses or assaults her.  The airport does a cavity search on her.  Someone steals her purse and she ends up getting carted off in a police paddy wagon.  Babe is left to fend for himself.  A family of monkeys is staying in the same hotel and they steal Babe and exploit him in their magic act, which is performed in a hospital full of kids that ends up catching on fire.  When Babe gets hungrier than he can bear, the monkeys tell him where he can go to get food.  They take him to a yard of vicious dogs who chase Babe for 10 minutes.  This action attracts the attention of all the animals in the city, who watch the spectacle but don't think for a second about helping poor Babe.

Eventually the animals all become friends.  One puppy tells Babe something to the extent of his humans tied him up in a bag and threw him out of their car.  One of the monkeys becomes pregnant and has babies in the same night.  Then animal control barges in and violently captures every last animal in the house, smashing a goldfish tank and strangling Babe on their way out.  These scenes were difficult to watch and I'm sure they couldn't film them without some kind of animal cruelty.

After some hustle, Mrs. Hoggit gets out of court and goes to find her pig.  She runs around the city wearing a clown costume, which she ties up to a runner in a fancy ballroom and bounces around the room for about 20 minutes.  If you can't follow me, good.  You shouldn't be able to as the outrageous movie makes absolutely no sense.

The morals of the movie are:
1. Animals are not allowed in cities.
2. People are horrible and will do anything they can to hurt animals.
3. City animals are evil.

It is way too violent for kids.  It is just plain awful for anyone else.  I can't say enough bad things about this movie.  It left me stressed out and angry.  It was painful to watch.

Throughout the movie, my husband would turn to me and say, ""What the heck was the director thinking!?"" among some choice expletives.  He can stand a little violence.  He is in the Army.  But the pointless violence in this movie did not make any sense.  Keep in mind that neither of us has been around kids for more than a few hours at a time.  We were appalled.  I guess some may say that we ""didn't get it.""  But honestly, what is there to get?  I can't find the morals; if there are any, they are hidden deep in the darkness of the movie.  And pray tell, what is the point of a fat woman in a blown up clown suit bouncing around a room for 20 minutes?  It wasn't even funny the first time!",1144108800,18,3264,4.249185667752443

58683,5,078322561X,"Many people criticize Babe - Pig In The City, because it is much darker than the original. I don't have children, but I can understand why parents may dislike this movie. Although, it's equally pleasant as the first, the message is deeper. In the first we learned that if you are true to yourself you can accomplish anything. In this sequel we learn that people can be extremely cruel (sometimes, for no reason), but despite that with a little kindness we can win over our enemies.

The original Babe was rated G for General Audiences, the sequel was rated PG for Parental Guidance Suggested. The reason why this movie was given a harsher rating than the first is (in my opinion) because, there are scenes that may be too scary for younger children. A few examples of this are when the chimps fool Babe into entering an area where two vicious dogs await him. The dogs chase him and try to kill him. During the chase, one of the dogs nearly drowns. In another scene, animal control catches the animals in a frightening manner. In yet another scene, two newborn baby chimps dangle from a light fixture where it seems certain doom awaits them. In another, a goldfish almost suffocates when his fish bowl shatters and he desperately needs air. A handicapped puppy almost gets run over and almost dies. Despite these ""flaws"", Babe- Pig In The City is a brilliant little film, that isn't your average, noisy, pointless, plot-less, garbage made for children nowadays. It is actually a thoughtful movie, which although has some tense moments, deserves to be in your collection.

58685,1,078322561X,"My wife and I have been looking for movies appropriate for our 3.5 year old daughter being shown in theaters. We were delighted to know that a local theater was shoding this movie for a few days and took her there this morning.

The movie started with a man {pig's owner} getting critically injured because of pig. The plot then followed to having pig's owner's wife getting abused by assorted characters. Next was a scene where pig is abducted by monkeys that belong to a very disgusting clown. Following that scene pig causes the clown's act to catch on fire and the clown to get critically injured. There is a shot where the clown is being brought on a stretecher looking like Darth Vader outside of his encounter suit! Meanwhile there have been no friendly or nice scenes. So it was nice to see a scene where a duck gets dropped off by a pelican and lands in a beautiful meadow. But as soon as the duck lands things change. A target board pops up behind it and a bunch of people start shooting at it!! At this point my daughter was in tears and we took her and left the movie theater.

I really want to know why does the acclaimed director think that a bunch of people shooting at a duck is right for ~3 year old kids. I am also amazed that this movie gets a G. Just because the main character is an animal it does not make the movie safe for young childern. If you have very young children I strongly suggest that you avoid this movie.

When Babe is chased and about to be murdered by a vicious guard dog, the tables turn and he suddenly has the upper hand. Rather than leave him to drown, he risks his life to save him. I was so moved by this scene, I cried.

You vacuous critics need to realize that the shows your kids are watching on Saturday mornings are all about vengeance and retribution. This movie stands on high moral ground at every turn. There are scenes equally as vital such as Babe saving the goldfish, rescuing the others, saving the baby, providing shelter for indigents, offering compassion to the outcast, sharing food with the hungry, peacemaking, the list goes on and on.

I'll say it again; those who don't understand this movie are morally inept or have never put their faith into practice and realized the suffering that comes with it. Babe is a spiritual innocent in a fallen world who manages to retain his soul and redeem the lives of countless others.

58688,4,078322561X,"Babe: Pig in the City, the sequel to the ethically popular, Babe, sets a much darker tone for the farm pig that shows kidness and morals. The movie is set in an unnamed city (possibly Seattle, Chicago or Boston) where Babe is being chased down by vicious dogs with an intent to kill and show more human like actions, e.g. the pitbull acts like a gang or mafia leader, and the orangutang who cares less for the animals around him. The movie's main plot was to capture another Babe moment and the fact of him going to the fair in the city, which never occured. Instead, it was Babe who got himself into a corner where he'd have to talk his way out of it, and gain the respect and friendship of other animals.

The movie is by far a great flick to watch, family or adult, the violence is mild and offers a message of friendship, and although some animals may not have morals, this movie brings out the morals in them and thwarts out the hate in them that is seen everywhere today.

That's what it's like when you start growing up and start gradually moving beyond the comforts of home.  This is not a film for young kids.  Let them watch babe when they are settling in as a young child in the world.  Then as they move into their own sequel of growing up a little, they can watch this sequel of pig in the city.  It'll make it easier for them! People have compared it to Grimm's fairy tales - very true.  These old tales were at a time when children were expected to grow up early and fast.  The bottom line?  Don't either protect or underestimate your kids for too long.  After all, they are watching more violent but mindless material every afternoon and saturday morning - at least this will impart some kind of positive values.  In line with this, regarding the comments about animal cruelty, there is rarely a call for courage without adversity and cruelty being present.  Also, do your kids watch those nature documentaries?  These documentaries are educational perhaps but without any of the moral complexity and aesthetic beauty of babe pig in the city - and still very, very cruel!

In this case, it isn't -- I just needed to know who was responsible for this ill-conceived train wreck, and discovered it never had a real ""writer"", per se, just a producer / director who cobbled together a storyboard and made a movie out of it.
Production values, art direction, cute pig voice, lots of special effects, WHO CARES about any of it if the story SUCKS?  Here's some advice from Steve Jobs:  ""Story Is King"".  Without a cogent, compelling story all you have is noise.
To give you an example of the endemic stupidity of this non-story, there is a scene where the pig DOESN'T KNOW WHAT A DOG IS!  He was f**king RAISED BY DOGS, and he can't tell the difference between a sheep and a PIT BULL?  Didn't he head-butt a dog not unlike a pit bull in the first movie?  You know, the poacher scene?
Another doozy:  the chef stealing the pig.  At least in ""The Little Mermaid"" the chef's actions make sense, as it's a crab the chef's after, and crabs are customarily killed by the chefs who cook them.  How many chefs slaughter their own pork?  Is he going to do the deed on the cutting board next to the Spinach Alfredo?
This movie is more like a comic book or Moulin Rouge, in that it's filled with disjointed iconography more concerned with making an artistic statement than telling a coherent story.

I was in awe of the film, it was quite whimsical, extremely original, at times terrifying, and at times absolutely hilarious. This is about as much of a kid's film as ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" (also INCREDIBLE, yet not deserving of its cult status). If you have seen the Nightmare Before Christmas, or know of it, then you know what to expect of this. This film goes against the grain in terms of what a children's film is supposed to be. It is intelligently written and directed, and great entertainment. To this day I still love to watch it on occasion, just to revisit this great love from 5 years in my past. Much has been made of the darkness in this film, and I'll admit, it is intense at times. The scene in which the old clown, played by the incredible mickey rooney, collapses and sets fire to the room after Babe messes up his Chimpanzee act, only to die not soon after, is still difficult to watch, as are a few other scenes. This is dark subject matter in places, but brilliant nonetheless. I've read in reviews here that it is comparable to Fellini, and I must agree. As a HUGE fan of Fellini films, I too notice a wonderful blend of the light and dark in the film. The scene where the Animal Control people invade the house and cage all the animals brings me to tears of sadness, but the scene in which Mrs. Hoggett is bouncing around the roof of the ballroom in a clown costume brings me to tears of joy. This is one of the many riotous and hilarious scenes in the film. The actress who played Mrs. Hoggett deserves some sort of award for her performance, as well. She is a delight.
ALL IN ALL, THIS FILM IS WONDERFUL, CERTAINLY NOT FOR EVERYONE, AND REALLY MORE FOR ADULTS OR OLDER, MORE MATURE KIDS, THAN YOUNGER KIDS, FOR IT MAY WELL PROVE TRAUMATIC.

58705,5,078322561X,"Forget any preconceptions about this franchise that may have been established with ""Babe."" While that film was indeed a masterpiece, this is a sequel with its own agenda and purpouse. Try to reach back, dear ones,to your first experience with the tales told by the Brothers Grimm. That's the tone this film embraces. Like those dark tales of yore, ""Babe- Pig in the city"" establishes a universe wherein the innocent are victims, and only the truest and most noble of hearts can conquer the adversity the world often presents us with. The plot: after the sheep-pig inadvertently causes a disastrous accident that leaves Farmer Hogget unable to provide for his farm, Babe and Mrs. Hogget travel to the big city to earn money in an effort to keep the farm afloat. There is violence in this film, and many moments that are darker and more mean spirited than in the first film. And I say ""bravo"" to this decision- becuase what director George Miller has provided is a wonderful parable about the need for each and every one of us to retain that sense of decency and compassion that defines our humanity (porcinity?) , even in the face of the most dire of circumstances. Stop asking yourself if the kids will be okay with this movie, and instead ask yourself if you enjoyed it. This is the definitive family film - it has enough to entertain the tykes, but it is squarely aimed at the adults who will sit through this with them. With impressive visuals, a terrfic story and  - ultimately- a message that needs to be heard in this day and age,""Babe - Pig in the City"" is a masterpiece of a fable. A cautionary tale that both engages and enlivens. There is love, laughter and hope to be found within  this film. Don't miss this picture by any means.

58706,5,078322561X,"Just before he passed away, Gene Siskel made this his best picture of the year.  I just watched this movie again and enjoyed it more this time than I remembered.  Babe has a unique visual quality that this movie takes to another level.  The representation of the Metropolis is fairly amazing.

In this movie we get a fable more about the animals than the people.  Farmer Hoggett appears only in the beginning and end and Mrs. Hoggett has the job of delivering the pig to the city and taking him back home while providing some determined comic relief (as she did in the first movie).  Mickey Rooney has an amazingly touching almost-a-cameo role, as well.

I think of this as a fable with the animals and shows how approaching a harsh and hopeless situation with a good heart (such as Babe's) can transform it into something livable and meaningful.  Ferdinand seeking out Babe to be with his Luck Pig is a very neat sub-story that provides some great laughs as well.  I found the scene where Flealick is thrown hard from his bite on the captors' truck and ends up in a broken heap to be quite touching.  His semi-conscious dream of being whole again and leaping for butterflies is just right.

You either like Babe's sweetness or you don't.  I do.  When he is sent to face his doom with the Doberman and the Pit Bull because he is told they are sheep he tries to handle it with what he knows and what he is told.  Still, when it all goes bad he does his level best to survive and when he does, he goes back to rescue his tormentor.  Nice stuff.

Probably the lackluster reaction to the movie came more from its split character as a slapstick comedy (when Mrs. Hoggett reclaims Babe at the formal dinner in the clown suit) and as a somewhat grim morality play (when the animals struggle to survive on their own and their capture and escape from the authorities).  Such intensity mixed with a stack of champagne glasses at risk can confuse.",1074124800,4,1936,4.47008547008547
58707,5,078322561X,"This sequel to the unabashedly charming ""Babe"" is once again a fairy tale, but a much grimmer one indeed.  Right away we're plagued with the near fatal accident of beloved farmer James Cromwell and Babe the pig is off to the city with Cromwell's wife, played with intense gusto by Magda Szubinski.  Once in the city, Babe finds himself counted amongst the other animals in a strange hotel run by Mary Stein and Mickey Rooney, in a rather short but effective performance.  Seems like animals are nothing but outcasts in a society plagued with unfeeling and insufferable humans.
Needless to say, George Miller has helmed a flawless gallery of animatronic animals, who become almost human in their plight.  There are some brilliant scenes, particularly the balloon sequence; the finale in the ballroom; Babe's rescue of the previously malicious pit bull.  And once again, those delightful mice act as the Greek chorus, singing a plaintively moving version of ""Are You Lonesome Tonight.""

58708,2,078322561X,"""One of the best of 1998""?  Please.  Babe:  Pig in the City is a crushing disappointment, full of show-offy camera work, animal torture, and jarring elements that never even come close to becoming a story.
George Miller may have co-written the original Babe, but his work on this sequel only proves that Babe director Chris Noonan deserves more of the credit on the success of the original.  In Noonan's hands, Magda Szubanski was a lovable buffoon and comic relief; in Miller's, she becomes an over-acting victim.  In Noonan's film, the piglet Babe was a polite, not very bright, yet thoroughly lovable character with loves, fears and flaws; in Miller's, Babe becomes an entirely passive character, and his experiences and emotions are kept from us at arm's length by Miller's messy scripting.  Most grievously, there is not a single likeable character in this film.  The ""cynical chimps"" have overwritten lines, the dogs and cats never go beyond facetious posing, and the farm animals that the first film painstakingly set up for us are reduced to a handful of lines in the beginning.  Even Babe himself, still adorably voiced, doesn't generate much pathos, because the story is so outlandish and unfocused that we have no basis for feeling for Babe's experience of them.  Miller was simply so busy trying to make this a ""darker"" film that he forgets to make it into an engrossing one.  While he shoots some interesting visual gags, these never form a coherent sequence of events, let alone an engaging story.  If Miller had had the good sense to retain James Cromwell's crucial Farmer Hoggett character, he would have still had some chemistry to play with.
And yes...there's the animal cruelty.  A drowning dog, dangling by its foot on a chain; the pig being brutally assaulted by guard dogs...I for one don't find this stuff entertaining at all, nor does it make any kind of statement other than that the filmmakers are desperate to impress us with more animal stunts.  The first film had moments of danger, but these were always handled sensitively and within the confines of the animal world, making them naturalistic and emotive rather than manipulative and cruel.  I can literally feel the hand of the director at the end of that chain dangling the dog into the river, and it's a downright nasty feeling.  Miller makes me even more incensed because he tries to cloak the cruelties in false moments of exaltation, but it's futile.  The characters are so poorly drawn and our sympathies so indifferent to any of them that there's nothing to justify what Miller puts these poor animal actors through.
I give this film two stars because this film does have some complex blocking of animals into dramatic contexts.  Unfortunately, these are also more impressive than engaging, for the characters just don't generate much interest because we have no sympathy for any of them.  I marvel at the technical achievement of the technical teams, matching complex dialogue to animals' mouths and training them to touch each other, high-five, and kiss, while remaining unmoved by the dramatic situations.  The first film achieved much, much more with less dazzling effects, just by making you attached to the animals.  If Pig in the City only had one character like Rex, with a complex and touching back story and emotional motivation, it would not be such a bust.
George Miller may have co-written the first Babe, but here he single-handedly strangled a nice movie franchise with his ""dark"" sensibilities and need to dazzle with camera tricks and ""breakthrough"" animal manipulations.  I'm as big a fan as you'll find of the world of Babe, but I'd say skip this one.  The box office results, for once, are an accurate gauge of quality.",1071446400,7,3728,4.921725239616613

58710,5,078322561X,"""Babe: Pig in the City"" deserves all the rave reviews it got when it first came out--and none of the poor ones. Standing on its own, it is good enough. But as a sequel, it is stupendous! The storyline is a bit bizarre, for it begins on the farm; with Fly, Ferdinand, Farmer Hoggett, and even those singing mice. But when Babe accidentally sends his master tumbling down a well and getting seriously injured, the farm is put in jeopardy. Mrs. Hoggett takes Babe to the city brimming with eccentric characters, hoping to have him perform his famous sheepherding for a financial reward. What city this is is never specified; however, upon seeing the skyline we can tell that it is all the big cities of the world mashed into one! A metaphor for how intimidating and new it is for the little pig? Perhaps. But since the farm is in New Zealand, we can safely assume that if the city MUST be just one, it would likely be Sydney, Australia.

The movie has a great deal of humor in it; and not just an occasional chuckle. Some of it is real rip-roaring, side-splitting laughter. For instance, Mrs. Hoggett (who does provide most of this humor, come to think of it), bouncing around an elaborate banquet hall in an overinflated rubber clown suit. Or, speaking rapidly about the ""blessed pig"" to a pig-nosed judge. Or, losing Babe at the airport because a sniffer Beagle pretended to alert his people that Babe was carrying illegal substances. (You see, the dog doesn't know WHY he sniffs, only that he gets rewarded when he barks.) Esme Hoggett is certainly a comic character; while you can't avoid that some of the humor stems from the fact of her very large frame (especially when juxtaposed with her skin-and-bones landlady), if you happen to feel that she's being made fun of, in my opinion, she is always portrayed in a positive manner.

Now, before I get into the charm of the story and characters, I'll address the pressing issue of ""darkness"" in this film. Perhaps it isn't the happy, cheery, sunshiny childrens' story everyone hoped for, or found in the original ""Babe."" But let's face it: there IS evil and tragedy in the world. This movie IS NOT a gruesome, grotesque, overly-strange nightmare, as some have described it. Kids can certainly enjoy this without getting disturbed. Adults are being too sensitive. There are scenes of fear and danger; such as the goldish flopping on the floor (and getting tossed into the water by Babe), the Bull Terrier (not Pit Bull, as stated in the movie!) hanging by his leash from the bridge and almost drowning (ALSO getting valiently resuced by Babe), Zootie's (ugly) baby falling from the ceiling (and being caught by Thelonius), the semi-creepy (only 'cause he's a clown) Uncle Fugly Floom putting on a show for hospitalized children with his troupe of performing animals & dying somehow after a terrible freak accident during it, and Flealick, the afflicted, but spunky, wheelchair-bound Jack Russell Terrier who gets thrown from a truck and almost dies. It is a very sad moment. My kid brother was touched, but not deeply disturbed. The dog was alive and peppy, anyway, within moments. It wouldn't have hurt too badly if he actually HAD died; it just would have been sadder (because we ALL know that we always care more about the animals than the humans in movies, right?). It would also have been very tear-worthy, having seen Flealick spend a moment in 'doggie heaven' where he has full use of his legs. But I knew they just couldn't have him die in a kids' movie. So please, people, quit your whining. This is FAR from ""rated-R"" material.

The waterfront neighborhood in the city which Babe visits is adorable. The characters he meets, both human and animal, are very endearing. Mrs. Hoggett takes him to the only (adorably cozy) hotel in the area that allows animals (and is therefore despised by the neighbors and must keep it a secret that they have animals.) There he meets a family of monkeys, who are VERY good actors, I must say. They are waiting for ""Himself,"" which is the name for their master. Fugly is, like Arthur Hoggett himself, a man of *very* few words (in fact, none at all, just mumbles. XD)
Sadly, ""Himself"" dies, because he is a very old man. ""Himself""'s niece is Miss Floom, the sweet but nervous landlady with a habit of rapidly asking questions and then answering them in order to give information. A real animal lover (despite seemingly being allergic to the very animals she loves, cares for, and shelters), she is devestated when Babe invites a Southern belle pink poodle (like the Blanche Deveraux of dogs), the Bull Terrier (who, after being rescued by Babe, turns into his personal bodyguard instead of hunter), and a huge array of other homeless animals into her hotel. The neighbors contact the police, and the entire place is invaded, with the animals being taken away in cages. The chase scenes surrounding this part are VERY impressive and thrilling. It's up to Babe, of course, Mrs. Hoggett (the funniest person in the movie) and Miss Floom (arguably the most likable person in the movie) to save the animals and, hence, the day.

The ending is a real charmer. Miss Floom moves to the country with Mrs. Hoggett. The hotel is converted into a loud but legal dance hall to annoy the neighbors even more. The animals all move in with ""Herself"" (Mrs. Hoggett.) And the Bull Terrier has pups with the pink Poodle. The sets in this movie are absolutely adorable. And the movie itself is incredibly insightful. I once watched it and wrote 13 entire pages of notes on all the interesting things I noticed in it & its characters! I found myself wanting to watch it every day and never tiring of it. On the whole this is one of the most adorable, thoroughly enjoyable movies you may ever see. If anything, you might at times, like me, wish that it would get a little more personal, because it never loses its sense of mystery and dreamlike weirdness--but, that is the film's enchanting aura. And in the end, you should feel very warm towards it; just as in the original, Babe is a pure, virtuous little pig with lessons to teach about the beauty of love, selflessness, and forgiveness.",1061164800,5,6159,4.7

58724,2,078322561X,"The first movie, Babe, was cute and funny and very Disneyesque.  This bizarre sequel is more like a Fellini film.  It begins with a disturbing nightmarish scene of the farmer (from the original Babe) falling down a well.  Shortly after, it moves the setting to the city.  The animal characters in the city are not cute and cuddly like on the farm.  There are strange and bizarre personalities to most of them.  The imagery is equally bizarre... the use of close-ups and slow motion effects for some of the stranger things makes the oddity more intense.  There is a psychotic pit-bull who consistently tries to kill Babe.  There is a lame Chihuahua using a wheelchair type of wagon to get around.  There is a manic depressive orangutan, and a family of crazy chimps.  Then, there is the clown character (played by Mickey Rooney) who has more sadness in his life than joy.  The whole thing is just so surreal and depressing.
On its own merit, Pig In The City stands as an interesting and unusual movie, especially for fans of Felliniesque films.  But, compared to the predecessor, Babe, this one is like Hell to its previous Heaven.  If you like bizarre movies, you might like this.  But, do not... I repeat... DO NOT let your kids see this one!

58725,5,078322561X,"The original ""Babe"" was a huge and deserved hit when released in 1995, earning a Best Picture nomination for it's novel animation and trendsetting technology.  Simply said, this follow-up film subtitled ""Pig in the City"" is equally ingenious, heartwarming and special, indeed.
Critics hailed its messages and transplanted landscape and risky vision.  From the warm, embracing countryside, to the chilly rotten city, Babe (and in this case Mrs. Hoggett) venture far from home, encountering profound characters and learning life lessons along the way.
Unfortunately, Babe 2 was a commercial dud, far underperforming the original, due to an uninspired marketing campaign and the film's overall noir-drama characteristics.  Alot of parents kept kids away hearing the movie would upset them, and although some intense moments occur, kids by and large have seen far worse on afternoon TV.  This film dares to stretch beyond what was expected of it, and becomes a thoughtful, complex fable in the process ... but never fails to entertain young and old alike.  It's a film anyone can enjoy, at any time, at any age and a rare thing indeed as a sequel that's literally equal to its predeseser.  So many of us loved and cherished the magical Babe during his first incarnation, but trust me, this hog is going places!  A class act all the way that needs to be revisited or enjoyed spontanelously the first time around.  DO NOT MISS IT.",1012262400,20,1424,5.029787234042553

Weep! as a depressive orangutan tries in vain to maintain his dignity in a world that strips all dignity away.

Finally, fall! to your wretched knees and pray desperately in the implacable face of an uncaring universe for some small sign that life is more than an endless black night of pain and despair that makes a mockery of hope and a cruel joke of the conceit that there is any kindness or joy to be found in the barren desolation of this cold and merciless world.",1012176000,9,876,4.579617834394904
58727,2,078322561X,"The origianal Babe movie was wonderfull.  It was like a live action disney movie where annimals talk.  Now we have the sequel and we have to ask ourselfs, what the heck went wrong here?  Babe 2 is one of the worst sequels to a movie I have ever seen.  Its incrediably dark, disturbing and very unpleasent.

The film starts off right where the first one ended, with farmer Hogget returning to the farm to live happily ever after, but sience this is a sequel, we cannot let that happen.  So Babe accidentaly pushes Farmer Hogget into a well and nearly kills him.  While he is recovering, the happy cheerfull bank people show up and tell the Hoggets that they are about to loose the farm.  So Ms. Hogget decides to head into the city with Babe and make some money.  When they arrive they eventually reach a hotel in what has to be the most bogus city set I've ever seen.

After that the typical bad stuff happens and its a lot worse then before.  The annimal cast consists of really mean dogs, annoying bossy Godfather like apes and a whole lot more.  The only nice annimals are Good natured Babe, some cute Kittens, and Ferdinand the Duck.  All the other annimals are making Babes life really miserable.

While at first Babe 2 seems charming, that instantly jumps out the window when you first see the annimal cruelty scenes.  Babe is constantly attacked, a dog is strangled by his chain underwater and nearly drowns, another dog attacks a car and is dead for a few minutes (but he recovers) kittens go hungry, and in a horrifyingly disturbing sequence, the hotel is assulted by annimal catchers.  All this cruelty to annimals, and you wish they would die just to put them out of thier misery.

I was shocked at how un-kid friendly this is.  I recommned that you don't take your kids to see it, it will diminish the fond memories of the first one.

The Good: Its a Babe movie, The narrator does a great job, some nice annimals

The bad: really really dark(and not in lighting sense), awful sets.

and the ugly: Lots of annimal cruelty scenes, the apes and dogs are very annoying, definatly not for young kids.",1003449600,5,2107,4.492105263157895

(Where does he get the notion that Babe was taken to America...look at the visuals, Leonard, this is ""Everyplace"", not just one place.) One of the most imaginative and visually appealing films I've seen. Babe does indeed take the audience on a journey, sometimes dark (but all good stories must have ""dark"" side...otherwise, it's just marshmallow fluff), through the dark side of a civilization. (Again, this place is not specified, which makes it all the more interesting.) Babe learns quickly about the other side and with his good heart and determination, saves the farm and a whole cast of dogs, monkeys, and cats. GREAT film! A must see. This isn't Disney, kids.

58729,5,078322561X,"Babe: Pig in the City will indelibly be compared with the original Babe movie, but keep them seperate please, thank you. This movie is a grotesque and satirical fable that is unlike any movie I have ever seen before. It is an unpleasant movie at times, but since when is this criteria on which to judge a movie?  This is no movie for kids.  Sure, kids can watch it, but they will ask a lot of questions; I'm simply not convinced that it was created with kids in mind.
In Babe: Pig in the City, Babe's clumsiness nearly kills the farmer, and Babe and Mrs. Hoggart venture to the city in order to earn money to save the farm. What is to be a simple, round-trip journey to and from the city becomes a ugly misadventure as the city sucks Babe and Mrs. Hoggart into its apathetic grounds.  The city is never referred to by name, and features a hodge-podge of famous landmarks which crowd the backdrop and cloud the city's identity.  Furthermore, the city is depicted as institutional hell where Babe's cheekiness and benign rationality are powerless (unlike in the original). Babe: Pig in the City does inevitably show, however, that there are good people (and animals) wherever you go, and, to them, Babe proves to be an asset and a valuable friend.  Together, the benevolent forces of animal and kind-hearted human prevail over the ubiquitous pale of nihilism and apathy.
This movie includes one of the greatest chase scenes I have ever witnessed that comes replete with emotive redemption. The movie is thoroughly original and comes highly recommended.",978048000,8,1550,4.725925925925926
58730,5,078322561X,"Some parents think young kids grow through seeing fictional characters struggle with adversity, even limited doses of evil, as long as good characters come out fine on the other side.  Other parents say, No, their young kids will encounter evil soon enough, and they don't need to hear it from books or films.  The argument is as old as the Brothers Grimm fairy tales read to kids for 150 years before anyone heard of Big Bird or Barney.  While I don't recommend showing ""Silence of the Lambs"" to a kindergartner to teach her that there is evil in the world, I think almost all five year olds, with adult guidance, can both enjoy and benefit from seeing ""Babe: Pig in the City"", one of the 1990s best family films.  The dark side of life, bad luck, and evil are things most children do encounter in one form or another at an early age, and they can grow to understand and be stronger for learning to cope with it.  If you're not sure your young child is ready for this film, preview it first.  If your child dislikes it, put it away for a year and come back to it. It's not a life-scarring literary or cinematic experience when the final outcome is a positive message that gives hope to all who struggle.
Bad stuff, and lots of it, certainly does happen to Babe and his friends and to the Hoggetts, particularly Mrs. Hoggett, the central human adult character in this sequel.  This is indeed a much darker film than the very enjoyable but fluffy original film, ""Babe"" (perhaps the main reason this superb film wasn't a hit commercially at the time of its release), and darker than the urban life view of Sesame Street.  Babe and Mrs. Hoggett are victimized because of their naivete by life in the big bad city.  They could have used the blues standard, ""If it wasn't for bad luck, I'd have no luck at all"" in the soundtrack, as things continue to go from bad to worse.  Is it too dark for children, at the depths of the story?  Is it darker than (even as nasty as) the old fairy tales?  No, though one could argue that evil in videos has more impact than evil in a book. Two-thirds of the way through the film, the corner is turned when Babe rescues a snarling enemy who would have died without The Pig's help.  An alliance is forged, and gradually, a way out of the tarpit mess emerges even though the situation seemed quite bleak on many fronts.  Of course, there is a very happy ending and the problems are resolved, and Babe and Mrs. Hoggett and by extension their viewers have grown more resilient through their experiences.  Like all great family films, ""Pig in the City"" has much to entertain all ages and holds up very well in repeat viewings.  The realism of the animal characterizations (especially the scheming, city-hardened chimps and orangutan) is particularly strong, and the writing and the dialogue are superb.
The DVD comes with choices for 1.85 widescreen (a very enjoyable full-format look even on 27"" sets) or a well-chosen fullscreen pan-and-scan.  There is a superb Dolby Digital 5.1 English language soundtrack (no DTS option), Dolby Surround in English or in dubbed French, and subtitles in French or English for the hearing impaired.  There is a theatrical trailer.  There are also additional features such as cast and crew bios, and some indication of a featurette about the making of the film I would have really liked to have seen, but I was unable to access the featurette or navigate more than one or two screens in on a bio on my Sony DVP- S360, a popular entry-level DVD player.  I'm not sure whether the problem was with my DVD player or the disk design.  Five stars for the film, four for the DVD version.",977356800,7,3640,4.54364471669219
58731,5,078322561X,"This is a fantastic (in all senses of the word) film that is as different from the original ""Babe"" as ""The Nightmare Before Christmas"" is from ""The Night Before Christmas.""  You and ""Babe"" the pig are transported to an enchantingly ""dark,"" but luminous metropolis, where animals are plunged into a kind of social Darwinism more treacherous than biological survival of the fittest.  There are lots of political and moral implications about conformity, power, even fascism; balanced by true human/animal traits of compassion, sacrifice, and bravery.
The production is outstanding. After you get used to the fact that there the city is no idyllic Scotland, you will be stunned and gratified by the originality of the sets and design. This is a city forged by day-glow imagination and feverish abstraction, it is all of one piece.  Give credit to the director, of course, but also to Andrew Leisnic's cinematography and Roger Ford's production design.
Is it too intense for young children?  Probably yes, for 2- or 3-year olds (or older), especially those who expect a reprise of the first. But I don't know your kids: Use your prior experience to guide you, or preview the movie yourself (you'll definitely enjoy it).  It's more intense than ""James and the Giant Peach,"" a slightly similar movie with an elevated scare factor.  Our just-turned-5 yr. old. loved it, but not as much, or on as many levels, as his parents. An absolute triumph!",977184000,13,1437,4.99163179916318
58741,2,078322561X,"The masterpiece ""Babe"" was one of the best family movies ever  made. Because it showed how animals think and do and altough the animals  talked, it was pretty realistic.
But the sequel, ""Babe: Pig in the  City"" is actualy pretty weird. First, this movie doesn't look as  realistic as the first movie. Especialy the hotel and the owner of it in  the city looks like they come right out of a cartoon. The animals are also  too much like humans. Part one kept them animals, but part 2 not. And, ok,  the farmers wife (played wonderfully in the first movie by Magda Szubanski)  was in the original already funny and a bit unreal but it was never as over  the top like the human characters in this one.
Then, this movie is very  dark. Tough part one had also some cruel things where animals have to deal  with and that made that movie sad, this movie has just too much of it. And  ok, I also think that children also have to be shown that it's not only fun  n the world but from a movie like this you wouldn't expect things like  this. And it is also too sad and cruel for young kids (like the monkey who  is caught when he had a goldfish in his hand).  The story even reminded me  sometimes of George Orwell's masterpiece ""Animal Farm"" where  animals also dealed with a lot of serious and cruel stuff based upon  Stalins actions.
I give the 2 stars for the great visual effects, but if  there's coming another Babe movie, they must set him on the farm. Perhaps  it is a good idea to make the animals deal with the new animatronic tools  which are used on a new farm nowadays (like a milk machine etc.)",969235200,4,1597,4.253333333333333
58742,3,078322561X,"I honestly do not know how to rate this movie.  As a gothic horror kind-of  post-apocalyptic fable, it was quite good.  However, as a sequel to Babe,  this movie left me bewildered and a little shocked.
First the good  points.  The effects are brilliant (i.e. the talking animals) and the sets  are interesting.  The use of animals to represent clans or tribes or races  and the conflict between them is not new, but is raised to a higher form  here than in the standard black-and-white Disney version, which is  appreciated by me as an adult.  The mood is consistent, the characters are  true to themselves, and you are drawn in to the story.  Visually (the  cinematography) it's very interesting.
But.....  While I applaud the  effort of filmmakers to try new things with sequels, this one goes too far.  This is not a children's movie.  It is genuinely scary, dark, and gothic.  It's irresponsible to use Babe's name to sell this picture to an audience  thinking it will be another delightful children's romp. It is even jarring  to an adult to be caught off-balance in this way.  Additionally, while  visually appealing, the story is pretty standard, and does degenerate into  silliness towards the end.
So, while I think this is an okay movie, I  don't have any particular desire to see it again.  And please be careful if  showing it to children.",968198400,3,1352,4.735930735930736

58744,5,078322561X,"Babe: Pig in the City is stunning and every bit as good as the original.  The two movies are poles apart however.  The humor in Pig in the City is  mostly dark and while there are many laugh outloud moments, the film is  weighted down with heavy philosophical and social implications.
The pit  bull bursting from the avalanche and his scene on hte bridge are great.  I  saw a lot of parallels with society in the animal house ( read animal  Farm.)  It seemed to me to be satire more than comedy.  The fight for  survival resulting in a kind-hearted leader whose kingdom is smashed by the  meddling neighbors seemed to me to have many meanings.  The smashing of the  goldfish bowl contrasting with the ""No one is going to get  hurt,""mantra chanted by the animal control officers was also amazingly  true of the world at large.  I also liked the symbolic facade of the  clothes Thelonius wore, even when they could be his downfall.
There were  also scenes of unprecendented majesty for such a film.  The reprise of  ""If I had words,"" was beautiful.  Hey , they even managed to  squeeze in ""That'll do pig.""  I still love JAmes Cromwell acting  ability but I'm glad he wasn't inthis one.  The tone of the film wouldn't  have meshed with his style.  In my opinion.
Best joke:  the city skyline.  You can see the Sydney Opera House, Eiffel Tower, Empire State Building  and more.  I laughed a lot about that.
Only one thing could be done to  make this movie better:  I wish Flealick had died.  I'm not cruel or  sadistic like someone has suggested.  I just think that the image of heaven  would have been that much more powerful had been more than a dream.  It was  wonderful none the less but still.  Well, that's my opinion anyway.  Summing up, Great movie, but you really might want to evalute your children  before letting them see this but let them see it sooner or later.  They  need it.",966384000,3,1888,4.471810089020772
58745,4,078322561X,"Films about animals always run the risk of being sickeningly sweet and sentimental or simply stupid. Babe, however, avoids these pitfalls with a kind of black-tinged, surrealist humor that makes us question the  philosophical underpinnings of the established barriers between humans and  animal.
The first Babe movie, anchored by the fine acting of James  Cromwell, was quaint and enjoyable, but Pig in the City surpasses this.  With Cromwell's farmer laid up in bed, it is the turn of his large Scottish  wife to take on the main human role as she ends up staying with Babe at an  unusual hotel in a strange city. The way in which city is presented is a  touch of genius. It is exaggerated and distorted beyond all reality, giving  the viewer perhaps the same impressions that an innocent country wife has  when visiting the urban jungle for the first time.
The stars of the  show, however, are of course the animals. As before, the 'duck' has some of  the best lines and the pig as always is endowed with a perky charm. But no  matter how well trained, these animals are limited in their thespian  capabilities. The movie succeeds by using animals that are naturally more  expressive, such as dogs and apes. The pit bull terrier, and Flealick, the  little crippled dog on wheels, were particularly effective.
The real  triumph of the movie, however, belongs to our nearest relatives in the tree  of evolution. The chimps and the orangutan whom Babe meets in the hotel are  incredible. Through a combination of training, special effects, and  skillful editing, they appear more human than human. Indeed, it wouldn't  have been unjust if the orangutan had become the first non-human to win the  academy award so expressive yet understated was his performance.
I've  noticed that other reviewers have mentioned the 'scariness' of the film and  how it has ""freaked out"" some of their tender little darlings.  All I can say is that those fragile young things had better be wrapped in  cotton wool and locked in the cupboard in case they see something really  shocking, like reality for instance, or a bacon sandwich. There have also  been complaints about the cruelty that may have been employed to get the  animals to perform as they did. Its alright to raise animals to slaughter  and eat them but we mustn't train them - this is a strange hypocrisy.  A  film like this, which wins so much human sympathy, can only help the cause  of animal rights.
This movie presents plenty to keep kids entertained,  unfortunately degenerating into overblown slapstick towards the end, but  there is also much that appeals to more adult sensibilities.",964224000,5,2636,4.862612612612613

Pig in the City is so different from the  original that the producers should have named it differently and put other  animals and characters in it. It is the worst sequel I have seen to this  date.

This falls under the category of not just sitting  your kids down in front of the TV. After a little explanation my son was  able to watch the rest of the movie and it is now one of his favorites. I  find the film no less dark than the first one and less so than Bambi. I  agree that perhaps the G rating is possibly a bit low but i do not think  PG13 would be appropriate either. This is a movie that I have watched over  and over (at least 20 times) and I still find new things that i have not  noticed the previous time. It is Beautifully filmed, and in general is a  piece of art. I will watch it at least 20 more times. A truly rare film  made on many levels.

If you're looking for a pablum-textured ""the world is a  wonderful place"" children's film, then skip it.  This is by no means a  children's movie, despite the ""PG"" rating.  This is a dark and  frightful story.  As I as watching it, I couldn't help but think that the  filmmakers were taking glee, sometimes sadistically so, in setting up scene  after scene in which animals were in danger.  Fortunately for us, there are  such modern technological gizmos as animatronics and computer graphics, so  there is reassurance that not everything you see is real.  It just seems  real.  Vividly real.  (People who cry that animals were surely harmed  during this movie need to read the end credits a little more closely.  The  magic of computers is everywhere.)
That out of the way, let's move on.  If you look at ""Babe: Pig In The City"" as an adult adventure  film, then it's a great edge-of-your-seat story.  The set designs are  elaborate, yet colorfully simple so they don't intrude and take over the  acting.  The script certainly packs a punch (repeatedly!), and is wonderful  at quickly bringing up emotions within the viewer -- you love, you hate,  and at times you absolutely loathe certain characters and situations.  But  you're never bored or uninterested.  There are hundreds of cute touches in  this film, from the cat chorus to the dog dream to the now-famous three  singing mice.
I can see why it bombed commercially; this is not a  film for everyone and the ""PG"" rating is slightly misleading.  But it's a great film that deserves more praise than it's gotten.

This is made all the worse due to the  fact that this movie is 10 million times better than Babe, and may be the  best talking pig movie ever made. EVER.
This movie is as much (if not  moreso) for adults as it is for kids, and it's reflected in the genius of  the script and the brilliance of the design. This movie is beautiful to  look at, and so crammed with visual ideas that to watch it only once is to  rob yourself of the dozens of small jokes stuck in the background.
This  movie is, as others have said, also a much darker movie, dealing with  death, persecution, bigotry, handicaps and animals in danger. But what's  the point of putting your child in front of the TV to watch a movie if your  child isn't going to LEARN anything except that autobots are good and  decepticons are evil. This movie is rife with morality and heart and I can  think of a million films that don't come close to the messages of this  movie.
Not only have the animal effects gotten better and more seamless,  but the animals are now the stars of the movie. In Babe, there was as much  to do with the humans as with the animals, but here, the animals clearly  take center stage. Monkeys, cats, dogs, fish....and each one is given a  personality: either throughout the film or just in the one or two lines  they give, you get the sense that if animals could talk, they'd be talking  like this.
So, if you've seen Babe and you haven't seen this, see it. If  you've never seen Babe, skip it and go right to this. This is George  Miller's finest film since The Road Warrior, and don't let anyone tell you  different. This...this is SPECIAL.",963792000,8,1804,4.338323353293413

However,  you might not be there when they encounter these same issues for the first  time as teenagers or (if you are really ""successful"" in isolating  them) as young adults.
Of course, ""Babe: Pig in the City"" is a  great film regardless of whether or not you want to show it to your  children. The movie is overflowing with emotion, atmosphere, and grace. The  cityscape which cobbles together every famous urban landmark. The cat  choir. The paranoid duck. The Gestapo-like animal police. The singing mice.  The champagne pyramid (which never falls!) The pit-bull rescue, which is  one of the most powerful scenes I have _ever_ seen. The gold-fish rescue.  The baby chimp rescue...
The set design is astonishing, the screenplay is  well-written, the effects support the story, and the dynamics between the  characters is pitch perfect (""Maybe cats and dogs can learn to get  along better..."")
Think of the scene where the crippled dog imagines  heaven, where he is chasing butterflies with his old cart discarded to the  side. The pure peace and hope of that moment is beyond words. Do not miss  this film!",963792000,12,1737,4.836734693877551
58766,1,078322561X,"My 2 year old loves the first Babe movie.  He is always asking for Babe.  With that in mind I bought the second movie thinking he would like it as well.  I put it on the top self of the closet as soon as we watched it for  the first and last time.  It is a poor movie, however its worst sin is that  it is not for young children.  A dog almost drowns hanging from a chain,  another dog with a cart is dragged by a truck and tossed to the side of the  road, and there is a very long sceen with the animals being rounded up by  evil looking animal control people.  This in not the light harted movie we  were looking for and our son will never see it again.  I am sorry I wasted  my money on it.",963792000,3,693,3.7552447552447554
58767,5,078322561X,"This film truly captures the joy and beauty that film is capable of.  The cinematography, the camerawork, the music, the characters... all are classic examples of what to do right in a film.  Some parents have slammed  this film for being too scary, but I think that by simply dismissing it  would be a loss because the film's beauty will work its magic on any  unsuspecting viewer.  This film is no more violent than some of those 80's  classic childrens films like ""the never ending story"" or  ""return to OZ,"" both of which received similar comments about  being too scary.  What is so fascinating about these films is that they can  appeal to both young and old viewers, which is not easilly done in the  realm of childrens films; some films are so much geared towards children  that adults feel alienated from them and avoid them with much effort.  Perhaps there will be some who don't wish to show this to their children,  but keep in mind that this film is destined to be a film/cult classic  because it is truly a beautiful film; honor it for the beautiful film that  it is.",963705600,3,1081,4.518134715025907
58768,5,078322561X,This is by far one of the best stories about dignity and respect for self and others that I have seen on film.  It is told in such a way that children and adults could learn volumes about the we should interact in our  world.  Most reviewers criticize the dark images of this film without  mentioning the positive results that happen when the characters learn from  their dark behavior and change for the better.  Most films teach through a  positive example where characters are one-dimensional and never change.  In  Babe: Pig in the City we see true enlightenment and self-discovery.  Bravo  to the entire production team.,963705600,,625,4.80188679245283
58779,5,078322561X,"The late Gene Siskel named ""Babe: Pig in the City"" as the best movie of the year.  One of his reasons was that it celebrated the joy of film making.  The story it tells is one about understanding who you are and  respecting others. A moral many people should take to heart.
If some  people believe the story of the film to be too violent and shows a  disrespect for animals, I would say in reply that it is the opposite.  Also, is there a life that does not have misfortune?  This film tells a  story about misfortune and shows that even if you are comming from a world  of mistrust you can find a common ground with others and even live in  peace, happily ever after.
The story is a charming one with a good deal  of humor but also, like any good comedy, has a few tears mixed in.",963705600,,781,4.105960264900662

The story just grew more complicated since it happened in the city and you see more characters(human as well as animals)as the story developed.  The movie is so full of actions and humours.  My daughter laughed so hard at several scenes and she watched it several times a week and each time she discoverd something new and wonderful in this story.  The movie was done in a stunning cinematic way, for the young audience it may be take some time to completely sunk in the story, but its gentle message should not be missed by anyone.

One of the darkest films I've seen in some time, almost along the lines of the Shawshank Redemption, being that the situation around Babe continually  degrades until the end. The film has such a wonderful style to it. It  probably has two of the coolest scenes ever made in a film, the first being  the scene with Thelonius standing in the stainglass window after Fugly is  taken away, and the other bring when the Doberman walks from the darkness,  making his little speech, it might as well been Pacino walking out in the  Godfather. Amazing. This is not a film for kids, and really should've been  aimed at adults, I can imagine this gave quite a few kids nightmares.

This is one of  those movies which creates a whole new world--on the order perhaps of  ""Time Bandits"" or ""Popeye"" or ""The  Borrowers.""

58801,5,078322561X,"I'm willing to excuse the vicious reviews this film recieved on its release as a huge misconception, you see poeple (reviewers)were expecting another retread of the charming 95 movie, in other words a cash in. What a  dis-service they have done everyone. You people who have not seen this film  have missed a beautiful, sad and masterful allegory. To me the film was  about immigrants, their struggles , the cynicism of living in a big city  (notice the ape family's indifference to the drowning dog).It's about  rascism and intolerance,expressed slyly in the opera loving animal hating  neighbours of the hotel at which babe stays . Yet you don't have to bother  with such complex themes if you don't care to as the film is visually rich,  every frame is a work of art(shot mostly at low angles with the camera  moving kinetically and gracefully). These oblique shots, the special  effects would make the film worth checking out on their own, but they  wouldn't even be worth mentioning had the film been not so moving. I will  never forget the seguence where babe saves the dog that was chasing him  from drowning, or saving the dieing fish by spitting it into the river. I  realise I'm blabbering but I'm actually quite bitter at all those critics,  they contributed a great deal to this films financial failure and thus the  film was not even released overhere cinematically(I just saw it on  video).To me this film is a noble immigrant's tale written like a novel by  Charles Dickens, performed by the one and only Babe and directed by Goerge  Miller. I don't even care ""who the film is suitable for"", that is  irrelevant, it is purely and simply a shamefully overlooked masterpiece.  Babe was wonderful film, this one is completely different and all the  better for it.""That'll do Pig"", indeed it will.",947376000,42,1808,4.783171521035599
58802,1,078322561X,"We received the original ""Babe"" as a gift for our then 1 1/2 old daughter who immediately fell in love with the whole thing. She watched it so many times that we ended up having to buy a new copy!  So when this  movie was released, my husband and I were excited that a new SWEET Babe  story was going to be available for her.
When it was released on video, I  immediately rented it. Thank God I watched it first without my child. The  opening scenes where the farmer is horribly injured from a piece of  machinery accidentally dropped onto him by the pig were incredibly  disturbing. It just got worse from there. While watching this, I found  myself thinking about those people who slow down to view a traffic  accident.  (You know that you shouldn't, but you can't help yourself.) It  was the same with this movie.  I continued to watch, merely to see just how  bad it was going to get. I was not disappointed! My favorite part is where  the farmer's wife gets busted as a suspected drug dealer (please note the  sarcasm). GREAT family fare..Not only shouldn't this be viewed by children,  but I don't recommend it for adults, either.  Whoever wrote the screenplay  must have been horribly bored with the first movie, and thus thought it  quite a hoot to rip the story apart in the second. They succeeded. To me,  this was quite a shame.  There are few movies of quality out there for  families as it is.  If I want to watch a cynical and jaded movie, there are  others out there that are better written. This is just another ripoff piece  of Hollywood schlock, made by folks trying to make some money off the  success of the first movie.

58805,1,078322561X,"I bought this and brought it home thinking it might be a good movie to have on hand for my grandaughter. In the first moments of this video I decided whoever thought this was a movie for kids was either crazy, or had  a very misplaced sense of what children would like.
The first few scenes  after Pig and his owner are back home are horrible. Pig's owner is going  down the well to repair it, he and the pig both fall in, the pump falls on  the man, you don't know if he is dead at first, then find out he is  terribly injured. It was a frightening scene. Then come the sinister  looking men in dark clothes coming over the hill. They are from the bank  and have come to take away their farm/home.
Follow that with the wife's  trip with the pig to the city where the wife gets detained at the airport  and questioned and threatened. The pig sits alone and hungry and wondering  where his owner is. Then it goes on with an overwhelming sense of bad  things that can happen. They get stranded in a strange place, her suitcase  gets stolen, the pig gets lost, and taken by a bunch of performing animals.  There is a fire in an orphanage. A man dies. Cme ON, all this in the first  few minutes and this is supposed to be for kids?  I was disappointed, and  even a bit angry and the audacity of this movie, and its makers.

First saw it when I was taking a group of youngsters to whom I am related to see the sequel to Babe.  Babe won the big award and it is nice and cute and all, but did not really foreshadow this.  I was sitting in the theater--I remember this very distinctly--wondering if I was imagining what I was seeing.  ""Do they know what they are doing here?  Is this all in my imagination and is it just going to fall apart?""  But it didn't.  It is a wonderful, deeply sensitive parable.  And having Edith Piaf in the soundtrack is just exceptionally satisfying gravy.  I didn't know until I read some of the reviews of this when I was looking to find the blue ray that Siskel and Ebert described it as ""one of the best movies of the year.""
