5006059,5,B006MOYGYE,"My daughter and I started watching it and have completely fallen in love with it. It has now been preordered.
I have read, in different places, some criticisim about it being unrealistic and it really is. The lead actress should be the belle of the high school and what high school student wears shoes like that and runs in them everywhere? LOL. The mean are really beautiful and mean and the nice are really beautiful and nice.
BUT, if you just want good clean fun, this is the show for you. Not only do we DVR it, this is also the only show that we make a point of being in front of the TV when it comes on.
Don't look for deep meanings to life. Just enjoy :D",1328745600,16,661,4.131782945736434

5006089,5,B006MOYGYE,"I enjoyed the story line of this show.  There is so much trouble on TV constantly in your face, that I enjoyed a smart fashionable, young girl making her way thru the high fashion world with style and doing an excellent job at that.

5006098,5,B006MOYGYE,"Just logged on to order my copy of Jane By Design. I see that the powers that be have elected to cancel one of the best shows on TV.  This show was a great example of what kids are juggling in their everyday lives and the pressures brought to bear.  Jane is a great kid who makes mistakes, picks herself up and does her best to rectify them.

This is the very best of a very good group.  (I would also highly recommend Secret Circles, Roswell, the Lying Game, Life Unexpected, Once Upon a Time, and Revolution.  Our daughter also likes Walking Dead and Prison Break, but they were not  really created for the same demographic.)",1367193600,2,434,4.733333333333333

5006106,5,B006MOYGYE,"this was one of the best shows on last year, so cute, witty and funny, I loved it!  the characters, the plot lines, the sexy actors (Nick Roux, David Clayton Rogers, Matthew Atkinson & Rowly Dennis)  such a great show!  if you liked the Devil Wears Prada, you will LOVE this show, but viewer beware!  the first season ends and leaves ya hanging, you can look up online what WOULD have happened had they been signed for a second season, but unfortunatley apparently the audience wasn't there....total bummer!  ahh-mazing show though!",1350432000,2,532,4.802197802197802
5006107,4,B006MOYGYE,"This show is sort of a rip off of The Devil Wears Prada, but so what.  It is fun, usually upbeat, and the characters are likeable.  One silly thing is that Jane is kind of average looking unlike Anne Hathaway (so the mostly female audience will like her) and goofy and irresponsible (except at work) but everybody on the show is in love with her and constantly hitting on her.  Somehow, she still has her virtue intact, as far as we know, anyway.",1349395200,,446,4.349397590361446
5006108,4,B006MOYGYE,"I am not a tween, teen or kid so maybe I am outside the demographic this show was trying to appeal to.  The thing is, I enjoyed the fairy tale premise, the writing and the ethic:  the characters all work hard whether at being a ditz, the most popular chick in high school or, ultimately, Jane with high school homework and adult responsibilities and Billie, working hard to be her friend, her best friend.  I don't get the network lazy ethic for killing shows with imagination and originality like this one.  It happens again and again:  a few episodes don't quite get their footing in the ratings and chop goes the block before anything more can develop.  Jane by Design deserved more episodes and another season, at least.  As unlikely a juxtaposition as the two lives she is trying to lead, the lead actress creates a sense of compassion about both.  You know she is always in over her head everywhere and you feel her ""fish out of water"" dilemma.  It hurts to be a teenager sometimes and Jane is no exception no matter how fabulous a life she has constructed for herself. New York City and a fashion house as character works well and puts Jane's life over the top:  the sheer energy and fashion elan contrasts well with the normalcy of a life in suburbia, albeit with an older brother as parent figure.  So, here's the thing:  this is a fantasy, yes, but with a moral underpinning that could only be considered valuable to the demographic ABC was trying to appeal to (I am assuming) - the teen, young adult, tween kids who could not receive a better message of hard work, creativity and vulnerability.  Shame on the hatchet people from the network for not seeing that.",1348358400,,1672,4.551839464882943
5006109,5,B006MOYGYE,"i absolutely loved this show! i totally looked forward to it every tuesday night. i would even be at work thinking that i hope i would get off in time to get home to watch this. luckily i always did. i stayed caught up and i was just hooked instantly. it was sure something to look forward to. then i find out that it got cancelled maybe the week after the season finale. whats this? i don't understand why the great shows get cancelled right away after one season for no reason and then totally stupid shows like the secret life of the american teenager have been going forever. i mean that show is a total middle schooler soap opera. i mean seriously, everyone dated each other through out this shoe. i don't even have to watch it to notice this. watched the very first episode of it and knew it was going to be totally stupid. how does it stay on tv, but no jane by design? it appeals to almost everyone. it seems i can't look forward to anything anymore without the slightest chance of it being cancelled. otherwise i feel like i am getting my hopes up.
this show was truly terrific. i hope ABC Family realizes their mistake somewhere here.",1348185600,,1144,4.350467289719626

5006112,4,B006MOYGYE,"I just watched this streaming on Netfl*x and I'm hooked. I really like this show and I think there's plenty of story lines to be explored in more seasons. Like stories around Gray and Jane's mother. The addition of Teri Hatcher is wonderful.
I love that this show is clean and doesn't have constant backstabing. It's just fun and the actress who plays Jane, Wow, quelle surprise! Sassy, witty, and eye candy all around,keep up the good work.

Oh, and teanagers who can interact with each other without having or talking sex, what a concept! Who knew?",1344902400,,550,4.670103092783505
5006113,5,B006MOYGYE,"My daughters and I started watching this show and just fell in the love with the weird quirky characters.
People decribe us as quirky and weird so maybe thats why we just laugh and adore it so.
It is really difficult to find shows where the content isn't questionable, But knowing that even my 11 year old daughter can watch this with me and her sister is really nice.",1341273600,,368,4.3478260869565215
5006114,4,B006MOYGYE,"This is a cute show!

I enjoy the casting (except for Andie MacDowell, but fortunately her part is very small) and I like the characters.  I also enjoy seeing the outfits (although Jane started off having much more imaginative outfits and tapered off - I'd like to see that reversed a little as she's gotten a bit mainstream)

The story lines are a bit predictable -- in each episode there is a crisis Jane narrowly escapes [most sitcoms we grew up on were formulated this way; I Dream of Jeanne, I love Lucy, The Dick Van Dyke show, Eight is Enough, Gilmore Girls, etc.]-- but that's not why you watch the show - you watch because you enjoy the characters and the cast who portrays them. Oh - and for the fashion

5006115,5,B006MOYGYE,"I've been watching this show on TV, and I'm sure it's even better on DVD without the commercial interruptions. Although the main character is a high school girl, any woman of any age who loves fashion & sewing will enjoy Jane's creativity and her approaches to getting out of the work & school predicaments she finds herself in.

Jane by Design is part humor and part fashion. Older viewers will particularly get laughs out of Jane's interactions with her demanding female boss. Anyone who's worked in an office with a demanding boss can enjoy the humor in the over-the-top assignments and unexpected work situations. The supporting characters, especially Jane's best friend, his girlfriend, and Jane's rival at work, are fun to watch.

If you enjoy fashion, want something to watch that is relaxing and not too serious, you'll enjoy this show. I'm looking forward to seeing future seasons.",1338854400,2,890,5.006756756756757

She has all kinds of problems going back and forth between her job and high school, and her best friend helps her pull it off. But a woman called India really has it in for her and is always trying to bust down Jane. Real mean. But Jane always manages to win in the end. Yay Jane!

5006117,2,B006MOYGYE,"Not a fan of this show.

Honestly, cute lovely show but.. every episode is the basically the same. Over and over. I felt like the entire first season was a big circle, to start and end in similar places. (Not quite, so no spoilers.) Above everything else, completely unrealistic. Of course the idea (and plot) are, but how everything functions in every episode left me going ""That would never happen?"". That's probably why this is a TV show but I always think characters need to be relatable. Jane was to, cookie cutter in that stereotypical character that's a huge 'trendsetter that no one realize she's brilliant' kind of way. Cute show, but didn't live up to my expectations. I wanted to love this show I really did. I also personally can't get over the fact that when it comes to 'fashion' that means sporting some seriously weird looking clothes, hair, and accessories. Along with Jane, who's creative and fun, wore the same style every single time we saw her. I get it, she has a tiny waist and likes skirts but can you find other types of outfits Miss Fashionista?",1335830400,,1071,4.636842105263158
5006118,4,B006MOYGYE,"What happens when a teenager lands her dream job to work in the fashion industry by accident?

This is the premise of the new ABC Family series ""Jane By Design"" created by April Blair (""Private Valentine: Blonde & Dangerous"", ""Lemonade Mouth"") and starring Andie MacDowell (""Groundhog Day"", ""Short Cuts"", ""Sex Lies and Video Tape"", ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"") and featuring actress Erica Dasher(""The Lake"").

The series revolves around teenager Jane Quimby (played by Erica Dasher), intelligent and dreams of working in the fashion industry after high school. But Jane and her best friend Billy Nutter (played by Nick Roux, ""Lemonade Mouth"", ""Wizards of Waverly Place"") are looked at as the odd balls in high school and quite often, Jane is ridiculed for her fashion sense by the most popular girl at school, Lulu Pope (played by Meagan Tandy, Miss Califoria 2007).

Jane lives with her older brother Ben (played by David Clayton Rogers), who quit his dream to become a professional baseball player in order  to raise his younger sister.  But unfortunately due to the tough economy, Ben has had difficulty in finding a full-time job and now they are behind on bills.

For Jane, she knows that her older brother is having a difficult time and she doesn't want them to lose the house.  So, knowing that she needs to raise money, she figures that since it's her final year in high school, she should prepare in looking for a job, but while she is still in high school, she can intern for a company in the fashion industry for now.

Jane applies for an internship at Donovan Decker and during her interview, human resources unfortunately mixes her up with an application for an internship for a job as an assistant to work for Gray Chandler Murray (played by Andie MacDowell), a world famous designer at Donovan Decker.  So, Jane Quimby is mistaken as a qualified adult applicant as the assistant for world famous designer, receives a salary of $34,000 and working the dream job...illegally.

An immediately, Jane's presence at Donovan Decker has been nothing but good luck to Gray and Donovan Decker..

But as Jane tries to live a double life, she finds herself trying to maintain her high grade point average, starting to develop a close relationship with the star baseball pitcher in high school and also trying to take part in school activities, but at the same time having to balance this secret life working at Donovan Decker, in which Gray is quite demanding and expects a lot from Jane.  Which includes leaving school and home to take on activities and even traveling around the world.

But how long can Jane Quimby keep up the charade before people start to find out?

VIDEO, AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Jane by Design: Volume One"" is presented in widescreen (1:78:1) and Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. I have to say that ""Jane by Design"" is possibly one of the most impressive looking ABC Family drama series out there.

For one, there are a lot of outdoor scenes, also...you don't really get to see the stars leaving a set to go to Paris and video being shot in those locations.  Because so many fashion icons have cameo appearances in ""Jane by Design"" (as they interact with Gray supposedly in other countries), it made me wonder if the series tries to film a lot of these industry professionals during various fashion week locations.

But ""Jane By Design"" is the best looking and stylish ABC Family series I have seen thus far.  From location shots (the set for Donovan Decker is cool), the runway set, the costume and set design, everything really comes together for this series and it's a quality you expect from a major network.  But pleasantly surprised to see how much ABC Family has put into this series and it works!

Nevertheless, the set design is pretty awesome and overall, picture quality is great as one can expect on DVD.  Audio is understandable, clear and heard no hiss or any audio problems whatsoever.  If anything, this is a solid DVD set that I wish it was released on Blu-ray, because it looks good.

JUDGMENT CALL:

A delightful drama series that captivated me from its stylish presentation, it's clever and enjoyable storyline, its cool characters but also in ABC Family style, manages to maintain that family aspect with the world of fashion.

At first, I was skeptical about ""Jane by Design"".  For one, it's a big stretch when the storyline revolves around a high school teenager mistakenly hired to become an assistant for a world-famous designer.  But the more I watched the episodes of this series, I found quite a bit of positives of why this drama is working and why I couldn't stop watching it.

For one, the series manages to capture locations, set design, costume design very well.  The addition of Andie MacDowell is a plus, as the model/actress brings some depth and maturity to the series, but also to make things feel a bit more believable is the number of cameo appearances by those who work in the fashion industry.  You see this often in film, but for a network TV series, not often.  And for an ABC Family series, I was surprised about how much was put into the actual style, design and overall look to this series.

I enjoyed the chemistry between the characters, best friends Jane and Billy, these two almost act like a couple, but they're not. Erica Dasher and Nick Roux definitely bring a synergy to this series.  Also, it was great to see actress/singer India de Beaufort (of ""Krod Mandoon and the Flaming Sword of Fire"") in this series and she does a great job of playing the co-worker rival at the workplace and also enjoyed the quirkiness of Jane's big brother Ben (played by David Clayton Rogers).  And as the series develops, we are starting to see more and more characters being developed.

Also, a major plus is the fact that characters are able to explore other worlds, where many other ABC Family series tend to focus within a circle.  I love the fact that this series often introduces a new character, may it be a socialist, a party rockin' teenage fashion model, etc.  Also, I love the fact the series also features characters of various ethnicities, also that these characters actually have an impact on the series and are not just there for politically correctness.  I enjoyed the Ben and Rita storyline and also the Lulu and Nick storyline as well.  But it'll be interesting to see how these characters come into play for the second half of the first season (and future seasons).

Another thing I love about the series is its featuring of a variety of locations.  Typically when you watch an ABC Family series, there is a banality of where shots usually take place.  Often inside a home, a gymnasium, at a school and while ""Jane By Design"" does retain that, we get to see these characters outdoors or at variety of locations.  I was surprised to see Jane in Paris, I was surprised to see how much attention to detail when it came to creating the set for runways and even the office of Donovan Decker, I was surprised to see a diner location, a restaurant location, hotel location, etc.

And so far, I have enjoyed each of the ten episodes of ""Jane by Design"".  They are well-written, the characters are fun and I absolutely love the drama that is featured and that it gives various characters their own storyline which is allowed to develop overtime., instead of being support characters that have no impact on the show or its overall storyline.  It's been a criticism of mine when it comes to ABC Family series, in the fact that you have so many characters, why not utilize them?  Fortunately, ""Jane by Design"" and ""The Lying Game"" are two series that are able to utilize their ensemble cast effectively and I like that a lot!

But where an ABC Family series such as ""The Lying Game"" is able to extend various mysteries of its many characters overtime, for ""Jane by Design"", how long can this charade last for Jane Quimby?  It's one thing to see her balance this secret life and being a high school teenager but it can only last so long.  While I can see this double life existing for the protagonist for another season, it's not something that can be stretched out for many years.  So, it will be interesting to see how writers contend with this in the future.

I also want to emphasize that this no TV version of ""The Devil Wears Prada"".  Sure, there is a protagonist who runs around running many errands and has a straightforward boss and yes, it has its share of ""backstabbing"" but it does maintain the ABC Family standard of teen life, teen relationships, family relationships and so on.

As for the DVD, PQ and AQ are good as one can expect on DVD.  It's one of series that I wish it was on Blu-ray but for what its worth, the DVD looks and sounds very good and fans of the series, or those curious should be happy with the overall quality.

There are no special features, which is surprising as many ABC Family drama series do come with a featurette or some sort of special feature include on DVD.  But  considering this is volume one of ""Jane by Design"" and another second half of episodes still left to air on television, I'm really enjoying this series so far.

Overall, I have to say that I'm impressed with ""Jane by Design"". The characters, the storyline, the set and costume design, even the various locations that this series is shot, it's working and I hope they can continue this synergy.

Delightful, captivating and fun, ""Jane by Design: Volume One"" is definitely recommended!",1335571200,3,9643,4.6876484560570075

We spent a pleasurable season wondering, hoping, planning, imagining, and now where are we? Waiting for the second season that will never come. I'm sorry it took so long to discover the existence of 'Jane By Design.' It's one of the better teen television series I've seen. I'm no teen! Yet, I still found myself  binge-watching because I was sure I knew where the office intrigues were headed and the fates of the young loves at the high school.

Now, I'll never know. Better to have watched and wondered than to never have watched at all - or something to that effect!",1520726400,,689,4.725
