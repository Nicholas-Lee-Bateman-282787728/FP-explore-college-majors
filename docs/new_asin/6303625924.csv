7852935,5,6303625924,"I never forgot seeing this many years ago on local PBS when my kids were tiny, and loving the music. It was never aired again in the Phila. area and local PBS had no record (or so they claimed) of any programming from that long ago. I actually found it listed on a UK TV schedule in 1982 which led me to a VHS tape released in 1995 .I was overjoyed to find it on Amazon at a great price and I've played it over and over since receiving the tape. (still have a VCR with a DVD player) Wish they would release this on CD. Happy, Happy!",1386460800,,532,3.935185185185185
