2611361,5,B000GH3CWK,"Sopranos wimped out the last few seasons. Brotherhood fills the need to see what organized crime can be like.

2611362,4,B000GH3CWK,"The more and more that Showtime is premiering new shows, the better they have been.  Maybe that's why some people are refering to Showtime as being a ""new HBO"" (although HBO isn't really HBO these days) with the list of new and original series' that have been very, very good.  You have the hilarious Weeds, the riveting Sleeper Cell, the horriffic and addictive Dexter, and the entertaining Masters of Horror to name a few, and you also have this political/gangster drama.  Brotherhood follows Irish-American politician Tommy Caffee (Jason Clarke), whose life gets thrown into upheaval when his long departed gangster brother Michael (the excellent Jason Isaacs) resurfaces.  As each battles for control over the Hill, we soon learn that there is really not much difference between the two brothers, and the line between good and bad becomes more and more blurred with each passing episode.  The supporting cast, including Fionnula Flanagan as the brother's controling mother and Annabeth Gish as Tommy's wife, are great, but it's veteran actor Jason Isaacs who is really the draw of the show, as he gives a masterful performance as one of the most subtley dangerous men to grace a series on Showtime.  There's a little uneven feel to the series, but that aside, there is a ton of potential here for Brotherhood to be something really, really special.  Comparisons to the Sopranos aside, Brotherhood is a treat.",1165881600,21,1412,5.034334763948498
2611363,5,B000GH3CWK,"This is such a great show; I would give it more than 5 stars if I could.  No, it's NOT an Irish Sopranos; some of the newspaper/magazine reviews were very dismissive in calling it so and I wonder if the reviewers really watched the show.  It's very complex (I love DVDs; perfect for watching episodes more than once) and, to me, not predictable.  My husband and I watch a lot of TV and we have not sat and discussed a show this much for years.  It has a great cast (it is so great to see actors like Jason Isaacs - my favorite actor by far - and Annabeth Gish playing such meaty parts) and the writing is excellent, WAY above what is usually seen on TV and in most Hollywood movies these days.  I was hoping for good things when I first heard about this show and I was not disappointed in any way, except that it was over too soon!  I look forward to Season 2 and hope they can keep the quality going; too many shows jump the shark in their second season and it would be a shame to see that happen here.  (This is my major complaint about most HBO shows - they lose their mojo in the second/third season - witness the recent debacle of ""Deadwood"", previously my favorite show.) Anyway, give this one a chance and I think you will find it very enjoyable.  Yes, it's violent and gritty and sometimes rather sad/depressing, but don't let that stop you from checking it out.  It can also be very touching at times.  Very high quality all the way around.",1164067200,31,1449,4.236363636363636
2611364,5,B000GH3CWK,"Unusual and unexpected location. Well done depiction of political scene with a background of serious and violent criminal activity involving some members of the family of one of the political players. Totally engrossing ! Well acted, scripted and directed. Perfect cast.",1163116800,2,270,5.609756097560975
2611365,3,B000GH3CWK,"I wish I could give this a 3.5 because it really is better than just a 3. The acting is great. Most of the accents are okay and this series has a decent storyline. It would have been nice if some of the characters were the type of people you could actually care about, but they're all self-centered and dishonest. The most interesting characters right from the beginning are Michael and Rose. Tommy gets more and more interesting as the series goes on. Overall a good series.",1159833600,,475,4.471264367816092
2611366,4,B000GH3CWK,"Very interesting movie.

Accents were fairly good although being from the Boston area myself, some were not believable.

Fionnula Flanagan Was great as the mother.

Jason Isaacs is one of my favorite actors.

I would watch this a second time and not be bored.",1159833600,2,259,4.818181818181818

AND GRITTY REALISM, PURCHASING THIS SET IS A ""NO-BRAINER.""

THIS WORK OF ART.

I HAVE NOT BEEN THIS IMPRESSED BY THE FIRST SEASON OF A SERIES, SINCE ""SIX-FEET UNDER"". HIGH PRAISE INDEED, BUT IT'S TRUE.

 JUST BEEN JOINED AT THE BAR BY ""BROTHERHOOD.""",1159401600,6,612,4.583333333333333
2611368,5,B000GH3CWK,"I began watching the Sopranos when it first came out in 1999.  However, once everyone began watching it, I soon lost interest.  When it was announced that Showtime was releasing its own crime drama, I was hesitant to watch the program because I thought the program would fall into the typical crime drama mold.

'Brotherhood' stands out on its own.  I don't think it's achieved the popularity of 'The Sopranos' yet, and I like it that way. 'Brotherhood' is gritty, violent, and intense, and I'm looking forward to the 2nd season.  While the show focuses on the political and criminal worlds of Providence, Rhode Island, I like how it also explores the changes that the Irish residents on 'the Hill' are experiencing (and also struggling with) on a daily basis.

I think that most viewers will say that Jason Isaacs (Michael Caffee) and Fionnula Flanagan (Rose Caffee) are the stars of the show. However, I believe that Jason Clarke (Tommy Caffee) is the real star of the show. Where has this guy been hiding?  In his first true starring role, Jason Clarke is excellent as the morally ambivalent, younger Caffee brother. Even though he is supposed to contrast with the older, violent Michael Caffee, we see that Tommy is no angel, and he often treads a fine line of good and evil himself within the world of Rhode Island politics.

The supporting cast (Annabeth Gish, Kevin Chapman, and Stivi Paskoski) is also very good, but it is Jason Clarke who stands out as the foundation of this show and all of the other characters.  Excellent first reason and I highly recommend it to someone that wants a good crime drama.  I'm hoping that some memorabilia from this show is made;  I'd love to have a shot glass that says 'Green Bar' or 'Mulligan's.'",1159228800,,1742,4.7161716171617165
2611369,5,B000GH3CWK,"Jason Isaacs is the perfect gangster.  He kills only the bad guys, not the good guys.  If you liked Scarface, or those other mobster mobies, this is one to add to your collection.  The Caffee's are brothers who shouldn't be.",1158451200,3,224,4.55

First, The Sopranos had ""heart"", there was something about the characters that you liked, even though they were the ""bad guys"", you couldn't help rooting for them. With Brotherhood there isn't any charm, or snap to this show it just seems to meander all over the place without any character development. After the first few episodes I hadn't developed a liking or concern  for any character. The writing is sloppy, the plots are hollow and the characters just seem flat.",1485302400,,567,4.845360824742268

2611606,5,B000GH3CWK,"I really enjoyed watching this series, even though it took me nearly ten years to discover it. I agree with another reviewer's remark saying that the quality of the writing seemed to have dropped off somewhere around the middle of the third season. To be honest, I think the first season is the best one, and the second was pretty interesting as well. I too am disappointed that Showtime cancelled this series after the third season.

Also, If you are from the Northeast USA, or you are interested in this area, maybe you will find this show interesting, I am from CT (near RI), so I can really appreciate the characters in this show, since they sort of remind me of people I know from RI with their accents and mannerisms. And it is fun seeing local landmarks that you recognize as well such as the RI state capital.. LOL @ everyone always drinking Dunkin Donuts in the show, and East Coast staple. Clever way to advertise, but also true. After watching the show, I am more interested in visiting Providence again.",1466553600,,1015,4.576923076923077

2611613,4,B000GH3CWK,"This is a great show and an excellent deal if you have Amazon Prime! I'm not a fan of how season one ends or how season two begins however, season one, in my opinion, is the best of them all. The last half of season three could have been much better; It's almost as if the writers were on auto pilot. That being said, the acting is so believable it's easy to forget you're not watching the lives of real people. I'm satisfied but not thrilled with the ending of the series. If you're a fan of THE SOPRANOS, I highly recommend giving it a shot and remember, character development takes a few episodes. In almost every series it takes time for the actors and writers to catch their groove.",1465948800,3,687,4.292307692307692

I'm deducting a star because the soundtrack has changed.

2612004,5,B000GH3CWK,"I had never seen or heard of Brotherhood until I saw it recently on Amazon. I was initially attracted because I enjoy Jason Isaacs work usually. What I found was a show that was well acted and well written and with all the PR on ""Black Mass"" and Whitey Bulger, also quite current. It is a little violent, but compared to so many other shows on TV these days it is not bad at all. I have not really noticed the language being too objectionable either. I am only half way through the season but the twists and turns so far have kept me coming back for more. The interplay between ""good"" brother politician (played well by Jason Clarke of the current Everest movie) and the ""evil"" mob brother is interesting. I particularly like the comparative study of the political organizations moves and manipulations versus the mobs actions. A lot of grey areas with very little pure good vs evil",1444262400,2,882,4.51875

There are a good many rewarding and engaging qualities to Brotherhood but at times it does feel like it's trying too hard. Let's be honest, Providence, a unique New England gem in it's own right, is not Boston nor New York and it's 'organized' crime has never been all that organized. In an attempt to meld the Departed w/ the Sopranos there are times when inevitable cliches and predictable outcomes occur and reoccur but then again those cliches are exactly what most people tune in for. I can't fault the writers too much for that but as a result the storyline gets a bit predictable on occasion and when the tempo starts to dirge the show can take on an discomforting shadowy pall. Still, I remain drawn in despite those few flaws.
As it so happens, I originate from the very area where Brotherhood takes place and was filmed so the show's use of local references and locations is warmly nostalgic. Providence PD getting 'the works' hot dogs from the Haven Bros, the quahog stuffies (w/out the corn please!), coffee-milk, grinders, cabinets, the Portuguese-American clubs, route 6 and the I-95, the famed state capital building, Pawtucket, Woonsocket, Newport, Cranston, Narragansett and even a piece of dialogue like ""You drove to Seekonk? That's all the way up in Massachusetts!!"" (it's just over the border) really brought me home.
Overall, Brotherhood has a compelling setup featuring two brothers, Michael and Tommy Caffe, who grew up on ""The Hill"" but find themselves as adults on opposite sides of the law; one a politician, the other a small-time Irish mobster. But they never let that interfere with their family dinners. One minor point that was a continual distraction for me was the actors' unsuccessful attempts at the Rhode Island dialect, which gets a little silly at times. Considering the two main stars are British and Australian they do a decent job and when you add that this dialect is a very particular 'in-between-Boston-and-New York' kind of patter who can really tell anyway? Okay. most anybody from Taunton to Mystic can, but I doubt the bulk of the viewers really care about that.
All in all, I think Brotherhood is well worth watching but don't expect Breaking Bad here, it's not quite at that level but it's very good and as an added plus you also get a pretty comprehensive look around the small but mighty ""Ocean State"".",1439078400,5,2602,4.823266219239374

2612092,2,B000GH3CWK,"It's interesting to watch Italian American Mafia/mob stories to see how they had the audacity to organized crime, take what wasn't their and hurl racist insults against minorities groups they often resembled in feature (guess who). So I wanted to learn how Irish people did the same sans the physical resemblance, and I  decided to give this series a try. Didn't like it. It's a Soprano wannabe series but with Irish people/mob who have a free pass to make racial insults against Black people & other races. Who knew that Rhode Island only had 1 Black official in the entire city? I would think that there would be other races than Irish people in the 21st century in Rhode Island. At least hire actors of different races and culture to walk by/in stores/in political office etc to make this town/storyline believeable! Two stars for giving me insight on how Irish Americans can be as thuggish, corrupt and racist as the Italian American
Mafia was.  The costume department must have saved tons of money on clothes because the actors looked like they rolled out of bed and put on what they wore the previous day or even from home! Michael's a big shot gangster who wears sneakers! Lol! And he wears a leather jacket from the '80s just about everyday when filming was done in the summer! Does a leather coat make you a ganster? Showtime thought so. Where does all the corrupt money go? Certainly not on their homes or for repairs in their home eg. Tommy couldn't run the A/C without it blowing a fuse. Come on! Where does his money go? And where does his wife get money to buy weed or coke if she doesn't work? Tommy is never seen giving her (or the kids) an allowance.

2612263,5,B000GH3CWK,I stumbled across this show and it sounded interesting. I'd seen Jason Isaacs in other shows and really like his work. When I read it was about two Irish brothers it piqued my interest. I was totally hooked from the beginning and watched multiple episodes every night. I had no idea how it would end--if it did have an ending or was cancelled. The last episode was totally satisfying. I liked how they tied up the loose ends. It was not your usual ending and I think the whole show was great.,1425081600,,492,4.358695652173913

Jason Clarke also did a top job as a willing-to-be corrupted equally small-time New England politician.

Blood all over, words you don't even say in real life and counter shenanigans in the one of the oldest states in the union. It's like listening to a Camaro at full throttle from the starting line. And then it gets going. So far, the show has me on sheer realism.

If you were to excise the 'f' word in all its iterations from the dialogue you might have a stretch to make this series fill 3 seasons.

The violence is a critical part of the movie and necessary-graphic at times, but I really want to like the brother that uses it. At times it is kind of a Charles Bronson ""Death Wish"" type scenario where he bashes in the bad guys. Then at other times he seems to lose his temper against the innocent. I was really wanting to like this show, no happy endings here. Nothing for me to feel good about at the end.

I guess the only thing for me is that sometimes the show lacks ""edge"" for some reason. The Sopranos and the Shield had ""edge"", sometimes we get it with Brotherhood but mostly not. I think it may be because it of the backdrop location of the show...I mean who would think and see Providence as a hotbed of criminal activity? Not dissing Rhode Island per se, just saying is all.

2612421,5,B000GH3CWK,"When Brotherhood first aired on Showtime, it crept onto the schedule so sheepishly, I figured it had to be a dud. Still, why not try it?  It started off very low-key, and kept coming back, but wasn't sure why.  Within a few episodes, it was blowing my mind.

In brief, it's the story two brothers in an Irish-controlled area of Providence, Rhode Island.  One brother has his eye on political power.  The other, always a hair's breadth from violence, has his sights set on power over the local mob. The story lines reach across their families, friends, associates, community and into the statehouse and back rooms of mob hangouts.  There's always an angle being worked by someone, a palm to grease, a relationship to smooth, a moral choice to make...or to stomp on.  My description sounds simplistic. The show is not

First, whether in a lead role or a walk-on, there isn't an actor in this show that isn't playing directly from the gut.  I don't mean emoting all over the place; I mean this cast rooted itself so deeply in these characters, that it's hard to remember they aren't real.  I didn't know the actors, with the exception of Fionnula Flanagan who, as the leonine matriarch, really shows her gift here. The seething intensity of Jason Isaacs, Jason Clarke and Annabelle Gish were revelations to me. Smaller roles, played by the likes of Brian O'Byrne, Kevin Chapman, Billy Smith, just to name a few, are equally memorable.

Of course, you don't get performances like these without superb writing, producing and directing. (If you're interested, a look at imdb reveals a list of writer/producers and film directors associated with groundbreaking TV and indie film).

The grip of this community on its characters is palpable.  Whether by overt design or by working a small production budget to great advantage, the sets tend to be small, the houses and local bars claustrophobic, which constantly reinforces the sense of the small world they're all scratching to conquer.

The characters are so well crafted, and the story lines so rich and full of possibility, that the series could have continued on for a lot longer without losing steam.  But Brotherhood appeared in the midst of a spate--a golden bubble--of extraordinary creativity and artistic accomplishment in television, from the cable channels to the broadcast networks. Was this just lost--as more than a few gems were--in an embarrassment of riches? Because, even with several awards, including a PEABODY!, Showtime continued to make so little noise about it, that I was surprised, relieved and grateful when it came back twice.

2612460,4,B000GH3CWK,"The Caffee brothers ,Tommy (Jason Clarke) and Mike (Jason Isaacs), are opposite ends of the spectrum even though they both grew up in the same Irish neighborhood of Providence, RI.  Tommy is a respected politician with ambition.  Mike is a low-life hoodlum with different ambition.  In between them, and neighbor to Tommy, is Mom, Rose Caffee (Fionnula Flanagan) trying to keep the peace and stir the pot at the same time.

Annibeth Gish plays Tommy's wife, Eileen.  Home with two daughters in Catholic School, Annibeth gets lonely and drifts to an old flame and pot.

Season One is pretty active with good story lines throughout.  All episodes, instead of being named, are based on a biblical scripture and verse(s).

For the record, Mark 8:36 - For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul? (KJV Bible).",1397174400,2,848,4.760273972602739

2612462,4,B000GH3CWK,"I really really like this series.  The characters were well developed and almost to the point that you felt like you knew them.  Didn't necessarily have to like them, but you got to accept each for who they were.",1397088000,,212,4.410256410256411

2612466,5,B000GH3CWK,"I'm disappointed that 5 stars is all I can give this series...it deserves so much more.  A riveting story of two brothers...good versus evil...right versus wrong...justice versus injustice.  But not  all is black and white...the line blurs as you watch how each brother deals with family problems, competitive colleagues and political wrangling.  Once I started watching, I couldn't stop!!",1396396800,,389,5.5423728813559325

2612468,5,B000GH3CWK,"This is such a great show; I would give it more than 5 stars if I could. No, it's NOT an Irish Sopranos; some of the newspaper/magazine reviews were very dismissive in calling it so and I wonder if the reviewers really watched the show. It's very complex (I love DVDs; perfect for watching episodes more than once) and, to me, not predictable. My husband and I watch a lot of TV and we have not sat and discussed a show this much for years. It has a great cast (it is so great to see actors like Jason Isaacs - my favorite actor by far - and Annabeth Gish playing such meaty parts) and the writing is excellent, WAY above what is usually seen on TV and in most Hollywood movies these days. I was hoping for good things when I first heard about this show and I was not disappointed in any way, except that it was over too soon! I look forward to Season 2 and hope they can keep the quality going; too many shows jump the shark in their second season and it would be a shame to see that happen here. (This is my major complaint about most HBO shows - they lose their mojo in the second/third season - witness the recent debacle of ""Deadwood"", previously my favorite show.) Anyway, give this one a chance and I think you will find it very enjoyable. Yes, it's violent and gritty and sometimes rather sad/depressing, but don't let that stop you from checking it out. It can also be very touching at times. Very high quality all the way around.",1395878400,,1439,4.236363636363636

2612471,5,B000GH3CWK,"The real value of Amazon Prime is that it allows you to watch the really good TV shows in order and close enough to remember and understand what's going on.  Brotherhood is great TV drama on the order of Sopranos or The Wire or OZ.  I watched it faithfully when it aired but on watching it straight through here I realize that I hadn't seen as much of it, or as well as I thought.  This is a gritty drama that explores the darkside of politics, organized crime and family life.  The characters are engaging if not particularly sympathetic.  Great TV is rare, this is a great series and I hope this is not the last time I can watch it from start to finish.",1395014400,,655,4.208
2612472,3,B000GH3CWK,It's good but a little dark. I wish there was one character that was we could root for because they were trying to do the right thing. I also wish there was more depiction of legislative process.,1394496000,,195,4.297297297297297

2612476,5,B000GH3CWK,This show is an interesting take on how two brothers who appear to be nothing alike use completely different means to try and help the neighborhood which they grew up in... or is it themselves they are trying to help? The line between good and bad is often blurred and sometimes it's hard to know who you're rooting for. Definitely worth a watch.,1394236800,,346,4.507936507936508
2612477,4,B000GH3CWK,I liked this story because of its relationship or similarities to the Whitey Bulger case out of Boston where Whitey was a gangster and his brother was a member of the state House of Reps. Some of the scenes are quite graphic though and the language is sometimes crude.,1394150400,,268,4.489795918367347

2612487,2,B000GH3CWK,"I watched it all.  I guess I don't feel robbed of my time, but it sure did not leave me with anything I would call enriching.  Basically, it's a story of a bunch of degenerate Irish Politicians and gangsters trying to get over on everyone and everything they can.  Most interesting parts to me were the on-site shots of the Capitol.

As far as I'm concerned, there are better things to watch, but if you are like me and need to have some background noise on all the time, it will do.  But hey...I could be wrong.",1392940800,,512,4.237113402061856

Set in Providence, RI, Brotherhood is about a dysfunctional Irish family.  One brother is a state legislator, Tommy, and the other is a gangster, Michael.  In addition to the mob business, this show adds political corruption.  There is plenty of nudity, sex and F-wording to rival the Sopranos.

Like the Sopranos, you get to know the characters and, possibly care about them.

If you miss the Sopranos, try this.  Definitely for mature audiences.",1392422400,,561,4.956989247311828

However I watched only three episodes before deciding to turn it off because the subject matter turns me off. Amazon has been asking for a review, so I'll say if you enjoy watching  the demise of a dreary working class neighborhood in the post-industrial economy where corrupt union bosses and their mob counterparts grapple for construction contracts, where politicians, despite their possibly initial good intentions, play dirty and become drunk with power, where intelligent men live by crime and violence instead of uplifting themselves, and succumb to the same even when they do because they can't let go of the criminal mentality they grew up with , then this show is for you.

For a Chicagoan like myself, it was too reminiscent of the historical Bridgeport, a blue collar Irish neighborhood, which gave birth to the Chicago machine, the corrupt, ethnically based patronage system which produced five city mayors.

produced by HBO. The point being it was not promoted well at all. I'm not going to say this
is in the league of ""The Sopranos"". But I will say that had ""The Brotherhood"" had the same marketing
as HBO shows it would have been a hit. Instead of a forgotten Cable TV Show. The Acting was fantastic. The storylines
interesting.

References to real political issues, real town stereotypes, real Providence mafia history make you feel like you are in an alternate but plausible universe. The Rhode Island accents are extraordinarily hard to do, and were better achieved in general by the non-American actors, probably because they came with no expectations. But local pronunciation was generally pretty good, and nobody makes the egregious mistake of calling Pawtucket ""PAA-tuckit"" the way the heroine did in the much less interesting series ""Providence"".

I think we were meant to have a love/hate feeling toward Michael but he was not likeable and the 3rd season I was hoping someone would just kill him off. Tommy is very manipulative. Eileen is a slutty lush. Rose is needy & manipulative towards her children.  I did watch all 3 seasons but was left disappointed.

Every scene is in sequence, about someone on the take, one way or the other, literally or figuratively. One scene props the next scene up and there is no real plot. And much of what happens is either insipid or taxes the imagination. So much for story-arc.

Characters? I don't think so. The characters are not very interesting. They fulfill the role of whatever stereotype of cynical politician, petty crook, socio-pathic gangster, emotionally ambivalent wife, vixen with a borderline personality, or hapless victim the writers had in mind. But don't miss the point. They all have a good heart, naturally.

Just about everything else is dreary. Maybe that is the point: Life is dreary and the show is an imitation of life.

The setting, Providence RI, lags behind the middle counties of England for the number of homicides per week, but is far ahead of said counties in mutilation, mayhem and blood. Folks! This is Providence RI, not Chicago in the heyday of the Irish mob! The writers had a lot of catching up to do.

Well I gave up when a guy in a poolroom wouldn't move outta da way and got his face bashed in widda pool stick. Gimme uh break!",1367625600,5,1399,4.788381742738589

Shot on location, the show features top-notch production values and beautiful cinematography. However, the series still manages to maintain a very gritty and realistic approach. The narrative is overflowing with themes of machiavellianism, moral corruption, and redemption. The writing is smart without being pretentious or condescending. And all the characters are superbly developed over the three season story arc that originally aired on Showtime. Be warned though, the show is definitely not for viewing with mixed company, as it has an abundance of nudity, profanity and violence. But, in all honesty, that's part of the show's appeal.

The series revolves around two brothers, one an aspiring and idealistic politician with what seems to be the perfect family life, and the other, a ruthless thug who resurfaces after a seven year absence. The brothers intentions are constantly at odds, and there's only room enough for one of them to stay ""on the Hill"".

The show has some very fine ensemble episodes - for me, the first was an episode that concludes the first season and takes place entirely during a wedding reception. The second was an episode that involves Thanksgiving day. Both were excellent from start to finish. They tried the same formula less successfully with a ""Labor day"" episode.

The problem I had with this show was aside from the main theme of the conflict between Tommy and Michael, there was a good deal of inconsistency in the series. Some plot threads would go nowhere or felt forced, and some character alliances would flip too many times to be believable. The flimsy continuity between the excellent ending episode of the first season and the first episode of the second season was hard to believe.

The series has an ending, but I think a lot of fans were left hoping for more closure.

The flimsy continuity between the excellent ending episode of the first season and the first episode of the second season was hard to believe.

The series has an ending, but I think a lot of fans were left hoping for more closure.

2612654,5,B000GH3CWK,"Many have labeled ""Brotherhood"" an Irish ""Sopranos"" and have likened the political aspects to ""The Wire"", and both are legitimate comparisons. In addition, some have criticized the premise of the series, that the idea of having yet another show about wiseguys, and one with the focus on a pair of brothers, one outside the law and one firmly ensconced within it, has been done to death. I'd say that just being mentioned in the same breath with legendary shows like The Sopranos and The Wire is reason enough to take notice of Brotherhood.

I would also suggest that Brotherhood is not a ripoff of either series, but a brilliantly conceived and executed, fresh and original, contemporary morality tale. The reason I say that is that the writing, characters, situations, dialogue, art direction and photography are all top-notch, engaging, original and very credible. Even though the series tends to be dark and fairly violent, there are moments of supreme humor, which to me makes a series or movie so much more believable and entertaining. Besides unimaginative characters and writing, which leads to cliches, one of the foremost traits of a bad work of art is that it takes itself so seriously, leaving no room for humor. Also, thus far I have thankfully not glimpsed any scenes of a kindly, avuncular Irish parish priest, with a thick brogue, gently castigating any of the Caffees for their imperfect church attendance.

There are a host of very professional actors at work here. The notable Brit actor Jason Isaacs does a wonderful job with the Eastern US accent, and is the personification of dangerous volatility, as black sheep Michael Caffee. Jason Clarke plays his younger politician brother Tommy, idealistic and ambitious but not above making backroom deals and even using extortion to get things done. Fionulla Flanagan is terrific and perfectly cast as their feisty mother, willing to look the other way at times, still working in a factory but looking to retirement.

Annabeth Gish is Tommy's beautiful stay-at-home wife, mother of three girls, bored and addicted, having it off with the mailman. The short and stocky Kevin Chapman has cornered the market in nasty Irish thuggery [see Mystic River], but here he has moved up to the role of Freddy Cork, captain of his own crew. He is not at all pleased when the just-as-tough Michael turns up again after a 7-year absence.

I was reminded of the real-life saga of the Bulger brothers of Boston, MA. James (""Whitey"") was the older gangster, and the younger William was the politician.

As a visual artist I have a deep appreciation of the series' use of the beautiful overhead shots of the city as well as the wonderfully detailed interiors of the homes.

All-in-all, a great series, highly recommended.",1308528000,,2766,4.963282937365011
2612655,5,B000GH3CWK,"Ultraviolent, profane and brutally terrific saga of an old Irish neighborhood in Providence on the brink of extinction in the modern world. Creator Blake Masters creates the ultimate hidden gem - a gritty saga of organized crime, loyalty, adultery and political corruption served up spiced with plenty of gangster violence,sex & drugs. Providence gangster Michael Caffee (Issacs) comes home to his old neighborhood in 'the Hill' section of the city after a 7-year absense (a common theme in Irish Mob stories, State of Grace and Southie come to mind). Immediately he reconnects with his close-knit family, past flames, and local hoodlums. Michael has his eyes set on retaking the Irish criminal rackets run by icy Freddie Cork (a masterful Chapman), as his politician brother Tommy Caffee (Clarke) tries to remain ambitious. Tommy's wife (a very easy-to-look-at and terrific Gish) experiences some demons of her own. Ethan Embry also gives a superb and hilarious performance as Declan Giggs, a RI State cop investigating his own childhood friends from the Hill. The entire cast and setting bring this Celtic crime drama to life and by the second season it goes into absolute full-throttle til the very end. Highly recommended.

""Whereas the Italian Mafia was a private club, the Irish Mob was more of philosophy, a shared social contract characterized by a loosely-connected sphere of influence in which the underworld and the upperworld intersected under the guise of the lawman, the politican, and the gangster"". - T.J. English, author of 'Paddy Whacked' and 'The Westies'

Initially, it seemed a mish-mash of The Wire, The Sopranos, and a little dash of The Shield (and I'm not saying I don't love each of those series as well, but I wasn't feeling anything ""new""), but it has developed into its own powerful entity that is almost completely independent of anything else.

This has turned into one of my favorite shows - the depth of acting and the complete lack of judgement about the actions of the players. Jason Isaacs is amazing, as the psychotic yet loyal gangster, and Kevin Chapman is pure, vicious evil as the mob boss Freddie.  Acting is Brotherhood's strong point, and it is refreshing to find a show so well put together, and a shame that we as viewers don't find this often, or demand that drama have this kind of character development.

A truly 5-star show.",1223251200,,945,4.568047337278107
2612667,5,B000GH3CWK,"Ever since I started working in television back in summer 2000, my actual TV viewing for leisure has become rare. It's not by choice, but a problem with time. I actually love the boob tube, and occasionally I catch a show or two when I get the chance. But many viewers and critics argue that pay cable television is where today's best programs are. That is where a major problem lies for me. I've been on the outs with pay cable for many years now.

Then came the recent TV on DVD explosion. Now I'm catching up.

The first season of Showtime's Brotherhood aired in summer 2006. Since the DVD set was released in late September of the same year, the cable giant wasted no time in putting this into the hands of fans and newcomers like me. It is a smart move. With 11 good episodes and a cliffhanger season ender, it almost makes me want to subscribe to Showtime just to see how the story resolves.

The show follows the lives of two brothers in the Providence, Rhode Island Irish-American neighborhood known as ""The Hill"". It's a blue-collar neighborhood with roots in old-world ways of street justice and shady dealings. Tommy Caffee (Jason Clarke) is a family man and local politician who is out to protect the community and its best interests. His world is turned around when his gangster brother Michael (Jason Isaacs) returns to ""The Hill"" after a seven-year absence to regain control of the seedy underworld.

Many reviewers have compared the show to The Sopranos, describing it as a ""lower-middle class"" Sopranos. That may be a perfect comparison, but I have never watched the Emmy-winning former, so I haven't the basis to make such comparison. But the drama is good. The writing and performances make you question who the 'good' guys and 'bad' guys really are. You actually root for Michael (the murderous gangster brother) just as much as you root for Tommy.

Freddie Cork (Kevin Chapman) is the heart of the underworld on ""The Hill"" and employs Michael after he returns. It's Freddie and his unlawful band of henchmen, along with Michael Caffee and sidekick Pete, who twist facts, make shady deals and murder all in the name of money and power. Cork owns a local bar which serves as the central headquarters for all this 'business'; and it's Cork who provides a major thrust in the series, creating an apex of evil that's both charming and sinister.
But to discount the rest of the storylines and downplay the colorful cast of supporting characters would be a shame. Younger brother Tommy has his own battles to win as a junior member of the state senate representing the Hill. Though steeped in moral values and full of integrity, he doesn't always make the moral decision you'd expect and often looks like his brother when working the political machine to achieve personal gain. He is basically clueless when it comes to his family's needs. His beautiful wife is addicted to alcohol and drugs and his 13-year old daughter has struggles of her own.

Rounding out the show with complex storylines of their own are local state cops Declan and Ralph, the former a friend of the Caffee brothers since his youth. Actress Fionnula Flanagan plays the Caffee's mother, a tough-minded, hard working woman who would rather turn the other cheek to her son's downfalls.

There are too many storylines and characters to list here but it's great storytelling for fans of recent crime and drama genres that are displayed proudly on pay cable television, where there are no barriers on content and creative freedom is at its maximum. Brotherhood is a hard working, gritty crime drama worthy of joining the club. I can't wiat for Season Two.

The Italian mafia is its own thing, and Soprano pretty much started out on top. Here we get to watch the lead evil brother develope.

Can ANYONE please tell me the remark Tommy made to his sister about his Brother in law, while sitting on the doorstep outside to which she replied: Thats not nice!!
I replayed this segment more than 10 times, I cannot hear what he said, usually subtitles would solve this kind of enigma.

It is described as an Irish Sopranos,its usually not as out there as the Sopranos, although perhaps some violent scenes do thus remind. I guess Michael's execution of the 3 Russian mob thugs ( for which you find yourself cheering) or his clash with the Armenians, or the conversation between him and his partner about the dead FBI agent in the back of the Dodge Charger, do have some Sopranos in it.

I don't subscribe to Showtime, and I forgot about it (except on the occasions I read about it again).  Recently, I watched the Season One DVDs, and I will never forget about BROTHERHOOD again.  At first, I was interested because of the comparisons to THE SOPRANOS (I love THE SOPRANOS).  But this is not THE SOPRANOS.  And THE SOPRANOS is no BROTHERHOOD.  Other than having characters involved in organized crime, they are really nothing alike.  I understand why people compare the two.  They are both said to be about the blending of black and white, the shades of gray.  But THE SOPRANOS is more bombastic and a lot less ambiguous.  BROTHERHOOD is a cornucopia of gray.  The good guys in BROTHERHOOD are a lot less good, and the bad guys are even harder to dislike than the ones in THE SOPRANOS.  BROTHERHOOD's quality will give you hope in American-produced pop culture.  It's no surprise that it won a Peabody Award, one of the most prestigious awards that can be presented for achievement in electronic media.  If this series was broadcast on HBO, I think it would rival THE SOPRANOS for acclaim and awards.

If you're interested in a strictly black hat/white hat view of the world, BROTHERHOOD is not for you.

This series focuses round the Coffeys, who are an Irish American family, in an Irish American neighbourhood.  One brother is a politician, and the other brother is an evil tough guy criminal.  To cut a long story short, you will soon realise that that the politician brother, as well as who he liases with are more corrupted than his criminal brother, and the people he hang arounds with.

Well worth buying this series boxset, an absolute must have for Christmas.",1193097600,,693,4.75

Each episode makes me want to watch the next one right then.
Very exciting and very addictive!
Thank you.",1191369600,,262,4.717391304347826
2612688,5,B000GH3CWK,"We so enjoyed watching the first season over a weekend..
Some parts are excessively violent but that's what FF is for;-)

We loved it so much that it ALMOST made us sign up for Showtime, but for now, we'll just wait and buy the 2nd season from Amazon.

Fabulous acting, characters are hard to forget.",1191110400,2,300,4.4363636363636365
2612689,4,B000GH3CWK,"Maybe Brotherhood is Showtime's answer to The Sopranos, but to compare the two is unfair to both. Brotherhood's ambitions are more in line with The Departed, as both take a more serious approach to the focus on Irish New England mobsters and explore questions about the invisible line between crime and government. It's no coincidence that the real life of law-breaking legend Whitey Bulger provided the genesis for both.

While The Departed explores a fictionalized version of Bulger's relationship with law enforcement, Brotherhood semi-biographical tale focuses on a mobster and his wunderkind politician brother, mirroring the relationship Bulger had with his own brother who was the President of the Massachusetts State Senate.  Brotherhood's Caffees are shown to possess many of the same skills and standards, which allows them to rise to success in their different arenas.  While one uses his fists and weapons as a form of justice, the other wields a legislative pen and spending dollars to get people to bend to his wants.  Which one is the good brother?  Both...and neither.",1190678400,4,1084,5.242774566473988
2612690,5,B000GH3CWK,"Brotherhood is a show I caught by buying the DVD after reading some decent reviews online.  As a fan of anything gangster, most notably the Sopranos I started watching Brotherhood with high hopes.  After watching the first season I was surprised with how much Brotherhood stacked up to another HBO show, The Wire, as much as it can be compared to the boys from Jersey.  Brotherhood is as much as a show about Irish gangsters as it is a show about helping a down and out neighborhood survive the pitfalls of local and state politics.  If you are a fan of the Sopranos, The Wire, and everything New England check it out.",1188777600,3,618,4.491071428571429
2612691,5,B000GH3CWK,"Not only is the story of an Irish family (Caffee brothers) living in Providence, Rhode Island compelling, I love the fact that the scenes and names of the places are so authentic and real. I actually lived in the yellow house you see on the screen, on Carpenter Street, as a young boy. But, you don't have to be from Providence to like this story. The filming is well done. The actors are impressive to say the least. With shows like Dexter and now Brotherhood, Showtime is giving HBO a run for its money. Worth seeing.",1184716800,8,519,4.416666666666667

2612693,3,B000GH3CWK,"First of all, I want to say that I haven't watched the series yet. But what really surprised me it's the premise: two people helping each other from both sides of the law... It's exactly the same that ""Sanctuary"" a japanese manga (comic book) from author Ryoichi Ikegami (story by Sho Fumimura). It was a bestseller in Japan and some real action and anime films were made. It was about two friends that had shared a harsh infancy, and decide to gain control of the country's powers and then help each other: one will join the yakuza to become the national mob boss and the other will get into politics to became Japan's president. Shhiver!! I just wanted to point out these similarities. Does anybody know if this series is in fact based in ""Sanctuary""?",1175040000,2,753,4.5851851851851855

It was cool! Condidering Isaacs is from Liverpool, he pulled it off nicely.

It's also a great show!!! I can't wait for season2 .",1173225600,7,205,4.513513513513513

This shows me that American TV cares about really fine acting and writing.  I taped the show off the TV and wore out the tapes rerunning it for my own pleasure.  I am a Jason Isaacs nutter, love his abilities as a really great actor.  Also, this show is not just another of those New York specials like so many are, where folks think NY is the heart of American. Providence RI is a marvelous historic city with about a hundred times more worth than NY anytime.  I love it.",1167955200,6,578,4.171171171171171
2612697,2,B000GH3CWK,"I thought this mini series was poorly written and poorly acted.  The screenplay was not very good and the accents used by the characters to ""resemble"" Rhode Islanders were totally unrealistic and insulting.  As a Rhode Islander, the only things I liked in this mini series were the location shots of Providence.  I was able to recognize all of them.  I was an extra in the series and did see myself several times which was fun to see.",1167868800,5,434,4.5256410256410255
2612698,5,B000GH3CWK,"Brotherhood dramatically captures the sttruggle between good and evil inherent in all of us.  The brothers Caffee embody the everyday angst that may haunt most of us.  Michael, played by Jason Isaacs, the returned, dark brother tries mightly, despite his amoral criminal life, to be the ""good"" son, brother, uncle, etc.

Tommy, played by Jason Clarke, with his desire to serve his constituency, can not seem to repel the forces that beckon him to a darker side.

Eileen, brilliantly portrayed by Annabeth Gish, Tommy's wife, struggles with her own demons, while trying to be the ideal wife and mother.

Fionulla Flanagan, as the matriarch of the family, is reviting--powerful, sexy, and meancing, all at the same time.

Filmed in Providence, this series captures the working class neighborhoods of the U.S.  Its sights, sounds, and feelings are captured beautifully on film.

Blake Edwards has depicted this classic Ameerican struggle with a script that is both griltty and spell binding.

Brotherhood is a must see--must have.",1167868800,,1027,5.213414634146342
2612699,5,B000GH3CWK,this series is one of the best I've seen in a long time. Unlike the soprano's the acting on a scale of 1 to 10 is a 10!!!

8132161,2,B000GH3CWK,"Firstly, I'd like to specify I have only watched the first 4 episodes, because if you haven't heightened my interest at that point, sorry but it isn't happening later. I usually give a show 2 episodes, but gave this one 4 due to how much I like Jason Isaacs.

I'm not sure how else to say this, but Brotherhood is ""Sopranos Lite"" and I mean LITE. It isn't gripping or interesting enough and unfortunately, after getting a taste for the majority of the characters on repeat, they're just not very well-written. In fact, the cardinal sin in my opinion, is when a show tries really, really hard to write gritty, real characters, but fails. That is exactly what this show felt like - the characters are contrived and the writers are trying to cobble together several personalities of other mob figures or politicians condensed into one man or woman. It just isn't working.

Perhaps this show as a hit with people from the northeast, but I honestly think that's the only way I would be interested enough to watch it any further.",1490313600,,1023,4.615384615384615
