8357576,4,B002961O7Q,"Ths is a very good DVD set for those interested in making cowboy holsters, however, as a long time leatherworker I did have some issues with it. Some areas are over explained, stitching is fairly straightforward and didn't need nearly 40 minutes devoted to it. Yet other steps, such as how to guage pattern sizing, are left essoteric as Chuck simply eyeballed the patterns for fit and used his experience to gauge how much larger than the guns the patterns needed to be and gave no explanation of how to do this.
Price wise this set is okay, $45 for a two DVD set is acceptable, however, it would have been nice to have some standard features such as closed captioning, as in some areas Chuck continues to talk when using the mallet which overloads the microphone making it difficult to understand him at times.
All in all this set is the best of its type and well worth the price, though a five minute addition on sizing and the inclusion of closed captioning would make it a must have.",1436918400,,987,4.488888888888889
8357577,5,B002961O7Q,This video set leaves no questions unanswered. One of the best how to videos I have ever seen. I feel as though I am prepared to tackle the project after watching it just once. I will be getting other videos by Chuck in the future.,1361750400,,231,4.155555555555556
8357578,5,B002961O7Q,"Chuck is a master at his craft and goes through every step of creating two gorgeous western holsters. First a Mexican loop, then a Slim Jim. Really takes the mystery out of what should really be considered artwork. From creating patterns, cutting out the leather, stamping, carving, punching the holes, stitching, dyeing, finishing, installing silver spots, material selection, prepping, tools and techniques. The video covers it all. A must-have if you're interested in getting into making gunleather. Now I need his video on knife sheaths and wish he had one on beadwork. See the rest of his work on the Wild Rose Trading Company website.",1326931200,3,640,5.104761904761904
