3444316,4,B0019X3YXM,"Would you be attracted to a seemingly bi-polar, erratic and extremely domineering young woman (Jordan) you met on a subway just as she was passing out in a drunken stupor? Well you might if she looked like Elisha Cuthbert. That's just what happened for conservative and highly motivated Charlie (Jesse Bradford) and from that moment on he would forever divide his life between the time before he met her and the time after.

The '07 American remake of the Korean film of the same name, `My Sassy Girl' is an entertaining though inebriated love story that I like to refer to as `Serendipity' with alcohol.  For the majority of the film the viewer will most likely find themselves in a state of confusion, yet fully intrigued and engaged in to film. You will wonder more than once exactly where the storyline is heading, so much so that the fate of the film depended on a really good ending to weave all the disparate, unanswered aspects of the tale into an acceptable conclusion. Fortunately, the ending does exactly that providing the audience with not only understanding but a bit of unexpected depth. Well worth the time and effort I would say.",1222819200,,1146,4.725

I didn't know I would want to see it again as soon as it ended, because i did, I really enjoyed this movie and it just kept me smiling and
laughing and very entertaining with interesting music that fit it
wonderfully.

3444318,5,B0019X3YXM,"I've read review after review comparing it to the original, well, I haven't seen the original, so those reviews mean nothing to me.

What I can say is that we almost turned the movie off, finding it quirky and weird, not seeming to make sense in the beginning.

By the end we were touched, the characters and the story brought us to tears!  I am going back to watch it again...and believe me...I don't do that with many romantic comedies.

Well acted, well done.  Pick it up, watch it and love it!",1220832000,2,497,4.358695652173913
3444319,5,B0019X3YXM,"Having never seen the Korean version of this film, I can't tell anyone if it follows the same concept or plot.
But, I don't think you have to see the Korea version to enjoy this film.  It's touching, a little off beat,and leaves the viewer with a ""warm and fuzzy"" feeling.
I bought this DVD as on impulse and I was very glad that I did. The atmosphere of the film is beautiful, the dialogue is fluid, and the actors do a good job portraying the characters they were given.
The entire movie is portrayed as a fairy tale, and I think that at heart, that is what it is...a nice light hearted film that makes you feel happy after you watch it.",1220832000,2,639,4.195121951219512

Elisha Cuthbert is wonderful in this, the star of the movie. I was never a huge fan of hers until watching her in this, she shines. The story is powerful and well acted. I thought that this movie had a bit of everything... can make you laugh, make you sad and make you happy. I would definitely recommend seeing it.

3444322,5,B0019X3YXM,"Witty, entertaining, and clever--I loved this film. I thought the art direction and overall editting was top notch, and the story was wonderful.
It was devoid of stupid humor, which seems to be all the rage nowadays. That doesn't mean it wasn't funny, though!
Some moments of the movie brought tears to my eyes, and some moments had me laughing. All the moments in between weren't in the slightest way boring, either. I'm real picky about movies, especially those considered to be romantic comedy. This one is very well done.
I'll be watching the original version tonight, and I'll see how they both compare. Till then though, this has got to be one of my favorite films of the summer--right there with Penelope and Charlie Bartlett.",1220140800,4,733,4.825396825396825
3444323,5,B0019X3YXM,"This movie was excellent, very charming and entertaining with great acting and directing.

Elisha Cuthbert is PHENOMENAL in this!!!!  If you are already a fan of hers then this should be a definite dvd purchase for you.  This role is perfect for her and she plays it brilliantly.  She's hilarious and very likeable in this and her antics are incredibly amusing.  Easily, one of my favorite movie characters ever.

The guy in this was very good and had chemistry with Cuthbert which was important to this movie working.

Writing and directing, top notch.  This movie never had a dull moment.  I was constantly engaged and entertained, and there were a ton of laughs, mostly provided by Elisha Cuthbert.  This movie had an awesome visual style, very pleasing to look at, with some particularly impressive shots throughout.

This is the kind of movie that I will be able to watch over and over again, so a dvd purchase is a must in my case.  I really hope this movie catches on and more people give it a shot, because it's definitely one of my favorite films.",1219708800,5,1056,4.648648648648648
3444324,1,B0019X3YXM,"Maverick/Vertigo originally got high marks for deciding to remake a very popular Korean film of the same name, but the results were less than fantastic. The targeted audience of teen to twenty-somethings was obvious with two castings of the Bring It On actor Jesse Bradford and the popular 24 daughter Elisha Cuthbert.

The requests for this one were already pouring in because of the original piece, plus the director from the highly rated Love Me if You Dare made his next film. I'll skip the comparisons between the two films and just try this one on its own merit.

The storyline of two young strangers meeting in New York and falling in love appears quite forcefully after a novice storyboard coverage of the main character's early life. Our Cuthbert character plays the strange and mysterious rich girl with a damaged back story we know nothing about. Through the course of their strange meetings, dates or whatever you want to call them, all of the teens watching left the room within 20 minutes. I stuck it out to see if this dysfunctional relationship would become believable. It never really does, and as the love story grew painfully more boring and contrived, the middle-aged ladies gave up watching also.

The ending had some heart, but overall the film never materializes into anything enjoyable, believable or rewatchable. The DVD has absolutely nothing extra to it, so between there being no special features whatsoever and a disappointing love story, I had to give it the lower rating.",1219536000,13,1502,4.928853754940712

I actually enjoyed even more it the second and third time even more because I knew the back story that isn't revealed until the end--the first time was still good.

3444338,5,B0019X3YXM,"Don't you hate it when true love kicks you in the head? Easily Elisha Cuthbert's best movie to date, My Sassy Girl is an offbeat romantic comedy that veers far away from the formulaic rom-com norm and lands squarely on the notion that love, can indeed, hurt. Gripping for the genre, I was constantly torn between rooting for and against each character. More like watching a hockey game with no ref's than your typical romantic comedy. With an ending I didn't see coming and a third act twist that actually makes cry every time I watch it, My Sassy Girl is a shockingly captivating film.

3444346,1,B0019X3YXM,"My Sassy Girl is a remake of the Korean film of the same title. Unfortunately,it was a very poor remake and it completely missed the mark of what the original version was all about despite the fact that it follows the same events of the Gianna Jun starrer. The characters in it were definitely cartoon-like that nobody will empathize with. It was also more of a slapstick comedy rather than a love story. Most of all,it does not bother about the mystery of love but it follows the conventional romcom genre-type of boy meets girl movie. In the end,it made both the main characters - Charlie and Jordan - extremely painful to watch and to cheer for as they were like adults acting idiotically from one turn to another. Skip this one and watch the original Korean film to fully appreciate what this was suppose to be all about. No wonder it wasn't released in movie theaters.",1405382400,,873,4.56687898089172

It is the innocence of the Korean culture.  I'm not sure I would have liked it as much if I actually spoke Korean.  I am attempting to lean it to find out.  The translation in subtitles is really good.  Ms. Jun is my favorite actress in any genre.  This one and My love from a star give me an emotion roller coaster ride.  From tears to laughter out loud.

The guy was brain dead.  The girl did not respect anyone.
Destroying someone's job interview, is like murdering his future.  That is NOT the girl I want to spend rest of my life with.

You are better off buying the movie and watch it on a standard DVD player or just rent the SD version.

I never had a problem with HULU, netflix or FIOS. I am writing this review as a warning to people who want to stream this movie on amazon HD.",1399334400,,474,4.096774193548387
3444352,5,B0019X3YXM,"Movies, like theatre, have two major categories, comedy and drama but sometimes, like this movie, they are beautifully intertwined. This movie is one of those movies. For the first hour of the movie, I find myself laughing at all the right places, the ones where they wanted me  to laugh and where you want to laugh. I enjoy getting to know them and watch their relationship develop. The whole time you know something's off, but you still love watching them together. Then the tears come. The backstory is finally told and you finally understand everything so far. It's beautiful and it's heartbreaking. And I cry. The ending is just wonderful. So appropriate to the movie.

The movie feels like real life in all the right ways. Life is not just comedy and it's not just drama. Life is a beautiful mix of the two. There's no telling when the funny parts will be or the serious parts, you just know they come. For me, this make the movie even better. Do you have to suspend disbelief for this movie? A bit. Most guys probably just wouldn't have the patience for a girl like Jordan, and most girls probably wouldn't react and act like Jordan in a similar situation. But that's ok for me. I watch a movie to experience something other than real life. I live a life, sometimes I want a silly girl, the guy that puts up with her, and the love story that they live. This movie is real enough to suspend disbelief where necessary. And it's worth it to allow that to happen. This story is beautiful and worth a watch.

My final recommendation for this movie, the point to really take home. I saw this movie on DVD in 2008 or 2009. And, because of series of events, didn't see it again until 2014. This is one of those rare movies that I couldn't forget. It didn't get mixed up with something else. It's unique, and one of my favorite movies. I have seen more movies than I can fathom, some of them I can't remember what they were about (i.e.: The Big Wedding...can't remember it for ANYTHING) this movie, followed me until I finally bought it so I can watch it anytime. I think that's the biggest recommendation I can make for it!

Finally, this movie has a real independent film feel. When you watch it, you know it's not a mainstream movie, but it offers something that most independent films don't, a happy ending, and I love that about this film. Seriously, just buy it and watch it. It's worth it.",1395100800,,2394,4.458904109589041

3444359,1,B0019X3YXM,"I decided to watch this movie because it is a remake of a cute and touching Korean romantic comedy that I really enjoyed watching. The remake was a major disappointment, it captured nothing of the complexity of the characters in the Korean original and failed to depict any chemistry between the two main characters. The sassy girl in the Korean version is a complex character, who despite being absolutely sassy and at times mean is at the same time lovely, adorable and vulnerable. Elisha Cuthbert, however, does not bring any of this complexity to the role, the character she depicts is not much more than simply annoying. A full review would give too much away of the plot for people who have not seen the movie, but in short it is safe to say that this remake falls flat, and that it is recommended to watch the Korean original instead.",1380412800,3,841,4.613333333333333

Ehh, it's just one of the things I do, I guess. There's actually an Indian remake also, and a Chinese sequel - the Korean film was a huge success across Asia - but if they're no better than this, I won't be making an effort to track them down (well, not MUCH effort).  Still, I'd have to guess that the mixture of melodrama and broad comedy that the original film captures so brilliantly is not as foreign to other Asian filmmakers as it obviously was to American director Yann Samuel and screenwriter Victor Levin.

Canadian actress Elisha Cuthbert plays the ""sassy"" (read: obnoxious, rude, nearly psychopathic in this film) girl, given a name in this version (""Jordan""), and Jesse Bradford plays her hapless savior/suitor Charlie. It's pretty much a scene-for-scene remake of the original, but transplanted entirely to Manhattan and cut by about 40 minutes, which removes any possibility of the subtleties of the Korean film, particularly in class and gender issues; here we get a much more simplistic contrast between uber-rich girl and struggling from-the-sticks guy.  The fantasy sequences here just seem like throwaways, because Jordan just isn't as well developed as Gianna Jun's character was in the earlier film, and because there is little that is endearing about her until near the end.  The Korean film's lengthy run-time (in the extended version) and use of a wider variety of locations helps give it an almost ""epic"" feel (if a romcom can be epic) and really does help to make the central relationship at least borderline believable. Here we're just racing towards an ending that feels nearly as cliched as the idiotic intro with our intrepic hero's flyover-country parents (the one signficant change from the original, and a poor one).

It's not entirely worthless; some of the virtues in the sentimental ending of the first film seem to work against all odds in this gutless remake, and Cuthbert and Bradford are a very, very attractive couple.  But overall...blech.  There are loads of reasons why I'm so attracted to Korean romances, and why most American examples these days are just horrendous, and nearly all of them could be found just by watching these two Sassy Girls.",1379980800,,2554,5.304455445544554

Wow, where to start on this remake?  First of all, I am a huge fan of the original Korean movie; if you have not seen it, please stop reading now and go do so; I can almost guarantee that if you like chick flicks, a la ""The Notebook"", that you will like the Korean version, and perhaps even love it, like I did.  So what's wrong with this remake?  CAUTION - SPOILERS AHEAD

Within the first five minutes of the movie, it had already gone off the rails.  Maybe it never even got on the rails.  The opening music was a variation, a worse variation, on the opening music to the original movie.  So I didn't like the music, big deal.  But the huge, waving red flag was how the subject of the cousin's death was introduced.  The male lead is positively flippant about his cousin having just died.  It was like the movie wanted to play the cousin's death for a laugh or something.  This was most likely the fault of the writer, but it's hard not to blame the actor and director too.

I actually like the two lead actors, but Elisha Cuthbert was seriously miscast in this movie.  She's not old, but she's too worldly to pull off the irrational behavior required by the script.  In the Korean original, the actress was innocent and almost tomboyish; she didn't have any ""feminine wiles""; she's just innocent, sweet, and suffering.  The audience forgives her behavior because she is so innocent and sweet, and you see her heartbreak in almost every frame.  The problem is, Cuthbert's character seems like she ought to know better, and she exudes a sexiness and lack of innocence that is wrong for the character.  It made me wonder if the character might be a part-time dominatrix or something.

Next, the editing: was the editor asleep?  There is a whole scene missing:  the male lead takes the girl to his apartment, there's a cut, and now he's walking out of jail.  At least I think he's walking out of jail.  What the hell just happened?  This is very near the beginning of the movie, and yet another big red flag of things to come.

Now I come to the most egregious of the factors that ruined this remake: the writing.  I'm not a vindictive man, but I hope the writer or writers suffer a nasty papercut.  Is that too harsh?  OK, maybe so, but every change the writer made from the original movie made this movie worse.  Why did they have to change the nature of the male lead's character?  In the original movie, he's kind of a dog and hits on girls pretty outrageously when he's drunk; it's very amusing.  In the remake, he's more of a 40 Year Old Virgin type, who wants to work for a tractor company.  A tractor company?  I was surprised they didn't have all the characters wear cowboy hats to demonstrate to the audience that this was an American movie (made by Koreans).  Also, almost every scene seems rushed; maybe the writer and director thought Americans didn't have the attention span required for longer scenes, but it's like the movie is playing at slightly-faster-than-normal speed, throughout the entire movie.  The pacing is rushed; the dialogue is rushed.

Do you like the scene where the male lead hits on the female lead in the street, not realizing it's her?  Yep, it's gone.

Remember the recreations of the action movies that the girl writes?  Well, they worsened those.  They filmed them as if they were scenes from a high school play; maybe they were running out of money.

The racquetball scene?  In the original, the male lead gets hit with the ball about a million times and it's hilarious.  Yep, they removed that.

The one scene I would have changed from the original movie was the amusement park scene with the soldier.  This scene doesn't fit the tone of the rest of the movie very well, so I thought they might cut it or alter it in some way.  Of course, the writer decided to reproduce this scene somewhat faithfully, and it doesn't work this time either.  At least they rushed through it, just like every other scene.

And now, some of my favorite lines from the original and, you guessed it, they are missing in the remake:
1 - ""Hey, wanna die?"" (every one is removed)
2 - ""If she hits you, act like it hurts.  If it hurts, act like it doesn't.""
3 - ""I don't have to go now.""

I now understand why this remake went straight to video.  The original was funny and heart-breaking; the remake is heart-breaking but for mostly the wrong reasons.  After watching it, I had to immediately re-watch the original to wipe this film off my eyes.  It gets 2.5 stars because it's based on a movie that is so good, and some of it survives, but not nearly enough, so I'm rounding down.  Alas, for what should have been.

Oh, one more thing:  I must give props to the remake for removing the graphic throwing-up scenes from the original.  Probably it would have been better to just edit them down, but I think they were all removed.  To me, these scenes in the original are a little too gross, and I've gotten into the habit of fast-forwarding through them.",1327363200,,4996,4.470653377630121

From the very beginning of the movie, my jaw hit the floor. I think in the past I may have found Elisha Cuthbert's character compelling, ""free-spirited"" and attractive, but now... She is a by-the-book, larger than life, larger than psychology textbook hardcore narcissist; she disrupts poor guy's life in every possible way, has him arrested, harassed, concussed, humiliated, estranged from what matters to him. She constantly disrupts his life, his schedule, whatever he wants, or builds, or wishes for, she has to come first, she is grossly irresponsible, immature, ""cute"", ""dangerous"". She introduces him without warning to a new love interest, she plays hot when he can't take it anymore, she pouts, she faints, she sues him, takes him to Daddy so Daddy can make him feel 2 inches tall and show NO RESPECT whatsoever for any part of him.
Of course, some ""reason"" is found by the the end of the movie. Whatever.
Funnily enough, I watched Chasing Amy a day after watching My Sassy Girl, and CA's characters's reality, sensitivity, honesty and sometimes great maturity were an eerie clash to MSG's.

I am in the process of learning that real life isn't what's portrayed in the movies. And MSG could do a lot of damage, if believed...",1264809600,,1660,4.869257950530035
3444376,5,B0019X3YXM,"First off, let me say that I've not seen the Korean version, so I'm not going to make any comparison. I was living in Vietnam when the original movie came out (some time in 2002), and it was a mega-mega hit there. So, it's understandable if some people are not satisfied with the remake.

That out of the way, I have to say that this is an excellent movie. I don't see this one so much like a ""drama marketing as a comedy"". It is sort of a funny romantic movie. I think the director did a good job of keeping the spirit of the original movie. I'm not Korean, but a Vietnamese. I understand the Asian mindset. I don't know how different the two are, but the story in general is very very Asian, at least in my opinion. I'd not go too much on the romantic side and focus on the funny side.

The ""romantic"" comedy was great! I'll explain it. I don't like movies are too predictable. This one is definitely not. The movie kept me on edge during the  ""1 year after"" sequence at the tree. When I saw they bury letters under the tree and decide to meet 1 year later, I thought of it as a classic tragedy in romantic movie. You know, like one character will be there, reads the letter and finds one his loved one had some terrible illness (most often some kind of cancer). All that character can do is to sit there with nostalgia because his lover is already dead.

Well, they got me there. I don't want to spoil the movie, so go ahead and watch it. I came from crying (they were such a great couple) to laughing out really loud.

Anyway, enjoy the movie! I also recommend you to watch it the second time to pick up the nuances you probably overlook the first time you see it. The ending connects all those clues.

Oh, one more thing. Elisha Cuthbert is gorgeous! To be honest, I decided to watch this movie because of her name. I can't keep my eyes off her. I'm not surprise Charlie felt in love with her at first sight. She is simply gorgeous!",1260230400,,1937,4.193548387096774
3444377,3,B0019X3YXM,"I've seen the original twice.  As a native Korean, I loved the original movie.  It's a laugh-out-loud movie but also a heart-warming romantic comedy, excellently done by the two main actors.  A definite keeper.

I was very curious to find out that they've done an American remake of the film.  As the original movie had a very distinct Korean culture, I was excited to see how they've turned it into an American film.  I expected to see much change in the plot but surprisingly there were many familiar scenes.  The scene on the subway and the games that the girl plays were all in the American version.  Even the rose scene which was a significant part in the original movie was kept in tact.  Unlike other reviewers, I was actually disappointed that they kept so many of the original movie.  I'm grateful that the film makers showed respect to the original movie but they forget that the original movie was geared towards a Korean audience which is why the craziness of a cute girl works.  In many Korean films, it is quite common to see a girl's charm manifested in her obnoxious behaviour and such.  But I wasn't convinced of it in the American version.  The girl just was really annoying and I was annoyed with the guy for taking such crap from a crazy girl.

I think the movie should've been more Americanized.  It has a such a sweet story to it but the film makers' over sensitivity to the original movie was, in my opinion, a hindrance to recreating this film.  Lakehouse is another movie that was adapted from a very well known Korean film.  They kept the spirit of the original but changed quite a lot of the plot and even changed the characters a little bit, to suit an American audience and look how well that turned out.

When a film is being remade, although there should be some homage to the original, the remade movie should still be able to stand on its own.  As for this film, if I hadn't seen the original movie, I would've given this film less than three stars.",1259971200,17,1982,4.47075208913649

None of this looks like much fun (and Charlie frequently tells his college roommate how un-fun it is).  But Charlie can't help himself, 'cause, gosh-darn it, he's fallen in love.

What's the ""painful secret"" that has turned Jordan into such a hellion?  It's not hard to guess.  And it hardly justifies her stupid behavior, or Charlie's patience with her.  By the time the ""painful secret"" is finally revealed, there's just time for some painful dialogue about ""destiny"" and a painful wrap-up that only underscores how stupid Jordan was to keep her secret for so long.

3444383,2,B0019X3YXM,"The 2008 ""My Sassy Girl"" is, as you know, a remake of the Korean film of the same title made in 2001. But the remake went straight to DVD in USA, which suggests something is wrong with the film, but you know, Danny Boyle's Oscar-winning ""Slumdog Millionaire"" was almost released straight to DVD instead of getting a theatrical release in America, so you just cannot judge the film by that alone. In the case of ""My Sassy Girl,"" however, my instincts proved right.

In ""My Sassy Girl"" Elisha Cuthbert (best known as Kim Bauer in ""24"") plays the titular girl, slightly eccentric and unpredictable Jordan Roark. When good-natured, mild-mannered Charlie Bellow from Midwest (played by Jesse Bradford, ""Bring it on"") meets her on the subway platform in New York City, the girl is terribly drunk and she falls asleep on the bench. As Charlie is a kind guy, he couldn't leave her alone so he carries her (literally) to his room.

This is probably a highly unusual (and unlikely) way of getting to know someone else, but the film goes on anyway. Knowing that life with this strange girl is big trouble, Charlie continues to meet Jordan, who keeps cropping up unexpectedly, and virtually sabotages his career. I don't know why, but he thinks she is still attractive and irresistible, so Charlie starts seeing her and falls in love with her.

What is refreshing and intriguing in a certain situation doesn't necessarily look the same in another. Ji-hyun Jun's ""sassy girl"" in the original, so full of emotion, interested us because of the cultural background of the heroine and the hero and their reversed power relations between the sexes. Elisha Cuthbert's ""sassy girl"" on the other hand is only implausible and annoying. Her character lacks the soul that the original's sassy girl surely had.

Or maybe someone else should be blamed. Yann Samuell, known for his unique and dark romance ""Love Me If You Dare"" (starring Marion Cotillard), is clearly not the best choice for director of this film, of which story includes very melodramatic elements. You need confidence in telling this kind of emotional love story, but judging from his previous effort which looks like darker ""Amelie,"" Yann Samuell's strength lies somewhere else.

There are many romantic comedies set in New York City - ""Annie Hall"" ""When Harry Met Sally..."" and the list goes on - and like them the city itself plays a significant role in ""My Sassy Girl"" which is visually alluring. Sadly its soulless narrative lacks the charms and beauty of the photography.",1244246400,3,2519,4.889929742388759
3444384,1,B0019X3YXM,"This film is billed as a romantic comedy, but it is neither romantic nor funny. It is the story of a ""nice,"" but bored, college boy who falls in love with a destructive girl. We learn at the end that Jordan's destructive behavior is due to a ""painful secret,"" but the most painful part of this film is the film itself. Jordan's (Elisha Cuthbert's) ""hotness"" doesn't make up for this lousy movie.

There are no likable characters, and none of the characters make any sense. Ostensibly, Charlie's reason for falling in love with Jordan is that his parents are so nice and conventional that he craves people who are the opposite. For her part, Jordan has her own sick reasons for liking Charlie, and all the maudlin sappiness at the end doesn't redeem this story; if anything, it makes it worse. I can't tell you what Jordan's painful secret is without spoiling the movie (as if I could spoil it!), but I can tell you that her pain doesn't explain her behavior. By the middle of this film I felt convinced that Charlie loved Jordan not in spite of her destructive behavior but because of it, and there's nothing romantic or funny about that! Maybe Charlie also has a ""painful secret"" that could explain away his actions? I'll look for that in the sequel.

In the end, I was left wondering why Charlie felt so strongly attracted to an incredibly rude, destructive, selfish, irrational alcoholic who, even after she has pulled herself together, is still completely irrational with silly talk about ""destiny.""

Why does Hollywood feel the need to take classic non-American films and rape them until they're deformed beyond all recognition? It must be nice to make millions of dollars by doing nothing more than crapping on various works of art from other countries. I'm apparently in the wrong line of business.

First off, Jesse Bradford sounds like a weasel and gives a mediocre performance. Just watch his reaction after Elisha Cuthbert lies to his teacher - it's terrible. Cuthbert is your typical Hollywood actress under 30 years of age - very hot, but couldn't act her way out of a paper bag. Watching her try to be ""sassy"" is incredibly painful because at times her mannerisms are overly accentuated to the point where she looks like she's got a bad case of hemorrhoids. As far as supporting actors go, the guy who played the runaway soldier was dreadful, and the old man near the end was even worse. Ji-hyun Jun's performance in the original was no fluke. South Korea has at least 5 times as much youthful acting talent than the States. That's no exaggeration.

This is your typical Hollywood remake that reenacts a dozen or so scenes from the superior original in unimaginative, idiotic ways (ala ""The Departed"") in an effort to pander to the dim-wittedness and xenophobia of your typical American moviegoer who would rather slit their wrists than read subtitles. This is evident in the dialogue, which is way too cringeworthy for its own good. Every single line is opaque, thoughtless, and overly simplified to the point of sheer stupidity. Here are some direct quotes from the film:

1. ""Death, man...death sucks!"" 2. ""I like you and the last three days have been some of the most interesting (if not painful) of my life. But my brain is hemorrhaging and my career is ruined and I just think it's better if we part ways."" 3. ""Who would be intrigued by a hot, mysterious, passionate, possibly bipolar, violent, drunken, arrogant, rude woman?"" 4. ""Whatever she was going through - it was beyond anything in my experience and beyond my ability to fix. I had no right to judge her. If I chose to stay with her (knowing the risks) all I could do was give her love and respect and see how the story would end."" 5. ""I'm sorry. He's just a guy my father made me go out with, but every second I was with him I was wishing it was you and that's why I called you tonight - I couldn't take it anymore. Charlie, I need you."" 6. ""Hey kid, is this a subway platform or your own piece of drawing paper?"" 7. ""You know what? I know that you really don't want to hurt me."" 8. ""Yessss, I'm free and I'm loving it. Train where are you. Wooo hooo. Choo choo.""

Hollywood translation: ""We resent your lack of intelligence, so we are apparently forced to lower the quality of this film by providing superfluous exposition on the part of the characters for the sole purpose of explaining every little thing to you. You are incapable of extracting emotional content from subtle mannerisms, symbolism, or even the slightest bit of indirect communication. Yes, you are a moron, but if we talentless hacks want to make money, we simply need the characters to verbally and plainly explain every little emotion, lest you become completely lost.""

Am I the only one who realizes just how much Hollywood hates its own fans? At least 90% of their films are devoid of any and all subtlety. This is even worse in the case of remakes, because they must knowingly suck every ounce of intelligence out of the original film. Wake up people. You can cut the patronization with a knife. These movies scream, ""You are an imbecile!"" And yes, supporting them does make you an imbecile.

Oh, but that's not all. If the insipid, moron-proof dialogue weren't bad enough, this movie drops one of the most idiotic psychological twists humanly imaginable. Our two lovebirds decide to take exactly one year off so Cuthbert can heal her wounds, but she shows up 24 hours late because she needed one more arbitrary day for healing. That's beyond ridiculous. Only a Hollywood executive could think of something this mind-numbingly stupid.

The only halfway decent moments in this movie use concepts from the original. There's not a shred of well-executed originality to be found in this steaming pile of excrement. The only positives I can think of are a few pretty camerashots. Hence the 2/10 rating. The only comfort I have is that this vile garbage went direct to DVD. A small victory in the neverending battle against the cinematic dark ages that we Americans currently reside in. Cultural naivety, ignorance, repetition, and incredibly low standards seem to be the favored cinematic ideals around here as of late. However, I must say that the original Korean film is still nowhere to be found at your local video store. One might expect a simultaneous DVD release along with the remake. Such is unfortunately not the case.

People wonder why I generally hate Hollywood cinema as much as I do, but I ask you - my dear reader - how can I not? I don't like to be patronized by a bunch of talentless hacks in corporate suits who insult my intelligence by making a movie like this and actually expecting me to like it. Maybe I'm missing something, because everyone else around me finds comfort in this masochistic, self-hating existence. My fellow Americans may be flamboyant cowboys in terms of foreign policy, but in terms of entertainment they are the equivalent of abused housewives who keep coming back for more. Whether its ignorance or sheer stupidity, they just don't know any better.

May Hollywood burn in hell for all eternity. God knows they deserve it.",1233792000,8,5628,4.71617497456765

I watched this movie like 4 or 5 times on a cruise to the Carribean last week... and I loved it... and I'm a guy.

Its a great vehicle for Cuthbert, allowing her to act and not be just another pretty Maxim magazine pinup.  She dominates the screen... and the male lead is subdued enough to allow her to intoxicate his world with what at first appears to be her Free Spirit wild-child ways.

Those that can't stand her Bi-polar-ish actions ...need to hang in there, ALL will be revealed.  The character of Jordan Roark is much deeper than that of spoiled little rich girl.

There are not one...but TWO payoffs at the end for those that do stick with it, Jordan's story...and one really great kiss.  After you learn Jordan's story... you'll want to go back and watch the movie again and pick up all the little nuances of the movie that make a second watching much more enjoyable.

3444389,5,B0019X3YXM,"Elisha Cuthbert stars as Jordan Roark and Jesse Bradford as Charlie Bellows, two apparently mismatched New Yorkers who randomly meet on a subway platform.

The packaging and parts of the movie stylistically say ""romantic comedy."" And there are funny parts, but not based on the now common gross gags or sexual double entendre. But the humor is not the core of the movie. Charlie Bellows is a typical romantic comedy straight man, so it's easy to see where viewers might be misled. Jordan Roark is not the typical inhabitant of a romantic comedy. In fact she's the mystery. What makes her so volatile and emotionally dangerous but compelling?

The movie was deeper than I expected with a real reward at the end. I couldn't take my eyes off of Elisha Cuthbert. The story builds somewhat slowly but the nuance is there in Elisha's characterization to explain everything in retrospect. I found her compelling. There was no mystery why Jesse's Charlie Bellows fell in love, despite the Elisha's manic behavior as Jordan.

It wasn't the romantic comedy I expected, but it was a rewarding, surprising and oddly compelling drama by the end. I've rewatched it several times and found additional subtlety, emotion and meaning each time. My Sassy Girl was much better than anticipated, and perhaps expectations play a role.

Those viewers that saw the original Korean version have vastly different expectations and apparently wanted the same movie in English, and didn't get it. Those that want and need a light romantic comedy would also be disappointed. If you're willing to ride along and let the movie develop on its own merits, there's more meaning and drama than meets the eye in the first half of the film.

The acting and production is not as good as the original, but they do follow the storyline very closely to the original. Anyway I really enjoyed this movie, and I think anyone who likes romantic comedies would enjoy this movie too.",1454371200,,330,4.5

Cuthbert plays a classic Manic Pixie Dream Girl and takes the audience on a wild ride where the viewer can't help but fall in love with her character as well. Fun, flighty, and a fast movie.
