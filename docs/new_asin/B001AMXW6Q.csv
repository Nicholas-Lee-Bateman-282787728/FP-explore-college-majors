8278071,3,B001AMXW6Q,"The video quality on this series of DVD's isn't that good, but the material presented is great.  I'm a certified interpreter and the idioms presented in this series are in common use, and valuable to know as an interpreter.  I would certainly recommend that students use this product.  Also, the presenters are pretty funny, you can tell they have fun doing the DVD's.",1221868800,,368,4.809523809523809
8278072,5,B001AMXW6Q,"As a student, it's really frustrating to be limited in my ASL communication.  I don't have that kind of patience.  So, deaf idioms really do help expand my vocabulary and build my cofidence when communicating with other deaf people.  To be fluent in ASL, it is important to understand these idioms.  They are really used quite often.  Now that I am learning these idioms, I have recognized alot of them so far used by deaf individuals and interpreters too.  I'm really excited, because it gives me an advantage in that my limited communication is increasing rapidly.  I have even noticed my instructors doing some of these signs.",1220745600,4,629,4.822429906542056
