First thing I would do upon getting back to camp would be making sure my zero was on. After letting that sheep go they go after other Rams, that's entirely on the outfitter (should have gone after it or filled his tag). Second going after the the first bear missing twice within bow range is just unacceptable. Second hunt guy shoots at a ram 5 times hitting it with 4 rounds once in the horn! Please spend the time at the range and know your rifle before hunting! Wasn't with the $20 nor my time! I do have to say the 3rd Hunt was far better good shot. Glad that at the end the 1st hunter killed the original ram he wounded but only by sheer luck.",1432857600,,768,4.059210526315789
8202463,3,8450169682,"Starting off, the first guy wounds a sheep after literally a dozen shots, then makes no effort to pursue it...then goes after another....gives us hunters a really bad name. The videography and commentary are good, not impressed with the outfitter",1420761600,,246,5.175

8202465,5,8450169682,"Now, the best kept secret in Alaskan trophy sheep hunting is revealed by Spencer McCuin in this hunting video, Deep in Sheep.  Spencer spends a month with Tom Shankster and Alaska Trophy Hunts, following three different hunters on real Dall sheep hunts, as they are guided by the best guides Alaska has to offer.  Deep in Sheep captures the difficulty of real sheep hunting, as well as the reward.  You will walk through some of the most rugged terrain to catch a glimpse of these elusive animals, and you will enjoy some of the most beautiful scenery Alaska has to offer.  As a hunter who has been there, I can only say ""Thank you"" Spencer for the incredible videography, and I hope to see more from you in the future.",1354752000,2,719,4.507692307692308
