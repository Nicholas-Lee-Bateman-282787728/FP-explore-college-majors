8142292,4,B000HXDWOQ,"I really ""liked"" this film. When I say liked I mean it seemed to be a fairly accurate portrayal of domestic violence, and I think it was very well acted. It also made an effort to see all sides, delving into the psychology of the different characters and what in their lives might have influenced them, bringing them to their current behaviors.

In the beginning of the film Pilar (Laia Marull) leaves her husband with her young son in tow one night in a rush, with barely any possessions and ends up at her sister Ana's apartment. Ana, who lives with her fiance, takes Pilar and her son in, and is very kind and supportive. She maintains a whatever you need I am here for you attitude throughout the movie. She even lines her up for a job interview at an art museum, so it seems sort of an odd footnote to me that Pilar ends up verbally attacking her later in the movie. I was also bewildered with how easily she got this job, with no reticence on the part of the interviewer, even though she had barely any work experience. The rest of the film seems very realistic, so these details and sketchiness of the two sisters relationship, and the somewhat undefined personality of Ana, is the only reason I am giving it four stars and not five.

Luis Tosar as Pilar's husband Antonio has a violent temper but is not completely unsympathetic and undertakes therapy during the movie. It's obvious he really loves his wife. Yes, the Spanish culture he lives in is very macho, and that accounts for some of his attitudes, but we also come to understand violent outbursts are the result of Antonio's insecurity and self-loathing. There is something in his family's dynamics which make him feel unappreciated and short-changed, and we are not exactly sure what else. We do learn he feels unworthy working as an appliance salesman in the family business, at what he feels is a low wage.

Antonio also has a poetic side and when asked by his therapist what he misses about Pilar after she leaves him, he says he misses ""her sound."" When prodded he says she walks swiftly and barely makes any sound. There are other examples of the poetic side of this man during his and Pilar's love scenes, that seem more ominous, like when he says he wishes to possess all of her, from her thighs all the way up to the top of her head. He encourages her to slowly give him her various parts as they make love. It was very uncomfortable and gross watching that particular scene in the movie and it lends a sense of foreshadowing for what is to come later.

I think the ending is very good. We root for all the characters in the film to overcome and resolve their problems, especially Pilar. The realism and ugliness of some of the final scenes are however difficult to watch. The ending is definitely more realistic than any typical feel good ending some people often hope for.",1384473600,,2849,4.5048355899419725

8142296,5,B000HXDWOQ,"This is a tremendously well crafted and fast moving movie about mental and physical relationship/spousal abuse.  The quote in the title to this review is from one of the husbands, talking about how his constant threats of violence and violent actions effected his wife's otherwise animated personality.

In this movie, Pilar is torn between the love for her husband and the abuse she receives from him.  She tries to reconcile the beauty and goodness she knows is in him with his violent actions and threats.

Abuse is used to control.  While abuse may be an effective means of control, it often ends up disabling the beauty, artistry, health, and emotional capacity of the controlled person. Ironically, this can lead to a cycle where the abuser understandably finds their victim less attractive in their diminished condition.

Abusive spouses tend to limit their spouse's social contacts by limiting time with friends and family and, as in this movie, limiting even their work contacts - or removing them from the working world entirely - making them more singularly dependent.  Sometimes abused spouses can be helped by reconnecting them with more people in general and by giving them the courage to fight back non-violently, calling attention to the specific abusive actions.

There's a smart scene in this movie where the abusive husband is in therapy, and he's instructed to:  a) emotionally recognize when he's getting angry, b) create separation and breathing room at that point, and c) get involved in doing or thinking about pleasant other things for awhile.  He's asked to tell the therapy group of a time in his past when he was not so stressed and when his world was at peace.  The screenwriting is great and revealing because he (Antonio) says, ""I can't remember.""  He is being sincere.  His past has few, if any, sustained memories of peaceful, intimate or familial social environments.

Helping certain abusers is very difficult, because they grew up in abusive environments.  They've never known patterns that did not involve violence as a part of regular conflict resolution patterns.  Conceding this deficiency in some abusers should give everyone working with them more empathy and understanding of their challenges.  Creating a world where there is both social peace and positive dispute resolution habits is especially difficult for these men & women.  It involves demonstrating for them intimate and socially functioning worlds - worlds they may not think really exist - outside of fictional stories.

Some people reading the title to this movie may mistakenly think this is a macabre and grotesque tale of spousal abuse.  It is not.  Rather, it shows exceptionally and sympathetically the struggles and loves of different types of people involved in these types of abuses.  There are scenes where, even though we despise Antonio's abuse of Pilar, we still understand her love for him.  Any movie that can emotionally convey something that complex and real is worth studying carefully.

During the movie's plot, Pilar and Antonio get back together.  Pilar, having tasted working and some freedom, wants to take a course on art education to become a tour guide, explaining paintings' histories and mythological roots.  Antonio struggles, watching her become more outspoken and independent.

If you don't want to know how the movie ends, then don't read this paragraph.  But I want people to know this is a gorgeous and smart movie.  Unfortunately, the husband doesn't figure things out, and he returns to his patterns of using violence.

But this movie has a healthier ending.  No, the husband doesn't eventually change his ways.  Rather, Pilar finds ways to surpass the abuse, outreaches and reconnects socially, and pursues a career in the arts.

This movie doesn't have a ""happy ending,"" but it is important to also emphasize that it is not a ""male bashing"" movie.  I have never seen a more sympathetic portrayal of a male abuser, giving us glimpses of his flawed thought processes and fears.  Ideally, I wish Antonio could have found ways to change his violent behaviors & rationales, and I wish both he and Pilar would not have lost the genuine & positive parts of their relationship . . . but that is not the story this movie tells.",1185235200,3,4260,5.045779685264664
8142297,5,B000HXDWOQ,"TE DOY MIS OJOS (Take My Eyes) is a blisteringly real examination of spousal abuse - the etiology, the mechanisms, the concept of co-dependency, and the high rate of recidivism - all bound together in a brilliant screenplay by Alicia Luna and director Ic&iacute;ar Bolla&iacute;n.  It won many Goyas (read Oscars) in Spain and for good reason: this is a powerful film about an indelicate subject from a country (Spain) not usually comfortable discussing much less film such issues.

Pilar (Laia Marull) and her son Juan (Nicol&aacute;s Fern&aacute;ndez Luna) live in a small apartment with husband/father Antonio (Luis Tosar), a small section of hell where daily Antonio abuses Pilar with an uncontrollable anger.  Pilar and Juan leave one night to live with Pilar's soon to be married sister Ana (Candela Pe&ntilde;a) and fiance, a Scotsman John (David Mooney).  Ana encourages Pilar to divorce the abusive Antonio but Pilar is frightened, fearing she has no means of support and admitting that there are parts of Antonio she still loves. Complicating Pilar's thinking is her mother Aurora (the fine Rosa Maria Sard&agrave;) who tries to underplay the problem by insisting that all marriages have their little problems! Antonio stalks Pilar, pleading for her to return, but every encounter results in a flair-up of Antonio's abusive behavior.  Pilar finds a menial job at the museum in Toledo, a position she loves and soon is training to become a guide, loving speaking tot he public about art.  Antonio agrees to seek help for his behavioral problems and enters group therapy and private therapy (Sergi Calleja) and begins bringing flowers and gifts and constant attention to Ana, hoping to have her return home.  And return Ana does, with Juan, and with some newfound sense of self worth form her position at the museum.  But as soon as Ana is 'home' a horrifying incident occurs and she gathers the strength to see the relationship clearly and respond correctly.

The cast of actors is brilliant, the pacing of the film keeps the viewer on seat's edge, the cinematography by Carles Gusi captures the magic of Toledo, Spain, the musical score by Alberto Iglesias is first rate classical writing, and the amount of information about a little understood problem is an additional reward that accompanies this superb film. The film is in Spanish with English subtitles and the DVD adds a featurette that further examines a treatment center for abusive men feels like a much needed public service ploy.  This is one of those films that would be easy to ignore because of the subject matter, but that is a real reason to view it - in addition to the fact that it is such a fine work of art.
