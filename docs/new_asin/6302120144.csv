7821358,5,6302120144,"This exploration of NFL Trivia is accompanied by some of the most interesting footage in football history. Some of the questions are pretty obscure, for example: What team holds the record for the fewest yards allowed in a game. Answer: Los Angeles Rams held the Seattle Seahawks to
-65. Wonder when that record will be broken. This video is more fun than you can imagine. Buy it before it's gone.",1219881600,,397,4.685714285714286
7821359,4,6302120144,"This video is presented by a former long snapper, Mark Ingram.  It is obvious that he is experienced at teaching the techniques and methods and philosophy of being able to long snap as his message in this video is thought out and rehearsed.  He explains the ""why"" for his ""do it this way"" instruction.  The video environment is not distracting (with the exception of a plane flying by once).  I did not get the perception that this was a ""thrown together at the last moment"" video production like others I have seen.  He covers the grip - spiral - stance - leg positioning - place holding - punt snap - field goal snap - ""Tackle Over"" - snap force and developmental drills.  There are several times where he slows the video down in slow motion and that is very helpful.

My oldest son is a center for 7th grade, but could not get the distance to be the long snapper.  We both watched the video and practiced the techniques shown.  My son was able to snap directly to me at 10.5 feet with just the right height and speed.  I was able to snap directly to him at 12 feet.  We both need a lot more polishing, but I was impressed we could make so much progress in about an hour of practice using Mark Ingram's instruction.

The reason I gave a 4 star is because there could have been more slow motion and close-ups on the hands.  The hand - arm movement is where 80% of the result is created.  I would have been better informed if the video would have shown slow motion close ups of the ball being snapped from both the right side and the left side of the ball.  Especially concerning the use of the weak hand in gripping the ball.",1200960000,,1626,4.26797385620915
7821360,2,6302120144,"In between the release of ""Pro Football Funnies"" and its sequel, ""Pro Football: The Lighter Side,"" the folks at Halcyon Days Productions seem to have spent some time watching some time watching some of the ""Follies"" films produced by NFL Films and tried to imitate their humor. It's a tall order to find anyone with the comic talent of Mel Blanc and the unwavering professionalism of John Facenda. Unfortunately, the people Halcyon Days used for comic relief in this 1989 video seem to have been recruited from their local public access station. They have no sense of how to embellish the USFL footage of ""The Lighter Side"" with humor. At one point, one of these commentators resorts to something unoriginal - he quotes Andy Griffith's ""What It Was Was Football"" record. I assure you this man is no Andy Griffith. Others think it's cute to call the USFL the WFL, mispronounce the word ""annals,"" or to say that the Denver Gold fans have assembled at their home field for a game that's being played in Los Angeles. Fortunately, main narrator Curt Chaplin does not make the juvenile remarks the other speakers make. He does bring some air of dignity to the production.

""The Lighter Side,"" unlike ""Pro Football Funnies,"" lacks a narrative structure. Football scenes are pieced together at random. A lot of scenes involve hard-to-handle pigskins and players losing their footing. The video simply meanders from one segment to another, and throws in old film footage for no purpose apparent to me. Other footage comes from the USFL, but has nothing to do with the games. For example, Halcyon Days devotes one segment to a montage of USFL cheerleaders set to generic dance music. Others go the practice field of the Tampa Bay Bandits, where offensive lineman Nate Newton fights a battle to keep his playing weight under 300 pounds, and even jokes about his situation. The Bandits linemen are also seen relaxing by playing a game of ""walk touch,"" where they play touch football, but never run. The game is one of the more interesting segments, as these linemen get their own opportunity to be the skill position players.

Also, Halcyon Days did little to identify the players included. Newton is the only player mentioned by name, but future NFL stars, such as Steve Young and Reggie White, can briefly be seen. The Denver Gold coach, who comes across as a buffoon in this video, is Craig Morton, who played in the NFL for nearly two decades with the Cowboys, Giants, and Broncos. One of the more exciting plays in ""The Lighter Side"" involves Michigan Panthers cornerback Fred Logan. After intercepting a Birmingham Stallions pass, Logan rolls into the end zone, and celebrates the interception before he's downed for a touchback. He's stripped of the ball by Stallions receiver Ron Frederick, and the ball is recovered by Birmingham's Darryl Mason for an apparent touchdown (Though not seen, officials later called the play a touchback). Other shots include hard hits and miked conversations of huddles, but don't show football's light side. A little bit of the footage, including the Logan interception, was also a part of ""Pro Football Funnies.""

""Pro Football: The Lighter Side"" lives up to its name in a most dubious way. Apparently, Halcyon Days made enough of a profit on ""Pro Football Funnies"" to make a sequel. The sequel, though, is light on new material, humor, or much new insight to the fun side of football. This video, I suspect will appeal most to hardcore football enthusiasts, especially those who want to own footage from the USFL. Chaplin states at the end that fans crave blooper footage. That may be, but fans want the footage to do the majority of the talking. This presentation, though, has more bloopers off the field than it does on it.

The Big play between Cal and Stanford from 1982 and Harvard with an upset tie over Yale among other things. Get ready to laugh out loud!
