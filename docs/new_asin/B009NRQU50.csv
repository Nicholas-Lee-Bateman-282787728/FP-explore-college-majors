5357815,2,B009NRQU50,"There is no doubt that this movie has the perfect atmosphere and setting for this type of film. And there is no doubt that Ashley Greene is very attractive, and she does her best to save the film and at times she does; she has great facial expressions but she delivers some of her lines poorly. Sebastian Stan gives a weak performance as her boyfriend, however, and a strong male lead was needed for the film to give it a boost (just like Patrick Wilson's performance boosted the movie ""Insidious""). But this story is not as strong, and the cast is weak, there is not that much going on throughout the film.

This is not a bad movie, especially if you are with friends or going with a date. But if you are really in the mood for a good story you can sink your teeth into, of if you are looking for an intense, violent type of film, you won't find it here. The movie appears to have all the right elements, and looks great while it's on the screen. But it leaves nothing behind when it's done.",1346544000,3,992,4.248677248677248
5357816,2,B009NRQU50,"This unfortunate attempt to combine elements of the Poltergeist (1982, 1986, 1988), Pulse (2001, 2006, 2008), and Paranormal Activity (2007, 2010, 2011, 2012) franchises fails on all accounts leaving only mediocrity in its wake.  No good scares, tired effects and an unengaging story leave me with but one suggestion for you:  SKIP IT.

The Gist--The concept is interesting enough.  Some young attractive folks test a theory that ghosts only exist because we believe in them.  Ergo, to believe in a ghost can facilitate the manifestation of one.  It works, ""it"" is pissed, and it haunt-hunts them down one by one.  The imagery and F/X strategy feel just like Pulse (but with Grudge-y dirty ghost hands).  Like I said, the ""concept"" is interesting--if only watching it unfold in this movie was, too.

The movie begins when Patrick (Tom Felton; Rise of the Planet of the Apes), Ben (Sebastian Stan; Political Animals) and Lydia (Julianna Guill; Friday the 13th) re-enact a famous sance called The Charles Experiment in hopes of manifesting a ghost.  They succeed and we are deprived of enjoying any more screentime of Julianna Guill as she is Pulse-sucked into/through a wall.

With no explanation of what happened in the ensuing years, life goes on and Ben is now living with his new girlfriend Kelly (Ashley Greene; the Twilight saga) in a quiet housing development just like the one in Poltergeist.  However, when strange things start happening in their home, he realizes that the ghost he had summoned years ago has found him.  Not wanting her to ""believe"" in the apparition, he passes off weird happenings on kids playing pranks and faulty electrical connections.  When things get a little too scary for comfort, he reunites with Patrick to help combat the ghost.

The actors all do fine--nothing stellar, but actually good for a horror release.  Greene is credibly rattled, Stan does fine, and it was nice seeing Felton play a non-douchebag.  However, the paranormal effects were random, uninteresting, unimpressive, and even felt gratuitous.  Doors open, a dresser shifts six inches, furniture is rearranged and lights go out--never in an effective manner that may make you jump or feel tense or uneasy.  Then there was the Pulse-y haunted slime mold...

So, they start finding slime mold deposits around the house.  It's gross and looks like a honey-combed, rotten, zombie, yellowjacket nest.  Evidently this is symptomatic of an evil presence.  While it's gross, it serves no real purpose in the movie other than devaluing Ben and Kelly's house and demonstrating that the filmmakers really didn't know how to handle this movie.  Or the ghost itself, in fact, as it is depicted in multiple forms so different I'd struggle to agree that it was only one ghost with one motive and one supernatural skill set.

Biggest Horror Faux Pas:  The most nerve-wracking scene in the movie--which really wasn't that effective, just the most effective--involved a supernatural smothering bedspread assault on Kelly.  Such a tactic was employed in A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984) and it was very effective even with limited effects.  However, in The Apparition, I was troubled for different reasons.  You see, evidently Kelly was using rubber sheets to solve a bedwetting problem because this bedspread was somehow suffocating her.  Later in the movie, the ghost just uses some powerful telekinesis to suck someone to their doom in the laundry room.  Why didn't it just use that power?  In fact, why was it playing with light switches and feng shui for the last hour of running time?  They explain the ghost's motives in the movie and they don't explain this behavior.

Second Biggest Horror Faux Pas:  The greatest idiocy of the movie was in how ""the team"" tries to eradicate the ghost in end.  They go with the old ""satanic metal band album played backwards"" routine.  You know.  Just play the EEG recording signal (produced when they manifested the ghost) in reverse and it should send the thing back to Hell, right?  That makes sense, right?  Maaaaybe not.  I think the writer was thinking of summoning some evil thing by playing a death metal album in reverse--like in one of my old favorites: The Gate (1987).  But never does playing the album ""forward"" send the demon back to Hell.

Basically, everything about this movie is stupid and inconsistent.  Don't see it unless you simply have a hankering for seeing Ashley Greene in her underwear.

WHAT TO WATCH INSTEAD:  Poltergeist (1982, 1986), Pulse (2001) and the Paranormal Activity (2007, 2010, 2011, 2012) franchise.",1345939200,3,4567,5.021304926764314
5357817,3,B009NRQU50,"Essentially this is another entry into the vengeful spirit/ghost genre. The setup is a little different than other movies though.

Plot:

Based on previous events of the ""Charles Experiment"" where a group of professionals summoned up a spirit, a college student Ben (Sebastian Stan) and his friend Patrick (Tom Felton), and girlfriend Lydia (Julianna Guill) end up doing the same thing. However, the spirit ends up being quite an evil spirit literally swallowing up his girlfriend. Years pass and Ben has moved on with another girl Kelly (Ashley Greene). Ben has moved on but not the spirit that he summoned. Ben, Kelly and Patrick will have to find a way to send back the spirit to where it came from or perish.

Well for starters the acting was pretty good. Ashley Greene who is super hot in this does a pretty good in the lead as the scared girlfriend who doesn't know what her boyfriend has gotten himself into. Sebastian Stan is fine as the boyfriend who doesn't quite know how to deal with the situation. Tom Felton is ok as the paranormal expert who comes in midway in the movie to try and save them.

The special effects for the film were ok. Some of the effects were the usual mundane stuff you will see in any ghost movies, but there is one effective scene in the film in a hotel room that is nicely done.

The soundtrack is also very good.

The bad thing about the movie is that is pretty predictable. The setup for conjuring the spirit through the minds of its participants could have set up  several twists in the movie, but instead it ends up being a straight by the numbers survival horror story. The jump scares you see coming with the exception of a few like the hotel scene.

All in all, it's an ok little ghost flick. I saw this in the premiere in LA with Ashley Greene in attendance. I didn't hate it just though it could have been better, but I did enjoy my time watching it.",1345766400,,1896,4.459537572254336

5357842,3,B009NRQU50,"My half star thing applies on this review. If I could give half stars this film would rate lower.

For me the film has some serious potential for scares but unfortunately it is as if the director pulled back on most of the scary moments instead of going for broke. Moments when the scenes begin to build to thrilling climaxes the actual luster fades and we are almost pre-warned or backed down from a true terrifying moment. With that said there are some scary moments that make you jump but there could have been so many more. The surreal and ominous atmosphere that is created in this more subdued supernatural horror film is intense and foreboding which give to the storys dark nature. The casual and serious approach to the story casts an almost monotone of mournfulness even when the scene doesnt call for such emotion which sometimes creates a somewhat sleeper moment to the film. The story around the paranormal entity however is intense, dark and sinister which hold most of this movie tightly together and give us our actual active scary moments. The Apparition didn't completely leave me disappointed but it did slightly frustrate me. I found myself forcing complete interest in the movie as it went along, and never felt quite convinced it was a horror movie. It is a film that one could take or leave and never be the lesser for doing so.",1433462400,,1350,4.6722689075630255

Intelligent and fun, suspenseful and eerie right up to the end. no ridiculous air heads running about screaming to break the sound barrier, no dreary boyfriend, girlfriend subplots.

these folks are in deep poo, not only with the malevolent spirits but mom and dad ain't gonna be too happy about their investment property being turned into another poltergeist sequel while their daughter was supposed to be looking after it.
Unfortunately, missy has her hands full and boyfriend conveniently neglected to tell her that the spook machine unleashed spirits with anti-social tendencies and have attached themselves to him.
so essentially he's like a supernatural Typhoid Mary spreading spiritual malevolence wherever he goes.

5357849,3,B009NRQU50,"Decent story line although a bit overwrought. Not really scary, but some good creepy moments and effects. Unfortunately, instead of building the story, they spend way too much time on elements that don't scare or further the story.

This film is also another example of a new trend (new to American horror) where it's too late and the experiment/science/apocalypse is too far gone to be corrected so the the 'good guys' can't snatch victory from the jaws of the enemy and 'win'. Instead, they lose, we lose, the world loses. Part of the fun in horror is the defeat of evil, albeit with some losses along the way, and setting things right (or at least closing the portal for another day). If you take that away what's the point? Why bother? Some horror with a nihilistic view (i.e. Japanese stories like The Grudge) works very well, but I hate to see the sun-is-rising-we-beat-the-bad-guys-but-left-room-for-doubt genre, that American filmmakers especially do so well, be replaced by copies of something done better elsewhere. The sub-genres and their influence on each other keep the whole genre fresh and make for great choice in horror. I hope that stays the case.",1423526400,,1166,4.948979591836735
5357850,3,B009NRQU50,Ending left me hanging!,1417910400,,23,5.0
5357851,3,B009NRQU50,"The Apparition starts off with a flashback to May 21st, 1973 where a group of people conduct The Charles Experiment, a seance where they stare at the picture of a dead man by the name of Charles Reamer, hoping to summon his spirit and communicate with him. Many years later in modern times, college students Lydia, Patrick, Greg, and Ben try their hand at The Charles Experiment but with more modern and advanced technology. However something goes terribly wrong during the experiment and Lydia is attacked by an unseen force and supposedly pulled through the ceiling and is never seen from again.

The film jumps to more current times where Ben (Sebastian Green) and his beautiful girlfriend, Kelly (Ashley Greene) are living together in a quiet suburban neighborhood. Things don't stay quiet for long however when a multitude of horrible, supernatural happenings begin taking place inside of the house. After Kelly is nearly killed one night by this apparition, they contact paranormal specialist, Patrick, who was also one of the ones that partook in the Charles Experiment with Ben. After Patrick reveals to Ben and Kelly that the house itself is not the problem, but rather that this apparition studies humans and feeds on their fears no matter where they run; Ben and Kelly come to the realization that no matter where they run or hide, there is no possible escape from this supernatural force

Overall: When I first picked up the Apparition, I was expecting it to be a pretty good film but it was quite the opposite. While the plot of the movie seems slightly different from other horror movies these days, the story-telling behind the plot is very slow, which is bound to turn away the viewer's interest and attention from the movie in a hurry. Because of that, The Apparition doesn't really come off as being scary either. I suppose if you watch this alone, in the dark, and with surround sound, you may get a little scared. The overall meaning of the movie can get you thinking about things though if you're the one who believes in spirits and such. Overall, The Apparition is okay for a watch maybe once or twice but that's probably it.",1412726400,2,2147,4.784366576819407

5357854,1,B009NRQU50,"With it's slapdash nature, its tiresome reliance on the overused ""found footage"" gimmick and an ending so abrupt and unsatisfying that it signaled a basic contempt for anyone who paid money to bear witness to it, the cheapo horror film The Devil Inside was roundly derided by critics and audiences alike, although enough of the latter ignored enough of the former to give it a frighteningly lucrative opening weekend. That said, it did prove to be oddly comforting for legions of horror fans in a weird way-no matter what curve balls the genre might throw at them, there was no possibility that there could be a worse film of that type released in the remainder of 2012. Well, with a little more than four months lift in the year, that promise was broken with the emergence of The Apparition, a spooky story so bafflingly bad on every possible level that if one were to put it up against the legendarily klutzy likes of Plan 9 from Outer Space or Manos: Hands of Fate, there is an excellent chance that it would come out as being the poorer in the eyes of most viewers.

After no fewer than two introductory prologues-including one so incredibly superfluous to the rest of the proceedings that it seems to have been tacked on from another movie in a desperate bid to drag the film kicking and screaming to a feature length-the story proper opens as comely veterinary Kelly and her dopey techie boyfriend Ben head off to a remote housing development-the kind of place where one gets a definite moved-the-headstones-but-left-the-bodies vibe-to open up one of the homes for her mother to sell. They have hardly begun to settle in when the expected weird things begin to happen-doors open and close on their own accord, huge outbreaks of mold suddenly appear and the shower curtain becomes just opaque enough when Kelly turns up for an elongated rinsing to keep the proceedings well within the confines of a PG-13 rating. After this goes on for what feels like seventeen hours or so, Kelly discovers that Ben has not been honest about his past. It seems that a few years earlier, he took part in a college experiment to lure and capture a spirit and prove once and for all that ghosts really exist. Unsurprisingly, things went gunny back then and now that same spirit has returned to destroy those that freed it, anyone that they love and any poor schmuck, neighborhood puppy or cactus that gets in its way.

The Apparition was presumably launched hurriedly into production in an effort to cash in on the popularity of the ridiculously popular Paranormal Activity series by ripping them off completely, but as shocking as it may sound, it actually does even less with them than the PA films. Aside from serving as a splendid showcase for Ashley Greene's legs, it not only fails to do anything right but spectacularly wrong that it appears to have been made by people who have only heard about what constitutes a proper horror film by osmosis. The story, for example, is such a mess in regards to even the most basic fundamentals of narrative that it will no doubt give hope to many aspiring screenwriters on the basis that if something as half-assed and incoherent as this can get produced and released, imagine what might be done with something that makes sense.

The direction by Todd Lincoln is so incompetent that it seems as though it has been made by someone who has never even seen a film before-the entire thing seems like a random assemblage of footage mistakenly retrieved from the cutting room incinerator and generates zero scared, tension, excitement or any know emotional reactions outside of incredulous laughter or unceasing boredom. ""How boring is it?"", one might ask. It is so boring that if you could magically transform this film into music, the entire thing would be a drum solo. It is so boring that a bit in which Kelly peels some linoleum off the floor is the closest that it comes to breakneck action.

Of course, when a movie gets reviews as bad as the ones that The Apparition generated, there is always a certain sector willing to embrace it as some kind of unintentionally hilarious camp classic-witness the cult fandom that has sprung up around the likes of the aforementioned Plan 9 or Manos or the more recent The Room. Do not be fooled for a minute, though, because this is one of the most excruciating wastes of 74 perfectly good minutes imaginable.",1407801600,2,4379,4.727748691099476

5357860,3,B009NRQU50,"This was not a great movie by any means, but to give it one star (the lowest rating available) to me means it is unwatchable or so bad it's laughable.  Two stars (to me) means it was bad and not even laughable.  This movie was okay.  It did not have a lot of thrills or scares, but it did have one kind of neat scene involving a door being nailed shut and the result of the finished product.  I did not care for the ending and I'm not  really sure how we got to that ending, but whatever.  The acting was not horrible and it was able to keep my interest for the 82 minutes or so of its run.  Another reviewer wrote that the lead actress (Ashley Greene) spent most of the movie in a bikini or skimpy underwear. I must have purchased a different version. There was one scene (about 3 minutes long) where she walked around in a black nightie that was not particularly revealing and I kept thinking. ""If you're going outside, put some clothes on"".  Anyway, my point is that some of the one star ratings here just don't deal with the movie accurately.  Another one star rating listed the pros and cons of the movie.  I can't remember what was written but it struck me as very inaccurate as to what really happened in the movie. Some other reviewer mentioned the cover. All I can say is..If you watch the movie then look at the cover, you'll see that there is a glaring error. About the ending. When I saw the ending coming, I thought about the great possibilities we had here and from the start of the final scene, I thought the crew of this film was really on to something. They let me down, copping out for a standard ""we couldn't come up with an original idea"" ending.  Major disappointment. The bottom line here is that this is not a great movie and you can do much better, but if you want to watch it and give it a try it's not the worst film you'll ever see. I bought it, then watched it and did not feel ripped off. You can't really ask for much more than that when you pick up a dvd you never heard of.  Well, you can, but seldom do you get it.",1401062400,,2047,4.141414141414141

5357864,1,B009NRQU50,"I have seen some bad movies in my time. I am a fan of the series ""Mystery Science Theatre 3000"", which ripped on older bad movies. But The Apparition... this movie is in a class by itself. Putting aside the fact that the entire cast is just phoning it in (including the neighbor's dog), the plot and storyline is so clich that I already had most of the plot figured out within the first ten minutes of the movie.

So, without much fanfare, lets list the flaws. I'll try and keep the spoilers to a minimum, but really I am trying to prevent you from wasting your time and money on this flick. However, in the interest of fairness I will alert you beforehand if a plot point is exposed so that you can move on to the next point.

1) The two main protagonists: Kelly (Ashley Greene) and Ben (Sebastian Stan) are supposedly a couple who live together in this beautiful, upscale housing community in California. Kelly is a vet tech and Ben is a TV/cable generic technology guy. Aside from the fact that they are polar opposites, their chemistry together initially made me think that Ben is a serial killer. Any intimate contact seems forced.

2) *Minimal Spoilers, this is revealed at the beginning of the movie* The plot is simple: film footage shows a sance with a group of people from the 60s or 70s using a painting of a man that looks like an Edward Munch reject, and manage to get a reaction. Fast forward to years later, a group of (presumably) college students with fancy equipment decide to repeat the experiment, only THIS time they will get him to stick around in this vaguely-looking clay doll. Something goes wrong.

3) So you have this ""evil"" apparition floating around. Between moving the dresser a foot away so that ""Kelly"" had to *omg* turn around to put clothes away, and then it *scream* watched her in the SHOWER!! *swoon*, the first half the the movie makes the monster more concerned with killing plants and vandalizing property. Quick! Call an insurance adjuster!

4) While Kelly was in the shower, she made darn sure to stand at odd angles (you couldn't see her directly, only as a silhouette through the curtain) and to clean herself slowly. The same thing happened when she got out; she had to dry off and bend over to get clothes on one painful step at a time, accentuating her figure/apparent sexiness. It was quite clear that the director told her to do this as no one in their right mind would act like that on their own.

5) The relationship between the two protagonists never improves. I'm fairly sure they're siblings.

In the End

At this point all that I can say is that I am sure this movie constitutes the definition of a horrible weapon and is in violation of the Geneva Convention. Bad acting, boring plot, camerawork that tends to focus too much on what isn't happening rather than what is (example, there are things moving around but the camera is focused on someone's face in another room), make this a film to avoid. I wouldn't even offer it up to the MST3K guys now for their new show (which escapes my mind at the moment). So, in short, don't buy this, hell, don't even rent this. Your time is worth more than ""The Apparition"".",1398038400,,3167,4.514834205933682

5357869,2,B009NRQU50,"This is a problematic movie.  To begin with, the blurb about the plot on the back of my DVD case is misleading.  It begins, ""Theorizing that the paranormal exists as a result of human belief, a group of students attempts to create a supernatural entity.""  This is patently false; whoever wrote that must have been spared the chore of actually having to watch this, since nowhere in this movie does anyone attempt to ""create"" anything--the students are merely channeling the entity that is the subject of the haunting.

In terms of visual appeal, this movie is standard fare.  Acting-wise it falls short.  But the plot?  Blechhh.  Read on.

It begins with a group of students trying to channel the spirit of a dead man after the pattern of a 1970s experiment that attempted the same.  This time, though, they're using fancy science gizmos!  So, naturally, it's all very scholarly and respectable.  The explanations given by the lead scientist about his research and equipment are (intentionally?) outlandish and nonsensical throughout, but the gist is that his machines amplify human brainwaves for a procedure that resembles a seance.  Of the three students involved, only one--the guy with the accent and the glasses--even pretends to know what's going on.  Apart from summoning a powerful entity that consumes one of them, what can go wrong?

We cut to some time later, as Ben, one of the surviving two students, builds a new life with some bimbo, who he shacks up with in a cookie-cutter subdivision in the middle of nowhere.  Their brand new residence is her parents' otherwise vacant ""investment property.""  (Apparently her parents don't have any qualms about financing what is clearly a sex pad for their daughter and her boyfriend.)  It doesn't take long before spookiness ensues.  Ben, who obviously has knowledge of what's happening, is reluctant to confide in his girlfriend.  This begs the question:  What's the twist?  Is she somehow the entity given physical form, and she doesn't know what she is?  (No.)  Is he possessed by the entity?  (No.)  Do the nearby electrical towers play into the phenomena at all?  (No.)  The twist is, there is no twist.  The plot is linear and obvious.

Eventually Ben clues his girlfriend in and they find Patrick, the geeky student with all the answers.  He tells them what we all already know--the problem isn't the house, it's the entity that they've unleashed.  So what's his solution?  That they all go back to the house for the Great Big Showdown, and watch as the resulting paranormal activity literally breaks the investment home to pieces!  Once they're satisfied that they've defeated the entity with some iffy science, Patrick offhandedly passes Ben's girlfriend a piece of paper.  To paraphrase what he says next, ""I'm about to die in the next scene, so here are the directions to my lab, where you'll need to go to advance the rest of the plot.""

I won't spoil the ending, except to say, it stinks!",1392940800,,2956,4.889112903225806
5357870,4,B009NRQU50,"I was mildly surprised by this film, I watched the trailer and thought it would be fun, but it's been getting some bad reviews so I wasn't expecting much. It actually turned out to be a decent horror film, not the greatest film but certainly worth a watch.

The story starts with some students attempting to prove that supernatural phenomena is caused by belief, the experiment succeeds but they have to abort when things go crazy. The film then skips a few years to a young couple moving into a new house and sinister events plague them in their new home.

While the overall story isn't anything special it does have some interesting developments (I liked the explanation of the entity's existence) and it is paced well. It's other downside is the reliance on shock (sudden movements and so forth) to generate its  horror (a failing of many modern horror films), however there are some good takes on the usual take.

The performances are also good and despite the reliance of shock it does build enough of an atmosphere to carry the film. Overall I enjoyed it.",1392508800,2,1061,4.657754010695188

Thus, the moment i saw his name credited to this movie, i decided to watch it.  Well, after setting my eyes upon this Visual Flatulence of Film, i feel as though i have been personally violated by ""said"" Actor.

Here's an example of how poorly written this film is.

Sebastian Stan (yes, that's him!) goes to a Mexican restaurant with his girlfriend Ashley Greene. Firstly, these two should have been cast as brother and sister.  There is absolutely NO CHEMISTRY between them.  She might as well have hooked up with the Harry Potter co-star in this movie and would have gotten the same effect.

He has a job that apparently isn't working out for him.  She works at a Vet Clinic or possibly dog grooming - doesn't matter. He begins to tell her that he doesn't think he's cut out for the job.  Now, if my boyfriend would look at me and tell me that?  I'd listen, and start charting out options, put our heads together, etc.  What does this chick say? ""Oh, you had a bad day at work? GET OVER IT"" .. then commences to throwing tortilla chips at him to ""cheer him up"".. SERIOUSLY??

Sorry folks, if that were me? Home girl would be wearing the menudo - with chips, and given the check.

Other than that, it's obvious how Ashley got the lead role.  (Yep, walking around half naked in lingerie).

The true spark of the movie was actually THE DOG.  Yes, people, THE DOG.  He played his role with amazing accuracy, and heart-felt emotion.  His 15 seconds of fame commenced when he walked into Sebastian Stan's (yes, that's him!) home and...died...that's right folks the dog just walks into their house lies down and gives up the ghost.  Far better than any of the actors would performed this magnificent and tragic feat... Which is probably why this part was given to the dog. (Kudos!)

The rest of the movie is pretty much material ripped off from Ghost Hunters, Paranormal Witness, Ghost Chasers, Beer with Chasers, etc.,

Don't believe me?  Here's an example:  The couple hears a noise, ""Did you hear that?"" they both look to the right, the camera pans to the right - nothing.

One of the crew members throws a pebble to the left.  ""Did you hear that?""  couple looks left, camera pans left - nothing. (Crew member retrieves pebble before camera pans left)..

and let's not forget to mention the knotted clothes in the closet - and the mold. (Top notch special effects, as one possibly ""sheltered-life"" reviewer stated.) Seriously?

And apparently, the team of producers/directors/writers (if there were any) didn't give a rip about the movie. Why?  The poster is END of the movie.  No spoiler alert needed here, folks.  No wonder it was shelved for 2 years.. I'd shelve this piece of crap for longer than that.

oh, and Shame on you Sebastian Stan!  You could have made more money doing a Play Girl Spread. Shameless, yes, but at least you would have been forgiven for it.",1383782400,2,3024,4.62406015037594

  We are shown a millimeter film from 1973 of a seance taking place. With six paranormal psychologists sitting around the table, a drawing of a Charles Reamer is placed on the table. Charles was a former colleague who recently passed away. The table begins to jump wildly. They now call it ""The Charles Experiment"".
  In 2012, College students, Patrick (Tom Felton) along with Greg (Luke Pasqualino) and Lydia (Juliana Guill) are conducting ""The Charles Experiment"" of their own in the lab. Lydia has made a small 3-D statue of Charles she made in engineering. Patrick believes this experiment is going to work.  As they concentrate, something happens. It was a thud from under the table. Then the table moves wildly. Then another thud. They hear creaking in the ventilation ducts. Then a crash. Greg and Lydia are scared. Lydia is breathing heavily. A camera knocks over. More creaking and banging. What is it? You will have to see the movie to find out.

Kelly (Ashley Greene) and Ben (Sebastian Stan) are a couple. They have just moved in to a new house in Palmdale, California. Strange things begins to happen.

Know how you can just tell when they're not? Well, there ya go; we have an instance of the latter here, which explains how such an intriguing concept could go so terribly awry.

Where to start? The thin script is uninspired and lacking in background info, strong dialogue, and believable motivation. The direction . . . hell, I'm not even convinced there was a director on-set. The female lead is nothing more than a blinged-out Barbie doll with about as much acting ability. There's no atmosphere to cultivate viewer apprehension, and no effects to provide the payoff.

The cast acts like they're all bored out of their minds and reading their scripts off cue cards just waiting to be done. Their emotional depth is shallower than the average puddle. The plotline is written as though it was completed by an eight year old and is about as coherent, if not less so.
I paid five bucks to see this and luckily I was able to laugh it off with my fianc. We've seen a lot of bad movies and over time have just learned to laugh at them because I'm sure not going to give this piece of worthless trash the dignity of my rage.

5357898,2,B009NRQU50,"Those who've submitted negative reviews here on amazon for the Apparition are NOT exaggerating- this movie is a disaster.  As someone who loves being frightened by ghosts and hauntings, the storyline sure had a ton of promise, and that's exactly why I bothered watching it in the first place.  I eagerly anticipated this one last night.

An apparition haunts the lives of a man and his girlfriend who move into a suburban desert home.  The girlfriend (played by Ashley Greene) initially has NO idea that her boyfriend released an apparition into reality, so for a while she questions what's going on when odd events occur in the home, and initially chalks them up to being unexplainable coincidences (such as a small cactus plant suddenly dying upon bringing it home from the store).

Clearly, this movie is intended for those who have a major crush on Ashley Greene (admittedly, I do as well) because the movie is all about focusing on Ashley's noticeable lack of clothing and overall hot and revealing body and facial appearance.  At just under 75 minutes (not including the credits) the storyline never even gets off the ground either.

The actual apparition segments are *incredibly* disappointing.  Drawers and garage doors open by themselves, the dog suddenly becomes sick without explanation, and several other things you've seen a bunch of times in other horror films.  This movie uses one specific trick and uses it almost every single time a scare occurs- whenever Ashley or her boyfriend turns around, something happens *then*.  For example, in one scene when Ashley closes her bedroom drawer, the camera shows Ashley face the other way, and when she turns back the drawer is now open.  This same trick is used time and time again.  It stops being effective after a while.

Even worse, there's almost *zero* devotion to building a horror atmosphere or creative storyline.  The apparition just does things instantaneously, and it's supposed to be enough to create fear for the viewers.  However the movie writers forgot to take notes and watch the original Amityville Horror to see how atmosphere and storyline build-up is *really* supposed to be done.

I like a couple scenes.  The one with the couple finally realizing that an apparition has entered their home, so they spend the night in a hotel room is probably the very best one.  What almost made me think was an example of sleep paralysis, the man wakes up and sees his girlfriend being overwhelmed and strangled by a bed sheet, so he jumps up and rips it off.  Good segment here.  Also the one where Ashley's trapped (nailed shut) in a room and sees a black-haired female apparition coming out of the wall from behind and ominously crawls closer while Ashley desperately tries to remove the nails and escape in time had me somewhat terrified.

The ending though... it's awful.  I won't spoil what happens, but I will say this- it's not enough.  It's a cop out, basically.  You can interpret it a couple different ways if you really wanted to analyze it, but I can't stop interpreting it the obvious way it appears.  I strongly recommend skipping this one.  The poor, almost rushed way Ashley frequently delivers her lines is another indication that not much thought went into this one.  Skip it.",1368316800,2,3263,4.874773139745916

5357951,1,B009NRQU50,"This starts badly and goes downhill from there. After a not-very-dramatic seance scene, the next 30 minutes shows the most boring couple in California exhibit their zero chemistry to the audience. They go shopping at Costco, they buy a cactus, they install CCTV at home, they eat together, they drive around together and - just to cap it off - they live in a new subdivision in a new suburb of wherever. Pretty much every scene in the first act is completely unnecessary.

If you're still awake when we get into act 2, not much happens here either. It steals ideas from The Grudge, Dark Water and many other better films. There's the token British guy who provides the exposition that ""bad things are going to happen"", a dead girl climbs out of the dryer and lights flicker on and off. The final act is even less interesting than the previous two and somehow ends up back in a Costco.

Before anyone accuses me of giving away spoilers, the trailer for this film gives away the supposed twist at the ending, the cover shows the shot from the final scene, and the tagline (""Once you believe, you die"") is never explained in any way whatsoever. The trailer concept clearly shows that a group of researchers bring a ghost into existence through sheer belief and this is never explored at all through the movie.

In terms of production values, there aren't any. The lighting is poor, the soundtrack doesn't match the action and the dialog is bordering on student improv. I remember reading screenplays at school with scenes where people make coffee or walk to dog just to fill pages and nearly two thirds of this movie consists of this filler material - and it's only an 82 minute film! None of the characters have any motivation whatsoever, the ghost isn't explained and ultimately it's a few shots they wanted to copy from other horror films mixed in with 80 minutes of junk.

I haven't seen a movie this bad in years. It doesn't have a single redeeming quality and there are much scarier 2-3 minute shorts on YouTube.",1357948800,4,2015,4.620111731843576

5357954,5,B009NRQU50,"I hadn't seen the film ""The Apparition"" before watching it through Amazon instant video, and I was skeptical regarding its viewing value.  I hadn't heard much about it (either good or bad) from its time in the theaters this past year, which is never a good sign.  Likewise, when I read some of the Amazon reviews people wrote about this film, they were a mixed bag.  Those who enjoyed it didn't really give too much substantive information on why they liked it, those who hated it really only seemed to harp on the argument of ""same old, tired theme we've all seen and heard,"" and those who felt indifferent about it said it was a ""so-so"" movie.  Needless to say, these reviews didn't really help me determine if I would enjoy this movie, but I went ahead and watched it anyway.  I have to say that, for what it is, ""The Apparition"" is a very good movie and should be given a chance.

There were several things I liked about the movie.  First, the movie shifts between Kelly and Ben as the main character.  After the prologue scene, the audience is led to believe that this movie is about Kelly (Ashley Greene) because she appears first.  As the movie progresses, however, a lot more attention is placed on Ben (Sebastian Stan), leading us to think this entire movie has more to do with him, and that Kelly is experiencing residual or indirect paranormal attention because of him.  Near the end, the movie then completely focuses on Kelly (I won't tell you why, you'll see it for yourself).  I wouldn't say this is a ""back-and-forth"" between the main characters; this film is about Kelly AND Ben.  But what I liked was that, as the movie unfolds, you begin to understand that the supernatural element of the movie has more to do with one of them than the other.  Second, I thought the acting was very good.  Ashley Greene did a good job of portraying a paranormally nave, girl-next-door kind of person, who subsequently descends into confusion, betrayal, and utter fear.  Sebastian Stan did an excellent job of portraying a distant and closed-off guy who's trying to come to grips with what he's experienced in the past.  At first Stan appears kind of stilted, and you might think Greene is going to have to carry this film.  But as we get to know more of Stan's character, we begin to see that he knows something and his initial ""stiltedness"" is due to that something.  Once this realization came out, I could see how well he had played that off in the beginning of the film.  Tom Felton (Patrick) did a really good job at playing a genius-level, somewhat dramatic, and semi-paranoid researcher into the paranormal, and I thought his character served as good support for Kelly and Ben.  Third, the approach to the ""ghost"" was very unique.  The trailer(s) for this film originally based the plot off of a recent idea in paranormal studies, which claims ghosts probably aren't disembodied spirits, but simply products of our imaginations; we create the ghosts by thinking about them and believing in them ""hard enough.""  But this isn't what the movie is about at all!  I suppose you can kind of get that idea from watching the very beginning of the film, but the movie mostly operates off of the premise that a person whom a group tried to contact long ago (and succeeded) might not have actually been that person, but someone else.  ""The Apparition"" takes this premise and leaves the audience mostly in the dark about who the entity might be and what it wants, until near the end, when you get a surprise on the nature of the entity (I'm not going to tell you what the surprise is, but I will tell you that it's not that the characters believed in the ghost enough to make it come into existence).  I thought this plot line was handled well, and it made the film enjoyable to watch.  Similarly, this seems to be a semi-new feature in the horror genre today.  The idea that you can try to contact the dead is not new in horror stories; what it new, however, is the idea that you might end up contacting ""the wrong party"" in such instances, which, if handled correctly, can make for a fresh perspective on the old ghost story.  Finally, it was relatively short.  For what it was, this film was good at 83 minutes in length.  I don't think this story could've gone on for much longer.  It wasn't that I was getting bored, it's just that I don't think this film had enough juice to get us to 90 or 100 minutes and not think less of it.  Because of these features, I gave it 5 stars.  For all that it was and was meant to be, I think it did a great job.

In light of this, there were two things I disliked about the movie, one dealing with PR and the other dealing with an element in the film.  First, I really wish whoever had sat down and originally watched the movie to figure out how to advertise it had actually paid attention.  The movie was advertised to the public as being a ghost story, in which ghosts result from being believed in (and then subsequently kill you).  While that would've been an interesting plot line (if done well), that really wasn't in the movie.  I kept looking for it, but couldn't find it.  Perhaps I missed it (though I don't think so).  Second, electricity played a large role in dealing with the paranormal entity.  I kind of understood the significance of electricity as the movie progressed, but one thing I could never understand was the full significance of power lines.  Power lines show up fairly prominently in this movie, but I was never exactly sure of their point: did the entity use these to camp out or travel to people? did the power lines act like a magnet, drawing the attention of the entity? did the power lines serve as some sort of energy source for the entity, and if so, for what purpose? etc.  A further or more clear explanation of the shots of power lines would have been nice.  Maybe they were just meant to frame the landscape, I don't know.

I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes scary movies.  There really isn't a narrow proportion of the population who would or wouldn't like this movie.  I suppose it's kind of a hit-or-miss: you'll either like it or you won't.  But as far as entertainment value is concerned, either the plot line will draw you in or the creepiness throughout the film will make you laugh or shudder.  Just try it out.  You might be pleasantly surprised.",1357689600,3,6345,4.503496503496503

It was hard to watch, I developed no connection with the main characters, and I wondered if it was a local job. Just a day or two after watching it, and I have difficulty remembering the plot,and cannot for the life of me remember the faces of the actors. Anyone who gave this above 1 star should be ashamed of themselves.

On another note, this seems to be part of Amazon's disturbing trend of releasing straight-to-dvd quality movies for far more than the cost of a rental. $5 for this tripe was a plain ripoff. Even though $5 is meaningless in the long run, it might not be for some of us.

5357957,1,B009NRQU50,"An incomprehensible mess of a movie lacking suspense or any effective scary scenes, ""The Apparition"" looks and plays like a first year film student's project (and that's being generous).

SPOILERS:

Kelly (Ashley Green) and Ben (Sebastian Stan)find themselves haunted by a creature released as part of an experiment that Ben participated in when he was in college with Patrick (Tom Felton). It seems that Patrick continued the experiment after Ben cut off all contact with him. The creature manifests itself in Kelly's house as black mold, what looks like a black wasp's nest and the creature appearing as a woman at one point.

Unfortunately, the story is so poorly told that it's almost like the film is a series of disconnected ""scare"" scenes with a story tacked on after the fact. Good horror films require rules that explain what and why is occurring so we can understand the motivation of the creature or, at the very least, explain the attacks on those in the film. None of this occurs because writer/director Todd Lincoln can't tell a coherent story to save his life. Running a slight 82 minutes including the credits, the film has little in the way of story to hang the horror set pieces of the film on.

Perhaps there was the film went through signficant re-editing but what we are served here makes little sense and the story generates so little tension that it's like watching a bad SyFy original movie. Even the actors can't generate any level of interest in the material. Actor Felton from the Harry Potter films has little more than a glorified cameo in the movie and that's probably because he realized what a bad movie he had stumbled into.

END OF SPOILERS:

The Blu-ray looks decent although the image quality is so soft that it really doesn't justify an HD transfer nor HD viewing.

The audio sounds quite good with a nice 5.1 mix that makes good use of the format with directional sound effects as well as crystal clear dialogue.

The special features are as slight as the film. We get four featurettes that run under 30 minutes. The first features the cast and members of the crew discussing the film. The second focuses on ghost consultant Joshua P. Warren. The third and fourth feature Warren discussing Asheville, North Carolina the most ""haunted"" city in the U.S. and the latter is a recreation of the experiment from the beginning set in 1973 where a group of ghost hunters try to conjure the spirit of one of their deceased members named Charles. Needless to say, nothing happens although a brief text at the conclusion claims that ""something"" was released. Ho hum.

If I could give ""The Apparition"" no stars I would--it's inept filmmaking at its worst with an interesting set up that isn't followed up on, little character development, suspense and, with the exception of one sequence, a series of inept scare scenes.",1357344000,4,2846,4.791836734693877

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

The plot device of students conducting an experiment that opens a doorway to another dimension is just so lame and it's been done before.  It was done in Pulse and it wasn't even that interesting in that movie.  Oh if you're looking to see how the whole tagline of the movie, ""Once you believe, you die"" comes into play, it's never explained and it doesn't play a role in this film.

This movie wasn't scary at all.  It was just a bunch of flickering lights, some mold on the walls, a broken doll, and once in a while some shadows moving in the background.  There aren't even any jump scares in this movie to even TRY to make it scary.  The movie also relies too heavily on the main actress, Ashley Greene, prancing around in her underwear or a bikini or whatever the hell that thing was that she was wearing.

The ""ghost's"" motivation is very poorly explained, just that it wants to be alive.  Okay that's the motivation for every single ghost in every single ghost movie ever made, even Casper the Friendly Ghost had that as his motivation!

On top of all that at one point the main actress, (I can't even remember the character's name because she was so boring and one-dimensional), is in a room with the ghost on the floor on it's hands and knees looking up at her and she's holding a HAMMER in her hand.  Okay so why doesn't she just smash the thing in the head with the hammer and try to kill it?  I mean that's what I'd do if something creepy showed up in my house and it's intentions were unknown to me.  But no, she does what every other stupid female character does in these paranormal activity knock-off movies does.  She yells for the help of a big strong man to come to her rescue.

At the end of the movie we don't even really know what happens.  Is she in the real world?  Is she in the ghost world?  Is she dead?  Is she possessed?  We don't know.  I know some film-makers like to leave it up to the audience to come to the conclusion of what happened by leaving the ending open like that, but it's over used these days.  I need something more solid and something that tells me what happened.

The main reason for me although there are several, would be the way they try to add a little something here or there that's been done a thousand times before.
In order to be original or even remotely entertaining is to avoid what's already been done and doing a new take on an old concept.
Also having a clue as to where the story is going would of probably helped a little and not being one the most predictable movies out there is another blunder one must avoid to make any kind of stand out from the quagmire of films like this.
Also the run time was a little short and I think making a little longer and adding backstory to anything might of helped a little too.
But alas as you watch the movie you tend to know where it's going because it's got nowhere else to go and so you're just sitting there waiting for the inevitable ending.
Not even an attempt at being original and really more confusing then it should of been.

5357976,2,B009NRQU50,"I saw this when it came out in theaters. I was really excited to see it, as it looked like something a little different from other horror movies. I thought the movie would chronicle the actual experiment that took place to bring the events into being. Instead it was a movie about.... nothing, really. Some suspenseful scenes here and there, but nothing noteworthy. The end of the movie held some promise, as one of the characters had collected bits and pieces of information about this apparition. however, because it was at the end of the movie, it can really serve no purpose for the plot or the development of the characters (which was also lacking, by the way).

It really seemed like the director was trying really hard to do something different; and I applaud them for their efforts, but they just weren't successful at it. Having a story about the origins of this apparition would have made a great addition to the plot, would have made things more sensible rather than getting the feeling that everyone is just sort of obliviously running around like chickens with their heads cut off. The basic concept of the apparition is a good one, and had a lot of potential; but that potential was just not realized during the making of this particular film. Hopefully someone else can take the concept and make it into something better in the future.

It certainly wasn't worth the $10 I paid to see it at the theater; but for some it might be an alright movie to spend $4 on to rent if you have nothing else to do for an afternoon or evening.

Oy.  Right off the bat, the film can't decide if it's a POV flick or straight narrative.  We start off with a title card saying the film we will watch is a 70's era ""lost footage"" film of a ghost experiment gone wrong, then a more modern version of the same thing (hard to know exactly because the film never tells us) where a girl is snatched into darkness by what I guess was a ghost, then we move forward a couple of years to see a douche and a hot girl living in a huge mansion in the desert.  This all happens in about 10 minutes, and there is no apparent link between any of the 3 time periods.  And no, there is no reference back to the title card which said it would be a movie set in the 70's.  One of the worst beginnings to a movie of all the times.  I mean, MANOS THE HANDS OF FATE bad.

Like all films which have tried to combine the POV stylings of THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT with old fashioned film making (good lighting, dollyshots, cranes, etc), THE APPARITION super fails.  Neither style is scary in the slightest as executed in this junk heap, and while the film mostly settles on straight narrative, by the time it does you just don't care.  CHERNOBYL DIARIES actually scarier and more effective using this style, and that saying something because that movie crapped the bed.

Speaking of crap, it cost Silver/Time Warner $17 mil to make this piece of poo, so it will never have the indie charm and re-watchability of an Ed Wood movie or BIRDEMIC.  Nope - this is just a big stinking waste of money and time.  The music is God awful and while the editors try to save it (in fact, I think the whole first ten minutes was done from re-shoots and lots o re-editing), but it's so heavily cut in a failed attempt to be stylized that simply becomes laughable.

Think GHOSTBUSTERS meets PARANORMAL ACTIVITY but without any laughs or scares.  Or anything.  It's a like a 14 year wrote it, forgot about it, then found again after he graduated film school and made it as is.  Just about the least scary film you'll ever see (equal in it's awfulness to the dreadful remake of SOMEONE'S WATCHING ME).  It's a little like FLATLINERS but with a much dumber script and ZERO actual style.

The only redeeming quality about the film is Ashley Greene as Kelly.  She's like the pretty version of Kristen Stewart that can act a little... but certainly not enough to actually save THE CRAPARITION.

After 3 college friends get together to prove the existence of ghosts something strange happens. They decide that it didn't work and the three move on. Kelly (Greene) and Ben (Stan) are starting their life in their new home when the notice strange happenings. Nothing major but just things that make them think. When the events start to happen more and more they wonder what is going on. When an old friend tells Ben about an accident the couple realize they are in more danger then they thought. This is a hard movie to review. The first 15 minutes is pretty freaky. The next 45 minutes keeps you on the edge of your seat because you are waiting for something big to happen. The ending is OK but by the end it starts to run out of steam and was hard for me to keep interested all the way through. The movie was more psychological horror and not gory at all so that was kind of nice to see something different, but the movie ended up dragging too much for the end to have the impact I think it wanted.

5358004,4,B009NRQU50,"This is a good simple ghost story that the teens can watch. The film starts out with a seance in 1973. It then abruptly switches to the present where a ""scientific seance experiment"" is going to be performed. The crew wires up their heads in order to intensify the energy field for the entity to pass through. Things don't go that well for Patrick (Tom Felton, Draco from ""Harry Potter"") and his crew as something has happened.

The film jumps again to Ben (Sebastian Stan) who was part of the experiment and Kelly (Ashley Greene, Alice from ""Twilight"" ) one of the world's worse house sitters. Their house number is ""2812"" which flashes for a moment. It adds up to 13, although we really don't need a premonition of things to come. Like a good ghost story the odd events in the home build up slow until they reach a boiling point at which time my cat jumps on me.

I enjoyed the build up. I also liked the way they integrated the ""found footage"" into the film and didn't rely strictly on it. Thank you Todd Lincoln. Ashley Kelly, who was allowed to act in ""Twilight"" gives us a good performance in this one in spite of Sebastian Stan being unconvincing in his part. As the lead actor in this film, his character was written rather shallow, which was the downfall of the film. I didn't like the repeated narration near the end of the film and the ending needed to be tweaked.

Makes for a decent film for the sleepover, especially if they are sleeping outside in a tent.

5358011,3,B009NRQU50,"This is just another average ghost movie. I does has a few crazy moments, but nothing to memorable that is going to stick with you.

It seems to me that they kind of took parts of other ghost stories and stuck them together. It had a little bit of The Grudge (which you could probably tell that by the cover with the hands) mixed with a little Paranormal Activity (with setting up the security cameras), and a little bit of Mortuaty (with the black mold).

The ending is just like any other ghost movie ending, they think they have gotten rid of it and then all of a sudden it is back. This ending has been used so many times it is really getting old, time for writers to come up with something new and fresh.

Also you don't really get to see any of the ghost/spirit/demon whaterver the hell it is supposed to be. There are maybe 3 shots of a shadow.

We know from the opening scene that an experiment to validate the reality of ghosts went horribly wrong and we learn that the results of that experiment have somehow brought chaos to Greene's abode.

5358015,4,B009NRQU50,"I'm always interested in a good ghost story which takes a unique look at the subject of the supernatural. Although I wouldn't necessarily call ""The Apparition"" completely original, it's an interesting enough blend of different ideas that makes it engrossing. There's a little Asian horror ala ""The Grudge"" and ""Pulse,"" a very small pinch (thankfully) of ""Paranormal Activity,"" and a bit of ""Poltergeist"" to top it off.

The movie is stemmed in the idea that not only are there ghosts of actual dead people who haunt the living, but also evil entities that feed off people's beliefs. The more someone believes in a supernatural force, the stronger it gets. If it gets a foothold into someone, it can gain a greater entry into our physical world.

The students in ""The Apparition"" use scientific equipment to amplify their beliefs by 400 times. This unleashes a hellish force into our realm that wants to stay here permanently. One of the students (Sebastian Stan) chooses to leave his research behind and move on with his life. He soon finds this to be more difficult than he imagined when the entity starts wreaking havoc on his girlfriend (Ashley Greene) and new house.

I wholeheartedly agree with the idea of spirits being attached to people and not places. That's one thing that really fascinated me about this movie. It's not the typical film where a presence is affixed to the house and the tenants have to get away. These people try to escape by leaving the house and find the entity follows them no matter where they go.

One concept in the film I had a problem with is if you believe in the spirits they become stronger. Demons or evil entities have power whether we admit their existence or not. Kevin Spacey said it best in ""The Usual Suspects:"" ""The greatest trick the Devil ever pulled was convincing everyone he doesn't exist.""

The cast of ""The Apparition"" is an interesting mix of different talents. Ashley Green (""The Twilight Saga"") takes on the role of Girlfriend Kelly. Sebastian Stan (Bucky in ""Captain America: The First Avenger"") plays her boyfriend, Ben, with a sinister past. Tom Felton (Draco Malfoy in the ""Harry Potter"" movies) portrays the scientist trying to find a way to capture the spirit and keep it from entering the human world.

The audio and video quality of the Blu-ray release looks wonderful. The picture is clean and, although most of the movie is dark, it's visually easy on the eyes. The 5.1 surround sound mix helps all the creepy bangs and bumps in the night to be well-distributed throughout a home theater setting.

The extra features have very little to do with the actual movie. They're mostly made up of featurettes in which real life ghost hunter Joshua P. Warren investigates a couple of haunted spots and then tries to re-create the experiment that goes wrong in the film. ""'The Apparition:' A Cinematic Specter"" is a short behind-the-scenes look at what the cast thought about the experiment that serves as the catalyst for the entire film.

""The Apparition"" on Blu-ray isn't the greatest supernatural thriller you'll ever see. However, it gets extra points for blending together some different takes on the haunted house genre we haven't seen mashed together yet. It will definitely keep some viewers on edge if you hear strange noises in your house when you go to bed.",1353974400,25,3325,4.841549295774648
5358016,1,B009NRQU50,This movie was just horrible. Never jumped out of my seat...not the slightest bit scary!!! Waste of money and time! Does not deserve this single star.,1353974400,4,150,4.8076923076923075
5358017,3,B009NRQU50,"The film is about this college kids who perform an experiment that was already done years before that tried to prove the existence of supernatural entities, they were succesfull but at the same time one of the integrants looses his girlfriend who was also taking part. So in the end they forgot about the incident and moved along with their lives. But months later a couple starts being haunted by an apparition...
So the film is completly nule in terms of originality: it borrows elements from insidious, paranormal activity, the devil inside, pulse, the entity, the grudge, and poltergeist. This is in some way a letdown, but even with that, the film managed to be scary in 3-5 parts and also acomplished the goal of making viewers stay at the edge of their seat through the entire movie. The ending was very creepy too... The acting was not the best, but nowadays it's hard to find a movie with really good acting right? Another issue that really made me mad was the fact that the film had the tagline ""once you believe, you die"" but this theory was barely touched in the entire movie.. so the trailer kinda let you believe wrong facts about the movie.
Overall, the film was pretty suspensfull and entertaining to watch as a popcorn flick, although the marketing was a failure, and the films offers nothing original at all, just your typical ""i've seen it before"" ghost movie done right.
