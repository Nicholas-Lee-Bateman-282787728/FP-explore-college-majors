1340937,4,B00004L8IO,"There is an interesting pattern to the episodes collected on Volume 10 of ""The Twilight Zone"" DVD series since the third episode essentially merges the first two together.  But the key element here is obviously Time Travel.  ""The Last Flight,"" written by Richard Matheson, was sold to ""The Twilight Zone"" on the strength of a simple idea: a World War I pilot lands at a modern airbase.  The pilot is Flight Lt. Decker (Kenneth Haigh), who fled during a dogfight, leaving his best friend surrounded by enemy fighters, doomed to die.  After flying through a strange white cloud, similar to the Matheson employed in ""The Incredible Shrinking Man"" one would assume, Decker lands at a modern day American air field in France (you have to pretend we had them).  There Decker learns that he might have a chance to redeem himself and more importantly, a reason to do so.  ""Once Upon a Time,"" also written by Matheson is a rare opportunity for outright slapstick in the Zone.  The show features the great silent comedian Buster Keaton as janitor Woodrow Mulligan.  Disgusted with the fast paced and high priced society of 1890, Woodrow steals a ""time helmet"" from the inventor who employs him, and travels to 1962.  Of course, he is in for quite a bit of future shock.  The 1890 sequences are down in silent fashion, with cards instead of dialogue, but the humor is trite rather than funny.  Keaton is fine, but the gags are second-rate at best, which is really a surprise since the episode was directed by Norman Z. McLeod, who directed the Marx Brothers films ""Horse Feathers"" and ""Monkey Business.""  This is just one of those cases were major talents come together and produce a small pop instead of a big bang.
Cliff Robertson stars as Christian Horn, traveling to a new life in California in 1847 in ""A Hundred Yards Over the Rim,"" written by Rod Serling.  Similar to ""The Last Flight,"" this episode hinges on a pivotal image: while searching for water and food for his dying son, Horn walks ""over the rim"" to discover a paved highway, telephone poles, trucks and a diner.  However, the conclusion of this episode ends up paralleling ""The Last Flight"" way too much to avoid eye brow raising.  Still, the performance of Robertson makes this one work on its own terms.  Finally, ""The Trouble With Templeton,"" written by E. Jack Neuman, features Brian Aherne as Booth Templeton, an aging actor who longs for the happy days in the Twenties when his wife as still alive.  Late for a rehersal of a play he finds himself back in 1927.  Finding his wife Laura (Pippa Scott) alive at a local speakeasy he is stunned to find that while she is as beautiful as he remembers her, she is a vulgar little flirt.  His perfect memories destroyed, he returns to the present at which point he makes a rather stunning discovery.  I have a special fondness for this episode because I did not see the twist coming.  Sydney Pollack plays Willis, the young director who is not happy with Templeton's commitment to his craft.  This was Neuman's only Zone script, although he did write/produce several notable television series including ""Dr. Kildare,"" ""Mr. Novak"" and ""Police Story.""  This is an above average collection of ""Twilight Zone"" episodes helped alone by the thematic unity of the quartet of stories.",1007769600,12,3281,4.757950530035336
1340938,4,B00004L8IO,"Traveling to the future and the past is the common element in these four episodes for Volume 10 of ""The Twilight Zone"" DVD series.  ""The Last Flight,"" written by Richard Matheson, finds Lt. Decker (Kenneth Haigh) deserting his best friend during a World War I dog fight only to fly through a strange cloud and end up on an American air base in France ""today,"" where he will learn what happened to the man he left behind.  ""Once Upon a Time"" is also written by Matheson, but the joy here is that janitor Woodrow Mulligan is played by the legendary Buster Keaton, who uses a time helmet invented by Professor Gilbert (Milton Parsons) in 1890 to visit the utopia of 1962.  This episode is pure slapstick and Norman McLeod, director of ""Topper"" and a couple of Marx Brothers flicks, was brought in to do the honors.  Perhaps the least serious episode of the Zone ever, but who cares?  THIS IS BUSTER KEATON!
Rod Serling's ""A Hundred Yards Over the Rim"" tells the tale of Christian Horn (Cliff Robertson), traveling with his wife and child to California in 1847.  Trying to find help for his dying son, Horn walks over the rim of a hill and discovers a paved highway, trucks and a diner, where he might get help if the people there did not think he was crazy.  ""The Trouble with Templeton"" by E. Jack Neuman stars Brian Aherne as Booth Templeton, an actor who years for the old days and who is given a chance to revisit 1927, where he finds his memories of his beloved wife Laura (Pippa Scott) are not as accurate as he had thought.  Sydney Pollack (director of ""Tootsie"" and more) plays the abrasive young stage director in this episode.  Even with the presence of Keaton, there are no certifiable classics on this particular disc, but they are certainly all solid efforts and the time travel theme provides a nice theme.",990662400,,1817,4.549079754601227
1340939,3,B00004L8IO,"Tickles the taste buds of mans fascination with time travel.  ""The Last Flight"" flies through with a cowardly WWI psuedo flying ace who finds himself grounded in the wrong time.  After flying through a ""mysterious"" cloud to avoid confrontation with the enemy our pilot finds himself landing at a modern U.S air base (circa1960) after abandoning a fellow flyboy.  Its not until things begin to thicken that our pilot realizes his purpose of returning to the sky  to sacrifice himself for the better of man.  If it were not for the heroics of ""The Last Flight"" and ""A Hundred Yards Over the Rim"" this would not be worth buying. The other two were watered down yet amusing to enough to watch by principle alone.  The idea of bending time for good or bad is always entertaining and flat out scary.  Volume ten touches on a little of both.",978739200,3,834,4.594594594594595

7920497,4,B00004L8IO,"Volume 10 in the series of ""Twilight Zone"" DVDs includes in all four episodes a common theme that was looked at many times during the run of the show. Time traveling. Whether going forward or backwards in time it was always an interesting look at how someone would respond suddenly to being placed in a different place and time from the current time they are from. In all four cases for the main characters in the episodes on this disc find themselves in such a predicament. In three of the stories they go forward in time and in the other backwards. But in every case they are still in the ""Twilight Zone"".

In the first story a WWI pilot while in the middle of a dog fight suddenly flies through a cloud and over 40 plus years into the future titled ""The Last Flight"". Landing on a U. S. airbase located in France Flight Lt. Decker , played by Kenneth Haigh, is surprised to see the modern fighter jets when he lands and even more so when he finds out that the year is 1960. Of course everyone at the airbase is equally surprised to see a vintage WWI airplane landing on their airstrip and of course questions are brought up as to why this person and his plane are on the base and certainly don't believe the pilot and his plane are from the first world war. What is revealed causes Decker to realize he has to get back to where he came from. A pretty decent episode.

""Once Upon A Time"" is one of those rare humorous episodes that stars the legendary Buster Keaton. He plays a janitor name Woodrow Mulligan who lives in 1890 and is frustrated by the fast pace of light and longs for a time where things are easier and not so noisy. He steals a time helmet from a scientist he works for to go forward in time only to find out that the grass isn't always greener on the other side of the time line. Keaton of course was known as one of the greatest comedians during the silent movie era and during the portions of the story that takes place in 1890 it is presented as a silent movie right down to the cards with the dialog written on it. Of course when the story takes place during the modern era everyone speaks their lines. It is not a great episode for ""Twilight Zone"" but the comedy is decent with a little slapstick thrown in and hey you got Buster Keaton starring in it!

Number 3 of the episodes is my favorite on the disc starring Cliff Robertson titled  ""A Hundred Yards Over the Rim"". In the story Robertson is the leader of a wagon train heading across the desert to California during the 1850s. They are short on food and water and to top things off Robertson's son is ill and in need of medicine. To far away to go either forward or back Robertson sets out to a rim off in the distance to see if he can find any water or food. What he finds of course is the ""Twilight Zone"" and modern day New Mexico with a strange looking road and even stranger looking modes of transportation. What he will discovers along the way will be a valuable as the medicine he finds for his son. I would rate this one of the best episodes of the Zone

 ""The Trouble with Templeton"" is the last offering on this DVD and stars Brian Ahern as Booth Templeton, an aging actor who misses his late wife and the old days when he was one of the top actors around. He has a chance to star in a new play that could revive his career but he is too much stuck in the past to be able to move forward until a trip back in time within the ""Twilight Zone"" reveals much to him. I would rate this a good episode.

All in all not a bad volume to have for the big ""Twilight Zone"" fan. Without the episode ""A Hundred Yards Over The Rim"" on it I would rate this volume only three stars but with that episode a part of this disc it pushes up to four stars.",1390867200,,3724,4.163888888888889
7920498,5,B00004L8IO,"THE TROUBLE WITH TEMPLETON is a very sentimental and endearing episode written by E. Jack Neuman and directed by Buzz Kulik. Veteran actor Brian Aherne is given a chance to see earlier times, happier times, but memory and truth are not always one and the same. I love this simple episode. Brian Aherne was always such a dignified actor with a flair for lighting up the screen with his contagiously likable presence. The casting of Brian Aherne here was a brilliantly one. As a viewer, one can really relate to the years and memories that this great actor and the character he plays here must have experienced. Uniquely in this role, given his great performance here, Brian Aherne elevates this episode beyond the mundane. ONCE UPON A TIME written by Richard Matheson and directed by Norman Z. McLeod featuring Buster Keaton, Stanley Adams, Gil Lamb, James Flavin, Michael Ross, Milton Parsons, George E. Stone, Warren Parker is a sentimental time traveling tale befitting to Buster Keaton. In essence, it is a tribute to Keaton and his silent films. It too is a good one.",1380585600,,1071,4.826086956521739
