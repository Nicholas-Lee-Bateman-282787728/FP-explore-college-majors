8127032,2,B000FUIUFC,"If you know the basics about an SLR, this video doesn't help.  The talks about ISO all most exclusively and touches on shutter speed.  He totally ignores aperture. It gets 2 stars only because he does teach something and it is not a total waste.  Again the video is for a person who knows almost nothing about photography and doesn't mind going on youtube and browsing tutorials on aperture.
I wouldn't buy this again.",1385856000,2,418,4.621621621621622

8127034,5,B000FUIUFC,"This DVD is excellent for the more visual learners. Jim walks the viewer through what not to do. He shows the difference between ordinary and extraordinary shots. I wish that I had this DVD when my older children were young. I would have so many more photographic treasures.

Thanks Jim",1152230400,,286,4.72
8127035,5,B000FUIUFC,"My wife is a photographer doing children's portraits for many years now, and you might say I'm her assistant. But I also enjoy doing a lot of photography myself. No matter how skilled you are, and how long you've been actively ""in the business of photography"" you can always pick up a tip, or a fresh idea or two, and this DVD will do just that. If you are new to photographing kids, you will find this DVD to be a wealth of extremely useful information. Remember, anyone can point a camera and take a snapshot, but if you want a photograph that will tell a story, and one that you will cherish for a lifetime, then you should really consider buying this DVD.",1152230400,,659,4.32258064516129
