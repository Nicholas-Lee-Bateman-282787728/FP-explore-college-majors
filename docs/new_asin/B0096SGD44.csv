5274469,5,B0096SGD44,"What a wonderful resource both for new moms and for anyone who helps breastfeeding mothers.  Most videos with this quality and this up-to-date information sell for much more, so it is a real bargain at under $20.  I help breastfeeding moms and it is my go-to resource for pregnant and new moms.",1353024000,2,294,4.634615384615385
5274470,5,B0096SGD44,"This dvd is awesome! It provided me with so much information that I needed as a new mother, and helped me feel comfortable with breastfeeding.",1352332800,2,142,4.72
5274471,5,B0096SGD44,"As an international board certified lactation consultant, I'm a bit of a connoisseur of breastfeeding videos.  This one is among the top of my list.  It gives parents excellent up-to-date breastfeeding information and guidance.  This is a great resource for new moms and breastfeeding counselors.",1349481600,5,296,5.533333333333333
5274472,5,B0096SGD44,"I am a new mom to a four month old who is exclusively breastfed with the help of this video! I am also a certified nurse midwife for the past 13 years and this DVD is given to each of my patients at their 30 week visits because its so important for a woman to have a simple ""Go-To"" preparation video. I am so thankful that a video like this was made... It is so easy to get caught up in the worries that Breastfeeding will be difficult, but watch this DVD and see that helpful hints and problem solving advice will make it all fall into place!",1348531200,5,543,4.037037037037037
5274473,5,B0096SGD44,"Over the years I've purchased several different videos about breastfeeding.  This one is by far the best value for your dollar!  It is packed with solid information about the benefits of breastfeeding and details about getting breastfeeding off to a good start. ""Breastfeeding: A Guide for Success"" is the best baby present I know of.  I'd love to give one to every pregnant woman I see!",1348272000,4,387,4.833333333333333
5274474,1,B0096SGD44,"It was a very disappointing DVD, I didn't learn anything and it was an old DVD on top of it. After delivery, a lactation consultant comes and shows you how to breast feed and it is more than enough ! No need to buy this DVD, a waste of money . On the other hand there are lots of great book about the benefits of breast feeding which are good .",1377907200,,344,3.859154929577465
5274475,5,B0096SGD44,"Breastfeeding: A Guide to Success is by far the BEST breastfeeding video I've ever seen for new mothers. I've worked in maternity for over 25 years, had prior experience as a LC, and worked with many mothers on the basics of breastfeeding...But to have it ALL available in a ""take home"" DVD to review as many times as possible is fabulous! I will definitely recommend to ALL my moms. This DVD should really be promoted prenatally for all mothers. What a way to encourage success!",1377043200,,479,4.647058823529412
5274476,5,B0096SGD44,"As a breastfeeding mom and registered dietitian I found this video helpful, informative and interesting.

It covers a wide aray of topics including breastfeeding positions, tips for the first feeding, and frequently asked questions.

My favorite parts were the interviews with the moms.  I loved hearing their trials and successes, it was very encouraging.

I would recommend this video to any mom-to-be or to a medical professional seeking to provide women with a solid foundation for breastfeeding.",1377043200,,500,5.454545454545454
5274477,5,B0096SGD44,Loving this...perfect timing for a niece that is facing these situations and will love the info... Great to find this when its important to all new mums and dads...to share so the first few days of your new child is calm and in order...not worrisom..thank you...francy,1376611200,,268,4.8478260869565215

5274479,5,B0096SGD44,"I have given this DVD to several of my friends when they were expecting. This informative and heartwarming video, helps prepare expectant parents and provide excellent guidance for the family.",1376611200,,192,5.433333333333334
5274480,5,B0096SGD44,"I have used this excellent video to teach my nursing students the basics, the benefits, and the tools needed to educate ourselves and our communities about the health gains rendered from breastfeeding.

The video is engaging and well presented, and covers the topic in a professional and thorough manner.",1376611200,,304,5.204081632653061
5274481,5,B0096SGD44,What a wonderfully produced instructional video that contains clear and accurate information about breastfeeding. I strongly encourage any parents to purchase this DVD and use it as your guide to breastfeeding!,1376265600,,210,5.806451612903226
5274482,5,B0096SGD44,I loved the spanish version of the DVD I understand better in spanish and the spanish was easy to understand. I recommend this DVD for any spanish speaking client.  Thank you  for making it simple for me to understand.,1376265600,,218,4.564102564102564
5274483,5,B0096SGD44,"As an IBCLC (International Board Certified Lactation Consultant), this is my absolute favorite video to recommend to new and expectant mothers.  The beginning 30 minute video covers so many of the basics every mom should know, and also has lots of great footage of many diverse mothers and their babies actually breastfeeding.  The information is all accurate and evidence based.  After the main video, there is approximately another 30 minutes of frequently asked questions that are easy to navigate and cover many common (and not so common) situations.  This video would be a great find for $100, but for under $20, it's a must have!",1366416000,3,635,5.019047619047619
8536973,5,B0096SGD44,"This is a great, comprehensive guide to breastfeeding!",1492646400,,54,5.875
8536974,4,B0096SGD44,"I had missed my breastfeeding class and while this doesnt replace it, it helped me learn some things and make me more at ease. Indo recommend it for anyone who wants some extra knowledge!",1444521600,,187,4.529411764705882
8536975,5,B0096SGD44,"This DVD would be a great addition to any baby registry. There are many couples who would both enjoy this and find it useful, perhaps much more than a book. It covers all the information I would wish to share with clients, as an IBCLC (International Board Certified Lactation Consulant). It can be viewed in parts, or from start to finish. The FAQ covers all the questions I am asked regularly. It is a great source for both good information and encouragement. A picture is worth a thousand words, and there are so many spots where the DVD could be stopped, and replayed, to see just exactly how to latch, or how to nurse in a  ""laid back"". . This DVD is not just to watch once, but to refer to and watch sections of interest, over and over. Many women unfortunately do NOT have the care of a lactation consultant, and may not even have a breastfeeding support group near them. Breastfeeding: A Guide to Success will be especially valuable to those women.
Especially valuable is the portrayal of he important part fathers play in breastfeeding success. It warmed my heart to see the couples working together, and Dads wearing their babies. It is clear that breastfeeding does not shut Dads out, but gives them the opportunity to parent in more ways than just feeding.",1406073600,,1267,4.606194690265487
8536976,4,B0096SGD44,The information in the video was accurate and current.  The FAQ at the end of the film went on for way too long.  Film became tedious.  FAQ should be made optional watching.,1395619200,,173,4.34375
8536977,2,B0096SGD44,"I understand that breastfeeding can be difficult in the first few weeks but once you get a handle on it, it can really pay off. I bought this DVD with the hope that a video would be more helpful than a book in demonstrating a proper latch, etc and it does do that. However, much of the video is wasted in Mom Testimonials about how great breastfeeding is, etc instead of going into more detail about the ACT of breastfeeding. There are entire books written about breastfeeding and for a one hour video it barely scratches the surface. I suspect a good breast feeding book plus some YouTube videos would yield more information for the money.",1394150400,3,640,4.525862068965517
8536978,5,B0096SGD44,My wife was given this DVD by a peer counselor and we watched it together to prepare for having our first baby together. It answered some of the concerns I had about my wife breastfeeding. I feel like it was very helpful and she did great with nursing.,1386892800,,252,4.270833333333333
8536979,5,B0096SGD44,"I loved this DVD! It helped me with breastfeeding when I had problems with my 2nd child and again when my 3rd was in the NICU. All the information was very helpful. You think when you have successfully breastfed one child that it will always be the same, but when I had my 2nd and 3rd we ran into problems. I share this dvd with every mom I meet who wants to breastfeed and be successful!! I love how it addresses common problems and questions",1386892800,,443,4.223529411764706
8536980,5,B0096SGD44,I use this for teaching my breastfeeding class. Great video. Love how it shows how to latch baby on. Very informative. Hope they come out with an updated version. Been using this video for last 3 yrs,1386547200,2,199,4.405405405405405
8536981,5,B0096SGD44,"I watched this video as a pregnant mother in preparation for breastfeeding for the first time, and then again in the first days after delivering my baby when I was new to breastfeeding.  I had never seen a woman breastfeeding before (how sad!) so there was a lot I was unsure of with breastfeeding.  This video helped me learn about what is normal and answered questions I had.  It was a wonderful introduction for me to breastfeeding.  I highly recommend it!",1380844800,,459,4.62962962962963
8536982,5,B0096SGD44,"As a new mom, this dvd helped me prepare with what to expect while breastfeeding. I am very thankful I bought this dvd. It has everything you need to know to get started breastfeeding. I highly recommend it to any new or expectant mom!!!",1379376000,,237,4.409090909090909
