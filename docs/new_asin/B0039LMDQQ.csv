I recently ordered the Lanjie DVDs from [...] as I mentioned in the first post. I ordered them on May 14th., the order was sent out on May 24th and I received the DVDs on May 26th.. Sifu Daily apologized for the delay in shipping and kindly offered me a reduced price on my next order. Good customer service!

Production & Video Quality

In the middle 1980s I hired a video company to help me produce a videotape on the Fu Hok Sheung Ying Kuen form of Hung Gar Kung Fu. It sold very well in the U.S..
So, I have some experience in this field and the nightmare it can be to take on a project like this.

Martialskill's end product is very professional. From the DVD packaging to the content breakdown, everything far exceeds the DVDs I have purchased from other Mantis practitioners in the U.S., Taiwan, Hong Kong and Canada. Kevin Brazier is the only one I have found who puts out a similar quality video (Shaolin Eight Step Continuous Fist).

The video, sound, scene transitions, etc. are all professional quality.

Form Demonstration, Breakdown & Applications

First, I compared the demonstration of the Lanjie form to videos of other Qixing Tanglang practitioners found demonstrating this same form on YouTube and other video sites. Sifu Daily's performance is not only the best I have seen to date, but his ""flair"" in execution was quite inspiring.

Sifus Daily, Lopez and Brown each did an excellent demonstration of the traditional form. Sean Daily, the primary performer in the video, had a firm grasp of: cadence, speed and qixing tanglangquan's subtle power generation methods.

The form was broken down into five rows. Each row was taught step by step in a clear, precise manner. Footwork and power generation through the waist were constantly emphasized. The traditional names for the attacks were included in the instruction.
Each movement in the form was then demonstrated with a partner to show the common application used for self-defense.
One could choose to watch the step by step instruction of the movements, or watch a movement by movement application of the techniques separately.
Sifu Daily is an interesting speaker who was able to hold my attention. He explains complex comcepts in a simple way that I believe even a beginner could understand.

Summary

I would recommend this DVD set to any tanglangquan practitioner. Especially to qixing tanglangquan practitioners. If you like the beautiful aesthetics found in forms, its in there. If you like the practical applications found in forms, its in there. If you want a solid and clear explanation of tanglangquan theories, its in there.
I believe every penny I spent on these DVDs was a good investment in my own personal learning experience.",1275091200,9,2725,4.9021739130434785
8392099,5,B0039LMDQQ,"This DVD provides an excellent source for whoever wants to learn one of the most important forms of the 7 Stars Mantis System, Lan Jie Quan (or Intercepting Fist Boxing). The form is taught very accurately and precisely, using well made video images shown under different angles. Furthermore, a wide part of the DVD is focused on real fight applications. Even for people who already know this form, I would recommend it for reference purpose.",1267401600,4,442,4.906666666666666
