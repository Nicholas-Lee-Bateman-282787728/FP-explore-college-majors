8350313,5,B00242KDDQ,"To me the appeal of a collection like this is the animations themselves, so I do not understand the need to paste ""14 Hours Of Animated Films"" on the cover box. Now i'll be the first to tell ya that I haven't watch the whole set yet [I just received it yesterday] but I did look at the running times of each disc and i'm not seeing anything that's adding up to 14 hours here. That being said, this is still a great buy for anyone who digs 70's to early 80's animations. I don't know but it seems like animations from that era was less complicated and watching them even for the first time feels ""familiar"". Apparently, there is a hard to find popular early 80's version of ""Aladdin"" here, one I became aware of when  my sister bought the vhs back in the day. I did watch ANGEL an early anime series that ran from '79 to 1980 and it was good,no the whole series is not here just a couple of episodes. Finally, I think it's a great buy and i'm glad I bought it !&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fairy-Tale-Adventures/dp/B00242KDDQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fairy Tale Adventures</a>",1424736000,,1124,4.793814432989691
8350314,5,B00242KDDQ,"I have been looking for a particular animated version of Aladdin called Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp for years.  But try as I might, I couldn't find it.  There wasn't an online vendor in the world that appeared to have this wonderful movie.  I even bought a similar product as was burnt by something that was ""close but no cigar"".  But finally FINALLY this collection of Fairy Tale movies has reunited me with this classic from my childhood and I couldn't be happier!

I first saw this movie when I was a child watching YTV in Canada.  This version of the movie was actually pretty close to the Disney version; except it was different in a few fun ways.  The introduction, the characters, and the events of the story line are almost the same as in the Disney version except instead of Abu, Aladdin has a little kangaroo-mouse that hops around and lives on his shoulder; and instead of a flying-carpet, Aladdin gets a ring that contains a smaller Genie with less power than the Genie of the lamp and he has to use his wits to pit the less powerful Genie against the Genie of the lamp to beat the Jafar character.  These differences were small, but I really enjoyed the uniqueness of this version; no singing either (which can be seen as either a plus or a minus).  I actually don't remember a lot of the film and am very excited to see and remember it.

The rest of the films in the DVD collection are quite amazing too.  There is a wide variety of animation styles on a variety of great childrens classics from Sinbad to the Three Musketeers, and more than one version of Alice in Wonderland.  I highly recommend the set to expose children to a wide variety of classic stories and to animation enthusiasts who wish to view a wide variety of highly imaginative, classic styles.",1356134400,2,1778,4.487577639751553
