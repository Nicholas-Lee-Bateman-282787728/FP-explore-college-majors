That is all I will tell you so as not to spoil the fun. To bad the whole series is not on DVD. As popular as it was I am quite certain it would sell well to the people that originally watched it, and those that did not that like private eye TV shows or movies.",1037577600,,399,3.819277108433735
7839271,3,6303128998,Magnum pi was for me one of the best programs on television in the 1980's. I remember seeing this particular episode not too long ago on t.v and i  liked the fact it took place out of the Hawiil setting into London. All i  remeber this was a fast paced episode like all the other ones and the most  memorable as well.,967593600,4,317,4.080645161290323
7839272,5,6303128998,"As with all of the Magnum shows, this was another great one. I actually believe it is one of my favorites. I would love to see a lot more of the shows available for sale. Actually I would like to have a set of all the  shows made.",961804800,7,230,3.7916666666666665
