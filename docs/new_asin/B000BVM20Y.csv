8093121,5,B000BVM20Y,"This DVD is a great easy-to-follow instructional program that shows you how to use everyday objects as magical props to impress your friends and family. I found out about this DVD after viewing an episode of Criss Angel's Mindfreak on A&E last Thursday, featuring Chadakazam. He become my inspiration.....

The instructor is no ordinary magician. After learning he had cancer in 1991, 3-year-old Chad Juros spent a lot of time in the hospital with his father, who taught him everything he knew about sleight-of-hand tricks. Now cancer free, Chadakazam performs around the country -- even on the White House lawn!",1165795200,5,612,5.12

1) Card tricks -including 8 different card tricks such as: The Impassible, Mystery card trick, the deck Talks, and my favorite, Traveling card.
2) Money tricks -including 5 effective tricks with money such as; The French Drop, Coin Matrix, Quarter through table and more
3) Everyday Objects -tricks with easy to find things around the house such as napkins, pens, rubber bands and more (7 tricks)
4) Rope Magic - includes 5 tricks such as Knot Off Rope, Cut and Restore rope, Shortening & Lengthening, Instantly One...

The DVD has interactive menu, which without hassle allows you to go to the trick you like the most and practice it over and over.
The instructor is young yet speaks intelligently, and the way he explains the tricks are done makes you want to learn them all.
I find this DVD very entertaining and highly recommend it to all!

There is an opening that just goes on and on forever, with tricks that he never explaines in the DVD, but it gives you an idea of how good he is at parlor-trick type magic.

Eveything is well explained, and easy to follow. It's well worth the money for the card tricks I learned here, and it's a good start for anyone who wants to get their feet wet in the world of magic.  My first magic DVDs were this, and Magic Frank. Both are great for kids, and fun to use on kids, as well as the less critical adults. After you step up from these DVDs check out Penguin and ellusionist for the more advanced magic that can really WOW anyone.",1157673600,16,858,4.089285714285714
