5325495,5,B009GGWWL4,"Yep, I'm one of the 'purists' and anyone that knows me knows THIS is the ultimate gift after 30 years of waiting! :-) Indeed, ordering from Cagneyandlacey dot com gets you a 'complete' set which, I believe, is the reason anyone awaiting any 'full series' would want/order.  Who really knows how many 'limited edition' sets are out there and, hopefully, down the road, more will surface for the masses who may have missed out.  I am positively giddy with excitement waiting for it to show up at my front door.  I'm not reviewing the contents; I'm reviewing the excitement.  A huge thank you to all involved for bringing this 'full series' to our living rooms once again!  To see this series from pilot movie to final 'Menopause' movie, is something that goes right next to my complete 'Friends' collection, and, like it, will be viewed over and over and over!  -Update upon receiving it-  WOW WOW WOW!  Everything I wanted it to be and more!  Crisp, clean and includes everything I would want.  If you loved the show, then being without the original pilot movie or Meg Foster episodes would be like choosing to be missing an arm --- sure, you could probably live without it BUT WHY WOULD YOU??? :-)  Complete means Complete and that's what you want proudly displayed - a COMPLETE set!  I love Amazon.com and am here for everything/anything I'm looking for, but for this ---- cagney and lacey dot com is the place to be...Mine arrived in exactly 7 days!  Best GIFT EVER!!!",1353801600,2,1470,4.651162790697675
5325496,1,B009GGWWL4,"The Real Complete Series, with the episodes with Meg Foster is CHEAPER than this FAKE version. Even though you have to pay for shipping.",1353628800,5,136,4.708333333333333
5325497,4,B009GGWWL4,"I know that many C&L fans are awaiting reviews of both the ""Standard"" version of this set (32 discs, 119 episodes = 93+ hours!) and the Limited Edition Deluxe version (that adds 29 MORE hours - though 12 of those are the audiobook version of producer Barney Rosensweig's autobiography). For a thorough review of the sets, I'm guessing someone will need to spend 93 hours. That's four 24-hour days (!) or 122 hours (that's more than FIVE days) watching the contents. I'm guessing that the video company didn't expect most reviewers to do that so they created a ""sampler"" promo DVD for the Media that included ""The Producer's Picks"". This included:

The original TV movie with Loretta Swit as Cagney
The first episode of Season 1 of the series - with Meg Foster as Cagney
Six episodes from Season Two on: These were:
Heat
An Unusual Occurrence
Out of Control
Power
To Sir With Love - one of the slapstick episodes
Choices - the ""freedom of a woman to choose"" episode

And one of the ""Special Features"" on the Limited Edition Set - The 2011 British Film Institute's 30th Anniversary Screening - with Rosensweig, Gless and Daly being interviewed for an hour (with excerpts from episodes discussed.)

I sat through most of this ""sampler"" and that is the basis for this review. I say ""most"" because the screeners had an imprint noting it was for ""Screening Purposes Only"" in large print across the screen all the way through the episodes. Video companies often mark promo screeners with an imprint (to prevent bootlegging of course) but the imprint appears briefly every 10 minutes or so. That was not the case with the C&L DVD.

I know the first question fans want to know is: ""How is the video quality?"". Based on the Pilot and two episodes I watched I can say that - if this is the quality of the final product - it is ""acceptable. It doesn't appear that these were remastered and some scenes are dark. The show was broadcast before HD TV and so the screen ratio is that of Standard 4x3. I watched on a 35 year-old 27in standard TV and it filled the screen. If you have a wide-screen TV you will need to format it so that the image is correct and not stretched.

The BFI interview was interesting with lots of ""backstage"" stories for the three interviewees. This was recorded in Wide-screen aspect and the clips shown were much sharper than when I saw the full episode - even on the same TV - so I can't truly tell you if the images on the ""sampler"" were before any touch-up. One issue with the BFI piece is that it was primarily for the audience attending and was recorded ""live"" and the microphones used by the cast - especially the moderator (never named or introduced) were not at the right distance and there is lots of ""blasting"" and distortion. This, of course, doesn't stop you from hearing the information, but I wanted you to know what to expect.

I have given the set four stars because I did like the set but am assuming the transfer quality was what I saw. PLEASE take that into consideration when seeing my star rating. Of course for die-hard C&L fans this is a Five Star product.

Again, I was only able to ""sample"" the above noted parts of the ""complete set"". I'm sure that someone who has bought the full set will post their reviews after receiving their copies.

I'm sure that this will be a ""once in a lifetime"" release so TRUE C&L fans will probably get the set. I do have to admit that I watched many of the seasons on TV but more as a casual viewer who liked the ""social action"" plotlines.

I hope this review was both informative and helpful.

It's smartly written and acted and way above most of its contemporaries. The problem here is technical. These are very mediocre transfers to DVD, not nearly as good as in the Season 1 set I purchased earlier--not much better than VHS, in fact. I'm glad I got this fairly cheaply ($44), or I would have felt distinctly ripped off. It's OK for seeing the shows.

5325554,4,B009GGWWL4,"1. The episode guides for each season are embedded into the inner side of the DVD cover, not separately in a booklet. No one likes to take out the cover. ;)

2. The pre-Sharon Gless episodes are missing. Fortunately, I have them downloaded, but it would have been nice to have them on the DVDs as well.

Apart from that, YAY, finally! I only wish the box was available in Europe... needed a friend in the U.S. to send it to me. :-/",1392336000,4,431,4.180722891566265

5325557,4,B009GGWWL4,"I'm angry. Paid a lot of money for this long-awaited set, only to find there are no closed captioning or subtitles. I'm hearing impaired, so READING the dialog is important. Isn't there a federal-disabilities law requiring captioning? I think so. Even so, consider the age of your audience who watched Cagney and Lacey 30-yeas ago. There is no excuse for your lack of captioning, Orion Pictures! With today's voice-recognition software, captioning/subtitles are cost effective. I'm returning my set. I hope to be notified when you add CC/subtitles so I buy the set (again). As for the picture quality, I'm pleasantly surprised to find it very good, considering they are copies of the original films.",1387756800,3,699,5.140350877192983
5325558,5,B009GGWWL4,"I loved the show in the 80's, and now it's mine once again. Splindid show and well written and well acted.  Crime show, yes, but what a big heart this show had.  It's really a show about relationships, not just getting the bad guy.",1382227200,,231,4.2272727272727275

5325571,3,B009GGWWL4,"I love Cagney and Lacey. The series is wonderful with some of the best story lines and acting from the 1980s (and beyond). My husband gave me this DVD set for Christmas 2012, and I just today finished the last episode after watching the entire series for the last seven months. To my dismay, one episode would not play at all, and numerous others stop, halt, and skip. The low quality of this set is a bitter disappointment. I held my breath each time my favorite episodes came on for fear I wouldn't be able to see them in their entirety. If, like me, you love the show and can't get the episodes any other way, go for it, but be aware that you may have quality issues unless the issuing company has made significant changes.",1376784000,21,726,4.345588235294118
5325572,4,B009GGWWL4,"Cagney & Lacy was always one of my favorite TV shows, such that I often taped the broadcasts.  Obviously, time marches on, so when I noticed that Amazon had the Complete Series, I purchased the set for my own use even though it was somewhat expensive. It is surprising how modern the stories seem, even though much time has passed since the original broadcasts. At the same time it is interesting that they use dial phones and phone booths; drive big-boat cars without seat belts, and search for things in paper files. Non-the-less the human brain and personal frailties are still the same, and the episodes ring as true as ever. Certainly, these are better than some of the reality shows offered now.",1373846400,,701,4.699186991869919
5325573,4,B009GGWWL4,"Overall good. Some of the DVD's have technical issues which resulted in some episodes stoping midway then retuning to the start. Ultimately half the episode was missed.

Still enjoyable seeing the series again after so many years.",1371859200,,230,5.216216216216216
5325574,5,B009GGWWL4,"Through its initial run, I loved Cagney and Lacey.  Even as a high school and college student, I knew this was a great show.  Now, 30 years later, as a middle aged adult, I truly admire just how  extraordinary this program is/was.  The subject matter holds up.  The issues tackled in this series  continue to emerge today.  This is timeless story telling. Of course, the acting is superb.  Gless and Daly have set the bar.  The ensemble  creates a colorful, yet real cast of supporting characters.",1370476800,,497,4.674418604651163

Some episodes are poor quality video and others do not play at all.  You are better off paying slightly more and getting the limited edition.

5325578,5,B009GGWWL4,"Hands down.  If you did not see Tyne Daly and Sharon Gless in the 80's as Cagney and Lacey, you are missing out.

5325591,3,B009GGWWL4,"For the most part, I had thought that this was good, I liked it; BUT there was One { 1 } Eposoide in Particular that was Burned to the DVD in a Very BAD Way.  The Burning of this One { 1 } Particular Eposide was so Bad, that Almost if Not the Entier Eposoide was in my Opinion, Severely Distorted.  Whats really Unusual is that on ALL Three { Copies } that I had been Sent, they ALL were Severely Defective in the Exact Same Place.
  So that tells me that what ever Company that had Burned the Information on to these DVD's, had done something that they Weren't Supposed to have done.  Why do I say that, because if the Company that came out with the Entire Series, if they hadn't done anything Wrong, then why was Almost if not the Entire Eposoide in my Opinion Severely Distored in the Exact Same Place?
  All of the other Epossoides were just fine, there Wasn't Any Problems, so how come the Exact Same Probem of Distortion had Appeared on the Exact Same Eposoide with Every Set that I had recieved?  Another thing that I Didn't really like was, Almost Every Eposoide had left the Viewer Hanging; the viewer Never found Out what the end result had been.  Now this was the fault of the Writters, why the Writters would do this, is beyond me, and personnaly, I Don't like it when the Writters of Any Television Show and or Movie does this, but that's just me, I Can't Speak for anyone else, I can ONLY Speak for myself!",1361059200,,1420,4.268656716417911

I doubt anybody who loves this show needs a review. My comment here is really to wonder why good television shows take forever to be put on disc, as this one did. Judging Amy is still not out there except for season 1 and while I'm at it years later Bob Newhart, Rhoda, Becker, and Mad About You are still not complete. I've worked with rights at a high-level position in publiihing so I know what a pain rights can be but we keep after it. I hope the television folks do as well.",1360454400,2,683,4.213740458015267
5325593,5,B009GGWWL4,"The reviews I was reading about this item kept me waiting until the price went up from $95 to $135.50 so please people, don't hesitate and let this item get to $200 before you buy it because if you are a fan of Cagney and Lacey like I am you shouldnt hesitate.  The only thing true about the drawbacks is the fact that it does not have subtitles or captions for the hearing impaired like me; however, there are a number of really good expensive movies that don't so I didn't let that keep me from buying it.  The only thing that kept me hesitating is the fact that there was no listing of the episodes.  One review said it was somewhere in microprint but I assumed that it was not with the discs and therefore I would not be able to find my favorite episodes except by watching every disc one by one and writing down the episodes myself.  However that is not the case.  On the color cardboard that is wrapped around each case on the inside is listed the name of each and every episode and the disc on which you will find it.  So if you want to find, for instance the two part great, tear jerker episodes, in which Cagney loses her father and ends up an alcoholic, entitled Turn, Turn, Turn I looked on each case and found it easily that it was in case number 5, disc 6.  In addition to this, on each disc, after you put it in, and on the TV, is a listing of the episodes on that disc.  It is true, the episodes are not listed on each disc and there is not a description of the episodes like the more expensive seasons of shows that you can buy like my seasons of West Wing I bought as I could afford them, as they even have a little booklet in each case explaining each episode and what episodes are on each disc.  But even if you buy the series by what is available for Cagney and Lacey, they don't have the episodes listed nor captioned.  So for what I expected, the box has more than what I thought it had and I am really sorry I hesitated as I could have gotten it cheaper.  However, I am completely satisfied as the shows are good, they are not grainy or poor in quality and as I mentioned you can easily find the episodes you want to see.  The box itself is sturdy and each case/season of discs are packed well.  DO NOT HESITATE.  THIS IS WORTH THE MONEY.  But if you wait until it goes much higher, it won't be.  So take it from me; however its true I am easy to please, but still; what I have said is all true.  I think this is a great buy and I am thoroughly enjoying watching all of them.  Buy this guys, its a lot better than what they are saying and I don't think we are going to get any better any time soon.  So for what is offered out there for this show, this is one ""Heckava buy.  Excuse the grammer, but it is a very good buy and worth the money.  Really, these are good and I'm giving it 5 stars.  It's worth all of them.",1360022400,3,2840,4.042933810375671

The DVD set itself lacks any special features and the picture and audio quality is just ok, but if all you want are the episodes with Sharon Gless as ""Cagney"", then you'll do fine with this set. Upping my review to 3 stars because of my love for the show. Can't give it 4 stars because of the grief I went through with the bad disks. The company should do better Quality Control on their products.

Buyers beware.... I've gotten 2 sets now with a bad disk.

I loved ""Cagney and Lacey"" when it originally aired and was thrilled to finally have the complete series on DVD. After waiting nearly a month after the advertised release date for my set to arrive, I was disappointed to find disk 2 from set 2 has errors on it and the third episode on the disk - ""Choices"" - doesn't play at all. Amazon was great in sending a replacement out to me quickly but this set has the same issue. Appears to be on the DVD printing or pressing side but who knows for sure. I'm not sure if I'm going to send the whole set back from another exchange, refund or just live without the one episode. Maybe if the set didn't cost so much I'd consider the latter, but it's hard to let it go for that much money.",1357171200,4,1441,4.430188679245283

The drama and the issues covered in these episodes are as relevant today as they were when they were first aired.  This is a ""must see"" for those of us who grew up with this series and the younger (particularly female) generation should be encouraged to watch it to see that the issues that they are now facing are not new.  In addition to all of that it is still extremely entertaining!",1356220800,3,585,4.4485981308411215
5325598,2,B009GGWWL4,"I have to agree with just about everyone else: The Limited Edition version sold by the Canadian video company and put together by Barney Rosenzweig is the MUCH better deal than this new, generally released 30th Anniversary edition that Amazon is selling. I find it kind of funny that we are all reviewing the Limited Edition, here, on Amazon when Amazon doesn't even sell what we are talking about! I got my Limited Edition in the mail a few days ago and immediately went to the final DVD that had a 2007 2-part documentary on the importance of ""Cagney & Lacey"" at its time in the 1980's. This 2-part piece is wonderful to watch, however everyone interviewed is not identified, so you sometimes have to make guesses based on what angle of the show they are talking about. Regarding the 1-hour British Film Institute (?) table discussion of the series recorded in November 2011, it is a WONDERFUL hour, although the quality of the audio and video is not very god. The mic levels were all too high so there is often distortion. Also, the moderator of the panel - CLEARLY an obsessed fan of the show as we are -- is never identified, but asks ALL the right questions. The Limited Edition set from the ""Cagney & Lacey"" website is THE version to get, regardless of how cheaper it is than the poor and incomplete edition Amazon is selling. As for the enclosed C&L picture, autographed by Gless & Daley.... WONDERFUL. I read a previous review that thought very little of it, but -I- think it is actually terrific. It's headed for a nice frame very soon. I want to thank everyone here who mentioned the Limited Edition so I would buy THAT instead of the substandard Amazon release. I am quite happy with my purchase and it will last a lifetime!",1354924800,4,1736,4.5495207667731625

8541261,1,B009GGWWL4,"Very poor quality video.  Every episode on every disk at some point froze or the picture became garbled.  I bought this as a present for a long time C&L fan.  Interestingly, she has a DVD of the first season when it was released years ago.  That product was produced by MGM studios, and ALL of the disks, and every episode works fine.  So it is not my equipment.  This product is garbage.  Save your money. Do NOT buy this or you will be very disappointed.",1462492800,5,456,4.294117647058823
