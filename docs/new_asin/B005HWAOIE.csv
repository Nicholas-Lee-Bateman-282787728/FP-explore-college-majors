4706332,4,B005HWAOIE,"If you're into cheesy japanese films this is right up your alley!  Some pretty sexy scenes in Attack Girls.  But they are all good, cheesy, japanese zombie fun!",1355875200,,160,4.678571428571429
4706333,4,B005HWAOIE,While some of the japanese culture is above my head - the titles of these movies are exactly what you get - very entertaining for a B movie night flick!,1350345600,,152,4.1
4706334,4,B005HWAOIE,"Bought this one for Zombie Hunter Rika
(aka: Strongest weapon, High school girl Rika)
No point in paying for 1 movie when you can get 3 for the same price.

Zombie Self Defence Force.
Pretty good movie, tongue in cheek but not slapstick, as the characters
take themselves quite seriously. Gory yes but a bit cheap (as the whole trilogy is)
Entertaining? definitely.

Attack Girls' Swim Team Vs. The Undead.
PINK movie (aka cinemax style soft core)
Sexy surgically enhanced lead actress can't really save this movie.
The acting is flat and the SFX nearly non existing. Gory yes but super cheap.
nonsense plot and lame bad guys.
There is about 2 maybe 3 scenes in the whole movie that are worth ogling over.

Zombie Hunter Rika.
Only movie i really wanted to see, unfortunately only movie I had expectations going in.

I really wish this movie was better, as the idea behind it is very cool.
But there is just too much lacking with it.
I can excuse the cheap SFX if the concept and execution are effective.
But I think the problems lies with Rika...
She is not portrayed in a MOVIE fashion, she is not sexy or sassy or displays cute but corny bravado.

She behaves how a REAL 16 to 17 year old high school girl would in a situation as such...frightened and helpless.
Actually Rika is quite vapid, often her allies are slaughtered in front of her
while she looks on with a look of confoundment  and  horror.
By the time her fighting scenes come, the audience is incapable of suspending their disbelief
that she is the one doing all this zombie butt kicking (which she clearly is not...lol )

I really wanted to love ZHR but in the end was mildly entertained by it.",1334448000,12,1661,4.513333333333334
4706335,4,B005HWAOIE,"This trio is a mix of Japanese fetish and horror (albeit laughable) genre. Each film is entertaining enough but the Attack Swim Team had some XXXtra sequences I didn't really expect( hint not for the kiddies!)If you like Robogeisha or Tokyo Gore Police this one is right up there. If you're expecting some Romero style shamblers you might want too look elsewhere, but if you want some fun with a sprinkle of wackiness, this is the ticket!",1329868800,2,438,4.701298701298701
4706336,3,B005HWAOIE,"Ok, the first movie is pretty bad, the swim team and Rika were pretty fun movies.  All had pretty darn good effects other than the first which had some horrible CG.  Are any of these ""must have"" films?  NO, but Rika and the Swim Team offered your bang for the buck with plenty of gore, and sex to please.  Stories are pretty silly and i just totally had to laugh when you notice they lay cloth on the floors where they are doing the special effects and blood.... LOL.  So, if you want 2 decent B asian horror movies grab it. I can't really say anything good about Zombie Self-Defense Force as it was just tedious to watch, but had a few decent effects.",1324684800,6,652,4.225806451612903
4706347,4,B005HWAOIE,"You want zombies, zombies, zombies, and a little pinku to boot? You can't go wrong with the Nihombie box set. The set gets four stars for Rika's sake.

_Zombie Self Defense Force_ - two star
Marred by WWII revisionist ranting*, not even the panty shots could save this dud. The second star is just for what i will call the 'parade' scene - you'll know it when you get there and i won't say any more to avoid spoilers; insane and surreal. I did like the Captain, i hope he chooses to fight zombies again, in a better movie. I wish they had at least let you personally devour the idiot who killed you, Taichou!

_Attack Girl's Swim Team Versus the Undead_ - three star
Mixed bag: skin and cheesy fun versus weak logic and rape. (All you mad scientists out there: mind control does not equal consent.) We *need* to know more about that secret weapon.

_Zombie Hunter Rika_ - four stars
This was the gem of the Nihombie set. Good, cheesy, fun. Revels in its low budget without being self-congratulatory about it. Aggressive pacing, there were scenes that might have lent themselves to lingering (the three maids...). Skip the last sixty seconds and you will be happier - that last minute adds nothing and spoils the mood.

Suggested order for sober viewing:
1) ZSDF (if you watch this one at all, get it out of the way so)
2) Swim Team
3) Rika - saving the best for last, but remember to skip the last minute

Suggested order for drunk viewing:
1) Swim Team -- get your buzz started
2) Rika -- the high point, and the downer second ending will get you ready for the disaster to come
3) ZSDF -- really, it's okay if you don't remember this one tomorrow. call a taxi or grab a sofa.

*if the revisionism was ""ironic"" I missed the point completely.",1452729600,4,1741,4.40809968847352

4706355,3,B005HWAOIE,"Well, at least the first film was bearable. It was glorious schlock. As for the other two, entertaining I suppose but I can't imagine a scenario where I'll ever watch them again. I can toss them into the pile I guess.

8473788,3,B005HWAOIE,"Warning: The first movie in this trilogy ZOMBIE SELF-DEFENSE FORCE has an anti-American introduction and lingering subtext throughout. The female lead is a cyborg being prepared for a future war with the States. Will someone please remind the nationists Japanese (at least these filmmakers) that Japan attacked us at Pearl Harbor, killing noble American servicemen. We did not attack Toyko.

The humorous rip-off or imitation of George Romero (a talented filmmaker but hardly an Orson Welles) is exaggerated to the point of ludicrous lampoon. Subtle it is not.",1488067200,2,560,5.363636363636363
