1848566,5,B00008J2FD,"When I first heard about this series i thought to myself "" What another Boobies anime"" but I could not have been more wrong. The story is about a boy named Kei who has a rare disease which he calls a "" Standstill"", he is not your average 15 year old boy, he is actually 18. But he then sees an alien landing on the lake near where he lives. Thinking it only to be a dream he goes to school the next day only to discover that his new hometeacher is the alien he saw last night. She is beautiful and not surprisingly has the biggest boobies in anime history ( that is not true but who cares... Boobies) But yeah.... Kei is then forced to marry his teacher Mizuho Kusangi and keep her secret and she has to keep his secret about his disease. But the funniest bit of the first DVD is when the Principle having just found about that they are "" MARRIED"" gives the new couple marrital advise and on doing so shows a picture of his wife who is about 16 in the photo... with that Kei sees the photo and says...in a monotone voice "" SHE'S JUST JAILBAIT "".... classical or what.... Hahaha",1058054400,,1077,4.133333333333334
1848567,5,B00008J2FD,"You'll hear Mizuho Kazami, the main character - the alien teacher, say that a lot.  First off, this DVD has nothing but art in it.  The lovely backgrounds, the animated characters and everything seems perfect.  The characters seem like real people, at least they're not too flat, and the stories are about relationships with a lot of humor and fan service tossed in.  The voices were well selected and even the sci-fi elements seem both interesting and cool.  Even the trailer and the promo clip which are on the DVD extras, along with a design gallery, are nice.
Well drawn, well written and well done.  I plan to get them all!
Oh, no sex.  Sorry guys/gals.",1057104000,10,658,4.620689655172414
1848568,3,B00008J2FD,"Please Teacher is a pretty good anime, but it falls short from being anything more. If you're not expecting a masterpiece, it can be quite entertaining really. There's a good amount of humor and some fun characters to follow. The story is rather weak, but it's good enough.
The relationship between Mizuho and Kei just never seems to click. It never seems to stop being awkward, and that's really ashame. I just can't agree with some of the ""choices"" made in the series, and I know anyone in that position would not choose the path in this series. It feels stretched with no explanation of why. Mizuho makes even less sense in this fashion. I'm being quite vague, but I don't want to spoil things.
Frankly I think they just tried way too hard. Just when you think things might finally get on track, they're jerked back again and without warning, things take a sharp left turn. It barrows far too much from series like Ah! My Goddess and does a rather poor job at it.
This isn't a series I'd recommend, as hard as that is for me to say about any anime. If you've watched all the other recent animes and you need something new, go for it. Otherwise, use caution. It's not horrible, in fact I had a rather good time watching it. But there's just better animes out there to choose from.

1848569,5,B00008J2FD,"I have watched the story 4 times, and I am still moved to laughs and tears... I am an incurable romantic, and this is a MUST if you are one too. Despite I do not own this Box Set yet (But will soon, as soon as all Pioneer DVDs are out) I saw the whole series, and I must say that anyone who really loves a romantic story (comedy and drama) should buy this. Oh, we have comedy as well, but I would classify this as a pure romantic story, with real comedy ensuing only on the 13th episode, wich is commonly known as the OT OVA. I disagree with those reviews classifying the story as unbeliavable or cliche. True romantic comedies are common in Japan, but this one is really full of emotion and it aproaches the relationships among the characters in a way I have not seen yet. We see how a couple relationship can grow, and sometimes be troublefull. we see jealousy playing, we see selfishness masked as unselfishness, and we see how traumatic experiences can shape our lives, and how sometimes we become so afraid of life that we choose to run from it, masking our fears as worries for friends or relatives... Well, I do not wish to spoil things, so really go into the DVDs and check for yourself, I am sure you will at least have a very rewarding experience, for the animation is MAGNIFICENT, and the music is fabulous (I have the DVD Music Collection and now I am cruising for the CDs...and as this Box comes with the OST CD, I am really moved to buy it, for the songs on the Music Collection are awesome, I got struck the first time I run the DVD Mus. Col.),the songs and music blend completely in accordance with the anime mood, in total tandem with the scenes and the story.
 And a word for those who critized the 13th episode... I will admit that the final episode (12) had a real beautifull end, but as I finished watching it, I was already starving for more, and then I saw the 13th, and despite it is really different in overall mood from the rest of the series (it is really a comedy show, with lots of gags and SD animation) it is welcome as a lighten up, for I was really moved to tears on the last 4 episodes, and got recovered after watching the 13th... and the ""Love Scene"" we have there is really beautifull and is a true reward for us who watched the whole series. Sorry but I see nothing wrong there... Is a real beautifull and well done scene, completely in accordance with the series, and should have been inserted on the 12 episode... Those who watched the series know the story enough and well to be aware that there is no real awkward situation here, for the couple do not actually have that much age difference, and they do love each other deeply, and we really dwell on a love story wich has a real touching drama on it, and you will become aware of this by the end of the series... There is much more hentai and ecchi scenes and situations on the Love Hina series, wich is much more comedy than Onegai Teacher (Please Teacher)
 The only complain I have is that the series is over after the 13th episode... But I wish they do go forward with a real OVA (not the Onegai Teacher 2 series, for it is not about our characters here, despite it is possible they do appear) and I also think they should have gone deeper with some characters... Specially Morino Ichigo... I liked her a lot...
 This told, really if you intend to buy the series, you must be a romantic comedy lover already, so go ahead, for you will be really pleased, and this will surelly become a treasure on your DVD collection, therefore this Special Edition may be the right choice... I know that despite I have all Asian DVDs of the series, I intend to acquire this one, because I know Pioneer quality, and it will be a Treasure Item on my (or anyones's) Anime Collection.",1056067200,3,3760,4.307909604519774
1848570,5,B00008J2FD,"i found that this movie was one of the best animes that i have seen yet!!! though the consept of the movie would only work in japan, it is one of true love over coming the adversities that life brings up. i really truely love the show and hope that the next dvd comes out really soon.",1055721600,,284,4.0
1848571,5,B00008J2FD,"I <3 this series!!!  The only complaint that I have with it is the fact that they altered the name to Please Teacher from Onegai Teacher.  But other than that, this is an awsome series and a must see for any anime otaku.",1053129600,,220,4.093023255813954
1848572,4,B00008J2FD,"I can honestly say, being a fan of anime completely different from Please Teacher, that this is a great series. It's a terrific blend of romance and comedy (Sometimes, extremely funny) and enough seriousness to keep things in balance.
A couple things keep it away from 5 stars, however. It is a bit predictable, and some of the main characters are neglected or just plain uninteresting. In the last few episodes, be ready for a complete change in atmosphere, and even though this is done on purpose, it is pretty taxing on the viewer.
Also, the OVA (Which I'm guessing will be released in the future) is downright silly, but essential for fans of Please Teacher.
The content is cleaner than you might expect. There is naturally some talk about sex and risque dialogue, but nothing really beyond that. 13 and up is a good range for viewers.
Check this one out. No matter what type of anime you're in, you may be pleasantly suprised.",1052697600,5,931,4.648484848484848
1848573,5,B00008J2FD,"Please Teacher is about a story of a boy who gets ""involved"" with his teacher and their daily lives together. Of course there are more details in the story but i don't wanna spoil it for you. this anime is kinda reminiscent of Oh my goddess (by the same director), and the animation is one of the best that i've seen in a while. I love this anime because the story is great and there are some warm fuzzy parts that makes you feel good. (yes i admit it).
At first glance this dvd make look like a ""booty"" anime, like another love hina wanabe. but give it a chance and it may surprise you that the themes to the episodes are more mature and deals with issues about jealousy and the consequences of a teacher student relationship. The story also has a deeper meaning that can only be felt watching the dvd. Don't get me wrong  there are funny and perverted parts especially kei's uncle. but overall this is a dvd that definetly should be checked out!",1052179200,6,947,4.320224719101123
1848574,5,B00008J2FD,"ive seen this whole serie... in jap. If you like love story this is a great moive for u then...!!! onegai = please teacher, well, is about a boy who lost his memory( fall asleep for 3 years)
so that will say that his age are 18 and go to high school...
teacher from outer space visit earth and become a teacher on i school. and the love story begins...  the boy and the teacher fell in love... and many things happends in the movie... onegai teacher is so great love dvd... you buy, you be happy... just se this movie!!!!",1049760000,2,521,4.158415841584159
1848575,5,B00008J2FD,"Please Teacher was a series that I'd seen selling at Japanese online stores, like Amazon Japan.  Based on it's popularity there, I decided it would be worth the investment ($100 for all four DVDs), and immediately bought the first DVD when it became available.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was definitely pleasantly surprised.  I found the story to be emotionally charged but with enough fun to keep things in control.
Though it can be viewed as a bit predictable and cliche, Please Teacher's story deals with a simple question.  Why must there be both happiness and sadness?  Kei, the male lead, faces the dilema head on and finds the answer with the help Mizuho, the female lead, and his friends.  They learn that life is NOT all laughs; a person must deal with the highs and lows of life.  That you can't be happy 100% of the time unless you come to a complete stand still.  That you can't force someone else to be happy nor should you sacrifice your happiness in order to create happiness in someone else's life.
This series is not for someone who is looking for a whimsical story, but, if you're an emotional person who empathizes with movie characters, I recommend Please Teacher.",1069632000,8,1194,4.625592417061611
1848576,5,B00008J2FD,"Please Teacher is, without a doubt, one of the best anime series I have ever seen.  At first I thought that this was going to be reminiscent of Love Hina or maybe even Tenchi Muyo, but it was not.  The anime has its own flavor, a nice set of supporting cast and a good developing story line.
In standard anime theme, a voluptuous twenty-one year old alien falls from the sky and a geeky fifteen year old boy (who was in a coma for three years so he is actually eighteen) sees her.  The alien is actually on a mission to spy on the earth and watch the primitive planet develop.  Said alien goes to the local school and becomes a teacher.  There she finds Kei, the geeky guy, and confronts him to make sure that he won't tell she is an alien.  They accidentally get locked in the room together and the principal finds them together.  To prevent the alien (Mizuho) from getting fired and starting a scandal, they say that they are married.  The series then develops around the two trying to start a relationship at home while keeping everything secret from the class and faculty.
This anime has a more mature theme then other animes.  If you are looking for martial arts, alien invasions, and cosmic battles, you'll have to go elsewhere.  The artwork and music is excellent.  I would highly recommend this anime.",1065830400,,1309,4.481012658227848

1848578,4,B00008J2FD,"I wasn't sure what to expect from ""Please, Teacher.""  The title and cover gave a certain impression of it's contents, but many reviews of the anime said something different.
I was glad I gave it a shot, and found the first episodes to be a cute romance, with nice characters and an enjoyable storyline.  There is nothing particularly revolutionary here storywise, and it is in many ways a by-the-numbers animation.  The standard mixed-match love affair is always good for a heart tug, when the main characters are disarmingly honest and their affection is plain. Very sweet, all in all.
""Please, Teacher"" does highlight a particular cultural difference between Japan and the United States that is interesting.  While upsetting to some, relationships and marriages between teachers and former students are not particularly unusual in Japan, and may elicit a chuckle at best.  A woman teacher/male student marriage is not as common as a male teacher/woman student combination, but it is not so shocking.
The animation is good, the character design is good, the story is good.  This is a formula that is done very well in Japanese animation, and ""Please, Teacher"" is a good entry in the genre.",1065052800,4,1190,5.0152284263959395
1848579,5,B00008J2FD,"There is no way to discuss the plot of this series to a newcomer without sounding bizarre. A 15-year-old, who is actually 18-years-old, who has married his schoolteacher, who is actually an alien.... ?? Sound strange? Well, yes. But what is so wonderful about this series is that it falls together with grace and poise, and along the way reveals the ""Teacher"" series to be a truly engaging and sweet love story, as innocent and charming as the plot circumstances are strange.
The story is well written, the characters are interesting and personable, the artwork is clean and rich, and each episode has you wanting more. It's a good buy.",1064275200,,636,4.790909090909091
1848580,3,B00008J2FD,"I watched the first disk with much anticipation and was somewhat let down.
The art is good. The music is decent. The anime...
My problem is that I read the books (manga) first. The books are excellent and the anime follows the books (at least in the first disk) very closely. Thus, no surprises.
On top of that, it seemed to me that the situations that the kids were put into that were supposed to be awkward were forced. Thrown in your face in such a way where the awkwardness was lost for the sake of making the situation as obvious as possible.
The great thing about the books is that you had to read between the panels and I think there was a lot more emotional byplay there than in the anime.
I hear the next disk breaks away from the books a bit and I'm willing to give it a try for that reason - to see if it stands on its own or not.
I will say that this Manga to Anime translation is a lot better than ""Real bout High"" of which the Manga is 5 stars plus and the Anime would be less than one given the option.",1063497600,,1017,4.014778325123153

After reading the last few reviews, i just thought either: 'this guy has no taste' or 'this guy needs to realize its a review of the DVD', well anywho, i'm not leaving this as a review on the series, but as a review on the reviews before me: They suck! none of them help at all. one thing i've learned is: Never, ever listen to reviews! just go rent the thing, and if u like it, buy it; and if you don't, don't buy it. everyone has different opinions so never buy/don't buy something because the review says to. in my opinion ""Onegai Sensei"" is a really good series, there are 13 episodes total (episode 13 being the oav) and my recomendation on it is ages is 13+ (or as long as they r mature). and a sequel (well kinda) ""Onegai Twins"" which has just begun airing in japan (July 2003) i've been watching the episodes as they've been coming out, and so far 'WOW!' its great. the main char's from onegai teacher are still here, except they r not the main char's anymore (the twins r not children of mizuho and kei) ugh, gomen.

7984653,3,B00008J2FD,"There are quite a few good things about Please Teacher.  First of all, there are some fairly unique story elements.  (at least one or two).  The girl who came from the heavens isn't quite unique, but it was a notch above the standard girl meets boy routine.  And Kei's illness is quite an interesting idea.  Secondly, the animation is gorgeous...at least in the main characters.  Kei's aunt and uncle aren't very pretty (and why does the aunt NEVER open her eyes?), but Kei, Koishi, Miss Kazumi, and the rest of Kei's friends are all very nicely done.

This is one series where I don't just think that the English dub is better than the japanese, I don't like the japanese at all.  Everyone sounds the same!  There is very little of the emotion you usually hear in the japanese  voice acting.  And while I'm not overly fond of the English dub, at least you can tell who is talking if you have your eyes closed.  And I love Ichigo's dead pan, indifferent style of talking.  (although I must admit it threw me for a loop at first).

But beyond that...nothing really grabs me.  Even though I did watch the first 3 (of 4) DVDs to this series in a stretch, it wasn't because I HAD to know what happened, or really felt connected with the characters...it was mainly because I was just, well...bored.  This is a very easy series to watch.  It doesn't take any effort at all.  But the charcters are slightly annoying at times.  Kei, while I understand is dealing with some HUGE issues, is a little too whiny for me, especially in the 1st DVD.  And Miss Kazumi, though she comes from a far more civilized race, and has been selected out of her entire race to gather information (and therefore must have SOMETHING on the ball)...she's just a little too dim witted for my liking.

The music is OK, but it doesn't draw me in like the opening sequences of Pretear, His and Her Circumstances, Neon Genesis Evangelion, or Noir.  (I gave the range of anime genres for top music)  The DVD extras aren't really too exciting.  Just the standard clean opening/closing sequences.  And, as with all 13 episode series, after the first DVD, there are only 3 episodes per DVD.

All in all, I don't dislike this series.  It is cute, it is warm spirited...it just doesn't grab me and pull me in.  It doesn't make me want to start reading the manga, or collecting the figures, or even the sound track.  I believe it fully deserves a place in any anime lovers collection, but there are many other series out there that are much more...convincing.",1092009600,4,2517,4.518847006651884
