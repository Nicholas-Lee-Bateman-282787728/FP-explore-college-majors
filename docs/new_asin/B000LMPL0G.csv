8162172,3,B000LMPL0G,"Dutt's 2006 Flick 'Dil Diya Hai' is a decent entertainer. Average at best. The story of the film is not interesting,but however the filmmaker manages to make a decent film. The film has its share of Pluses and minuses. An Okay fare.
The Performances are good. Mithun Dada continues his Legendary magic with Dil Diya Hai. He's fantastic. Emraan Hashmi is good. Ashmit Patel shines in a Grey role. Geeta Basra looks amazingly hot and does a good job. She's sexy. Kitu Gidwani is good. The music of the film is excellent.
On the whole 'Dil Diya Hai' is an average watch.",1304380800,,567,4.568627450980392

  MITHUN CHAKRABORTY IS WASTED IN HERE.

  DON'T BUY IT SPECIALLY FOR MITHUN FANS.",1172966400,,154,3.966666666666667
