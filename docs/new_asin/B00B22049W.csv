8561224,3,B00B22049W,"This is a 2010 film repackaged. Thomas (Andrew Howard) owns a design studio and has trouble sleeping. As it turns out this is a modern Jekyll and Hyde film. Thomas doesn't remember what his other half does at night, but he leaves him notes and messages on his phone.

There is talk radio chatter in the background that connects to the film. Normally I like this stuff as being clever, but this one is borderline. The acting was decent. Good characters. The plot didn't keep up with the rest of the film. The film has a quirky style to it. It is listed as a horror and indeed the film has horror elements such as blood and killing, but I did feel it as a horror as much as I did a thriller.

Worth a rental.

8561225,5,B00B22049W,"Got an early look at this film and I found it to be a fun and wild ride of a movie.  Billy Burke plays a crazy pawn shop owner and there are a lot of recognizable faces that pop up throughout the movie.  It is a really cool take on the Jekyll and Hyde mythology.  If you are a fan of independent cinema, you should take the time to watch this one.",1365379200,3,347,3.7916666666666665
