But the way it moves from fish and spiders and concludes with primates and humans, an evolutionary hierarchy is implied.  Some stuff is gross:  I hate looking at that toad with the babies on its back.  I turned my face during that.  I also appreciated learning that one type of mother spider allows her children to eat it, but I didn't need to see it.  There are many a cute animal here:  baby penguins, baby hippoes, etc.  I am sure we've all heard the phrase ""Nature is cruel.""  Well, this program tries to balance things.  Sometime I felt that it showed more of the optimistic side because depressed viewers may turn off the program.  Still, they showed a hyena eating a baby seal, a lemur abandoning its child and looking highly conflicted about it, an adult lion killing cubs.  The sad side of animal life does come up.  They show platypus, an intermediate mammal.  However, they don't show male starfish releasing its young, something that could excite many viewers.  This would be nice to show in junior high school biology classes.",1437004800,,1214,4.677725118483412
