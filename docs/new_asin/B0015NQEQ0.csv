8259180,5,B0015NQEQ0,"I love all of this DVD's. I was looking for good Bellydance DVD's a long time. I just bought a terrible german one (I am from Germany) and these ones are much better!!!
I also love the live performances which are on each DVD. You can watch one live performance which is the one you also can learn on this DVD and then you can watch a live drum solo performance.

So if you would like to learn a bit more Bellydance at home, buy these DVD's!!!",1316995200,,442,4.080459770114943
8259181,4,B0015NQEQ0,"I like this set a lot more than Jillina's previous three-dvd set, but that could just be my taste.  I love the drum solo!  The first dvd, the entrance, was my least favorite of the three.  The movements were a little too fast for me.",1232841600,,233,4.133333333333334
8259182,5,B0015NQEQ0,"I always enjoy Jillinas DVDs. Her smile and joyous persona makes you want to get up and sweat. You can always count on pure professionalism from Jillina.
The movements are broken down, repeated (but not too much).  It does just what she says she's going to do:
warm-up, technique, breakdown & drills, combinations, choreography, and all that live performance stuff that us dancers love to watch.

The camera work, which isolates shots of the torso, then full body, then mirrored body, and some feet also helps the learning process. I am waiting for Jillina to do a slow Sensuous belly dance with her stomach, flutters and abdominal rolling included.",1216166400,7,649,4.944954128440367
8259183,5,B0015NQEQ0,"First, I have to say I haven't tried the other two dvd's--I only have the drum solo and I LOVED it! I wasn't expecting much based on some reviews that compared it with her other choreography dvd's. I like her other set ok, but this one is much better by far. I love this drum solo dvd. If you want to be able to hear rhythms and have combinations ready, this is for you!
  She shows three different rhythms and many combinations to go w/them. She then takes the combos and creates a choreography. I like it better than the other drum solo dvd's I have tried because this she identifies (and the menu identifies) what rhythm your dancing to and then teaches the combo. I did think their was quite a bit of technique here, unlike another reviewer. There is also plenty of practice time in the combo section.
  I now know that any time I hear the ayub rhythm, for example, that I will be able to bust out a combo that will go great with that rhythm! Thanks Jillina!
  I like this because you do learn choreography, but it's more than that. It really helps to deepen your understanding of hearing rhythms and being able to feel them in your dance. Great DVD!",1215561600,13,1154,4.319444444444445
8259184,3,B0015NQEQ0,"This is a nice dvd set, but you don't have to have it.  Its got coreography which I don't really need.  I wish it had more technique, and advanced bellydance moves.  But there is plenty of material to have fun with.  There is the move, then drill repetition, then combinations and coreography.  Its not necessary to have this set, but if you can, then why not.  Its similiar to Jillinas other dvd set.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Instructional-Bellydance-With-Jillina-Level-1/dp/B0001906OA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Instructional Bellydance With Jillina - Level 1</a>",1215216000,4,609,6.365853658536586
