7016652,5,B00TQ4PBBO,"You can't make a bad movie about the life of Pablo Escobar...that is impossible.  Say what you want about him, but he was the Al Capone of Colombia, perhaps even more legendary than Capone himself.  I have seen Cocaine Cowboys (2006), The Two Escobars (2010), Blow (2000) with Johnny Depp, and the True Story of Killing Pablo (TV movie 2002), all dealing with the life and death of Pablo Escobar.  Escobar Paradise Lost (2014) is not a biographical film on Pablo, but rather a romance/thriller on a certain episode in the life of Pablo.  The story of the film begins in the early 1980's with a group of Canadian hippies that settle a remote beach-front in Colombia (the film was originally shot in Panama).  Among them is an idealistic young man by the name of Nick (Josh Hutcherson) who makes living from giving surf-lessons.  Fate has it one day he runs into a beautiful girl who is helping the local community with the money given by her uncle, Pablo Escobar (Benicio Del Toro)...the notorious drug lord whose name went down in history as one of the most controversial figures of Colombian political and social scene since the creation of its modern day country.

Benicio Del Toro's portrayal of Pablo Escobar truly stands out from all the rest. Del Toro holds a monopoly on playing historically controversial Latin personalities, beginning with Ernesto Che Guevara and ending on Pablo Escobar.  Who knows, in the future he might play others: such as Simon Bolivar, Rafael Trujillo, or maybe even Fidel Castro.",1431302400,2,1513,4.837209302325581
7016653,4,B00TQ4PBBO,"I thoroughly enjoyed this film, despite the fact that it concentrates of what seems to be a limited period of the life of Pablo Escobar, a few years before the time where he constituted himself prisoner in 1991 and put an end to his assassination campaign in exchange for a lenient treatment and sentence, and a promise that he would not be extradited to the United States.

The story is that of a young Canadian surfer (Josh Hutcherson) established on a beach in Columbia who falls in love with the niece of Pablo Escobar (Benicio Del Toro) without knowing so. He gets increasingly dragged into Escobars hyper violent and ruthless universe and is increasingly reluctant to become part of it, hence the films title: Paradise Lost.

I will, of course, not mention the plot or how it ends but will just mention that this is a dark, rather despairing and hyper violent thriller. More than the violence itself, it is the tension and the almost suffocating atmosphere that comes across which makes this film so worthwhile. Most of this is due to the fantastic performance of Benicio Del Toro who manages to make to make his character into someone that is simply terrifying and utterly ruthless, as the real drug lord probably was.

Also well presented in the scenario are a number of features associated with the reign of the drug baron.

One of these was the carefully cultivated image of a Latin American Robin Hood that he created for himself and behind which he tended to hide. It may even have been sincere, given his own modest origins, but it was also very convenient and very useful for him to play the protector and the defender of the poor and destitute. It seems to have largely worked since, at least in his own region, he seems to have been very popular, had tens of thousands of supporters and was even elected in the early 80s as a member of the Columbian House of Representatives.

Another feature, linked to some extent to the previous one, was the collusion that existed between him, the local police and even some of the armed forces whose services he had bought after eliminating those (allegedly hundreds) that disagreed.

However, because the whole film revolves around the personality of Pablo Escobar and the fantastic performance of Benicio, the main events of his career, while mentioned, tend to take a backseat. For instance, the film never shows explicitly to what extent he managed to control the cocaine traffic towards the United States. At one point, it is estimated that 80% of what reached the US was sent by him or his associates.

Another limit is that the film contains virtually nothing about his relations with other Colombian drug lords at the beginning of his career, and nothing at all about his constant and merciless war of assassinations against his rivals of the Cali cartel. A third weakness is that the effort deployed the Reagan and Clinton administrations to combat drugs, the huge financial and military support provided to the Columbian government and the just as important constant pressure put on it to combat both the left-wing guerrillas and the drug lords are either barely mentioned and entirely omitted.

Essentially, the whole film is about the personality of Pablo and Benicios very powerful incarnation of the drug lord, with the benevolent mask and pretence slipping at times and then disappearing completely to be replaced by the merciless monster lurking beneath it. This is both the main strength of this superb film, but also perhaps also its main limitation. Four stars, with at least two for Benicios performance",1430956800,4,3577,4.852459016393443

7016774,3,B00TQ4PBBO,"well, 2nd Benicio Del Toro movie (that I've seen), he delivers, he is a good actor but weak movie plot. Definitely not one of my all time favorites. I think this movie failed to capture Escobar's ""essence"", though the ruthlessness eventually showed. I like the innocence portrayed by his naive niece and  soon to be fiance as they figure out the man he really is. Worth watching, this is NOT a film on Pablo Escobar per se, more of a sideline scene and the consequences of playing a role in his life.",1482969600,,500,4.434782608695652

7016884,3,B00TQ4PBBO,"I lived in Colombia back in the 1980s when Escobar was king.  The people loved him but also feared him.  When there was a natural disaster or people in a town lost their jobs because a factory moved, etc - Escobar was right there handing out money.  He also gave people jobs and always gave them housing with it - so they were indebted to him.  If they thought about trying to find another job, they would also have to find another home.  Not easy in that country, especially not for the typical working class Colombian.  This movie was entertaining and I especially like the character of Marie, who was like most of the young educate Colombian women I knew when I lived there - very aware of the handicaps of their country being under the thumb of the drug lords, but also doing everything they could to educate and help the bulk of the people.  Del Toro did a marvelous job capturing Escobar's personality - he was a lot of fun and charming but at the same time ruthless and shrewd.  Colombia is a very beautiful country, with its beautiful beaches, mountains, and flatlands, varied topography, but I can't imagine anyone thinking ""paradise"" when they see it.  The poverty is obvious everywhere, rural and urban areas.",1480291200,11,1220,4.585253456221198

The fictional love story involving himself and Pablo Escobar's fictional niece is generic and unbelievable, to say the least. The production value of the movie is good, but if you're interested in this movie for the Escobar storyline and don't care about the forced fictional romance, I'd suggest watching Narcos on Netflix.

7017052,2,B00TQ4PBBO,Escobar was used to sell the movie buy it was focused in not the family member but the boyfriend of a family member?! Actors  great! You can't go wrong with Benicio Del Toro!  story line poor thus the two stars,1475107200,,210,4.225
7017053,4,B00TQ4PBBO,"I enjoyed this film very much, but this is a work of fiction, not a historically accurate documentary.  That said, Del Toro perfectly captured Escobar's twisted ""morality"", his charm, and skillful manipulating of media, political systems and financial institutions.  The ""I've done some stuff I wish I didn't have to, but it's not my fault and I always had a good reason for doing what I did"" BS criminals use to justify their actions. As though providing free clinics and building churches cleaned the blood off his drug money.  The problem is, there's nothing you can do to scrub money that dirty clean.  Contaminated drug profits destroy everything it touches, a lesson Nick (Josh Hutcherson) learns too late. Some reviewers have criticized Hutcherson's performance and I would take issue with that.  I thought Hutcherson perfectly captured Nick's naivete, his difficulty understanding the culture and language and his desperation to get himself, his lovely fiance (Escobar's niece) and his brother's family out of Columbia.  From his awkward first meeting with Maria, to the even more awkward marriage proposal surrounded by cameras and reporters as Escobar used the occasion to boost his image, to the slow realization actually who and what Maria's uncle really was, to his utter confusion as he tries to extract himself from a situation he can barely comprehend, I felt his journey was completely believable.  The supporting cast was great, with the possible exception of Claudia Traisac as Maria.  I'm not a drama critic, but it seemed she was in over her head in this film.  She was good, but could have been better.  The cinematography and locations were lovely.  It was also nice to see a film that didn't fall back on the old standbys to sell a story; the unrealistic happy ending and the obligatory sex scene.  I heartily recommend this film.",1475020800,3,1854,5.022875816993464

Also, Benicio is an experienced actor and he did a good job, but sorry Benicio, we watched Narcos first, and the new actor and the plot in Narcos were wayyyyy better.

I don't think that I have to explain the story line of the movie. Other commentators have done a fine job in outlining its synopsis.

The production quality and acting are superb along with decent cinematography.  While the film uses the metaphysical to establish a happy ending, it can be compared to the happy endings one would find in Gladiator or perhaps Titanic.  If these are your kind of films, then by all means.  I don't really enjoy this sort of genre, but that's my bias.  That being said, I can only give three stars.  It does not mean that it isn't a good film for what it attempts to achieve.  The only thing I feel that could be done a bit better is character development.  However, it still is a quality film.",1463961600,,694,4.496

No matter how much Escobar reportedly helped the poor he coldly, cruelly and without a thought or care killed thousands upon thousands of men, women and children. The ONLY people safe from his wrath were his mom, wife and children....possibly his brother.  Yet somehow its not lost on me that he had a certain charm which was truly enhanced by the amazing performance of del Torro.

7017473,3,B00TQ4PBBO,"I absolutely love Benicio Del Toro in this as I do in most movies he is involved with.

7017537,4,B00TQ4PBBO,"Well acted.  As is typical with historical based dramas, I spent a lot of the movie browsing the internet around the events depicted.

Seems to put a slightly kind face on the whole Escobar operation, but then again, it was probably a bit extra demonized in North American press.

It seemed odd to have the entire movie centered around a fictional North American (""Canadian"") non-latino guy.  Could have just as easily been a local.  I guess it makes the movie being largely in english more believable.  Another interesting performance by Mr Del Toro. Always a good watch",1459209600,,571,4.835051546391752

There were far too many long, 'moody', lingering shots that could have been edited down.  Trust your audience.  We know how we feel and don't need a 5 minute lingering shot to convince us.

7017709,4,B00TQ4PBBO,"**** 4 Stars **** Perhaps too slow a burn for action-flick fans, but for others it will be a fine discovery.  I don't know why this movie is not better known / more appreciated - the story pulls you in and keeps you glued to the screen, and the location filming (OK, in Panama, not Columbia) is beautiful.  The coverage of 'Uncle Pablo' seems pretty accurate, and Benicio Del Toro plays him just right - a 'Godfather' far scarier than Brando ever was, Del Toro smolders and growls even as he tries to hide behind family (all of whom are actually dispensable).  Watch this fine film, then ""Sicario"" (2015) and you will be shocked at the CIA cozying up to Escobar's Medelln cartel in a fight to weaken the 'less controllable' Mexican cartels.  Crazy stuff ... and also check out the extraordinary film, ""Kill the Messenger"" (DVD only on N'flix, but if you have HBO on Demand, it's there, too).

7017764,3,B00TQ4PBBO,The creation of a fictional American main character as a story-telling device seemed contrived and unnecessary -- Escobar's  bigger than life personality and the stranglehold he had on the citizens and government of Colombia provide the kind of rich material Hollywood producers dream of.  Del Toro was amazing but the execution disappointed.  Better to invest your time in the Narco TV series.,1454544000,,394,5.32258064516129

My first thoughts were that this would be some cheesy hack-job romance revolved around surfing that tied Pablo Escobar in the mix. I was wrong...and glad! This movie had tension and was a thriller in the last act. I didn't see the ending coming either. Del Toro was great as Escobar. The fiancee did a great job. Hutcherson's role should have been played by someone else in my opinion, but he was serviceable. I was engaged the entire movie primarily because the movie cuts back and forth to form the complete story. The movie tied in real situations that Escobar was involved in while he was trying to track down our main character, so I thought that was a nice touch. All-in-all this is a highly watchable film.",1452211200,,815,4.706293706293707

7017894,4,B00TQ4PBBO,"Good movie, a little different angle but Escobar is well played by Benicio del Toro!

The character does not look a lot like the real Pablo Escobal, but does a very good job showing how bad he was as person behind the rest of the world. Very sad emotional movie with a lot of action and conspiracy; just the right recipe to keep you watching. I loved it and I am pretty sure you will too.",1451260800,,432,4.094117647058823

The white actor is a FAKE CHARACTER, as well as his girlfriend. there is no need to insert white people in history where they no belong to. This drama doent focus at all on the actual story of Escobar, nor colombia nor traffic...

No puedo creer que benicio del toro se presto para hacer esta pelicula. Ni la termine de ver. El chico blanco y su novia SON PERSONAJES INVENTADOS que nada tienen que ver con la historia de Escobar o colombia. Cuando los creadores de peliculas van a dejar de meter personajes ficticios blancos en la historia donde no pertenecen????
si quieren ver parte importante de la Historia de Colombia-Escobar-Narcotrafico
vean la serie PABLO EL PATRON DEL MAL..",1450483200,2,775,4.7407407407407405

7017981,4,B00TQ4PBBO,"It was an intriguing movie. Hutcherson played a good role, and Del Toro of course was a great/believable Pablo Escobar. He portrayed the bi-polar personality of a sociopath drug cartel leader perfectly.
It was interesting how the movie showed how religious (hypocritical) Escobar was. Meaning, he felt that the horrible things he did should just be forgiven because they were done to ""protect his family."" When in reality his actions were to first and foremost protect/maintain his drug empire, with his family reaping the benefits as a bi-product of his reign of terror.",1449014400,,571,5.150537634408602

Did their embassy know about this practice?

Of course, Benecio can do no wrong in my book, the guy is simply the greatest living actor of our time (he was second but now that the true master Phillip Seymour Hoffman has left the planet, he's in first). He totally channels Escobar, just as he did Che'. The story gets a teeny bit wonky a couple times; you know, those 'that would never happen' or 'people don't talk like that' moments, but overall it was gripping, suspenseful, and had a good share of violence in it (if you're not familiar with how insanely brutally vicious Escobar was, you may get queasy in certain parts but understand that the way he's depicted in the movie is the way he was in real life; the guy brought down a passenger jet killing 200 people, for Christ sake). I'd never seen Hutcherson before, he is a very fine actor as well. The whole movie is well cast, well acted, and well directed. Maybe not a 5-star, which I rarely give, but definitely all of 4; if they had half stars I'd say 4.5.",1447977600,4,1104,4.287081339712919

7018135,3,B00TQ4PBBO,"I finally took the plunge and watched EPL (for short) after watching Netflix's Narco's (Great Series) as well as being a big fan of Del Toro's work. I had high hopes for this movies somewhat unique storyline of young love mixed with a deadly family drug cartel. Ok, its not that original, but still I had hope.
The story is told in in segments that don't follow any chronological order, it would jump from after the begining to midway, near end and so on. This is a hard formula to tell a story with any effectiveness if its not done right and this one needed some help. Nick and Maria's relationship is glossed over as was Nick's relationship with Pablo. The reason Nick and his brother came to the area is also underdeloped and could have helped tell a more complete story.
The movie is two hours long and should have had enough time to develop the overall story much better than it did.
I'm not familiar with Nick (Josh Hutcherson) acting nor his love Maria (Claudia Traisac) work, but the two were believable as a couple. Nick's performance as the unwitting, oblivious or in denia boyfriendl to what was going on with Maria's uncle was a bit  OTT (over the top) . The performance of most of the characters was  good and believable and Del Toro was very good as Pablo Escobar.
The director and the writer are the weak links in this production as they (for me) don't effectively tell a compelling or complete story of the primary characters and there relationships with one another. They could have told this story in thiry minutes and it would have been more effective.
There was very little scenic landscape shots of the area as most is shot in the village or Pablo's homes and a few shots at the brothers surf shack location. I enjoy movies that highlight the local landscapes that have an abundance of beautiful locations. I can understand the director wanting to show the living conditions of the local population when it helps to tell its story, but as Maria mentions to Nick about all the Yankee's that have decended on the area. It would have been nice to see why they come for the beauty of the area.and not just for the drugs.
Given the subject matter of this story it is less violent and graphic than most in relation to this genre. There is some violence (dog attack) and blood as well as gun play, but not graphic nor filled with closeup kill scenes. There was no nudity or overt sex scenes and the cursing was minimal. 3 Stars",1447632000,,2442,4.497747747747748

Nick (Josh Hutchinson--AKA Peeta in Hunger Games) is a Canadian surf instructor  living in Colombia who falls in love with Pablo Escobar's young niece Maria. Nick and Maria's love story, like most love stories begin with a perfect connection, but there is drama the couple must overcome. This drama does not fault on Nick nor Maria, but as you would guess the drug lord uncle, who puts Nick in the ultimate pickle, where he must choose between love, death, and life. What he chooses takes him on wild rollercoaster that keeps you engaged until the end of the movie. The ending left me disappointed and with a sense of greater closure, thus the four stars instead of five. However, to find out how the movie ends you have to first watch the movie.

7018143,2,B00TQ4PBBO,"Like ""The Counselor,"" this is a depressing violent film about south of the border drug cartels and like ""Blow"" and a few other films of this genre, it features the late cocaine kingpin Pablo Escobar. Like The Counselor and Blow, it is also a cautionary tale about what happens when good people enter this dangerous subculture. Unlike The Counselor and Blow, it fails to develop any of its characters enough to make the viewer care. Cliff Curtis' portrayal of Escobar in Blow lasted about one minute onscreen and I felt like I had actually met the infamous El Padrone. Benicio Del Toro's Escobar was lifeless and sullen like Marlon Brando in Apocalypse Now. He would have made an excellent Saddam Hussein, however. Even if you're just looking for some trashy violent action, the film disappoints viewers because it only alludes to and doesn't show Escobar's revenge on a local gang of thugs who deserved it. The beauty and charm of the lovely Claudia Traisac is about the only thing I enjoyed in this film.",1447372800,,1005,4.781609195402299

7018166,3,B00TQ4PBBO,"Pretty fascinating movie, however there were a few drawbacks for me. Mainly there seemed to be a lot of holes in the story. What happens in between all those years? There is hardly an interaction with Escobar and Nico to really get you invested in the betrayal. If there was just a little more time spent in building upon that relationship it would have been such a great movie. There are terrifying parts in this movie that you have at the edge of your seat and they could have used a little more substance. I think overall, this movie suffered from a rushed edit. It could have probably used an extra 45-60 min.

Lastly, without spoiling too much, I am unsure if the events are true, however, I was left wanting more at the end. What were the consequences? What was it all for? Did anyone learn anything about what happened? What happened to Maria? Again... I think the abrupt ending is likely a casualty of rushed/too short movie.",1447113600,,933,4.520710059171598
7018167,4,B00TQ4PBBO,"We've recently watched the series ""Narcos,"" based on the same historical events from which this imagined sliver is no doubt sliced. The two very intense dramas really complement each other, to the point you could swear that some of the same actors are involved. This story becomes quite profound as it studies the dilemma faced by a young North American who falls for an Escobar niece who is supposedly as good as a daughter to the drug lord. It's something of a tragedy played out over easy-to-believe perilous requirements of the innocent new family member. A really good idea for a plot and finely realized playing out of harrowing circumstances.",1447113600,,649,4.909090909090909

Nor is it realistic, and the story has no authenticity, so the despair isn't even worth it. Between the cast types and the cliches this film is average.

7018395,4,B00TQ4PBBO,"The film is based upon the real story (if but portrayed inaccurately)
 of a Drug-Lord......'Pablo Escobar' played by 'Benicio Del Toro'
'Nick' (Josh Hucherson) a surfer has the one ambition, to, with brother 'Dylan' (Brady Corbet) set up a surfing-school
alongside an idyllic location, one they believe to have found in 'Columbia;
'Nick' falls for and gets involved with a beautiful local girl 'Maria' (Claudia Traisac) who's uncle 'Pablo' a much loved
senator who seems to quite simply to be a devoted family-man who jealously looks after his own along with his
local community is in fact one of the biggest drug-barons of his day, credited with supplying up to 80% of the Cocaine
that found it's way from 'Columbia' into the U.S.
How he portrays himself hides a very ruthless and calculating criminal...
After meeting 'Nick' who he calls 'Nico' now accepted as his nieces boyfriend, 'Pablo'offers a job on the estate along with
luxury accommodation, which 'Nick' accepts.
However, 'Nick' soon begins to feel uncomfortable working on the estate, he see's things and soon realizes the nature of
'Pablo's' business dealings, he wants 'Maria' to leave with him....it doesn't happen.
Eventually the authorities will close in on 'Pablo's' empire leaving the drug-baron with the one option, to make a deal and
give himself up, however before surrender takes place he must hide his fortune to protect his family's future, he has singled
out several locations for this and charges several trusted allies to follow his instructions to hide the fortune, 'Nick' is one
of those chosen.......however, 'Pablo' has no intention of leaving any witnesses to the wheabouts of his vast fortune which
will leave 'Nick' in a fight for survival.
This is actually a well-crafted film with a strong story-line, though not being award-worthy it is well worth taking time-out to
watch.

At first I felt as though Pablo Escobar was a misunderstood entity being sought by higher powers in an American attack on the ""Drug War.""  After, I realize he was the epitome of everything wrong with acceptance of legalizing narcotics.  I am moved by this movie and I highly recommend it to others who want something to watch. Something which captures you and makes you want to pay attention.

There is nothing in here that tells that story. Instead it is a pitiful shallow personal drama of the Canadian character with Escobar in the background just to keep things interesting. Even though I like Benicio, he is way too Americanized and Hollywood to play the role of Escobar.

7018786,4,B00TQ4PBBO,"""Escobar: Paradise Lost"" does not tell the entire Pablo Escobar story. For that, see the History Channel's very good documentary called ""Killing Pablo"". However, I viewed this video, ""Escobar: Paradise Lost"", because I wanted to see what Benicio Del Toro did with the role. Also, I had never seen the young actor Josh Hutcherson before, so I thought I would give this video a shot. I was not disappointed as both actors did a great job. I stand by my 4Star rating. It's worth a viewing if you like the actors involved.",1443484800,,518,4.641304347826087

7018814,5,B00TQ4PBBO,Must see movie- Why it's taken so long for Hollywood to bring Escobar onto the big screen is probably exactly related to the content of this film and others coming out. For those to young or completely asleep in in the 80s and on in regards to the cocaine bonanza this is a Drug 101 film and for those who want good acting and a compelling-albeit violent storyline-this film is great. It's hard to believe the American characters are so naive' to the point of utter annoyance.,1443312000,,476,4.482758620689655

7018946,4,B00TQ4PBBO,"Having just watched the series ""Narcos"" on Netflix, I came across this movie and decided to watch it. The two shows are quite similar in some ways, graphically portraying the monster that was Pablo Escobar. This movie was a somewhat different spin, but added another layer of understanding to the depth and depravity of the Colombian cartels. Not a fun show to watch, but educational in a world that seems to have largely accepted illegal drugs as simply a matter of fact in society today. Benicio Del Toro was excellent as Escobar, a frightening portrayal of a man so evil, and yet so clueless about himself. The film is pretty graphic, although no moreso than many violent dramatic films of today. It also gave a sad and painful warning about what can happen when young and naive people, in this case two Canadian brothers, go to a place they know nothing about, and find themselves caught in a trap they cannot escape.",1443052800,,921,4.691358024691358

7018954,1,B00TQ4PBBO,"I'm a huge Benicio del Torro fan, which is why I was excited to see him play Pablo Escobar in this flick. Josh Hutcherson plays the prototypical idealistic/stupid foreigner (gringo) who along with others of his kind decides that drug capital Columbia is the perfect place to set up a surfer camp & storefront food/drink business. Hmmmm if that doesn't already ring a bell, then you're one of the folks that probably gave this movie a high rating. But of course, not long thereafter these group of idealistic white kids start getting harassed by local thugs, which also coincide with Josh's character meeting Maria who just happens to be Pablo Escobar's niece. The courtship phase & character development of the young lovers is omitted from the movie, which means that the audience doesn't get invested in their love, or them for that matter, as the story progresses. Huge problem right there, as the movie isn't over for another 1.5 hours and we don't care enough about the main characters who movie is centered on. If Josh's character was completely in the dark about the dangers of his new ""home"" and terror that locals deal w/ on a daily basis, he gets a quick lesson as he goes into a store to try on a blazer (to look formal to meet Maria's family, thus Escobar, for the first time) as the local thugs burst into the store to show him who/how things are run in those parts by releasing a seemingly rabid dog on him. Message received?!

While del Torro is charismatic & holds this weak movie together, the fact that the bond between him and his nephew-in-law is so poorly developed in the story-telling means that the trust that a person like Escobar would need to allow/embrace this foreigner as a new member of his close-knit family is pretty much ridiculous. I mean, are we really supposed to believe that a man like Escobar would allow his beloved niece to marry a gringo who's not of any socio-economic/political importance but just a random white guy from Canada that's a drifter/lost idealistic type? Even so, if you don't have the stomach to be a tough guy or someone useful in the drug operation then why again would Escobar trust you? While Escobar shows him some kindness by killing the local thugs who released the dog on him, Josh's character is somehow inept or oblivious to the realities of how violence is central to Escobar's lifestyle nor his own complicity to things happening around him. This is important because as the film progresses the moral dilemma's that Josh's character ends up having becomes comically absurd, because what else but being engulfed in violence could come from ""falling in love"" with the niece of a druglord and entering their inner circle?

The weak plot & poor storytelling are the primary reasons why I hated this boy-meets-girl-but-girl-is-related-to-a-dangerous-druglord flick. The lack of character development & editing only furthers it down the ""bad movie"" path. Watching this movie = a complete waste of time & insult to your intelligence!",1442620800,14,2996,4.838206627680312

I doubt that a naive Canadian boy would marry into a narco family like that. Putting aside these grievances, I can say the only redeeming quality of the film was the second half of the movie. It turned into a good suspenseful thriller during the second half of the film. Yet, the characterization is extraordinarily weak and Benecio Del Toro's acting is probably the only redeeming quality of this film.",1442275200,,570,4.88659793814433

7019048,4,B00TQ4PBBO,"There were some gaps in the historical timeline (They glossed over the Cali Cartel almost completely), but Bencio Del Toro was perfect as Pablo Escobar. The somewhat disjointed character development and the relationship development between the main character his girlfriend was really the only flaw; I attribute this to an overzealous editor. The movie captured well how affable and personal Pablo was with the very people he was plotted to kill or have killed, and how far he was willing to go to preserve his organization. Every bit as cold and calculating as Felix Dzerzhinsky, Josef Stalin, Mao Zedong or Pol Pot but far more feral. I loved the movie for it's poignancy. A chilling reminder of just how many died in Columbia just because they were in the wrong place at the wrong time.

7019244,3,B00TQ4PBBO,"I was hoping for a happy ending. Now, that would have made this movie. No complaints whatsoever as far as Del Toro and Hutcherson's acting abilities go. In fact, I thought that they both shone in their individual roles.

  I had read a book some years ago by the true-life brother of Escobar. I could not put it down; it was that interesting and exciting to me. In the movie it shows how the people truly loved this gangsta of Coke and violence. Putting aside the ""nice"" things that Escobar did indeed do for his familia and the general overall poor citizens of Columbia, ... the fact will always remain that the guy was brutal, ruthless, selfish, deranged (eventually), and I think addicted himself to the drug.

  I don't recall from the book if his niece actually did fall in love with the young Canadian man (played by Hutcherson), ... if I missed the beginning written clues before the movie started (I was doing chores around the house), and that this love story between Escobar's niece and the young man, then ... as I stated from the beginning ... this story would have meant much more to me and it would have received ""4"" stars, not three.

  To sum it up, if there is no other movie one evening that you are looking forward to seeing, then watch this one and write what you thought about it. Maybe I am completely wrong and we all share our honest opinions, but when I saw how it was ending, I thought ""you've got to be kidding me; I was pulling for these two young people to overcome everything in this movie and this is how it is ending?"" I was so disappointed; as if I did the Director a favor for the past two hours watching it.",1441411200,,1642,4.357377049180328

Pablo Escobar only cared about 3 things: his family, his money and his power.  He was not interested in how many or who he killed in order to keep his grip on power.

7019463,5,B00TQ4PBBO,Benicia Del Toro played his part perfecto as usual.,1440720000,,51,4.777777777777778
7019464,4,B00TQ4PBBO,"Benicio Del Toro owns the role of Pablo Escobar.  He brings such depth to his portrayal that one can well understand why this sociopath was so well regarded by so many.

The focus of the movie is from the point of view of an outsider pulled into the drug lords extended family through a romantic affiliation with his niece.  Josh Hutcherson portrays Nick, the Canadian surfer, who is unaware of Escobar until falling for his niece.  Nicks growing awareness of Escobars nature as well as his drug empire makes for tense viewing.  We see Escobar as a loving father playing with his own children, while coldly being able to authorize the execution of other peoples children.

Benicio Del Toro gives such a nuanced performance, flawlessly displaying an appealing and paternal facade to the populace and his family while raising chills of horror in the viewer.

I almost skipped this video after seeing the comments about the lack of subtitles.  Perhaps it depends on the method or device one is using to view the video, but I found that between the portions of the audio that were in English and the very clear subtitles and captions for those that were not, it was very well presented.",1440720000,2,1182,4.7317073170731705

I didn't really need to stay up until 2 AM watching it on a work day, but the plot, the actors, the drama, and the suspense kept me enthralled.  If this movie didn't do well at the box office (I never heard of it until now), it surely should have.  Benicio Del Toro is superb as Pablo Escobar, and Joel Hutcherson does a masterful job transforming from a beach bum to a smitten suitor, from a ""family"" member to a hunted man.  I won't give away the ending, but will say it at least avoided an implausible saccharin conclusion.  Watch this movie, you'll be glad to did!",1440374400,11,681,4.2890625

This film and the actors played it to the P.

Like any history good or bad, its still history and Colombia has come a long way and is still making strides in the right direction. That said, I hate when a movie like this becomes some wana-b-gangstas how to guide.

Go visit the actual towns if you want. Turbo is beautiful, as is Medellin. And when you are there go to the typical restaurants and places and ask them about things you think you know about Pablo Escobar to people who lived through Escobar. Im not selling you anything but airfare is dirt cheap to Medellin and other parts of the country right now and the dollar to pesos has never been stronger. Go see the beach in the movie. People there are quite friendly but be careful who you date. LOL!!!",1440374400,18,1188,4.444954128440367

7019840,3,B00TQ4PBBO,"A Romeo and Juliet-like love story entwined in a (stereotypical) Colombian theme, filmed in Panama, with Mexican actors (and accents) posing as Colombian thugs... okay... Could have been worse I guess... but this could have been much more.

While Del Toro's, and Hutcherson's performances were great, and kept the weak plot afloat, the story itself lacked quite a bit of detail and depth to make it seem a bit more believable. The relationship between Maria (Traisac) and Nick (Hutcherson) happened magically overnight (quite unrealistically I might add), making the plot feel very forced, and somewhat absurd in a lot occasions. Some of the thugs had super noticeable Mexican Spanish accents, and there was very little depth to some of the secondary characters that, while brought to life by good acting, ultimately felt short due to the thin plot. Come on, a 15 year old Martin with a wife and kid? Even in Colombia, that's a bit too young!

All in all, it's a good movie, with great acting, and beautifully directed and set, but in the end you're left feeling a bit cheated and unsatisfied by this  directorial debut from Andrea Di Stefano.",1439683200,4,1143,4.9119170984455955

7019873,3,B00TQ4PBBO,"I gave the movie three stars.  The best acting was done by the Benicio Del Toro who played Escobar.  I really don't know if its a true story or not but to tell you the truth I had no sympathy what-so-ever for anyone except perhaps the brother and his family who got caught in the cross-fire due to the affair between his brainless younger brother and the niece of the well known drug czar Escobar. I suppose he was attracted by her looks and the families money and power. His character came across to me as totally insipid and spineless; who basically was a ""boy toy"" and was treated as such throughout the film. His looks didn't help.

I only finished the movie because I started watching it and kept thinking it would get better, but it really didn't.  At least not to me.  So, I gave it three stars for the acting ability of Benicio Del Toro. You may enjoy it and find some merit in the film, I did not.",1439596800,,906,4.244186046511628

7020114,3,B00TQ4PBBO,"This film is an accessible snapshot into the remarkably two-faced Escobar for American viewers, at least if they are English/Spanish bilingual.  I found it worth watching just to see del Toro as Escobar.  If you don't expect much more than that  AND if you speak Spanish, then ""Escobar"" will probably not disappoint.  While I personally enjoyed the bilingual script, this bizarre choice limits the films marketability.

There are already much more thorough, more accurate and equally entertaining recounts of Escobar in Spanish.  Nothing about the trailer or even the promo poster led me to expect rigorous historical accuracy, but the script had some obvious historical gaps that may bother viewers already familiar with the timeline of Escobar's downfall.  For instance, we are transported from 1984, when Escobar was a senator, to 1991, by which time his ruthlessness had been widely exposed.  The real drama and moral dilemmas within his family and ranks occurred during this period, yet the writers chose to jump from ""Paradise"" to ""Lost"".",1439251200,,1044,5.246987951807229

The film depicts the high life provided by the sale of drugs and on the one hand the generosity of the gangster to the poor, and at the same time a murderous self-preservationist who will kill anybody including his own people.  The film includes a young man from Canada who came to Colombia with his brother and his brother's family to surf and have a little business on the beach.  This young man meets the niece of the Gangster Escobar and falls in love with her.  He is welcomed into the family, they become engaged and he is ultimately asked to commit murder of a local hired to help hide diamonds in a cave and dynamite the cave.  Unfortunately, he cannot kill the local and ultimately finds out that he is to be killed as well.  He manages to escape and encounters two of Escobar's men who have been pursuing him and he kills them getting shot himself in the abdomen.  He had previously arranged to meet his love in a church where she finds him wounded and she runs out of the church screaming for help.

And the choice to not use subtitles was a bold move, but it had me paying attention and focusing on the actor's eyes, rather than reading the lines below their chin.  Benicio Del Toro's choices are always original, but he created such a stirring, nuanced character in Pablo Escobar, and there was not enough recognition for his work on this.  Even his accent when Pablo spoke english was done in such an extraordinary way, as Del Toro would emphasize the wrong syllables and change the operative words in sentences we take for granted as english speakers, because that is how we sound when speaking a second language without being completely fluent.

There are some downsides in getting involved with Pablo Escobar's niece especially if you are a gringo who gives surfing lessons. Nick the key character, played by John Hutcherson from the Hunger Games, does a good job for the most part. Benicio Del Toro plays Escabar and comes across as very believable. A lot of Spanish which makes it realistic yet this may not be suitable for some. There are no subtitles that would have helped. Nick, along with his brother and sister in law have plans to live a simple life on a beautiful beach yet there world forever changes when Nick falls in love Escobar's niece.

7020214,4,B00TQ4PBBO,"As ""Escobar: Paradise Lost"" (2014 release from France and Spain; 120 min.) opens, we are told it is ""Medellin, Colombia, June, 1991"". We see Escobar making a phone call to his old mother, informing her he is going to prison tomorrow. On this last night of freedom, Escobar gathers his closest aides, including Nick, and everyone is assigned a particular task to hide the economic wealth of the cartel. Escobar tells Nick that he needs to kill his guide after the loot has been hidden, much to Nick's horror. We then go back ""A Few Years Earlier"", where we see Nick, a Canadian surfer, and his brother Dylan building a surf camp. Nick meets Maria, a beautiful local girl, whom we later learn is related to Escobar (he is Maria's uncle). At this point we're 15 min. into the movie. Will Nick kill the guide? What becomes of Nick and Maria? To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, the movie's main events surrounding Escobar are based on facts, including the historical surrender in 1991. But I have my doubts that the parallel story lines involving Nick and Maria really happened. If they had, we probably would have been told at the beginning that this movie was ""based on true events"" or something like it. Not that this diminishes the enjoyment of the film, as somehow this mix of facts and fiction works great. The relationship between Nick and Maria is fun to watch, in particular as Claudia Traisac (playing Maria) is nothing short of a glowing presence on the big screen, what a delight! Benicio del Toro, portraying Escobar, is a heavy-weight and overpowers everyone, similar to what Marlon Brando did in The Godfather. Josh Hutcherson is okay as Nick. His best moment in the movie is when he and Maria attend a birthday party for Escobar, and along the way Nick comes to the realization of what is really going on and what Escobar does. Priceless! The last 30 min. of the movie provide a nice pay-off and will have you on the edge of your seat.

""Escobar: Paradise Lost"" showed up without any pre-release fanfare or hype at my local art-house theater here in Cincinnati last weekend, and I finally had a chance to check it out. The matinee screening where I saw this at was attended okay but not great. I must say that I was very pleasantly surprised by this movie, which turned out to be much better than what I had expected. If you are in the mood for a tough-as-nails crime drama with several top-notch performances, I encourage you to seek this out, be it in the theater, on Amazon Instant Video or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. STRONGLY RECOMMEDED!",1435968000,44,2658,4.629237288135593
7020215,3,B00TQ4PBBO,"No guy likes to meet his girl's parents. Period. Okay, there may be a few exceptions but those guys are probably crazy. We all get that fear in the back of our mind that her father, or older brother, will give us the ""if you hurt her"" threat/promise to do something awful to us in retaliation. Now imagine that the girl's most dominant male family figure is murderous drug lord Pablo Escobar. How do you think meeting her family would go then? It might go something like it does in Escobar: Paradise Lost, a film about Pablo Escobar that tragically isn't really about Escobar at all even though it really needed to be.

The reason is that the other characters in the film are a total bore, and that includes The Hunger Games star Josh Hutcherson as Nick, a Canadian living the surf life in Colombia. The movie is really about him, and how he gradually enters Escobar's dangerous world simply by falling in love with the man's niece, Maria, played by the lovely Claudia Traisic. Nick is in the country along with his brother (Brady Corbet) and sister-in-law, thinking they've found a little corner of paradise. When Nick meets Maria it's love at first sight, and unfortunately we don't get to really see much of the courtship or much of their relationship at all. Actor-turned-director Andrea Di Stefano seems to be on fast forward getting to an inevitable conflict between Nick and Escobar, so that we never get to see what led up to it. In fact, the story begins by flashing ahead to 1991 on the day Escobar is to turn himself into authorities after a bloody and brutal conflict. He's just asked Nick to do something terrible; hiding Escobar's money in a secluded area then killing anybody who assists him in the task. Can he do it? Will he do it? How the heck does someone like Nick end up in this predicament? Of course it's ridiculous, which may be why Di Stefano doesn't spend too much time on the details.

Jumping back a few years, we're breezed through Nick's meeting with Maria's family, which comes off like a fish-out-of-water comedy with Escobar at its center. We see the vicious kingpin as both a national hero and the family clown; walking around in sweat shorts and Boston Celtics caps, playing in the pool with his kids and basically acting like the most benevolent crime boss ever. Del Toro, who specializes in characters who are slightly out of left field, is masterful in the role because he's not trying to be flashy about it. He's simply captivating and the best reason to see this movie which is pretty average the rest of the way. Hutcherson is solid but Nick has little personality to speak of.  He's not a complete dummy (not yet, anyway), and begins to suspect there's more to Escobar's empire than it seems. When he asks Maria how Escobar made his money she innocently replies ""Cocaine"", before rationalizing why that's perfectly okay.

This would have been a better story if it focused more on Escobar and his tenuous relationship with Nick, an unlikely member of the family if there ever was one. Think of how tense some of the scenes could have gotten as Escobar, who loves Maria dearly, continued to treat Nick with kindness until some later act forces his dark side to emerge. But we don't get that. Instead, Di Stefano has the situation turn on a dime with no explanation at all, simply to get to the final chapter action sequence. Admittedly, Di Stefano does a great job with it, and so does Hutcherson as the simple kid waaaay out of his depth. As he's chased across the countryside by Escobar's goons, Hutcherson is believably terrified, occasionally flashing a look that screams ""How did it come to this?!!?""  Shot in Panama, the scenery is gorgeous all around, and Di Stefano knows how to stage an effectively gripping set piece. He's got a bright future as a director, and clearly knew to give Del Toro the freedom to embody Escobar in his own way. But it's hard not to think how much better this movie would have been if Escobar was the true focus. Escobar: Paradise Lost isn't the biopic on the drug lord people have been hoping for, but it's a decent enough thriller that will probably be remembered for teasing how amazing a true Escobar film could be with Del Toro.",1435968000,18,4209,4.61415220293725
