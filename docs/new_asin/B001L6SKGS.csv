8317473,3,B001L6SKGS,Very pleased with ballet DVD - but DVD of opera Satyagraha never received - heartbroken by this,1481241600,,95,4.647058823529412
8317474,2,B001L6SKGS,"I am not usually one to write a review but I owe it to myself to express my disappointment to this particular ballet production.

I normally get good and accurate reviews and recommendation from others when I bought my DVD from Amazon. In fact, the last one I got was also Cinderella with Royal Birmingham Ballet which I enjoyed very much.

This particular Cinderella danced by Zurich Ballet is the exception.
I had been cautioned that it strays away from the traditional story but that is not why I was so disappointed with it.
I enjoy watching Matthew Bournes productions of the classics with a new twist. So, I was anticipating the same. Little did I know then how much this particular production displeases me.

First of all, the story line. We are supposedly to believe that Cinderellas father, who was married to a ballerina, would remarried to someone that looks like a man and dances like a man.

With the role of the fairy godmother gone, replaced by a ballet mistress, the whole story becomes less believable.
The step mother and the two ugly step-sisters were danced by men to create comic moments in the ballet. There is nothing wrong with the ideal but it certainly does not work well in this production. It reminds me of the someone imitating the Ballet Trockadero and failed.

I had watched it once but never again. I guess it will end up in the garbage one day when I feel less guilty about wasting my money on it
.
The choreography was un-inspiring and the costumes were simply un-imaginitive. The camera work and editing for the DVD was dreadful. At times, the framing of the dance cut off the dancers feet and/or the dancers head.
Then there are  moments the camera was behind the stage obstructed by other dancers when filming Cinderella dancing with the Prince.
Then there are the transitions of  scenes where they use a circle to fade in and fade out of a scene. Its so amateurish, what were they thinking?

Now that I vented my displeasure, I feel it is my obligation to warn others. If you are a die hard fan of modern interpretation of a classic ballet, try Rudolf Nureyev's version with the Paris Opera Ballet. At least I can watch that one more than once!",1388361600,2,2182,4.576923076923077
8317475,4,B001L6SKGS,"This version of Cinderella strays quite a way away from the traditional story while retaining much of the original concept. In this case the prince is changed into the role of a star dancer who is looking for a new partner who will have all the required attributes. Briefly, the revised story is as follows:

Currently Cinderella, a trainee star ballerina previously taught by her now deceased mother, is a member of a ballet school where the star dancer favours two prot&eacute;g&eacute;es of lesser ability over Cinderella in order to emphasise her own superiority. These three roles would normally be Cinderella's stepmother and step-sisters. Cinderella is supported solely by the ballet mistress who takes on the role normally taken by the fairy godmother. Eventually Cinderella is able to attend the Gala dance event, dances with the star dancer, leaves at midnight and is eventually found and partnered by the star dancer after much searching amongst international ballet companies. Her opponents are thus defeated. In this way the basic concepts of the story are maintained in a very different context.

The roles normally taken by the stepmother and step-sisters are extremely skilfully danced by three men - Josef Varga, Nicholas Blanc and Francois Petit. There is a great deal of humour exhibited by these men where their dancing errors are surrounded by much 'good' dancing. As a result they can be seen as 'nearly' good and certainly not just silly. This is close to pantomime and will greatly appeal to those who like such slapstick. It is hard to envisage a better way of delivering this concept which is remarkably tastefully built into the ballet to provide moments of light relief rather than the usual unpleasantness of the step-sisters and stepmother. The Zurich audience clearly enjoyed the experience.

The lead roles of Cinderella, taken by Karine Seneca, and Frederic, the star dancer taken by Stanislav Jermakov, are very well done indeed. The corps de ballet are equally up to the demands of the production. The tributes to the Bolshoi, Paris and Royal Ballet companies in the 'searching' section in act 2 are skilfully done too - well enough to be recognisably in style.

The orchestral contribution under the renowned Russian conductor Fedoseyev is totally authentic and well performed. The recording delivers crisp imaging without movement blur. The camera work is sympathetic to the concept and is a little freer in some of the shots than might be appropriate in a more traditional production. I see this as a somewhat fantastical concept with some added humour so it seems reasonable for the camera work and editing to mirror this freedom. The sound on my equipment offers exceptionally wide ranging DTS 5.1 sound as well as stereo.

A more traditional and perhaps safer bet may be the version by the Birmingham Ballet which also has the advantage of being available as a Blu-ray. However admirers of Spoerli, the choreographer at Zurich here under consideration, need not have any reason to hesitate.

I have now watched this version many times and have continued to enjoy it greatly on each occasion but on its own terms. Assessment of this production therefore seems to be more a matter of taste and expectation rather than one of quality of execution.

In conclusion therefore, I would therefore suggest that the Birmingham version warrants serious consideration as a fine and safe traditional performance. I would then suggest that this Zurich version could then be considered as a possible interesting alternative. I would not suggest it as an 'only' version as it strays too far from the expected story.

Interesting review of an unusual Production!

My Retirement Home Audiences are besotted with the Blu-Ray of the Birmingham Royal Ballet version, and I have to agree with them - brilliant Costumes, Sets, Dancing, Acting and lots of understated AND overstated Humour - just delightful!! Thank you for recommending it.... (U.K. review)",1342396800,,4086,5.157099697885196
8317476,4,B001L6SKGS,"I cannot let a 2 star review stand alone--it is patently and pretentiously unfair. First, I am interested primarily in the music, the dancing is secondary. Fedoseyev gets better with age. Don't believe me? Try his 'swan lake' at Zurich. It is mainly for Fedoseyev that you should get this, with the Zurich opera orchestra playing like a front-rank SO. Without great PCM sound, that playing would be lost, but BelAir (despite relatively low production values generally) always gets the (stereo) sound right. But the dancing is very fine, too. In case you have not noticed, Zurich is now the best ballet company in the world. So as to Sommer and the crazy video direction: yes, it is awful, but not all the time, not even most of the time. But BelAir should re-edit this and cut all the gimmicks. For those allergic to homoerotic ballet stagings (getting more and more common, if not more and more popular), Spoerli manages to make both sisters travesti roles. Still, much less obnoxious than his attempt to turn Peer Gynt into a man of the cloth. He more or less turns this into a farce. I have many versions of 'Cinderella' on CD (complete, cut, piano reductions, etc) and Fedoseyev turns in the best version. If you can get by some stupid video tricks, you will enjoy this very much.",1288742400,7,1284,4.6607929515418505
8317477,2,B001L6SKGS,"This is not a movie, this is a ballet performed on a stage, and should be presented as such.  Much of the choreography was interrupted by a camera constantly moving, and often directed on the dancers faces or feet, and in many ensemble scenes the camera would focus  on only a few dancers instead of letting us enjoy the movements of all the dancers.  It was infuriating.  What a pity.  These are great artists whose work could not be fully appreciated.  The entire production was worthy - costumes, sets and lighting.  The orchestra too was lush and the sound utterly sumptuous.  Someone should have put the camera on a tripod and told the cameraman to get lost.  Because of the constant movements of the camera there was little sense of the ballet as theater. It is a pity that the producer didn't see fit to make us part of the audience, to take us in from the 'strada', into the lobby, and into our seats, and, as well giving us a glimpse at what it is like for the dancers prior to the performance.  Nor was there enough about the people who mounted this great production. Shame!  What  a waste. Not recommended.

A final note.  The Zurich audience must be on Valium.  In New York City they would have been cheering wildly at these remarkable dancers.",1244851200,10,1256,4.495575221238938
