2160642,5,B00062IZ40,"In this DVD, Dr. Atkins clearly explains the health and weight loss benefits of his famous eating plan known as the Atkins Diet.

My wife has been following the plan for a week and a half and has lost two and a half pounds and an inch off her waist.

For [people who enjoy tasty food, this eating plan is a real winner.

The DVD and accompanying printed guide clearly lay out the plan in an easy and straight-forward manner.

I highly recommend this programme for people who are quite overweight and in despair about finding a way out.",1305849600,5,535,4.373737373737374
2160643,5,B00062IZ40,"The Atkins complete deluxe edition, originally was a (2)set VHS video in it's first production. This DVD contains the original video and includes additional material in an expanded version. Dr. Atkins presents the information as if you were visiting his office and it's very well produced, interesting and entertaining. Understanding concepts of carbohydrates, hidden sugar, and a program for weight loss and healthy eating are presented in a easy to follow program. It also comes with a Carbohydrate Counter & Personal Diet manual. The video includes testimonials from his weight loss patients, a tour of the Atkins NY Clinic and even a Question and Answer section with members of his staff. In a world of ""imitators"" I have found that the basis for most of todays ""weight loss"" systems are founded in the low carb life style originally made popular by Dr. Robert Atkins, because... it works!",1296691200,8,893,5.081632653061225
2160644,5,B00062IZ40,"I am not the type to sit down and spend a couple weeks reading a book before I start a diet (waste of time). This DVD helped me really understand how and why the diet works (I was a little skeptical). Dr. Atkins goes into some detail in the video on the specifics, the rest is in the personal diet manual included.

The other thing I really like is the pocket sized Carb Counter that is inside. I can never remember what I can and can't eat. It's very helpful when I go out to eat and has over 1000 foods in it.",1101686400,15,511,3.9611650485436893

8037086,1,B00062IZ40,This CD from Bridge Media did not come as advertised.  I contacted Bridge Media and received  no response. In addition Bridge Media did not include any return paperwork or information so I will have to absorb the cost to return this item to Bridge Media. I can only say buyer beware when ordering from Bridge Media.,1486252800,,315,4.607142857142857
8037087,5,B00062IZ40,"Very reasonably priced and very well done video by the late,  great, original low carb author, Dr. Robert Atkins!  I've had this dvd for awhile and find that when I need to refresh the diet or be inspired I just drop in this video and their I am face to face with the man himself! He presents his program in simple language which makes it very easy to follow! I'm so happy that Dr. Atkins was able to leave us with this video before his way to soon passing! May you rest in eternal peace Dr. Atkins in knowing that you helped millions of people with their weight and health problems while you were alive and will continue to help millions more through this video and your books as time goes on!",1457136000,,694,4.25
