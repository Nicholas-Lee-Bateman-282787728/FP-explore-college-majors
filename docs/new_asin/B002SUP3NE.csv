3982329,3,B002SUP3NE,"i hate brainless heroes who seem befuddled from beginning to end - this one even comes up with a plan that shows a incredible lack of foresight - no - not that stupid plan - the one while in Paradise - sure he wins in the end  - but not due to cleverness - but due to audience expectations

i hope the B-western dialog wasn't lifted from the novel - eg - ""you don't believe me, do you"" - when everything he's done up to then contradicts his claim - and the ending tries to wrap up the story with the most sappy dialog ever - there are a some fresh lines of dialog - but they're few and far between

at least there are a couple good plot points in this mess - the twist with the marshal - the cross confrontations at the end - and the whole thing moves fast - so fast that i'll give my rating an extra star

the direction is functional - no more - but there's some above average acting - Audie isn't his usual amiable self - instead he's edgy due to the constant pressure his character is under - consequently Audie's performance is a little better than usual - Steven McNalley oozes his usual menace - Robert Middleton livens things up in a good scene - then there's Felicia Farr - who is much better than the typical B western leading lady - and she's prettier and more alluring than I'm accustomed to seeing her

if you don't mind a frustratingly dumb hero - and a B level script that moves at a gallop - this will probably do for you",1350777600,,1436,4.096085409252669
3982330,5,B002SUP3NE,"This is a non-standard review of this movie, as ""Hell Bent For Leather"" and ""Column South"" , two classic Audie Murphy westerns, both with wonderful widescreen vistas are only available in the European PAL DVD standard.

Both of these movies' copyrights are owned by Universal International Pictures. I have run this company's name through my favorite search engine and discovered their email ""contact"". I have followed up with two separate email pleas for them to remaster and release both of these treasures in the USA on DVD and Blu-Ray.

Both movies are well acted, have great storylines and are in danger of being lost to future American generations unless they are finally given their due respect.

It is almost criminal the French offer these westerns, but are nowhere to be found in the country of his birth. Please join me in following my lead and email Universal International Pictures too.

If only I could purchase a remastered DVD or Blu-Ray of these westerns, I'd amend this with my observations about their quality of remastering skills and more details of each storyline.

I encourage you to follow my lead and send them an email asking they do the right thing too. Maybe they'll get the message if enough of you do the same.

8379635,5,B002SUP3NE,"This review is only for the movie, not the DVD.  Excellent Audie Murphy western.  A hunted killer manages to trade identities with our Audie, so Murphy is now The Wrong Man being chased by angry townsfolk into the mountains.  Heading the posse is a yellow-belly lawman who doesn't care what man he gets, just so he's seen to be doing his job and labeled a hero.  Aiding Murphy is an outcast young woman.  The desert locales are magnificent.  WHEN is this film going to be released to US DVD or DVD-R.  Highly recommended.",1455494400,,521,4.537634408602151
8379636,5,B002SUP3NE,I wish that this great movie could be available to play on North American players; as well as some other Audie Murphy westerns that will only work in a Region 2 player! I would be the first of many customers to order them!!,1452038400,,223,4.209302325581396
