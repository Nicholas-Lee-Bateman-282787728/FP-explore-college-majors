8334656,4,B001O1RYFI,"My daughter loves ""Franny's Feet"" on PBS KIDS. For her third birthday, I was checking into possible ""Franny"" gift ideas for her. I came acrossed this dvd, and after reading the title, I thought it would be nice for my daughter to watch an episode that would involve ""Franny"" being a princess. None of the episodes feature ""Franny"" as a princess. The scene depicted on the cover is no where in the episodes. The closest thing shown on the dvd would be an episode where ""Franny"" meets an Egyptian princess named Tia, but at no point, is there a ""Princess Franny"". So I was disappointed that the dvd didn't include at least one episode that was about what I thought it was about. I gave this a rating of 4 stars though because it is a cute dvd. I believe that ""Franny's Feet"" is a good show for kids, and it's nice to be able to play the episodes whenever convenient. From my experience, you can't really find Franny stuff in stores, so I was happy to find this on Amazon.",1305417600,2,969,4.359116022099448
