4570595,4,B0054PSXXM,"Sweatshop is a new slasher flick just in time for Halloween. The first half is just merely decent, but trust me that by the end of this movie you'll be thinking this movie rocks. Well, if you are a fan of gory slasher movies, anyway. It really reminded of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, only set at a rave. Some of the dialogue is actually funny, in a profane way. The movie is a gorefest, too. Too bad we never find out the origin of the killers or who they are. Maybe in the sequel. Sweatshop is simply a cool hardcore horror film, despite its flaws.",1317600000,4,550,4.247619047619048

Let's now get down to the point. THIS MOVIE SUCKS! Looks great, trailer hooks ya, line, sinker, and all. Lots of buzz, etc. I'm not even going to get into it but trust me, most of you will hate this do*chbag of a so called ""film"". OMG, it's just pathetic.

4570597,3,B0054PSXXM,"So, Im a huge movie guy, especially horror.  I have never felt compelled to write a review but this needed to be said.  The actors are about as irritating as any I have ever seen.  I realize that this is a slasher film with paper thin characters and we aren't always treated to the luxury of having a great deal of interest or personal attachment to said characters.  We have all cheered on Jason and Freddy to take out the generic characters.  The difference with sweatshop is that the actors hurt your eyes and ears, you pray for their deaths.  The gore however is incredible.  The special effects for this indie piece where well worth watching it for.  Some deaths are completely unseen before while there are some that are kind of an homage to other slashers.  So before you say this guy doesnt know indie horror, please know that my shelves are stocked full with many unheard of gems.  This one should be unheard of.  The awesome effects are what carried it.  Effects earned all 3 of these stars.",1315699200,16,1001,4.5
4570598,4,B0054PSXXM,"That goes for both the storyline of SWEATSHOP and my opinion of it, so be warned! After seeing writer/director Stacy Davidson's inventive and ambitious DOMAIN OF THE DAMNED, I was looking forward to the follow-up, and that sophomore feature, SWEATSHOP, does NOT disappoint. If you were expecting a heart-wrenching drama about illegal child labor slaves from the title, get ready for a nasty shock. Well, actually, a BUNCH of them. Hearkening back to the extra-gory slasher classics of the mid-80's to early '90's, it's an unapologetic, splatterific E-ticket ride into Hemoglobin Hell, so if you're from the ""Masterpiece Theater"" crowd, I recommend you stick to PBS.

As it was with such classics as the original FRIDAY THE 13TH, HALLOWEEN and the like, the plot is pretty straighforward. A group of entrepreneurial ravers are doing what they do best: scoping out an abandoned property to set up their latest shindig, make a crapload of money and then make like sheep and get the flock outta Dodge. The only risk with squatting on someone else's space, even temporarily, is that you're bound to piss somebody off. And the 'somebody' who inhabits the warehouse (or is that ""WERE-house?"") that the group has selected is one bad mofo, who walks softly and carries the BIGGEST EFFING STICK you ever saw in your life. One that has an anvil attached to it. Trust me, friends...that previous sentence is NOT a typo. And if you think THAT'S something, you should see what this monster (known affectionately as ""THE BEAST"") does with it. Hint: You will never hear the song 'Monster Mash' the same way again after seeing SWEATSHOP.

Unlike other indie horror filmmakers who fall into the ""Second Feature Slump"", Davidson has pulled out all the stops here, with a great ensemble cast, amazing art direction, some unbelievable special FX (courtesy of the wizards at Oddtopsy - a group that could be the next KNB Studios!) and a villain that could take his (its?) rightful place in the canon of such notable nightmare specialists as Leatherface, the cannibal mutants from THE HILLS HAVE EYES and memorable icons like The Tall Man and the demonic force known as ""The CREEPER"" from JEEPERS CREEPERS.

There's a lot of crap floating around out there from so-called indie horror filmmakers, most of it ready to be flushed down the nearest crapper. Not THIS baby! I will be proud to place my copy of SWEATSHOP on my DVD library shelf right next to SLITHER and SUSPIRIA. And if you are a rabid fan like myself, you will be, too.",1309392000,10,2508,4.855140186915888
4570599,3,B0054PSXXM,Was very bloody and the characters were ditzy! It was kinda scary but i really didn't like the ending. Still ok for a B movie.,1472083200,,126,4.08
4570600,4,B0054PSXXM,"Charlie (Ashley Kay) and her friends break into an abandoned foundry; they plan to host a secret midnight rave and charge admission.  Unfortunately, this foundry, which contains a lot of industrial equipment, is the home of three murderous creatures.  The lead one, a giant, wears filthy furs and a welders mask and carries an enormous foundry hammer; he is accompanied by two females who look like demons with their razor-sharp teeth and long, stringy black hair.  Charlies friends are obnoxious, sex-crazed Goths with tattoos and piercings galore.  One by one they die horribly gruesome deaths, some of which fall into the category of torture porn.

  The actors are unattractive, which is good, because it adds a dimension of realism to the film.  They look like actual people and not the beautiful, preppy, wholesome types that populated the slasher flicks of the eighties.  The acting in Sweatshop exceeded my expectations.  Most of the characters were amoral and obnoxious, which made me unsympathetic towards their plight.  Some of the killings were extremely gruesome and surprisingly creative.  This movie definitely has a high body count.  A massacre occurs at the end which sends the body count soaring through the roof.  It was reminiscent of the massacre that occurs in Hellraiser 3:  Hell on Earth when Pin Head slaughters everyone in a night club.

  Dont pass on this film if you enjoy slasher flicks with a lot of death and gore.  Many plot questions are left unanswered, which is good; it adds a sense of mystery and could lead to a sequel.  If only the killer had a name.  The streaming video was presented in excellent widescreen HD with English captions.  If this is a low budget film, I wouldnt have known it.  The setting of the cluttered, filthy foundry, with its vast assortment of cutting tools, is quite chilling.  Throw in chained doors and a gathering of Goths and you have a recipe for disaster.  One thing I didn't like was the overabundance of foul language, especially in regards to oral sex.  Also, there was too much drama involving sexual preferences and who is having sex with whom.  Nevertheless, Sweatshop is enjoyable late-night slasher fare.",1470873600,,2182,4.955801104972376

This is the BEST bad movie I've ever seen !  It's mysterious & eerie, stupid, funny & sometimes silly. It's also seriously frightening, very scary,  gross & totally degusting. It's also totally entertaining.

There was a huge, dark deserted warehouse,  filled with crates, pipes and junk.  It had all the expected ""teenage"" goth, punk want-a-be's and rednecks in (& out of) outrageous costumes. It had good ""BAD"" music, lots of boobs, some butts and a few sexy scenes. Best of all it had a  giant bad-guy man-monster that you never actually get to see, who turned every tool you can think of into a weapon, and he just loves to cut, slice, filet, torcher, dismember and squash anyone he can find.  His favorite weapon is a huge anvil-hammer, and it was GROSS !!!

4570623,1,B0054PSXXM,"Just a complete and utter waste of time.  I am willing to overlook a lot when it comes to horror films, because I'm a junkie and I need my regular fix.  Sometimes the cheese is what makes an otherwise unbearable movie fun.  In this case, the filmmakers bypassed cheese altogether and just skipped straight to suck.  I knew I was in trouble within the first few minutes, because in that time, the director shot in roughly 712 different camera angles.  I'm sure the goal was to be spooky and set a mood, but unless the desired mood for the audience was ""annoyed,"" it was a total fail.  Next let's introduce a cop whose vocabulary seems to be limited to 4-letter words.  Huh, that worked well.  Why don't we just have every character swear nonstop.  Ooh, edgy!  Throw in some ugly Goths, some gross rednecks and a ton of gore.  Well, shoot, now we've blown our entire budget.  Aww, no money left for a script.  That's okay!  We'll just add another killer or two.  Maybe there were more.  I don't know.  I couldn't tell thanks to the sucktacular editing.  Seriously, even watching this for free through Prime, I feel like I should ask for a refund.  I at least have to give props to the makeup and effects people.  I hope they go on to have great careers working on films with plots, directed by people whose film background is more extensive than watching crap on YouTube.  Trust me.  Just imagine what it would be like watching a movie shot by a four year old with ADD, and you've got the Sweatshop experience without sacrificing any time better spent eating lead paint chips.",1405296000,3,1574,4.50709219858156

4570637,2,B0054PSXXM,"This movie is difficult for me to describe properly.  I will try my best, tho.

Firstly, it takes so LOOOOOONG to get going that I almost fell asleep.  At a few points I almost bailed out.  The characters are not really likable nor interesting. They are the typical stereotypical BORING goths.  *yawn*  But, to ratch things up, they began to partially strip, use all sorts of foul language and dance, dance, dance, and dance some more.  For people who supposedly have a ""lot of shit to do"" (per one of the characters) they did NOTHING for what seemed forever except dance, dance, strip, drink, and dance some more.

Spoilerish but not totally -

It got mildly better when one of the main characters got captured by some of the ""women"" in the warehouse.  Even tho she was being dragged and her kicking on the floor was obvious that she was HELPING them drag her was silly, I can forgive that.

But after that, almost all of the torture parts are silly.  Not that they aren't well done in most parts; they are.  But the REACTIONS were way too over the top!  Ahem...let me correct that statement.  They were NON-REACTIONS.  People who have digits cut off, limbs mutilated, and so on, faint from shock.  They turn grey.  They lose lots of blood.  In this film, even tho blood and gore are shown, the people who survived for a time was just implausible.  I expect that even for an Indie Film that SOME realism be added.

Please, at least put grey makeup on the actors!  Black under their eyes, a lot of sweat and realistic screaming or...SOMETHING!  People don't just lose limbs (especially ""male"" ones) and can sit relatively calmly and continue talking.  That is just...WOW.  BAD.

End spoilerish -

The filming and effects really did pick up about a half hour to the end.  It went from amateur stupid time to a bit of suspense.  The killer was never explained at all, and neither were the presence of the ""women,"" but at least the scenes of chasing and killing were ramped up quite a bit.  Even the camera work was better and much more effective from what was happening in one end of the warehouse to the other.  The switches were done very well.  I began to wake up a bit.

All in all, this is a BAD film and I won't watch it again.  I only recommend it for people who want to see how a movie can begin so slowly and terribly and repetitively and then FINALLY start to move forward.  A bit.

The ending is rather cute.  That's a weird word to use for a horror/gore film, but it really is.  It made me smile.  The official end before the credits roll was stupid and unrealistic (again) but when all the sounds stopped and the main character just...well, I guess that's a spoiler.  Altho it is not really unexpected.  Just her timing.  LOL!

But during the credits is a sort of cute scene, then at the very end.  Not great, but it does add a few touches of levity for those who are easily grossed out.  :)",1375747200,3,2902,4.402646502835538

4570640,4,B0054PSXXM,"SWEATSHOP (2010) - This Texas-lensed regional horror flick is truly one of the goriest films I have seen in many years, but if you are looking for sympathetic characters you can identify with or root for, look somewhere else. The premise is simple: A group of chain-smoking, beer-drinking, drug-taking, lollypop-sucking, body-pierced punkers break into an abandoned warehouse and set up for a rave they plan to throw later that night. Unfortunately, the warehouse is not as empty as they expected. It is infested with four ghoul-like females and a hulking welding mask-wearing killer known as ""The Beast"" (Jeremy Sumrall), who wields a heavy hammer made out of an anvil attached to a pipe, a pair of sharp garden shears, razor wire and other weapons of death. The group, headed by Charlie (Ashley Kay), begin setting up the lighting, DJ booth and sound system (not to mention a ""Makeout Room"", where Charlie pimps out two girls as whores for anyone who is willing to pay the price), while The Beast begins dispatching the group one-by-one in various extreme bloody ways (nothing is left to the imagination). Lighting girl Kim (Danielle Jones) is tied to a table with the razor wire and has the lower half of her body crushed with the anvil hammer, stripping the skin off both of her legs (she survives, but has her head crushed with the hammer as she tries to crawl away later in the film). Kenny (Vincent Guerrero) is decapitated at his jawline while Charlie is giving him a blowjob in her car and when Charlie escapes, she accidentally puts her hand in Kenny's bloody stump and then falls out of the car, landing on the top half of Kenny's head (people who get queasy easy should turn away). Jade (Melanie Donihoo) tries to escape from the ghoul girls in a warehouse elevator, only to have her head crushed through the elevator's door grate by The Beast's hammer. Scottyboy (Peyton Wetzel, easily the most interesting character in the film for reasons I'll explain later) is impaled through the neck by the garden shears, only to have The Beast grab the handles and suddenly open them, instantly cutting off Scottyboy's head. There is plenty more extreme gore on view, so if you're a fan of 80's-styled slasher films, I'll leave them for you to discover, including an unexpected bloody massacre of the patrons that show up for the rave.  Director/co-producer/co-writer/cinematographer/editor/visual effects supervisor Stacy Davidson (DOMAIN OF THE DAMNED - 2007) has fashioned a film that's a gore lover's dream, but he and co-writer Ted Geoghegan (who co-wrote the screenplays to the gore-soaked films BARRICADE - 2006 and DON'T WAKE THE DEAD - 2008) have underwritten most of the characters, except for spiked-mohawked Scottyboy and his older brother, the straight-laced, but mean, Wade (Brent D. Himes, who looks like a slightly less obese John Goodman wearing a trucker's cap). Scottyboy loves to receive oral sex, but can't stand to be ""snowballed"" (Google it) or perform oral sex on a female, so when fellow punker Miko (Julin) makes a bet with him to perform oral sex on her and he loses the bet, she tries to force him to perform oral sex, only to have The Beast crush Miko's body with his hammer while she is standing (one of the film's most upchucking moments). Wade is nothing but a big redneck bully who gets drunk on beer and tries to have sex with Kim while she is tied to the table, failing to notice that Kim's legs are nothing but bloody bones. He fails to deliver the goods because he is too drunk, but The Beast thrusts two spikes under Wade's chin and razor wires him to a table with his brother and Charlie (his fate is still left in the air when the film ends, the only cast member we don't find out who lives or dies). Hey, if you like wall-to-wall gore that is very well done and filmed professionally, this film is for you. If you want a plot to go with it (we really have no idea how The Beast or the ghoul girls claimed this warehouse as their own, as none of them are given a backstory), look somewhere else. Let's just say that the film doesn't have any lofty goals and delivers the goods to the audience it was made for, that being gorehounds. I liked SWEATSHOP for what it was and it never bored me, even if some of the music seemed out of place for a rave. Filmed in 2008 and 2009, but it bears a 2010 copyright during the closing credits. Also starring Naika Malveaux, Krystal Freeman, ViVi Sterling and Fangoria managing editor Michael Gingold as a cop who shoots and kills an innocent girl as she tries to escape The Beast in the beginning of the film. Star Ashley Kay also portrays one of the ghoul girls, but I'll be damned if I could recognise her. Stacy Davidson also worked as producer/cinematographer/editor/visual effects supervisor on director/writer Larry Wade Carrell's highly-regarded Texas-made indie horror film JACOB (2011), which also features some of this film's actors. A Screen Media Films DVD Release. Not Rated and rightfully so.",1373155200,2,4986,4.750865051903114

4570642,3,B0054PSXXM,"Somewhere, someone said: ""Okay, let's find an old, abandoned warehouse, fill it w/ annoying, expendable young people, and kill them off in horrible ways!"" ""Oh yeah, and let's bring in a hillbilly half-wit, and a huge, ugly guy w/ the world's biggest hammer!"" Yep, you've got your basic elements right there. SWEATSHOP explores a man, his sledge-o-matic, and the punks he pulverizes. In between homicides, there is only pointless chatter, nudity, and rave-party decorating. Unfortunately, these in-between times seem pretty long! Once the actual bodily destruction begins, things pick up considerably. Gorehundts can rejoice, as the splatter quotient is high! The BEAST and his girlfriends do their best to eliminate the intruders by means most grisly! Anyone looking for anything other than a squishy bloodbath had better look elsewhere!...",1364428800,,840,5.51937984496124
4570643,1,B0054PSXXM,"As a fan of the horror genre, I half expect to be disappointed with a lot of the ""scary movies"" nowadays, but nothing could have prepared me for this.  I decided to watch this movie after reading the 3 previous reviews, but after having viewed it, I've come to the conclusion that those reviewers actually had roles in this movie.

The movie lacked a plot, character development, suspense, cohesion, good acting and so many other things.  The movie is piece-meal bits of poor acting in scenes with no substance which are unrelated to one another.  It was like a series of terrible shorts stitched together with one common villain whom we know nothing about.  The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that the gore was good.

This video (I cannot, in good conscience, call it a movie any longer) has turned me off to all low-budget horror forever.  Save yourself the two hours and watch something that at least tells a story.",1362873600,10,937,4.608433734939759
4570644,5,B0054PSXXM,"I almost didn't watch this because of the review. Boy am I glad I caught this one! Very fast paced and at one point I spilled my tea because I was so scared I jumped in my seat. It is pretty gory, but well worth the watch. Considering all the duds in horror I have seen lately, I have got to say this really woke me up and got me watching. My eyes were glued to computer screen! Action packed. Give it a few at the beginning, but well worth the watch.",1362528000,,451,3.9130434782608696
4570645,3,B0054PSXXM,"While the title and subject matter was a little unique and made me almost not buy the movie.

4570646,4,B0054PSXXM,"For a brute horror, it was a fresh mix of youth, music, rave, sexuality, suspense, zombie, depravity, horror and gore.  Why the horror was never explained, but entertaining without.  A definite watch.",1361577600,2,200,5.21875
4570647,4,B0054PSXXM,"Sweatshop was a bit slow to start but I got into some of the crazy raved out characters and then got into the movie itself .
Then came the incredible old fashioned non CGI gore,It was off the chain and plentiful.
The main villain is a welders mask wearing, giant hammer welding beast and he had two Demon-esque women as his protegees and they looked way cool and the makeup was amazing.

Simple plot,people go into warehouse to set up a rave and get picked off by the creatures mainly the big dude with the hammer, but he doesn't just use a hammer ,he uses garden shears,a machete, knives and many other killing instruments, in the last scene he goes through the rave just bashing the ravers with the giant hammer and it's a complete gore fest.

There are some interesting things going on with the characters involving sex ,territorial women and revenge against one that gets in on with the wrong chick. I have to have this one. It had a cool soundtrack as well. Plus I'm a sucker for a Disco Ball Covered on Blood.",1351296000,8,1015,4.422459893048129
4570648,4,B0054PSXXM,"What can I say, Sweatshop is alot of bloody gory goodness, I personally love these obscure fun splatter flix. I found this film while surfing Amazon for other titles, the cover art and the average star reviews caught my eye so I started reading the reviews, it sounded right up my alley and I was NOT dissapointed, the kills were excellent, my personal fave was the first one involving the gothy lezbo....NICE!. This film was made  for the gorehounds like myself,I hope they are planning a sequel and up the gore some more and also explain just a bit about who these maniacs are and how they got there, the ending left it wide open for sure. Other than the glorious gore I enjoyed the whole film,of course the acting wasn't the best, but it didn't matter to me, it gave me enough about them to keep me interested. So if you love just having a good time with a horror film and don't take it seriously but also want lots of the red stuff then this one is for you.....have fun at the rave.",1333065600,,986,4.3297297297297295
8456907,3,B0054PSXXM,"There is a pretty cool little slasher/paranormal film hidden inside Sweatshop, but damn if I could find it in this mess. If you are prone to seizures, avoid this film at all costs. The directing and editing are HIGHLY ANNOYING and completely ruined this film for me. First off, everything seems to have been filmed in extreme close-up and through the use of color filters. When done in more capable hands, these types of things can be pulled off, but here they simply serve to annoy the living hell out of you to the point where you have NO CLUE whats going on in any particular scene. Add to that, the use of jittering, out-of-focus shots, shaky hand-held camerawork, etc., that have all been done to death already, and you have yourself a nice little headache by the end. There is also some bizarre dubbing on the voice tracks, which make the film seem ultra cheap. On the positive side, the kill scenes are pretty good! Some entertaining and well-done, gory kills are cool to see and the main killer cuts a rather imposing figure. His henchmen (?) are pulled straight from the film DEMONS (and I mean right down to the exact same makeup) but seem rather weak and serve no real purpose at any time. If you can handle the annoying directing and the 1000-cuts-per-minute editing style, give it a watch.",1521590400,,1302,4.592274678111588
