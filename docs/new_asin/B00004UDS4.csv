7923888,5,B00004UDS4,"I really disliked math in high school. It was a difficult subject to master. With this video, I can take it step by step. It is broken down for me to understand it. If I don't grasp it? Simple-I press rewind. Having the convenience of rewinding it until I grasp it. This DVD is a MUST for anyone having a hard time with algebra. I am more than pleased with my purchase.",1282348800,,369,4.138888888888889
