8685044,2,B00OUF4SBS,"I've never written a review before, but something about this play was a little troubling to me - the domestic abuse. Not so much as domestic abuse does not exist, but the fact that it wasn't properly addressed when it did occurred. I wouldn't want my daughter or any of my nieces to think, for a fraction of second, that it is OK for a man or anyone else to physically abuse them, because it's not. Yet, in the play, it happened at least two times and was never addressed.  I think that the play should have included some form of repercussions for those actions - especially when it happened more than one time.  Perhaps I fast-forwarded past them addressing the abuse incidents and the perpetrator being punished for it.  At least I hope I did. Other than that, the play was OK.",1430524800,,779,4.433566433566433
