8201347,5,B000RMJ4D0,"I loved this video.. I actually got it from the library and am now going to buy it.  It's a short 30 - 35 minute workout that's not too strenuous but not too easy either. I am a bit out of shape, I dropped my yoga practice about 6 months ago and now in my first trimester I am trying to get back into it.
The exercises include a lot of hip openers and easy exercises that repeat a lot so that you get a good workout even though it's not strenuous.  There is a lot of stretching and exercises I feel will tone my arms (and they will probably be a little sore tomorrow).
I found it very relaxing, helpful to my stiff muscles and also I liked the chanting (just a little at beginning and end).  I felt very connected to my baby and within myself and after doing this video, I feel more calm and happy.
It's a very stark background focusing just on exercise- I found the production quality fine, I think it's stark so that you focus on within.
I really really enjoyed it. I'm definitely going to use this a lot - it's great that it's short for busier days too.",1287014400,,1056,4.091787439613527
8201348,2,B000RMJ4D0,"The production quality was amazingly shoddy - the soundtrack popped and the volume jumped at odd moments. I could barely listen to the chanting sections - ouch! And why all the panning shots of the bleak brick wall behind them?

Worse than that, though, I had little confidence in the instructor's knowledge. Some of the directions she gave were in direct contrast to ones I heard from other Yoga teachers - all that bouncing on the joints and tendons seemed like a bad idea, so I just held the poses and breathed. The ""relaxation"" section, which I assume was supposed to stand in for Shivasana, lasted 5 seconds! Also, there was no discussion at all about Kundalini Yoga - the instruction did include some chanting and translation of the Sanskrit, but a very sketchy explanation of what the point was of saying it.

I would not recommend this DVD at all. It just made me feel confused and self conscious. You can find a better one. I guarantee it!",1249689600,,948,4.603550295857988
8201349,5,B000RMJ4D0,"Wonderful, effective, very easy to follow. April Bernardi and her 35 week pregnant student demonstrate a series of fantastic yoga movements that relax and energise.  Great for easing discomfort, making room for your baby and preparing for delivery.  Like all yoga the breath is at the centre to the practice and Kundalini yoga always involves a fair amount of chanting that might not be everyones cup of tea.  The slightly bland production values may annoy some but personally I prefer a well planned workout to a stunning backdrop.  The exercise sequence is about 35 minutes long, just right for me as I have a busy toddler to look after.  Great for all stages of pregnancy.",1222646400,,675,4.834782608695652
8201350,2,B000RMJ4D0,I was really looking forward to this DVD and then it came in the mail.  The main yoga instructor is not pregnant so for me personally that made it a little less appealing and then the whole thing is shot on a ugly set in front of a brick wall.  Not very soothing scenery at all.  I have no comment on the exercises as I haven't even tried them yet.  I just didn't want to sit in front of a screen watching a such an ugly set for an hour.,1218326400,,437,3.8222222222222224
8201351,4,B000RMJ4D0,"Hi all, this video is pretty good and the asanas are excellent for us gals that are oh-so-swelling with life.  Easy on the sensitive areas, doesnt uncomfortably squish baby or bladder, and provides some much needed relaxation and stretching.  I have a feeling this is a valuable tool in my labor and delivery aresenal, as I feel the exercises really do open up the hips and help get the baby in proper birthing position.  Try it, especially if you don't mind a little chanting with your yoga!",1212278400,3,492,4.632183908045977
8201352,5,B000RMJ4D0,I got it because of the price and I would have paid twice this much If I knew it was so good.  I am leaving a review because I almost didn't buy it because it had no reviews.  Very good DVD.,1204243200,3,190,3.6097560975609757
