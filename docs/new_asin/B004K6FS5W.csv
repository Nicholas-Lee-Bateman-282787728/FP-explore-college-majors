4395585,5,B004K6FS5W,"2011 marks the 400th anniversary of the King James Bible.  The King James Bible has shaped the English language, inspired political and religious thought for generations and, arguably, changed the world.

The story behind the King James Bible has been told before.  And several new books this year will aim to tell it again.  1A Productions and Lions Gate studio have created a first class documentary featuring John Rhys-Davies which puts this story on screen.  And the result is almost as breathtaking as the powerful prose of the King James Bible itself.

""KJB: The Book That Changed the World"" takes us on a historical survey of the years preceding 1611 and the political and religious landscape which confronted the new King.  The story follows James I from his birth to his ultimate ascension to the English throne.  Particular focus is placed on the role the King James Bible would play in James' strategy to unify the landscape, politically and religiously.

Director and producer, Norman Stone does a fantastic job of capturing the life of Jacobean England with all of its intrigue.  The plot of Guy Fawkes is detailed in memorable fashion.  Filmed on location in England and Scotland, the film takes one inside Westminster Abbey and Oxford College to some of the actual rooms where the translators labored over their charge.  The photography and quality of the film is superb, countrysides and cathedrals alike are displayed in all their evocative power.

John Rhys-Davies exudes energy and vigor in his lively narration.  His booming, deep voice adds to the grandeur of the story.  At one point he climbs up into the pulpit of a centuries-old church to read from the pages of the King James Bible.

The documentary focuses almost exclusively on the historical setting and making of the King James Bible, only briefly explaining its lasting impact.  While acknowledging the place the Bible has for Christians, the film aims at a wider audience.  At times some historical license seems to be taken to make the story fit the producer's goals.  While Puritans and Anglicans worked together on the various translation committees, it should be noted the Puritans were at a decided minority.  More detail on translation techniques and practices could have been expected, too.  Still the film does not disappoint.  It brings to life the world of King James and the creation of his most lasting monument.

This documentary should be available on DVD in the United States this April, and Amazon is already taking pre-orders.  If you are in the UK, you can pick up a copy now.  Learn more about the film (and watch the trailer) at KJBtheFilm.com.

4395586,5,B004K6FS5W,Excellent history of the KJB. Used at church for Sunday morning by adult education group. A bit over an hour so coupled with discussion questions. Well received. Arrived promptly and properly packaged.,1502064000,,201,5.3125
4395587,5,B004K6FS5W,"There are so many good reviews of this superb work here, that it is difficult to add more meaningful opinion.  I first saw KJB some years ago, and I've always remembered it well for it's excellent production, information , and insights.  John Rhys-Davies is striking in his tutelage and presentation.  In fact, I've enjoyed this work so much, that I purchased this copy expressly to be able to share it excitedly with the handful of friends enlightened and curious enough to have a similar interest in history.  Perhaps, that may be the highest form of praise for any such work, but for myself it surely is so.  I highly recommend this work to any and all who have an interest and passion for the works of humanity's intellect, our history, and the language and prose with which we hope to communicate our most fondly held ideas.",1501372800,,829,4.6506849315068495

4395591,5,B004K6FS5W,Excellent docudrama! Fascinating presentation of the background of the effort and study that went in to the translation of the KJV Bible. Gives an overview of the forced cooperation between warring factions by King James.,1497571200,,221,5.3428571428571425

4395593,5,B004K6FS5W,"I wasn't sure what to expect, but this turned out to be a spectacular little film. Highly recommended for anyone who likes this sort of thing. It was half documentary, half historical drama. I feel like it was mis-titled (possibly to appeal to Christian enthusiasts of the King James Bible), because the focus was mostly on the life of King James and the religious battles of the time, and only to a small extent on the KJB itself. It was basically the story of the life of King James VI and I, well-told in about an hour and a half - which happened to be exactly what I was looking for. Host John Rhys-Davies is, of course, perfection. And the actor playing King James is delightful.",1495584000,,684,4.436507936507937
4395594,4,B004K6FS5W,"The ""movie"" itself may disappoint some who are looking for a big dramatic production.  But the collection of experts who discuss the players and the process are excellent.  The description of a brilliant scholar of the time who was NOT included as too abrasive was fascinating information.  As long as you're not expecting a Kenneth Branagh production, you'll enjoy this.",1491350400,,371,5.15
4395595,5,B004K6FS5W,I enjoyed this doc-drama. It was helpful to have the education piece along with the action play out of how the King James Bible came out. It is not boring!!,1486771200,,156,4.233333333333333

4395602,5,B004K6FS5W,"This DVD about the KJB is very good and explains about how it took from the word of God word by word. It was not changed to suit any particular church doctrine. It is the true vine of the WORD of GOD. When man change the words of God - and said it better this way or that way - it is from man said not GOD said... So this DVD with John Rhys-Davies explains very well the word by word translation from the Hebrew manual scripts to make the KJB.
The only thing that was inserted at first on the DVD is advertisement for a guys book - the guy is not a KJB user or believe the word of God KJB...  I'm satisfied with the DVD on KJB, but the advertisement they inserted on it is false doctrine from that guy...
KJB is the true vine... All other bible versions are mans interpretation...",1475452800,4,780,4.032258064516129

4395613,5,B004K6FS5W,"Great film about King James 1 and the writing of the bible that bears his name - few people know the story of all of the political bickering and bargaining that led to the creation of this version.  This film demonstrates all the ways in which it truly was a miracle that the translation was as well written and as scholarly as the KJB team produced, and how its writing was a direct product of the greatest political divisions of the day.",1461110400,,439,4.353658536585366

4395620,5,B004K6FS5W,It was very well done.  I agree with another reviewer that you need to watch the special features to go deeper into the actual people who worked on the translation process.  It is great that they included that information.,1456444800,,222,4.666666666666667

4395629,1,B004K6FS5W,"This program speaks well about the KJV bible but Magnifies the Man King James which history proves has VERY LITTLE to do with the publication of this bible, he was involved in name only! Plus King James was a Known practicing Homosexual that his son Charles did not approve of, this is the same Charles that Cromwell beheaded. King James was a fowl man with nasty habits and was not a protestant, he leaned heavily on the Catholic side probably for political reasons, as did his some King Charles which would explain WHY Charles was more friendly to Catholic nations if he was raised a solid protestant.

There is a VERY GOOD reason they defaced his effigy, and Catholic Leaning, Homosexual, worldly king would not be popular in protestant England.",1447891200,,748,4.753846153846154

No big monument for King James, unlike other kings and queens of England, and yet His name is on a bible that can be found in almost every household today.

I enjoyed all the background information, too.  I first watched a borrowed copy of the video and I ordered 2 immediately afterwards--one for me and one as a gift.  It is a must for anyone's library, but especially for Christians who want to have the very  best English translation of the Bible.  I highly recommend this video.",1424563200,,501,4.636363636363637
4395655,5,B004K6FS5W,"This very well-made documentary explores the history behind the 1611 King James translation of the Bible. I will admit to some reluctance going into this, fearing this would be some sort of cheesy KJV-only production, but it's actually a very engaging, well-produced and informative look at the history of this translation. John Rhys-Davies is the host (of Indiana Jones ""Asps, very deadly, you go first"" fame, as well as for playing the dwarf Gimli from 'Lord of the Rings') and he does a tremendous job full of energy in his narrative, bounding up stairs and clenching his fists emphatically as he talks about the historical setting in the early 17th century and the various discoveries and events at the time of this translation.
While Davies is the primary host of the narrative, there are also interviews with various church historians (including my homeboy Carl Trueman from Westminster Theological seminary, one of my favorite church historians) and there are also historical reenactments that, far from cheesy, are of a high-quality production and very well acted. We see the decline in health and eventual death of Elizabeth, and James I who subsequently takes the throne of England (James being the nephew of Elizabeth). We see historical reenactments of numerous events in his life leading up to his decision to have church leaders work together in committee to create a new translation of the Bible. Obviously the history presented isn't all inclusive, and there do seem to be a few lacking details (the Puritans were more than just two nervous-looking guys in black outfits, for instance) but we do get a window into the intriguing events of the translation and James' involvement in the process, as well as windows into fascinating events such as Guy Fawkes' gunpowder plot and the eventual outcome of this failed assassination attempt. The entire film is a very enjoyable and informative presentation. Especially cool in the film is when Davies actually takes to a pulpit and in his powerful baritone reads passage after passage from Scripture. The effect in incredible, both the quality of his booming voice but the power of the Word of God spoken.
Davies summarizes things well at the end when he notes that, while there isn't a monumental grave for James I, its noteworthy that his translation of the Bible , 400 some years later, can be found in almost every English-speaking home today, a tremendous legacy and a testament in God's goodness in preserving his Word.
A note about the content: the film is a 'Not Rated' rating, but this is for the most part safe for all ages to watch and would make a great family movie evening for discussion later - the only questionable content was an injured man earlier in the film with a bloody injury. Perhaps have little viewers turn aside at this point, but otherwise this was suitable for all ages.",1423958400,,2859,4.921325051759834

I think the KJB is great and one of the best  and is an excellent choice to learn Gods word, but there seems to be an attitude out there that the KJB is a 'super elite' special bible that is an exact/perfect translation.

I had no idea what story the movie would tell; I've appreciated the language of the King James Bible for almost all of my life and still use a version of it for my primary study Bible.

I had no idea of what had gone into the making of this translation and found myself fascinated by the well crafted story which provided the background and told of the intrigue surrounding the scholarship and effort involved in putting it all together. I remember my Greek professor in seminary commenting on the quality of the King James translation from the original languages.

While it is true that the English language is a living language and is in a constant state of revision as determined by popular usage, the King James translation, with minor updates to better translate the intended thoughts of the original writers, still communicates the message of the Bible with power, accuracy and dignity.

I heartily recommend this movie to all who love the Lord Jesus Christ and all who simply appreciate an exciting story very well told.",1409788800,3,1177,4.62200956937799

More to the purpose would have been a more extended consideration of previous translations,  particularly Tyndale. A consideration of how  KJB ""changed the world"", especially the English language, was a reasonable expectation, largely unfulfilled . The style of the translation, especially the NT, is said to be  more ornate than the source text. A hint that Biblical scholarship may have advanced somewhat in the past 400 years may be expecting too much.
 Small point: why was the presenter allowed to handle valuable 16th century documents without wearing gloves?
 A more extended consideration of the making of the AV is found in the 40 minute featurette. Almost gave a 3rd star for this. Unfortunately, the contention that the translators were working with the ""original"" text rather copies of copies made centuries after the fact and a few minutes of treacly piety at the end changed my mind, perhaps unfairly.

So I settled on this film since it fell historically between the time of John Calvin and that of John Wesley.  This is done very well.  It honors the King James Bible without being archaic in its perspective.  It shows the difference between the King James as a person and a perceptive linguist and that of the Anglican bishops and their Bishop's Bible and the Puritans and their Geneva Bible with its study notes.  As one practical application, I am even less likely to ever buy a study Bible.  Watch this film and be prepared to learn about translation in a fascinating manner.",1400457600,6,734,4.473684210526316

Contentious factions of the English church fought for the survival of their translation.  Heresy!  Too Catholic!  Too common!  (It's hard to remember that ""thee and thou"" speaking was the language of the common people.  Now we think of it as ""high church"" language.  Not so, in the days of Elizabeth and James.

John Rhys-Davies adds a wonderful touch of class to his hosting the drama that takes place.

We enjoyed both the explanations by John Rhys Davies in the real locations the events occurred in as well as the actors acting out the parts of the KJV Bible history. It really stirs your heart that God worked through people who did not even believe alike, but were Biblical scholars to be able to translate the Bible into the English version that helped change the world. The history is encouraging and I believe that once you understand the origins of the KJV it can excite you to keep passing on the Word of God in its original English form! God said He would preserve His Word through the ages, and this is one spectacular example in history where it has been passed down even in our language. So many of us owe our salvation to people that followed God and shared their faith using KJV verses. I believe it's even a great watch for the entire family!",1394323200,,888,4.420731707317073

4395721,5,B004K6FS5W,"'Astounding' is merely one description for experiencing this view into the initial English translation of the King James Bible, published in 1611.

One never knows what God will do with man's efforts to search His Word.  This marvelous DVD, in sterling presentation, pun unintended but nonetheless delightful, by John Rhys-Davies, reveals yet richer insights into the manifestation of His eternal blessings.

Reviews here substantiate the joys awaiting those who carve out time for yet another fresh perspective on the spawning of the most influential literary work of the modern era.  William Shakespeare, whose star was rising as the KJB was being translated, is estimated to have quoted from the KJB over five hundred times throughout his works.

The inclusion of dramatic narratives developing the life of King James demand a future feature film on the life of this extraordinary man.  Only eternity will confirm the exact influences directing this divine order, yet King James, with Archbishop James Ussher, stands an additional historical pillar who's life depths promise exciting revelations of God's leading in the minds of mortals.

Completing the thread of production, the DVD affords the filmmaker's commentary, and most importantly, an interview with Rhys-Davies and his personal testimony.  In the interest of continuing scholarship Mr. Rhys-Davies would enjoy contemplating I John 5:13.

A Special Features includes additional historical and theological aspects of the translating of the KJB by a handful of scholars.  Curiously, one perspective likens the flowing language of the KJB with the speeches of President Obama.  Curious, because the President's quoting of Isaiah 40:31 at a recent National Prayer Breakfast was rendered in such a distant, hollow fashion as to suggest the speaker was totally unfamiliar with the language and Author.

Initially hesitant to puchase this, it is one that I can watch several times and it'll still hold my interest. Surprisingly very well done and not cheesy as initially thought. Great bonus material. Wonderful scenes; visits to historical sites and educational value. I enjoyed his debates and intolerance with the Puritans, who ultimately requested one version of the Bible to unify worship which unexpectedly pleased the king - at least in this film.

This was one of those rare documentaries that actually had my kids enjoying a subject which could have been dull and uninteresting.

4395741,2,B004K6FS5W,"Highly inaccurate is an understatement. Something seemed odd from the start, and I found myself saying, ""that isn't right,"" often. Then, it was stated that James didn't show much interest in women, until...and then the love story starts with his wife. That was the last straw. James was highly managed, even as King of England. He didn't show interest in women, because he was gay. This is accepted historical fact. James refused to marry, so his advisors locked him up, until he agreed to do so. James married, but never gave up his homosexual lifestyle. This is why it is so funny when some Christians who say they love the King James Bible, but hate gay people. The work, however, should not be discounted because of the man. Whether James really commissioned it, or his handlers did it as a PR campaign, shouldn't matter. I am an ordained minister, and hobby historian. I know this subject well. Most people try to change historical facts, when something comes up that makes them uncomfortable, or they assume someone else might. This film is a prime example. Just because an actor reads a script, doesn't make it true. This fiction should have been presented as a straight movie, not as a partial documentary. The facts surrounding King James' life are so well know, it is safe to say this film is an intentional fabrication to change public perception. Other than this, it is well presented, hence the additional star.",1374969600,4,1424,4.7926829268292686

4395743,5,B004K6FS5W,"One only need to read the dedicatory preface to the original 1611 version of the KJV get a sense of the holy fear & trembling which possessed those 50+ men who undertook that seven year task to give us the most powerful and accurate translation of the original manuscripts in their day.

It begins with...

""TO THE MOST HIGH AND MIGHTY PRINCE JAMES,
BY THE GRACE OF GOD,
KING OF GREAT BRITAIN, FRANCE, AND IRELAND,
DEFENDER OF THE FAITH, &c.
The Translators of the Bible wish Grace, Mercy, and Peace,
through JESUS CHRIST our Lord.""

One must note that it is no small significance that the English crown's duty includes being the ""Defender of THE Faith"". And as his achievments proved, James took this duty most seriously. For him, there was no other ""faith"" which he was to defend but that of the Christian faith; and that, being the one described in particular detail in the New Testament.
What a saddening contrast it is that today's Crown Prince Charles so reflects England's apostasy that he refuses to be titled ""Defender of the Faith"", but rather wishes to change it to ""Defender of Faiths"". How pathetic an heir to such a godly legacy is he who would renounce that one faith which made England into ""Great Britain"" in order to appease a violent minority of insurgents whose religion has ever been the enemy of good men of conscience everywhere, and England in particular!

Back to James... No other monarch up to that point in English history had shown the pious wisdom James I had now demonstrated. In one surgical move he cut to the core issue which had been the cause of generations of strife both in England, and Europe at large; religious sectarianism.
All religions suffer sectarianism, and understandably so. But for that one religion which claims to have ""One Lord, one faith, and one baptism""; the truly pious Christians who knew God's Word abhorred the idea that Christian Brethren should go so far as to take up arms against one another; and the young King James exemplified that holy intolerance for such sectarianism.
The Apostle Paul abjured the early Church ""My brethren, I would that you all spake the same thing""...for their very unity depended on it. And so it was that with the deplorable trans. known as the ""Bishop's Bible"" being used by the Anglican Church of England, and the Puritans using a far more accurate trns. in the ""Geneva Bible"" yet so cluttered with polemical side-notes readers sometimes treated them as sacred text; the two sides seemed to be speaking entirely different languages!
It is to Jame's eternal credit that he found a way to reconcile these divisions by giving them one canon, in one common tongue as the only ""Authorized Version"" for use in English churches.

Today of course we have newer translations which are every bit as good and better than the venerable KJV since we now have even more recovered original transcripts upon which to based them, and too... they are written in today's modern English as opposed to the antiquated Shakespearean English.

This movie has done a great service in educating viewers as to the sociopolitical milieu surrounding this historic work, and hopefully will give them a better appreciation of the costs to make it available to them

4395744,5,B004K6FS5W,This movie really wove the historical and religious realities of the time together in an understandable and inciteful way.  It was amazing that King James was able to get the Puritan's Bible and the Bishop's Bible blended into the most accurate translation of that time - and for a long time.

Quality documentary filming and great actors to play the roles.  They could have made a King James movie and used the same folks.  The film does spend a great deal of time going over the upbringing and history of King James' life, but this is necessary to understanding why he was uniquely capable and positioned to bring the KJB about.  One comment was critical that it didn't go into an exposition as to how the KJB changed the world, being that it was in the title.  I do understand, but that wasn't the thrust of the film.  And to go into an explanation of the 400 years since it's publication and how and why it changed Europe, etc., is hard to do in an hour and thirty minutes.  At any rate, please watch if you have any interest in the Bible, the KJV, British history.  The quality rivals the excellent British TV documentaries done by David Starkey.

4395764,5,B004K6FS5W,"When I watch secular documentaries about Christianity or the Bible, I prepare for the usual anti-Christian bias and distortion. I'm a big fan of the Bible with a keen interest in English history. So I was pleasantly surprised by this film that skillfully and reverently weaves together the events of this pivotal era and helps bring it all to life. We don't usually hear much about James I. He's most often an historical footnote sandwiched between the more illustrious Elizabeth I and James' ill fated second son, Charles I, the only English monarch condemned to suffer open execution. But James himself is a fascinating study in deprivation and contradiction. Plain, club-footed and awkward, with a shambling gait and rough Scottish manners, this potty-mouthed monarch seems an unlikely candidate to crystallize the era of Gloriana and Shakespeare into the heavenly language of the Bible translation that bears his name. He grew up a lost little boy, an orphan really, cowed by a succession of devious and ambitious regents, bullied and battered by stern tutors. Not yet a year old when his father, Lord Darnley, was murdered, and just past his first birthday when permanently deprived of his mother, Mary Queen of Scots, forced into a convoluted odyssey of incarcerations culminating in her execution when James was 21. The film does a mostly good job of depicting much of this. A few things are overly romanticized. James' two coronations, for instance, were not huge affairs. His first coronation at 13 months as James VI of Scotland, and his second as James I of England some 40 years later were sparsely attended for various reasons - security concerns, outbreaks of the plague, etc. But for the most part this film is a fine depiction of the man and his role in producing the single most valuable, influential and best selling book of all time. For more on this fascinating era, I suggest an engaging study of James I and the KJB by David Teems, ""Majestie: the King Behind the King James Bible"".",1364774400,,2003,4.911504424778761

What stood out to me as miraculous was 1) how James was tutored from childhood and how it led to his ability to understand factional differences and the biblical
literature itself,  2) putting together opposing religous leaders of the day to produce the KB text, and 3) KIng James's decline soon after the bible was issued as well as the plot to end his rule.
The DVD will hold your attention even if you do not consider the bible understandable or are not a Christian beliver.  It is a noteworthy bit of extremely significant history that certainly has altered the lives of much of the world today.

We each grew up with this bible version and knew a little of how it came about, but we far more fully appreciate it and its inception now. This is an excellent show to watch on a Sunday night.

4395781,4,B004K6FS5W,"The film was honest & beautifully done ---if viewed merely in the temporal it would be a five star :-).

However, after being captured personally by the philosophies & traditions that we, as Christians ----the called out ones---are warned of in Colossians 2:8 ---and seduced to receive a false christ & gospel, and to be caught up in the futility of dialoguing with the devil and reacting to his phony philosophical evolutionary dialectic based only on the rudiments of this fallen world, man's vain imagination, and the doctrines of demons ----and which is utterly unable to stand forensic & objective evaluation ----first as a 'liberal' and then as a 'conservative' --- I am painfully aware of the insufficiency of any medium or message claiming to teach 'Christian' history or ethics, apart from a clear proclamation of the Gospel of Jesus Christ as revealed in God's Holy Word in 1 Corinthians 15.

I stand now on & in the Word:  finally a true convert: born again, regenerate & redeemed of God, & sealed with the Holy Spirit with that promise of eternal life & citizenship in the coming Kingdom of God.  The Word plainly teaches that Christ's Kingdom is not yet of this world, being invisible & only within the hearts of regenerate men ----and those who hate that humbling truth & seek to take men captive for their own agendas, bellies & gain work tirelessly ---& overtime---- to wrest & redefine the Word in the vain attempt to excuse themselves & their own sins, while striving to keep people endlessly learning in an illusion of 'progress', while never coming to the truth that alone can save their souls & free them spiritually from the kingdom of death.

Richard Dawkins is a perfect example of the ridiculous ends we men will go to avoid seeing the truth----when backed up against a wall due to the sheer irrationality at the faith presuppositional & fundamental level of their self-excusing ideologies ---'aliens' must have done it---- or perhaps, life was 'seeded' here on the 'backs of crystals' from outer space....  If that's not vain superstition embraced to avoid the true supernatural---I don't know what is!  While the pathetic & labyrinthine & crassly hypocritical & cross-avoiding philosophizing of supposedly 'Christian' 'creationists' such as Hugh Ross & the Biologos people vainly embracing & promoting (warmed over pantheism with 'Christian' frosting ---neo-scholastic compromise---vomit & wallows willingly returned to without any logical or reasonable necessity for doing so) -----------while allegorizing the Bible beyond recognition----is even more reprehensible!  Wandering stars & clouds that promise rain but never deliver, bringing to birth, but never delivering...  Fornicating & abortive 'Christianity'.  The Harlot is not the Bride, and by their fruit (wind & empty religious words void of reason & the Spirit of Truth) ye shall know them.

Christ, and not man, will establish His Kingdom in the visible only after the Usurper is received of those not keeping the Word & holding to the simplicity of Christ during the tribulation when the Jews, the Harlot & all the world will receive a false 'Messiah' (having heard & rejected the true).  This will not take place until after that Usurper tires of the Harlot's demands for a share of his glory & decimates those who will not deny the Lord & seal themselves to him by taking the mark to cleave to him exclusively, & turning against the Jews also with his demand to be worshipped in the place of God, then taking his even more ungodly solidarity & unity: coming with all the unrepentant nations against fleeing Israel to annihilate her.  It is at that time that Christ will return in glory with His saints to judge the nations & establish His Kingdom.

I now live as a pilgrim & ambassador in this world ----and realize the folly of focusing solely on this life, and any so-called 'Christian' endeavor that leaves out the Gospel of Jesus Christ in all of its glorious truth & distinction, that alone can overcome the Curse & death by the grace & mercy of God.  This happens by the bowing of one individual knowing & choosing soul at a time to the truth of the Gospel in faith & repentance ---never collectively or univerally.  The offer is universal, and the redemption is sufficient for all men------but the reception of it is not universal & not all men respond to conviction savingly.  This is further complicated by the fact that men who deny the Word & conviction ---are blind to the spiritual realm as it really is, & the fact that we have an active enemy seeking to destroy the souls of men by drawing them into his rebellion against God & Truth by his lesser, corrupt alternatives.  They are open & prone to listening to lying, deceiving, destructive spirits who come to them offering 'other ways' to God---even by denying Him and futilely claiming His divinity & authority for themselves as Satan did.

Christendom & social justice & evolution & dominionism ----all of those idols have blessedly fallen under forensic & objective examination alongside the plain narrative of God's Word so clearly revealed & preserved of God in the incredible King James Bible based on the preserved & living texts.  There are so many undeniable, objectively & forensically observable infallible proofs preserved within its pages that make sense of everything we observe & experience in this life, & true Christianity is the only faith that does not demand blind leaps in order to embrace it.  The Christian faith, as once delivered to the saints in the completed & closed canon of the Word of God, is not blind ---but sighted & substantiated in the visible created world.

This film was more honest & objective than most --- yet leaned into that materialist trap of interpreting things politically and psychologically (based upon philosophical materialism & pagan assumptions) which we all fall into without the Word & Spirit ---and even with them, if not grown to maturity through diligent study of the plain Word & persevering in the simplicity of Christ.  All men yet wrapped in corruptible flesh in this life are corruptible & fallible.  Sighted, knowing faith in Jesus Christ is the victory that overcomes the world as we resist sin, the flesh, the world and the devil armed with the Word & spiritual armor of God---and that faith comes through appeal to conscience & reason ----not by external imposition or compulsion through raw force, subversion or selective & hypocritical censorship in the name of 'tolerance' which is necessary only for the protection every truth claim that can not stand on its own merit in the light of comparison.

Rome & the State churches' reinsertion, & support,  of the Alexandrian texts to confuse the word & to insert doubt so as to turn the people back into bondage & dependency upon their false human authority & the bondage of their gnostic & nicolaitan systems was so cleverly done ---just like the Gunpowder Plot (covered honestly in this film for once, though without the full impact of understanding the spiritual undertows): stealthily & illegitimately ----in rebellion against the limitations of Truth.

I am grateful for this film which fills in some of the gaps of how God provided a powerful means for His people to be prepared, protected & enabled to persevere the coming onslaught of the Harlot's regathering strength after her apparently mortal wound was nursed & convalesced like some nightmare of an undying Athaliah---by the powerful preservation of His Word in a pure translation.

It is amazing in honest history to see God's true providence & superintendence at work as He sovereignly superintends in His foreknowledge, yet never violates the free will of man.  Defying man's systematic classification of Himself & His works according to any agenda or purpose of man!  True history reveals the universal depravity & short-comings of all mankind ---as well as our universal common heredity confirmed by genetics & making the terms 'race' & 'racism' obsolete & foolish as there is only one race: the human race, and two sexes as instituted & ordained by God & testified to in reality.  His Word is living & active: convicting of sin, showing the way of redemption in Christ, regenerating with spiritual life, giving us warning & pointing out human sin in & among all men by means of the measuring Law no man can keep, while any honest perusal of the creation reveals through simple observation & logic the existence of a transcendant Creator.

Were it not for the restraining & enlightening grace of God that brings life, coming to us through His Holy Spirit and Word--------even as it acts through imperfect men such as Noah, Abraham, David ---and James VI and I ---we would destroy ourselves in short order in our choice to embrace sin, destruction & the false light & lawlessness of the antichrist usurping spirit who seeks to kill and to destroy.

It was fascinating in this film (which stands up to a factual examination from source documents) to learn more of how the King James Bible came about in the visible & how God made it possible for His Word to be preserved, with James uniquely prepared & positioned to insure the evening out of the unbiblical extremes, and the vicious & cruel human & political agendas that sought to take captive the Word & keep it from the people as Rome's ungodly merger with the world had done for centuries.  As Cardinal Hosier put it in 1524: ""Were it not that the Baptist have been grievously tormented & cut off with the knife during the past twelve hundred years, they would swarm in greater number than all the Reformers.""

'Baptist' in this usage means those who held to the Word of God as their sole authority for practice & polity, living under the headship of Christ, within the bounds of the doctrine of Christ, in local autonomous churches where accountability was possible & as the Word commanded, in unity & fellowship with other churches so far as they held to that same doctrine & practice.  They submitted to earthly authorities willingly & were generally model citizens ---but bowed spiritually to no priest-king or god-man and were mercilessly cut off by Augustine of HIppo's Roman generals in North Africa, by Augustine of Canterbury's politically & diplomatically 'converted' Saxons at Bangor, & by Dominic Guzman's soldiers under Innocent III at Beziers.  Yet they clung to the Word, and when one church would wane through persecution, apathy and/or apostasy ----from the living seed of the Word, watered with the blood of martyrs: another church would spring up somewhere else, sheltering in some distant valley: another buzzing bee or upstart shepherd boy ---to challenge the false Giant 'Church' and world system.

So much for Christendom's claims of a great & glorious, unified  'heritage' and the philosophical Western Judeo-Christian political progressive wonder of spiritual progress that never was...  evolving to some claimed perfection by the strength of man's arm ---which the humble & simple recognize as hypocrisy merely by looking around with open eyes & common sense! Things have progressed exactly as prophesied in Daniel, & the other Prophets.  We don't date-set ---but we have the Word & the signs for our encouragement, the blessing promised in the opening verses of Revelation & in Matthew 24---- as we persevere & history approaches its culmination & resolution.  Meanwhile: our Anno Domini history, honestly reviewed, parallels the checkered history of the Jews (and perhaps surpassing it!), and it is clearly revealed that it is solely the grace of God that sustains & preserves, or suffers with patience, anything human.  The glory is His.

The world has never seen such a collection of scholars working together in the manner of the King James committee.  In His Providence God brought these amazingly gifted men together, renowned for their incredible scholarship even by the world, under the keen eye of King James who was savvy to the corruptibility & political aspirations of men grasping for power & illegitimate control over the souls of others (even if presumptuous on his own part regarding the so-called 'divine right of kings' :-).

This powerful, majestic, true- to- the- best -texts translation (not a paraphrase or an allegory) was done at a time when the Jesuits were just beginning to take the Counter-Reformation & the open conflicts of religion underground to act subversively in the realm of the spiritual (of ideas ---with the goal of infiltrating & turning every human institution back to the corrupted & nicolaitan, gnostic & humanist Roman Babylonian 'authority' & 'unity').  It was accomplished during a brief window of opportunity before the Oxford Movement & neo-scholasticism had fostered sufficient corruption to spawn the lying Trojan Horse of 'higher criticism'  & pseudo-scholarship ----the bastion of unbelieving hubristic men with no faith in, or fear of, God who began lying unholy hands on the Word of God & every center of power once again ----worshipping power & their own vanity before God -----and hating the powerful light of the King James that enlightened the souls & understanding of the people, and revealed the hypocrisy of every pretender to sinless perfection or 'divine right' of authority.

It was accomplished before God permitted the ancient pagan evolutionary lie of Epicurus & Democritus ---and the Eastern anti-truth, antichrist philosophies-----to come back in, the way prepared through eighteenth & nineteenth century intrigue, corruption & false spiritualism that raised up generations who refused to be bound by, or tested by, objective truth & the Word of God as it was so powerfully & majestically preserved in the King James Bible against such incredible odds!  All of it unfolding just as prophesied in Romans 1 & Psalm 12 & Psalm 2 in so many other passages!

It is tragic when men harden themselves so against the testimony of truth without them in the Creation, as well as within them, in their God-given conscience that is the remnant of the image of God providentially preserved of Christ in fallen mankind (John 1, Romans 2)-----having suppressed the truth in unrighteousness to excuse their ungodly desires for so long that God in His wisdom & foreknowledge turns them over to their lusts: fools professing wisdom, the blind seeking to lead the blind, the deceived & deceiving.

All in all, I recommend this film but would also recommend that men examine the work of Dean Burgon and the Baptist collections of out-of-print testimonies & histories written before the great falling away, dumbing down, and ecumenical harlot had made such headway & taken so many institutions & denominations from within that Roman-style censorship & fascistic/communistic/gnostic human 'authority' & draconian systems are once again fashionable & considered without the cries of alarm they once would have brought from a biblically literate & regenerate people, united in the sighted & substantiated doctrine of Christ and the Spirit of Truth and life, rather than merely united blindly in lust & the doctrines of demons serving the spirit of anti-truth and death.  We don't even recognize the selective censorship of political correctness for what it really is!  Let alone the soft, schmoozy, seductive & smooth talk of 'social justice' & fascist communitarianism that begins all warm and mystical and fuzzy----sounding vaguely 'Christian' & 'feeling' oh-so-good  ----but which tempts men into using evil means to achieve supposedly godly ends----and leads the unwary into a deadly embrace of tyranny: the way that seemeth right to a man, but the end of which is death.

Fundamentalist Baptist Information Service has an impressive digital collection of out of print books & commentaries, diaries & so forth at a reasonable price that cover this period of history & the amazing scholarship & godliness of this historically unique group of men that God brought together against all odds to accomplish the preserving of His Word; while other sources would include the Dean Burgon and Trinitarian Bible Societies.  (There are obvious & logical reasons why the coming world Harlot religion & Antichrist would desire & need to suppress & deny the utterly unique mark of the trinitarian godhead, as well as to obfuscate the prophecies, & the thousands of forensically & observably supported & testable infallible proofs that support & reveal the Word of God ---Old and New Testaments---to be exactly what it claims, and which clearly & unmistakeably identify Jesus Christ of Nazareth, the only resurrected Lord, as the true Christ and Messiah and Salvation of the world ----by mythologizing & allegorizing it with reinterpretive license rather than honest translation.)

Don't you think you should investigate this most important claim honestly & directly for yourself rather than trusting the 'experts' who profit (temporarily at least) from your ignorance?  I'm sure thankful that I did.  1Cr 15:55  O death, where [is] thy sting? O grave, where [is] thy victory?  -----This film could be a piece of that examination---but there is so much more for those who seek truth honestly & diligently!",1357776000,2,17160,5.04418522446094

4395798,4,B004K6FS5W,"This exceeded my expectations in how well it was done. It's quite an exciting movie for something that many consider to be just a ""book"". I believe the Bible is far more than a book. For those concerned this does not promote the KJB as the ""only"" acceptable Bible, but it does cast the KJB in highly favorable light.

I think the rest of my review is somewhat subjective to my beliefs, and point of view, so pardon me if it seems directed toward Christians a little, but these are my feelings. This also may be a little bit of a spoiler so just so you know. I don't know if a documentary can really be spoiled, but it does have a plot to it.

Because of the entertainment factor in making a movie like this, it doesn't go very deep into the techincal stuff that Bible scholars are interested in. Not that I was exepecting that, but that was my sort of thing, so don't expect that.
I kind of cringed a little at how much emphasis was put on man's accomplishment when really the accomplishment was God's. But I would have to agree that this event was important in the history not only of Christianity, but in the English language, and perhaps as the plot shows, the promotion of a common cause that people with different beliefs contributed to. I don't think it's promoting ecumenism, it's just that's how King James orchestrated it, that they would all cooperate.
The way King James went about it I found slightly offensive to my faith, but not enough for me to bash the whole movie. It's a good topic, and although I might have made it a little less dramatic, it did have some drama in it that makes it an exciting movie. There are many twists and turns, and interplays between the various characters that are complex, and present some thought provoking moral, and doctrinal dilemnas. I could take sides on many of the religious characters and King James himself at different points, one exception being the Anglican Bishops. This is all narrated by the way, but the narration does not get in the way of the unfolding drama, so my memory of it is like watching it unfold like a movie.

Permit me to enthusiatically add that I hope this movie encourages those who are not familiar with the KJB to read the KJB or any decent Bible for that matter, but you might find the KJB more compelling to read in light of this movie, and appreciate the language used, and see it's historical context rather than some boring prose.",1352419200,,2417,4.463800904977376

Although the KJV was not ""inspired"" as the original texts were, we can certainly see God's providence in preserving a unifying English text with worldwide effects.  What a story!

Ironically, the publishers of the new ESV Bible have used the extraordinary KJB as a launching point for marketing their own version of the Bible.  Although there are certainly language similarities, the KJV and the ESV are actually based on very different texts.

There was some violence portrayed when James was a boy if you are very sensitive to blood or violence (preview it before showing it to the kids just in case).  Besides that the film was top notch.

4395811,5,B004K6FS5W,"I was surprised at just how good this was.  I am not a fan of docudramas.  I have found that most of them take huge liberties with history in order to fulfill some kind of theatrical effect that those involved seem to think necessary.  But this one escapes from that kind of limitation.  I was impressed with the acting, the history, the settings and costumes.  It all works together effectively.

The dvd is a narrative history of how the KJB was created.  The narration is done superbly by John Rhys-Davies who walks us through the actual locations where the events took place.  The central character is King James I and VI.  The dvd gives us a lot of information about the background of James in Scotland and how that background shaped his character.  This background helps us to understand the way James approached the competing High Church and Puritan factions when he assumed the throne of England, thereby uniting England and Scotland under a single monarch.

I was intrigued with how the producers gave James a more hands-on role in the translation than some histories of the KJB I have read.  There has, at times, been a tendency to diminish the role James played in the sense that some put forth the idea that though James initiated the project, after that he had little to do with it.  This dvd depicts, in contrast, a James who is deeply involved in the project.  Given the background of James, and his own considerable scholarly attainments, I suspect that the dvd is a closer reading of the relationship James had with the project.

Be sure to view the special features section.  This contains more extensive remarks by historians and by the narrator John Rhys-Davies.  I found these remarks at times deeply moving.  I rarely view special features for movies, and if you are similarly inclined I urge you to make an exception in this case.  The material offered in these interviews is fascinating and heartfelt.

That doesn't mean that I don't get out or watch movies much, it does mean that this production has many elements that make it far better than the uninspired rhetoric we are getting from Hollywood these days.  It also has content that draws you into the story and makes answering the phone or door much too much of a bother.  But, I dare say it is even more than that.

What does it have to make it so good?  An exceptionally well acted recreation of the story behind the making of the biggest selling book of all time, the King James Version of the Bible.  Narrated by John Rhys Davies, a man who puts himself into the story rather than being a distant voice droning on behind the scenes, shows a passion for the story himself and it is clearly evident.  The acting is superb and those portraying known characters represent them with astounding accuracy.

What it doesn't have is any proselytizing or overt religious biases.  Considering where such a production might go, this one is in it for the story, not an alter call.  The added features, though few, are worth commenting on.  The interviews behind the making of the movie are moderately interesting and conducted well.  However, the separate interview with Mr. Davies is definitely worth watching and adds a bit of a twist to the whole thing. When they asked him at least one question, you wondered if the DVD had stuck as he took a little longer than one would expect him to answer, but he did and perhaps not the way you were thinking he would.

So, to say it simply, this one deserves more than 5 stars as it has made it into the class of movies which have achieved the well deserved moniker of ""outstanding"".  `5 stars' is for those movies that you feel satisfied with when you finish them that you saw everything you came to see and got your monies worth.  `Beyond 5 stars' is reserved for those you would watch repeatedly and still find them worth your time every time you see it.

4395824,4,B004K6FS5W,KJB - The Book that Changed the World is an entertaining documentary/Docudrama that mostly focuses on the life and reign of James VI (Scotland) / I (England/UK) that shows off his sheer ability as a mediator and monarch with his great project: an universal bible acceptable by all the religious factions in his realm. The main flaw of this documentary is that the presumed subject - the creation of the King James Bible - takes a backseat to looking at the life and motivations of King James I.,1303344000,3,494,4.625
4395825,4,B004K6FS5W,"""KJB: The Amazing Tale of the birth of the King James Bible"" can best be described as a ""celebration"" of the Authorized Version, released to mark the occasion of its 400th anniversary this year. A docu-drama narrated and hosted by John Rhys-Davies (Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Lord of the Rings trilogy), the film takes the viewer through the tumultuous times which led up to the publication of the KJB in 1611. Produced by IA Productions and Lionsgate as a direct-to-DVD release, it is a film clearly targeted to a Protestant Christian audience and, to a lesser degree, British history enthusiasts. While for many this may appear as condemnation, given the often poor quality of many ""Christian"" films and documentaries, KJB comes off quite well when compared with many mainstream historical docu-drams and may be of interest to a general audience as well.
Overall production values were quite good, even lavish, with excellent cinematography, music and editing. There was none of the repetitive use of ""money shots"" so beloved of directors of low-budget doc TV. What was perhaps most distinct about this production were the longer than normal dramatic sequences. At times, these ""mini-dramas"" were so extensive and engrossing as to almost threaten to derail the documentary through-line.
On their own, these dramas were quite good, and when compared with other recent depictions of the Tudor and Stuart eras, were refreshingly unglamorous. Paola Dionisotti as Elizabeth I, with her eccentric mannerisms and hilariously askew fright wig, presents a far less varnished (and perhaps more accurate) version of the Virgin Queen than the recent iconic portrayals by Cate Blanchet and Dame Helen Mirren. The bulk of the dramatic narrative, however, is given over to Andrew Rothney as James VI and I. One could almost say that this is as much a biography of James as his book. Rothney's James is one of emotional frailty and sudden flashes of strength and even vitriol. The two best scenes in the film involve a debate with his tutor George Buchanan (played with Puritanical intensity by James Bryce) at a young age, and the negotiation with establishment churchmen and puritans which leads to the commissioning of the AV. Both scenes are emotionally charged, but also give a good sense of James's legendary scholarship. As a family film, KJB skirts around the more sordid and controversial aspects of James's character, but such details would not have been relevant to the main story of the translation in any case, and would only have been sensationalistic if included.
Perhaps the best acting in the film, however, comes from Rhys-Davies himself. As host, his enthusiasm for history and the KJB are palpable. As he ambles through churches and palaces, his energy and gusto make other historical documentary hosts seem pale, even cold-blooded by comparison. His great moment comes at the end, when he ascends into the pulpit and intones some of the ""highlights"" of the KJB's remarkable prose. Listening to these so-familiar passages in Rhys-Davies baritone, it was not hard to see how even atheist Christopher Hitchens can have a sense of awe and reverence at the power of the KJB's language, as he recently expressed in Vanity Fair.
Despite all the remarkable qualities of this doc, there is one great weakness to ""KJB"" and that is there is so little about the KJB itself. With so much attention given to the royal succession, the commission and even the gun powder plot, the actual translation process becomes a secondary consideration. Yes, translation work is not exactly ""hot stuff"" dramatically, at least it is not as visually dramatic as the gunpowder plot, which only has a tangential connection to the story of the KJB, and I realize that the filmmakers were attempting to garner as wide an audience as possible, but I find this lack of imagination disappointing. To be fair, my complaint about this is not directed exclusively at the makers of this film, but comes from an overall and long-term dissatisfaction with so much of ""educational"" programming. Is it an inherent limitation of the medium? I'm not certain, but it would be encouraging to see more filmmakers take a risk and make the effort to create truly intellectually engaging and inspiring documentaries.
That said, the filmmakers attempt to make up for the film's weaknesses in the bonus features of the DVD. For my money, this is where the gold is. Along with some trailers, there is a 40 minute long featurette called ""Words from the Wise"". This is in fact the real documentary about the KJB. Comprised entirely of interviews with historians who are given only minor sound-bites in the main doc, a much more comprehensive and interesting picture of the KJB finally emerges. Much of the discussion revolves around the colourful lives of the translators and the often heated committee meetings. While listening to these historians, which included the likes of Carl Trueman, Helen Moore, W.B. Patterson, William Naphy, David Burke, Peter McCullough, Pauline Croft and Ashley Null, I kept thinking to myself `why wasn't this dramatized?' and `why didn't they mention that character in the main doc?'
Along with this featurette there was also a twelve minute interview with John Rhys-Davies. I did not watch this immediately, suspecting it to be one of those puff pieces where an actor is allowed to wax uneloquent on material for which he or she is not exactly an expert. To my amazement, when I did finally watch it, I found it to be the best and most moving twelve minutes of the whole DVD. Rhys-Davies may not be a professional scholar, but as a word-smith, he was able to articulate a view of the significance of the KJB almost as worthy as the prose of the KJB itself. Two of my favourite quotes:

 ""It's a special Bible, written at a special time, a time when the language was actually molten, when language could have gone any way... they shaped it thus.""

  ""The Protestant Reformation is about a need for words, is a need for great sermons, is a need for instruction, is a need for moral debate as much as it is entertainment. They don't want these puny thirteen minute homilies, they want four hours of scholarship [and] difficult reasoning. They want the assurance that there is a way from this mire of earth to the certainty of heaven. How do we navigate, how do we negotiate a way there? Tell us, o curer of our souls! And they get it.""

The interview ends with Rhys-Davies discussing his own relationship to faith. I won't say whether he is or is not a Christian, but will leave that for the viewer to discover. As a Christian myself, I found his testimony to be the most unbelievably moving few minutes I have seen on video in a long while. If there are Christian filmmakers out there reading this, moments like these are the kind of thing you need to be capturing on film.",1302912000,134,6856,4.890799656061909

8432463,5,B004K6FS5W,"The only negative reviews I'm even seeing of this film are from people who obviously received a defective copy (which should most certainly either be replaced on the seller's dime or for which they should be promptly refunded) and people who have some kind of extraneous or peculiar bias against certain historical figures the subject matter deals with.

Namely,  King James.

I can't imagine how anyone who watches this film who loves truth could walk away from it bereft of a heightened appreciation for the word of God and his sovereignty in history, and regardless of one's opinion of King James, how thoroughly the scriptures are vindicated in his legacy when they say ""The King's heart is in the hands of the Lord.
