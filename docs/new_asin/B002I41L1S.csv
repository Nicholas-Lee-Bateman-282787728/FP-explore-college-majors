8370648,5,B002I41L1S,"Note that the intent of this title is to act as a 'springboard' to give you ideas, not to teach songs, so for a learning acoustic guitar player, this is an excellent learning package -

First and most importantly, the teacher, Rich Maloof is engaging and enthused throughout - he explains in depth the reasoning behind each lick and how it can be used. This alone is well worth the money.

The video and sound quality are good, and you can see what each hand is doing. Each lick has a title and is on its own track, and the menu allows you to search between banks of licks, which makes navigating easier than similar videos.

On top of the video, you get a download code for the supplemental materials which include guitar TAB, standard notation, practice rhythm tracks AND they even include Power Tab files, which can be imported into Guitar Pro.",1459468800,,847,4.522875816993464
8370649,5,B002I41L1S,Its exactly as advertised. I didn't dig everything but was worth the money for sure. Five more words are required.,1373932800,,114,4.75
8370650,4,B002I41L1S,"I enjoy learning the new Licks, would like to see more about incorporating them into songs, but I think that is what private lessons are for. Would recommend if a moderate player. A little to simple for accomplished guitarists, and I would think a little to difficult for a beginner. I am not a master of the guitar, but have played for several years, and am accustomed to different finger picking and strumming styles.",1372464000,,419,4.675675675675675
8370651,5,B002I41L1S,"I give this video 5 stars.  Rick Maloof's approach is straightforward and easy to follow.  I am a progressing beginner and some of the licks are quite a challenge.  The video quality and having each example broken down at slower tempos is a great help.  I think anyone regardless of skill level can get something out of this.  I have learned 5 out of 50 licks and playing and learning is a lot more fun.

I don't really have any negative to say about this product.  Its value is determined by determined practice.  I would recommend this to all players.",1355270400,2,553,4.46
8370652,5,B002I41L1S,"Rich Maloof is an excellent instructor and he gives lots of information for us acousitc players. These are the licks Paul Simon, Neil Young, Jose Feliciano and many acoustic greats use. don't miss this great course!!",1283126400,3,216,5.027777777777778
