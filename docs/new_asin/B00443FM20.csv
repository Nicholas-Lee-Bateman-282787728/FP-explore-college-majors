in things Irish. I read 2 books on Grace and I found this narrated
DVD of Grace much better",1390521600,2,157,3.787878787878788

8415719,3,B00443FM20,"This program is amazing. Very little is known about Grania O'Malley because men of the time thought she didn't fit the role of a ""Celtic Maiden"" and wrote her out of history. The problem I had was that when I got the DVD, it was a bootlegged copy. You could see ""DVD-R"" on the disc, it was purple, and the packaging wasn't professional. For $36.00 I was ripped off with a copy. Amazon should be more careful about what they sell.",1317081600,5,429,4.308641975308642
