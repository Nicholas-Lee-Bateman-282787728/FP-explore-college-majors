5682759,5,B00BYGTN5M,"""The Telephone Book"" is about a girl who falls in love with the world's greatest obscene phone caller. Because of horrors in distribution this movie from 1971 has never received it's due as a great comedy. The movie features Barry Morse (Space:1999), Roger C. Carmel (Harry Mudd on Star Trek) and William Hickey (Prizzi's Honor) in supporting roles. But the major star is announcer Norman Rose as the obscene phone caller. At the time of the shooting, Rose was the voice of Ma Bell. Sara Kennedy is perfect as Alice, the girl hunting around Manhattan for the voice of her erotic dreams. Nelson Lyon was the father of Judd Apatow and Todd Phillips.",1368057600,6,647,4.734513274336283
8575603,5,B00BYGTN5M,"This should have been a smutty, smarmy sex comedy, but due to the immensely likeable Sarah Kennedy (""Rowan and Martin's 'Laugh In"" and ""Match Game""), ""The Telephone Book"" is almost cute.  Well, quirky, cute and smutty might be a better description.  Ms. Kennedy is a lonely, sensitive young woman living in New York, who is the recipient of an obscene phone call.  However, this is not just any obscene phone call, but the ""Citizen Kane"" of obscene phone calls.  Kennedy makes it her mission to track down this caller, taking her down a winding trail of early 70s perversion.  Nelson Lyon points his wonderful cast, (Roger C. Carmel, Barry Morse, Dolph Sweet, AND Jill Clayburgh who wears a sleep mask and has a very big gun), in the right direction, while providing the look of 70s New York grindhouse fare.  Yes, this movie earns its ""X"" rating (particularly due to the animated scene near the end of the movie), but with the exception of the animation, ""The Telephone Book"" is far from pornographic, but a charming-in-a-strange-way sexy movie, that defies classification.",1480291200,,1074,4.906077348066298
8575604,3,B00BYGTN5M,"Not bad, I actually did not like the animations at the end, thought they were over the top and crude. I understand they were an afterthought when they had problems with the filming of the original intended ending, and it shows.",1461283200,,227,4.560975609756097

8575607,4,B00BYGTN5M,"Looking for soemthing ""different"" and retro the other night, the girlfriend and I decided to watch The Telephone Book (on Netflix). I had no plans on watching the whole movie but was curious to see how it was shot and was just hoping to see some cute girls and silly retro hijinks. What I got was a surreal arthouse film that not only had me laughing but also featured one of the most magnetic and adorable female leads in any movie since Meg Ryan first hit the scene (and unlike Meg Ryan, Sarah Kennedy loves to be nude). The story is absurd, funny, sexy and definately worth owning. The movie will be too ""weird"" for mainstream audiences but it's one to show your friends during a party or just to run in the background with the volume off while music plays. Sarah Kennedy is an absolute doll and her misadventures through the New York sex/fetish scene will keep you in stitches!",1394323200,,881,4.478260869565218

8575609,4,B00BYGTN5M,"this sex romp is so very early 60's!  It's got a Laugh-in star and a naked guy draped across a desk with a flower in his...
it pokes fun at the sexual revolution in a candid, silly, off-beat way that one seldom sees in films from more recent, jaded decades.  It has a lot of nudity but I wouldn't call it pornographic -- just kooky",1383264000,2,331,4.076923076923077
8575610,5,B00BYGTN5M,"Odd non-sequiturs and wild witty digressions delivered with soothing calm..excellent compositions, hilarious animation and a nice soft core thrill-- this is lots of fun!!

I had the good fortune to be able to produce 2 full length CDs with Nelson Lyon and Hal Willner. It's a drag that such a brilliant artist doesn't have a filmography and discography a mile long. However, I would urge anyone who enjoys this film to also check out Nelson's work with Paris Records:  Dead City Radio by W.S. Burroughs and Give Me Your Hump! The Unspeakable Terry Southern Record. Like The Telephone Book, these projects are loaded with cameos from Nelson's friends--all of whom are well known stars. He took great care with his productions- in fact, his perfectionism almost drove us nuts! All the same, Nelson's production values were well worth it, and I will value his friendship for the rest of my life.

Nelson Lyon 1939-2012.. We miss you, Nels, and I know you would never want to ""rest in peace"".",1378771200,2,988,4.834319526627219
8575611,5,B00BYGTN5M,"I saw this come up in the list of trailers on the Cinefamily Vimeo and was intrigued enough to look for more clips and found ""The Telephone Book (1971) Obscene Phone Caller Confession"" which was weird, but the one the clip that made me purchase the DVD immediately was ""Lucy Lee Flippin in The Telephone Book"" and not only me, one of my friends wanted to buy it also.

The movie structure is a lot like a French art movie mixed up with Wharhol with a young lady falling in love with the world's best obscene caller and having adventures trying to track him down.

I thought the scene with the train flasher running away from the protagonist as he was scared of dirty women was funny.

There are sex scenes in the movie, but they are shot artistically so you can call this art more than sleaze. The scene in the pornographer's den has a woman who does the fastest boobie shaking I have seen.

It's hard to really explain the progression of this movie in any logical sense, the colour sequence at the end and the animation will either be the icing on the cake or make you turn off the movie.

Not sure who to recommend this movie to, hopefully fans of rare weird releases will enjoy it as I have heard other reviewers saying they had never heard of it and they have been out looking for titles like this for years.",1377648000,2,1312,4.317073170731708
8575612,3,B00BYGTN5M,"Vinegar Syndrome truly surprised me this time. They're getting well known for releasing Blu-ray / DVD combo packs that are filled to the brim with bonus material for hard to find films. They're becoming the standard for releasing these films in widescreen looking better than any of them should have a right to, but they surprised me by releasing a film that could be considered to have underground cult status, and had me laughing all the way through. ""The Telephone Book"" is their best release yet, and a film you need to own.

The comedy stars Sarah Kennedy as Alice who looks and sounds like a blonde Betty Boop. Alice has fallen in love with the world's best obscene phone caller ""John Smith"" (played brilliantly by Norman Rose). John has dared Alice to try and find him by giving her two clues; his name and that his number is in the Manhattan telephone book. You should see how many John Smiths there are in the Manhattan telephone book! Not to be dissuaded, Alice agrees.

As she starts her search, she heads to a studio where she was told to go by one of the Smiths in the phone book. She finds herself in the middle of an audition with ""Har-Poon"", an out of work stag movie actor whose real name just happens to be John Smith as well. He is having an orgy audition so that he can star and direct his own comeback. As Alice gets ready to settle in to the audition, the real John Smith calls and tells her that she is not at the right place. This is where rational thinking would tell you to wonder how he knew she was there. Well, rational thought doesn't really have a place in this movie, so just go with the flow and enjoy the laughs. And speaking of laughs, there is so much sexual innuendo going on throughout the film that you really have to pay attention, or you'll miss some of the jokes.

Now, some of the funniest parts of the movie come between Alice's adventures. They are pseudo documentary style confessions of three or four men who used to be obscene phone callers. They have since changed their ways, and are now leading normal lives. The problem is that in every case, their normal lives are more screwed up than they ever were when they were simply making obscene phone calls. You'd think this would play out as padding for the running time, but that isn't the case at all, and I found myself wishing they had found a way to fit one or two more guys in there to share their ""normal"" lives.

When Alice is taking the subway home, she meets a pervert who decides he will give her pay phone money to try and find John in exchange for her telling him her most exciting sexual escapade. Hilarity ensues as she tells him a story involving a minister, soap and water, and a week long erection. Needless to say, she gets more money than even she was hoping to get. After being robbed, and then seduced by a lesbian, John's call comes to the rescue telling her to go home. Does she meet her John Smith? How do they relate? What will they discuss? Will there be amazing sex? I will give you one hint. The last ten minutes of this movie are absolutely amazing! This is a very under-appreciated art house film that deserves a much wider audience.

Of course Vinegar Syndrome has spared no expense in putting out the highest quality package possible. Widescreen black and white presentation. Only a couple of drop outs in the first few minutes of the movie take away from the overall excellent sound. For the extras, we have an audio commentary with producer Merv Bloch, a reissue trailer, the original trailer, a still gallery and radio spots. There is no reason to wait. Buy this now, and enjoy the laughs.",1368921600,8,3622,4.440601503759399
