5689482,2,B00C2VYK7Y,"I really wanted to write a ridiculously fantastic comment for this video but I can't! My son watches I love toy trains pt1-6 every day almost and for the sake of my son not watching the SAME video over again I bought this with high hopes. My son was not interested in it within he first 10 minutes and I've tries several times to play it again and he is not interested.

I think the biggest deterrent is this CREEPY doll they have that talks to the kids in an even MORE CREEPY voice than he looks. It's just creepy! I don't know if that's what my son dislikes about it. We have not got back maybe 15 or 20 minutes. The doll is just creepy. I don't like it. My son doesn't like it.",1396569600,2,680,4.037037037037037

5689493,1,B00C2VYK7Y,"Vinny the Puppet is the biggest disappointment about this video. It is a very creepy marionette that has an equally creepy and disturbing voice.  We ""rented"" this video through Prime and never watched it again after. The series is usually fine, but this is a big miss. Sometimes the audio doesn't match to the movement. Trust me, that adds to the creepiness.",1401062400,,358,4.774193548387097
8576858,5,B00C2VYK7Y,My children enjoy the I love Toy Train Series. Definitely worth it,1521763200,,66,4.583333333333333
8576859,5,B00C2VYK7Y,"Good movie. People who are complaining a that this is ""stereotyping"" and that the doll is ""creepy"" are whiners. End of story",1488067200,,124,4.681818181818182
8576860,5,B00C2VYK7Y,These Toy Train videos are absolutely the best. I have a major train lover (2 1/2 year old) who watches these on almost a daily basis. The narration is adorable and the kids learn a ton from the narrators.,1485043200,,205,4.282051282051282

8576864,1,B00C2VYK7Y,This video was not entertaining and we only made it through a few minutes of it before turning it. Wasted time.,1465257600,,111,4.333333333333333
8576865,5,B00C2VYK7Y,It was fun. AAA+++,1456790400,,18,3.75
8576866,1,B00C2VYK7Y,"Not a fan of this. There is a section about getting girls into trains and the narrator makes the comment that the little girl adds a ""girl touch"" to the train by putting dolls in the cargo carriers. This is not the only instance of gender stereotyping. In addition, there is a freaky puppet guy who does a history of the US. He is in front of the capitol and makes a statement about how this is where Congress does a lot of talking but gets nothing done. Even if you think this is true, why is this in a video for little kids?",1452556800,,526,4.0673076923076925
8576867,5,B00C2VYK7Y,Excellent entertainment for all ages,1444262400,,36,6.4
