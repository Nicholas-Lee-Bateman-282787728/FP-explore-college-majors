8755029,5,B01D5MQQ2A,"As ludicrous and inane as the premise of Gonna Be the Twin-Tail!! is, this is probably one of my favorite anime I've seen to date. Outstandingly hilarious, fantastic action scenes and a great combination of voice acting and music make for one heckuva good watch. I was hooked from the first episode! The skill with which it parodies other anime is legendary, to say the least. A must watch!",1527552000,,390,4.666666666666667

8755031,5,B01D5MQQ2A,"a nice blend of different anime culture in this harem anime.  (an anime where one usually have several women in love with a single guy.)  the series is a little Ranma 1/2,  a bit Sailor moon (sensei)  come up first in my mind what with all the flat chest jokes of one of girls in love with the main character who is a man that changes into a girl when battling alien invaders.  the team of girls with weapons that seem to pull out of no where is very sailor moon and Power rangers.  the enemy also makes me think a bit Power Rangers as we got a bunch of generals with names and a lot of nameless and faceless pawn aliens that get taken out as well much like the early Power ranger series.  In a more adult sort of way even think a bit of Changelings from My Little Pony as the aliens feed on love.  Just not the G rated type Hasbro uses.

basically this show has a nice blend of comedy and action without taken things too over the top like some anime that makes humor at what is found in other animes. a short and entertaining series for fans of any of the anime shows I mention above.",1477612800,,1085,4.056338028169014

8755038,5,B01D5MQQ2A,"An affectionate parody of the super sentai and tokusatsu genre, Gonna be The Twin-Tail! is a phenomenally hilarious series with great action and a stellar voice cast that, honestly, makes me sad it only lasted for one season. Initially, I bought this as an impulse buy, mostly because it looked like one of those ""so bad it's good"" shows, and I have never been more happy to have been proven wrong/right in that regard. I say that because this is one of those kinds of shows that acknowledges the fact that it's premise is incredibly silly and rolls with it, and it shows in the dub as well. While it's a shame that there are only twelve episodes in this series that could honestly have continued for a second season, that's still no reason to pass up this comedic, light-hearted, action-packed, self-aware parody that pays homage to the likes of Power Rangers, Kamen Rider, and Akibaranger. I'd definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a ridiculous comedy that pokes fun at the sentai genre but still manages to have a great story and cast, or who just wants to watch something that's plain fun and enjoyable overall.

5 out of 5.",1465516800,12,1138,4.661691542288557
