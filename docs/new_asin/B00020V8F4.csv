8019850,3,B00020V8F4,"I purchased this DVD for nostalgic reasons, have an old VHS copy from 1989, and the DVD picture quality was so poor after adjusting the TV for over 10 min picture quality was only marginally better than the old VHS copy. Buy this from another manufacture than Digital Video Dreams. The story itself is an interesting look at distopian future civilazation thru low budget 80's retro glasses.",1435536000,,390,4.835820895522388
8019851,1,B00020V8F4,"Dumb plot, very poor production values, plot is inconsistent, poor use of actor talents, poor filming, poor direction, boring, gratuitous scenes with no purpose whatsoever, not even worth it for a collector's item. I rarely say this, but this is one film that should not be archived or preserved- waste of materials to produce.",1435104000,,327,5.074074074074074
