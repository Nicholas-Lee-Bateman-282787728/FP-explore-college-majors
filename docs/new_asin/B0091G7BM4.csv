5241791,5,B0091G7BM4,This movie is one that a star like John Wayne would have been proud to be in. Untill the end you are never sure who is the bad guy. The cinematography is superb. Who is this unknown writer? We have never heard of any of the crew but We are sure we will hear from them again,1351036800,3,273,3.807017543859649
5241792,5,B0091G7BM4,"This movie has won many awards at film festivals, and for good reason!  While it has the components of most westerns..cowboys, horses and guns...it also has a mysterious plot that keeps you guessing at the outcome, and of the motivations of each player.  This movie has a beautiful sound track, amazing scenery, and an intelligent plot, in addition to great action.  Not many movies these days care to go beyond popular actors and special effects. This one has it all. I highly recommend it.",1351036800,4,491,4.821428571428571
5241793,5,B0091G7BM4,"This is one of those movies that makes you want to go back and watch it again and again. There are so many twists and subtleties, you make new connections every time you see it! The viewer is kept guessing up until the end, and it's often hard to tell who is on which side. The production quality is fantastic, especially for an independent film. It is also one of the more historically accurate films in its genre. The music is all original and quite fitting; it complements every scene perfectly. You can tell that everyone involved really put their hearts into this production. If you're like me and you love movies that leave you thinking, ""Wow, I never expected that!"" then you will love this movie.",1351036800,3,704,4.551181102362205
5241794,5,B0091G7BM4,"I am not a fan of Westerns, but I heard that this one had some interesting twists, and it does! Kept me wondering and thinking all the way through. The plot is great, and the cinematography is beautiful. The historical research that must have gone into this film makes it all the more realistic. Typical shoot em up, but nothing gory, which I appreciated.",1350950400,5,355,4.5625
5241795,5,B0091G7BM4,"A great story of intrigue and suspense with surprising and deadly twists and turn around every corner.
It is refreshing to see what could be a dark western filmed in such a beautiful place. The contrast adds to the story as the whit and charm of the actors makes you cheer them on. The location and of course the horses leave you breathless. A film I will watch again and again.",1350950400,3,378,4.338028169014085
5241796,5,B0091G7BM4,This is a great film.  It has a very compelling story and was beautifully shot.  The ebb and flow between the characters is gripping and you will greatly enjoy watching.,1350950400,4,169,4.6
5241797,5,B0091G7BM4,"I was able to see an early screening of this must-see film. The characters are realistic and entertaining; the story line holds your interest to the very end. The story involves greed as the hunt for the hidden gold brings out the worst of human traits, and the action between the characters keeps you guessing about the outcome. It's shot as a western, but much more than that. The kind of story you talk about later - who was right and who was wrong? What were the motivations of the characters? The music holds intrigue and the scenery is beautiful.",1350950400,4,552,4.53
5241798,5,B0091G7BM4,This is not like any other western I have seen.  The dialog is unusual and funny and cinematography outstanding.  Pure entertainment!,1350950400,6,133,5.285714285714286
5241799,5,B0091G7BM4,"Got to view the premiere of this movie, HEATHENS AND THIEVES! Awesome story. Has won a number of awards at various film festivals, including Best Feature and Best Actress. Exciting!!",1348963200,7,182,5.1
5241800,4,B0091G7BM4,"The central plot in this somewhat unusual western is that several different groups of thieves are convinced that a Chinese family (heathens) stole gold and are hiding it somewhere on their ranch. One of the thieving groups is made up of two bearded men who are running from bounty hunters. One of these two men wants to help the Chinese woman, the other does not. He wants to kill her. Another group is made up of about a half dozen animal-like Mexican cutthroats led by a deranged ex-army colonel. Another, a single man, claims he is a marshal who lost his badge. Is he telling the truth? Still another is the town sheriff and his immature deputy. The Chinese man claims he has no gold; but is he telling the truth?
The Chinese wife has a bad past. She is not satisfied with her husband who bought her. She says she is attracted to the bearded man who wants to help her, but is she telling the truth?
The Chinese family is being held by all the groups who are trying to find the gold. The husband is tortured. There are many killings by knives and guns. The suspense is the film is: how will the problems be resolved?",1439424000,,1118,4.354066985645933

5241802,4,B0091G7BM4,"Wow, finally a good western. And I mean good on several levels, there is action and deception which brings about a few twist and turns in the plot. The acting was surprisingly good especially for a western. Then add a storyline which will not only hold your attention but keeps you guessing as to who the good guys really are. This is a movie that you can watch with the family. Very fast paced so no one will fall asleep, Zero Nudity and little strong language if any that I can remember. If you like westerns then this is one that you can sit back and enjoy the ride.",1420848000,2,569,4.229357798165138
5241803,5,B0091G7BM4,"Loved it. Really goes deep into human nature, self preservation, loyalty and honor.  I specialized in literature, taught creative writing at a college, not saying I'm an expert by any means, but, I saw a lot of great elements in this story. Also, the music created really seemed to capture the essence of the story also.  I've been watching every cowboy/indian movie I can find and would have to say this is in the top.",1420329600,,419,4.573333333333333

5241806,1,B0091G7BM4,"It's a B movie. B is for bad.

The acting is not engaging.

The fighting scenes look awkward, and stiff.

In short, there's nothing interesting about this movie. It's a waste of time and money.",1382486400,,193,4.457142857142857

5241808,4,B0091G7BM4,"A well-crafted Western with a good story and beautiful cinematography set in picturesque Northern California.  Excellent casting, with Don Swayze's magnificently intense performance alone worth getting this for.
Forget hi-tech special effects, space aliens, or train wrecks.  If you need that in your movie look elsewhere.  Just superb, cleverly written entertainment.  Buy it.",1361059200,,377,6.056603773584905
5241809,5,B0091G7BM4,Plot was predictable but ok to watch.  House and landscape was beautiful.  Scenes with horses were well done.  Actors were believable.,1360108800,,134,5.285714285714286

5241819,5,B0091G7BM4,A very good western peppered with unexpected and occasionally funny dialog.  Well worth watching!  Each actor played their role to the hilt.  You'll see what I mean when you watch it.,1357689600,,183,4.838709677419355
5241820,4,B0091G7BM4,"I just watched this film on dvd.  As it was filmed near my house, I was able to watch the making of it.  It's amazing to see it come together in such a beautiful, compelling package.  The story is very intriguing, the cinematography is stunning and the acting is excellent.  Gwendolyn Yeo and Don Swayze are definite stand outs.  Gwendeolyn Yeo is not only beautiful and talented, but a truly lovely person.  I hope to see more of her.  Kudos to the cast and crew!  I know this was a challenging, ""labor of love"" and it turned out great.",1357689600,,537,4.353535353535354
5241821,4,B0091G7BM4,"It started off a little slow, but once the action kicked in, this film was a heck of a ride! The story is a little challenging to grasp if you aren't paying attention, but it's a good one.  The look of the film really took you back to the Old West, without question. One unforseen bonus - Don Swayze's performance was rock-solid awesome! I'd like to see that guy get some more big-screen roles.",1357171200,,394,4.324324324324325
5241822,4,B0091G7BM4,"I have to admit that my husband and I (both avid Western movie fans) didn't expect much from this movie.  Having said that...I have to admit we both were pleasantly surprised.  The scenery was beautiful.  Don Swayze was really the star of the movie as the bad guy who wouldn't hesitate to kill to get what he wanted.  We've followed his acting since he played another villian in HIGH LONESOME and we both agree that his acting is getting better and better all the time.  He is dark, moody and rough enough to make his character totally evil.  I hate to see him type cast always as an evil guy and we'll be watching and waiting for his next movie (hopefully another Western)",1356998400,,673,4.430894308943089
5241823,1,B0091G7BM4,"I'm a big fan of Gwendoline Yeo, and I saw her film ""Heathens and Thieves"" when it premiered at the LA Film festival. I loved her performance so much that I wanted to purchase the DVD to keep as a souvenir. I was upset to find that she does not appear at all on the cover...just the male white actors. What good is my souvenir if her picture is not on it? It doesn't make it special to me or her fans. She was one of the leads in the film and played a key role, so I'm confused as to why she was not on there...especially when the plot and theme revolved around a Chinese couple. I would hate to think that because of her ethnicity, the DVD cover was released this way 'purposefully'. As a fan, I'm disturbed about it, but I'm wondering how the rest of the Asian community might respond to that. Being Asian myself, we are proud when we see another Asian actor/actress shine, and we will always be supportive. Gwendoline is a fine actress and she represents that, ""anything is possible regardless of ethnicity"". So to have her displayed on a cover is 'symbolic' for us. And the fact that she won 2 ""best actress"" awards for this film, makes me question this even more! Overall, she did a 4 star performance...unfortunately I'll have to give 1 star since I sense ""false"", if not racist marketing.",1356739200,,1295,4.355371900826446
5241824,3,B0091G7BM4,"If you're looking for a shoot em up kind of action explosion film, this is not for you.  It does have a Chinese element, not regularly seen in westerns, though Robert Duvall's Broken Trail can be touted to have done so first. Although if you are looking for a typical cowboy's mumblings, the lead actor mumbles away most of his dialogue which is highly frustrating. Though, Don Swayze (lead bad guy) and Gwendoline Yeo (lead damsel) are true stand outs and do the best they can in a highly dense, very complicated and lengthy plotted picture which leaves you wanting to watch the whole thing again to figure it all out - which on the one hand, shows complexity in the writing, but on the other hand, shows the writer's insecurity in introducing way too many characters and not enough time spent with each of them. To recap the plot - lead mumbler and his funny sidekick are grifters of sorts and stumble upon a ranch run by a Chinese couple who supposedly have hidden gold --  which in the late 1800's makes one cock an eye brow as Chinese weren't allowed to live in civility much less own land.  More bad guys come -- some more interesting then others like Swayze.  Amidst all this, there is some sexual tension with lead Chinese damsel, Yeo who seems to be a femme fatale of sorts, and it is refreshing to see  a unique character crafted here and well-executed.  All in all, a good effort, but it will be a film that  disappoints the low-brow western watcher,  and leave the intellectual of historical fiction wanting more...but not in a good way.",1356393600,2,1549,4.526881720430108
5241825,1,B0091G7BM4,"Heathens and Thieves is a highly original Western, a social commentary, a satire decrying racism, specifically the anti-Chinese practices in nineteenth century California, which ironically displays the very racism it decries. The cover of the DVD fails to feature its star actor: Gwendoline Yeo, an up and coming, extremely talented Chinese Singaporean actress, who appeared on Desperate Housewives -the only reason I attended the premiere of the movie. Miss Yeo's superby acting ability -her facial expressions and assumption of various accents and voice changes - literally made this movie, redeemed it, and yet she is not photographed on the advertisement. This is false advertising, as well as prejudice! The role assigned to her as a kind of attractive, pathetic ""bad girl"" supports the stereotype of the Asian woman as either every man's submissive, sweet dream or a Dragon Lady, and the obviously Eurasian baby who is supposed to be totally Chinese is a further insult, which I cannot explain without giving away the plot. Furthermore, the movie is very violent, too long, and too full of surprise, unlikely appearances of convoluted characters which detract from both the bitter humor and the moral impact of the story. I recommend seeing the movie only for Gwendoline Yeo's superb performance, and yet I feel it did her a grave injustice in both the insufficiently complex part and the lack of advertising it gave her.",1355788800,4,1427,5.181818181818182
5241826,5,B0091G7BM4,"This was a great western, wish there were more like this, really enjoyed it.
Would recommend this for anyone, even if they don't usually like Westerns.",1355270400,2,151,4.846153846153846
5241847,4,B0091G7BM4,"(1) No, we've never written reviews of videos/movies before.
(2) Yes, we have a connection - one of our friends is an investor, in memory of his brother.
(3) We enjoyed the movie at our friends' home, over dinner.  Didn't get the ""Noir"" feeling until we read the professional reviews. Don't understand the R rating that was on the DVD - the language was probably a bit ""soft"" for these types of characters; there was very little sex that would offend anything more than a 10 year old; and I don't remember any blood & guts but lots of shoot 'em up (as you expect in a good cowboy movie).
(4) ""Heathens & Thieves"" pretty much describes the characters - it's obvious who the hero is and part of the mystery is, what kind of person is he?
(5) Scenery and photography I think would be much more impressive on big screen, but it was good even on small. Special effects were limited (small budget, indie film) but believable. Surround sound had us looking behind us.
(6) I plan to give it to family members with 10 to 14 year old kids - I think it's appropriate.
(7) I read the other reviews - one guy (who panned it, based on the fact that the DVD didn't work and the You Tube trailer in the bar) seems only to want to argue.  Other reviews seemed to be reasonable.
(8) Is it the best out there? Probably not.  Is it worth the price? Probably.  Did you like ""There will be blood?""  Better story, better characters, less blood & gore.",1353888000,2,1428,4.313432835820896
5241848,3,B0091G7BM4,"Two thieves/ murders (Andrew Simpson, Richard Doyle) end up at the home of a China man (Boyuen) and his family during the anti-coolie period, although the exact date is a bit confusing. This appears to be post Civil War era, but from the dialouge the law which passed in 1862 was not yet enacted. Ignoring this fact, as it seems everyone has ignored it, the movie itself was different.

On the plus side the acting was good and the scenery, sets, and costumes seemed realistic enough. However, the film moves from a western into the ""home break-in genre"" with bad guys vs. bad guys, leaving us to root for Saul (Andrew Simpson) the nicest of the bad guys. The story revolves around some missing gold which people suspect is hidden at the China man's home. We end up with the two thieves, a US Marshall, some slim balls who who represent the poor banker, plus the sheriff and his sidekick. This was one of those films that seems to drag for some unexplained reason.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity. The ""R"" rating I think was a bit too much.",1353801600,,1052,4.50261780104712
5241849,4,B0091G7BM4,"This is a wonderful classic Western in the tradition of Sergio Leone and Lonesome Dove, happily updated for modern times without the awful racial stereotypes so common of this genre in the 40's through the 80's. While the bit-part Hispanic characters don't get to be much more than cardboard cutouts, overall this is a great film in the classic tradition that finally manages to portray the complexities of race and the post-Reconstruction New West without the usual Cowboys and Indians tropes. A post-millennial, post-racial Western that still evokes all of the wonderful noir and grit of its lineage without the redface, blackface, and yellowface that detracts from the originals. Up there with the Coen's True Grit reboot, Blackthorn, Deadwood, and Hell On Wheels. About damn time.",1353715200,3,784,5.23015873015873

I've watched thousands of Westerns (series and movies) since the early 60's and this may be one of the best acted ones ever. Open Range with Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall is on the same level.
