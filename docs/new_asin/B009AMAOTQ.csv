5300956,4,B009AMAOTQ,"Thats right. CBS films has brought together four incredibly gifted actors (in comedy and drama alike)Michael Douglas, Robert De Niro, Morgan Freeman, and Kevin Klineand places them right in the heart and soul of Sin City. While in Sin City, all four men will have encounters with all kinds of people: transvestites, male strippers, and nearly50 Cent!

Last Vegas stars Douglas as Billy, a bachelor nearing the age of seventy who, for the first time in his life, is finally tying the knot. His fiance, Lisa (Bre Blair) loves him dearlyand is only in her early thirties!

Yes, with Last Vegas, you have a role that fits Michael Douglas like a glove. Not much is mentioned of his Billy Ghersons career, but when I saw Douglas/Gherson over the phone in one of Last Vegas opening scenes; it looked like they were making Gherson a Gordon Gekko of Malibu, California! Not sure, but even if its a coincidence, its a hilarious one.

So what does a Gordon Gekko-like figure do right before he ties the knot?

Answer: he forgets hes nearly seventy and treats himself like a young child to the city of Las Vegas! Vegas are Billy Ghersons choice of wedding location, and bachelor partywell, parties!

And Mr. Gherson is not the only old man getting into trouble. Accompanying him is two of his best friendsand one estranged friend.

The estranged friend is Paddy (De Niro), and it is Paddy who is the center of Last Vegas drama. Paddy, one year earlier, lost his beloved wife Sophie and lives alone, being accompanied only by an annoying resident of his apartment who serves him tasteless food. But that isn't Paddys biggest problem. His biggest problem is that his childhood best friend Billy Gherson refused to attend Sophies funeraland, time and time again, has only given Paddy excuses for not coming. Its going to take literal manipulation to get Paddy to comebut he comes, mostly as the rain on Billy Ghersons parade.

The one who convinces Paddy to come is Archie (Freeman), who beautifully unleashes his diverse talent of comedy and drama (mostly comedy) into one package. Archie is the true rebel out of Billy Ghersons Rat Pack, sneaking away from and lying to his family to come to Las VegasAFTER becoming bedridden following a stroke, no matter how mild!

Last, but certainly not least, is Kevin Klines Sam. Sams adventure is, by far, the funniest: a man who thinks 50 Cent was one of the Jackson Five (remember, his legal name is Curtis Jackson) and comes to Las Vegas looking for infidelity: AT THE PERMISSION OF HIS OWN WIFE!!!

The eye candy, meanwhile, for Sam, Archie, Paddy, and even Billy is Diana (Mary Steenburgen), a Las Vegas club singer who wins the hearts of manyand becomes a source of competition for, most notably; you guessed itPaddy and Billy!

So how does Last Vegas measure up?

Ignoring the profanity, and separating film from reality, Last Vegas is one hilarious ride from top to bottom. The material itself is very profound, and the actors go hand-in-hand with it. We see actors with infamous dark sides, most notably Michael Douglas and Robert De Niro, going at each others throats. The greatest match, however, is De Niro and Kevin Kline. Together, De Niro and Kline feed off each others backs, Kline as the protagonist and De Niro as the antagonist. Kline serves as De Niros mediator throughout the majority of Last Vegas, and even though Kline serves humorously as De Niro serves seriously, the pair still manages to go hand-in-hand likeyou guessed it, spaghetti and meatballs!

I found the performances of De Niro and Douglas to be the most profound, with the personal connection Douglas has to his character, and De Niro combining the dark and comedic sides that made us love him in films like Raging Bull and Meet the Parents! De Niros Paddy character, at times, makes Last Vegas feel like a soap opera. The drama itself, however, is necessary for the honesty of Last Vegasand leads to a very satisfying ending. Even when we get annoyed with Paddy, De Niro keeps us watching, in a performance worthy of a Golden Globe or even Academy Award.

One of the very best comedies of 2013.",1387324800,8,4109,4.762306610407876
5300957,3,B009AMAOTQ,"Four kids who called themselves ""The Flatbush Four"" reunite in Las Vegas as they approach 70. In the case of art imitating life Billy (Michael Douglas) is marrying a woman (Bre Blair) in her 30's. He is joined by Sam (Kevin Kline) whose wife has given him permission to cheat; Archie (Morgan Freeman) whose son keeps him prisoner at home; and Paddy (Robert De Niro) who is lured by a false pretense. He has had a falling out with Billy, something which weighs heavy into the plot to the point of killing it. In Vegas, they meet a savvy nightclub singer (Mary Steenburgen) who they describe as ""Mrs. Don Rickles."" She occasionally joins the group.

The film seems as old as the actors. An example of the humor:

Sam brags about his wife giving him permission to cheat as he talks to a young girl. She asks, ""Are you good in bed?""

Sam: ""I don't remember.""

That is the pinnacle of the type of humor to expect. The situations lack the expected humor and the rift between the two main characters is confusing as the film attempts to be a comedy and a drama. It doesn't work well as either. Mary Steenburgen had a great character that was under used.

The all-star cast did well with a tired script. Works as a rental. I wouldn't rush out to see it.

5300958,5,B009AMAOTQ,"It's the buddy-road-trip movie for the boomers. Four old friends (with some old issues between) them take off for a raucous weekend in Sin City. The emphasis here is on ""old"" - but the 60-70 crowd still has plenty of life left in them. An improbable stroke of luck near the start of their outing makes wild extravagance almost plausible, but that just makes it more fun. Things like over-attentive adult children, mid-life (maybe late-life) crises, getting back to wild times after a few decades of married peace and quiet, sorrow and recovery from being widowed - all carried off flawlessly. And, it doesn't hurt to be reminded that ""retired"" and ""dead"" are different words for good reason. Every decade is a good one, or can be, just not all in the same ways.

BTW, if someone pans the movie, check whether they're under 50. If so, they just might not have enough life behind them to appreciate what's going on.

5300959,4,B009AMAOTQ,"What a cast! And directed by Jon Turteltaub (""National Treasure"" and ""While You Were Sleeping""). How can we lose? Well....

Three old buddies want to throw a bachelor party for their last single pal, so off to Vegas they go! This geriatric PG-13 fling looks at what happens in Vegas and what probably should have stayed there. Too many bikinis, too many gyrating bottoms, too many prostate jokes, too many strobe lights, and too many silicone bosoms, but the strength of a long-time friendship ultimately endures.

Look at this outdated Rat Pack and their cohorts:
  * Robert De Niro (""The Family"") is Paddy, a guy who is still in mourning for his wife. This pugnacious guy can really hold a grudge...
  * Morgan Freeman (""Oblivion"") Archie has packed his pill case and has programmed his cell phone to remind him to take his meds.
  * Michael Douglas (""Behind the Candelabra"") is Billy with the fake tan and the fake hair, never married, never really wanted to... ...except that once....
  * Kevin Kline (""Darling Companion"") when Sam is given a Get Out of Jail Free card from his wife, opportunities beckon.
  * Mary Steenburgen (""30 Rock"") if Diana ever makes it big in show biz, she will be the first to be surprised.
  * Romany Malco (lots of TV) Lonnie will always cater the best party for the biggest tipper.
  * Jerry Ferrara (""Think Like a Man"") Dean really blew it, so our heroes make him think he has offended the Mob!

Eventually this bawdy and profane outing began to wear on me. I'm not a big fan of insult humor or the ogling of young bodies, so despite laughing out loud a few times, I found myself wondering what Dan Fogelman (""Crazy, Stupid, Love"") had in mind when he wrote the script: Comedy? Drama? Social commentary on aging? Hmmm....

This is a pleasant way to spend 105 minutes, but you won't remember much about it in a couple of days. Amazon will notify me when the DVD is available so I can let my JayFlix.net people know.",1383264000,3,1949,4.567723342939481

We tried to watch about 6 times, it stalled several times and in different scenes, which is extremely frustrating.  Who wants to watch a defective movie often?  It took us 8 months to try to watch more times, hopefully it would get better with our newe DVD player, but it's too late to return it now.  We bought another one which is perfect.

All four of them are far above this kind of over-the-hill gang, tripe. So I ask you gentleman: as portrayed in this film for our age group, would any of you go out of your way to hit the town and paint your face red in an all out effort to prove early senility? Jesus God, what a horrible waist, and an insult to all of we older gents; not to mention our intellects. I knew what I was getting into before I began watching, but Ive always loved all four of these actors, but it was far worse than I could ever have expected.

5303652,4,B009AMAOTQ,"Five Academy Award winners including Mary Steenburgen as a Binions lounge singer from Atlanta, Georgia a; Robert Deniro as widowed Paddy from Brooklyn, New York; Michael Douglas as lifelong Billy living in Malibu, California; Morgan Freeman as Archie living in Englewood, New Jersey with his son's family; and Kevin Kline as a married retiree in Naples, Florida. They get together when Billy announces his wedding plans in Las Vegas.

The film has some flaws with writing but the film is entertaining to watch with an all star cast. The film is set and shot on location in Las Vegas. If you love Las Vegas, you love watching this film with great shots of the Aria Hotel and Casino and Binions on Fremont Street.

The friends give a bachelor party to remember the night before Billy's wedding. The DVD extras just include about why working together for the first time.

This film wasn't about winning awards but about friendship and comedy. Sometimes films should be about entertaining and making us laugh and feel good about ourselves.",1442102400,,1035,4.902857142857143

5303764,5,B009AMAOTQ,"So, I saw the previews for this movie a while back and thought it looked like a potentially funny movie.  I had it on my list to get and then I completely forgot about for a while.  Then, I ran across an article talking about Robert De Niro and came across this again.  I watched the previews and remembered that I was going to watch it and took a chance on buying it.  OMG this was SOOOOOO much funnier than I thought it was going to be!  Of course, it's a toss up on whether my grandparents will find it as funny... but having to deal with elderly people all the time I found that some of the quirks that they have were VERY well portrayed in this movie.

I think I laughed more in this movie than most of the funny movies that I have seen in the past 5 years.  That could mean that I haven't really seen a lot of funny movies lately but I really think that it means the quality of this movie is VERY good.  The best part is... I can let my grandparents watch it and not feel too embarrassed by some of the ""crude"" remarks.  Don't get me wrong... there are some borderline inappropriate comments and words that I wouldn't want my children to repeat, but they weren't so bad that I felt like hiding the movie and keeping it away from other family members.

Now, I'm a big fan of all four of these actors so I might have been a little more forgiving on some of the annoying parts (like one or more whining parts) but overall I really liked the movie.  It will probably be one that I watch at least a few times but no matter what, I am VERY glad that I purchased it finally!",1440460800,2,1573,4.074675324675325

5303827,4,B009AMAOTQ,"When you take the plots of two successful movie franchises, and blend them into one, often the results are mixed, but this time, thanks to an all-star cast, The Hangover meets Grumpy Old Men in Last Vegas, and the results are hilarious. Billy (Michael Douglas) is 70 years old and about to marry a college student. While he seems content with his new life, he desires one last vacation with his three best friends from the old neighborhood. Reluctantly putting aside old quarrels, the men meet in Las Vegas for Billy's bachelor party, and once things get going, these guys prove that they are anything but over the hill. It's hard to go wrong with a cast of Academy Award winners that have literally hundreds of films under their belts, but a film like Last Vegas really does come down to the writing. If it's not hilarious, in the eyes of the audience, the cast will seem as over the hill as their characters. Thankfully, that wasn't the case, as simply the chemistry between these guys leads to some hilarious moments, that I'd be willing to bet were completely unscripted. Each actor brings their own unique style and brand of humor to the part and when they finally come together in Las Vegas, this film takes off. It isn't an exaggeration to say that this is one of the funniest films I've seen all year. Just the guys reaction to the things associated with modern day Las Vegas, like the technology, thugs, rap music, and strippers is absolutely priceless. The ancient cast and a PG-13 rating turned a lot of people off to this film, but the cast is a complete throw back trapped in a modern party town, leading to some epic scenes. Last Vegas is an absolute comedy gem, that somehow fell under most peoples radars, but it is every bit as good as the Hangover was, and maybe even more so, thanks to the experience of the cast and their tremendous chemistry.",1440028800,,1863,4.564179104477612

5303832,5,B009AMAOTQ,"I'm the 1964th person to review this film. I give it Five Stars simply because I liked the storyline and all of the actors. They are Hall of Fame actors each with an Academy Award on their mantles!

I loved seeing the relationship that these four men had together. I loved how they all remained friends throughout the years but I really wanted to know more about their family lives. Did Kline and his wife ever have kids? What about DeNiro's character? Douglas's character was a bachelor all his life so we know that he never had kids. This is a film that men will enjoy. Women won't enjoy it as much but would do well to view it to understand male psychology.

I like that the film has an 80% Rating on Amazon. Four out of Five Stars ain't bad. But it sure as hell beats Three Stars! Even though I'm much younger than these actors and/or the characters they played, I feel I can identify with them and hope to be at their level when I get to their age. I'm glad that I bought this DVD and I highly recommend it to anyone reading my review.

5303883,5,B009AMAOTQ,"This is a very nice sometimes emotional story of four friends who grew up together, who are now aged. One is rich and is about to marry a woman some thirty years younger than him. He invites his three friends to Vegas for a bachelor party before the wedding. One is a disgruntled dissatisfied man who strongly dislikes his old friend the rich guy because when his (the disgruntled guy's) wife died, he did not come to the funeral. We are not told why at the start of the film. One is somewhat sickly or so he acts and so he is treated by his son who loves him. The fourth has sexual problems and his wife gives him a condom, suggests he have sex in Vegas and it may save their marriage of some forty years. While the disgruntled guy does not want to come, he is finally persuaded to do so. The four get into a number of adventures which are fun to watch. One is that the sick guy wins over $120,000 at the casino. Another is that they are mistaken for gangsters.",1436745600,2,962,4.17741935483871

And then Michael Douglas' character was going to marry a much younger woman, even though she was very nice and seemed very mature, but everyone treated him like he was a freak.

5304285,5,B009AMAOTQ,We saw this movie while on vacation and we really enjoyed it--it is funny and heart warming.  I especially liked it because it is a story about older adults having the time of their lives.  Seldom get to see older adults (men or women) as stars in the movies.  Hope there are more films like this one that will come out with older women.  Love It!!!,1429747200,,349,4.242424242424242

5304387,4,B009AMAOTQ,"I was having a bad arthritis day and wanted something to make me laugh.  This worked.  If we had bought the video, not rented it, I would have watched it again to see what I missed.  Some scenes were so crammed with people and things happening, it was hard to process.  The casino conversation was hard to follow with such a noisy background (told you we were codgers.)  so I needed my ""interpreter"" for some of it. Also had to throw away my critic's hat as the plot was not particularly well done, but there were a few nice twists. We relaxed, we laughed and we related to some of the situations. We forgot our aches and pains for a couple of hours.  I met Michael Douglas in person when he was 16 and I was 21.  Yep, that makes me about 104 yrs old now.  The point is, kids, you will be here yourself before you know it.  Hold your friends close, say what you mean and follow your heart.  Try not to do anything too stupid if you can help it.

I did not think it was anything special as road trip movies go. Morgan Freeman does his usual bangup job. DeNiro does a good job as well. Michael Douglas's character came off as pompous and slimy to me especially after he ditched his wife to be and took up with a woman he met while in Vegas.

This is PAID content, why should I have to watch commercials with paid content? I don't want to watch commercials or previews. All the functions on my Sony Blu-ray player remote that could skip or fast forward the commercials were deactivated; pressing them would get operation not allowed. No menu's, skips, or fast forward options. This reminds me of an episode of Black Mirror ""Fifteen Million Merits"" where the guy didn't want to watch the commercials on his screen but could not bypass them and was forced to watch them with an annoying 'resume viewing, resume viewing, resume viewing'. When he tried to leave his bedroom he got the message 'portal disabled during commercial'. Some people believe the solution is to leave the set on mute and come back 10 minutes later.

5304815,1,B009AMAOTQ,"This review is not about the movie but Sony. I am appalled the audacity these companies have.

I put the disc in to watch the movie and was forced to watch some UltraViolet advertisement from Sony. No buttons worked or chapter skipping, etc.
Then it proceeded to show me the trailers for new Sony movies. Every time I tried to skip and go to the menu nothing happened then stopping it would go to the beginning and play the UltraViolet thing again.
After 10 mins back and forth I ejected the disc never to buy a Sony Movie again.

We buy these because were buying the movie to watch, not all this other stuff. If you want to put it in fine but make it optional. We are already watching TV with 50% commercials, we cannot watch a news video online without some 30 second ad. ENOUGH!

Anyway, Sony you need to stop forcing advertising on us if we buy the movie. Locking down the top menu buttons is pathetic and works against them.",1419724800,2,929,4.327586206896552

5305152,4,B009AMAOTQ,"Last Vegas is a comedy about four old men who have been friends for close to sixty years who decide to throw a bachelor party for the only one of them who has remained single that is planning to get married. This is a film that focuses on many themes like friendship,unresolved issues,marriage and old age. Despite the fact that is has 4 legendary actors in Michael Douglas,Robert De Niro,Morgan Freeman and Kevin Kline,the screenplay was obviously far from original and refreshing as it was basically about four old people having a good time in Vegas. Added to that,the story offers nothing really new as it was predictable and refreshing for even the resolution to the conflict between Billy and Paddy and whom Diana is going to end up with between the two can be seen a mile away. But nevertheless,it provides encouragement and many reasons for old men to enjoy their life to the fullest as the four main characters here party like wild animals at Vegas.",1413763200,,957,4.7023809523809526

5305316,5,B009AMAOTQ,The majority of comedies or rom/coms simply don't appeal to me. I'm 40 so I'm kind of between Michael Douglas and the rest of the group and the twenty somethings you usually see in comedies. Needless to say I'm finding the older I get the more I can relate to the first group. I found the movie hysterical. Everyone turns in a solid performance with a story that had plenty of heart and laughs. Recommended if you think us old people are funny. :),1412553600,3,447,4.333333333333333

5306348,5,B009AMAOTQ,"My husband and I had a great time watching this movie.  We are young enough to see the kids perspective and old enough to appreciate the 60/70 year old perspective.

Robert De Niro was brilliant as a love sick widower.  The pictures of his wife all over the apartment was a nice touch.  I bet there are a lot of widowers who follow suit now that the idea has been planted.

Michael Douglas seemed almost a bit too much himself.  An older man who is marrying a woman half his age....needless to say he plays himself extremely well.  Just teasing.  Michael was great and he played the shallow guy with a deep inside very well.  He made the character incredibly likeable.

Morgan Freeman as Archie is the grandfather everyone wants.  His scene where he runs away was hilarious.

Kevin Kline...this one threw me.  Picturing Kevin as an old fuddy duddy who's wife is tired of him being unhappy and giving him a free pass (a condom, a blue pill and the promise that what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas) ...well let's just say that is a character role I would never have pictured him in but he did a marvelous job.

The other actors were all great. Mary Steenburgen as the older love interest...still hot.  Joanna Gleason and Kevin's wife...love the scene when she drops Kevin off at the airport.  Roger Bart is great as Madonna. And Romany Malco was priceless when he was showing off the room in Vegas to the gentlemen.

I will be fair the script was pretty cheesy but it was fun and the actors are marvelous.  So grab something to drink.  Pop some popcorn.  Sit back and just have fun.",1402790400,4,1581,4.461538461538462

It was a great movie with plenty of ""laugh out loud"" moments. There is a predictable happy ending with some unexpected twists and turns to get there. Definately worth the money.",1402358400,,298,4.4363636363636365

5306412,2,B009AMAOTQ,"But some of the scenes in the trailer were so funny, like Morgan Freeman's escape out the window.  I could throw out the ""guy stuff"" and settle with the general plot of the relationship between the guys from childhood on.  If I had realized certain scenes and content would have been in it I would not have rented it.  Despite my huge dislike for certain things in the movie - these ""guys"" and Mary Steenbergen always seem to deliver their roles.  We could have stopped watching it at one point, but after renting it and starting it, I wanted to see how it turned out between the guys and the lady.  And, the poor guy who believed their con was funny.  I wish movies could leave out some things though.  It goes with when I visited Vegas some years ago on a company trip, I went with several friends who preferred the Grand Canyon to what Vegas had to offer. So, I'm just sayin'.  Oh yes - there's a scene in the movie with all the old familiar landmark signs of Vegas, the ones I saw in my grandparents photos years and years ago.  That was cool.",1402358400,,1047,4.274111675126903
5306413,1,B009AMAOTQ,"This is a goofy dumb movie. Great actors with a terrible script, embarrassing humor, useless plot, poor directing. This film is made for people with extremely bad and poor taste.

First we teach the young to be stupid, now we teach old be stupid too. This film is one of the reasons why many men go through mid to end life crisis and depression. It's mass media culture that defines having fun as being young, dumb and full of lust. The mainstream's vision that everyone needs to value being young, crazy, drunk, stupid, and full of sexy women. As men and boys grow older the find worthlessness in aging, holding on to memories of being an unintelligent adolescent they don't have any self value as they mature. They'll have trouble functioning in married old life. Partial reason to go cheat and find self depreciation through being selfish and materialistically immature. This film can't just value growing older and wiser, makes people respect themselves less, and put fear into the aging process. In a commercial culture that fears growing older/wiser we Teach the world to treasure a soulless adolescent life. Men have trouble adapting to each important stage of life and making it the fullest: marriage, parenthood, post parenthood and more. There's better ways of having fun rather than being drunk, young and partying and watching bad movies like last Vegas. People who love this movie will surely face the most pain in the aging process. Men bonding on such shallow surface level fun will eventually find losing more and more friends in an aging process as they realize people don't value their poor purposeless soul.",1402358400,3,1626,4.912727272727273
5306414,4,B009AMAOTQ,"I give it 4 stars because the movie was worthy of laughter. So many comedies now rely only on slapstick/stupid jokes, but Last Vegas managed to bring laughs to the surface that haven't been there in a while.",1402358400,,207,4.473684210526316

It is in Las Vegas so what do you expect? What happens there stays there - but when it is on a movie it is funny. All of the actors are very good. It is great to see them all together for what may be an only event. I give the movie 4.5 stars which is 5 when you round up.,1402272000,,445,3.505050505050505

5306453,3,B009AMAOTQ,"Last Vegas is about four childhood friends now in their 70s reuniting again in Las Vegas. With its Hangover-like premise, the comedy is nothing special except the fact that these four guys are played by Robert De Niro, Michael Douglas, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Kline. With Mary Steenburgen in a supporting role, Last Vegas has five Oscar winners. This is remarkable, isn't it?

Unfortunately, the filmmakers didn't come up with a good story for these veteran players. The ideas of these guys throwing a bachelor party and joining in a swimsuit competition as a judge are too weak to sustain the films running time. Directed by Jon Turteltaub (National Treasure) and written by Dan Fogelman (Crazy, Stupid, Love.), Last Vegas has potential for more compelling drama or funny comedy, neither of which the film simply isnt.

Still, there is one good thing about the film: obviously the stars are having fun. Watching them having a good time is not a bad thing. That alone doesn't really make for an enjoyable comedy, though.",1402012800,,1021,4.930232558139535

Four school yard chums reconnect in their twilight years. They aim to celebrate the bachelor party of the last of their band to get hitched. They each have their own burdens to shrug off, but before they do, theyll need to dehumanize some surgically enhanced women.

What did I think?

Hollywood loads four of their best into the chamber and fires ageist and misogynistic bullets into the corpse of the Dude Adventure story. What were they thinking? I mean, Morgan Freeman was in Shawshank Redemption for Christs sake!

The film ties together like a jigsaw puzzle with numbered pieces. I could tell you most of the stories ten minutes in. But just when you think its irredeemable, Robert De Niro and Kirk Douglas show you just why they've been in the business for so long and manage to inject maybe not heart, but at least some still-warm blood into this hollow cadaver.

It had hilarious moments, touching moments, sad moments and a whole lot of fun!

We laughed from start to finish but to us it never felt like one of those shallow comedy's that are so popular right now (which I also like and watch but want something different now and then.)

We would watch again, as we really enjoyed it! Would definitely recommend to any age group (we are late 20's).",1401580800,,629,4.396551724137931

Humor,.. in continuing on, in spite of the losses that aging brings us all. As life's journey continues, we adjust, reflect and laugh! Seasoned actors who I grew up being entertained by. Special kudos to Michael Douglas, who returns to the screen, after weathering the storms of life with great dignity in the public eye.",1401235200,,449,4.625

5306537,4,B009AMAOTQ,"This was a little bit of surprise, but my whole family enjoyed the movie. Something there for almost everyone. All the actors bring a unique flavor to the movie, and there are the ever present aging issues which created much humor.",1401148800,,231,4.658536585365853

All conflict will be resolved somewhere in the last 15 minutes, and everything will be tied up in a nice bow.

All four main actors are on cruise control.  Don't remind yourself that the Robert DeNiro in this movie is the same one that was in Raging Bull, or the Michael Douglas in this film was in China Syndrome and Wall Street.  Kevin Kline plays against type....he has facial hair and is funny.  At least Morgan Freeman doesn't narrate this.

It's fine.  It's completely forgettable.  The Vegas backdrop is nice.  If you want something that makes you feel good at the end and then forget about 15 minutes later, this is for you.",1400716800,,809,4.442176870748299

5306718,5,B009AMAOTQ,I don't know why this movie didn't make a bigger splash on the big screen.  I found it funny and touching.  My 30-something sons also enjoyed this movie.  The characters are likeable and it has some unexpected turns of events.  The best part for me is that it has a satisfying ending.  My husband and I thoroughly enjoy this movie and will want to watch it over and over.,1399420800,,371,4.318840579710145

5306845,5,B009AMAOTQ,"It is a good comedy without a lot of over-the-top slapstick humor. I liked Morgan Freeman best of the four leading actors. I think his timing & delivery, plus his facial expressions, lent more to his character than either Douglas or De Niro.
Robert Klein seems to be Robert Klein no matter what role he plays. You almost forget who he is and what is his role.

5306858,2,B009AMAOTQ,There may be a lot of big names in the film but it really had no plot. It was depressing because it was about not being able to do the things you used to do when you were younger. I personally don't like programs about aging.,1398556800,,225,3.9130434782608696

5306863,5,B009AMAOTQ,It was a fun and entertaining movie with the top actors in Hollywood.  Husband chuckled off and on but my daughter and I laughed out loud during the movie.

5306864,5,B009AMAOTQ,"My husband and I watched this on a date night and truly enjoyed it. The characters are not treated as idiots, there's not a bunch of stupid misunderstandings, and the store line moves forward at a nice pace. (Although, I do wonder at their ability to recover from a hangover so quickly. I know I can't.) Solid humor shows it's face and they all seem to enjoy the movie.",1398470400,,369,4.36231884057971

5306879,3,B009AMAOTQ,"Ok, I love each one of these actors..have watched
them all for years and they have never let me down.
But honestly, it belabored the point in too many places and
for too long each time..It needs at least 20 min. cut out and less close
ups of Douglas and I say that will love but come on..I would
have liked to have pulled the makeup person aside and said.
Please for godsake stop putting white on the lower eye lids of Douglas
and pull the camera back. It's totally out of kindness I say this..someone
was not watching out for him in this one..Otherwise, it's a fun movie.",1398384000,,572,4.256880733944954

5306884,3,B009AMAOTQ,This movie is relatively funny but definitely not for children. It would be funnier to those who are older although our twenty somethings liked it.,1398211200,,147,4.92

5306899,5,B009AMAOTQ,"I wasn't sure I would like this movie but I do admire all of the actors in it so I bought it anyway.  The story line is so typical of an aging group of men, away from home, on their own, and free to do whatever, whenever, and however they wanted and that did not end up being nearly as exciting and fun as they thought.  It turned out to be a lesson in learning what life is really about.  Steenbergen is charming in this movie and the part she played would not have been nearly as interesting if someone else had gotten the role.",1398211200,,530,4.0285714285714285

5306906,3,B009AMAOTQ,"First, w-a-a-a-a-a-y too long.  Here are five Oscar winners:  DeNiro, Freeman, Douglas, and Kline in an awful movie.  They must
have all owed a favor to the producer and/or director.  Admittedly, there were a few scenes that were funny, a very few.
Sorry, guys, I'd rather rent or stream ""Godfather II,"" ""Wall Street,"" ""A Fish Called Wanda,""  (it's k-k-k-ken....), and even ""March of

5306935,3,B009AMAOTQ,This was a funny movie about old chums getting together in Las Vegas with the same sort of expectations that one expects to happen.  No surprises.  The only really good part was the pairing of these guys and their individual talents.,1397865600,,233,4.658536585365853

5306969,3,B009AMAOTQ,"What a joy to see a movie where the leads are mature, both male and female, and aren't pictured as simply grandparents.

On the other hand, the movie  shows that guys who were friends as boys can quickly revert to their adolescent ways even in their 60s and 70s.  Mary Steenburgen, on the other hand, demonstrates that being mature and fun aren't mutually exclusive.  She is a delight.",1397692800,,385,4.617647058823529

5306975,4,B009AMAOTQ,I really enjoyed this movie.  I laughed through out the entire film.  I was empressed there were no nude scenes and very little questionable language.  It didn't need ant of that.,1397606400,,179,4.709677419354839
5306976,3,B009AMAOTQ,"I enjoyed it as I like all the actors. They've been acting so long and are so relaxed, they make their work look effortless. I'm not a big fan of Vegas as I hate losing money and it's too hot for me, but for those who like the city and the actors and comedies, they'll probably enjoy the film. One of the characters takes alot of ribbing as he's engaged to a woman nearly half his age, but I'm so used to famous actors of a certain age marrying much younger women, that that story element didn't seem a big deal to me, and I didn't really think men would give their men friends a hard time about marrying much younger in real life, probably congratulate him. The characters had health issues which I could relate to, but it was nice to see older characters kicking up their heels abit. One of the character's wives gave him permission to cheat on her during the Vegas trip, which I didn't find believable - just have never heard of a wife giving her husband permission to cheat at a bachelor party, though do concede it is possible and of course I know some people have open marriages. 2 and 3/4 stars rounded up to 3, mostly for the acting. Mary Steenbergen sang nicely. Men might enjoy this film more than I did as it features many young, partially clothed women.",1397606400,,1265,4.319327731092437

5306979,4,B009AMAOTQ,Cute movie. Predictable in a lot of ways but sometimes you just want a movie that entertains and a lot of thought doesn't have to go into viewing it. Just fun and entertaining.,1397520000,,176,4.363636363636363
5306980,4,B009AMAOTQ,"I loved it. Fun, silly, hilarious. Definitely worth the rental. Any of these guys are great aone. I was pleasantly surprised how great they were together.

Michael Douglas -- Billy in the movie -- have known a girl for a while but she was merely 32, but Billy proposed to her, and she agreed, and they would get married the coming Sunday.

But due to some friends wanting to get together before the marriage, Billy met a woman and their interaction was like 2 hours, and both Billy and Robert De Niro -- Paddy -- both immediately fell in ""love"" with her.  Billy said he found the ""most beautiful woman he has ever met"" in the past 70 years.  Billy then didn't marry the young girl, and would marry the one he met in that 2 days.

Also, at first, Paddy didn't want to go to Vegas, Morgan Freeman -- Archie -- pretended that he was so out of breath and almost like dying and beg Paddy to go, and Paddy felt so bad about it and he went.  And then when Paddy went pack for the luggage, Archie was like standing and smiling, and showing a victory gesture.  So I think it teaches the public, whatever you want to achieve, do whatever you want to get it, including deception.  Just do whatever to get what you want.",1396828800,2,1102,4.18957345971564

5307198,4,B009AMAOTQ,"I liked this, the guys 'get outta town' to Las Vegas, film directed by Jon Turteltaub.  Sure, it had the usual trappings that you may be expecting. After all, it's the bachelor party weekend for their last friend who hasn't ever been married, Billy (Michael Douglas).  Paddy (Robert De Niro) still harbors angry feelings toward Billy but went along anyway. Along with these two are Sam (Kevin Kline) and Archie (Morgan Freeman).  These men have been friends since their childhood of titled renowned and remained tight all of these years.

You are going to see and hear the full atmosphere of today's Las Vegas as in this is as big as another character foregoing just any other place. From the showgirls, loud music, and luck playing Black Jack, it's a Vegas that demands you have four strong characters and they are all here together. There is a couple of things included that I didn't expect like the lovely Torch Singer, Diana (Mary Steenburgen), who sings in one of the lesser casinos.  It is interesting as she is closer to these gentlemen's ages, which is totally unlike Billy's 31'ish' fiance. One could guess that she could be his daughter. The time and place he proposed to her is oddly unexpected, to say the least while Diana spends a lot of time with them and she seems to have a way of communicating with each one in a different and special manner.

There is a subplot running along concerning the relationship between Paddy and Billy. Paddy is bitter over something that Billy has done.  He will neither let up about it nor let him forget it. I won't get into it any further except to say that it does add more depth, and some comedy, to the movie. A bit more than what you may be expecting. One nice touch is how the film also looks at the concerns of life and at getting older. The story begins with these men as boys some 58 years prior to the present time.  They were friends then - before the film jumps ahead to the present.  You do get to see these four boys from Brooklyn as youngsters, calling themselves, ""The Flatbush Four"".

This is an easy movie to watch and enjoy. The cast works very well together and certainly does not disappoint.  It does not delve into any deep social issues, isn't cerebral so you will not end up thinking about it over and over later.  On the other hand, it is a movie to just put on when you feel like some laughs for a while and also to let yourself exhale from all of our life's issues.  For this reason, among some others, I thought ""Last Vegas"" was well worth the watch.",1396396800,5,2526,4.453362255965293

5307221,4,B009AMAOTQ,"I'm not sure if this story is anything earth shattering,  a bunch of old guys, life long friends get together to have some fun and to resolve a few lingering issues.  What makes the movie so good is that you have four of the best actors in Hollywood knocking it out of the park.  It's like watching the NBA all star dunk competition.",1396310400,,333,4.253968253968254

5307223,3,B009AMAOTQ,"With this great cast I expected a little more from this movie.  Having said that, I would still recommend it to someone looking for a few laughs and to see a few movie icons working together.  The characters are formulaic (the driven entrepreneur who didn't have time for a family, the mourning widower, etc.) but there are worse ways to spend a couple of hours.",1396310400,,362,4.553846153846154

5307268,4,B009AMAOTQ,Poignant in so many spots as the characters review their lives as they are approaching old age but hilarious throughout.  Morgan Freeman is a Gem!,1396224000,,146,4.84

5307270,2,B009AMAOTQ,"It was really a lot fun seeing these guys together, but the script and story line are clearly mediocre.  At times, it felt as if I were viewing a bunch of disjointed skits pasted together without any rhyme or reason. Additionally, there were no real belly laughs or creative visual gags such as to be found in most other Las Vegas ""Bromance"" films. The attempts at sentimentality were also much too corny to be believed, and the smut factor was pretty dismal if your taste happens to run towards raunchy humor.  Finally, the blatant product placements for the Aria Hotel and Southwest Airlines were quite annoying and distracting.",1396224000,,630,4.824074074074074

5307273,5,B009AMAOTQ,"This is the best comedy movie I have seen in years.  I would rate it a 4.5 of 5.  Well worth the watch.

The cast delivers an outstanding performance, the writing was well crafted, and the comedic moments of the film were shown with just as much class as the heartfelt moments.  Also, in a pleasant departure from recent comedy offerings, the movie didn't feel the need to be overly profane, raunchy, or ""super-sexual"" just because the movie takes place in Las Vegas and involves a bachelor party.

Though the actors had never worked with each other previously, Michael Douglas, Robert De Niro, Morgan Freeman, and Kevin Kline did a fantastic job of portraying life-long friends.  The interactions between the stars displayed all of the loving concern, no-holds-barred insults, and trash-talk you would expect from men that have been friends since childhood.

Though the ""advertised"" story is that of four friends in their late-sixties traveling to Las Vegas to have a bachelor party, the true premise is that of the binding friendship shared by them over six decades.  Billy (Douglas) is a lifelong bachelor who is finally getting married, Archie (Freeman) a grandfather smothered at home by his overprotective son, Sam (Kline) a married man of 40 years in a stagnant relationship with his wife, and Paddy (De Niro) a widower pining for his deceased wife (a woman for which Billy also had feelings).

I won't say that the movie had ""twists and turns"" as I believe a lot of the plot points were predictable (as many comedies are), but the ride to get to the plot's conclusion was what made this movie truly good.

One of my gauges of what I thought about a movie is ""Would I watch it again if I saw it while flipping channels?""  For ""Last Vegas"" that answer is a resounding ""yes.""",1396137600,,1780,4.746753246753247

5307297,4,B009AMAOTQ,"I liked this movie. It's about a group of kids who hung out together. They get older but stay in touch. When the last of them get married the others decide to throw him a bachelor party in Vegas. There they meet Mary Steenburgen (who still looks hot). There is no violence, and no actual sex that I can remember (but it does take place in Vegas...). There's some cross-dressing guys involved (again..Vegas) but nothing to bad if that sort of thing bothers you. I enjoyed it!",1396137600,,474,4.459770114942529
5307298,4,B009AMAOTQ,"You can't go wrong with this cast, including four of my favorite actors in the leading roles and the charismatic Mary Steenburgen in a supporting role. The writing is in a starring role as well. The humor is adult and adolescent at the same time, just what it should be for these characters who are trying to relive the good old days but in modern Las Vegas which adds a whole new dimension to the idea of party times.",1396137600,,418,4.30379746835443
5307299,4,B009AMAOTQ,"Okay, so this is a bit of a cliche script and you really know what is coming, but there are two things to this movie I really like 1) it's a really funny, lighthearted movie my parents can watch. Little vulgarity and the punch lines are timely and age appropriate (ie. for the retired persons!). It made my mother laugh a lot - bursts of laughter like she could relate 2) there are very few movies you can watch these days that don't have really embarrassing scenes in them you don't want to watch with your parents no matter what age you are! Much like 'The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel', this is a lovely, light hearted movie catered to the older generation who still have a fantastic sense of humor and have been largely overlooked in the movie theater. Great movie. Highly recommend.",1396137600,,785,4.496503496503497

They all come together as longtime friends in this buddy road trip to Las Vagas.

Along the way they fight, laugh, party and do all the other things you would expect on a trip to Vegas in a variation of the ""coming of age"" theme, including the club scene and even a swimsuit competition

Number one, Kevin Kline is not as old as they make him look in this show. Michael Douglas who the movie is about, still looks like Liberace. Morgan Freeman - will always be GOD to me. Its a sad look at aging, and how situations make people who really still have life in them, old. Some funny touching scenes and some sad scenes. Mary Steenburger was great and happy and the only one who was not aging badly.

5307580,3,B009AMAOTQ,"Some cinematic efforts are aimed at a general audience, some toward teens and some, well some to the AARP generation, the now AARP generation since the stars in this film under review, Last Vegas, won their acting spurs when we were young and thought they were cool with their new way of interpreting acting. Well they still are cool, Michael, Robert, Morgan, Mary, and Kevin, even if they have lost a step or seven along the way. This is such an age-centered niche film that I defy anybody to tell me that anybody under say forty would appreciate the story-line.

Here is why. Michael Douglas a 70-something life-long bachelor and ladies man decides in the face of mortality to get married to a woman significantly younger than himself. Naturally for the geriatric set this wedding was to take place in Las Vegas, the land of ageless dreams. In order to do things up right for Michael it is decided that he and his old time corner boys from Brooklyn (thats in NYC for the clueless) should meet up for one last go-round in Vegas.

After rounding up the old crew in Vegas all the natural pratfalls of the old and set in their ways dodge the foursome (except for a duel run at Mary by Michael and Robert). The major question though is the propriety of Michael marrying that young thing which is of course resolved against the notion of intergenerational alliances. The stop of the wedding is aided by that age-appropriate Mary and her beguiling of Michael as well as sage advice from Robert. Along the way all the issues of aging-sickness, assisted living, over-protective children, sexual impotence, sexual desire, and mortality are dealt with either comically or more seriously- issues that those who relate to the wisdom of  50 Cent would be either clueless or indifferent about but that the generation of 68 is dealing right now with as this is written.

5307605,3,B009AMAOTQ,"I enjoy all the stars in this film about Las Vegas and there were some pretty good laughs in it. However, the story was a bit depressing as it portrayed senior citizens in a rather poor light, implying that as a group, we are in poor health, have few interests and take entirely too many medications. Of all of them, Michael Douglas looks the worse with his colored hair and fake mannerisms. He would be better off to act his age.",1395273600,,430,4.320987654320987

5307617,4,B009AMAOTQ,"With a cast like this, it's hard to go wrong!  OK ok, it can go wrong with a bad script or
director-but then you'd have to ask would all of them agree to be in the film?

This was not as comedic as I had expected.  It's more like a buddy film for the
ageing baby boomer crowd.  These four guys (played by Michael Douglas,
Robert de Niro, Morgan Freeman and Kevin Kline) were close buddies
growing up, but as adulthood came along they went in different directions.  As
the story begins Michael Douglas's character (long-time bachelor) has decided
to marry a girl young enough to be his daughter, or maybe grand-daughter
(shades of real life, anywhere?) and his friends decide to throw him a bachelor
party in Vegas.  It'll be the first time they've gotten together in many, many years.
Slight plot spoilers: De Niro's character has held a grudge against Douglas's
for some time-plus he's grown increasingly crusty in general with age.
Naturally these 2 have to work out their problems at the party--which takes
basically the whole movie to accomplish.  Throw in Mary Steenbergen as
an older struggling singer on the strip, to which both Douglas and de Niro
are attracted, just to add more complications.

There are a lot of digs at Michael Douglas's character for planning to marry
such a young girl.  There's plenty of alcohol flowing, but generally the movie
is suited to the PG-13 rating with no real nudity (but plenty of highly attractive
young women in bathing suits, and some men similarly attired.  Add 50 Cent,
Cirque du Soleil, Romany Malco, shake well and you have an enjoyable film
that touches on issues like maintaining friendships despite distance and
marriages and old age and illness, while still making you at least smile if
not laugh.  Who knows there could be a sequel.",1395187200,,1788,4.735483870967742
5307618,2,B009AMAOTQ,"When I first heard all of these great actors were going to be a film together, I couldn't wait. Then I saw the trailer and thought the film looked terrible and ended up avoiding it in theaters. I rented it when it came out and while it wasn't as terrible as I feared, it's still pretty bad. I'm a bit shocked all of these actors agreed to be in something with such weak written material. Then again, they all probably got big paychecks and De Niro seems to agree to be in anything these days. The best way to sum this movie up is that it's like a CBS Sitcom. Predictable plot, corny jokes, and forced drama. I might have chuckled 2 or 3 times during the whole movie. And also a PG-13 rated Las Vegas movie just doesn't feel right. I don't normally care about ratings, but this movie really should've been rated R and had some more raunchy material in it. They played it way too safe in my opinion. It's not quite the embarrassment I feared it would be, but it's still not worth watching.",1395187200,,987,4.25531914893617

John Wayne is bad actor. Acting is the ability to not be recognizable in parts. Cruise, Eastwood, Wayne..(add Oprah) uses the same facial expressions to convey messages.

5307746,4,B009AMAOTQ,Putting these four major talents together is certainly worth the view and each one held their own.  The storyline was light hearted with a few serious reflections on the hell that aging reaps on our bodies and lives and reminders when we think we're still the same 'youngster' we used to be.  Definitely recommend renting; not sure I'd want to watch it more than once.,1394841600,,368,4.6461538461538465
5307747,5,B009AMAOTQ,"Being in the same generation as these guys and being a fan of Morgan Freeman and Kevin Kline, I found this movie hilarious from beginning to end. It is very upbeat but has rather simplistic serious messages that is not clobbered over your head and may even be necessary for some older people to confront in their own lives. Movies like this one and the even better QUARTET, make me realize that life is not over at seventy. My son and daughter-in-law loved the movie as well, so it is not just for the old. Thank you to those producers who are making these movies.",1394841600,,564,4.380952380952381

5307784,4,B009AMAOTQ,Highly rated for its great cast and strong performances plus the demonstration that being over 50 ( or 70) doesn't mean you're incapacitated.  Some inconsistencies here though as three of the four protagonists have given up on living and the fourth still thinks he's 30.  But it's a fun movie that shows senior citizens can still have adventures and ultimately fall in love.,1394668800,,374,4.920634920634921

5307830,3,B009AMAOTQ,The movie had a great cast and the mood was fun. I was happy none of the main characters was ill or dying....making it a funny movie with a sad ending.

5307928,2,B009AMAOTQ,"I thought that the first 30 minutes was pretty funny, and had some good jokes. But then they did a horrible job of balancing the comedy with drama. The comedy wasn't funny after that. And the drama was heavy, yet cheesy and painfully predictable! I wanted to turn in off because it was painful to watch towards the end.

5307929,3,B009AMAOTQ,"Last Vegas brings together 3 old friends who take a break from their day-to-day lives to throw a bachelor party in Las Vegas for their last remaining single pal.

Last Vegas brings together the star power of DeNiro, Morgan Freeman, Michael Douglas and Mary Steenburgen, so I had high expectations from the movie just considering the stars alone. And while this is not as outrageous as the Hangover series, this movie does have its moments of laugh albeit very tame laughs versus Hangover for sure.

The movie does get a bit sentimental at times, maybe sometimes overly so. This film does seem to be targeted for the older audience so younger crowds may not appreciate the message of reconciling your past and living life again almost like Bucket List (although I thought that was done much better in Bucket List.)

An ok movie that doesn't quite make it to greatness in either its comedy or sentimentality but is decent nonetheless and ok to watch.",1394323200,,948,4.7682926829268295

5307954,3,B009AMAOTQ,"I always thought I liked Mary Steenburgen, but in this movie she grated on my nerves.  I'm not sure if it was her voice or her lines or her acting, or all three.  Possibly the writing because I found myself more aware of the dialog than I usually am....meaning it didn't flow easily.  The story was ok and I liked the characters.

The biggest problem here was not the movie itself, but the delivery of the video.  OMG, it took us almost FOUR HOURS to watch this movie that was 1:44 long.  It kept stopping and loading every couple of minutes.  Then would go completely out with Error messages.  So frustrating!!!  We would have to start at the home page over and over.  Then sometimes it would start a couple of minutes BACK and we'd have to watch the same part over again or fast forward (which meant waiting AGAIN).  This was our first Amazon Video.  If this is how it's going to be, then I'm going to have to find another service.  I thought Netflix was bad, this was a hundred times worse!  BTW, in between we checked Netflix and it was streaming normally, so it was not our internet's fault.",1394323200,,1096,4.361386138613861

5307975,4,B009AMAOTQ,"The movie was first-rate acting which is what you expect from actors of their stature.  I like that I could not guess what was going to happen next.  There is nothing original about the storyline, but there was a twist at every turn.  It had adult subject matter, and so it is not suitable for children.",1394150400,,303,4.375
5307996,5,B009AMAOTQ,A great cast and a lot more to the storyline than previews hint at. It even had a few James Bond-esque twists to it. A good film about four coming-of-ageless men and one already ageless woman.,1394150400,,192,4.361111111111111

5308003,5,B009AMAOTQ,"The top two, Morgan Freeman and Robert DeNiro give great performances and are supported by a mature Michael Douglas and Kevin Kline.
Watched it with my dad and loved it, plan to own it real soon as it has good old fashion ""guy jokes"" and is a great watch for a father and son.  Perhaps some of the humor is not for everyone but in the end it is just a sweat movie.  Definitely worth renting if not owning.",1394064000,,405,4.113924050632911

5308019,5,B009AMAOTQ,"This is one of those movies that if you don't have years of living and friendship behind you, you will miss so much of what it is about.  We are of the same age of these guys and we understand where they are coming from so it was a fantastic movie to us.

5308021,5,B009AMAOTQ,This movie gets right to the heart of what it means to struggle with the realities of aging.  It is incredibly funny and incredibly true (that said by one who is living it!).  The depiction of the ups and downs of friendship is poignant and uplifting.  It's a true celebration of aging well.  I'm not sure how the under 40's would experience this movie but for anyone over 60 it's a winner.,1394064000,,390,4.375

5308137,5,B009AMAOTQ,We laughed all the way through. So many happenings a senior couple can relate to.  If laughter is the best medicine then these four could give a national drug chain a real run for the money.,1393891200,,190,4.277777777777778

5308145,5,B009AMAOTQ,"What a great group of actors....I think they must have loved making this movie.  It's a bit slow, a little silly and somewhat predictable but a welcome change if you want to escape and end the night in a good mood.  Probably not for the little ones or teens, too old and slow for them....but for us it was just a fun night at the movies.",1393804800,,337,4.090909090909091

The premise is good but one feels that for a comedy, more laughs should be expected and where pratfalls occur, well not really funny and when one has his wife present him with a condum before he leaves for Las Vegas and tells him to have a good time...either she's a complete dunce or an angel minus the wings.
The only one whose character is explored to some extent is played by Michael Douglas and  when he explains his reason for marrying a girl young enough to be his granddaughter he exhibits the best acting in the film.
Anyway, for some mindless pass time it might be OK for some smiles but for a really good comedy, try elsewhere.",1393459200,,736,4.326086956521739

5308334,5,B009AMAOTQ,"With so many movies coming out these days featuring nothing but the youngest of stars it's nice to see a movie come out with major actors getting on in age taking the leading roles. It's even better when that movie is not only well made but one of the funniest things to come out in quite some time.

The Flatbush Four is a group of teens in the 50s who have their own so called gang. The promise of being friends forever takes a turn for the worse but we don't know why, except that years later as one gets married the tale unfolds. Approaching 70, Billy (Michael Douglas) decides to wed the girlfriend half his age. He calls his friends Archie (Morgan Freeman) and Sam (Kevin Kline) and arranges them to meet him in Vegas to celebrate with a bachelor party. He also charges them with contacting and bringing Paddy (Robert DeNiro), his best friend who he hasn't spoken to in over a year.

Each member of the group has their own item to bring to the table. Archie had a stroke the year before and his son won't let him do anything resulting in his having to sneak out. Sam is living in a retirement community with his wife and bored silly so his wife presents him with the gift of a free pass while in Vegas to do whatever and come back the man she once knew. And Paddy has become a recluse, still dealing with the death of his wife, the love of his life and the only female welcomed into the group when they were kids.

The foursome arrives in Vegas and immediately tempers flare in the form of Paddy. It takes a while but eventually we learn that Billy didn't make it to Paddy's wife's funeral, something he won't forgive Billy for missing. While it still bothers him he eventually sets that aside to be part of the bachelor party.

Things get started when the group discovers that the rooms they had booked won't be ready for another year as the hotel is under renovations. While there they hear a woman singing their old songs, Diana (Mary Steenburgen), in the lounge. They're captivated and remember good times. Making friends with Diana, she helps them find their way through Vegas to the hotel where Billy is supposed to be getting married. While waiting for rooms, Archie finds a way to make their weekend in Vegas more memorable (no I won't spoil that for you).

Soon the group is staying in the penthouse and getting involved in all sorts of major over the top events. They judge a bikini contest poolside. They party at the exclusive club on top of the hotel (one of the funniest scenes takes place there and involves Red Bull, vodka and Freeman). During it all Billy begins to wonder if he's making the right decision while at the same time attracted to Diana. The problem is so is Paddy.

But the focus of the film isn't the problems that these two have even though they pop up periodically and are eventually settled before the film ends. The movie is more about the camaraderie between the four men from the time they were boys until now in their waning years. Friendship knows no bounds nor does it recognize age. The love shared between these four characters has served them well all this time and the trip to Vegas rekindles that love before the finish.

Each of the four actors gets a chance to shine here in well worn characters that are familiar to each. DeNiro gets the tough guy, Douglas the charmer, Freeman the smooth mover and Kline the master of the witty retort. There is no way to single one out as the best but that scene with Freeman and the lines he has to deliver rapidly is fun to watch. The thing that makes this movie so good is the combination of acting, laughs and story, something that seems lacking in most movies today. Not only did I find myself invested in the story of these four friends I was also pausing the movie every now and then because I was laughing so hard.

LAST VEGAS is not a movie that you'll want to rent once. It's one to add to your collection. I can already sense a bit of anticipation in myself wanting to watch it again already. Not only that I want to see these four friends reunited for another film. Let's hope that another bachelor party is in the works for the Flatbush Four.",1393372800,,4144,4.39374185136897

Some past hurts show up in their later years and now that they are much older, the bachelor of the 4 originals decides to get married and wants his buddies to share in his first marriage when the rest of them were and/or are married and their marriages were so wonderful and meaningful.  Michael Douglas is the one getting married and wants his ""buddies"" to be there with him in Las Vegas.
Secrets are revealed and yet the childhood bonds are still there and they watch one another's backs like the boys that they once were. The 3 that had/have wonderful marriages realize that Michael is not only getting married but to someone way too young and the others intervene to save him from making a major mistake and a ""lady,"" far more age appropriate wins Michael's heart and keeps him from a major mistake.
It is a fun film and makes one realize what the dynamics are at the age of 69, which just happens to be my age as well. I found myself in so many parts of the film and I am a woman, go figure.
I appreciated all of it and could relate to it because I have a male friend that had those very bonds with his friends and the love that they formed and they were all born and raised in the lower east side of Manhattan.

I bought the Blu Ray without knowing a thing about the movie and only because 1) I use to live in Vegas, and 2) four TOP stars in it.

5308477,4,B009AMAOTQ,The movie starts a little slow but gets  better and has some really funny scenes. If you are over 50 you will enjoy this movie.,1393200000,,127,4.08
5308478,4,B009AMAOTQ,Very funny. Really enjoyed the movie. Wished we would have watched it with a group of our friends. Reminds you to keep living as you age.,1393200000,,137,4.3076923076923075
5308479,3,B009AMAOTQ,So glad to see these actors together!  Movie was good but not the best I've ever seen. I would watch it again,1393200000,,109,3.9545454545454546

5308481,1,B009AMAOTQ,I got a half hour into it and became comatose  This is absolute garbage with  host of good actors in a go nowhere story with zero laughs. The people applauding this must be the people you hear on any sit com laughing in continuality thru all the bad jokes on a laugh track,1393200000,4,272,4.113207547169812
5308482,5,B009AMAOTQ,Easy to identify with several of the characters on several levels puts you 'in the movie' and that is what it is all about!,1393200000,,123,4.166666666666667

5308496,3,B009AMAOTQ,"I like to visit Las Vegas, so I enjoyed reliving my experiences.  These four men have each been in movies where their performances have moved me greatly, but except for a few lines in this movie, they phoned it in.  I think it's worth seeing when you don't feel like thinking and all your friends are busy.",1393113600,,306,4.350877192982456
5308497,3,B009AMAOTQ,"Not bad but predictable, formulaic, and nothing that would make you want to watch it a second time.  Kind of a waste of huge talent but not the worst movie in the world.",1393113600,,169,4.121212121212121
5308498,4,B009AMAOTQ,"This was an enjoyable movie.  You put some big talented actors in a movie like this and it takes it to a higher level.  The only negative was that it seemed to obsess over old age quite a bit.  I can't imagine that people who grow old are that depressed and feel like its over.  I suppose in a world that is governed by the media and hammers home that unless you're twenty-two years old with a hard rocking body, then you're pointless.",1393113600,,435,4.204819277108434
5308499,5,B009AMAOTQ,"My five star rating of this film isn't an indication that this film breaks any new ground.  Though the five principal actors have Oscars they're not deluding themselves that they are making ""Citizen Kane"".  What they do know is how to have fun and let the audience in on their antics.  Movies like this serve a purpose.  They are low think inoffensive entertainment designed to make you smile which is not to be confused with stupid(i.e. Adam Sandler). The plot was serviceable but not wholly original.  If the actors got an extended vacation to Vegas and got paid for it more power to them.  This was me and my wife's Saturday night date movie and it filled the bill.",1393113600,,668,4.571428571428571

5308525,5,B009AMAOTQ,I have now rented this movie 3 times on Amazon and have laughed just as hard each time I watch it.  The instant video quality was great.  Four great actors and a funny depiction of older men having the time of their lives in Vegas.  I highly recommend!,1393027200,,252,4.208333333333333
5308526,3,B009AMAOTQ,"It's like a prequel to the Bucket List. Only it's more of a hangover for old folk. Love the cast but the story is a bit bland. Still, makes for an entertaining if forgettable night in.",1393027200,,184,4.138888888888889

5308531,4,B009AMAOTQ,Not sure how people didn't like this movie. It's got a little bit of everything. It's not academy award winning but it's very entertaining. Well worth the purchase.,1393027200,,164,4.892857142857143

5308555,5,B009AMAOTQ,"Worth the time to watch a group of great actors work together in one film.  It was funny, entertaining and goes to prove that great actors and actresses can get old, but they are as good on the screen now as in the 80's.",1393027200,,220,4.0
5308556,3,B009AMAOTQ,I thought it was kind of funny overall but it's direct to more of an older crowd. Give it 3 stars.,1393027200,,98,3.7142857142857144

It is funny.",1393027200,,150,4.033333333333333
5308558,5,B009AMAOTQ,Sit back and be entertained.  A bunch of older men get together to throw a bachelor party for one of the group of four long time friends.  It won't win any academy awards but it will entertain  you very charmingly.,1393027200,,214,4.3
5308559,4,B009AMAOTQ,Michael Douglas and Robert DeNiro aree great.  It is amazing to me that someone could assemble all this top line talent in one movie.  Definitely worth the watch,1393027200,,161,4.714285714285714
5308560,5,B009AMAOTQ,"This movie was well done.  Every moment is entertaining and not just parts.  I almost did not rent it because I don't really want to see the Vegas fast life.  Well, it was the best movie out of 3 I bought this week-[Gravity being awful].  As far as Last Vegas - the fast life really is not the focus although some of the casino excitement is there.  The plot is real, believable, and well done. The actors are just great and true to their roles.  I think it's the best clean entertainment in 2014 so far with actual plots and meanings.  And yes, the movies offers a lot of laughs.",1393027200,,580,4.218181818181818

5308577,4,B009AMAOTQ,"This was fun movie that would appeal to adults that have some appreciation of these actors.  It was  good story line but each actors role played to a history of past roles.

5308579,3,B009AMAOTQ,This movie was mildly entertaining. Some very funny spots but not a real winner. I would recommend it for a quiet evening at home when there is nothing else to do.,1392940800,,163,4.290322580645161
5308580,5,B009AMAOTQ,this movie was funny. Little to much swearing but what else is new nowdays. Loved Morgan Freeman.deffinatly would recamond to watch.,1392940800,,132,5.333333333333333

The film is to narrow, only people over 55 would understand or get the humor. The film tries to hard to please too many people - and be too many things.

5308636,5,B009AMAOTQ,"How could you not have a great movie with this cast?  Michael Douglas was superb, as always.  He expressed so many feelings that accompany aging, it was real.  Kevin Klein, Morgan Freeman and Robert Dinero played off each other's performance so well that they probably did not need a script.  This movie was hilarious, poignant, and emotionally stirring at the same time.  Perfection in timing, expression and believability that can only be accomplished with seasoned actors.",1392768000,,475,5.197368421052632

I watched it again recently with my husband who loved it as well.  The actors ... all of whom are amazing in their own right ... have tremendous chemistry.  Couple that with a great story and lots of fun, and this movie has it all.  I would be remiss to not mention Mary Steenburgen here ... I loved her character, the way she fit in with the boys .... and she had some of the best lines in the movie.  Parts of this movie will make you laugh, some parts make you think, and others will tug at your heart strings.  All in all, a great movie.",1392681600,,654,3.9846153846153847
5308733,3,B009AMAOTQ,This movie had some humorous parts but overall not a funny movie.  Would recommend for truly mindless entertainment.  Morgan Freeman was the best.,1392681600,,146,5.304347826086956
5308734,4,B009AMAOTQ,I thought it was very funny....especially for the over 60 age group!  Enjoyed it very much.  Recommend it to anyone.,1392681600,,116,4.75
5308735,5,B009AMAOTQ,Great movie!!  Would highly recommend this movie.  Full of laughs and a wonderful story.  Enjoyed it very much  may rent it again!!,1392681600,,131,4.818181818181818

5308739,5,B009AMAOTQ,"I thought it was a funny and well thought out movie. The acting was as it should be with the ensemble of great actors onboard.
the soundtrack was so good we went right back to amazon and got the CD! I especially loved the ""judging contest!"" Definitely worth watching :)",1392681600,,269,4.4
5308740,5,B009AMAOTQ,"I have not laugh so hard during a movie for a long time.  This is not the stupid humor that seems to be the main focus of many movies.  This was just down right, belly laughing fun.",1392681600,,181,3.864864864864865
5308741,4,B009AMAOTQ,I didn't know what to expect but it was really a very cute movie and I liked the ending. Good acting.,1392681600,,101,3.857142857142857
5308742,4,B009AMAOTQ,It was fun but lacked that punch that these top actors normally deliver. I expected more however it didn't disappoint,1392681600,,117,4.9
5308753,3,B009AMAOTQ,This was a fun and light hearted movie. All in all the 4 characters were an entertaining group and they never seem to let you down. Especially a good rental for those of us that can relate!,1392681600,,189,4.135135135135135
5308754,5,B009AMAOTQ,"Inspiring and invigorating, smile. The acting and the writing were articulate and authentic...so said all. These men and woman (Mary Steenburgen)are icons and the film will join the annals of important movie representations of life.",1392681600,,232,5.6571428571428575
5308755,3,B009AMAOTQ,"It was a decent movie.  A bit cheesy at times.  I thought Morgan Freeman was very funny.
 Kevin Kline was a goof as usual.",1392681600,,122,4.0
5308756,4,B009AMAOTQ,"With these five mega stars (including Mary S), it HAD to be a good movie!  Comedy was great, happy ending (Has to be one for me to enjoy), and light hearted movie for those nights when you need a lift in spirit.  Really enjoyed this one - worth the rental for sure!
One note - lots of language, bikini clad women, and sexual content.  No sex or nudity was shown though.",1392681600,,369,4.169014084507042
5308757,5,B009AMAOTQ,Awesome so funny and heartwarming. There's some cussing but nothing to stop you from watching with he kids. These actors just get better and better,1392681600,,147,4.92
5308758,2,B009AMAOTQ,"This was an OK movie, but it was not completely engaging.  It was slow.  I had to play solitaire on my phone in order to continue watching it.",1392595200,,142,4.035714285714286
5308759,3,B009AMAOTQ,The actors were mechanical and the story was boring I was not to impressed with the movie.  I liked seeing the actors ages that was about all I was paying attention too.,1392595200,,169,4.28125
5308760,4,B009AMAOTQ,I watched this movie with My mom on our trip to Florida to see our new Grandbaby...I Think this is a movie that spans human emotion in all stages..plus these guys are still just the hot guys we married Right....Fun and just makes us GOOD,1392595200,,237,4.288888888888889
5308761,5,B009AMAOTQ,It was nice to sit and watch a movie that wasn't filled with foul language and guns and drugs. I'm no prude but sometimes it's just nice to sit and laugh and enjoy the story,1392595200,,173,3.9714285714285715
5308762,5,B009AMAOTQ,"Good story line, funny, touching, and very few curse words.  Hard to find a movie now that doesn't have nudity and vulgarities. This one is worth watching.",1392595200,,155,4.7407407407407405

5308774,5,B009AMAOTQ,"Loved it.  Laughed the whole way through the movie. With the exception of one risque scene, I was very comfortable watching with my family.  We even watched a second time the following day with my parents.  At 80, they could completely relate to the the lives of these men.  In fact, after breakfast, my mom broke out their pill box and layed out their pills to take before watching the movie!",1392595200,,393,4.492957746478873
5308775,5,B009AMAOTQ,I wanted to see this because of the 4 big name stars involved.  Was very good.  Surprised it didn't do better in the theaters.  Would definitely recommend it.  The one liners were great!!,1392595200,,187,4.575757575757576
5308776,2,B009AMAOTQ,"I expected more from the movie with the four popular actors..but the plot was predictable, the laughs were lame, and the script could have been so much better.  I felt it was almost a waste on these talents. There were good moments, though-the times when the men were boys, etc.
I'm sure my 77 yr. old parents would love this movie, just wasn't for me.",1392595200,,352,4.415384615384616
5308777,4,B009AMAOTQ,"It's a bit fluffy and the premise seems a bit forced, but the chemistry between the actors is great and some of the lines in the script are excellent. I recommend it if you're a fan of these actors in particular and like romantic comedies.",1392595200,,239,4.333333333333333

5308782,5,B009AMAOTQ,It's was GREAT! Totally funny from the start to finish. Love all the actors and how good they still are.,1392595200,,104,4.25
5308803,5,B009AMAOTQ,"Great cast- hysterical story line! We really enjoyed the comedy with the four main actors- DeNiro, Freeman,Douglas, and Kline. Often times, these actors play more serious roles. It was nice to see them in a lighthearted comedy.",1392595200,,227,5.162162162162162
5308804,3,B009AMAOTQ,Its funny...always great to see these actors together....its good movie for a Sunday afternoon...but far from award winning for any of these actors.  Its predictable and doesn't have much depth.....,1392595200,,198,5.6
5308805,4,B009AMAOTQ,Very different from what thought. Much more interesting. Liked the unsuspected ending! I especially liked the twenty one game Morgan played and the outcome!,1392595200,,156,5.541666666666667
5308806,5,B009AMAOTQ,Wife and I enjoyed the movie and it provided some good laughs. I would definitely recommend it with a few snacks and a bowl of popcorn.,1392595200,,135,4.230769230769231
5308807,2,B009AMAOTQ,The movie was a disappointment! with such good actors I expected more! Don't get this movie. don't get this movie,1392595200,,113,4.7
5308808,2,B009AMAOTQ,Older person jokes were not really funny. The actors are 70 not 90. I like all the actors just not the movie.,1392595200,,109,4.0
5308809,3,B009AMAOTQ,It was similar to other Vegas movies in which a group of guys go to Vegas to party.  The exception to this one was that it was older guys who went.  It is meant for a older audience which I am so there were parts in it that I thought were funny & entertaining.,1392595200,,260,3.7962962962962963
5308810,5,B009AMAOTQ,"This is going to be a classic ""go to"" movie that we will watch again and again. The cast of stars is unbeatable. We found ourselves laughing out loud through the whole movie.",1392595200,,174,4.303030303030303
5308811,5,B009AMAOTQ,"My husband and I both loved this movie. It had a wonderful story line, included love on several levels, the acting was great, it was funny and heartwarming,the language was tame and the overall feel was uplifting. Highly recommend.",1392595200,,231,4.948717948717949
5308812,2,B009AMAOTQ,"Rated at this level due to slow pace ,story line very predictable and weak. With an all star cast this movie certainly was just an attempt to get one out there. The acting capable of these stars certainly was below their abilities and detrimental to what they are or were capable of.",1392595200,,283,4.461538461538462
5308823,5,B009AMAOTQ,"This movie is refreshingly retro in some ways, but uses modern movie-making techniques to make it enjoyable to watch. The experience of the actors is evident. The story line has the right mixture of drama and comedy. I recommend this movie to everyone who is, or knows, a grandpa or grandma, or an ""older"" aunt or uncle.",1392595200,,320,4.631578947368421
5308824,2,B009AMAOTQ,"Well, four old actors and Mary Steenburgen got a nice payday, at least.  That's really  what this movie was all about in the end.  Maybe thats all we should expect with the story line but the acting they offered was not no good.  Especially Kevin Kline.  Of course Michael Douglas gets to be the center of the universe, how ridiculous.  Glad I didn't pay theatre price and frankly wished I had waited for RedBox to offer it.",1392595200,,424,4.441558441558442

5308826,3,B009AMAOTQ,"Given the cast ensemble for this movie I had high expectations. Yet while I did chuckle at a few one liners, the film was held back by the fairly predictable Hollywood formula plot.",1392595200,,181,4.515151515151516
5308827,5,B009AMAOTQ,Great actors without any doubt at all and was fun to watch. Would recommend to others to watch and enjoy.,1392595200,,105,4.3
5308828,3,B009AMAOTQ,I enjoyed it. The movie was a good comedy and I liked that Las Vegas was the background as I was there.,1392595200,,103,3.727272727272727
5308829,3,B009AMAOTQ,"Lots of stars, but starts slow and got better as movie progressed. I would suggest a good movie for a slow afternoon.",1392595200,,117,4.363636363636363
5308830,4,B009AMAOTQ,I really enjoyed this film. Not the funniest movie I have ever watched but I love the actors and it was a wonderful portrayal of senior issues.,1392595200,,143,4.333333333333333
5308831,3,B009AMAOTQ,This was an entertaining movie but there were not surprises - the kind of thing you enjoy for while watching and then immediately forget.,1392595200,,137,4.75

5308834,4,B009AMAOTQ,"It was a great rental. Lots of laughs, typical humor, but not completely predictable,,, well almost. They all played their parts well and we enjoyed it for exactly what it was. Definitely older humor for older folks.",1392595200,,216,4.864864864864865
5308835,3,B009AMAOTQ,Fun and entertaining. Better than most but not awesome. It is worth the time and money watching the great field of actors.,1392595200,,122,4.590909090909091
5308836,4,B009AMAOTQ,Totally enjoyable; forget reality and just sit back and enjoy this one. The acting is superb . Las Vegas is portrayed in its glitziest kitchyist form.,1392595200,,150,4.8076923076923075
5308837,3,B009AMAOTQ,"Not a bad movie, worth a look and funny, but with a cast like this I would expect a little bit better script and more depth in the story.  I'm glad I watched it.",1392595200,,161,3.735294117647059
5308838,3,B009AMAOTQ,"It's a joy to see these great actors together; however, the narrative is predictable. Still enjoyed it, nonetheless. Fun movie fare for a Friday night.",1392595200,,151,5.08
5308839,5,B009AMAOTQ,This movie hit the spot for us. Enjoyed the characters and storyline. Just fun and light hearted with Vegas as the back drop.,1392595200,,125,4.478260869565218
5308840,4,B009AMAOTQ,"The Michael Douglas character here is going to marry a girl half his age. His friends Robert DeNiro, Kevin Kline and Morgan Freeman offer up a bachelor party in Vegas. When Freeman's character hits it big at the blackjack table the hotel offers up the best suite, a perfect place for the party. Mary Steenburgen appears as a wanna be lounge singer with an interesting part. Robert DeNiros wife has passed recently and he doesn't want to go anywhere but he gets dragged to Vegas anyway. I found this a fun story with enough love and laughs to keep me smiling, and that's what I am looking for in this type of movie. So I can recommend it, especially if you like these actors.",1392508800,,674,4.443548387096774
5308841,5,B009AMAOTQ,"Very funny movie with four 'senior' gents enjoying renewal friendship in Vegas, I really enjoyed Morgan's face and actions at the poker table.",1392508800,,142,5.217391304347826

5308865,3,B009AMAOTQ,"I was surprised that this movie actually had a pretty good plot in spite of attempting to be another ""hangover"" type of Vegas adventure for old men.",1392508800,,148,4.518518518518518
5308866,5,B009AMAOTQ,"These fellows can act.  Relaxing comedy, and true it is formula movie but the acting makes it.  Well worth watching.",1392508800,,116,4.75

5308870,4,B009AMAOTQ,This movie has some good laughs.  It was enoyable to watch these four characters interact with each other.  Very entertaining.,1392422400,,126,5.25
5308871,5,B009AMAOTQ,"This was a movie about four lifelong school buddies. One of them has never married,and when he calls his other buddies to tell them he is getting married, they decide to give him a bachelor party in Las Vegas. The comedy part is that they are in their 60's. Most of the funny lines are based on the ""old"" factor. We are older, so the movie appealed to us. There were a couple of touching parts to the movie having to do with long ago issues. One or two ""grody"" scenes, but of course it's vegas. This might not be funny and might be predictible to a younger viewer.",1392422400,,564,4.18348623853211

5308887,5,B009AMAOTQ,The three male stars of this caliber made this movie a joy to watch. I think those of us that are a bit close that age bracket can relate and see ourselves in any one of these characters.,1392422400,,187,3.9473684210526314

5308908,5,B009AMAOTQ,Hadn't seen this movie yet. However the reason I bought it was from the previews on another movie I was watching. Looks like its going to be a very funny movie and make you laught,1392422400,,179,4.142857142857143
5308909,1,B009AMAOTQ,"Would have maybe enjoyed it more, but this is the second straight movie I habve been challenged in getting it to stream. Couldn't finish the movie and yet I am still billed. I find that Netflix movie stream and my own satellite choice for pay for view are a much better choice.",1392422400,2,277,4.346153846153846

5308911,1,B009AMAOTQ,"I guess I'm not the target audience, I'm only 38 and I have a brain.
My wife and I watched the movie until the end (somehow) and we only laughed, while we were making fun of the HORRIBLE acting and script. It seemed as if a 15 year old virgin, wrote the screenplay based on what he imagined it would be like, to be in his late 60ies and going to Vegas. Most of the actors looked like they were ashamed to be in this movie and they should be. This was nothing more then a money grab based on names, I bet it took them less then 3 weeks to shoot and edit.

I want my $6 back, not because I need it, but because those associated with this movie, do not deserve it.

The positive reviews, must be paid reviews from the studio, I can't imagine anyone with an IQ over 65 finding this even remotely interesting. PAINFUL! BAD!!!

(P.S. The amount of silicon and botulinum toxin in every female (and some of the men) in the movie, is nothing less then disturbing, most of them look like the 'Joker')",1392336000,11,990,4.145833333333333

5308924,3,B009AMAOTQ,"I should not be so torn between giving this movie a good or bad review. Strange I know. I think it was cast well, but to me Michael Douglas ruined the movie. I normally like him but in this movie it seemed like he was not even really trying to act like the other members. I loved Di Nero, Kline, Freeman, and Steenburgen. The previous mentioned actors and actress really made the movie for me. Great story line in general. Kind of actually wish the ending was different though. I am glad I did not purchase this movie like I was originally going to.",1392336000,,549,4.288461538461538
5308925,4,B009AMAOTQ,This was a fantastic movie about some aging men who want to have one more go round. It was like the Rat Pack hit 70. Loved every minute of it although Kevin Kline stole the movie telling everyone his wife gave him a free pass and a condom. Very funny with a great ending.,1392336000,,271,4.037037037037037

5308951,5,B009AMAOTQ,"One of the funniest movies we've seen in a long time. We will watch it again.  We're in our 50's so we can relate to this movie. All of the actors were top performers and each of the characters had their own health issues to contend with, but they were determined to have a good time and that's what they did. Just because we're old doesn't mean we can't have fun! Enjoy!",1392249600,,371,4.152777777777778

5308967,3,B009AMAOTQ,Fun and funny but average. I love the actors but the movie is beneath them. Rent it don't buy it,1392163200,,96,3.85
5308968,3,B009AMAOTQ,It makes its rating because of the big stars in the movie.  The combo of little stars with big stars is a let down.  Why have A list actors and B list actresses?  THAT was a let down.,1392163200,,183,3.763157894736842

5308971,4,B009AMAOTQ,I liked this movie it took awhile to get to see it on my computer. But thanks to Amazon they helped me. Morgan Freeman is one actor that started out late. But he's one of the Best.,1392163200,,180,3.891891891891892

5308985,4,B009AMAOTQ,"I was expecting hysterical after reading reviews comparing it to The Hangover. No way!! It is funny and does have a somewhat decent storyline. Just not laugh out loud funny. Don't let this stop you from seeing it, the actors are really good. Just don't expect The Hangover funny.",1392163200,,279,4.714285714285714
5308986,5,B009AMAOTQ,Okay the story line might be an old one but it has a fresh treatment with an all star cast.  Lots of belly laughs and touching scenes about friendship and the aging process.  Script is tight and acting is all good.  Solid entertaining film.,1392163200,,240,4.409090909090909
5308987,4,B009AMAOTQ,"Decent movie... definitely worth renting if you're in the mood for a comedy with some great actors. The characters are great, although the plot is a little cookie-cutter.

5309005,5,B009AMAOTQ,"Great cast, good acting and a superb setting! What more could you want?

Well, a better story would have been nice!

This movie/story reminds me of those Grade C films that you just know are summer fillers for great actors to make a little coin while not really stretching their acting chops much.

But, in the end, isn't that why one goes to a movie - to be transported into a fantasy world for a couple of hours of calm in the dark?",1392163200,,434,4.204819277108434
5309006,4,B009AMAOTQ,It was a great movie - lot of laughs but also has a good story line. Great actors - I cannot believe it did not do better at the movie theaters.  Probably because it does not have any killing in it!,1392163200,,198,3.8292682926829267

5309035,5,B009AMAOTQ,"Last Vegas is a fun to watch entertaining film that can hold your attention and keep it for the duration. The script is good and the cast of highly qualified veteran thespians can still dish the lines. I love watching stories about Las Vegas and if you feel the same, you won't be disappointed by Last Vegas either. It is a film full of sentiment and earnest emotions that's timed to perfection with laugh out loud hysterics from a bunch of old guys. I especially enjoyed the big party scene at the Mirage Hotel. Kudos to Michael Douglas who looked awesome, Robert De Niro who played the perfect pessimist, Kevin Klein and of course our Shawshank Redemption'ist Mr. Morgan Freeman who all brought it to the screen. A big KUDOS to the entire cast and crew...deserving five stars from me and a big raise from Hollywood. 02.11.2014 SKC.",1392076800,,833,4.635135135135135

5309111,2,B009AMAOTQ,"You would think that big names like Robert DeNiro, Michael Douglas, Morgan Freeman, Kevin Kline and Mary Seienburgen could make a smoking hot flick, you'd be wrong. Maybe it the fact that there is too much star power in this film that makes every ones acting seem sub par. It's hard to swallow that that the Flatbush Four, the guys, could or would pull off a Vegas road trip and bachelor party in their 60's. They're bad ass kids doing sassy Flatbush things one minute, them they are beat up old dudes going for that one last kisk ass party in the kick ass party town, Las Vegas. Kevin Kline's wife even gives him a Viagra and a condom and tells him ""What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas"" as he's leaving for the airport. De Niro is a flat bound old dude that is not over losing his wife of many years. Freeman is an old dude who's being reversed parented by his son and Douglas is an almost believable Malibu big shot who proposes at his mentor's funeral. They get to Vegas and into the penthouse bungalow at the Aria and then jump in to the Vegas scene with a bunch of 20-30 somethings. You can guess where it goes from there. I often wonder why excellent thespians make really bad movies from time to time, I'm pretty sure its for the money. This cast has done some of the best work on film yet they willing ride this movie into the ground. I'm actually embarrassed for most of them. The vies of Las Vegas night life is interesting and it's interesting in a morbid way to watch great actor make a bad movie.",1391990400,,1511,4.286713286713287

A lot of laughs and a few teary moments.  I would recommend this movie, it is a good one that you can watch every now and then.  We love Vegas and go often, which made it that much more special.  Also, a very clean movie, not much cursing and no nudity, that is a plus in a movie.  Glad we got it for our collection.",1391990400,,463,3.8617021276595747

I mean, buddies in love with the same girl, lifelong friendships, the young girl inexplicably wanting to sleep with the old guy.. all timeworn fodder. But still these actors are of a high enough caliber to make it better than the actual plot. Except Kevin Kline - just kidding, he's good too. It's easy to watch, a few genuine laughs. Curiously, the main thing I got from it was, ""Michael Douglas is still a really good actor!"" At about 1:30 in he has a poignant scene and I was actually surprised, remembering how I used to like his movies. I might go rent some of his old ones after that. I'd call this three stars with an extra thrown in for the A-list cast.",1391990400,2,720,4.380597014925373

5309177,3,B009AMAOTQ,"The best I can say about this movie is that it is cute.  Not hilarious.  It has some funny moments.  In between slow moments.  The jokes are not edgy or new.  Just amusing moments about being old in a world full of young people, in a city infested with them.

The acting is perfect.  But the story content is dull.  There are a few laughs, but this movie is not for everyone.  A few forced morals shoulder their way through the plot.  A mildly touching twist between two of the friends.  Nothing exciting.

Funny thing is I do not look at these guys and ponder how ""old"" they are.  I just love them as actors.  So a movie that constantly bangs over my head how old they are gets annoying.  Just give them a well-written plot and some sophisticated dialogue, PLEASE!  Not in this movie.

Not worth buying.  Renting?  Maybe.",1391904000,,822,4.36

5309197,5,B009AMAOTQ,I hadn't even heard of this movie when it was in the theaters...but it's definitely a sleeper.  The casting is perfect and unexpected.  The comedic timing is spot on and makes it worth watching repeatedly.  The storyline is not as predicable as many are.  Each of the characters is fleshed out well and someone that you come to care for.  Just goes to show that it doesn't matter how old you are...acting is a talent that defies age.,1391817600,,433,4.5

5309230,3,B009AMAOTQ,"Last Vegas (2013) is a decent comedy that has a very predictable plot, and some good self-deprecating humor. When watching this movie, I had the feeling that the actors were trying too hard to be funny, as if the movie would be doomed without a lot of laughs. In some ways, they were right, as the humor makes up for the thin plot. I found myself laughing a lot during this movie, as well as touched in certain serious scenes. Morgan Freeman probably gives the best performance of all the actors. Overall, this is decent comedy, and ideal for a change of pace.",1391731200,4,560,4.446601941747573

Same old themes of parties, booze and much younger females. The dialogue was cliche driven as was the contrived acting e.g. one so called buddy pushing another into the pool (also a tiresomely old prank prop) and the fall into the water seemed about as artificial and fake as an ""accidental"" fall can be, set the tone for the rest of the movie.

5309349,4,B009AMAOTQ,"Rented Movie originally reviewed on my blog from which this is adapted.

Any time Hollywood wants to show characters letting loose, and freedom from social convention they end up in Las Vegas, because   well you know why  What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. While I doubt it is true the very make up of the popular mythological Las Vegas makes it the immoral pleasure planet or Sodom and Gomorrah.

This movies pleasure seekers are a group of four friends nearing 70. They were the Flatbush Four in the 1950s, and were apparently loyal pals but very different. Douglas character is getting married and they all decide to head to Las Vegas for a bachelor party weekend.

It feels like  someone got the idea of making THE HANGOVER with older actors in order to capitalize on that movie franchise.  Its not a direct parallel, but more like another buddy film set in Las Vegas.

There isn't a lot of challenge to the acting. The scenes are all short with lots of site gags and montages, including makeovers where the guys shake off the fuddyduddies and get cool.  But the short scenes also make for a choppy feeling even with all the laughs. It also makes the film move quickly and it is funny enough to offset boredom.

And there are a lot of good laughs.  It feels a little bit like a Neil Simon movie; by which reference I automatically date myself and anyone who gets it. I kept expecting  Alan Alda to pop up in a cameo.

In the end, the film is a romance and a  buddy picture, so it is a good choice for both genders and maybe even as a date night movie.  And theres nothing so racy you couldn't watch it with friends or even parents.  Parents should note theres a lot of innuendo. I am glad I waited for it to come  out on video and PPV though, it doesnt need the big screen.  It merits a recommend  high recommend rating especially for people in my age demographic (mumble, mumble to mumble, mumble, mumble).",1391558400,,1915,4.417142857142857

5309370,5,B009AMAOTQ,I was laughing as soon as the movie began. I probably don't have to tell you how great the cast is and they were great together! I plan to buy this one!,1391472000,,152,3.78125
5309371,5,B009AMAOTQ,This is a great movie for laughs.  You will laugh out loud.  All the actors did a good job and it had an interesting story.,1391472000,,123,3.88

5309373,5,B009AMAOTQ,"As expected, this was an awesome movie. Needless to say when you put these 4 guys together it couldn't be anything less. We were not disappointed at all. This should be a must see on your list.

5309374,2,B009AMAOTQ,"Pre ordered this and, as always, Amazon delivered on-time.

I found this to be very predictable. I watched the first 20 minutes and found myself wondering ""when is this movie going to get entertaining""?

With a cast such as this it should have been great.

It isn't.",1391472000,,266,4.617021276595745
5309375,4,B009AMAOTQ,Pretty funny...Puts aging into perspective! Morgan Freeman delivers as always and Kevin Cline is awesome. Not a bad move at all.,1391472000,,128,5.142857142857143
5309376,1,B009AMAOTQ,"Hangover 3 with old people, Id say the original Hangover, but I enjoyed THAT movie.  This was so cliche and the ending so obvious.  And Michael Douglas and his leather skin so painful to look at-was he wearing frosty pink lipstick in this movie or did his throat STD reach his lips?  Ugh, I never want to see another old man pretends to be hip with younger woman movie again.  This was just sad and stupid.

SPOILERS AHEAD
I cringed when Michael Douglas asked his trophy girlfriend to marry him at his friend's funeral, CRINGED, NOT FUNNY AT ALL.  And I cringed again when Kevin Kline's wife gave him a viagra and a condom-seriously?  But what really made me want to turn this movie off was every cliched old man trying to be in with the young folk cliche, the bathingsuit contest, the scene at the club.  It's obnoxious when a movie has 20 somethings oggling women and treating them like objects, even worse when it is men who at their age should know better.  The ending was so obvious I could have written it.  Except in my story, no one would have ended up with leatherface Douglas, Robert De Niro would have gotten the girl.  But really, watching this, I just wished all four of them would have ended up in a home somewhere, locked away and kept from making another awful movie.",1391472000,11,1283,4.44017094017094
5309377,5,B009AMAOTQ,Funny. Great for the over 40 crowd. We can relate. Funnier than any Adam Sandler movie I ever saw. Worth a watch.,1391472000,,113,4.181818181818182

5309380,4,B009AMAOTQ,"This movie was better than I thought it was going to be.  It's funny, yet it deals with real issues such as aging, losing loved ones, and maintaining life-long friendships.  The ensemble is great; each plays his part well without having one character over-shadow the rest of them.  Fun way to pass some time.",1391385600,,308,4.666666666666667

5309382,4,B009AMAOTQ,"My husband and I thought it was great! An enjoyable movie with a great cast. We could only assume that some of the people who gave it poor ratings were expecting more out of it, then what is obviously is, a funny, light hearted comedy with some great old guys!",1391385600,,260,4.22
5309383,5,B009AMAOTQ,This was such a fun and funny romp.  Just enjoyable and entertaining.  Everyone in the family will love it. There is adult material not suitable for under 13.,1391385600,,158,4.607142857142857
5309384,5,B009AMAOTQ,Enjoyed it thoroughly. It was a little sad that I could relate though. Our family enjoyed and laughed throughout. Fun.,1391385600,,118,4.95

5309389,5,B009AMAOTQ,Genuinely funny with a moral/ethical message. The mix of award-winning actors took a mediocre script & gave truly excellent performances.,1391385600,,137,5.9
5309390,5,B009AMAOTQ,Enjoyed a much needed laugh. Reminds me of my group of buddies when we gat together to make more memories.,1391385600,,106,4.35
5309391,4,B009AMAOTQ,"I was surprised how funny this movie was as it was panned by the critics.  I was laughing very hard at times and thought it was well played by all the stars.  De Niro was good as a lost soul, but Freeman, Kline, Steenburgen, and Douglas had the best parts. Some of the back story was not needed.  Freeman character's son was not scripted well and might have been better with less ""the child becomes the parent"" whining.  Same for Douglas's bride to be - not all 32-year-olds are shallow and lite. Las Vegas never looked better and showing the difference between the old and new parts of the Strip seemed to match the themes in the movie very well.",1391385600,,647,4.366666666666666
5309392,4,B009AMAOTQ,I was worried that the best laughs were in the trailer but that was not the case. There are plenty more in the rest of the movie. There were a lot of laughs and not stupid humor either. The top four stars clearly are masters of acting and enjoyed each other's company.,1391385600,,268,4.173076923076923

5309396,1,B009AMAOTQ,"Since I cannot cast this movie through my Chromecast; I may have well spent the money and sat comfortably in the theater.

5309397,4,B009AMAOTQ,"When four actors of the quality of Michael Douglas, Morgan Freeman, Robert DeNiro and Kevin Kline are together on the same screen, how can it be all bad?  Last Vegas is fun, with lots of quips and schtick.  The plot of an old man deciding not to marry his 30-something girlfriend is weak.  Overall, the movie has enough to take to take the time to see it,",1391385600,,355,4.268656716417911

Quite a few laughs, but like any cheesy show, you kind of guess the end at about 1/4 of the movie.  There is other part of it that you do not guess but does explain a lot.

I loved Space Cowboys and Wild Hogs and have watched both numerous times. Last Vegas comes close to matching them in terms of humor, but has a delightful twist that neither of them has. I'll not spoil it here.

What I also will add is that Last Vegas, unlike Wild Hogs and unlike Space Cowboys, left me missing the good old days of Lynwood High with Mike Bennett and Ronnie Weaver, best friends who seem to have disappeared from the face of the planet.

So, while Last Vegas may not be as fun a ride as Wild Hogs or Space Cowboys for hilarity, it may be a more fulfilling, emotional, journey to your youth.

Was predictable from the start. I can't say much about the ending

disappointing. Why these talented guys would sign on for such a

Even though the writing is on the wall, we get to party hardy with the gang as the story plays out.

This is a good example of when everything goes well. The actors all winners do not outperform the characters. There is drama, pathos, and comic relief. We have fancy digs and tasty women. Speaking about women no one told me that Mary Steenburgen in the persona of a singer named Diana was the linchpin that holds the focus of the story.",1391212800,,731,4.2898550724637685

5309479,3,B009AMAOTQ,"Resting on the format of a fifties or sixties comedy, giving glitz, glam, and wonder with little focus on the many of the direct issues the characters face.  Definitely a barrel of laughs, the adds didn't away all the best parts; but the total party atmosphere gets a bit stale.  Not for lack of acting chops, but like all party's you want to leave about fifteen minutes before you actually do, waiting to see if something happens.  If your looking for just a good laugh, this is a film for it; but not much lies beneath the surface.

I'm biased to old folks in film.  Bucket List, Grumpy/Grumpier old men.  This fits neatly into that genre without making any serious deviations from it.  Devoid of the tragedy of most of the genre removes the tear jerker aspect from it, although fitting neatly into the classic Hollywood format of a fifties or sixties comedy, paying homage to the era that the boys were still boys.

Of the notable star ensemble, Kevin Klein gives the stand out performance.  Although the development of the character is a little rough, it doesn't take away from defining a character beyond just the star power brought by the actor.  Further, the awkward behavior stands out like a gem set between the funny but cool styles of Freeman, De Nero, and Douglas.

A classic that should be watched with an older viewer.  Not as touching as some of it's compatriot films, but still manages to raise a smile or two.",1391212800,,1426,4.592885375494071

5309520,1,B009AMAOTQ,"Loved the movie, but here's why I'm only giving it one star. You know how you are forced to endure the anti-piracy ads and ""these are not the views of..."" disclaimers. You know how you get that circle with the line through it in the top right corner when you try to skip or fast forward. Well this movie makes you watch all of the promos for other movies before it will let you see the main feature.

I though I was in an alternate universe or had a defective DVD. After skipping the promos, which I had already seen on other DVDs, I tried to play the main movie. Pressing ""Play"" brought me back to the first promo. I tried to choose a scene, but the same thing happened - back to the beginning of the promos. Each time I tried to start the movie without sitting through all of the promos, I got the circle with the line through it and got bumped back to the first promo.

I said ""screw it"" and watched another movie, but before packing up, I tested a theory. I sat through all of the promos until it came to the menu for Last Vegas. This time pressing ""Play"" had the desired result.

I thoroughly enjoyed the movie but detested the fact that I was made to watch all of the promos before I was ""allowed"" to watch the main feature. Who the hell do these people think they are, taking away my choice!

I will be complaining to my video rental store to indicate that if this becomes common practice, there will be no more video rentals. In fact, rather than be dictated to by the DVD makers, I will sell my home theatre and donate my video collection to the library.

I love Morgan Freeman, Robert DeNiro, Kevin Klein, and Michael Douglas individually in their craft.  The mixture of these masters worked for me.

Billy (Douglas) has finally decided to settle down and get married. He calls up his three oldest friends to tell them and they insist on throwing him a bachelor party. When Paddy (De Niro) sees Billy again old problems come up, and once again a woman comes between them. I have to admit that even with this cast I was not excited about this one. Like many others I was expecting another Hangover type movie but with older people. The reason I try not to watch trailers is because they either give too much away or misrepresent the movie. This one is the later. They played it up like a Hangover movie but watching it this turned out to be so much more. While there was the obvious drinking and sex aspect this one did have a grown up plot and the fact that these four actors were in it really brought the level up from juvenile to real movie. Nothing against the Hangover movies because I liked the first and third one and if I were to compare this to another movie it would be those but this one did have a more grown-up feel. Overall, I liked it more then I thought I would and do recommend this. I give this a B.",1390521600,9,1248,4.2478991596638656
5309524,5,B009AMAOTQ,I liked it. It was a good funny movie. I saw at the theater unlike most of the negative critics on here that watch a trailer and seem to think they know a lot. You will like it if you like good acting. If you like bad actors like Robert Downey or Ben Stiller you will not like it.,1390348800,,280,3.76271186440678

5309527,4,B009AMAOTQ,"""Last Vegas"" (2013 release; 95 min.) brings the story of 4 guys in their late sixties (played by Robert De Niro, Morgan Freeman, Michael Douglas and Kevin Kline) going to Las Vegas for a weekend in preparation of the wedding of the Michael Douglas character to a woman less than half his age. As the movie opens, the characters are shown as young kids growing up in Brooklyn, with also a young girl whom one of them would eventually marry. The movie then goes ""58 Years Later"", and we get introduced to each of the 4 guys, all of them dealing with a predicament of sorts. Not that it matters a lot, as it isn't long before the action shifts to Vegas where they are determined to have a grand time. They also get to know an older female jazz singer (played by Mary Steenbergen). To tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: I admit that I probably wouldn't have caught this movie but for the fact that I just got back from a vacation in Vegas myself and I happen to notice the movie was still playing (in the dollar theatre). I was curious what Vegas would look like in this movie, and I was not disappointed. In fact, once in a  while the location of a movie is as big a character of the movie than any of the performers, and that is certainly the case in this movie. The second big surprise for me was the performance from Mary Steenbergen (you may recall she won an Oscar more than 30 years ago for ""Melvin and Howard""). I hadn't seem her in a movie in forever, even though I know she continues to work fairly frequently in movies. This role again showcases the talents of Ms. Steenbergen. Last but certainly not least, this is of course mostly a comedy but beware, there are some poignant moments towards the end, with some great observations about getting older and how fast the years fly by.

Bottom line: I had little expectations going in, but found myself amused most of the time, and couldn't stop marveling about the Vegas locations in the movie. If you've gone to Vegas, ""Last Vegas"" is a no-brainer and I would recommend it without hesitation. Eve if you haven't gone to Vegas, it's still worth checking out, be it in the theatre or on DVD/Blu-ray.",1388448000,38,2249,4.414457831325302
5309528,4,B009AMAOTQ,"""The last film I've seen in 2013. If you are tired of the whole Hangover shtick that has been throbbing your cinema screens for 4 years, wait till you give a chance and look no further than a better-written, much funnier, less mean-spirited, and somewhat more human take on four guys and life in Vegas with this film, Last Vegas (a pun of its own). Despite its joy and thankfully, the film does not promote gambling, alcohol consumption, or excess.

Freeman, Douglas, DeNiro, Kline, and a witty performance from Steenburgen all provide great and humorous performances as cantankerous old men reconciling after Douglas' character (Billy, from California) tries to invite them all to Vegas in light of his upcoming wedding. The film soon boils down to a story about trust, loyalty, and how friends can make irrational decisions for the sake of proving something but the film never deters to a level where the drama overemphasises the script and the comedy reigns high (which is what The Hangover Part III did not manage to do very well with its bizarre mix of dark comedy, crime thriller, and sex farce).

While the film may seem Hollywoodised and sentimental at parts, I did not get this reaction but it felt the tone, treatment, and the whole film was done just right. All of the gang (especially the normally dry and intelligent Freeman) bring their relaxed chemistry into the film and provide some hilarious scenes involving a VIP entry, dealing with some young egotistical show-off, Freeman walking out of his house, and getting drunk off martinis.

It is not a perfect film but it certainly is a nice treat for older audiences to reconcile their past and feel like living again in a similar way that The Bucket List achieved this feat. Unlike another film that deals with reconciliation and pastime memories/behaviour like The World's End (1990s instead of the 1950s), this is not a fantasy or an outlandish scenario piece and nor does it have the kind of aggressive raunch (but this film does have quite a few sexual references itself too) or violence found in The Hangover too making it more appropriate for the 50+ crowd.""",1388448000,37,2129,4.8273972602739725
5309529,5,B009AMAOTQ,"The movie starts off with four young kids who called themselves the Flatbush Four (the young Robert De Niro, Michael Douglas, Morgan Freeman, & Kevin Kline).  The movie plot surrounds the fact that both the young Robert De Niro and Michael Douglas were in love with Sophie (played by Olivia Stuck).  Jump ahead 50+ years and they are all getting older and get together for a wedding that never happens.

I found the movie funny, sad, heartfelt, and definitely worth my time.  I can't wait to buy it on DVD for my collection.",1388275200,10,524,4.602150537634409
5309530,4,B009AMAOTQ,"This is ""Last Vegas"", a 2013 romantic comedy starring Michael Douglas, Robert De Niro, Morgan Freeman, and Kevin Kline. The four actors portray childhood buddies from the tough Flatbush neighborhood in Brooklyn, New York, who reunite in their senior citizen years for a bachelor party in Las Vegas. Very little in the weekend goes as expected, including their adventures in a casino, the outrageously fabulous bachelor party itself, and the raking over of some old grudges. A very pleasant surprise is Mary Steenburgen as a novice lounge singer, who does a credibly soulful job on some old favorites such as ""Only You."" You might have to be within hailing distance of the senior ranks to fully appreciate the humor of the movie, but it's fun to watch four very talented actors take on the premise and hobble away with it.

5309531,3,B009AMAOTQ,"Before launching into my review, I must comment that it took quite a while for Amazon to provide a review forum for ""Last Vegas"" (hereafter ""Last V""). So much time has passed that my memories of ""Last V"" have largely evaporated. It's really no wonder, because even though ""Last V"" features four Oscar-winning powerhouses (Michael Douglas as Billy, Robert De Niro as Paddy, Morgan Freeman as Archie, and Kevin Kline as Sam) having a wild, invigorating fling in one of the most outrageous cities in the world, it's only moderately enjoyable and surprisingly transient.

""The Golden Guys"" used to be close friends as pre-teens but, almost inevitably have grown apart and grown old. Each of the guys has his geriatric cross to bear, including languishing from children's overprotectiveness (Archie), lonely widowerhood (Paddy), or marital boredom and impotence (Sam). Only Billy seems to have really ""made it"" as some sort of  wheeler-dealer in some unspecified business. With Gordon Gekko hair, bleached choppers, and a complexion that makes George Hamilton look like an albino, formerly confirmed bachelor Billy plans to marry a pretty young lady half his age (whom he has proposed to during a funeral!). Billy starts calling and corralling his old pals to visit him in Vegas for his pull-out-all-the-stops bachelor party. Three of the guys, eager for a last fling, accept, but Paddy morosely refuses because of a smoldering grudge he holds against Billy for not attending his wife Sophie's funeral (Billy has his reasons). Still, the other three prevail upon Paddy to attend, but Paddy seems determined to cast a grumpy pall over all the fun.

The rest of ""Last V"" is basically the guys doing the usual Vegas things (like blackjack and roulette) and some off-the-beaten track things (like judging bikini contests and having trysts). Meanwhile, both Billy and Paddy make an unexpected acquaintance of a charming and wise lounge singer (Mary Steenburgen as Diana) and separately court her. Besides the Billy/Paddy feud, this romance provides what little tension and drama ""Last V"" has, not only because Billy has to decide whether to continue the relationship with Diana and abandon his marriage plans or not, but also any decision he makes will hurt Paddy again.

But of course in the final analysis ""Last V"", despite the racy and decadent Vegas environment, is a comfortably innocuous movie that reassures us that ""The Golden Guys"" and Diana will somehow make the right, happy decisions. If you like the four ""Old Fart"" legends (and who doesn't) you will generally have a good, humor-filled time. If you like watching Las Vegas in the movies, ditto.",1387411200,,2648,5.094470046082949
