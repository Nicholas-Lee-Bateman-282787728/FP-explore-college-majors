8706686,1,B00UGR0ITA,"Bambi, 1942 film

Adapted from the story by Felix Salten for America and the world of 1942. It opens on a gray murky world that soon changes to bright colors. Small furry animals appear, without any cares or concerns. What an idyllic world! How different from the events in front of the screen. This colorful land has only happy times. There is no unemployment, poverty, war, or hunger. April showers are followed by the sun's warmth. Bambi soon learns that there are places that are not safe, like the meadow (no mention of the danger). The scenes of the animal movements show artistic excellence; they must have cost a fortune. A flight of crows signal an alarm, and the deer flee into the forest. The danger is ""man in the forest"". [Isn't this just brainwashing young children?]

The snows of winter arrive. More scenes of animal movements pad out this story. The tough times show the hungry deer stripping bark from the trees (doesn't this kill trees and damage the forest?). Shots ring out, and Bambi's mother is gone. Spring brings singing birds in preparation for the summer. Bambi has grown antlers, and has matured. He battles and wins his mate. But men have come into the land, and there is danger. A pack of hounds chase poor Feleen. Bambi arrives to save her, and they escape. But a shot hits Bambi, and he falls. Fire spreads from the camp into the forest, destroying their habitat. Most of the animals escape to an island in the lake. Bambi is reunited with Feleen, and twins are born.

The excellent draftsmanship doesn't mask a weak storyline. I saw this as a child over 60 years ago, but remember little. This story was designed to be anti-hunting, and anti-human. Is such a perverse film fit for children? The depiction of those dangerous dogs may disturb some pet owners. What does this say about Walt Disney? The film does not show how man eliminated the wolves, panthers, and bears that preyed upon animals like deer. The film shows no conflicting interests, unlike the lawn outside where birds hunt and dispute their territory.",1524096000,,2049,4.717877094972067
