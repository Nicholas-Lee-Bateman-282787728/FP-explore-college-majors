741132,4,6303935419,"UNlike some of the other reviews, I found the film to be thought provoking and pretty darn funny. UNderstanding the zeitgeist releases an unusual perpective taking platform. One must understand the attempts that were taken to deliver an aversive attitude amongst the youth of that time. In one sense, we look at it and laugh only because we know (or at least some of us) the effects that are protrayed are exaggerated and/or false. However, when looking at the film as it was protrayed is quite another factor. Quite scary. The lies or maybe simply misinformation that powers-to-be were trying to invade us with are probably similar to things going on now that we are simply not aware of. What and who really is behind NIKE? Hee Hee.",985824000,4,733,4.734375
741133,4,6303935419,"I first saw this film in the auditorium of a SCHOOL, as a member of the entire  student body (that was a while ago)! Though it wasn't shown for  laughs, that was the end result. In society now, where ""Pot""  isn't something in which to cook dinner -- it was a hoot to see by the  acting while seemingly ""high,"" no one on-screen had ever smoked  pot. Yes, it's a ""Don't Do This"" type of film, but funnier, and  much scarier than the ""Duck and Cover"" films, or the ones shown  to servicemen before they were about to set foot on foreign soil in the  second World War.  -- (Sigh) -- We age...we learn.

741135,2,6303935419,"Made in the 1930's, it appears to be made as an educational film about the dangers of smoking marijuana. As society's awareness and knowledge about drugs has grown since then, this movie would flop as an educational film.  Today, the viewer should watch this film and enjoy, with humor, the  silliness of it.",955324800,,308,4.7924528301886795
741136,3,6303935419,"This is a hilarious flick.  It was a part of the hysteria over marijuana that afflicted America in the thirties.  Prohibition of alcohol was repealed in 1931 and Prohibition of marijuana was about to be born.  While  this film was NOT financed by the government as many people believe, it did  play right into their hands.  Many had a vested (as in financial) interest  in making marijuana illegal.  Certain corporations that shall remain  nameless had a stake in eliminating industrial hemp.  Creating a mythology  about the evil menace marijuana was a way to achieve that end.  This film  is hilarious due to the poor acting and mediocre special effects.  It is  about the quality you would expect if Barry McCaffrey decided to direct a  film today.  Of course this film is as comical as most of the rhetoric we  still hear today.  The blatant lies about reefer are still spread in some  circles today.  It is sick to admit to gaining such comic pleasure through  misfortune but being in on the lie helps.  It is a funny flick for anyone  interested in drug laws and in use of film to spread propoganda.  It is  hopped up lunacy at its best.",955238400,6,1143,4.59
741137,1,6303935419,"I found the quality of this DVD unwatchable. It was unclear, grainy, and had brightness levels that changed throughout the film. I wasted $$$$",951004800,6,142,4.958333333333333
741138,5,6303935419,"In the 70s, NORML spread the myth that the government sponsored Reefer Madness.  The truth, however, is that the film was made to play the Exploitation circuit... and was made with tongue firmly planted in  cheek.
Thelma White (Mae) has said that the cast was specifically asked  to ""hoke it up.""  And the scene in which Ralph demands that the  piano be played ""Faster... Faster!"" comes straight out of 42nd  Street--a film in which actor Dave O'Brien (yes, Ralph himself) had played  a chorus boy.
So, if the makers of this film weren't serious about their  message, why did they make the movie?  Well, why did anybody make an  Exploitation film in the 30s?  To show more skin than the Hays Code  allowed, of course, and to capitalize on public fears.  Simply put:  they  wanted to make money.  And make money they did.
Unlike most  Exploitation fare, Reefer Madness was shot over a period of three weeks, on  a relatively large budget (by sub-Poverty Row standards).  Using an  experienced director and a couple of actors who would go on to do  respectable work in Hollywood, this production is the creme-de-la-creme of  30's Exploitation cinema.
Reefer Madness is every bit as hyperbolic as  it was intended to be.  Just watch it knowing that its makers are laughing  at you, and you'll realize that this film is perhaps one of the greatest  jokes ever played on an audience in the history of cinema.  It's certainly  one of the most entertaining.",935798400,82,1450,4.737903225806452
741139,3,6303935419,Hillarious in the beginning however does drag later on.  What makes this film so interesting is that it was commissioned by the government to inform the public of the dangers of marijuana.  The film however is based entirely  on falacy and simply was a ploy to scare people into not smoking the drug.  A wonderful display of gov't integrity - HaHa.  It's pretty funny.,928627200,2,368,4.6875
741140,1,6303935419,"I found reefer madness to be a ""DRAG"" of a movie it was explotive Boring and contained not one piece of storyline that was even mildly intresting whatsoever the actors were amateur the ending was like something you would expect to see in some kindergarden play put together in about five minutes. The only satifying point of the movie was the closing credites because you realize this piece of garbage is over. The plot is about as complicated as a roadrunner cartoon some kid's try marjuana get hooked on it kill a women ,run over a man with a car, get sent to jai,l go crazy and get put into an institution .

741375,1,6303935419,"If cannabis is that harmful and deadly then why is it legal medically in over 20 states and completely legal in 2 states and 2 countries and no records of any death from an overdose. The real reason why it is illegal is because greedy businessmen (William Randolph Hearst, DuPont, and Mellon Bank) would have lost their fortunes to industrial hemp - a raw material for paper (instead of wood), and a raw material that can do anything petroleum oil can do. Hemp has thousands of uses and you can even make houses out of it. It is related to the cannabis plant, but industrial hemp can not get you high.
So, Hearst used his tabloid newspapers to call hemp and cannabis ""marijuana"" (Spanish for cannabis) and said that it was a drug being brought in from Mexico and is making people insaine and tricked everyone into thinking it was some other drug and not cannabis, which was the 2nd most prescribed medicine in the early 1900s.

I wish the government would let everyone see the hand grenade or how to dig a poop hole video. Now those are quit humurous. Anyone that has been in the service has been asked more than a million times if they ever smoked Mary Jane. In the service it seemed liked they wanted me to say I did. I was asked every day thought my career. Funniest moment was when I had diarrhea. The Commander came in and was all sympathetic and caring and talked to me while I sat on the craper. We talked about some deep emotional crap ( very touching hallmark junk) then he got real quit and glared at me with his laser beam eyes. He says, ""Son, now you be honest and straight with me. I care about you and your future. ...Have you ever or have you ever wanted or thought about or maybe even ever smoked weed whilst you knew it or not?"" ""No sir."".
"" you ever have dreams about smoking weed?"" ""No sir""

When this was shown in high school many years ago, we students laughed until tears rolled down our cheeks.  All the while, the teacher was screaming ""THIS ISN'T FUNNY, THIS IS SERIOUS.""

If all of the students were guffawing at this idiotic movie you would think that perhaps the teacher might have known that we'd all tried it at one time or another and knew that what they were showing was totally asinine.

Due to chronic intractable pain that NO NARCOTIC--Morphine, Oxycondone, Methadone--touches, I smoke medical marijuana.  IT WORKS.  Sadly, the DEA (Dramatically ""Egnorant"", A-holes) still has it listed a Schedule I, having NO medical purposes.  I've a feeling that I'll be bones and dust before they ever decide that it works.

not being well acquainted with reefer, i didn't realize the grave dangers associated with it.
golly, i sure wish i would have known a straight-shooter like the school principal in this movie.

i learned a lot:
+ reefer is the most dangerous drug of all, worse than heroin.
+ soda and rootbeer might be gateway drugs that lead to smoking reefer.
+ a reefer dealer can profit handsomely even if nobody ever pays him for the reefers they smoke.
+ reefer wasn't inhaled deeply in the 30s like it is in modern movies.  folks just puffed away at it until they threw the butt onto the floor.
+ practically everyone smoked cigarettes in the 30s with wild abandon.  probably because cigarettes are a safer alternative to reefers.
+ reefer makes you drive faster and faster and faster.
+ reefer smoke comes in brilliant colors.  the color of the smoke indicates just what kind of reefer smoker you are dealing with.
+ smoking reefers will turn you into a psychotic killer.
+ reefer smokers are awkward dancers.
+ refer makes you play the piano faster and faster and faster.
+ the only folks who laughed in the 30s were reefer smokers.  and their laughing was both inappropriate and disturbing!
+ jazz pianists are closet reefer smokers with bad hair.

741708,4,6303935419,"""Reefer Madness"" (the movie) is a piece of historical tripe, unintentionally campy in retrospect.  The film even tries to pound home the idea that, although cocaine and heroin are evil drugs, marijuana is even worse than them all.  Seriously.  The actors in this movie give the idea that with a minimum of one toke of a reefer and you're acting insane as a cuckoo.  The facial expressions are a riot, especially the guy playing the piano.  Wonton acts of sexual immorality and murder are all because one tokes a few.  Admittedly, the original might have been less ridiculous.  This is the result of having been edited by an exploitation director who took the original ""Tell Your Children"" and added some steamy salacious material to it.

Most of the actors I've never seen in anything else, so this may have been their first and last hurrah. You may, however,  recognize the guy who plays Jack as having been in a couple of John Wayne movies (notably ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"".  He's the guy who delivers the line ""...when the legend becomes fact, print the legend."" )

The movie itself is a riot if you don't take it too seriously.

This release, though, has an added bonus feature that makes it worth the extra money.  You get a T-shirt with the movie poster on it.  You couldn't buy the T-shirt by itself anywhere for as little as you have to pay for the DVD/T-shirt combo.

  well, the original 'Reefer Madness' is mostly a classic of bad cinema and unintentional humor. so it isn't really a matter of disrespect whether you re-dub this a la 'Wussup Tiger Lily' or you colorize it. and boy is the colorization here creative and imaginative and lively. the very problem with colorization is that it is un-creative and arbitrary to the B&W look of the original version. not at all in this wonderful 'Restored Edition'. there is great thought and care given to color conceptualizing. pot smokers blow out multi colored smoke. each smoker exhales their own individual colors. the result is trippy and hilarious. the canary yellow hit and run auto is also a psychedelic hoot.

Or rather, I watched a movie about people taking a hit.  I've heard certain things about ""Reefer Madness"", being an outrageously incorrect anti-marijuana film that only became entertaining by how kooky smoking marijuana has depicted.  When the movie began with a dangerous foreward, I was anticipated:

""Its first effect is sudden, violent, uncontrollable laughter; then come dangerous hallucinations - space expands - time slows down, almost stands still...fixed ideas come next, conjuring up monstrous extravagances - followed by emotional disturbances, the total inability to direct thoughts, the loss of all power to resist physical emotions...leading finally to acts of shocking violence...ending often in incurable insanity.""

That made marijuana sounds a lot more interesting than it actually does.  But once I've seen the whole 68-minute movie, it occurred to me that it had only seven minutes worth of people puffin' the magic dragon.  A tidbit for those planning to see this movie: SKIP THE FIRST TWENTY MINUTES.  Nothing happens in those twenty minutes, it's just a teacher arguing about drug use, some kids having fun, and a police officer asking question about drug-related crimes.  The characters and the setting are so white-bread and so formal, it's like watching an b-class educational video from the vintage days.  Once it got to the drug stuff, how people overreact to their illegal use was actually amusing.  One character that gave me entertainment value is a guy named Ralph Wiley, who mainly sits on his couch and laughing his butt off; and when he's paranoid, he makes silly faces.

""Reefer Madness"" tries to tell an audience something: if you smoke 'marihuana', it'll make you dance like an idiot, hack five people with an axe, sleep with multiple partners, and be falsely accused of murder done by someone who planted a gun in your hands so you can be the fallout boy.  Yea, how do the movie know the last part is drug-related and not circumstantial?  It didn't, and when it got serious, it got boring really fast.  The movie eventually became a sub-par court drama, and as I was watching, the actual criminals are a little too aware for those who are consumed by the grass.  For a 68-minute movie, so much of its time was spend dragging the plot, which became much less interesting because of it.  Why couldn't this film be just about people hashin' the pipe, driving the road under the influence and causing chaos?  At least that'll provoke a plausible scare tactic, as well as provide un-serious movie folks to enjoy the camaraderie.

It began as a simple morality piece produced by a church, but was taken over by one of the most infamous exploitation directors of the 30's.

Simply put, 'Reefer Madness' is terrible. It is one of the worst movies ever made. It had no artistic directorial style, dry dialogue, and inconsistent pace, and worst of all a complete lack of understanding about its subject matter. According the the filmmakers, marijuana users are uncontrollable, amoral, cackling madmen. One segment of dialogue even speaks of a young boy, a ""marijuana addict"" who, under the influence of the drug, butchered his family with an axe.

However, the film (terrible as it may be) is one of those films that are so terrible they are a joy to watch for the hilarity they bring. It is by far on the funniest non-comedies I have ever seen.

What makes the viewing of this film all the more rich is the masterful construction of this DVD. It gives us a somewhat remastered print, rendered in dizzying psychedelic color (with the black and white presentation for all those purists out there), and most important a commentary track by Mystery Science Theater 3000 alumni Mike Nelson.

The message in Reefer Madness is this; Take the classiest dames you can muster up, and give 'em a puff of that wacky weed. Soon they will be laughing and peeling clothes off left and right beyond all bounds. The more the merrier. Right?

Anyways... I love a good cult flick as much as the next, but in all truth, this movie is fun once, and then you'll probably never have any interest again.

Though I am hesitant to provide spoilers in a simple review, you kids should take notice: the next hit you take could be your LAST.  Or, Heaven forbid, you might become enamored of JAZZ music!

The newly colorized version of Reefer Madness from this DVD is a ""breath"" of fresh air for the unintentionally hilarious franchise that spawned a musical and 2001 remake.  Compared to other releases from Legend Films, the palate of Reefer Madness is much more vibrant and saturated, which actually artistically meshes with the film's subject material.  Thanks to the `60s and `70s, audiences have almost come to expect bright and aggressive use of color in any portrayal of drug use.  And since the film derives much of its present infamy from its cult status, the colorization process presumably connects it better with its target audience, those naughty high school and college students who have had almost nonexistent exposure to black and white cinema.

Of course, for us stodgy fuddy-duddies, the original black and white version is included as well.

Just by virtue of including both versions of the movie, this DVD is a great value.  Then you consider the special features, and it becomes better yet.

741878,1,6303935419,"Reefer Madness (Louis J. Gasnier, 1936)

For some reason, this weekend, there was a treasure trove of old movies I've always wanted to see scattered across our television. I started Sunday night's Depression-era extravaganza with Reefer Madness. Now, I'm fond of saying of bad movies--those with a certain &eacute;lan, anyway--that they're probably better watched through a haze of smoke that can only be generated by certain controlled substances referenced in the title of this film. This is the exact opposite; while I know it's grown to be a cult favorite among some of my, shall we say, more indulgent friends, I can't imagine a movie being any more of a buzz-kill than Reefer Madness.

It's amazing how much influence Leni Riefenstahl's Triumph of the Will had already had a year later; compared to earlier propaganda films, at least, Reefer Madness is a triumph of subtlety and decorum. That said, it would probably have been pulled off a whole lot better (and, ultimately, been a whole lot more dangerous) had the people who put this film together decided to exercise the merest standards in casting for this movie. In a film in which my main outrage should be directed to the absolute idiocy of the ""scientific studies"" on which the movie's script is supposedly based, I can't find it in myself to get past the quality of these actors. The first scene where we meet Bill Harper (Kenneth Craig) and his girlfriend Mary (Dorothy Short) is so painfully acted that I almost choked. On my water. Uhhhh, yeah, water, that's it.

It only gets worse from there. Honestly, it really is one of those movies so bad you have to see it to believe it. A lot of people seem to think that it's bad enough to tip over the line into that sort of cheesy brilliance one associates with Night of the Lepus, but it didn't catch me that way. Well, at least I can say I've seen it now. *",1182729600,4,1872,4.649546827794562
741879,5,6303935419,"Reefer Madness remains a cult favorite to this day. Originally produced to scare parents into keeping their children away from the scourge of marijuana, the film faded into obscurity after a brief while. It was rediscovered during the 1960s when, of course, all types of experimentation and drug use spiked up much higher than ever before. People then found the film to be amusing--and they are right. Reefer Madness was produced with good intentions but quite frankly it's a hoot to watch and sometimes you just can't help but laugh.

This generous DVD offers us both the restored black and white version released in 1936 as well as a colorized version. You can also choose to listen to a commentary during the movie or you can simply watch it straight through on your own. Mike Nelson of ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" does a great job with his running commentary. Either way, the film's scare tactics prove to be too lame for today's much more street wise people. If you want to scare kids away from drugs, Reefer Madness won't do the trick. The kids will probably be smart enough to just laugh at all the melodramatic scenes replete with over-the-top campy performances.

Reefer Madness tries its best to tell the story of the dangers of marijuana by showing us a few months in the lives of several high school students. In just this brief period of time they go from being the All-American Boys And Girls Club to being the horrific monsters who actually share intimacy before any wedding plans are announced--and they dance as if they're truly enjoying themselves! Of course, there's the obvious byproduct of playing the piano too fast, which in and of itself must be stamped out. The only truly serious scene in the movie--when someone gets bumped off--is probably the only time you'll experience a sense of sadness at the situation. Reefer Madness also points the finger at organized crime for distributing the drug.

Reefer Madness is best seen in its historical context as an outdated form of scare tactics meant to keep kids away from drugs; and it truly was produced with the best of intentions. However, with the passage of time and with new social mores and norms, the film plot becomes campy and hard to completely believe. The truth is most people laugh at it; and frankly it is pretty humorous, too.

The added short film entitled ""Grandpa's Marijuana Handbook"" by Evan Keliher is hysterical. Take a close look at that cat's eyes as the cat eats the leaves of the marijuana plant--man, is that cat stoned!

I highly recommend this DVD for fans of cult classic movies and people who want to take a look at how drug abuse was tackled in this country during the 1930s. The movie vacillates between true drama and mostly melodrama; so keep this in mind if you're looking for a truly dramatic flick.",1176681600,2,2810,4.75

Through this film we learn that the soul-destroying effects of Marihuana (Mike Nelson explains in the commentary that this film was made before the invention of the letter J) far surpass those of cocaine or heroin.  We see firsthand that even teens who can quote Shakespeare like nobody's business cannot escape its evils.

Here are some of the symptoms of casual Marihuana use:

 - laughing maniacally while running people down in the street

 - playing the piano too fast

 - having sexual relations with people you don't really like that much

 - accidentally shooting people you do like pretty well

 - having no recollection of being framed for murder

If your child has experienced any of these symptoms, he or she is a Marihuana addict.

Thanks to Mike Nelson's biting commentary, however, now the film really is funny. Damn funny. Which is why I demand we pass legislation, the sooner the better, requiring Mike Nelson commentaries on every major DVD release from here on out. He may be Hollywood's last best hope, the only man who can save excrement like Mission Impossible 3 and Lady in the Water from heading straight to the bargain racks.

(Okay, maybe I'm overrating Mike's abilities just a bit - nothing short of an Old Testament-style miracle could scrape the stink off of Lady in the Water - but if Lucas gave him a crack at Episodes 1-3, I think we'd be looking at pure marketing gold.

Instead of the usual symptoms like mild behavior and food cravings, these kids laugh like hyenas, engage in extreme sexual activities, and become very violent. One girl is even killed. Perhaps the film served as a warning in its time, but it is very laughable today. Not only are the kids stereotypical of perfect kids gone wrong, there are subliminal messages (4-20) and fake facts to back up the ridiculousness of the film.

741930,4,6303935419,"In the history of camp, the piano player getting high in the closet in ""Reefer Madness"" is as iconic as Scarlett vowing she will never be hungry again. There are lots of copies of this 1936 film out there on DVD and VHS, but do not be surprised if when the title comes up in the beginning is says ""Dope Addict,"" ""Dope Youth,"" ""Love Madness,"" ""Tell Your Children,"" or ""The Burning Question,"" because roadhouse pictures like this one kept getting reissued under different titles (although some argue that ""Tell Your Children"" is actually the original title). Actually, if you see a copy of this movie and the title of the actual film is ""Reefer Madness,"" count yourself pretty lucky. The important thing here is that you understand marijuana is dangerous. As the tag line for this movie points out: ""Women Cry For It - Men Die For It!"" So you know it is bad, very bad indeed.

The movie begins with Dr. Carroll (Josef Forte), principal of the local high school, warning the parents he has assembled against the dangers of marijuana and telling the story of Bill Harper (Kenneth Craig) and Mary Lane (Dorothy Short). The two youngsters attend a party at the apartment of Mae Coleman (Thelma White) and Jack Perry (Carleton Young), where joints are being given free to get the teens hooked. Also there are Ralph Wiley (Dave O'Brien), another student who likes Mary, and Blanche (Lillian Miles), a moll, who like Bill. Then Mary's kid brother Jimmy (Warren McCullum) gets hooked on drugs by Blanche and ends up killing someone in a hit-and-run while high. When Bill ends up with Blanche and Ralph attacks Mary, Bill goes after Ralph and during the fight a gun goes off and Mary ends up dead. Bill is innocent but he ends up on trial while the crooks try to cover up what really happened.

Justice triumphs in the end, but not before the wages of sin are played out while Dr. Carroll continues to provide stern lectures on the subject. The only problem is that by the time this film started making the college circuit in the late 1960s and early 1970s it was clear that smoking marijuana made you space out not laugh hysterically. So the great irony was that watching movies like ""Reefer Madness,"" ""Assassin of Youth,"" or the other anti-drug movies from the 1930s made you laugh hysterically (even if you were watching without contributing to the haze that hung in the air). This is the movie that defined ""camp"" for my generation.

""Reefer Madness"" also represents the birth of the exploitation genre, where as you long as you had that scroll at the introduction insisting your were doing a public service by warning the public against the evils of ________. You can put anything you want in that blank: marijuana, LSD, adultery, teen pregnancy, devil cults, and every thing else under ths sun that allows you to show sex and/or violence to the general public. When you see ""Reefer Madness"" you have not seen them all, just the tip of the exploitation iceberg. However, once you check out the original your best bet is to check out the musical version of ""Reefer Madness"" that was recently released. That way you can end your cinematic experience of the dangers of the demon weed on a high note.",1141171200,,3190,4.672597864768683
741931,1,6303935419,"Made and first released (as Tell Your Children) in 1936, when Prohibition still protected innocent youth from the purgatory of alcohol abuse, Reefer Madness began life as a morality tale to protect innocent youth from marijuana. Tell Your Children was a low-budget production, made by G&H Productions for a small church group.

The director had gained almost all of his experience in silent film. So, the facial expressions and gestures of the actors are exaggerated as they were in silent films. This ""problem"" became an asset later.

The movie begins with a Star Wars like scroll that touts marijuana as The Real Public Enemy Number One! The film hammers on marijuana so hard that at one point a doctor is relieved to find that his patient has only had heroin and not marijuana. Clearly, story, written by Laurence Meade, and the screenplay, written by Arthur Hoerl, could have used some validation by a real doctor with real drug treatment experience.

It was Dwaine Esper, a pioneer intellectual property pirate who bought the rights to the film, spliced in some salacious sex scenes and marketed the resulting Reefer Madness as an exploitation film. As a sensation exploitation of the marijuana menace, the film made some money for Esper. Then it fell into nameless disuse and eventually passed into the public domain.

In the early 1970s, Keith Stroup, a founder of The National Organization for Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), paid less than $300 for the film, cleaned it up, and began showing it at rallies. The pomposity and overacting were a big hit with the (frequently stoned) marijuana advocates.

Since then it has achieved cult status. It is up there with The Rocky Horror Picture Show.

All this would make Reefer Madness a genuinely funny viewing experience were it not for crack, and heroin. I felt bad watching this film, not because it was not uproarious camp, but because I live in the center of a fine, historical city where mothers try to sell you their crack babies, and heroin addicts mumble incoherently trying to panhandle in front of the halfway houses where they have been dumped.

If Amazon, or those who reap the profit on the sales of this DVD, would donate to quality rehab programs, I would feel less like taking a shower after watching this.",1140480000,6,2278,4.870801033591731

741934,3,6303935419,"Here is another one of those terrible and zany anti-marijuana films made by the government in the 1930's. It's much like the other, unknown actors, inept storyline, goofy dancing, and of course 'reefer cigarettes'. This film is not over the top hilarious like 'Reefer Madness', nor it does not have nudity like 'Marihuana'. It does not even have a decent story like 'Cocaine Fiends'. If you collect these films, this is a must for your collection, but personally, this is my least favorite.

A 'good girl' Joan, sets to inherit a small fortune from her grandmother, the only stipulation is that she be a 'good girl'. In steps Linda, the only real reason to watch this flick. She's the gold digging platinum blond with way too much eye makeup. She's really hot, I liked her alot. Anyway, she does everything she can to destroy Joan's reputation and get the money herself.

Of course being a 'bad girl' in the 30's must have been pretty easy. Joan is at an outdoor party and falls in the lake. She borrows a coat while her clothes are drying on the fire. Linda gets the clothes to catch fire, resulting in Joan coming home in only a coat. Wearing a coat and nothing else in 1930 means you are 'naked'. Linda also drugs Joan to get her to sleep the night at a strange house. When she comes home in the morning she is marked as a harlot by the town.

Well a newspaper reporter is trying to do a story on marijuana so he takes a job at a malt shop to be undercover. He meets Joan and uses her to break the story. In an unclimatic courtroom scene he bursts in at the last minute saving Joan's reputation and inheritance, while Linda is faced with her newly arrested reefer suppliers.

This film is pretty bad. The old coot who runs the soda shop is OK and has his moments in a Gabby Hayes type of way. The old lady who rides the moped is probably the funniest character. The film shows her leaving her house on the moped about four or five times. She'll go through the town proclaiming 'Joan's in jail! Joan's in jail!' She's basiclly the village gossip who needs to know and tell everybody about everything.

Reefer Madness is like the Three Stooges, black and white just adds to its charm. But to see it in color is quite a hoot. The smoke is purple and pink, the suits and dresses are LOUD, and the color scheme for Mae's apartment is just mind boggling. What more could you ask for? Well you get more anyway.

When I discovered that Mike Nelson from MST3000 fame actually had narrating duty, I just had to buy Reefer Madness again. He's hilarious. Sure it would have been great for his two robot buddies to join in, but who knows, maybe someday. Mike was right on the ball and I laughed out loud quite a few times. I never noticed before how much time the dope dealer spent making meals and eating.

Well if that wasn't enough, we also get a short 15 minute film starring Grandpa Ganja. He's a marijuana expert who's been smoking pot for over 30 years. He quotes weed from the Bible, convincingly explains how Moses was a major dopehead, and also the disciples. Not only do we get an indepth history on marijuana, he demonstrates how to roll a joint, smoke a bong, and other helpful hints on how to administer medical THC. The old man is hilarious on helpful hints as to buying and growing your marijuana. When they showed the real old dude throwing marijuana seeds over his fence and then harvesting pot in his neighbor's yard I lost it. Low brow pot humor true, but in any case I laughed my butt off.

Showing the public that the use of marijuana caused people to do irrational and immoral things, such as having pre-marital sex, getting violently paranoid, acting crazy, and even becoming a murderer, made the people respond. It is so obviously an inaccurate portrayal of people under the influence of the narcotic that it cannot be thought of as anything else but a hilariously ridiculous propaganda film, and in today's sense, a cult film (which can also be related to the short film ""Duck and Cover,"" as getting under a desk and covering your neck and head would not help during the explosion of the atomic bomb. However, I think that film was made just to make people feel more secure).

The film depicts the ""evil"" marijuana dealers as normal people who lure children into their homes and sell them the ""devil's drug.""

(This movie came on the heels of federal laws making marijuana illegal a few years earlier (1935 or 6, I think). It's an interesting glimpse into the early origins of America's early ""Just say no!"" style campaigns, utilizing new forms of media / technology.",1105833600,2,429,5.056338028169014
742013,5,6303935419,"This item is actually copyright-free, meaning that you can get it for nothing on the internet, which is why there are so many distributors selling it (just like Night of the Living Dead). A year before the Marijuana Tax Act was ILLEGALLY passed by congress (the law was passed on the bases that the Medical Association of America agreed with the new Drug Tsar that marijuana should be made illegal - they where not in agreement) this little piece of shock horror was released to national theatres using government funding to raise the issue of the dangers of using marijuana and then went on to the double-feature B-movie circuit because it proclaimed to feature smut and so made a few bucks back in the end. Most pot-heads, and those who like to laugh themselves off the sofa, love this movie because of its extreme outrageousness (as a note during World War 2, the US government produced a short film called Hemp for Victory in order to promote marijuana to help with the war [If you do not know what I am talking about read The Cannabis Grow Bible by Greg Green and The Emperor has No Clothes by Jack Herer) and is packed with campy acting.

The movie itself is quite old and is suffering from lots of age artefacts and noise with problematic sound at times and jump cuts are frequent, but what else can you expect from a 1936 government sponsored marijuana prohibition movie. Although this version is colorized to be honest it is a silly gimmick like what they did with Night of the Living Dead - my advice is to pass on it and find a friend who has a good burner because this is a copyright-free movie. The original, old and battered in black and white is way this is supposed to be seen.

The film is slow to start, but one of the highlights is there in the first few minutes, as a doctor holding an anti-drug conference tells us that Heroin, Opium and Coke are safer than the dreaded marijuana (yes, folks this is a government sponsored film, a year before marijuana prohibition took place). Then he tells us a sad story about one of his star pupils and this is what the movie Reefer Madness is all about. Within the space of ten minutes we meet the dealer (a slick-looking gagster type who sells the dope in his dame's apartment, where her brings people around to buy the dope and party) who offers one young man to take him to meet his boss (a chap who looks like an accountant, hitting buttons on his accounting machine and complaining about how much more hop he needs to sell to kids). Within the space of five minutes, after that young mans first joint, he has managed to race down town at top speed where he murders a pedestrian... all because he had a spliff!!!... but that is not all!

Back at the marijuana hole, another man with blonde hair is slowly going crazy on the couch. Then he smokes a marijuana joint and proceeds to try and force himself quite violently on a woman. In the back bedroom a kid has cheated on his girlfriend and is feeling guilty about it not knowing that his woman is the one in the other room being assaulted... all because of the DREADED MARIJUANA. While all this is going on the Doctor at the start of the show is concerned that some of his students are using marijuana and is complaining to the head of a narcotics bureau and is grassing them all up. We learn in this conversation that a marijuana smoker had a joint and then axed his family to death... but shock horror!! That is not all! There is something even worse... a woman was found in a room with five other men smoking a reefer. Well now! Something MUST be done!

Back at the apartment someone gets shot and a guy is so stoned that he thinks he did it. In the meantime the rapist is sitting in the corner demanding more reefers. Eventually he goes insane and everyone goes to jail... but not before there is a bit of poker head action at the end with a blond dame giggling manically in the corner.... because he has the terrible...

Reefer Madness!!!

The funny thing is that this piece of film actually worked and got people believing that marijuana is some crazy demon drug that will vaporize your life. In fact in the millions of years of evolution that we have been using this plant safely, it has only been made unsafe by crackpots in governments who come up with crazy schemes like this one to make everyone's life a misery. 0 people die from using cannabis every year. How many people die from all these DEA related marijuana drug busts every year? How much money ends up in the hands of terrorists? How much of the actual black market produce is mostly poison? Grow your own. And with that I leave you with - The Cannabis Grow Bible by Greg Green, Cannabis Cultivation by Mel Thomas, Marijuana Botany by Robert Clarke and Hashish by Robert Clarke. It is easy and more rewarding than you can imagine... ....actually imagine A+ reefer without the madness *wink*.",1095552000,17,4874,4.458520179372197

742075,5,6303935419,"To address xerxes59's question about the urban legend:
I never heard any evidence about Dupont funding Reefer Madness, but they would have a motive.
Dupont was facing enormous loses because their inventions rayon and nylon could not compete with natural hemp (in quality, cost effectiveness, not to mention environmental friendliness).  Andrew Mellon, US Treasury Secretary and chairman of Mellon Bank, one of the major financers of Dupont, did appoint Harry Angslinger (who was also married to his niece) as Commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Narcotics.  As seen in Ron Mann's documentary ""Grass"", Angslinger was an extremist zealot who managed to criminalize marijuana and create ridiculous sentences for smoking pot. One of Angslinger's methods was to demonize pot with completely false evidence throughout the various media (newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst, whose financial interests in paper mills was also being hurt by hemp, was a great ally). Of course this is a tenuous connection between Dupont and Reefer Madness, but Dupont clearly had a direct financial interest in demonizing reefer, just like the movie attempts to do.",1086048000,5,1145,5.463276836158192

742079,4,6303935419,"This movie is a great source of camp, and one of the only movies out there that unintentionally serves as its own satire.
I heard an urban legend that perhaps someone more knowledgeable could clarify for me.  It goes something like this: Prior to this film, marijuana was legal (or, at least, not illegal).  A chemical company (that still exists today, so I will refrain from using its name) made a chemical used in the process of making paper from wood pulp.  Paper made from hemp (marijuana), however, did not need this chemical and was thus cheaper to produce.  The chemical company, therefore had a great financial stake in demonizing (and eventually outlawing) the marijuana plant so that it could sell its chemical to paper manufacturers.  It was this company that financed and distributed Reefer Madness, which was part of a propaganda campaign to make marijuana (and thus hemp) illegal.
Does anyone out there know if this is even partially true?",1082505600,3,953,4.894409937888199

It can be argued that there is a reasonable belief that those who made ""Reefer Madness"" were doing so simply to warn the public about the dangers in the use of Marijuana. But after watching it and rewatching it and watching it again, the question that comes to my head and crowds out all others is whether the makers of ""Reefer Madness"" were driven mad by smoking reefer before they made this movie. Simply put, were these people high???
What is supposed to have shock value comes off as camp and it is indeed ironic that Amazon.com packages this movie together with ""Plan Nine from Outer Space"" in that Ed Wood had every intention of being campy and succeeded and the makes of ""Reefer Madness"" had no intention of being campy and failed miserably.
So why the four stars? Well, we do learn much from ""Reefer Madness."" For one, we can see how overacting can be the downfall of a movie. We also see parallels between the campy techniques in ""Reefer Madness"" and modern day ""news magazine"" television shows that try to scare the viewer. Finally, we learn that it is okay to like something for what it is and not for what it was meant to be. ""Reefer Madness"" was supposed to educate the public on the dangers of marijuana. What it turn out to be was a fascinating character study of the insecurities of Americans during the 1930's played out on stage by rejects from the commmunity theatre.",1058572800,,1440,4.607003891050583

Watch 1930s era police and federal agents make drug busts and incinerate thousands of dollars worth of drugs. But we all know that for every pound of weed seized by the U.S. Government, a thousand pounds is enjoyed by decent law abiding pot heads. Nothing has changed in seventy years.
The movie starts out with a scrolling written warning of the perils of the demon-weed. It could happen to you, you.or YOU! Then a preachy, holier than thou high school principle is addressing parents of the student body. He begins to tell a story that happened right here in our neighborhood.
Our story unfolds and lo and behold, decent, clean-cut, American youth succumb to the evils of Mariuhana. Watch a decent youth smoke a joint in his car, then run down an old man in the street. He doesnt even slow down after he clobbers the guy. Remember, this is the 30s cars weigh half a ton and are made of steel. And watch the crazed piano player at the soda stand takes a smoke break. He looks like an insane derelict as he smokes a joint in the closet.
Anyway, May and her drug-dealer boyfriend lure young kids into their house and offer cigarettes to get them high and hooked. Of course the evil drug causes insanity, jealousy, rage, horniness, and nervousness. A girl gets shot, the drug dealer gets beaten to death, and his girlfriend launches herself out a window after she confesses.
Of course everybodys favorite is the dude who needs to go to the loony bin for the criminally insane. He is so enslaved to demon weed that he no longer has a brain of his own.

But this one reel wonder is absolutely fascinating. In the censored days of the Hays Code you could not depict people getting stoned, or a woman being raped unless it was prefaced with a speech villifying wantoness and deviance. If you wanted to tell a racy tale on film in that  era, the way to do it was make it a P.S.A and then practically no holds were barred. In Cocaine Fiend, Sex Madness, Traffic in Souls, By You A Drink Sailor? and others, drug use, debauchery even mild nudity, (by N.Y.P.D Blue standards) was permissible, just so long as you made sure to to open with a warning that declared that these acts were intollerable. These films come the closest to giving us a realistic look at the way things were in that era, as opposed to the censored movies of the day and the watered down versions told by the people who lived it. The Ozzie & Harriet types that grew up in that era and went onto become the parents of the 50s Rock N Rollers, were a lot hipper than they get credit for. They had been around and knew the score.

Who knew pot could make you play the piano like a fiend and throw yourself out of a windows?  paying just enough attention to enjoy the ""good parts"" while tuning out the rest in favor of conversation.

When this film was made, pot was still legal, although it was an, um, hmmmm, exotic pleasure that wasn't familiar to most middle class whites, who were happy with their scotch, thank you.
I seriously doubt that Reefer Madness had much to do with the success of the anti-weed campaign, however. In fact, it may have set it back a few years. This movie is so stupid that the first time I saw it, I assumed it was a parody. Anyway, I hope the VHS is good quality; me, I own a 16mm print.
Obviously no one who worked on this film has ever been high. Or even drunk. Heck, I doubt anyone who worked on this film has ever spun around in a circle until he felt dizzy. My favorite part is the hardcore addict sucking on his doobie like a dying emphysematic sucking on an oxygen tube, all the time shaking and giggling at a private joke.
I won't give away the ""plot,"" such as it is, but the nice middle class kids here are doing things after a couple of tokes that would drive most heroin addicts to the nearest methadone program.
By the way, that reefer, if you didn't know it, is a gateway drug to listening to jazz music, and implicitly to association with such low-lifes as dealers, addicts and musicians. (An' mebbe dem culored people as well.) This movie is everything that's wrong with didacticism.
But it's so freaking silly, that everything it says is an antithesis. If this film is racist, then racism must be wrong. If the film looks down on jazz, then jazz must be pretty cool.

According to the first ten minutes of this quasi-documentary, Marijuana is more insidious and addictive than heroin and cocaine. it causes hallucinations and violent behavior, and it eventually ends up driving a person insane with no hope of recovery. And here I always thought smoking pot led to chronic munchies followed with long naps and a decline in wanting to do anything more strenuous than watching ""The Wall"".
  The rest of the movie demonstrates that by showing how these ""drug dealers"" lure high school kids up to their apartment (no not a club that they can skip out of if the cops move in but to their actual residence) to engage in marijuana induced orgies. Well, before you know it they're running people down and being framed for killing their girlfriends by the mobsters. Poor kid is too wigged out on weed to know that they planted the gun in his hands after shooting the girl. I guess they didn't check for powder burns back then.
  There are some hysterical parts like when they show the pianist at a soda shop wigging out on the keyboard with a wild look in his eyes, and later you see him toking up in the back closet, or when the good kid is asked to go to the soda shop by a friend and he adamantly says ""I don't drink that stuff!"".

742130,5,6303935419,"Originally called ""Tell Your Children"", this hideously inaccurate film about ""the dreaded marihuana"" is a scream, even if you're like me and don't smoke it.  This was a cheapie exploitation flick, supposedly condemning even though it was really intended to titillate the audience.  As a result, this film is bookended with hyper-puritanical speeches that are truly a riot.  Among other bits of useful information, we're told marijuana is more dangerous and deadly than cocaine or heroin, and that ultimately the marijuana smoker will suffer ""incurable insanity.""  We're not even halfway through the opening crawl, folks!
The plot itself is equally preachy.  Wait until you get a load of the ""incurable insanity"" or any of the plot ""twists"" that drag all the characters down.  It's a bit of a sad irony that now, in terms of accuracy, this movie has more relevance; more and more marijuana being sold is being laced with PCP or similarly nasty drugs.  Back in the thirties, ""Reefer Madness"" was hideously inaccurate; now, occasionally, it's not far off the mark.
So who dug this out?  Surprisingly, it was legalization group NORML.  It entered the public domain in the 70s, well after NORML found it in the Library of Congress, made some prints and went to town, using it as a fundraiser.  And boy, did it ever raise funds.  Midnight screenings went through the roof, and it penetrated the public consciousness in a way the filmmakers never intended.

Additional barriers (besides time) between the current viewer and the directors' original vision amount to disregard, at best, and contempt, at worst for both the originator and the consumer, all for a quick, small profit. I don't mind paying more for fidelity. I love my Criterion DVD's and paid handsomely for them.",1518652800,,1382,4.730290456431535
