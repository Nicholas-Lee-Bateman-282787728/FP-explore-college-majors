1592655,1,B00005JONU,"This film was just terrible.  Not only was the acting poor, but I am convinced that they are only in the top five because they've stressed the patriotism of the film so much, that people who are voting think ""if I don't vote for this film, the terrorists have won."" i wish i could give zero stars...",1128297600,4,299,4.245614035087719
1592656,1,B00005JONU,"I'm a sucker for anything that has to do with WWII, but the subject can never be done justice with a low bugit production. It's great that they found a jeep and a truck but that does not equal authenticity. The silly firecracker effects and cheezy dialogue sucks you right out of the film and reminds you why certain subjects should be left to Mr. Spielberg. It's clear that the creators of this film studied Saving Private Ryan to much for their own good. It was an ok attempt, but next time they should tackle something a little more within their league and not take themselves to seriously.",1128297600,4,593,4.5
1592657,5,B00005JONU,Since the talents involved with the making of this short film have succeded in literally every area of expertise with only a very small budget/timeframe to work with...I am excited and can only imagine the incredible outcome with details in place when this becomes a major film experience. This short film explodes with the pressure to be told to the world in a mighty way !!!,1128297600,,376,4.712121212121212
1592658,5,B00005JONU,This is the type of filmmaking I would like to see more of.  It had substance and dealt with humanity tenderly.  We could use a little less ping pong and a little more of this.,1128297600,6,176,4.0
1592659,5,B00005JONU,"I DON'T USUALLY LIKE WAR STORIES, BUT THIS SMALL CLIP LEFT ME WANTING MORE.  THIS FILM PORTRAYED THE EFFECTS OF WAR ON CIVILIANS AND SOLDIERS AND THE HUMAN SUFFERING OF WAR.  JUST THIS SHORT CLIP MADE ME CRY.",1128297600,8,208,4.447368421052632
1592660,5,B00005JONU,"I really enjoyed this film.  It was apparent from the start that they had paid attention to fine details.  The action was fast-paced and intense.  I also expecially enjoyed the acting of the the captain and the photographer/artist.  All in all, it is a very well made film.",1128297600,7,273,4.625
1592661,5,B00005JONU,This is a heart-felt film that shows the timelessness of family and karma. It was excellent! I truly enjoyed this film. The production values were of high calibre and the acting was honest. Truly a professional film.,1128297600,9,216,4.864864864864865
1592662,5,B00005JONU,Jeff Rose has written a compelling story based on his grandfather's experiences in WWII.  The production values make it look like a much more expensive film.  Great work from the actors and terrific special effects!,1128297600,7,215,5.114285714285714
1592663,5,B00005JONU,"This short film literally blew me away.  World War II is a huge event to take on and I am very impressed to see it done in a short film competition.  The music is beautiful, and when used it really helps to reinforce the emotion in the film.  The story begs to be told in a longer version, which I hope we will see at some point in the future.  So many short films rely on a single gimmick or joke, so it is great to finally see one with a broader and more challenging scope.",1128297600,8,475,3.9166666666666665
1592664,3,B00005JONU,"You can tell that the filmmaker put alot of effort into making the viewer feel like he/she is right there taking fire on the mountain like the soldiers.  I sympathize with the storyline but there were some things that didn't make sense to me.  For example, I don't believe the woman in the beginning is Italian - she switches back and forth between an overkill Italian accent and what is clearly American English and that distracted me.  And why are those nice Italians having a PICNIC in the middle of a war zone?  Finally, I don't believe that a reporter would stick around in the middle of sniper fire just to DRAW a picture of the battle scene.  Overall though, a good effort.",1128124800,6,680,4.495934959349594
1592704,1,B00005JONU,"I am just curious why the soldier doesn't remove his hand from his helmet...

I am just curious how the bomb disintegrates both soldiers, but keeps the paper intact...

I am just curious why those people decided to picnic in the middle of a war zone...

I am just curious why the guns sound like cap guns...

I am just curious why there are some people who actually like this movie...But I guess you have to support your family or friends--even if they produce a garbage film like this one!

Let me suggest a few films and filmmakers for the director to watch--maybe he can learn a thing or two....

Kubrick--esp. Full Metal Jacket--if you decide on another war film.

Scorsese--Any one of his films...

Ford

Hawks

Hitchcock

Welles

Also...watch Platoon, Patton, and Apocalypse Now

These are just a few suggestions--it might help, big guy!",1130457600,,843,4.731034482758621

1592707,1,B00005JONU,"CLICHE! CLICHE! CLICHE!  they even threw in the 'save the crying baby through a hail of gunfire' scene.  yawn.

1592708,1,B00005JONU,"Wow, I've served in desert storm and this movie just made me mad. Using the blanket of patriotism to create something as simplistic and deceiving as this is downright wrong.

War is horrifying. The noble sacrifices that all soldiers make for the price of freedom should be given portrayed with some truth and realism. This movie did not do it justice.

Spielberg got it right. I admire this movie's message, but I'm sorry, it just didn't do anything for me.",1130371200,2,457,4.7

1592711,2,B00005JONU,"Come on people--I just read some of the reviews for this film and I gotta tell ya I'm just not seeing it. A serious subject such as this is cheapened by poor acting and senseless action attemps. Could someone please tell the actor who had his hand on his helmet for the whole 7 mins to find some other action for his hand. I should actually blame the director for letting the hand remain glued to this poor saps skull. I don't know why this film annoyed me so much, perhaps it just seems like a cheap way to show off. The problem is the director missed his opportunity to do so. The running of actors in and out of frame was silly, the sound effects for the weapons sucked and the acting was terrible. Some of the shots were well planned but in the end miss the mark because the film is mired with all sorts of other garbage that takes away form the supposed seriousness of the situation. You have talent kid, next time don't aim so high. You don't have a 100 million dollar budget and it shows.",1130371200,6,995,4.214659685863874
1592712,5,B00005JONU,As important now as it was then on how important individual effort is for the greater good of all. An excellent short (albiet a bit cheezy on the FX)that takes a bit of history and expands on it.,1130371200,5,195,4.157894736842105

1592756,5,B00005JONU,"Hats off! Incredible-Battaglia opens your mind to escape the all too common movie plot clich.  With every scene there is a surprise that cannot be pre-determined.  This screening was not a course in history or military strategies as I read some of the re-views downing the film. The museum looks very much like the WWII museum in Italy.  This film draws vivid emotional experiences that were captured and the message was delivered to us, the viewers. A perfect beginning to the ideal ending! (remarkably done and it's only 7 minutes short and the cinematography, storyline, costumes, etc. all done in only 3-4 days?)  You portrayed life, death, courage, integrity, hope, love and honor-I was privileged to watch this invigorating tribute to a grandfather. I believe there is a spiritual component to this film and viewers are in need of movies with meaning.  I watched about 280 of these screenings and this one by far is the best.  You didn't have to use sex, drugs, profanity or alcohol to get your point across.  High regards to the filmmakers for knowing exactly what they wanted to accomplish, and did it with dignity.

1592757,5,B00005JONU,Great piece of workmanship! I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It is an excellent representation of our past in WWII. The production value makes this look like a big budget feature.,1130198400,4,179,5.0
1592758,3,B00005JONU,This is the second movie I watched on this competition.  It wasn't bad but I think it needed better sound effects for a war movie. but overall pretty good.,1130198400,,155,4.344827586206897
1592759,4,B00005JONU,"War films are difficult to pull off in general, let alone in a short film, but the filmmakers have outdone themselves. The production value alone makes this short film worthwhile.

The story is a poignant one and definitely needed to be told. The book ending in present day is an effective and nice touch. Especially as the heroes from that time period pass on, we need to be remembered of their sacrifices.

The acting is decent. The sound effects were good, but not completely authentic to the time period. And the CG missle or grenade did not look right, especially since so much detail had been paid to the rest of the short film.

Overall, well made.",1130112000,4,655,4.581196581196581
1592760,5,B00005JONU,"Hats off to Owen for tackling one of the most difficult genres to capture on film. Accurate and believeable filming of battle scenes in war films is not an easy feat, and Owen and crew accomplish this with the skill of a bigtime director/producer on a hollywood budget. As someone who has attempted to flim a scene of this nature (and failed miserably in comparison), I congratulate you all for a job well done and I appreciate your atention to such a poignant subject.",1130112000,3,469,4.595238095238095
1592800,5,B00005JONU,This is a gem. Well acted and produced. How many heroes of war died without any left alive to tell their story of courage? This reminds us to remember. Thank You.,1130112000,4,162,4.258064516129032
1592801,5,B00005JONU,"It was a very pleasant surprise to be moved to tears by this film. This was a very original twist on what I was expecting from a ""war movie"". For this entry I wish it could have gone beyond more than 7 mins.",1130025600,3,207,3.8372093023255816
1592802,2,B00005JONU,"I liked the effort and attempt of this film, but not the film overall. I respect the logistics behind gathering the vehicles, uniforms, weapons, etc. However, it reminds me of an interview with George Lucas where he criticized other Sci Fi movies who built elaborate sets and then spent a great deal of the movie showing off the set despite the fact that the story was not progressing. The story of Battaglia was nice, but this movie has been made before. For this competition I would like to see the film makers take more risks. This one did not. The story was formulaic and the dialogue was campy.",1130025600,,599,4.555555555555555
1592803,5,B00005JONU,"""Battaglia"" by Jeff Rose is an excellant piece of work and introduces to viewer to the Invasion of Italy period of WW2 which is considered to be the least documented phase of all of WW2. The films story line, photography and editing are engaging and first rate.

The 88th Infantry Division was the first organized Reserve Division to go overseas, and also the first to enter combat. During the time it was in combat, from March 4 1944 to May 2 1945, the Blue Devils suffered over four thousand battle casualties, of whom twelve hundred were killed in action.

My uncle was Pfc. Felix B. Mestas, Jr., AKA ""The Unknown Hero of Battle Mountain"". Visit [...] to learn more about Mestas, the 88th Infantry Division Blue Devils, Mount Battaglia (Battle Mountain) and what Jeff's grandfather experienced there.

The historical value of Rose's ""Battaglia"" is quite significant in contributing to the preservation of the history of our family members who fought and died during WW2.

I look forward to being able to add the film ""Battaglia"" to our Blue Devils Archives.

1592805,3,B00005JONU,"This film is admirable in its attempt...

The acting was decent, and the special effects were decent, the cinematography was decent. But this film did nothing new or interesting and quite frankly, it was a little melodramatic and contrived at the end.

In all honesty, the cursory nature of the entire production shows through a little too much.",1129939200,,345,4.931034482758621

1592860,5,B00005JONU,"Historical events, including wars, are oftentimes impersonal written words to those of us in a distant gap from the actual timeline .  The film BATTAGLIA transcends that gap and points out that these events featured participants that were our fathers and grandfathers who were forever touched by the war and who impacted today's participants in life's drama so much more that an ordinary trip to a museum might reveal.

  BATTAGLIA really is a superior short film that is worthy of Tribeca's top award.",1129593600,5,502,5.0120481927710845

1592868,5,B00005JONU,I'm glad it made the finalists because it's the best short I have seen in competition. It's beautifully shot and looks very professional. The acting is good and the story deals with a heartfelt issue. It  definitely is no overreaching tearjerker and yet the way it all comes down together brought a tear in my eye (and that's a rare occurance even with feature films). It avoids being political about more recent situations that could be compared to the subject and it remains a very touching human story.

Remembering the reporter as a hero risking his life to tell the story of ""The Heroes"" was great.  The Unsung Hero of the war is recognized.

Impressed you shot and edited in four days.  That sais a lot about your commitment.  Only thing I have to say on the downside is sometimes I felt like it was shot in the woods near my house.",1129075200,4,551,4.1415094339622645

1592896,3,B00005JONU,"While it is common knowledge that almost every filmmaker is influenced by the films and filmmakers he or she admires, an unfortunate effect of too much admiration is that one does not develop a cinematic style that is wholly one's own.  Just as we can readily identify the cinematic style of Scorsese vis-a-vis Spielberg or Lucas vis-a-vis Cimino- we can also recognize when up and coming filmmakers have consumed too much of the style of others to have a style of their own.  Battaglia is just such a film, by just such a filmmaker.  From the frame story (reminiscent of Cameron's TITANIC) to the war action (reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan or any recent film about World War II, the style of the film is too derivative and dulls the heroic tale.  Although the filmmaker certainly spent a great deal of effort constructing very interesting shots (particularly the wide shots with multiple planes of action criss-crossing our field of view)there is nothing that hasn't been seen before.  The use of sound is particularly disappointing- in spite of the fact that much of the excitement of the shots and the story depends on the use of sound.  We remember how Sam Peckinpah demanded authentic sounding gunfire for his Western Epic THE WILD BUNCH and because he demanded such authenticity- his Western was immediately different than all other Westerns because of this simple insistence.  The same is not true here in Battaglia, too much of the gunfire and war sounds do not sound authentic.  The dangerous cachopony of sound that represents war is created as much through silence as it is through bombs and bullets.  I feel the filmmaker went too far in the wrong direction by not using silence to his advantage- particularly in the scene where the two soldiers walk together.  Silence would have made his sudden death a greater shock for the audience.  We would do well here to remember Robert Rossen's A WALK IN THE SUN as a reference point.  To sum up, to do any kind of film now about WWII one must look further in the past for influences or find alternate ways to make one's vision authentic (sound and silence) are just a few of those ways.  Battaglia's heroic story deserves to be told, but it must be told as uniquely as possible to stand in the company of the other great war films that depict that period.",1128988800,,2315,4.714640198511166

1592898,3,B00005JONU,This film plods along which is a sad thing to say of something so short. A sentimental storyline is overshadowed by the poor delivery of clishes and perfuctory head nods. Two critcal scences showing bravery are underacted and underdeveloped. Additionally the setting looks like a hiking trail and the ammunition like handfuls of dirt.

1592955,4,B00005JONU,"I have known most of the people on the Battaglia team for some time and I can honestly say, without hesitation, that they would not try to cheat their way to a win under any circumstances. This only seems a necessary disclosure because of the recent allegations, accusations and other inflammatory remarks being made across the review boards. It's a shame to have to begin this way, but it only seems right in light of recent posts.

I can say, with all certainty, that the Battaglia crew did not try to elicit high ratings from friends and family. I was encouraged to vote my conscience, but above all, to vote. Let's be honest here, voting will never be totally rational or unbiased. Your mother, in all probability, wouldn't give your movie 1 star. Her review will probably be of the `glowing' variety as well. Is that wrong? More accurately, it's the nature of the beast. Will your best friend look at all the movies with complete objectivity? Again, probably not. Are you going to beg someone to go vote for your film, who you know, will trash it? No. You're going to hope that person doesn't find out all your hard work is `out there' waiting to be `critiqued.'  So, if you ask your mom to vote for your film and don't go out of your way to share it with those that would do your rating harm... is that cheating?

We can only be thankful that there are a lot of people out there voting who don't know anyone involved and that can also get beyond a, ""this movie sucks - I give it a 1 because there's not a zero."" mentality.

The Battaglia team did go out of their way to get the word out, to everyone, that the contest was on. They spread the word to those who could help and potentially hinder them, indiscriminately. Good thing for a lot of us, because I would have completely missed it. We were also encouraged to go vote again. This, as far as I understand, is how it works. You vote the first time to get the films narrowed down to five... then, you vote again to help determine the winner.

After viewing all five films, there is a reason that these are in the running. Some of these reasons include: strength and originality of story, scale of production, character/acting, editing, photography, etc. None of these films hits all these marks, but each piece shows proficiency in all these areas. If a film falls short on production value, a great story can, and will, elevate it in the mind of the reviewer. If the acting is somewhat lacking, but there is a great story and it looks good, the same can be said. Basing a low score or bad review on the fact you `don't like thrillers/war movies/etc.' is not helpful.

If everyone can try to be objective on this level and write an honest and constructive review of a film, without resorting to some of what we've seen here over the last few weeks, the film makers and Amazon/Tribeca will be one step closer to achieving their goal.

--------------------------

This just proves my point. One, I am NOT the director. To my knowledge he hasn't posted on this board. Two, apparently you didn't actually read the 'long winded review.' A review it is NOT. Three, justifying anything about the actual film Battaglia, it did NOT. Four, pointing out that posts like yours are the waste of bandwidth... it DID.

If you are going to post inflammatory remarks and accuse me or anyone else of anything, please try to scrape together a fact or two before doing so. This is my last post here for any reason. If anyone wants to continue this flame war, everyone will see it for what it is.

1593069,4,B00005JONU,"First, I would like to congratulate the makers of this film on doing a great job.  I feel as though your film has been attacked by the makers of other films, ""Duel at Red Table"" in particular.  This attack is for good reason.  Your film is very strong and presents a problem in their quest to win this years competition.  I applaude your team for your display of class in dealing with lowlifes like this.  I also don't blame Mr. Rose one bit for defending himself against attacks from people of very low integrity.

Now, my review of ""Battaglia"".  The first thing that jumps out at me is the quality for which this film is made.  The scenes are well shot down to the lighting and every angle.  The war scenes are intense and really grab the audience.  The story is what makes the film.  To get this much content into just seven minutes is remarkable.  I find myself adding to the story saying, what if you added this here, and that there.  You have so much more of a story to tell and I definitely encourage you to shoot a longer version.  I feel this film is a 'thinking man's' film.  I have read so many critiques on this film that have your viewers asking questions about the characters (Is the old lady at the museum the girl in the field?, Does the couple know their grandfathers paths crossed?)  I think the fact that viewers are asking these questions and, thus, still thinking about the film when it ends probably means that your intention of leaving the audience to wonder was successful.  I rate your film four stars just because I am stubborn about handing out five stars.

1593140,5,B00005JONU,"I enjoyed ""Battaglia"".  The film quality, lighting and sound were excellent for a short  and I believe that the makers of the film made the most of their special f/x budget. Even with a limited capapcity to recreate mortar fire, I found the war sequence on the mountain to be entirely believable and was drawn into the story by the action.  Through their edting of the action, they were not only able to pack quite a bit of story into a short time frame, but were also able to draw the viewer almost immediately to the characters (no easy feat with so little time to work with).

I found the work of the actors to be quite credible and their deft handling of the dialogue brought the viewer smoothly to the poignancy of the ending sequence.  I found that I actully wanted to find out how this short story was going to wrap up.

One note on the ending: one of the other reviewers seemed to indicate that the journalist was the grandfather of the couple in the ending sequence.  The man and woman were a married couple, so I would hope they do not share a grandfather.  What I got from it was that the woman's grandfather was the Capt. (she is shown touching his picture and referring to him as ""PaPa"") and the man's grandfather was the journalist.  Meaning that after the Capt. and journalist shared this experience together on the mountain in Italy during WWII (and perhaps even met their fate together although it was not entirely clear if the Capt. also died as a result of the mortar round) their decendents eventually met and fell in love with each other, each never knowing that their grandfathers had ever crossed paths.  If that was the entent of the plot, it could have been made a little more clear.  Or maybe I'm just reading too much into it.  I'll have to watch it again to see.

At any rate, a very nice film and head and shoulders above the other entrants that I have reviewed.

Well done, and thank you.",1128470400,5,1918,4.411931818181818

1593146,4,B00005JONU,"In Hollywood mythology, great battles wheel and turn on the actions of individual heroes. In ``Battaglia,'' thousands of terrified men are thrown into the face of withering German fire.

The movie's battle sequence is as intense as any war footage I've ever seen. In fierce dread and energy it's on a par with Oliver Stone's ``Platoon,'' and in scope surpasses it--because in the bloody early stages of this surprise attack the Allies and the enemy never meet eye to eye, but are simply faceless masses of men who have been ordered to shoot at one another until one side is destroyed.

The camera makes no sense of the action. That is the purpose of this style. For the individual soldier on the mountain, the attack was a chaos of noise, mud, blood, vomit and death.

This battle sequence is necessary to establish the distance between those who give the orders to fight and those who are ordered to do the fighting. For Capt. Cox and his men, the taking of the mountain has been a crucible of fire. For reporter Sidney Carter, war seems more remote and statesmanlike. His editors most likely question the wisdom and indeed the possibility of a mission to capture the mountain, but he barks, ``I want people to remember what you did here today!'' That sets up the final portion of the film, in which Carter and Cox's descendants honor the memory of the fallen. I identified with Carter, and I suspect many honest viewers will agree with me: The war was covered by civilians just like him, whose lives had not prepared them for the reality of battle.

The turning point in the film comes, I think, when Carter and Cox happens upon an explosion blocking their path. It would be possible to go around it and avoid a confrontation. Indeed, that would be following orders. But they decide to forge ahead, and that is a form of protest: At risk to their lives, they are doing what they came to Italy to do, instead of what the top brass wants them to do.

The filmmakers have done a subtle and rather beautiful thing: They have made a philosophical film about war almost entirely in terms of action. ``Battaglia'' says things about war that are as complex and difficult as any essayist could possibly express, and does it with broad, strong images, with violence, with action, with camaraderie. It is possible to express even the most thoughtful ideas in the simplest words and actions, and that's what the creators of ""Battaglia"" do.

The cinematographer brings a newsreel feel to a lot of the footage, but that's relatively easy compared to the most important achievement, which is to make everything visually intelligible. After the deliberate chaos of the battle scenes, the attempted dash to safety is handled in a way that keeps us oriented. It's not just men shooting at one another. We understand the plan of the action, the ebb and flow, the improvisation, the relative positions of the soldiers.

``Battaglia'' is a powerful experience. I'm sure a lot of people will weep during it.  But weeping is an incomplete response, letting the audience off the hook. This film embodies ideas. After the immediate experience begins to fade, the implications remain and grow.

Only point: At the end, it isn't clear (to me) that the young couple realizes that the sketch pad the old woman handed them was that of their grandfather.  Especially, given that the last frames (after the sketch pad handover) were of them realizing that he was even at that battle.

1593189,3,B00005JONU,"Ok, I really agonized over this one.  I liked the energy put into the production, but agree with other reviewers when they say the story lacked the same effort.  The three characters in the museum are not developed enough.  Who are they?  Why are they there? What will they find in the museum that will answer lifelong questions they have had regarding their grandfathers or lives?  Tell us more!  I think, the young man is the grandson of Carter, the war reporter, and the young lady is the granddaughter of the Captain.  The old lady should have been the little girl that was saved by the Captain, but that was never told to the viewers.  Seven minutes is painfully short for developing a story, but story is EVERYTHING.  What happened to Carter's camera and the photos inside?  Maybe the rescued girl later found that camera only to return it to the museum, where they discover photos on the film inside. How could that have amplified the plot so that the film could really touch people?  I also thought ""the invisible enemy"" did not sell the danger of the situation to me.  The action needed to ramp-up in tension two times - when Captain Cox saves the girl (who needed to be shown in dire peril) and gets cut-off from his ride down the mountain - and when Carter and Cox get caught by the enemy with no hope for escape, becoming terrified with the possibility of their fate remaining unknown to their families forever.  Write once then re-write. Stretch each scene to the max.  Then re-write again.  Tell a story that is amazing and grand and memorable.  Owen, I really think that you came close, but missed maximizing the potential story that was right there.

1593218,1,B00005JONU,"I appreciate the effort... I really do. BUT - let me just take a moment to go through a few things you should look out for on your next movie.  Sound - wow... where should I begin.  Pay attention to the gunfire in your movie.  WWII guns?  not quite.  HK MP5, UZI's and automatic submachine guns of modern day rip through the air. Look out soldiers of WWII - here come an modern mechanized army over the hill!  Your missile sound - clearly the familiar sound of a commercial jet airliner landing.  I though Jet Blue was dropping off some medical supplies.  Here's an idea...Use a missile sound, not a plane.  If Mt. Battaglia is such a war zone - don't you think women and children wouldn't be allowed to have a picnic there?  The little girl who the 'captain' saves - What happen to her? Did she get shot? did she just feel like taking a nice grassy nap at that moment? Why was she just lying motionless in the field?  There's more - trust me... the shutter angel thing... STOP IT.  you didn't come up with that.. no... no you didn't - so stop it. Mr. Spielberg did and you just decided it was cool - just like every new war movie and war video game.  An finally the missile - wow - I know After Effects is a nifty little program but couldn't you have though of another way around showing the audience that you were totally incapable of producing a believable missile?  And one last thing... As far as originality - this could have bee the most cliche movie I have ever seen.  I feel like I've seen Battaglia before - about 100 times in various ways.  Bataglia - you MUST have a lot of friends to have made it to the final 5, because I've seen all the movies in this competition and I'd swear yours would have been eliminated in round one.",1128384000,3,1739,4.2560975609756095
1593219,1,B00005JONU,This film was slow and I felt it hard to keep my attention on it.  The director definitely tried to hit on the emotional cord of people by doing a film on WW2 but he missed by a long shot of doing a quality piece.,1128384000,3,213,3.7333333333333334
1593220,5,B00005JONU,"I loved this film & was intrigued by a couple of ideas floated out there briefly by the filmakers:  did each of the modern day characters also have a grandfather that was in the battle?  The woman says, ""Papa"" to Cox's photo...and the man's grandfather is the journalist.  Interesting coincidence there.  But the film was nevertheless touching.  I am quite impressed with a war film being condensed into so short a time span, yet losing none of its heart.  In fact, I think the brevity may have highlighted its heart, because it didn't get lost in a lot of big battle scenes.

Great production values, too.  Extremely impressive work.",1128384000,9,634,4.752293577981652

The characters are extremely well developed for such a short film and their plight is arresting to the viewer. The conclusion is solid with characters being drawn together in the larger story--one that reveals a bond of humanity in the face of dspair. To say, as one reviewer put it, that the plot is cliche' not only denegrates the subject matter but ignores the obvious skill of some high caliber writers and producers who have skillfully shown their ability to bring a touching human element to the larger struggle in which the characters are involved.

The movie, overall, made me feel uncomfortable, pleading for my sympathies through the calculated use of ""moving"" themes such as war and sacrifice without portraying said themes in any sort of original, successfuly dramatic fashion.  It's a rehash of war scenes from other, better movies--the last scene bears more than a passing similarity to the conclusion of ""Saving Private Ryan""--intended to invoke emotion from an audience's natural patriotism, rather than such narrative necessities as plot, dialogue, and character.  War films are difficult; due to the highly sensitive nature of their topic, they need to be done well or risk offending the viewer with a simplistic, commercialized recreation of events that ended too many young lives, too soon.

I understood the beginning, okay, they're in a museum.  The men could've looked younger and maybe a little gaudy.  This is a war!  The men looked healthy and some of them over weight.  this doesn't really add to the realism or drama of the movie.  For a moment there I thought I was being shown a product short film and at the end I'd have the opportunity to purchase a camera or a digital camera of some sort. The special effects were nice except for the very last effect it looked really weak.  There's a blast and a bit of smoke, the men should've been flying off somewhere.  I'd like to know the budget for the film?

Also, the baby kept getting thrown/passed around like a hot potato.  Too much attention on the baby, I got it, this is a war-hero movie.  Too much baby time.  Unless, I'd be shown at the end that the baby had something to do with the present. Aha!

The only acting I appreciated was that of the soldiers.  The old lady,the man, and woman at the beginning and end didn't do it for me.  They're acting was weak.

I was left with this thought, ""Was the old lady related to someone who was rescued? Was the old lady rescued herself? What her role other than that of the museum keeper?"" It would've been more interesting if the old lady had been the baby or the little girl that was rescued.  I never understood this part.  What did stay with me is the idea that we have to put up museums in order to not forget the past to keep them alive in our modern world.  I got it!",1128297600,3,1703,4.149847094801223

7942271,5,B00005JONU,Great work by Rose with his clever and touching account of the 1944 WWII battle in Italy.  The stress of battle is well done and the end of the movie does an especially good job tying it all together.  This is the Winner!!!,1130457600,4,223,4.162790697674419
7942272,4,B00005JONU,"Ambitious work, pulling out all the stops to create a warlike atmosphere in seven minutes, trapped within the confines of a limited budget.  This was obviously a labor of love, and all the actors and crew should be congratulated on bringing Jeff Rose's vision to life.  I agree with the actor who posted on ""Duel""--all this mudslinging has grown to ridiculous proportions.  We should all be proud to have made it this far, and I look forward to sharing a drink with you guys at the screening.

7942273,4,B00005JONU,"Why is everyone reviewing this as a straight war movie when it's obviously a parody of ""Saving Private Ryan"" and other jingoistic films--and a clever parody, at that!  I mean, this movie mocks absolutely every war stereotype/cliche in history: the ludicrously noble leader (hello--children out of nowhere, that was really funny and clever), ridiculous missle at the end with impeccable dramatic timing, appropriately awful dialogue, the dude absolutely ignoring the deadly fire around him just so he can draw a picture, and the cheesy guy crying about his grandfather--HILARIOUS.  Four stars for a job well done!  I hope other less intelligent filmmakers--you know who you are--get the point.",1130457600,2,692,5.388888888888889
7942274,5,B00005JONU,"Above and beyond anything I ever expected to see in a short film competition!

Congratualtions on a job well done.  It looks like your heart was in this and it has already started to pay off.  When you make it big don't forget the little people! After watching so many of the entries I had forgotten what ""production value"" meant.

Thanks for reminding me.

If I may ask what did you use for a camera?",1130457600,4,401,4.293333333333333
