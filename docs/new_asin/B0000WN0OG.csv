1958072,5,B0000WN0OG,"My daughter absolutely LOVES Maisy and this DVD is a huge hit with her.  She would have it playing all day if I would let her.  It teaches numbers, colors, and shapes and has some cute songs spread throughout.  I do agree that having to fast forward through the previews in the beginning is a bit annoying, but it is well worth it to hear my little one sing the Maisy theme and dance.",1087862400,,384,4.162162162162162
1958073,5,B0000WN0OG,Good morning Maisy is really good for kids learning to speak. My son is 2 years old and he is starting to speak - Good Morning Maisy combines fun and language learning - giving him the simple concepts such as numbers. It is highly recommended for any one with kids starting to learn words.,1289260800,,289,4.37037037037037
1958074,5,B0000WN0OG,"Our toddlers love Maisy, and we got them this DVD for Easter 2010. It has many episodes in it, and they are all very educational with repetitive counting, ABC's and word recognition. All the songs are fun and catchy too! I highly recommend this DVD.",1277596800,,249,4.555555555555555
1958075,5,B0000WN0OG,"My 18-month old became a Maisy fan when she was less than a year old.  Then the show was no longer available where we live so she has had to watch the same two episodes we had TIVO'd for about six months.  Santa brought this Maisy video and it has been a hit!  Both she and my five-year old enjoy it, and sometimes it is the only thing that will relax my 18 month old and settle her down.  This has been a great addition to our home.  Thanks Santa!",1232409600,,448,3.933333333333333
1958076,5,B0000WN0OG,"We love Maisy above other cartoons because it has great picture - not too detailed or elaborate - easy to follow for our baby.  Bright colors and chunky black outlines.  This DVD offers learning facets too with the number and letters portions.  Love the long length and variety of the film. As an elementary teacher, I have to critique the way that they taught the ""R"" sound, sounding it out ""ruh"" instead of ""errrr"" - ""errrr"" is noticed the same w/ a couple other letters, but all in all, I don't think the proper way to teach the R sound in my school's phonics curriculum.  I it makes a huge difference and won't scar your baby's phonics abilities later in life!",1231459200,,664,4.462809917355372
1958077,3,B0000WN0OG,"Play Time with Maisy basically lives in our DVD player, and has become a real morning ritual in our house -- and at this point, I have just about every frame memorized.  Even though my toddler is happy to see it over and over again, I was looking for a little variety when I bought Good Morning Maisy -- but this collection doesn't keep to the same format.  There's one ""episode"" that follows the normal pattern of intro/story/song/story/song/story/song/story, but the rest of the DVD has two alternate format episodes (and be aware, the ABC's episode really is 1/2 hour of the alphabet, which is very, very hard on the attention span of the target audience) and one cobbled-together set of stories that are poorly edited together such that you see the intro a few different times in odd places and the credits run in the middle and the songs are missing, etc.  Also, n.b., the Farm stories have the British narration, which is not only a different voice, but a different pace, pronunciation and vocabulary, which can be slightly disorienting.

So:  even though we LOOOOOOVE Maisy, and will happily watch her do pretty much anything, I have to say I'm annoyed with the editing on this particular collection.",1227312000,3,1207,4.783653846153846
1958078,5,B0000WN0OG,"Before this DVD my two-year old would never watch any T.V.  After watching this DVD he knows more letter, numbers, colors, and animals than before.  He loves watching them over and over again.  A lot more than Thomas the Train.",1211932800,,227,4.625

1958080,5,B0000WN0OG,"We have a one and a half year-old son who loves Maisy! This was his favourite Christmas present this year. He loves choosing which episode to watch, and I love it that they are all so educational. He has learned more and more about the alphabet, counting, and the farm, among other things. I also love that this series is so completely free from violence and negative characters. All of the characters are friends who help and forgive each other readily. There was some advertising on the dvd before you get to the main menu, but after the initial watch, you can fast forward through them in just a few seconds. Way to go Maisy!",1200009600,,628,4.469565217391304
1958081,5,B0000WN0OG,"My son enjoyed watching Maisy on Noggin so much that we recorded a number of episodes using our DVR. Inevitably I needed to save room on our DVR drive and decided to delete the episodes, so I bought ""Good Morning Maisy"" hoping he would enjoy it as much as he had the Noggin episodes. I was very excited to receive ""Good Morning Maisy"". I was even more excited after we started watching. Much of the content was new to us - I don't think Noggin includes the loveable songs after every episode - and is wonderful. Maisy and her friends are not obnoxious, the colors are stimulating, and I can't find anything to dislike - I love it.",1190937600,,630,4.3474576271186445

1958084,2,B0000WN0OG,"We like the ""Maisy"" books -- good, simple, colorful stories, not a lot of intellectual heft.  But good golly, these animated shorts are just terrible!!!  The narrator sounds completely bored (and secretly contemptuous of the material) and the character voices consist mainly of moronic giggle-babbles that sound a lot like the TeleTubbies.  It's really insulting to the intelligence of even the youngest viewers.  Plus, the age group that this is suited to developmentally (one-year olds) shouldn't be watching videos anyway: recent studies suggest that watching TV -- any kind of TV -- in the first two years of life holds back language development and shortens attention span.  This video is not worth the risk. (Axton)",1186444800,,721,5.234782608695652

1958086,5,B0000WN0OG,I thought this is age appropriate.  It tells the letters and does some counting.  We are very happy with the dvd.,1169078400,,113,4.333333333333333
1958087,5,B0000WN0OG,"My son brings the Maisy books and DVDs to me to read or play. He walks over to me and says ""MAISY"". He loves Maisy so much that it makes me personally sad when I have to turn it off. What I love about Maisy is that the characters are so innocent and playful. Maisy shows examples of sharing, caring, patience, logic, and more. It is very educational. There is one segment where Maisy drives a train carrying animals. My son counts along as Maisy stops to pick up a new set of animals.  It is great and enjoyable.  If you are looking for a refreshing break away from the stuff on TV, Maisy is it. And, if you have Maisy books and the DVD your children will learn so much from Maisy.",1168387200,,681,4.112781954887218
1958088,1,B0000WN0OG,"The movie had so many ad's at the beginning, that you can't skip through, that my child was bored before the movie started.",1166572800,2,123,4.391304347826087
1958089,5,B0000WN0OG,"My 19 month old daughter LOVES Maisy mouse.  The Good Morning Maisy DVD has 4 episodes: Count with Maisy (30 minutes), Maisy's ABCs (34 minutes), Maisy's Colors and Shapes (28 minutes) and Maisy's Farm (54 minutes).

Count with Maisy has 5 segments (5 min each) in which Maisy is counting something.  The topic of each segment is: Train, Bus, Harvest, Fleas, Hide & Seek.  Between each segement is a short song.

Maisy's ABCs is not broken into mini segments.  Maisy and her friends try to find things that begin with each letter of the alphabet, with lots of help from the narrator.  Although ABCs are a little old for my daughter, she stays entertained and likes watching this episode.

Maisy's Colors and Shapes is 5 segments: Balloons, Spots, Shed, Circus, Plane.  There are no songs between the segments.  I've been disappointed by this episode.  It seems that there were technical difficulties when they produced it.  The opening plays twice in a row.  After the Circus segment the credits roll, and then there is the final segment ""Plane.""  I also don't think that most of the segments go with the title of ""colors and shapes.""  None of this bothers my daughter, but I find it annoying.

Maisy's Farm is my favorite, as well as my daughter's.  The first 20 minutes is all one long segment of Maisy on a farm, planting seeds and taking care of the animals.  She goes through the 4 seasons and you see how the animals and the land changes.  I find it interesting that the narrator's voice is different for this segment, and he uses terms occasionally that are more British.  Following this are 7 of the regular 5 min segments: Duckling, Breakfast, Toot toot, Shopping, Bugs, and Mountain.  I'm not really sure how most of them relate to Maisy's ""Farm,"" but they are all cute.  The episode finishes with the song ""Maisy, Maisy had a Farm.""  (Like Old MacDonald).",1151971200,31,1866,4.691358024691358
1958090,5,B0000WN0OG,"This Maisy DVD was an instant hit with my two year old.

It has some good topics covered too including numbers,ABC, Maisy's farm,and Colours.

The ABC section is good as it shows Lower and Upper case letters and says the letter phonetically too.

Perfect for little ones and one of the better things they can watch if they have to watch TV.",1142726400,,340,4.451612903225806

1958092,5,B0000WN0OG,"Maisy is as favorite in our home with our two tots under aged three.  They love the music, which is not annoying and does not grate on adults' nerves, the short clips are very helpful in teaching colors, shapes, numbers and daily activities.  The characters are playful and memorable so each time we watch it our kids call out the answers to various questions and seem to be learning quickly.  You definitely get your money's worth as this DVD is quite lengthy.  The Maisy series of books is also nice and we've collected a few of the plush as well.  Makes a fun and different set for childhood as an alternate or addition to the classics like Sesame Street and Winnie the Pooh.",1130284800,3,678,4.479674796747967

The colorful images and music hold tremendous appeal for my 3-year-old and with 4 full-length shows on the DVD, it is a great value.  I also like the fact that Maisy and her friends always have a can-do attitude and teach toddlers a few good lessons along the way.  My only complaint is that I wish a breakdown of the individual segments was listed so that I know which episode contains the segment my child insists on watching that day!",1129852800,,485,4.426966292134831

1958095,4,B0000WN0OG,"Well, at least she does for my 3 and a half year old daughter.  Each episode is compact with a simple theme covering the whole educational gambet.  Beware, the theme song may start to make adults twitch after a while.  The DVD has a different narrator than the original (Neal Morrissey) videos, but all in all a good viewing for the under 5s.",1129161600,,342,4.396825396825397
1958096,4,B0000WN0OG,"My 2.5 yr old daughter just discovered Maisy and just loves this DVD. I don't mind putting on the Maisy's ABCs part because it does take time with each letter. I also like that each compact episode is like 20-40 minutes so I can easily tell my daughter it is ""over"" and turn it off rather than watch the 2 hours plus. The way I bypass the previews is my remote has two ways to advance - one to skip to the next scene/track which I agree does not work. But I have an option to fast forward while the screen is on and that gets me through the previews to the menu.",1128211200,,562,3.982300884955752

This ticks me off.  I don't like having my daughter forcefed ads!  I tend to keep the set off or at least on mute till they are done.  If anyone has found a way to get past them, I'd love to know.  I see one other reviewer has the same problem.  Other than that it is a great video.",1127001600,,441,3.8444444444444446

1958099,4,B0000WN0OG,"My daughter likes Maisy, but the DVD annoyingly forces you to watch 10 minutes of advertisements before you can start to watch the show!

1958101,3,B0000WN0OG,"I bought this DVD for my son because we had one Maisy episode on VHS that he absolutely adored: Maisy's Colors & Shapes. I wanted to ""upgrade"" to the DVD format but also to have new espisodes for him to watch. He loves all the new episodes--and I'll admit, I do to! But the DVD has some big editing problems. Those of you who are regular Maisy watchers know that most episodes include several short stories with songs in between. When they recorded the Colors & Shapes episode onto the DVD, they left out all the songs that went with that episode! These include ""Up up up the hill,"" ""Can you hop like a frog can?"" and ""The Wheels on the Bus."" (Maybe one more, too, I don't remember!) My son and I both love the songs and miss them. Sadly, we gave away the VHS tape before we even watched ""Colors & Shapes"" on the DVD. Universal really messed that one up! That, with the annoyingly compulsive trailers, makes me not think too highly of them. I'm not sure I'll buy another Maisy DVD in case they have the same problem with the missing songs.",1097193600,24,1039,4.3061224489795915
1958102,4,B0000WN0OG,"My now 18 month old daughter loves this video! It teaches her the alphabets and numbers. They go over each letter of the alphabet with examples such as A for apple, B for balloons and so on. We have a 52in. TV and the letters are big enough that it takes up the whole screen.  As far as counting numbers, they count from 1-10 which is perfect for any kid as early as 6 months or even younger.

Our daughter also loves the music such as the song Maisy had a farm  instead of Old McDonald had a farm.  She dances to the music.

One drawback is the fact that you can't skip the trailers in the beginning of the movie. The only way to avoid watching it is fast forwarding it to the menu like the old VHS.  Hope they will fix that with the newer movies.  You have to hold on to the fast forward in order to bypass all the stupid trailers.

Overall, it is a great movie.",1096502400,3,864,4.011695906432749
