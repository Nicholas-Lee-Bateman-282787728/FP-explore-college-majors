The story of Sam Houston is truly fascinating, and Richard Dix's performance is nuanced and powerful. I have thoroughly enjoyed this film in an earlier version, but I bought this blu-ray hoping that the picture would be even clearer and the print more complete than what I had seen earlier.  What I received was a print so dark that only by turning out all the other light in the room was it even marginally visible. If this is the version all buyers will receive, they'll be mightily disappointed..",1490313600,2,605,4.5504587155963305

8717444,5,B00Y250I38,"There have been only a few movies specifically about Sam Houston - usually he is a side character in many Alamo movies.  The three movies available: THE FIRST TEXAN with Joel McCrea; HOUSTON: LEGEND OF TEXAS (aka Gone to Texas) with Sam Elliott; and now just released MAN OF CONQUEST with Richard Dix which I think is the best of the three.  I am glad they released it in Blue-Ray and for a movie 76 years old it is excellent quality.  The story is fairly accurate considering the liberties Hollywood always takes with bio-pics.  Best of all is Richard Dix's powerful screen performance - he fills the role perfectly.  The movie starts before he became Governor of Tennessee and doesn't just stop with his victory at San Jacinto, but spends some time on his role in the rest of Texas history up to the civil war. Very enjoyable film.",1440374400,3,833,4.563758389261745
