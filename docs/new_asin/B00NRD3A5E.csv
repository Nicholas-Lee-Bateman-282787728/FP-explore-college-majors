8679867,5,B00NRD3A5E,"I have had the COSI FAN TUTTE from Zurich on double DVD for many years, and had to learn to like it, because the schoolroom conceit was a little hard for me to take. Also I did not warm to Sacc, whom I had found a bit stiff in earlier productions. Over the years, the schoolroom looks pretty sedate by comparison with the madhouses prevailing on many stages today, and Sacc has proven himself time and again as an adaptable singer. I was hesitant to buy the blu-ray, because of not expecting two operas on one disc to have superior sound or picture. In the end my curiosity got the better of me, and I invested in the blu-ray. I am happy to report that the COSI constitutes a big improvement over the DVD. The sound is mixed better, and comes across more musically. Had the program arrived ten years ago in this condition, I would have warmed to it immediately. I could not compare the DON GIOVANNI, not having ever owned the DVD, but one must assume that since that performance was only a year later than the COSI, the master tapes must have been in about the same condition, and subjected to the same remastering would yield a similar revelation of sound quality. So I am confident heartily to recommend this double bill of Mozart conducted by Harnoncourt in Zurich.",1422835200,3,1268,4.469827586206897
