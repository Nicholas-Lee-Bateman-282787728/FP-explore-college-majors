8137479,5,B000H7WPQI,Great interactive dvd. It is one of the better ones out there. Makes it far more interesting when you have to make decisions where to go.,1363219200,2,137,4.3076923076923075
8137480,4,B000H7WPQI,"I studied Chinese language 2.5 years at San Francisco City College and lived in its and Houston's Chinatowns 22 years, and my current girl Si-Qi is Chinese, so I love ""Jung Gwok Neui"", and Felicia Tang is a very sexy one. This is one of her best movies. She has two vignettes in it, and both are sexy. Her scenes alone are worth more than the price of this movie to me. Indeed, her scenes are about the only ones I watch. It is quite sad that she was allegedly beaten and strangled to death by her lover of a few months Brian Lee Randone in 2009 (I just saw that he beat the rap, so who knows?). I just have to make do with her eight DVDs I already own. Jesse Capelli is attractive too, and so is Alexa Rae, but I think Felicia Tang is the sexiest girl by far in this DVD. I'm not wild about the gimmicks in it, but I can find Felicia's scenes easily enough by two methods. Bellboy Lance Vance can leave as far as I'm concerned. He's creepy!",1326326400,4,941,4.064516129032258
8137481,1,B000H7WPQI,I could not get this DVD to perform according to the movie.  I would click on a option and nothing would happen.  Save your money......,1281916800,,135,4.36
