7970942,5,B00006L50L,I'm using this tape to get back in shape.  It's been years since I did a regular step workout.  The first couple of times were pretty challenging because I got confused on the footwork.  But after 3 or 4 times I'm really getting into it.  Today I couldn't believe the tape was over already.  I wanted more!  This tape is proving for me to be a good way to get back in shape.  I love it!,1093392000,,386,4.0

For reference, this workout is less difficult than Chrisi Taylor's choregoraphy.  By rewinding at the parts I couldn't do the first time, I finally learned it and had a blast - I felt like I was dancing, not doing another boring step workout.
The workout itself medium intensity - you'll sweat, but you won't be huffing/puffing (well, maybe you will, it depends on your fitness level really).
Kari is my new fave instructor - great cues, engaging and motivating personality.  I also loved the music - none of that canned techno-y stuff.",1052179200,6,643,4.889908256880734
