6599333,5,B00MPJJ8B6,"To be honest, i saw the series on our television in Israel and I loved it so much, that I ordered the series on DVD to be sent to my sister in Melbourne,  Australia. My sister is even a greater animal lover than me and I know she'll love it as much as I did. As far as I know, she hasn't received yet, I hope it arrives at her door soon!",1442016000,2,337,3.6805555555555554

6599335,5,B00MPJJ8B6,Wonderful show based on the real family behind Chester Zoo with an excellent cast. I wish there would be more season of this show. I was sad when I heard that this good family show was cancelled. There should more good family shows on in the United States and in Europe.,1438128000,5,270,4.313725490196078
6599336,5,B00MPJJ8B6,"My whole family loved this drama. What an amazing story! I'm not a fan of all zoos but Chester Zoo is wonderful and today does so much for conservation. It's the most popular zoo in the UK. The series tells the true story of George Mottershead and his family's struggle to start Chester Zoo in a small English village called Upton near Chester. George wanted to create a zoo where animals would be happy, well cared for and treated as part of the extended family. He hated seeing animals mistreated and behind bars. At the beginning of the story, he ends up with a monkey, parrot and a camel which were going to be put down and realises he needs to get somewhere to house them as the terraced house the family are living in won't do!  It's heartwarming, filled with humour but also is gripping and sometime tear jerking stuff. Loved the characters, setting and the period - the 1930s.",1422662400,8,884,4.490683229813665
6599337,5,B00MPJJ8B6,"I highly recommend this charming and quirky family drama based on an inspiring true story set in Britain in the 1930s, It's about an eccentric working class family, who were prepared to take huge risks and start a zoo without bars despite opposition. The zoo was innovative Chester Zoo, which greatly helped improve the way animals were kept in captivity. Today its a charity, the UKs number one zoo (Trip Adviser) as well as the biggest tourist attraction outside London. Its focus today is to help in the conservation of endangered species and education.

The story is narrated by the youngest daughter June, whose closest friends were the animals.",1422662400,6,650,4.963302752293578

8673825,5,B00MPJJ8B6,"Coming to this series after seeing several low-budget, independent, ""small"" American movies that received critical acclaim among the theatrical releases of 2016, I was initially impressed by the sheer professionalism of the cinematography, the editing, the lighting, the attention to ""period detail"" of this British television series.  Actors usually have lots of ""inside"" jokes about the difficulty of playing opposite animals and children.  The makers of ""Our Zoo"" have averted such distractions by recognizing that their movie about George Motterhead's realization of his dream of a zoo-without-cages is as much about setting and context as story and plot.

While viewing this series, my mind frequently left the ostensible, surface story to underlying meanings that, at least for some of us as ""adult viewers,"" are inescapable in a film that can be alternately light and dark, humorous and serious, ""specific"" to time and place but also ""universal"" in what it tells us about our humanity and the life we share with all other living beings.  Rather than devote this review to the film's delightful, well-acted surface narrative (suitable for the family), I'll address the substratum that, along with the time period and place, serves as a fertile, idea-rich foundation for the top-level story, suggesting far more than we have a right to expect from the usual zoo story (e.g. ""We Bought a Zoo"" with Matt Damon and Scarlett Johansson).

""Our Zoo"" will remind some of us (who have heard stories about our grandparents' times or read about the cultural shift between the ""Victorian Age"" and ""Modernism"") that the animals in zoos have often come from distant lands, then been maltreated during shipment in small crates, and finally sold to the highest bidder in the Western world.  In fact, these animals, at least to begin with, likely had a survival rate not much higher than that of the young soldiers who engaged with the enemy in the first World War of the 20th century.  Fifty years after the horse-drawn wagons, manual weaponry, and menacing cannonballs of America's Civil War came the most merciless, dehumanizing war in history--the first major international conflict employing the inventions of ""modern"" industry and technology--including self-powered killing machines--and not just tanks on the ground and battle ships on the seas but OVERHEAD--the first airplanes, equipped to destroy other flying war machines and to kill below as well as above; plus high-powered repeating rifles and artillery with unprecedented accuracy and fire-power; finally, as if the traditional ""rules of engagement"" no longer applied in this one-sided confrontation between machinery and human flesh, was the absence of restrictions on the use of chemicals--most of them lethal, some  more painful and disfiguring than others.

The shock was greater in Britain than in the States. The lucky survivors of the war returned with scars deeper than those of veterans of earlier wars.  One of those survivors was George Motterhead, whose  memory of an unshakable nightmare serves two primary purposes in the telling of his story: 1. it helps the viewer understand a conflict between the impulsive, even occasionally wild and irresponsible, behavior of George and the disapproval of his behavior by a formal British society, still clinging to the values, propriety and customs of late-Victorian England;  2. these same experiences and images from the first World War, besides serving as ""symptomatic"" of the divide between the surviving soldiers and the old ""established"" culture, are also ""causative"": they help us understand WHY George is driven to build his own zoo. (And his reason may go beyond the motives of any member of PETA.  It's not merely the animals in the zoo but his own wounded psyche that requires healing.)

The cruelty that others have inflicted upon these wild animals is one of the injustices George wishes to address with his new zoo.  But having experienced the heartless, ""unnatural,"" machinery of modern warfare, George is representative of the vets who find some consolation--even a sense of ""wholeness"" --not in social customs or organized religion but in nature.  Moreover, as beings that have suffered injury and mutilation, loss and separation, imprisonment and punishment for ""misbehavior,"" the animals that occupy George bear no little resemblance to the comrades George remembers from a war that was the most unheroic, inhumane and ""unnatural"" of all conflicts.  And he finds no comfort in meeting up with other returning vets, many of whom suffer from external, visible scars and mutilations.

The foregoing is not meant to imply that ""Our Zoo"" is an explicit indictment of modern warfare or a manifesto of modernist art.  The explicit story of the zoo is suitable for children--with some of the familiar themes and conflicts of a Disney movie.  But to the alert, adult viewer, the film ""implies"" much more than we see on its surfaces (which are not the saturated iridescent colors of escapist entertainments but more muted tones, leaving room for the thoughtful symbolic meanings normally reserved for black and white movies).

It's regrettable that the BBC, perhaps with pressures from other sponsors, decided to pull the plug on this potentially explosive and profound dramatic series.  It tells the story not only of a remarkable visionary and his zoo (which becomes ""ours"" in the course of the story): it documents a war that we tend to  neglect--or, worse, glorify--to the peril of us all.  ""Our Zoo"" is a reminder of who we were a hundred years ago--and still are--less than a century later.

P.S. Aware of the Regional problems with this DVD, which is encoded for European viewers, I found the episodes available for streaming on a few select American sites.  Try: Dailymotion.com",1494374400,3,5804,5.220667384284177
