8304219,5,B001G7CTLO,"So, as you can see I was one of the directors of this video. I haven't picked this dvd up in some time and recently decided to change my Yoga routine up a bit. I put YD in the DVD drive and it completely kicked my rear end. Now that I've had some time away from it I can finally appreciate it as a consumer. A lot of care went into making this and it shows. Two very thorough and complete programs.",1424131200,,398,3.8658536585365852
8304220,5,B001G7CTLO,"I used to practice yoga with Lara Falberg and she was one of the best yoga instructors I've ever had. So when she moved away from my city, buying this DVD was a no-brainer. I have tried a few other yoga dvds and found them lacking: either the workout was too short, or too dumbed-down for someone who has been doing yoga for years. This is the closest I've found to actually taking a real yoga class. Lara has a great sense of humor that comes across in the DVD without being distracting, and her workout is definitely easier but still very satisfying. Nicole's is a little more intense and advanced, but she offers modification (as does Lara) so that you can choose whether you want a deeper stretch or more intense experience. In both cases, their instructions are so good that I didn't even have to look at the screen (if you're new to yoga, this likely won't be the case), and their tips on adjusting your positions were so good that I almost felt like they were able to see me!

If you like yoga videos where the instructor is on a beach in Hawaii or in a tropical wonderland, this is NOT for you - it's rather bare-bones, and the segments are filmed in an actual yoga studio. But I actually found myself preferring the austere setting.

If Nicole and Lara made a YogaDose 2 DVD, I'd buy it in a heartbeat (hint, hint, ladies!).",1360022400,,1333,4.370967741935484
8304221,5,B001G7CTLO,I really liked this DVD's style.  Very good instruction and loved having 2 very different classes with 2 great instructors.  Doesn't get old at all either!  Great for beginners or advanced level yoga.,1265587200,,200,5.0
8304222,5,B001G7CTLO,"I would recommend this DVD to anyone.  I am a beginner, and was not at all intimidated (as I thought i might be) because the instructors are so down to earth.  I couldn't disagree more with the reviewer who said that the classes were too similar to one another.  I really felt that the entire DVD felt ""fresh"" and that it was a real plus to have two different instructors/classes so that you don't get tired of it.  Give it a shot - I think you'll love it as much as I do!",1265587200,,472,4.043010752688172
8304223,1,B001G7CTLO,"I have been doing yoga regularly for 5 years and was looking for something a little varied from the usual hatha yoga workout. I enjoyed Lara's segment especially her use of the wall to enhance understanding of alignment.
The problem was that Lara's segment was the only one on the DVD. Nichole's segment was just a repeat of Lara's. It's too bad that a quality check wasn't done before the DVD was sent out to customers.",1245974400,,420,4.5394736842105265
8304224,5,B001G7CTLO,"I really love this DVD. I usually do Nicole's class but they are both so great because they start out slow and relaxing and little by little you realize you are sweating and working really hard! I especially like Nicole because she explains every pose so well, not just how to do it but why to do it and what it might make you feel and think. I often find in yoga studio classes that they are either super ""athletic"" or super spiritual. But I like that Nicole clearly makes a spiritual and thoughtful practice possible and yet also conducts a class that anyone could do without thinking about anything other than their own serenity and work (of course, that's an important part of yoga practice too!). I am also impressed that they made such a great effort with the music and production values...you can tell a lot of people cared about making this a really good experience that you can do again and again, and they succeeded!",1229990400,,926,4.517857142857143
8304225,5,B001G7CTLO,"I'm -really- new to the yoga scene, thought that I'd give this DVD a try as a friend said it was really good. Turns out not only have I been using it lot, my wife (who has more yoga experience) has been joining me. Very good DVD, but not as stuffy as I was expecting a yoga DVD to be.

Well done DVD, recommended for sure.",1228608000,,322,3.878787878787879
8304226,5,B001G7CTLO,"This dvd is great for beginners...I have always been interested in Yoga, but a little too insecure to attend a class. Lara and Nicole make it fun to both learn and get a great work-out. I also have a knee injury, and I can already see the difference it has made in my flexibility and balance. Not only is it great source of exercise, it's a great source of relaxation too. I'm going to buy a few as Xmas gifts!",1228089600,,410,4.1375
8304227,5,B001G7CTLO,"Great DVD. I love that there are two super different routines- I never get bored. I find both instructors' sessions to be very relaxing but still quite challenging at the same time (my waist is always a little sore the next day!). There are modifications for most of the poses so I can decide how hard to push myself. The pacing is just about perfect (slow enough to get my form right and really feel the stretch but quick enough to where I feel like we are really flowing smoothly through the moves), and there's definitely a strong focus on proper breathing and keeping your core engaged. Also, Lara and Nicole explain the poses so well that I feel like they're right in my living room helping me (sorry they have to look at me in such tight pants!). Overall, it's money well spent. I'm extremely pleased with this purchase and look forward to the next Yoga Dose DVD!",1228089600,,869,4.471698113207547
8304228,5,B001G7CTLO,"I do the DVD every other day and I switch off between the two segments (Lara and Nicole). The two classes are completely different and I never get bored. I've actually never done and at-home workout DVD because I find it really hard to concentrate on my own--but this one keeps me engaged because I feel like I'm right there in the class. Both instructors break down all the postures so it's easy to follow along and they go slow enough so that I can follow, but fast enough so that I'm challenged. I would recommend this for ppl at any level because you can really tailor/modify the program to your needs. Overall, I LOVE IT!",1228089600,,626,4.405172413793103
