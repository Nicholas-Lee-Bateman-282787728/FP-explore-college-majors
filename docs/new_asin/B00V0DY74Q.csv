7076173,5,B00V0DY74Q,"Powerful, with the Crush of the day, James Norton. This is a Classic, which I had seen before, but This one is superb.",1466208000,2,118,4.173913043478261
7076174,2,B00V0DY74Q,"I bought it because they said ""All regions""  but I could not watch it.
There was the sound (very nice) and images of menu botton on TV screen.
I'm very sad but I can enjoy it as a good photograph frame in Japan.",1464912000,,211,3.9069767441860463
7076175,5,B00V0DY74Q,"I never saw any other version of this movie, so I have nothing to compare it to......but I thoroughly enjoyed this. Holiday Grainger was superb!",1462752000,,144,4.8
7076176,1,B00V0DY74Q,"Terrible adaptation of the book. Out of a prudent cowardice the writer has crushed all of Lawrence's ""problematic"" thematic content and left developed only class conflict, which has itself been horribly altered into the mere expression of petty contempt vs bare resentment. It doesn't even make the usual mistake of thinking Lawrence was writing lite pornography, since the sexual content is leveled-out and made to hide behind a rose colored screen.",1460592000,3,450,5.352112676056338
7076177,5,B00V0DY74Q,Wonderful!,1454716800,3,10,10.0

8708899,5,B00V0DY74Q,Well done.,1533600000,,10,4.5
8708900,3,B00V0DY74Q,"While the movie certainly had pretty actors and even prettier costumes, the story itself left me ambivalent. I'm not sure if it was the fault of the original novel or simply this interpretation, but I didn't particularly like any of the characters. The film was certainly well meaning in it's addressing of class issues, but the message felt too heavy-handed. Some subtlety and nuance would have helped, as would more sympathetic characters.",1528243200,,441,5.138888888888889
8708901,5,B00V0DY74Q,Great take on clasic,1527724800,,20,4.25

8708905,1,B00V0DY74Q,"I purchased this as a bluray, however it does not play and my bluray player says it is an episode of Sherlock.

I have asked for a resolution and will update my review when I have additional information on how this was handled.",1486512000,,227,4.27906976744186
8708906,5,B00V0DY74Q,I love this version of Lady Chatterley's Lover. It makes more sense.  All of the actors are suburb.,1483660800,2,99,4.5
8708907,3,B00V0DY74Q,"I haven't read the book, so I'm not sure how accurate this adaptation is.  I have however, seen 2 other film adaptations and this one has much less graphic sex scenes and focused more on the emotional connection between Lady Chatterley & her lover.  Heavy on tears, light on chemistry so it was a bit of yawn for me.  Seemed like a short movie too, but maybe I'm wrong.  This disc does NOT have special features, behind the scenes & whatnot which I was very disappointed with.",1480723200,,476,4.436781609195402
