For example at the time of writing their Gothic Spirits CD range is now heading into Volume 18(!). Replicating the formula - and a lot of the material if truth be known - is the CD series Symphonic Metal - Dark and Beautiful which is currently standing at around Vol VII as well as a series under the subtitle Dark Ladies (the fourth instalment came out a short time ago) as well as a series of CD's under the banner Opera Metal which also has several releases under its belt. Each of them has a lot of the same material - hey, if you are gonna pay for that licensing you might as well use it huh?

In terms of DVD's we've not got such a rude array of ZYX releases to choose from. There are some Gothic Spirits DVD's and live DVD's with the same sort of bands. And we now have a couple of Opera Metal DVD's.

Another reviewer has gone to the trouble of writing out the whole playlist so I'll not replicate that here. What I will do is to point out that these release should only be picked up cheap if possible because much of the material you could almost certainly source for free. Also note that apart from the nice cover art from Luis Royo there is no booklet, no insight at all. Just a DVD with music videos on it.

The navigation is simplicity itself here and my copy is zone free so happy days for all those people who buy discs from overseas and then write up one star reviews because they can't play the thing.

As for the music... well personal taste is always king but for me this DVD didn't hit the mark as often as the second instalmnent. We do get a fair whack of variety. We get Dimmu Borgir doing the usual juvenile black metal waffle (interesting video for the blokes out there to watch), Nightwish, Avantasia (Klaus Meine on guest vox!), Delain, Epica, Therion, Theatre of Tragedy, Sirenia with the mentally bleak My Minds Eye, an interesting song/video combination from Opeth and the very nicely constructed Beast Within by Katra. In addition there are a range of very small time bands whose video budgets probably amounted to very little but whom it is a pleasure to have along for the ride. Romanias Magica, and the live style video for After Forevers Discord both have their own charms.

All up if you cannot easily access this stuff for free then these sorts of compilations from ZYX are probably a good buy. Don't pay too much for them and they'll give you a good range of mostly European style metal. As for what songs here really are symphonic, power or trad metal I'd leave the quibbling to those whose minds are fascinated with such things....",1413504000,2,2732,4.380670611439842
8357214,5,B0028Z35MK,"Ok, my only complaint on this compilation is the Nightwish video. Of all the Nightwish videos available, I can't believe ""The Islander"" was the video chosen! The only video Anette takes back-seat to Marco. Other than that, this is a great compilation as I own both volumes. I'm a big fan of female-fronted bands and this doesn't disappoint.
01. Nightwish - The Islander (You already know my complaint on this one, at least I can still stare at hottie Anette in the video, hahaha)
02. Edguy - Superheroes
03. Avantasia - Lost In Space
04. Delain - April Rain (My favorite song from Delain, so I was excited to see this video on here with the hot Charlotte Wessels)
05. Epica - Never Enough (A favorite from Epica, that Simone is such a hottie)
06. Therion - Son Of The Staves Of Time (My favorite song from Therion, but too bad it's just a live clip from there ""Live Gothic"" DVD, which I already owned)
07. Katra - Beast Within (Great song from the hot Katra in her debut album)
08. Sirenia - My Mind's Eye (A favorite song from the Monika Pedersen album)
09. Cradle Of Filth - Honey And Sulphur
10. Agathodaimon - Serpent's Embrace
11. Xandria - Ravenheart (A favorite song and my favorite video on here, that Lisa is so hot)
12. Mortal Love - Adoration (A female-fronted band but Catherine Nyland is not so easy on the eyes here)
13. Magica - Entangled (Always wanted to hear what Magica was all about so it was cool to see a video on here, fronted by Ana Mladinovici)
14. Theatre Of Tragedy - Storm (A great song from the Nell Sigland era)
15. After Forever - Discord (Was never a big After Forever fan, this video doesn't show front-woman Floors Jansen very well as it was shot like a concert MTV video)
16. Dimmu Borgir - Progenies Of The Great Apocalypse
17. Liv Kristine - Fake A Smile (Great video from front-woman to Leaves' Eyes)
18. Opeth - Porcelain Heart",1364947200,5,1866,4.443148688046647
