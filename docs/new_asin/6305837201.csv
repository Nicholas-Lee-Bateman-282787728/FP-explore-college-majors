I have no idea why I like this stuff so much, it's not the best animation I've ever seen, even considering its age.  There is something different and seductive about it, though.
I think that part of the appeal is imagining a great Soviet Military/Animation complex filled with thousands of animators who 'draw or die' for Mother Russia.  Complete the image with one Kommisar for each animator and you really begin to appreciate these guys!
Or maybe these were underground animators, condemmed by the state and forced to live each day in fear for their right to animate!
Either way, I like it!
My favorite segment is one called Seasons.  Imagine a painfully beautiful RANKIN/BASS flick portraying all of two seasons.  Two!  I wait for the day I find the other 2 seasons as well because fall and winter are just gorgeous.  Maybe Russia only has fall and winter.
The rest of the animation is pretty good.  I recommend this if you like alternative animation or fancy yourself to be a tortured artist.  If you are the latter, grab a beret, pull up an uncomfortable stool and enjoy!",1051660800,5,1132,4.758974358974359
1083433,5,6305837201,"If you have any love of animation at all - the artistry, the depth, the impact - the Masters of Russian Animation volumes are a MUST OWN. In this edition, Norstein's ""Hedgehog in the Fog"" will tickle and please your visual imagination like NOTHING else! I presented this short film to an American suburban community center audience and they were SPELLBOUND! I've owned a lot of films on DVD (and sold a lot - crazy recession), but I'll never relinquish any of the four volumes in this series. NEVER! Enjoy, with my regards.",1039737600,18,523,4.634408602150538
7896398,5,6305837201,"after watching the first three of the masters of russian animation id have to say this is easily the best. included are the extraordinary hedgehog in the fog, the underrated contact, the beautiful ballerina on the boat. vol. 2 contains a large and varied assortment of russian animation greatness.",1275004800,,297,5.081632653061225
7896399,5,6305837201,"""Hedgehog in the Fog"" is the most magical piece of animation I've ever been privileged to witness. Eastern European animation in the late '60s and 70's shares a vision of the world that can be dark, yet soulful and deeply courageous. ""Hedgehog in the Fog"" evokes the same sense of magic that many of us experienced as young children. Vince Bonavoglia's depiction of this 10 minute short as ""dreary"" and ""dismal"" simply indicates what different universes each of us occupy.

Having watched this gem countless times on YouTube, I'm thrilled I can buy it as a DVD, along with other animation classics from Russia.",1259798400,,610,4.865384615384615
7896400,3,6305837201,"This video contains several points of interest for someone, such as me, learning to speak Russian. Not a whole lot of dialog among the dozen or so cartoons, but a little dialog, and some interesting animation twists. One of my farites on this compilation is ""Firing Range"", an animation about a Russian military tank outfitted with an electronic sensory system that can sense and respond to human fear. A message about science, and also the evils of war. There are other cartoons in this compilation which are lighthearted, but quite strange! ""Hedgehog in the Fog"", for one, a cartoon about a hedgehog who meets a bear every night and they count stars together. I think ""Butterfly"" is one of the intersting creative points in this collection. A boy sets out to capture a butterfly, and the butterfly turns enormously big, and, in turn, hunts the boy. There are some really 'trippy' moments in it. Good stuff! All in all, an interesting look at a more lighthearted side of the Russian psyche. It's worth a look!",1245196800,,1010,4.777142857142858
7896401,5,6305837201,"This collection is a must-have for every animation lovers. Yuri Norstein's shorts are absolutely magnificent (and you have 4 of them on this DVD). Hedgehog in the fog is a true masterpiece, poetic and full of hope and magic. Buy this collection today. You won't regret.",1242518400,,269,4.869565217391305
7896402,4,6305837201,"This is a great collection! for those who is unfamiliar with Soviet cartoons and never seen one it will be hard perhaps to understand the appeal of some of them. But considering most of them were made in 70's and remembering what was available in 70's as far as cartoons go will help. The best cartoon of this bunch is ""The Hedgehog In The Fog."" This piece was immensely popular in USSR at the time it was made. It certainly reflects what Russians value in animation - the story, the feelings, a little abstract thinking and the zen attitude. Great selection!",1206921600,,559,4.544554455445544
7896403,4,6305837201,"Geez, I did not know that Russian animators used to smoke the same stuff The Beatles did! I've just finished this collection, and although almost all are enjoyable in some way, I especially liked three: ""Ballerina on a boat"", which resembles the UPA cartoons of the same era in its minimalism, ""Butterfly"", which resembles Yellow Submarine's trippiest parts, and ""Crane Feathers"", which is curious because it is a Japanese folk story told by Russian animators. The last one, ""Contact"", is also very, very ""Pepperland"" (The town in ""Yellow Submarine""). I have a couple of gripes with this collection:

1) Although ""Seasons"" and ""Battle"" are widescreen, they are presented within a 4:3 frame.

2) English subtitles are hard-coded in the four shorts that have dialogue: Fox, Heron, Hedgehog and Firing Range.

3) Two of the shorts, ""Battle at Kerzhenets"" and ""Crane Feathers"", should have more detailed explanation in the booklet. The first one depicts historic Russian events and the second one, a Japanese folk tale.

All in all, I liked this DVD and I think it is a fine addition to my collection of mainstream and not-so-mainstream animation. Even my mother liked some of the shorts and started to found morals in some of them.

Note to parents (warning: spoiler): All these shorts are family-friendly. Most of them were made for children. The only short that would deserve a PG is ""Firing Range"" for stylized violence (people dying in explosions, but we see no blood or gore).

I'll add a still image extracted from each short so you can see for yourself the quality of these works. I hope this helps you to make up your mind and buy it.",1191196800,3,1639,4.85663082437276
7896404,5,6305837201,"I really, really enjoyed this collection.  Yuri Norstein's shorts, ""Hedgehog in the Fog"" in particular, are absolutely incredible.  The kind of depth he can create with only two dimensions to work with is truly impressive. Also prepare to be amazed by ""Butterfly"" and ""Ballerina on the Boat.""",1137369600,4,292,5.191489361702128
7896405,5,6305837201,"As a big fan of stop-motion animation, I was impressed by the offerings this DVD had.  Highly recommended!",1124236800,,106,4.888888888888889
7896406,5,6305837201,"Yes my Amazon name is a nod, if not an outright ripoff, from the Y. Norstein short included here. This disc is awesome! Norstein, the Miyazaki of Russia, is featured in this disc with four of his films represented here. I gain so much joy from watching these shorts. Just when we built up the notion of the evil red empire, our preseption will be forever changeed when we see these gems from our former enemy. The true masters of world animation are included here!",1121644800,6,464,4.470588235294118
7896407,5,6305837201,"This DVD is worth gold just for the ""Seasons"" and the ""Battle of Kerzhenets"". The Seasons is one of the most exquisitely beautiful films I've ever seen by one of the greatest animators of the previous century, the Russian Ivanov-Vano. It is made on a multiplane (I think), using traditional russian lace designs and russian toys. The music is the ""Seasons"" (naturally) by Tchaikovsky. It's stunning and whenever I get a chance to watch it, I always get a sense of beauty and peace. Sometimes, I just wish I could live in that magical, fairytale world that Ivanov-Vano created.

The ""Battle of Kerzhenets"" is another film by Ivanov-Vano based on Russian Orthodox icons. A feast for the eyes, beautiful and original in all respects. The score is Rimsky-Korsakov.

Higly, highly recommended.",1120089600,11,788,5.00763358778626
