6028451,4,B00FRH0HUE,"The bad guys are trying to kill the good guys, but  - well, ok, the good guy and maybe-good guy, but it turns out that some of the bad guys are actually good. Then the good guy(s?) go off to find the main bad guy, meet some other guys and girls, some good, some bad, only to find that some of the good guys, both the good guys from before and some new guys, are actually bad guys! And some others might be too! However, among the bad guys, they find some unexpected allies.

Then it gets really complicated.  But not in a bad way!

If you love twists and turns, double-crosses, plots, conspiracies, last minute saves, peril and intrigue, youve come to the right wuxia. Absurd and melodramatic in the best possible way, this is a headache-inducing overdose of wuxia tropes from Chor Yuen (who else?) starring the great Ti Lung. Colorful, crazy, exhaustingits like a night on the town that leaves you hungover and thinking I don't remember what happenedbut I know I had a good time.

Some will read that and think that doesnt sound like a good time. You people keep away  this is not for those new to what I call acid wuxia. If you want to dip your toes into the genre, try something like THE MAGIC BLADE, or maybe DEATH DUEL. But if you're a fan of wuxia, its a good fix.",1400716800,9,1270,4.292887029288703
6028452,5,B00FRH0HUE,my favorite is Ti Lung and this was a good movie for it's time.  I came as you said it would  and when so again thank you very,1399248000,,126,3.4642857142857144
8618260,4,B00FRH0HUE,"Welcome to Bat Island: a dangerous haven of questing swordsmen, assassins, and the dead. This is a section of the description. Right out front I love these old kung fu, flying through the air, bouncing all over the place movies I truly do. I can usually follow the story too but in this case it had me bamboozled at times. and I was lost a bit of the time. This seemed to be essentially a mystery as several fighters are heading to Bat Island and they are being picked off one at a time. The fights were as always very good but when we finally get to Bat Island we have the showdown and I am still not certain what I was watching.",1509580800,,630,4.130081300813008
8618261,5,B00FRH0HUE,Chinese kung-fu version of Sherlock Holmes like story. Interesting characters and lots of weirdness hold the viewer's attention. Worthwhile!,1503619200,,140,6.421052631578948
8618262,4,B00FRH0HUE,Nothing like kung fu,1503532800,,20,4.25
8618263,4,B00FRH0HUE,"To Long plays a fighter who travels to a mysterious island to find out why they want him dead. It's action packed and a fun movie to see even if the plots not the best. It's very complicated in a mystery sort of way. I'm deducting one star because the picture and sound quality wasn't the best. It was like watching one of those old Shaw bro bootlegs I used to buy back in the early 2000s. The movie also stars Ling yun, Ching Li and Liu Hung.",1497571200,,443,4.045454545454546
8618264,4,B00FRH0HUE,"Legend of the Bat (1978) is the sequel to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clans-of-Intrigue/dp/B000W1V4Y8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clans of Intrigue</a>&nbsp;(1977), while the sequel to Legend of the Bat (1978) is&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Perils-of-the-Sentimental-Swordsman/dp/B006P5YS7A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Perils of the Sentimental Swordsman</a>&nbsp;(1982).  Therefore the correct viewing order is to watch (1) Clans of Intrigue first, then (2) Legend of the Bat, and then (3) Perils of the Sentimental Swordsman.

Confusingly, Perils of the Sentimental Swordsman (1982) is most emphatically NOT the sequel to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sentimental-Swordsman/dp/B0086K6RM6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sentimental Swordsman</a>&nbsp;(1977) nor&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Return-of-the-Sentimental-Swordsman/dp/B004UEFBLA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Return of the Sentimental Swordsman</a>&nbsp;(1981).

Ti Lung's character in both Clans of Intrigue and Legend of the Bat is named Chu Liu Hsiang, while he is named General Chu Liu Hsiang in Perils of the Sentimental Swordsman.

Ti Lung's character in The Sentimental Swordsman is named Little Flying Dagger Li, and in Return of the Sentimental Swordsman he is named Li Xunhuan.

I thought I should mention this to anyone who really liked/likes Legend of the Bat (1978) because it explains the continuity for those who want to watch the related films in sequence.",1464739200,2,1619,8.281609195402298
8618265,2,B00FRH0HUE,"Legend of the Bat is probably a fabulous original Shaw movie, but this copy is nearly unwatchable.  It looks unpleasantly like a bootleg, or something that was transferred on a  non-professional computer.  I ordered several movies simultaneously and didn't watch this until last week, so Amazon is refusing to allow me to return  it.  Fie, shame and desecration of Master Ti Lung and crew.",1450224000,3,389,5.015625

8618268,5,B00FRH0HUE,Ti Lung is one of my favorite kung fu actors.  Any movie that he starred in from the Shaw brothers is a great kung-fu movie.  You will love this movie 's you like the kung-fu movies from the 70's.,1433116800,,196,4.0
8618269,4,B00FRH0HUE,Good movie.  It had a plot of mystery and intrigue which I never realized before as I have always been a fan of Ti Lung sword movies.,1421798400,2,133,3.925925925925926
