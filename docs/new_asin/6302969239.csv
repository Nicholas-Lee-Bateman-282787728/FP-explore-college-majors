Not only constitutes an admirable epic effort and artistic portrait but besides it's an artwork never equaled previous or lately. This gem of 1922 deals with the hard conditions of Eskimo life: the walrus hunt sequence or the ice bath still remain in my memory.

One of the sublime milestones in the whole Cinema Story, and obviously Flaherty's glorious masterpiece!",1117238400,8,508,5.195121951219512
525144,5,6302969239,Most of what I could say has already been said.  It is an important historical document of a vanished way of life.  It is a unique tribute to one man & his stand agianst the elements.  Flaherty invented documentary as we now know it in this film. The filmmaker displays almost as much tenacity & courage in recording the material as Nanook does in his everyday life.  A measure of the film's greatness is the profound effect it had on Orson Welles.  After seeing the film Welles is said to have abandoned the editing of his 'Magnificent Ambersons' & taken on a journey to South America to shoot in documentary style.,1020211200,22,616,4.513513513513513
525145,5,6302969239,"Robert Flaherty's ""Nanook of the North"" is a true classic of ethnographic film. The principle behind anthropological film in the early days of its existence was to capture traditional societies in time, a sort of ""salvage ethnography."" In doing so, filmmakers like Flaherty and others particularly focused on Amerindian cultures, which were seen as a dying remnant of early America. In creating his silent masterpiece, Flaherty used actors of Inuit extraction, who still knew the traditional ways, and who could reproduce their culture for posterity through film. Though his methods have been criticized as contrived and retrogressive, post-modernist rhetoric has not succeeded in ruining this film in the popular or anthropological circles. ""Nanook"" remains a warm account of traditional Inuit/Eskimo life, despite their frigid setting. The DVD collectable edition contains some photo galleries and useful material about Flaherty and his subjects.",972086400,53,948,5.7304964539007095
525146,5,6302969239,"The small band of people have to struggle to survive.  The threat of starvation is always present.  The land is harsh. And yet there is much joy in this film.  There are several children who laugh and play with the  puppies and play sliding games on the snow.  There's a chubby baby of 4  months old who travels in the hood of his mother's coat. There's Nanook's  wife who is always smiling.  And dogs who work hard to pull the  sleds.
The viewer sees the small troop hunt for walrus and seal. There is  struggle and then there is joy as they eat pieces of the raw meat.  We also  see them construct an igloo within one hour, the whole family working  together with their flat bone knives as their only tool.  I understand that  this film has been criticized because this scene was staged and that a  special igloo had to be created in order to film the interior, but I can't  see how else this could have been done.
The viewer really identifies with  the people and their daily struggle and I was saddened to learn that two  years after the film was produced, Nanook died of starvation during a deer  hunt.
In spite of the limited amount of technology available to Flaherty,  he did a spectacular job, and the film stands today as an important  historical document.  Absolutely one of the best documentaries I have ever  seen. Highly recommended.",952905600,19,1347,4.471074380165289
525147,5,6302969239,"An amazing depiction of survival in an almost unimaginably harsh environment.  The consummate hunter, Nanook sustains his small faily in a land almost entirely devoid of vegetation, builds fires without wood and  catches fish without bait.  (Despite his prowess, Nanook died of starvation  a year after this film was made, a sad postscript to this life-affirming  documentary about an impossibly fragile mode of existence.)",946771200,11,423,5.546875
525148,5,6302969239,"I always thought ""Nanook of the North"" was just a metaphor for an overly bundled-up person -- until I came across his eponymous movie!  I was dumbfounded and mesmerized by this <remarkable> 1-hour documentary.  It was filmed in frozen northern Canada in the early 1900's, silent and in  black-and-white, of course.

Nanook is patriarch of a native Hudson Bay family (think ""Eskimos"") who live on the pitiless edge of survival.  Yet these are sweet, sweet people.  The camera follows mainly Nanook through days of daunting challenges centered on food and shelter from the cold.  In  one astonishing scene after another, Nanook:

1.) sneaks up on and  harpooons a huge walrus,  2.) has a titanic struggle with a seal through an ice hole, and  3.) carves and assembles in less than one hour a large igloo, which includes an a-m-a-z-i-n-g feature that will have you talking to yourself.

What comes out of his kayak will have you gasping.

This is great film-making, notable all the more due to severity of conditions, remoteness of location and unsophisticated technology of the period.  I don't expect to ever see anything quite like this again.

Nanook irrestibly earns your respect and affection. The movie brought him international attention.  News of his death two years later elicited condolences from around the world.

Flicker Alley and David Shepard have out done the old Criterion DVD of Nanook of the North. Criterion is generally the level of excellence to match, but Flicker Alley is quickly showing they are also the name for quality.

The biggest improvement I see is cleaner motion. The old Criterion transfer suffered from ""Motion Blur"" possibly due to slowing down the film to silent film speed. The Criterion DVD also had an interlace stutter that caused objects moving up & down to jitter as they moved. This was quite noticeable just after the titles when we see the rolling sea of ice. The Ice jitters up & down on the old DVD.

There is also an improvement in the image sharpness, the Criterion looks like 16mm (they claim it is from a 35mm fine grain mastered from a 35mm restoration negative derived from positive nitrate prints). I am very surprised at how poor the Criterion transfer looks.

The Flicker Alley transfer seems to come from the same 1972 restoration negative, but this time it looks like 35mm. There is some film dust in the picture, but not distracting. But now BLUE COLOR TINTS have been added to the last 10 minutes as the title card reads ""It is now getting dark"".

The original title card must be lost as both transfers re-create the main title. Criterions inserts images from the movir which looks wrong, I thought it was another DVD menu. The Flicker Alley title card tries to look more original with with lettering over black background, but it is too sharp and still looks recreated.

As you can tell by the title of this release, this is a DOUBLE FEATURE

I will review ""The Wedding of Palo"" and update this later.

BONUS MATERIAL. David Shepard & Flicker Alley giveth & taketh away.
Missing: The Criterion DVD had a short 8:13 excerpt from the NET (National Educational Television) TV show ""Flaherty and Film"" that interviews Robert Flaherty's wife about her husband and the making of Nanook. I will have to ask David why this was omitted, but I suspect it is because her remarks about 'modern' documentaries is degrading. She calls them low budget 16mm short films not intended for the mass audiences in theaters (don't tell Kevin Smith). Now days this is not true and this may be why Davis Shepard omitted this.

BUT there are NEW bonuses:
NANOOK REVISITED - a 1988 64 minute documentary by Claude Mascott
HOUSES OF THE ARTIC (1928) - an excerpt from Nanook that was re-edited as a short subject.

525172,5,6302969239,"This film is a masterpiece.  Even some 90+ years since it was filmed and produced, it maintains the highest quality of presentation and serves as the foundation for modern day documentaries that we enjoy.  The film chronicles the miserable lives of Eskimos and the nonstop violence they commit against animals who also live in the region.  The film centers on a brave Eskimo named Nanook and his family.  The lives of Eskimos are extremely basic functioning around (1) Hunting, (2) Building igloos, (3) Having children, and (4) Sleeping.  There is no intellectual or cultural life that is depicted among the Eskimos and very little time to even play other than a short clip of Nanook playing with his son showing him how to hunt with a toy bow and arrow. This is important in illustrating the rigors of Eskimo life. Despite the very basic nature of Eskimo life, life in the Canadian Arctic is very hard for the Inuit Tribe of Eskimos and there is no guarantee of anything.  This film does an excellent job of capturing a life long forgotten for the viewers and bringing to life a group of people, who for most of us do not exist outside of the stories told about them.  Overall, I highly recommend this film for its cultural, social, and historical significance.",1360972800,,1262,4.709090909090909
525173,5,6302969239,"This silent film remains a remarkable milestone in early film making and equally fascinating effort to produce documentary film.
According to Wiki, Nanook of the North (also known as Nanook of the North: A Story Of Life and Love In the Actual Arctic) is a 1922 silent documentary film by Robert J. Flaherty. In the tradition of what would later be called salvage ethnography, Flaherty captured the struggles of the Inuk Nanook and his family in the Canadian Arctic. The film is considered the first feature-length documentary. This is one of the original first 25 films selected for preservation in the U.S. National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"". It remains as an important film not only of it's era, but for the length, breadth, content and direction it took.",1360540800,,838,5.079710144927536

I *believe* this ""Nanook of the north"" is the origin of the phrase.  :-)  I gave it a 5-star rating, not for being a ""best movie"", but for its cinematic and cultural value.

In particular, I was impressed by the eerie, brooding score that accompanied the film, with it's haunting contrabass subtly reinforcing the film's icy, desert-like barrenness. It conveyed beautifully the quiet desperation of Nanook and his family as they courageously - and against all odds - eked out a meager existence against the backdrop of the unrelenting inhospitability of the Arctic. It was a magnificent merger of story, cinematography and score. Truly an achievement.

I can't begin to say how disappointed I was when I played the DVD. The original score had been replaced by a New Age ensemble accompaniment that completely altered the tenor of the movie. The evocative ambience of the original was lost. The new score is a completely incongruous loop of mediocre New Age ensemble music that occasionally mounts to inexplicable crescendos hopelessly unrelated to the action of the film; it is totally devoid of and in fact defies any empathic sensibility. I finally muted the sound and watched the movie in silence. It was a vast improvement, but still nowhere near the impact of the original. What were the producers of this re-release thinking?

Despite it originally being presented by Flaherty as more fact than fiction, its value from a postmodern perspective might also be assessed from the performances of the Inuit actors, who undoubtedly played an important part in the manufacturing their own past.

Flaherty suffered burns in many parts of his body and had to recover before going back north.  He had made copious notes of his previous film and was able to recreate most scenes again.  Not your typical documentary now, but was at this time.  Filmmakers were quite aware of having to make the film entertaining and interesting to watch.  Not unlike today! The 20s was the heyday of anthropology and of documentary film so they went together nicely.  Flaherty has made a spine-tingling film where the cold can be felt as well as seen.

525187,4,6302969239,"If you have any interest in documentary filmmaking, indigenous film, ethnography, or a related field, you should absolutely see 'Nanook.' Having said that, I'm always shocked at how little context the average viewer has before they take this film in. Sure, maybe a first viewing of a film that sets so many precedents should be undertaken unprejudiced, but any meaningful understanding of this film can only take shape with some basic knowledge of the debates and discourses that surround it.

The movie, as I'm sure many reviewers before me have explained, is ostensibly an ethnographic document of an Inuit hunter named Nanook's struggle to survive with his family in the area around Hudson Bay. The film documents a number of activities that, depending on your level of cynicism, either represent the Inuit lifestyle at a particular period in time, or are selected for their potential novelty to members of the film's eventual audience.

Either before or after your first viewing of the film, know this: the wildly inaccurate intertitles aren't the most misleading thing about this film. Rather than be exhaustive about the film's inaccuracies, I'll let you seek out your own information. I will mention that by the time Flaherty was making this film, Inuit hunters were using rifles. Also, Nanook's family aren't exactly his family. They're really just the most photogenic Inuit that Flaherty could find to fill the roles.

Flaherty argued that he was trying to document a set of Inuit cultural practices that were in danger of slipping into the ether. Whether this is entirely sincere or not, who knows. But beyond deciding whether or not you like the movie (which is a more basic and personal consideration), you need to know this so you can try to understand what Flaherty's getting at here and see the cinematic world he presents in its own, highly specialized and hybrid context.

The film itself is a delightful watch. It continues to be entertaining, regardless of whether or not you're into silent film. Criterion's print looks fantastic and the music they've put it to is appropriate.

That's all bonus, though, because the movie will always be the foundation upon which so much important work was built, so as soon as you know it exists and is relevant to your interest, you should watch it. Just be sure to dip into the discourse surrounding it at some point during the window of time when the film is occupying your thoughts. You'll see the film and its many, diverse successors more clearly for having done so.",1232064000,4,2527,4.936470588235294

525189,5,6302969239,"Nanook of the North is an enduring picture, filled with warmth and humanity and presenting an unfliching portrait of thhe rigors endured by Nanook and his family in one of the most inhospitable physical settings imaginable. Considering those rigors, I was impressed by the fact that Nanook and his clan seem to be among the happiest people on earth. (So was filmmaker Robert Flaherty, whose admiration for Nanook is obvious in his comments on the title cards. In the preface, we get a lump in our throats to learn that Flaherty's unlikely ""star"" perished of starvation while on a long hunt the year after Flaherty finished shooting the picture.) The walrus and seal hunt scenes are thrilling, and the scene in which Nanook's entire family - wife, numerous children, and dog - emerge from the tiny kayak in which they have been riding with him, is worthy of the great silent comics! The picture quality of this home video release is exceptional. (Reel seems to have used the same print as the Kino edition.)

Nanook's people, the Inuit, are still still there on Hudson's Bay. Today, they are the ""canary in the mine shaft"" where global warming is concerned. The fact that they have recently had to move from the mainland onto Baffin Island in search of game does not bode well for the rest of us.",1213833600,8,1295,4.704845814977974
525190,5,6302969239,Nanook of the North provides not only an extremely accurate view of Inuit life but makes one wonder why sub arctic families cannot live and love together. It is a world modern man could not survive which should make us envious.,1203552000,,227,4.560975609756097
525191,5,6302969239,"This is one of the earliest documentries ever filmed.  It is hokay and obviously made up, but much of it is the real thing from a time that has been lost.  The opening scene with the qayaq is amazing, as is the scene where a bearded seal is pulled from its breathing hole.  I am aware that this last scene I mentioned has been sanitised, but many of the other scenes are exactly what they represent and if you buy this film and watch it, you will come away the feeling that you have been given an opening into the time and a people that have been lost to us forever.  Watch it!",1195430400,3,577,4.079646017699115
525192,5,6302969239,This film lives up to all I have read about it. For me as a documentary filmmaker it is important to make these kinds of connections with the pioneers of this format. Nanook of the North is a must-have for anyone who is serious about the documentary format.,1189814400,,257,4.375
525193,5,6302969239,"I'm so glad I saw this documentary. I didn't realize that any movies in 1922 were this well-crafted.  It was a pleasure to watch as well as being educational. I was born and raised in Alaska; lived there 40 years in fact.  But I had never seen an igloo until I saw one built in this movie. (Inuits do not live in igloos; igloos are more like camping tents.)  And the ""transportation system"" was incredible.  What a hoot when the entire family pours out of the interior of one kayak. I'm thinking of buying this film now that it is on DVD.",1186790400,6,538,4.245098039215686
525194,5,6302969239,"This is a glimpse into an amazing way of life which, for the most part, no longer exists.  The Filmmaker was an explorer before he became a filmmaker, so great care is taken to tell these people's story, through the example of one main character: Nanook, the Bear.  I was pleased at how well this work has been preserved and transfered to the new medium of DVD.  If you are interested in the Arctic region, Anthropology, History, or even great Adventure, you will enjoy Nanook of the North.",1175990400,3,490,4.545454545454546
525195,5,6302969239,"When I watched this classic documentary, I couldn't help but think that if we ever had to get back to the level of living portrayed here, we just wouldn't make it. What it took for Inuits to survive and the almost always smiling faces on them makes me think that despite our modern proclivity for shopping malls, body-piercing, Hummers and rap music, underneath it all is a heritage that is raw, rich and admirable; and thank god somebody was able to capture it to film before it was swallowed up. It would be interesting to produce Nanook II and show what goes on in this remote part of the world now.",1163203200,,602,4.4324324324324325
525196,5,6302969239,"""Nanook of the North"" has a place in cinematic history as the first feature-length documentary, shot by Robert J. Flaherty near Inukjuaq on Hudson Bay in the arctic part of Quebec, Canada. A former explorer and prospector in that region, Flaherty decided to document the lifestyle of the Inuit, with funds provided by the French fur company Revillion Freres. The result was an early opportunity for people to see a movie that showed that a distant place and a foreign culture, rather than something staged on a set in a studio. Focusing on the title character and his family, ""Nanook of the North"" showed the traditional Inuit ways of hunting and fishing, building igloos, and other cultural aspects. Consequently, Flaherty's film is considered a prime example of what is called salvage ethnography, which had to do with capturing a record of a culture before it disappeared.

There are questions about the degree to which Flaherty manipulated situations and edited his film. We know that Flaherty picked an Inuit named Allakariallak to be his star because he was the most famous hunter in that area, but we also know that Nyla and Cuanyou, the two Inuit women cast as his wives, were not his wives, any more than Allee and Allegoo were his sons, carried around by their ""mothers"" in the hoods of their parkas. Anthropologists agree that the way we see Nanook and the other Inuit hunting seals and whales are traditional practices, but there is reason to believe Flaherty would not let his subjects use guns and made them hunt in the manner of their ancestors. Consequently, what we have here could be the recreation of traditional Inuit ways of hunting, which still has to be of some value. Besides, the life of hunting on the ice that Flaherty shows is indeed as dangerous as it looks, where a seal could prove to be as deadly as a walrus, and Allakariallak would die two years later when he was lost in a storm.

We understand that by contemporary standards Flaherty's practices would be considered unethical for someone making a documentary film, but since he was a pioneer in this field he gets the benefit of working at a time when rules did not exist to be broken. Hearing stories of how special igloos had to be constructed so that Flaherty could have his large camera inside to shoot family scenes speaks more to his attempt to show people what it was like than an attempt to just make things up, so overall I am comfortable with the sense of mimesis established here. Only at the end, when we are supposed to believe Nanook's family are desperately searching for shelter, does the documentary really descend into dramatic license that is clearly over the line.

All things considered, ""Nanook of the North"" might not be true, but for the most part it comes across as being real, which is ultimately more important. I can see elements that might be considered racist, but I have to wonder if that is because the film has the audacity to suggest that the stereotypical view of the Inuit as happy people is more true than false. Then again, lots of people smile a lot more when they know a camera is on them. The 1922 documentary runs 79 minutes and remains in fairly good condition, with a passable chamber music score. There is also a brief interview with Flaherty's widow from the 1950s and a selection of still photographs from both the ""Nanook of the North"" shoot and some of Flaherty's other trips through the Arctic north. The historic value of ""Nanook of the North"" might outweigh the artistic, but not by much.",1153872000,9,3526,4.702265372168285
525197,5,6302969239,"I believe this is known as the first official known documentary film. Like all good documentaries, it was able to make me, the viewer, relate to the subject. I was able to empathize and feel for the plight of Nanook and his family. Such a classic!",1151971200,5,247,4.391304347826087
525198,5,6302969239,"Nanuk, el esquimal no solo fue el primer film de Robert Flaherty sino que fue tambin el film documental que, junto a El hombre de la cmara de Dziga Vertov, se distingui del resto de las producciones documentales de la poca al abrir un nuevo camino en el entendimiento de lo real mediante las imgenes cinematogrficas. Y es que para Flaherty crear una imagen no era asunto de registrar lo que apareca ante el lente de la cmara; las imgenes tenan que ser descubiertas para ser inventadas y as convertirse en metforas. De ah su sorprendente y polmico mtodo de trabajo: aos y aos de rodaje y revelado, de observacin y envolvimiento, de manipulacin muchas veces inescrupulosa. Nanuk, el esquimal surgi luego de varias expediciones a la Baha Hudson en Canad, realizadas por Flaherty y su esposa y colaboradora Frances Flaherty, bajo la nmina de Sir William Mackenzie con el fin de averiguar el potencial ferroviario y mineral de toda esa vasta regin. Conmovido por la experiencia humana de las gentes que habitaban esos parajes, en una de esas expediciones llev consigo una cmara de fotografa y una de cine. Una vez all, invent en el transcurso de varios aos la historia de Nanuk, un cazador de la etnia Inuit, y su lucha por la supervivencia en un ambiente hostil. El film fue proyectado con mucha concurrencia en el ao 1922 y desde entonces ha sido una de las piedras ms slidas de la corta historia del cine. Con este film Flaherty dio un giro totalmente indito, incluso hoy da, del quehacer cinematogrfico y mostr lo que exige e implica la construccin, mediante imgenes, de un modo particular de observar lo real: un compromiso con lo que se observa que nos hace cmplices de lo que aparece ante los ojos; si bien Robert Flaherty no siempre le hizo justicia a lo real, s, al menos, nunca le hizo injusticia.",1151712000,3,1802,4.652037617554859

7832605,3,6302969239,"""Nanook of the North"" is one of my favorite silent films, with the ever stalwart Nanook (""The Bear"") and his cute wife Nyla (""The One Who Smiles"") and their bevy of adorable children. Filmed in the Canadian Artic from August 1920 through August 1921 and released in 1922, ""Nanook of the North"" has been recognized as one of the greatest documentaries ever made.

The problem with this release is that it appears to be a copy of an earlier (and better) release of this film on DVD. The picture for the most part is dark and muddy, and the Korean subtitles are very hard to turn off.

This is an inexpensive release and it is watchable, but it could have been better. As for Nanook and his family's story, this is a story that much be seen.  And, I am sure, that this way of life vanished long ago.",1465084800,,796,4.328859060402684
