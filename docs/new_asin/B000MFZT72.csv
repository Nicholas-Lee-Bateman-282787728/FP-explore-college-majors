8168373,4,B000MFZT72,"""BOXING'S BEST: Muhammad Ali"" was originally a free gift offered with a subscription to a popular sports magazine. It's a clean HiFi dub of a 1981 HBO documentary on the boxer that his trainer Angelo Dundee freely admits here to being the greatest heavyweight of all time.

Mostly brief, often low-contrast fight clips are interspersed with commentary or equally short excerpts of training, press conferences and news reports. Little of Muhammad Ali's life beyond the usual anecdotes is revealed. Missing is the thrashing Ali gave former champ Floyd Patterson, who insisted on calling him ""Clay."" Also no mention of the famous simulated 1969 battle with Rocky Marciano
