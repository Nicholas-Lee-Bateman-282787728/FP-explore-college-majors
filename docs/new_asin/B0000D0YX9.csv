1920298,1,B0000D0YX9,Cinefear has done a horrible job with the release of this DVD.  The picture and sound quailty are terrible.  I paid $20.00 for this DVD and it is not even worth $5.00.,1102118400,15,167,4.1875
1920299,1,B0000D0YX9,"This is not a review of ""Abby"" per se, but rather a warning to stay away from the pirate (yes, pirate) disc released by the bootleg store Cinefear, of which the reviews below (probably planted by Cinefear itself) rave. WAIT for the proper upcoming DVD of ""Abby"" instead of buying the high-price, horrible-quality, shoddily-made Cinefear disc. Why should you avoid Cinefear's bootleg disc? Well, it's detailed e.g. here - [...] - but for brevity, let me count some reasons:

- ""Abby"" was, of course, shot in widescreen. Cinefear's blatant lie on the cover is just an excuse for the fact that they made their bootleg disc full-screen only.

- Cinefear's ""transfer"" is an extremely ugly VHS transfer, full of tears, holes, smudges, artifacts, jumps and dirt. The sound is dull and hollow and the chapters freeze and skip. Their claim that this atrocity had been transferred from the original print is a blatant lie - you can actually find older pirate releases of ""Abby"" that look better than Cinefear's schlocky offer.

- There are no ""many more"" extras that Cinefear promises. A trailer, a radio spot, a description of the film and poster reproductions are there, and that's it.

- Cinefear asks the typical price of their pirate videos for ""Abby"", a price that is considerably higher than that of legal, high-quality DVDs.

Wait for the proper disc. Though Glen Danzig gave up its production, ""Abby"" *is* being prepared for a future release in a transfer from the actual film print, not an old VHS tape.",1101600000,68,1503,4.85546875

This is Carol Speed's best performance out of all the Blaxploitation movies she did during the 70's even better than the other classic ""The Mack"". As well as being a funny movie (Abby kicking her husband right in the breadbasket during one scene!!) there are actually some scary moments such as the scene where Abby is helping prepare food with other women and the evil force within her take's over and she start's to cut her arm with a rather large blade while licking her lips demon like !!!
I also love love William Marshall's performance in this movie, he was born to play the part of trying to free Abby of this demon within her. If you like William Marshall check out the great and also funny ""Blacula"" movies.
So in a nutshell I can't promote this film enough, just buy it for the fact its a great film and its very rare.",1074816000,9,1013,4.30890052356021

I expected to buy this DVD through Amazon, but on the day it was suppose to be released, it was suddenly ""unavailable."" I wonder what happened? Anyway, thank God (no pun intended) I got it anyway through Cinefear. I am definitely not disappointed! It is what it is, a really BAD - GREAT movie. Get it now since it's really HARD TO GET.

1920305,5,B0000D0YX9,"Abby is a one of a kind gem - a horror baxploitation version of THE EXORCIST that must be seen to be believed in all its campy glory! Starring William Marshall, who you may remember as Blacula, and 70s cutie Carol Speed, this is not a DVD to be missed! but not sure why the Amazon listing above says '2000' - the movie was released in 1974!
The Cinefear SPECIAL EDITION was worth every penny, and features plenty of extras to keep the fans at bay. I really enjoyed this disc overall and will watch it more than once. I beleive all horror, blaxploitation and cult/ bad movie fans should have a copy of this in their collection.
The SE version features the theatrical trailer, behind the scenes photos, a radio ad (read by 70s cult actor Adolph Caesar!!!), poster repros, lobby cards - plus more... and even an Easter Egg!! Glad to see this classic flick making its way on DVD!
Get your demoic groove on with this groovy ghoulie!

Highly Recommended!",1071187200,8,954,4.488505747126437
1920306,5,B0000D0YX9,"This DVD had me hysterical from beginning to end.  The movie ""Abby"" is about an African-American woman who ends up being possessed by a demon of sexuality called Eshu and goes from being a sweet docile little minister's wife to a sexually charged, no nonsense, lusty, impish, take control type of woman who acts on her every desire.  I think that her character improves tremendously once the possession takes over!  She goes from meek and unhappy to someone who knows how to have some fun.
Watching Abby transform is hysterical.  Some must see scenes include the fried chicken scene, the church choir scene, and the car scene where she gets a little ""rough"" with her prospective lover.  This movie is one hundred times funnier than the so called comedies that are out nowadays.
Carol Speed, the actress who plays ""Abby"", probably gave the acting performance of her life in this film.  The late, great William Marshall who acted in such blaxploitation classics as ""Blacula,"" gives a commanding performance as Abby's father-in-law who combats the demon to save Abby's soul.
This DVD version released by Cinefear has many fun extras, including the original trailer, a radio spot advertising the film, and tons of lobby cards, rare production stills, and a poster gallery.  There is also an extensive history of ""Abby.""
I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who has any interest in horror, blaxploitation, or just wants to be highly entertained for 90 minutes.  Watch this movie and see why movies made in the early 1970's are the best.",1071100800,13,1532,4.910852713178294

That's too bad because the plot is interesting, about a devout woman who becomes possessed by a sex demon (yikes!). William Marshall's in this one, a great classically trained actor, but actors have to eat too, and during the so-called blaxploitation era, movies like this abounded.

Whoever owns the rights to Abby PLEASE consider a re-mastering of the source film!",1363824000,4,461,4.8354430379746836
1920320,5,B0000D0YX9,"A minister's wife becomes possessed by a demon that was probably unleashed by his father while he was excavating in Nigeria. If you take 'The Exorcist', 'The Amityville Horror' and 'Scream Blacula, Scream', and mash them all together, you have 1974's 'Abby'. I was not expecting much from this film and maybe that's why I am SO shockingly surprised at it's quality. It's not ""so bad it's good"", it's just good! Although the disco music seems out of place in a horror setting like this, the acting is decent and the story is well told. There is no doubt that the plot is a REALLY close copy of a much more popular movie, but to me that doesn't hurt it one bit. In fact when you see the lead character Abby starting to act weird, you almost feel true sorrow for her and her family because if you ever watched 'The Exorcist', and I'm sure 99.998% of you saw that film before this one, you have some idea of what is in store for them all. Because of Abby's age, they are allowed to show a little more sexual deviance which is a nice evil touch, especially from a minister`s wife. The special effects are well done and the constantly changing voices within the possessed lead female are great. The movie itself has a very creepy element to it and it is a little more action packed than it's big studio twin (slightly older twin). In fact, if you just look at it as a sequel to 'The Exorcist' rather than a rip off, I think you'll enjoy it much more. Trust me, Friedkin would much rather have 'Abby' as his sequel than the real 'Exorcist Part 2'! The crew of 'Abby' had plenty of original ideas outside of the film that they were copying and the movie deserves a lot more respect. That respect should start with a nice, clean, official release on DVD. The few copies I've seen and the one that I own are all bootleg quality with a few skips and pauses that look like they were recorded on a Beta machine back in 1979. Great film, but I would call the quality of the DVDs released so far to be well below par.",1333843200,,2002,4.298941798941799

1920324,1,B0000D0YX9,". . the other version offered here, ""The Black Exorcist Version.""  Simply look for ""Cinefear"" or ""CF"" as the seller, and avoid it at all costs.
""Sadly, I actually purchased this DVD from ""Cinefear's"" web site, and payed a hefty price for it. Without doubt, this is by far the worst transfer of any film that I have ever purchased, and this includes many of those dollar store, public domain movies. They try to play it off as ""just be glad you're able to see it at all,"" but, I'd rather not watch it than to see it like this. Trust me, it's that horrible !
Not only is it a horrendous transfer, but there's also a main menu/chapter problem going on. When you press play from the main menu, it takes several minutes for the film to even start, and then it skips right over the beginning, jumping to the 2nd or 3rd chapter. You have to hit the slow-rewind button to get to the beginning, and this takes awhile.
Cinefear has made quite a bit of money off this piece of junk DVD, as it was their biggest seller ever. That's OK, as we all know that Karma always comes back around and takes care of rotten, greedy, liars and crooks.""

PROS:  One of the best blaxploitation films.  The corny, over-the-top acting is sure to entertain.  Worthy to be labeled a 70s ""midnight"" or ""grindhouse"" film.

CONS:  If you're like me, you enjoy a gitty, sometimes poor, film quality.  It sets the right mood for a film of this type.  However, beware, there is a mix of poor quality that suggest this version was transfered from a VHS version.  Poor video and poor film quality are much different.",1202601600,6,650,4.573913043478261

1920333,4,B0000D0YX9,"I was very happy to see Abby again after over 30 years. I have always been a big fan of Carol Speed and her 1970's movies. Prior to reading the movie's ending credits, I was not aware that Carol actually wrote the song she sang in the movie. Also, I felt the overall duplication of Abby (on DVD) was not that bad.  Having said that, do not expect to see and compare Abby to a recently-made movie you would normally buy today on DVD.  Movies today are filmed with a lot better technology.  Remember, Abby was filmed  over 30 years ago and on a very low budget. I own several DVDs of movies filmed during the 70's and they all look the about same in overall picture clarity.

You can really tell Abby was duplicated from some type of film to DVD.  We all have had or seen movies dubbed from a VHS tape to another. This Abby DVD is a little better quality than a first-generation-duplicated VHS tape product. The DVD does contain some grainy areas and lines which will remind you of something recorded on a VHS tape; however, it's still better than a standard bootleg movie recorded with a personal video camera. I do not believe the DVD was made from a digitally remastered and restored print direct from film--as advertised by Cinefear; more likely VHS to DVD!

If you do decide to purchase a copy of Abby, it will definitely be a product of  Cinefear. They are the only company currently producing and distributing Abby on DVD. Thirteen years ago, Cinefear began selling Abby on VHS for over $70. Cinefear is currently selling Abby for $20 (DVD) on their website. There are many sellers where you can find on-line to purchase the movie--just find the one with the cheapest price.  I bought my Abby DVD from Gold Medal Hair's website for $9.98. For myself, it was  worth the price to see this 70's movie classic, regardless of the not-so-perfect picture quality--I would not have paid Cinefear $70 to buy Abby on VHS tape. Also, I can understand why people are upset over the shoddy DVD, especially if they paid $20 to $30 to get it. I gave an extra star just to be able to see Carol's performance again as Abby. The comments made by the previous reviewers were right on the money concerning the actual movie. I will always remember the line, ""I don't need you, I've got Abby!""",1129248000,11,2276,4.475845410628019
1920334,1,B0000D0YX9,"Abby is something of a cult classic inspired by The Exorcist (1973).  It features an excellent cast led by William Marshall, Terry Carter, Carol Speed, and Austin Stoker.  The basic premise is scholar and minister Garnet Williams (Marshall) travels to Nigeria to work on an archaeological site.  During the trip, he inadvertently releases a Nigerian demon which proceeds to possess his daughter-in-law, Abby (Speed).  She soon manifests self-destructive and anti-social behavior and ultimately ends up in a mental hospital.  After she escapes, she begins to prey on men in nightclubs, using promises of sex to lure them to places where she can destroy them.  Eventually, Garnet, Abby's husband Emmett (Carter), and her brother (Stoker) must confront them demon and try to force it out of her before she perishes.

The film is absolutely based on or inspired by The Exorcist.  Though there are many important differences, there are also a number of similarities that could be argued are derivative of the original work.  This is presumably the basis of the Warner Brothers litigation that essentially killed the film.  Regardless, this is a well made, well presented film that treats the subject matter and the actors with seriousness and respect.  Despite being often classified as blaxploitation, the film lacks many of the stereotypes of the genre.  Horror film fans should give it a chance.

Now for the awful DVD.  Normally I don't do reviews here, but this DVD is so appalling as to almost be beyond words.  The video transfer is so poor that the opening credits are almost unreadable.  Not one moment of the video is clear or devoid of massive flaws.  The original master, if indeed an actual film master was used, was in decrepit condition.  The audio, though poor, is slightly better than the video.  The so-called extras are worthless.  The DVD is not worth purchasing at any price.  It might be worth renting, but only if the viewer absolutely must see this otherwise difficult-to-find film.

At the time this review was submitted, there were two glowing reviews of the DVD.  Both touted its high quality and superb extras.  Lies.  No reasonable reviewer can reach this conclusion.  In case you doubt this, consider this one point.  Both of these glowing reviews were submitted on the same day...December 14, 2004.  Don't believe 'em.  The DVD is absolute garbage.

With this said, the film itself is quite good.  It absolutely deserves a complete and caring restoration done by a reputable company.  My 1 star rating applies only to the Cinefear DVD.  The film itself warrants 4 stars.",1126396800,20,2596,5.004683840749414

Aside from the film which is a lot of fun and not a ripoff of the Exorcist as many have claimed, there are a ton of extras including a detailed history of the film, a theatrical trailer, a radio spot, lobby cards and poster art, as well as an Easter egg which can be found ..., well you'll have to find that for yourself!

This is without a doubt one of the best independent label releases of the past year.  The transfer on this DVD is just fine, I have seen larger companies release DVDs of more popular films that don't look nearly as good as this.  Furthermore, this film having been lost for so many years, we are lucky to have as good as transfer as this.  Unfortunately, DVD has brought out the perfectionist in people, and these very same people seem to believe that unperfect films should now appear perfect on DVD, which is unreasonable.

Anyone interested in a rare lost film as Abby, should pick up this DVD and treasure it.  The people who released this DVD did so out of love of cinema.",1102982400,3,1158,4.408450704225352

I think that her character improves tremendously once the possession takes over! She goes from meek and unhappy to someone who knows how to have some fun.

Watching Abby transform is hysterical. Some must see scenes include the fried chicken scene, the church choir scene, and the car scene where she gets a little ""rough"" with her prospective lover. This movie is one hundred times funnier than the so called comedies that are out nowadays.

Carol Speed, the actress who plays ""Abby"", probably gave the acting performance of her life in this film. The late, great William Marshall who acted in such blaxploitation classics as ""Blacula,"" gives a commanding performance as Abby's father-in-law who combats the demon to save Abby's soul.

This DVD version released by Cinefear has many fun extras, including the original trailer, a radio spot advertising the film, and tons of lobby cards, rare production stills, and a poster gallery. There is also an extensive history of ""Abby.""

The quality of the transfer is very good.  It is very clear and there aren't any digital blips or stops in the picture like I have seen in many DVDs I have gotten that were released by big name studios.

I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who has any interest in horror, blaxploitation, or just wants to be highly entertained for 90 minutes. Watch this movie and see why movies made in the early 1970's are the best.",1102982400,2,1732,4.795302013422819
