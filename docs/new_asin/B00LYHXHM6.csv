6516176,1,B00LYHXHM6,"Notice it says, ""A Phantom of the Opera"", not ""The Phantom of the Opera"".  Oh, it is just terrible.  Just terrible.  Don't waste your time.",1419897600,3,139,4.48
6516177,2,B00LYHXHM6,"Ok, so being a huge Phantom of the Opera fan I was really intrigued by this movie plus, I love Nightmare on Elm and especially Robert Englund. But the problem with that was: Where the f**** is Robert in this entire film? FALSE ADVERTISEMENT.
And don't get me wrong, I want to like this  move. I feel like the people who made this has at least some love for the books, but by God where they misguided. I'll give you a rundown of pros and cons for this move.

Pros:
-The Phantom. Holy crap. He does a phan-tastic job with line delivery and intensiveness.
-The music is pretty awesome in some scenes.
-Adding parts and characters from the book that for some reason where left out when making its way onto the screen.

Cons:
-Why do the flashbacks have to be in black and white? I really feel like they didn't have to go full black and white. Oh and someone should have checked everyone's makeup (CHRISTINE I'M LOOKING AT YOU) to make sure it looked good on camera.
-Some of the casting, namely Christine. Holy crap I know this is a low budget film but wow...
-The song the Phantom wrote for Christine felt extremely out of place. It sounded much too like something that someone would write now a days for some side-project musical. (I get that they probably worked very hard on it, and honestly it doesn't sound bad! I really like it, but it just sticks out like a sore thumb. My suggestion would be to listen to more music from that time period to get a better understanding of how to let that inspire you.)
-The line delivery for some characters felt like they just got the scripts the day of shooting.
-The dialog for quite a bit of the flashbacks felt extremely choppy and not at all like actual conversations. This may have been why the actors sounded as strange and over doing it.
-The lighting. Oh boy.
-I hate the fact that they tried so hard to make Charisma/Christine a nerd. Like really? She couldn't have been your average girl. Besides she's supposed to be all ""pure"" and ""innocent"". Have you met many ""nerds""? I can't speak for all of them in the world, but every ""nerd"" I know is extremely twisted with a dirty sense of humor. They are wonderful people.
-The Phantom's makeup. He's supposed to be disfigured, but damn. The Persian looks worse than him. I really feel like since his face is supposed to be terrifying, it should have been better thought out and executed.
-That ""plot twist"" at the end. I CANNOT describe how much I loathe it when people are like ""Oh hey, I know this one thing is cannon, BUT I'M GOING TO DO SOMETHING ELSE SO EVERYONE WILL THINK I'M EDGY!"" At points I feel like obviously they read the book or at least footnotes of it, but for the love of it all, WHY?! Who thought this plot twist was a good idea?!

CAUTION: This has spoilers! So please, if you don't want this to be totally ruined stop reading now.
I feel like because I have read the book, that ""plot twist"" is totally and utterly ridiculous. First of all, if you have read the book you will quickly become aware of how NOT fatherly his feelings are for Christine. He only pretends to be her father at times to trick her so he can get closer to her. I get it, you guys want to retell the story. Sure, put it in a different time and change a few names that's okay. But WHO acts that way to their DAUGHTER? No, I feel like the people who wrote this script had seen the movie, and/or read the book/footnotes and completely missed what the story was about. It isn't just some creepy guy in a mask that is obsessed with a young girl. It's much more than that....

Overall, I would say watch at your own risk. I didn't mind it, but at times the bad acting and the clunky writing really had me cringing. I'd say watch it to see for yourself. Who knows, maybe watching too many Cinema Sins has turned me into a snoot.",1419379200,10,3807,4.326330532212885

6516179,4,B00LYHXHM6,"So,Is there a genre devoted to The Phantom ? We only ask because there seems to be alot of them over the years and well,This is one of my Top 3  The musical (played by everyone),Phantom Of The Paradise and Anthony DP Mann !

Why,Would I pick this one as a top 3,Well ending was original and Anthony knows he is not Gerard Butler, And doesnt have to be in this screenplay.

The Christine is from a reality show that discovered her as The Christine for this movie,How AWEsome is that ?

Story is told sometimes in flashback,But thats okay,Because the Black & White scenes explain alot.",1417996800,2,583,4.420560747663552

6516234,5,B00LYHXHM6,"This version of ""Phantom of the Opera"" is very well produced,and acted. The music by Andrew Lloyd Weber was enthralling!. He has done such a catching theme to the accompanying music, that fitted beautifully with every act. The music and production, plus the choreography, made this movie the best version of any other ""Phantom of the Opera"" done before! This, of course, is my personal point of view and opinion, because I love musicals. I should say, that many od my friends agree with me.",1439856000,,490,4.776470588235294

6516236,1,B00LYHXHM6,"This was, hands down, one of the worst films I've ever watched.  The script is bad, the acting is terrible (seriously, there are cereal commercials with better acting), the cinematography is a nightmare, and worst of all the music is dreadful.  Come on!  The music is central to any Phantom telling and this just blew... Also, it's kind of important to disfigure the Phantom, not just have some ""scars"" drawn on with what looked like eyeliner and silly putty....",1438214400,2,462,4.822784810126582

6516238,3,B00LYHXHM6,"I was okay, and was actually enjoying this movie until I got to the end...  That plot twist kinda ruined it for me, I gotta say.  Other than that, it was entertaining enough.  I liked how they mixed the present day in with the past, since I'm sure many Phantom phans have dreamed that they, themselves could be a part of the story as well.  Strong work (except for the end).  Some things just shouldn't change!  ;-)",1430697600,,415,4.324675324675325

6516241,4,B00LYHXHM6,Solid effort. I also didn't have a stroke while watching. 4 stars,1427500800,,65,4.5
6516242,2,B00LYHXHM6,"I appreciate that they tried to make a serious film, but the amateur performances really sink it. Also, when the Phantom's ""hideous"" face is revealed, it's a pretty pathetic makeup and a real letdown.",1420156800,3,200,4.911764705882353

8669015,4,B00LYHXHM6,"This is perhaps the most unique version of Phantom that I've ever seen. I'm surprised it's gotten as much hate as it did. So it's different from the original, classic retelling. So what?! I liked the twist. It might not be the best quality, but the quality doesn't always interest me. If you want something different from what you'd normally expect seeing a version of Phantom of the Opera, this is it. If I say any more, I'd be giving away spoilers.",1519862400,,450,4.5
8669016,2,B00LYHXHM6,"I can forgive a lot of issues with this film; it's an indie film and I know making a movie is tough, but there is only so much disbelief that I can suspend.

The filmmaker has a love for Phantom and his many incarnations and we can even see a love for the horror genre. There are even good-to-OK performances, but the editing is too choppy (e.g. not staying on a shot long enough or by letting a good moment go to waste because they cut away to the next shot to soon).

The other gripe I have is the Phantom's makeup; it was underwhelming to say the least. It was reminiscent of the 2004 version, so don't expect much. The last thing I'll say without any ""spoilers"" is this: the Erik and Christine relationship is complicated enough as it is. You don't have to know the Phantom fandom to understand this. So my problem is why do film makers insist on adding more layers of issues to their relationship, when it adds nothing to the story. Nothing changes except that things get weirder for the characters and the viewer and at the end of the film; you're left with more questions, like plausibility and why would anyone do this?

If I go on I""ll end ""spoiling"" the film, so I'll say no more.",1519862400,,1190,4.303571428571429
8669017,2,B00LYHXHM6,"I agree with the vast majority of viewers who felt that this attempt to update the classic Phantom of the Opera to modern times failed miserably. Virtually everything about it is bad, the plot and acting. I disliked it so much that after watching more than half of it, I had to turn it off.",1502928000,2,290,4.290909090909091

8669022,1,B00LYHXHM6,"The only reason I saw this movie through to the end is because I kept hanging on to the futile hope that maybe it would get better. Alas,  it did not.  This is not only the worst take on the Phantom of the Opera that I've ever had the misfortune to witness,  but I do believe that it's also the worst movie I've ever seen period. That's saying a lot coming from me since I'm usually a very tolerant and open-minded Phan who enjoys seeing different interpretations and spins on the classic tale.",1478390400,6,494,4.290322580645161
8669023,5,B00LYHXHM6,"As a Phantom fan, as well as a fan of horror and independent films in general, I absolutely love this one. The cast is well done, the creepy atmosphere is there and while it may not exactly follow the Gaston Leroux novel that much, it certainly does draw more elements from the book than most adaptations as well as previous film incarnations, such as the 1943 Claude Rains and 1989 Robert Englund versions. A must-watch for Phantom of the Opera fans!",1476144000,,451,4.580246913580247
