8235036,5,B000Z7OTH8,"Rev. Davis taught the folk revial how to fingerpick.  No better way to get into it than to take a master class from one of his disciples. Ernie Hawkins, who studied with RGD, takes you through these songs in a clear and concise fashion. The songs range from 'old-fashioned picking"" (now folk classics) like Candyman and Cocaine to  straight blues to rags.  A bonus is original footage of RGD at work.  Challenging picking techniques for the aspiring player.",1387756800,2,457,4.82051282051282
8235037,5,B000Z7OTH8,Ernie not only learned from this Master directly but teaches the Rev. in a manner that anyone can follow. You can not go wrong with Ernie Hawkins DVD lessons they are all excellent. Money well spent.,1319846400,2,199,4.555555555555555
8235038,5,B000Z7OTH8,"This DVD is worth buying even for those who are not interested in actually learning the songs, just for Ernie's performances. I bought this two months ago and am already playing a couple of the songs. I never thought I could get this far. Also, there are priceless insights into Reverend Davis that are worth it alone. I am tempted to buy this for others in my family.",1216598400,4,368,4.426470588235294
8235039,5,B000Z7OTH8,"the bottom line on this two DVD set is that Ernie Hawkins is a gifted teacher.

Well known for his talent, more important to the purchaser of this DVD (as well as his CAGED System and other DVDs) is his ability to communicate to his students.

Similar to Homespun DVDs, these are also high quality DVDs and focus well upon the fingering with close ups. Like all gifted instructors, Hawkins anticipates where a student will stumble, and is patient in going over the material.

If you love acoustic blues, you'll love this set.",1213747200,4,525,4.623655913978495
