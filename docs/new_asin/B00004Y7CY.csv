1372632,4,B00004Y7CY,"This is a german movie with english subtitles. The settings are a small rural town in winter and portrays 4-5 major characters who have miserable lives in one way or another and their paths will cross each others later on. The whole winter scene, snow, naked trees and darkness has really given this movie a sad overtone. The characters are all powerful and contribute to the story line, especially the poor farmer who is searching for the killer of his daughter.
The story has some happy moments here and there and are well integrated in the story line.
I can't tell you much otherwise it will ruin it for you in case you haven't seen it yet.",970444800,3,643,4.504273504273504
1372653,5,B00004Y7CY,"...much better. No question that Lola is a great movie, but turn off the soundtrack and it might get boring. This reminds me one of O'Henry's stories. Winter Sleepers takes it from a different angle. Not how the things might come if we miss by a minute the train or the bus, or if we take right or left. Winter Sleepers is deep. It tells you of what happens to us,is a reflection of how we behave in life itself...And we strugle to remember things we've done, to find explanation,no wonder!",1066348800,8,490,4.395604395604396
1372654,3,B00004Y7CY,"I don't know what it was, perhaps the copy I saw was horrible, it was a VHS and it looked horrible, even though it was an original it looked like a copy of a copy of a copy of a copy. But this has to be my least favorite of his films. The shots were boring, the story was slow, and I suppose I was comparing it to much to ""Run Lola Run"" with all it's flare and beautiful color.
But by the time it ended, the story captured me. The ending (which I'll try not to give away too much) was great. I heard this was one of hte films that inspired Memento. Tykwer sure knows how ti find those intricite stories and bring them home.
SO if you love his work, you must watch, but make sure you have a DVD copy. If you didn't love ""Princess and hte Warrior"" you won't like this, if you are expecting another ""Run Lola Run"" I suggest you run the other way.",1057622400,5,843,3.935672514619883
1372655,4,B00004Y7CY,"The creator of 'Run Lola Run' has more goodies in his bag with this tale of intertwined lines of fate.  The story was engaging and the gritty european sensibility, once again, a refreshing respite from the slickness of most major Hollywood productions.  It reminded me a little of Andy Warhol's 'Bad' - as it's not so much a story about anything in particular as much as it's a story about what happen's to the characters as they go about their lives and some rather difficult stuff happens.
Again - I love Tom T's work - it's very well crafted, everything in it is obviously very considered yet plays quite naturally.  The suspension of disbelief is easy and there's always something about the characters that gives you a fresh perspective about life and people to consider.
The picture on the cover is somewhat misdirecting - the scene from which it is taken is actually not a comfortable, cozy time for lovers.
When it was all over, I was kind of hoping that this was just episode 1 of 10 - the story and the same - or different - people could have gone on for much longer and still maintained my interest.  But that's what a Tom Tykwer movie does for you.
PS: T.T.s 'The Princess And The Warrior' is another AMAZING movie, slicker and newer than 'Winter Sleepers' but more good stuff from this great director.",1033344000,4,1313,4.5508474576271185
1372656,5,B00004Y7CY,"Beautiful scenery in this movie.  Director Tom is brilliant when it comes to cinematography.  Great story about a group of people, some of which know each other, whose lives are all somehow connected.  If you like Run Lola Run, then you'll like this one.",1025395200,,254,4.7272727272727275
1372657,4,B00004Y7CY,"Winter Sleepers... if one hasn't guessed by other work by Tykwer that he loves to explore and deconstruct a ""moment"", to watch the ripple effects from seemingly random encounters, this film will cement arguements on what his auteur paradigm is.
As a piece of cinema, Winter Sleepers is engaging in its eliptical nature. Camerawork, acting, story (except the denoument) are top-notch, the production design and color schema are intriguing, too. Perhaps not Tykwer's best work, but still well worth repeat viewing (my standard for a DVD purchase) -- and heads above the vast majority of American Independent cinema.",1005868800,2,613,5.26530612244898
1372658,2,B00004Y7CY,"Due to the success of his second film, the international smash hit, ""Run Lola Run"", Tom Tykwer's first feature, which had until now only been seen in Europe, has been dusted off and trotted out onto the North American DVD market.  Although I'm usually a sucker for Kieslowski-esque ruminations on coincidence vs. fate, I found this film to be emotionally sterile, albeit flashily so, which was also my opinion on the much overrated ""Run Lola Run"".  The film no doubt recalls Altman's ""Short Cuts"" and P.T. Anderson's ""Magnolia"" (although the latter was released after ""Winter Sleepers""), but that's giving the film too much credit since Tykwer's stories and characters are nowhere near as compelling.  Specifically, two of the three interconnected stories did not hold my interest.  The only story I had fun watching involved the aimless and destructive relationship between Marco and Rebecca.  However, that's only because of the delicious performances from Heino Ferch as the boorish but handsome and sexy lothario, and Floriane Daniels as the needy but beautiful sexpot, and not because of their connections to the other two stories in service of Tykwer's overreaching theme.  The blandness of the story involving the father and his comatose daugher is the most problematic since it fails to deliver what is ostensibly the emotional core of the film.  But this film does show Tykwer to be a flashy and distinctive filmmaker, qualities that has since made him an international star.  The sequence at the end of ""Winter Sleepers"" is particular impressive although I really don't see how it adds to the story.  Tykwer has proven to be a technical wizard, now he's got to prove that he can tell a good story.",1002067200,4,1707,5.024822695035461
1372659,4,B00004Y7CY,"I have to start by saying that Tom Tykwer is my new hero.  All three of his movies (Winter Sleepers, Lola and Princess) are centered around the same basic themes (love, fate, death, you know the drill) but still manage to be wonderfully unique and interesting.
This is not the movie for someone who wants to see Run Lola Run Redux.  Maybe not the movie for someone who thinks this is a followup to Lola (yeesh).  But this IS a lovely film, filled with memorable characters, GORGEOUS cinematography and an interesting plot.  These aspects alone put it head and shoulders above a lot of what is being produced these days anyhow.
I guess the bottom line would be: buy the movie on its own merits, and not on expectations.  There is a beautiful yet unsettling calm at the center of Winter Sleepers that sucks you in, but only if you give it a chance to.",995328000,7,849,4.451612903225806
1372660,4,B00004Y7CY,"I'm not sure what I expected when I snatched ""Winter Sleepers"" off the shelf at the local Blockbuster. I know I didn't expect what I got, though. After a pulse-pounding action masterpiece like ""Run Lola Run,"" Tom Tykwer must have decided to tone down his action muscles and start exercising his drama talents. ""Winter Sleepers"" is one of the best foreign films I've ever seen, filmed with Tykwer's manic style and passion for atmosphere, yet with a hint of Atom Egoyan's love for plot twists. This is a film that Egoyan (my personal favorite director) would've loved to make, but Tykwer took it, shook it up, and he did it right.
The film begins with an almost totally silent introduction that sets the tone for the entire movie with its lovely overhead shots of the snow banks and the musical score playing. Each character is unveiled in long panning shots and small captions. The movie's pace moves along rather slowly for about five minutes, and then POW! A car crash that results in the incapacitation of a little girl, and triggers a father's need for revenge. Then Tykwer grabs ahold of the reins and let's her rip. The relationships between the characters in this movie are so carefully constructed and so keenly developed that by the end of this film we realize that if just one of them were to not exist, it would completely alter the outcome of everyone else's lives. Just like Atom Egoyan. Because this is a Tom Tykwer movie, it has a faster pace than a movie Egoyan would've made, but it is because of that that it is not as good as an Atom Egoyan movie. Egoyan loves giving us the time to contemplate while we watch the film. Tykwer gives us that time too, but he also loves distracting us with his camerawork and one too many shots of nudity. Sure, sex is one of the demonstrated evils in this film, and some of the shots do have a point to them, but most do not. Egoyan would've vetoed those shots, I'm pretty sure. But let's pull up the carpet and get down to brass tacks: ""Winter Sleepers"" is an extremely entertaining, powerfully written, acted, and directed film. It held my attention from its rather slow beginning all the way to its heartstopping end. Tykwer may be meant to make action movies, but ""Winter Sleepers"" shows us that he can do other stuff, too. Just not as well as Atom Egoyan.",985910400,8,2312,4.546762589928058
1372661,3,B00004Y7CY,"Something tells me I have no clue what I'm talking about when it comes to this movie. Still, the only reason I rented it was because it's by the director of Run Lola Run which was an incredible movie. And it simply didn't deliver. If you want more of the same, wait for Princess and Warrior - or maybe for Bourne Identity with Franka Potente coming out in May 2002.
The sheer obsessiveness with coincidences displayed in this movie is tiring. It may be pretty... but it's not entertaining.",983664000,3,489,4.50561797752809
1372662,4,B00004Y7CY,"As a devout fan of ""Run Lola Run"" I was excited to learn of ""Winter Sleepers"", Tom Tykwer's film that proceeded ""Lola."" While this film doesn't have the frenetic pace of Lola, it almost matches it in it's thoughtful examination of fate, love, death, chance and the odd coincidences of life. I guess that just about covers it, ehhh? This is a film that moves at it's own pace that gradually draws you into a world that you can't quite figure out; that grudgingly reveals it's mysteries only to those who look very carefully. The story involves the overlapping lives of several initially disparate characters in a small village; people who would never think that their future could be determined by people they've never met or can't remember meeting. In fact, it raises the question, ""Do we have any control over our fate, and if not, who does?"" If I needed only one word to describe it I would choose ""haunting""...I first saw the film about a year ago and still find myself thinking about it occasionally...it has a way of getting under your skin...well, at least, mine. I highly recommend it.",977961600,4,1092,4.692708333333333

7926879,4,B00004Y7CY,"Winter Sleepers is a film that still haunts me years after having first seen it.  Set in a ski resort town in the Bavarian Alps, I recall first its beautiful aerial shots and second its beautiful actors costumed in color coded wardrobes, one always red, another always in soft forest green.  Literally filmed sleeping often, but figuratively sleeping while awake, the characters remain unaware of common touch points in their lives.  Like other films: The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie by Bunnel and Hanna and Her Sisters by Woody Allen, it is painful to watch the narcissism which unfortunately provides a clear picture of contemporary society for reflection.",1310342400,,664,5.12962962962963

7926884,5,B00004Y7CY,This is the film where you can watch Tykwer in action before he even understood his style. Nothing is as sharp as Heaven or the Princess and he indulges himself in whatever formal style he feels is appropriate to the scene. It's like the best film school class exercise I've ever had. He is remarkable.,1120003200,3,302,4.509090909090909
7926885,4,B00004Y7CY,"Before Tom Tykwer created international hit ""Run Lola Run"" (or ""Lola Rennt""), he created the ponderous ""Winter Sleepers"" (or ""Winterschlfer""). Like Tykwer's later films, this one deals with fate, destiny, death, and love. It's an interesting execution, with a flawed climax and the occasional question of ""where is this going?""
Laura (Marie-Lou Sellem) arrives at her little country cottage, where her pretty friend Rebecca (Floriane Daniel) lives. Things are complicated after the first evening: while handsome but loutish Marco (Heino Ferch) is in bed with Rebecca, a strange man (Ulrich Matthes) wanders over and takes Marco's car. But when he is driving, he causes an accident that puts a child in a life-threatening coma.
The child's father (Josef Bierbichler), stricken with grief, goes on the hunt for the man who accidently killed his daughter. That man, Rene, is now in love with Laura, but can't remember anything about the accident. Rene is also inadvertantly causing cracks in Laura and Marco's fragile, tempestuous relationship. One person will die -- two will find happiness -- and one will find freedom.
""Winter Sleepers"" has a lot of the same themes and feel of Tykwer's later films, but more unpolished and loosely knit together. Though we know the fates of all these people are interconnected, much of the screen time is devoted to Laura and Rene's blossoming romance, or Marco and Rebecca's deteriorating one, and not to the central theme of the movie.
The cinematography is breathtaking, with a lot of Tykwer's signatures like a camera panning in a complete circle around Rene, and a character death never being shown except by a thud and darkness. As he often does, Tykwer filmed many scenes in a portentous manner, as if every tiny event could start off something important. Perhaps the biggest problem is the conclusion. While beautifully filmed, it seems out-of-character and a bit of an easy way out, as if Tykwer wasn't entirely sure how to end the various interconnected storylines.
One thing that Tykwer does well is give humanity in subtle ways to the characters, even the stupid, cheating Marco, who is genuinely miserable and guilt-stricken after his girlfriend falls off a ledge. Matthes is instantly sympathetic as the sensitive, memory-impaired Rene. Daniel and Sellem are quite nice in their roles as, respectively, the sexpot and the quiet wannabe-actress nurse.
""Winter Sleepers"" lacks the tightness and focus of Tykwer's later films, though his good directing style is still present. However, those looking for an interesting philosophical drama/romance might want to check it out.",1072051200,12,2619,5.223277909738718
