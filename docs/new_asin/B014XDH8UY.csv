8732188,1,B014XDH8UY,"This version is a compressed version. Picture quality could be better. A few parts freezes. Will pay more for a better version next time.  Also, being a collector, this version was plainly packed in plastic sleeves. I prefer the digipak, booklet versions.",1478390400,,255,5.071428571428571
8732189,4,B014XDH8UY,"It starts off well and kept my interest up to the 18th episode. The writers didn't have a good balance though, of when to end it. Instead they let the bad boy scenes go on and on, making the main female characters and the police force into stupid people. I didn't buy the change in the bad guy's character, trying to make him seem like a good guy at the end, and they never explained the loyalty of his right hand man, to the point of murder, arseny and helping him to escape imprisonment. All of the actors were convincing. I wish the writers had spent more of their creativity, making positive peaceful scenes, especially after the rescues. Also, I thought it was poor judgement to dress the billionaire's son, in shirts that were either too big or too small or that his suit jackets were always too small. That was just tacky. The actor deserved better. I gave it four starts because they kept my interest from beginning through most of the episodes. It's not a drama that I'd wish to own, but I'd go back and see parts of it again.",1453766400,2,1035,4.367875647668394

The fashions are great.  The actors funny but this one is a more intense story than the ones I've seen and I like it.",1450224000,,254,4.06
