Best of Deathmatch Vol. 5- Double Death Tag Team Deathmatch Tournament
Technically speaking, this is not the Best of Deathmatch. This is a show that IWA Mid-South put out a night after their Queen of the Deathmatch tournament, which is available on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Best-of-Deathmatch-Wrestling-Vol-4-Queens-of-the-Deathmatch/dp/B000MTFFOA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Best of Deathmatch Wrestling, Vol. 4: Queens of the Deathmatch</a>. I have never really been a fan of Deathmatch wrestling, but IWA-MS really makes me hate it through the works of this DVD. This is the Double Death Tag Team Tournament, which means it's a Tag Team Deathmatch tournament that you must eliminate both your opponents to win. What you get is almost an entire DVD of crap. Not all the matches are that bad, despite them not being my personal taste. It's just that the DVD itself drags along like a turtle with a gunshot wound. People take ten minutes getting to the ring. After every match we have to hear a long, drawn out interview from the wrestlers in the match. You are practically screaming at them to hurry up and start wrestling. I'd also like to point out that the crowd consists of around 40-50 people, so you can hear everything the wrestlers are saying during the match. That is one of the key factors that ruins this show.

Sexxxy Eddy & Jagged VS Mitch Ryder & Chuck Taylor
This was the only match of the night that was part of the Double Death Tournament. Chuck Taylor doesn't have a partner, but Mitch Ryder comes out to save the day and be his partner. Sexxxy Eddy is quite a character to watch. I'm not sure what Jagged's gimmick is supposed to be. Regardless, these 4 put on an average tag team match.
RATING- 5/10

First Round DDT Matches-
Tables, Ladders, Chairs & Light Tubes Steel Cage Match (Match of the DVD)
Drake Younger & Ian Rotten VS Diehard Dustin Lee & Vortekz
This is one of the better matches of the evening. Drake Younger and Ian Rotten were put together on the spot but work together well in this match. It's basically a beat down of Dustin Lee and Vortekz. Light tubes lost their effect after the first one is broken. Younger does hit a great elbow drop off the cage and then a Vertebreaker.
RATING- 7/10

Barb Wire Boards & Bar Room Brawl
Necro Butcher & Toby Klein VS Hugh Rogue & Chuey Martinez
Necro Butcher and Toby Klein are two of the better Deathmatch wrestlers. The match itself features a couple good spots that keep this above average. Butcher uses Rogue's back as a dartboard. There are two good barbwire spots near the end as well.
RATING- 6.5/10

Taipei & **** That Hurts When You Get It In Your Cuts Deathmatch
Insane Lane & Freakshow VS Dysfunction & Corporal Robinson
Yes, that is the real name of the match. A Taipei Deathmatch is when you have glass glued to your fists and you match is usually a big punch out. Around the ring are lemons, salt, and other crap that hurts when you get it in your cuts. It's ridiculous, but has a good spot at the end at least. Insane Lane throws up all over the ring.
RATING-4/10

Electrified Light Tubes Match
Mad Man Pondo & 2 Tuff Tony VS Jacob Ladder & Darin Childs
This match is such crap. There are four light tubes in each corner that are plugged in and lit. This sounds interesting, but it's not. Ladder sets himself on fire, which looks more stupid then cool. The Light Tubes being electrified makes no difference at all. Pondo and Tony are horrible wrestlers, and they brought the match down considerably.
RATING- 2/10

Semi Final DDT Matches-
Fans Bring the Weapons Match
Ian Rotten & Drake Younger VS Necro Butcher & Toby Klein
Well, at least you can say that the fans brought some creative weapons to the match. Ian uses a glove with thumbtacks all over it. The match itself is boring and a letdown. Butcher and Klein could do a lot better.
RATING- 2/10

Fans Bring the Weapons Match
Dysfunction & Corporal Robinson VS Mad Man Pondo & 2 Tuff Tony
This match was a big improvement over the last match, but it still had its bad spots. Again, the fans have brought some extremely creative weapons to the show. The match has its boring spots just like the last one, but they aren't as bad as the last match. Pondo almost burns the ring to the ground with a fan created weapon.
RATING- 4/10

Final DDT Match-
No Roped Barbed Wire, Caribbean Spider Web Death Match
What are the essential elements to your general Deathmatch? Light Tubes. Barbwire. Cacti. Wait...what? That's right, this match features cacti. The match starts off really slow and doesn't really do much until the first two eliminations. After that, you get a couple good spots and a crappy ending.

8184520,5,B000OCZ2ZC,"Jagged and Sexy Eddy vs Chuck Taylor and Mitch Ryder-  This was a match that wasn't part of the Tag Team Deathmatch tournament. This started out with a great promo, and a nice moving match. However we saw a quick ending and a heel turn which sort of ruined the match. Grade B-

Lee and Vortekz vs Old and Younger- Very good match, we saw many hard hitting moves, uses of tables, chairs, glass, a ladder, light tubes, and a cage. You will see some fantastic high spots. Grade A-

Hugh Rogue and Chuey Martinez vs Necro Butcher and Toby Klein- We didn't see as much of the high flying like last match, we did however see a bar room brawl. Nothing like seeing a guy used as a dartboard. Necro and Toby have been in much better matches. Grade C+

6 ft under vs Corporal Robinson and Dysfunction- Both teams went all out and we saw a blood bath. Not only was this a brutal match, but they tried use some high flying moves, and some scientific holds along with some weapons! Grade A-

Mad Man Pondo and 2 Tuff Tony vs Children of Pain- Brutal, can that just some it up? One of the moves is just crazy, insanely crazy! Grade A

Old and Younger vs Necro and Klein- This was amazing. Necro and Klein went all out, and hit the other team with everything. In was a very close match, because both teams had some much experience. Why is Toby and Necro barefoot with all the tacks and barbwire? Sick finish. Grade A

Mad Man Pondo and 2 Tuff Tony vs Corporal Robinson and Dysfunction- The ring was on fire after some fireworks exploded. It's amazing how many fantastic matches are on this DVD. Again both teams are left bloody and bruised. It's amazing anyone survived. Grade A

Mad Man Pondo and 2 Tuff Tony vs Necro and Klein- Barbwire ring ropes, glass, tacks, tables, exploding mines, fire, and a bunch of weapons get ready for a war. Grade A

Just another amazing DVD. I can't wait to see more IWA mid-South, because these guys put on so many amazing matches. It's hard to believe anyone survived in the matches that I saw. Overall Grade A",1198713600,3,2030,4.33509234828496
