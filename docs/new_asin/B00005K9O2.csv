1618045,4,B00005K9O2,"It's great to see Jet Li doing what he does best,and these films reflect that. I'm not a fan of his Hollywood fare. The only problem I have is in the film transfer. It's quite bad by today's standards. I found the Wu tang Clan's release of Yuen Woo Ping's `Shaolin Drunkard' to be of a top calibre standard. It also has 5.1 sound and tons of extras. Maybe the big boys can take a page from them.....",1018310400,,399,4.128205128205129
1618046,5,B00005K9O2,"Jet Li rises to a level only rivaled by Bruce Lee in the China series.  I am not usually a hard core Kung-Fu fan, yet as soon as I started watching the series I couldn't stop.  We finished the movies in one sitting which unfortunatelly started at 9 pm on a week night.  Sleep is important, but try and put this series down...  Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon looks silly when stacked up to these classics.  Great plot, captivating story(especially if you stop to think about what was really happening in turn of the century China), and fight scenes that put the Matrix to shame all add up to a classic that is a must for any one with a DVD player, much less Kung Fu fans.",1007337600,15,669,4.277777777777778

The OUTC series are excellent movies, with lots of action, showing Li's capabilities and the films offer excellent plots, with nice photography, impressive locations and top-of-the-line production. The DVD format offers excellent picture quality, with subtitles in spanish, english and french (it is difficult to find spanish subtitles in HK movies), and the sound quality is perfect (except for the Part 1, which is mono) with Dolby Digital.

I watched the first and second films, and never viewed the third.

the last pretty much sums up my view:  i didn't view it.

1618107,5,B00005K9O2,This is a classic starring Jet Li at the early part of his career.  It was a bonus to add all three volumes at once.,1225324800,,116,3.64
1618128,5,B00005K9O2,"This is a bit of a renaissance-man-film, if one can say that. It does a lot of things simultaneously. Firstly, it is a great kung fu flick, with some of the best names in the buisness including of course Jet Li, the inimitable Yuen Biao as well as Yuen Wo Ping of later Matrix fame. Secondly, it is a big, well told drama about doctor Wong Fei Hong, a real life character and something of a Chinese folk hero, and the modernisation/changing of Imperial China some hundred and a bit years ago. If you took away the fighting, it would still be a good film, a very rare thing with martial arts films. Thirdly, it is a great opportunity to see how the Chinese themselves (if ""only"" the Hong Kong Chinese) look upon their own history and their own heroes. That particular time in Chinese history, in which ""Once Upon a Time in China"" plays out, is not only tumultuous and chaotic, but the actual transitional period between imperial and repulican China.

It is well acted, wonderfully directed, beautifully scored, and a blast to watch. Definitely one of the best films ever to come out of Hong Kong.",1218931200,,1095,4.53030303030303
1618129,5,B00005K9O2,"First off, buy the ""Once Upon a Time in China"" Trilogy, not Collection.  Collection has far more technical issues than the Trilogy.  Unfortunately, since Amazon groups all of its reviews, there's confusion as to which version is being referred to.

Second, there are 6 movies in this series.  The first 3 are the ones to focus on (and the ones sold in this package).  4 and 5 don't star Jet Li.  Number 6 (Once Upon a Time in China and America) stars Jet Li, but has a different director (Sammo Hung) than 1-3 did (Tsui Hark, HK's Spielberg-some would argue) and is, at best, mediocre.

The OUATIC series is about the adventures of Wong Fei Hung, a Chinese folk hero.  This character pops up a lot (as a child in Iron Monkey, Jackie Chan's character in the Drunken Master series).  Each portrayal is very different and most aren't based but on the slightest detail to the actual historical character.  But that aside, here's what the movies are really about:

Yes, Jet Li's character struggles with a HK overrun with British Imperialists and the woman who loves him and all the drama that follows and. . .honestly, no one really cares.  The story is an odd mix.  When there aren't action sequences, much of the story plays out like a routine period piece.  The story is decent and worth a look, but subsequent viewings will have you simply skipping ahead to the action sequences because. . .

. . .these are simply the best collection of HK/Kung Fu/Wire Fu fight sequences you will ever find.  You have an actor at the top of his kung fu game with choreographers who are given a lot of freedom and creativity to use the actors talents, all captured by a director at the peak of his powers.  These fight sequences are the stuff of legend, the yardstick that all kung fu fights are measured against.  Not to take anything away from other flicks of Jet's like Fist of Legend or Fong Sai Yuk, but these are the best.  And to get them all in one package for such a cheap price is nothing short of criminal.  I paid a small fortune to get these three films from HK before this version was released.

You'll see some of the most innovative and intense wirework, skill, and choreography you've ever witnessed, stuff that makes the Matrix look tame by comparison, despite coming out years before the Wachowski's ever put word 1 to paper.  Every scenario you can imagine is captured, Jet vs. 1, Jet vs. some, Jet vs many, Jet with weapons, Jet with bare hands, Jet with props=like an ubrella, Jet vs. flaming arrows, Jet vs. boss characters in the most insane environments you can imagine.  I can't stress it enough, this is as good as it gets.  Even skipping over the story, the fight scenes will entertain you and your next several generations long after you're gone.  Simple as that.  If you're into Kung Fu flicks and somehow have slept on this one, just buy it.",1216598400,5,2856,4.529296875

1618132,4,B00005K9O2,"This is a classic trilogy for fans of Jet Li and/or period Kung Fu. Jet Li is 'wong fei hong', a legend in China. As is common for this genre, there's quite a bit of slapstick humor in the first movie. The second and third movie may seem better if you're not so into the clowning around. As usual, Jet Li's kung fu is truly impressive, although the wired choreography is a little annoying at times.

All in all, well worthwhile for anyone interested in (period) kung fu movies or simply admiring Jet Li's talent!",1173052800,2,512,4.389473684210526

1618134,4,B00005K9O2,"All three movies in this trilogy, when the martial arts is concerned, are great! Really there are. Jet Li, as usual, performs amazingly.

Alas, the movies also try to integrate some cheap comedy and kitsch romance into the movie, and that doesnt mix well, if you ask me.

1618135,1,B00005K9O2,"If you want UNCUT ORIGINAL version, ALWAYS look for ORIGINAL LICENSED Production. NOT US Release. Its a foreign film, it should not be US version to begin with~! HELLO!!!?? Why settle for LESS with US Version where they edit and cut so many excellent scenes especially with Jackie's Fighting Scenes. And US Release ruins the speed and sound as well. I have been collecting JET Li movies both HK and US Release Version for quite some time now. I found HK Version to be MUCH MORE in enjoyable, and HIGHER in Quality. American Market always like to ""Americanize"" and ""Control"". Regional Code Regulation thing is one of the example to CONTROL the Market. Why not let everyone enjoy the same HK Original Release move the same way REST OF THE WORLD enjoys it ?? No one makes Hollywood American movies to ""French version"" or ""Chinese Version"" ~!

1618136,4,B00005K9O2,Great action flick except this particular DVD is only in Chinese with English subtitles. Great for the purest in the crowd but killer for those of us who like badly dubbed English dialogue. Better off buying the single disc if you need English.,1137456000,6,244,4.6976744186046515
1618137,5,B00005K9O2,"The Once Upon a Time in China Trilogy is a great way to get 3 great Kung Fu movies at once. I won't review them all seperately but will give a general review.

All 3 are Imaginatively choreographed with Jet li (Wong Fei Hung) flying high.

Great epic stories of currupt government officials with some great fight sequences. The picture and sound quality isn't too bad and the English subtitles are pretty well translated.

This is a highly recomended series",1122940800,4,457,4.6875
1618149,3,B00005K9O2,"Having seen the first two movies on digital cable, I can say that they are great movies, but the DVD transfer quality really suffers on the 3-pack.  Scenes alternate from blurry to clear with visible digital artifacts.  The only scenes which are crisp and clear seem to be when there is little or no movement.  If you don't like the movies, the video quality is bad enough to be distracting, and if you enjoy the movies then you deserve to buy a different version.  I hope that the discs offered individually have better video quality.  5 stars for the movies, 2 stars for the video quality of the transfer.",1111104000,56,607,4.532110091743119
1618150,1,B00005K9O2,"These 3 movies are indeed landmark movies in Chinese Cinema and definetly for Jet li and Movie Kung fu.

However, I watched 10 minutes of te first movie on this compilation which DOESN'T have english Subs ( I don't mind, but every other DVD I have ever seen has this )

Also, in the first ten minutes, there have been 2 incredibly bad awkward translations. For some reason, Cousin Yi is now Aunt 13 and Chu's bird is now Chu's Beard. This is Crap. Do NOT buy this, buy the movies seperately, you can probably find them each for 9 bucks, and they would be more satisfying that way.",1107043200,17,580,4.3119266055045875
1618151,4,B00005K9O2,"Expect a liberal dose of everything you generally do from a martial arts flick -- slapstick comedy, overly melodramatic subplotting, and, on occasion, even a hint of a story.

All that aside (which is how I am sure the director saw it) the balletic, intricate and often incredible stunt work during the action scenes is an absolute treat. Jet Li's utter disregard for human limits is evident as he turns in a surprisingly measured yet kinetic performance, nothing like his forgettable Hollywood yawns.

The subtitles for this Mandarin-language effort are a bit difficult to read, since the English is in small print below the more prominent Chinese subtitles. But when the action kicks into gear, forget them and just watch the graceful choreography of the fight scenes.

Notably notable in the three installments:

PART-I:
A mind-blowing hook-and-ladder battle, plus a terrific umbrella sequence.

PART-II:
The climactic fight with Donnie Yen. The speed and technique shown during the double-pole fight is staggering; Yen's moves with his cloth staff left me gob-smacked.

PART-III:
This one clearly suffers and is even borderline skippable. The final fight scene at the lion-dance competition is a colorful pageant, but lacks the impact of the one-on-one fights in the first two films, mainly because the participants are all wearing giant lion head masks.

All in all, can't go Wong with this purchase.",1100736000,10,1405,5.217777777777778
1618152,4,B00005K9O2,"This is almost like Indiana Jones, but the Chinese version. Lots of adventures, with funny bits thrown in as well.

The first 2 is the best (my favourite is the 2nd one with Donnie Yen) but I bought all 3 to keep, as it is hard to find them in local stores anymore. The only thing I liked about part 3 is the introduction of ClubFoot - one of the newest student of Wong Fei Hong. His style of fighting, with his 'demon feet' as his strength, is really captivating.

The triology have audio in Mandarin and Cantonese, which is hard to fine. The English subtitles are pretty good - so I can watch with all my non-Chinese buddies. Picture quality is quite good, sound quality is ok (minus 1 star) - on some parts it looks as if the words are coming out before the mouth moves, but this is not a big glitch. Overall, I am very satsified having bought this trilogy collection.

Unless you need to collect every Jet Li movie I would pass on this set. I think the first movie is worth buying singly though. It is very complex and unique. It will put you in a different dimension while watching it. But the 2nd and 3rd are so boring that I couldn't stay awake no matter how hard I tried. If you don't buy this set you will be missing nothing. However, try to pick up the first movie, it is very decent.",1089158400,5,556,4.018018018018018
1618154,1,B00005K9O2,"Jet Li is a fine martial arts stylist and an adequate actor but this film is typical of the slap-dash, juvenile style of film making practised by the Asian film industry.
Everyone character in it is based on some firmly held, narrow-minded perception of the world.  Noble peasants, corrupt officials, Pure-hearted heros.  The evil white guys are especially grotesque:  Big Noses!  Facial Hair!
Bad table manners!
Sure, Western films have been guilty of awful anti-oriental bias but there's no way a movie about the ""Yellow Peril"" could be released today without riots breaking out.  As long as the bad guys are white, racism is OK.

The praise for this racist, silly, poorly made film is mystifying.  It comes from people who are evidently easily mezmerized by frenetic visual activity being passed before their eyes.  They can sit still for this far longer than the rest of us who can find more important things to do with our time like fold socks, do our homework or almost ANYTHING other than watching this film!",1085702400,5,1015,4.8604651162790695

1618156,5,B00005K9O2,"If you thought Jet Li products like ""The One,"" ""Black Mask"" or ""Cradle 2 The Grave"" were great films--you don't know what you've been missing. The ""Once Upon A Time In China"" plays like like an underground version of mainstreamed US releases, including ""Crouching, Tiger."" It's hardcore kung fu, with little fantasy, a good dose of history, and grimy, all-out, no-holds barred fighting.
The 6-part series (of which Li only appears in the first three, and the sixth) follows Wong Fei Hong, a doctor long renowned in Chinese legend. The setting is in late 19th century China as issues of colonialism, and suspicion toward foreigners runs ramapant. Fei Hong is usually neutral, with stronger leanings toward anti-westernization. Villains often play the part of the complete anti-westerners, doing any and everything to kick the French or British out. In the pro-west corner is Aunt Yee (aunt via a distant relation it seems, which lessens the weirdness of the romantic tension between her and Fei Hong) who dresses ""modern,"" takes pictures with a camera, and believes the future lies in assimilating more of the western form into the culture.
Fei Hong is caught in the middle. He is extremely proud of his country and its people, but knows there is some merit to Yee's belief. For one, as a doctor, he has seen and understands some of the more efficient medical methods of the West, and knows that they surpass some, but not all Chinese methods. He fights both overly zealous Chinese and foreigners who don't mind making murder and brutality part of the process.
The Yuen Wo Ping choreographed scenes could make up a manual for shooting the kung fu fight scene. The cuts are long, extended takes, from numerous angles, with only splashes of slow motion. Wire work takes precedence over CG EFX (there aren't really any), and the fights are fast and furious, with few dramatic pauses where the fighters glare at each other, etc. You will see some of the most clever and awe-inspiring fight scenes ever caught on film.
One fight in the first volume takes place in a multi-story barn where Fei Hong battles Iron Vest Yim atop ladders and hay bales, using the ladders as if they were his feet. In the second, more historical volume, there are amazing sequences against Donnie Yen, it top ""Iron Monkey"" form, and a fight against the White Lotus sect where winning the battle is only half the fight: both fighters are at the same time trying to stay atop tables, ledges or people, as long as they don't touch the ground.
It's a definite must-have for your collection, and if its the start of your collection, you'll be drawn to his other pre-mainstream films as well. Note that his assistant Fu changes from volume to volume (Yuen Biao sets and is the standard as Fu in Vol. 1) but this is a minor, although slightly irritating side issue. The fights are mind-blowing--""Crouching, Tiger"" without the intimations of love, fantasy, magic or slow motion. Just drawn-out street fights in the true fight-to-survive mindset.",1055030400,38,3008,4.85408560311284
1618157,4,B00005K9O2,"My wife and I are HUGE Jet Li fans! We currently own EVERY Jet Li movie currently available on DVD. (Yes, that includes all the Hong Kong DVDs) If you're unfamiliar with the 'Once Upon a Time in China' series (henceforth referred to as OUATIC), it is fantastic! The action is astounding, and the acting is very good for Honk Kong cinema. It's the continuing story of Wong Fei Hung, the storied doctor and martial arts master of the Boxer Rebellion era, and one of the fabled 10 Tigers of Canton. If you are new to Jet Li movies, or Wu Shu/Martial Arts movies in general, then this is a fantastic series to start with. Now, with that said, the question remains....why did I only give this 4 out of 5? It's simple.  This is billed as THE 'OUATIC' collection. Well, not quite. The entire series to date has 6 installments. Now granted, OUATIC 4 and 5 do NOT star Jet Li, but OUATIC 6 (Once Upon A Time in China and America) DOES mark the return of Jet Li to the series.
