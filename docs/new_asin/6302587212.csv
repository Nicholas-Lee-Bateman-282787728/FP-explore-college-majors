7828836,5,6302587212,"I did not receive this product for free or at a reduced price for my REVIEW: I purchased this video after reading a review of it written by writer/internet extraordinaire ""Seanbaby""; Dirty Line Dancin' is hilarious.
For approximately 30 minutes, host/instructor/mumbler/epileptic John Douthitt grunts, thrusts, mumbles, stumbles & ""teaches"" you how to perform - and I'm quoting from the box - the ""Sleazy Slide"", ""Dirty Tush Push"", ""Trashy Women"" & the ""BC Slide"".
I don't care for country music (or dancing) and this is the video I show to anyone who asks me why.",1461974400,2,564,5.01063829787234
7828837,4,6302587212,Product is as described.  I haven't watched it yet but assume it plays ok.  Looking forward to giving this as a gift.  I haven't yet decided who the lucky person will be.,1317254400,,170,4.25
