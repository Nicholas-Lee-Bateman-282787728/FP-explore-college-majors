8047221,5,B0007GP6RY,"Like his books, so I got this on that basis.  But it's just him walking around, waving his hands, and talking about his past work.  Adds nothing new.  He is a bit self-congratulatory but in certain instances (e.g. exposing the hidden hand of Bill Ayers in Barry Soetoro's literary output) Cashill deserves our gratitude.  As such, I am only too glad to help support his efforts by purchasing this DVD.  Just know that this is no full on production.",1386115200,2,448,4.620253164556962
8047222,3,B0007GP6RY,"This DVD is an interesting lecture. While it contains information that needs to be explored further, perhaps it would have been better for Jack Cashill to write a book instead. About 90% of the DVD contains footage of Jack Cashill lecturing, while the cameramen frequently change the shot angles in an effort to make it more interesting. This documentary would have been more believable had Outpost Pictures taken the time to include more film footage and interviews with the investigators and eyewitnesses mentioned. At any rate, this DVD contains about 89 minutes of summaries of events that took place mostly in 1995 and 1996. Forgotten by many people is the fact that John Doe #2 disappeared after the Oklahoma City bombing. Also covered was the fact that the FBI ignored 270 eyewitnesses who saw something flying toward TWA Flight 800. Remember Sandy (Burglar) Berger, who stole and destroyed documents from the national archives? The Olympic Park bomb, Ron Brown's plane crash, and the possibility of ""Operation Eisenhower,"" which Richard Clark opposed, are all mentioned and weaved together in a conspiracy which the Clinton administration allegedly created to save Bill Clinton's candidacy. I recommend this DVD for anyone who desires to know more about these events. Had this documentary contained a great deal more footage with Jack Cashill narrating, I would have given it at least four stars.",1209340800,2,1404,5.18942731277533
8047223,1,B0007GP6RY,"I was disappointed with the rather superficial rationalizatons and assumptions made in this DVD which deals with how we got ourselves in the ""fix"" of Iraq. Blaming Clinton, for example. The rationale behind this presentation is that the neocons are correct. I don't even agree with this assumption let alone then going back and putting the blame for this debacle on Clinton. I am no Clinton fan (he sold his true democrat values early on in his stint, and is at best a luke-warm repblicrat), but it seems this documentary goes out of its way to pin it all on Clinton, giving the Bushes and the neocons a pass on every level. The documentary assumes, for example, that the official story relating to 9/11 (The 9/11 Commission Report)is true. However, it only takes a few hours of respectable research for any thinking adult to realize how flimsy the official 9/11 story actually is. This is in no way addressed in this documentary.  I do not consider it well enough documented in its assertions and claims to meet my high standards for criticism.  Intending no offense to its author, I would not recommend this documentary.",1168300800,7,1122,4.778350515463917
8047224,5,B0007GP6RY,"None of the other reviewers get it.  They let their political bias influence their objectivity.  Political ideologies should not dictate the security of our Republic.

Jack Cashill's Mega Fix details the actions taken by the Clintons to turn their terrorist investigations into postive political gains for themselves.  After the Democrats lost their majority in both houses of Congress in 1994, Bill Clinton feared he'd also lose his bid for re-election in '96.  So for the next two years (and the four years there after), Clinton and his FBI tricked (lied to) the American people into believing the terrorist attacks on our country were home-grown and not Islamic in origin.  Clinton's denying the terrorists their due and his actions to blind our security agencies of the threat (and anything he had done illegally) lead to the attacks on 9-11.

This film details a very important, but ugly truth of the Clinton Presidency. Every American should watch this film to understand how our Republic has been damaged.  Jack Cashill should be applauded for bringing this story to light, and I believe time and history will prove him an American hero.  Watch and learn why our nation was so vulnerable on that September morning.  Ignore Jack Cashill's story at your own peril.",1166313600,7,1269,5.028708133971292
8047225,1,B0007GP6RY,"This is quite possibly the worst thing I have ever seen on DVD.  This guy, who is extremely boring, stands there and talks about this whole big conspiracy, citing ""the internet"" as his all authoritative source.  The way it is filmed is extremely annoying and consists of nothing but this guy in front of a dropcloth with two or three cameras that walk back and forth, zoom in and out, filming him.  There is no footage of anything he talks about.  Maybe it would be OK just to listen to but even that is a stretch.  Don't waste your money.",1146182400,17,539,4.35
8047226,1,B0007GP6RY,"This tape is horrid.  My wife and I couldn't finish watching it, so if it did get better after the first half hour, I wouldn't know.
Basically this is one guy, standing in front of a dropcloth talking about an alleged conspiracy about terrorism. His premise is, that the Clintons basically set the ball rolling for 9/11 back when they were in office.

Unfortunately, the camera work is straight out of a high school year book production.  He drones on for a while about how he became the 'custodian of a great story'.  He tells a lot of stories (most of which had nothing to do with anything), and he tries at every turn to belittle Democrats (or maybe it was liberals in general).
""haha, the liberals are so stupid, they compared Newt Gingrich to Hitler.""
""haha, the liberals are so stupid, they refuse to believe that Vince Foster didn't commited suicide"".
He says all this in a manner that is so smooth, that I instantly was wary of what he was saying. Add that to the partisan attacks and I couldn't get through the first half hour.  Don't waste your time.  There are good documentaries that cover both sides of this debate, but this isn't one of them.",1120521600,17,1156,4.507177033492823
8047227,1,B0007GP6RY,"First, the good news. Mr. Cashill presents some accurate and shocking information that every American should know, particularly a portion of the abundant evidence that TWA Flight 800 was brought down by a missile. However, you can get that information elsewhere for free, in much greater detail, and with supporting documentation so you have a good reason to believe it, rather than simply believing it because some guy on TV/radio told you so.

The bad news is everything else about this DVD. I have no idea who Jack Cashill is, but he sure does spend 90 minutes trying to make sure you learn who he is. It seems more like a grand play to join the big leagues of talking heads than a legitimate... I hesitate to call it a ""documentary"". Either way, it was almost impossible for me to pay attention to what he said, for a variety of reasons:

1. A huge amount of effort seems to have gone into designing a unique ""style"" for Mr. Cashill, so that you would remember *him* more than anything he actually said. For example, his sleeves were unbuttoned, but not rolled up. Doesn't quite have the flair of the Carl Sagan's turtleneck/sport coat combo, or the irreverance of Michael Moore's sloppy bum look, but at least it's unique.

2. Mr. Cashill sounds like he has read books like ""How To Win Friends and Influence People"" and ""Speak and Grow Rich"" more often than Billy Graham has read the Bible. His speaking style is so deliberately designed to evoke trust and emotion that... well, I just can't trust him or get very excited about anything he says. He mentioned having a radio show, so this may just be the result of years of broadcasting in a forum where viewers cannot adequately challenge anything he says. Either way, it's really annoying.

3. The content is schizophrenic, combining shocking facts (which you can learn elsewhere), undocumentated assertions, and personal opinion into what Mr. Cashill clearly regards as the one and only way things really happened over the past decade. He even tells us what went on inside the White House during times of national crisis. Did he bug the oval office, or is he just *guessing*? In fact, he even calls himself the ""custodian of a great story..."". It's difficult to take that seriously.

4. The cinematography is embarrassing to watch. The camera jumps and bounces around, and switches viewpoints and angles like a heavy metal music video. Completely inappropriate for a monologue where Mr. Cashill claims explain why thousands of people have lost their lives over the past decade. They even cut once in a while to show the cameramen filming him, for no good reason at all.

5. Mr. Cashill clearly has some kind of agenda that doesn't include love for Bill Clinton, or Democrats in general. I personally couldn't care less about the Democrat or Republican cults, but whenever someone in one of those groups is totally preoccupied with trashing the other, you're not likely to an objective viewpoint. The sad thing is, he's probably not far off in his basic assumption that Clinton's political ambitions led to tragic mismanagement and cover-ups of terrorist investigations. However, he doesn't mention that the same is true for every other recent president, including the fellow sitting in Clinton's old chair at the moment.

6. The DVD doesn't even have a main menu, let alone special features that might substantiate a few of his claims. This is sad because there *is* documentation for many of his claims. But no one should believe anything just because a guy or gal on TV said it is true, and without documentation that is exactly what they are asking you to do.

7. Worst of all, the camera operators focused on Mr. Cashill's crotch a little too often for my tastes. I really didn't need to see that.

If you are not susceptible to propaganda and manipulation you might even get some good food for thought out of this DVD. But for most people I'd recommend alternative media that presents more documented facts, and less theory about how those facts fit together. This DVD is essentially a televised radio monologue of one man's conspiracy theory, which can be entertaining enough, but not very enlightening.",1109462400,24,4166,4.815384615384615
8047228,1,B0007GP6RY,"THIS THING IS BEING HAWKED AS A DOCUMENTARY WHEN IN REALITY IT'S NOTHING MORE THAN SOME SO CALLED ""EXPERT"" STANDING IN FRONT OF A CAMERA WITH WHAT LOOKS LIKE A BEDSHEET AS A BACKGROUND DOING A 90 MINUTE MONOLOGUE.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. I'D GET MINE BACK BUT I TOSSED THE RECIEPT.",1109289600,18,280,4.509803921568627
