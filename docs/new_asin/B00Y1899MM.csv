7207322,3,B00Y1899MM,"The video itself is fine, but the presentation of the package is a little lacking. Most Bay Area fans have seen 3 trophies from baseball and have purchased the blu ray copies for each championship. The case itself is of a cheap DVD knockoff variety. The disc itself and the video are fine.",1440892800,2,289,4.471698113207547

7207333,2,B00Y1899MM,"MLB releases a boxed set that includes every game of the World Series and the NBA releases a ""highlights"" DVD? What a waste. I would gladly pay more for a full boxed set.",1452470400,6,170,4.181818181818182
7207334,3,B00Y1899MM,"I wanted to like this so badly.  Growing up in the 90s, the Bulls were my favorite team and fortunately won 6 titles during that time.  I faithfully bought every single championship video and enjoyed them immensely.  With this Blu-ray, it started with some historical referencing and told a good story but missing from this was any real actual basketball action.  A lot of what I saw was also from different angles and slowed down, which I felt did not really add to this video.  When I want to see real highlights from the season, i just go to youtube.

One thing that I feel that the NBA has really missed out on is releasing the entire NBA finals on Blu-ray.  I purchased the latest version when the Giants beat the Royals and you not only got every game, they included all the audio tracks - the nationally televised version plus each of the local radio announcers.  I think that was a phenomenal idea because I for one would have loved to watch the finals again listening to Jim Barnett give his insight.",1450051200,15,1009,4.475409836065574

7207339,3,B00Y1899MM,"The NBA should take a look at the excellent World Series blu-rays and take notes. I realize this is a condensed version of the events, but so many key storylines are glossed over or completely ignored. They barely go into how bad of a slump Curry was in and don't mention Klay's concussion scare and the list goes on and on. And don't get me started on the bargain basement packaging. This should have been so much better.",1443657600,9,422,4.423076923076923
7207340,5,B00Y1899MM,Great video,1442966400,,11,5.0
7207341,5,B00Y1899MM,"To be honest, we had stopped paying attention to pro basketball until we stumbled into a Warrior game on TV early last season.  Wow!  This was different, and really fun to watch.  Not just the long range shooting by Curry and Thompson, but the whole team dynamic.  It was clear that these guys had the same ""glue"" that has made our SF Giants so much fun and so successful.  So we were hooked ... all the way through to the happy ending of a long-awaited championship.  And to sweeten it more, our local NBA D-League team, the Santa Cruz Warriors, won a championship too!  This DVD does an excellent job of presenting the highlights of a memorable experience following this wonderful collection of players and coaches through their championship season.  it even has footage of the Santa Cruz Warriors playoff, which we attended!  So it's all good memories and good fun as far as we are concerned.",1442793600,7,895,4.649681528662421
7207342,5,B00Y1899MM,"I've been following the Warriors since Mullin was drafted. There were so dark days in between, and I never thought I would see the day that they would win a championship. Great video for all the long suffering fans.",1442534400,,215,4.538461538461538
7207343,3,B00Y1899MM,"Not exactly a GREAT team season highlight video. In my opinion it was rushed, could have had a few more statistical references on the team or individual players. I'm a Warriors fan and was able to watch almost every game this season and feel they could have included a few more clips. I'm only comparing this to other ""highlight"" dvd/blu rays I've seen from other teams. I've been waiting for a championship since we had Latrell Sprewell, Chris Gatling, and Chris Webber.",1442448000,5,471,4.7560975609756095
