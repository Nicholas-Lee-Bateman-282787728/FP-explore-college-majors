But I guess that's just how the show goes.  Definately do not let the video run after it's over.  The music at the end is annoying.  Good, clean entertainment for kids.",1179878400,2,309,4.1525423728813555

2719174,5,B000M343C6,"Another SpongeBob DVD.....oh yay!

And I mean that in the best way possible.  Who else could entertain my 3 year old, my teenage son and my suit and tie wearing husband?  Nobody but SpongeBob, Patrick, Mr. Krabs, Sandy and Squidward.  SpongeBob is the sweetest, most innocent nerd ever.  Patrick is the bestest friend a sponge ever had.  Mr. Krabs is hilarious as the money-grubbing boss.  Sandy, well, I haven't figured her out yet.  And, Squidward, the lovable foil to all of SpongeBob and Patrick's adventures.  We own all four seasons of SpongeBob and have it playing on one of the television in our house at all times, literally.  Seven new episodes....I can't wait.....to surprise them all when it arrives.  Shh, it's a surprise.  Tarter sauce, I have to wait a few more days.  It will be a wait well worth it.  Everyone enjoy!  Ahoy!!",1176768000,6,841,4.743055555555555

8165967,5,B000M343C6,"If you're looking to avoid buying entire seasons of Spongebob, this video is a good way of doing it.  It allows you to get several good episodes that generally center around a theme - this one involves the constant battles between Mr. Krabbs and Plankton for the Krabby Patty recipe.  My children got several laughs out of this DVD.",1199232000,,332,4.610169491525424

They live for Spongebob, Patrick, Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Gary, Sandy, and Mrs. Puff.

But I don't and can't blame them really; Spongebob is a catch and from time to time, the show itself is actually quite funny. It all takes place at Bikini Bottom, a town underwater, away from most sharks and beneath all the humans who dwell on earth. From time to time, Spongebob and Patrick make it a rare habit to come up out of the water, and take a looksee around. Immediately, they puff up like Mrs. Puff, Spongebob's driving teacher. He never learns how to drive successfully either. He's no good in that department, and should stick to the Krabby Patties!

Anyway, I'm gonna describe and then rate all of the characters and then rate a few aspects of the actual film:

Spongebob Squarepants: Very silly, upbeat and so nice to everyone that is nice to him. Even if you're mean, he tries to see the good in everyone. My second favorite character. A

Patrick Star: Super goofy and kinda spaced out, he's basically Spongebob's right-hand man. His personality, while goofy, consists of being nice to Spongebob but he tends to have an anger spout here and there. An OK character. B-

Squidward Tentacles: Another keeper, character-wise. He's the moody, selfish and very negative critic of the series. Many enjoy his company, especially Spongebob, but funnily, Squidward doesn't feel half the happiness when around the yellow sponge. He'd rather have his hands around his neck, doing the unthinkable. B+

Mr. Krabs: Very work-oriented, and a decent man who tries to instill the work ethic into Spongebob and Squidward also. Spongebob follows, and Squidward carries on, as if Mr. Krabs said NOTHING. Not one of my favorite characters. C-

Gary: My absolute favorite! I can't really pinpoint a true-blue personality to him, but he makes cat sounds, is usually quiet, which leads me to believe that he's an introvert as opposed to an extrovert, and loves Spongebob till the ends of the sandy ends of Bikini Bottom. A+

Pearl Krabs: The whiny, big-headed whale-daughter of Mr. Krabs. She's so ridiculously spoiled that I would slap her if I was an imaginary fish, residing in Bikini Bottom. She's not a bad character, and is usually super-dramatic. B+

Sandy: Level-headed and sweet, Sandy is nearly as friendly as Spongebob. Get on her bad side though, and she's unafraid to show you a piece of her mind! B

Mrs. Puff: She holds one of the absolute worst jobs in Bikini Bottom; trying to teach the unteachable Spongebob to drive! She goes crazy every time she spends 5 minutes with him, and for very, very good reason. A-
