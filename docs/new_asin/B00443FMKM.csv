4259436,5,B00443FMKM,"I saw Ashland's Oregon MacBeth a few years ago and it was brilliant.  A wonderful stage production.  I've seen MacBeth live a few more times as well (including seeing it at Ashland some 28 years ago).

HOWEVER, I have never seen any video/movie/tv version of a Shakespeare play that so well captures the true play.  Henry V via Kenneth Branagh is the only thing that I can say is comparable in scope and scale.

After seeing Patrick Stewart's  MacBeth on PBS a few weeks ago, I appreciate the play better than any other time I have seen it in my 51 years on this globe.

4259438,5,B00443FMKM,"This is the best version of this play you will ever see.  Patrick Stewart has grabbed the crown.  I have seen Macbeth numerous times and because I know it by heart I expected little in the way of anything new.  I was wrong.  This version is outright spooky, scary, and unsettling.  There are shocking touches such as one of the witches pulling out a war wounded soldier's heart. You may never trust a ""night nurse"" again. The unbelievable intensity of Lady Macbeth will screw you to your seat and give you nightmares.  Her sleepwalking moments will take your breath away and make you squirm.  New,  fresh, dynamic and awesome.  I was wondering how this production would pull off the ""porter"" scene.  It was raw and disgusting - just the right touch for this adaptation.  No comic relief here, unless you are a psycho.  All of the other Machbeth's may go home now.  You are no longer needed.",1286755200,104,890,4.592356687898089
4259439,5,B00443FMKM,"I have seen both live and filmed versions of Macbeth over the years, but none made a greater impression than this version that I caught on PBS on Wednesday, October 6. I was going to watch the first hour of Macbeth--a story I knew well--and then turn to another program, but I couldn't turn the channel because I had been ineluctably drawn into the drama and era. The play is set in late 1930s or early 1940s fascist Europe. Scotland is a fascist country similar to Italy and Germany of the time, and is at war with democratic England. Film clips of fascist Italy and communist Soviet Union are used to portray the armies of Scotland. As happens in fascism and militarism, affairs between leaders are often settled by murder and assassination in particularly brutal ways. The setting is similar to the 1995 version of Richard III staring Ian McKellen that was so effective with the late 1930s militaristic uniforms, automobiles, and settings.

To say this Macbeth is excellently acted is an understatement: the acting and elocution are terrific, that of Patrick Stewart as Macbeth and every single other character. Every word is completely discernible. The costumes, scenery, and staging are also spectacular. For three hours I watched with complete attention and fascination--I literally could not turn away from the drama on the screen. After Macbeth has decided to go over to the dark side at his wife's urging, the staging has frequent moments of impending menace and dread, such as when he matter-of-factually prepares ham sandwiches while he instructs his assassins about how to murder Banquo and his son. Others include the impending murder of Macduff's wife and children, Lady Macbeth's horrifying visions during her sleepwalking scene, the hilarious and disturbing impromptu dance to a Russian folk song that the guests use to unsuccessfully alleviate the dread and tension during the banquet scene, and the three weird sisters portrayed as preternatural witches in the guise of malevolent military nurses.

The entirety of the staging, scenery, and direction is completely thought out to make this an inspired, effective, and completely engrossing drama. The terror in Macbeth becomes palpable and some of the images will remain with you. I will certainly buy the DVD when it becomes available and I encourage readers to do so also. This will surely become the standard Macbeth on DVD.",1286668800,43,2395,5.0761421319796955

4259441,5,B00443FMKM,"I just finished watching Rupert Goold's film of Macbeth, starring Patrick Stewart and Kate Fleetwood.  As mentioned in the last post, I saw this production on Broadway and was eagerly awaiting the film version.  Now I've seen a lot of great film Macbeths, including the Ian McKellen/Judi Dench version, the RSC film with Antony Sher, and Roman Polanski's.  This film is the best Macbeth that you will ever see.  In fact, scenes that I didn't find very effective on stage (Lady Macbeth's mad scene and and the long scene between Malcolm and Macduff) were very powerful in the movie.  Patrick Stewart's performance is definitive.  You can see every thought that passes through his mind.  Kate Fleetwood's Lady Macbeth charted her fall into insanity with such clarity that when Macbeth is told that she has died, it's no surprise to him or the audience.  You see that there was no other end to her story.  The Weird Sisters, here played as Nurses who have gone over to the dark side, are truly frightening.  There is no weak link in this cast, the directing is thrillingly original, and the production design is stunning.  It easily could have been shown in movie theaters.  This Macbeth is set during the Cold War of the 1950's, and doesn't shy away from the shocking violence of a dictatorship.  Characters are brutally executed, and the murder of Lady Macduff and her children is greatly disturbing, even though you see almost nothing happen.  And to top it all off, Rupert Goold has the film end with the camera panning from location to location throughout the castle (the dining room, the kitchen, the Weird Sisters' morgue) and then closes with a shot of Macbeth and his Lady in the elevator, hand in hand.  So we end with the idea that Macbeth's castle isn't just drenched in blood.  Now it's haunted.",1286496000,219,1805,4.755627009646302
4259442,5,B00443FMKM,"This is a modernized version of Macbeth set circa World War II, and much like the Ian McKellen Richard III, it has modern weapons and fascist overtones for the title character. It basically keeps Shakespearean dialog, though in a few instances the dialog is either rushed, or hard to understand over background sounds. That is pretty typical for modernized Shakespeare productions, where the emphasis is more on emotions and ambiance than strictly on the words.

That said, the acting and directing were first rate, and the set choices worked well with the general sense of the production. Patrick Stewart is superb as Macbeth, and Kate Fleetwood is excellent as Lady Macbeth. There was almost a 'rap' cadence to some of the dialog from the witches, but that kind of fit. A few shots seemed to have either archival or faux archival WWII footage, but again that worked. Making Macbeth a fascist dictator was effective and made sense, though some Shakespeare purists might not be happy with that choice.

I saw this on PBS on Great Performances and was quite pleased. Even the 'minor' roles were well done. You can enjoy this without being 'in love' with Shakespeare.",1286409600,12,1165,4.908629441624366

They also simply like that the film is in color -- many students struggle to watch a black and white film. This interpretation is so good, I even watch it when school isn't in session.",1472428800,3,373,4.5
4259454,5,B00443FMKM,"Directed by Rupert Goold from a previous stage adaptation of his, Macbeth (2010) was initially broadcast on a television channel operated by the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), and is an unsettling and disturbing rendition of the tragic play by William Shakespeare. This is not to say that the television made movie is badon the contrary, I thought the undertone of menace and dread in many of the scenes only served to enhance the story; it made it rather akin to a horror movie (especially with the supernatural elements) or a psychological thriller worthy of the silver screen. I am not usually one for such movies, but I can certainly appreciate the overall effect it all had and was surprised by just how much I enjoyed it. The film stars Patrick Stewart as the lead character, Macbeth, who begins as a courageous yet ambitious man that is driven to ascend the throne by a trio of witches known as the Weird Sisters that deliver a prophecy that he will one day rule. Lady Macbeth, portrayed by Kate Fleetwood, is the scheming and conniving wife that encourages her husband to pursue his ambitions through any means necessaryincluding murder.

The movie is listed as part of the Great Performances series, a telecast on the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS), and it is no wonder why because this was certainly one of the greatest I have ever seen. Stewart simply delivers an electrifying performance in this movie. It was raw and powerful, even a little frightening at times, and riveting in cold tyranny as he succumbs to both power and madness. I have always enjoyed Stewart as an actor, but this has to be my favorite performance of his for the sheer presence he commanded. Fleetwood is just as captivating and delightfully unhinged as Lady Macbeth, managing to bring a vulnerability to the character that accentuates the callousness of her husband. Although faithful to the original source material, this adaptation deviates by setting it in an era reminiscent to the Cold War of the 1950s. I think this is what attributes to much of the disquieting ambiance in the film, especially since a lot of the environment is staged similar to an unembellished morgue or a hospital.

Goold certainly did not shy away from using some disturbing imagery either, resulting in a lot of intense, violent, and bloody scenes of warfare, murder, and executions. It was admittedly difficult to watch in some places, but just as hard to look away from. Interestingly enough, I didn't find these scenes to be excessive or unnecessary; instead, I thought they only served to emphasize the brutal nature of Macbeths dictatorship even more. This film was not what I expected at all, though I have to admit that this interpretation of the play surprised me and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The entirety of the cinematography, the staging, the scenery, and the acting made it all wonderfully dark and dramatic. While this adaptation might be an acquired taste it is still definitely worth watching, especially if you are a fan of eerie thrillers or dramatic horrors. I am a bit disappointed that it is currently unavailable here on Amazon Video, though it seems as if the DVD is obtainable. Hopefully, this will change in the future, because I do recommend watching this. If all else fails, Macbeth is currently available to watch on the PBS website for free too (which is how I watched it). It is only available until February 2017 according to the webpage though, so I suggest watching it soon before it is too late.",1471305600,,3505,4.8595317725752505

4259461,2,B00443FMKM,"Ok just watched this version of Macbeth for the first time and it was a severe disappointment.  I am an avid Shakespeare fan and am not at all against using different settings and time periods but this one is preposterous.  I found myself actually laughing out loud at some of the settings and character choices.  There are so many flaws I don't know where to begin.  The whole play is set in tunnels like Neverwhere which makes the whole Birnam Wood thing not work.  I have to draw the line at having MacDuff's family living in a seedy girl's locker room.  The witch's are now nurses who never really leave the stage much and are lurking about.  Their scenes are silly and ineffectual.  For one thing you can barely hear what they are saying and they look like something out of The Ring.  I keep waiting for them to climb down the walls like Samara.

Kate Fleetwood as Lady Macbeth is insane from the first shot.  She plays the role over the top all the way. No subtlety at all. She is evil out of the box much like the Lady Macbeth in the Orson Welles version.  Patrick Stewart is Patrick Stewart so he puts on a fine performance despite the questionable directorial decisions.  Several actors are doubled up on roles which is understandable on stage but here it just muddles the mix.  I don't want to have to wonder if that is actually just the same actor or the same character.  The guy who plays the porter who answers the door for MacDuff is horrid and he's supposed to be the comic relief.  Instead he comes off as a psychopath.

The choice to turn Macbeth into Joe Stalin complete with propaganda posters is reaching for something it never quite attains.  There really is no parallel between the two.  I had no idea it was supposed to be Russia till well into the film.  Kind of kills the whole Scottish thing.  It's funny in the only real outside scene where the Macbeth's are wearing silly Russian hats.  To innumerate all the flaws in this production would take hours.  All I can say is it's a good laugh - only problem is it isn't supposed to be!  It tries too hard to be different and innovative and because of that it is an epic fail.  I lay the blame for this comically bad production firmly on the shoulders of director Robert Gould.

Ok so I'd be remiss in my job if I didn't at least try to find something positive to say...hmmm...Patrick Stewart is in it.

If you want a modern adaptation of Shakespeare that really resonates go watch Ralph Fiennes' excellent version of Coriolanus.",1464739200,2,2501,4.451541850220265

4259463,4,B00443FMKM,"Macbeth is one of my favorite Shakespearean tragedies. This version seems to be from the full text, because there are scenes I've not seen in any other film version of the play. Patrick Stewart is excellent. His Macbeth is somewhat reluctant to take the first step to becoming king, but later embraces his villiany. Kate Fleetwood is also very good as Lady Macbeth who moves in an arc the reverse of her husband. The setting is somewhere like Stalin's Russia in the 30's, although everything remains Scottish. The weird sisters are also an interesting touch.",1463961600,,558,4.88421052631579

Lady Macbeth was limited, Ross was quite good (though he seemed to have wandered in from another play), and Macduff's reaction to learning his family was dead was very moving and real.

You lose the essence of MacBeth as master and lord.  Yet it highlights the idea of everyman being his own master and lord.  This is a thoroughly modern conceit not reasonably suggested by the author or the original play.  It is only arrived at because you know the original... thus diminishing this production because it relies on elements outside of the play to make it work.  Casting the witches as nurses is a bit of a stretch.  IT dramatically reduces supernatural elements in the play (again, a heavily modern conceit).  The questions of ""fate"" and ""free-will"" are there, but in many ways the setting and way Patrick Stewart is cast puts the whole play out of focus.

4259573,2,B00443FMKM,"This production just isn't my taste, so I won't even pretend to be unbiased.  The cinematography and direction are of the Spartacus/300 type--""artsy"" stylization that accompanies a lot of shaky camera work, jump cuts, and histrionic performances (even for a stage play).

One of the great things about Shakespeare's writing, which we have learned from so many differing interpretations like this one, is that at the center of everything is great insights into the nature of humanity, and that can be a tremendous scaffolding onto which all sorts of dressings can be hung.  But one aspect of Shakespeare that is precious to me, which makes his plays more than just great human dramas, is that he so often involves the supernatural--ghosts, as we see here, in Hamlet, etc.--and in the case of Macbeth, the famous ""weird sisters,"" who, as written, exist unquestionably (as they are seen by multiple characters at once, unlike ghosts who typically only haunt an individual and therefore can be interpreted as psychological manifestations) in both the real world and the supernatural, since they make predictions that come true and have insight into characters' identities without knowing them.  The witches are integral to 'Macbeth,' and given how real they are to the story, Lady Macbeth's pleas to and divination of the dark powers of hell take on a fantastical element, as well.  Given that, I *need* to see the witches/weyward sisters as what they are...certainly not as gruesome emergency room nurses, as we see them in the opening of this production.  This is a story set in a specific time and setting, when and where people's lives were integrated with natural and ""unnatural"" or evil world forces--they saw the world this way, and so the world was this way for them.  The heavy-handed treatment of Macbeth as some sort of World War II parallel just bothers me.  I am pretty open to Shakespearean interpretations, but this one definitely is not my taste, and I think some of the choices the producers/director made here detract in a serious way from the power of the source material.  If I am imposing my opinions on others, which I am by virtue of writing this, I'd say that this might be an interesting interpretation for people who already know Macbeth very well and are either bored with traditional takes or who are maybe turned on by new interpretations in general, but for people who don't know the play, this treatment is missing a lot.  Of course, some people are simply turned off by the supernatural, but some stories require it--Game of Thrones and the Harry Potter series, and even the Bible, offer great narratives, but they lose all their power without the fantastical elements that raise the stakes beyond everyday experience.  The same is true of this.  Macbeth is of a time and place, and in that time and place, the supernatural was undeniable, and so it should be played out that way.  In my opinion. :)",1425513600,12,2927,4.877016129032258

But watching this Macbeth has in many ways changed the way I perceive the Bard.

I have watched a few productions of this play in the past, most notably the McKellan/Dench version which I would recommend highly. But not as highly as this one.  While many have their qualms about setting Shakespeare to more modern settings, I feel this Macbeth captures just the right tone for Shakespeares classic tale of madness and murder. Its intense, bloody, brutal, and even at times a little bit scary. Without a doubt my favorite part of this production is Kate Fleetwood as Lady Macbeth. My GodJust wow. There were times when I flipped back the DVD just so I could watch her scenes over again. Its an extraordinary performance. Very tense, at times howling, but remarkably controlled. Patrick Stewarts Macbeth serves as a definitive study for how to pull off a great performance of MacBeth. The balance he finds between Macbeths apprehension and malice is just magnificent and his version of the Tomorrow soliloquy ranks so high for me it cannot see the ground. He encapsulated the whole tragedy of the play into one fleeting word. Nothing.

This production also includes some of the best Macbeth witches (as nurses of all things), as well as a brilliantly vile interpretation of the porter played by Christopher Nolan, No not that one. (To see just how vastly Shakespeares characters can be interpreted, just compare this films porter with the comedic one from the Dench/McKellan version.  Completely different).  Ultimately one of the best Macbeths Ive seen to date. Not only for the naturalism of the performances, but for once again bringing new exciting life to a play thats as immortal as its ghosts. Not to mention its really entertaining.

Other Great MacBeths:
Throne of Blood- Really more of an interpretation than an exact adaptation, but still an awesome film. Supposedly a favorite of T.S Eliot and critic Harold Bloom (who Im not at all a fan of, but nevertheless the man has good tastes.)

Orson Welles MacBeth- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9BUg7WG2Z4

Polanski MacBeth- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WZcFnZ2ZMR0

McKellan/Dench Version- This MacBeth is far more sub-dued  and almost funny in how 70s it is (apparently turtlenecks were big back then). But it is worth seeing just for Dame Judi Denchs steely performance as Lady MacBeth.

This version of ""the Scottish play"" is not set in ancient Scotland, but in a bombarded 20th Century nation during wartime. Most of the scenes are  shot inside a creepy old building under fire. Interesting touches include the witches being nurses who watch as the soldier flatlines, taking his heart and vanishing in the elevator, and Banquo being murdered aboard a train. My high school seniors were enthralled by the riveting performances and seemed to get more from this version of Macbeth than the Roman Polanski-directed DVD we also watched.

4259614,2,B00443FMKM,"I just think it's a dumb play.  Like I wrote in my review of the PBS series of examining Shakespeare ""from the inside"", you have to put yourself in Macbeth's shoes.  You've just come back from a massive blood letting war; swords clashing, maybe some gun and canon fire, bloody cavalry charges and swinging of swords to slash at enemy soldiers, probably decapitating many an infantryman.

And your cousin shirks your right to ascend the throne, or, better yet, receive compensation for the wars?  The throne you don't really need, but money and food would be nice.  Remember, YOU COMMAND the King's army.  You probably wouldn't covet the throne so much as demand the money owed your troops and merchants and farmers for supplying your forces.  In those days, if the king refused, you'd lay siege to his castle.

You certainly wouldn't conspire with some idiot female to murder the king.  You'd just either have him arrested, or simply level then storm both castle and keep.

I just laugh at the notion that there is anything plotwise plausible in this play.  It's stupid.  It gets even worse when Macbeth blames his wife for cajoling him into the act ... I mean, come on!  A battle hardened general who was slaughtering troops a few days before suddenly feels the need to go behind both the king and the law to take the throne?

Huh?  What?  Did I miss something?

I don't care what any Shakespeare snob says as a retort, this is an idiotic play with idiotic characters.  I'm just sorry it's given the prestige of ""a classic"".

If I had written the thing, Macbeth would have demanded payment, then stormed the castle when he didn't get it, then executed his wife for being a pain in the ass, and shack up with some Scottish hottie.  The end.

Oh man...I've been waiting years to say that.  Not everything in the Shakespeare portfolio is sacred.  It was not written on golden parchment with magical ink with an author inspired from the divine.  It's a work of fiction, and with some major ... no, strike that, MASSIVE plot holes.

4259617,5,B00443FMKM,"Patrick Stewart is excellent as Macbeth, and Kate Fleetwood is a perfect Lady Macbeth!  Their performances are convincing, passionate, and raw.  What I like about this film is the obvious love and desire the Macbeths have for each other at the onset of the play.  Stewart and Fleetwood are a believable couple.  They look forward to seeing each other, to sharing good news with each other, to touching each other, but as they become mired in their ambitions, and worse...become successful at gaining status, their isolation from one another grows. I like that although the play is famously dark, and violent, the subtleties between the Macbeths, the unreciprocated touch, the weary stare, the dismissiveness of one another is just as haunting and memorable as the blood baths.
Their separateness and the differences of their madness are striking in this film.

Primarily set in dark, dank industrial-type buildings, under a Poe-esque oppressive sky, the disturbing setting is absolutely appropriate.  The decision to set the play in what looks like an abandoned asylum adds to the grotesque nightmare, making an indelible impression on the viewer.  The lighting, the single sink in the middle of a dark room, the cold kitchen...all of it exaggerates the soulless and lost characters who inhabit that space.  And the witches!!! They are the scariest of all. They are NOT bumbling old ladies making brews and predictions...they are contorting, convulsing satanic messengers, reanimating the dead, and seemingly always nearby, which constantly reminds the viewer of a possible worse afterlife for the Macbeths, if that is even possible.

Overall, excellent.  It may take a moment to adjust to the setting...is it Stalin's world? or Winston Smith's?  Whatever it is, it is sterile, industrial, oppressive, and perfect.  It's hell realized in synchronized subtleties:  misery, torture, agony, and torment.  This Macbeth has it all.

I have witnessed many different performances both on stage and in cinema and each of them has merits and detractors but frankly this one takes the grand prize. (yes it even beat out Throne of Blood which is a masterpiece of cinema).
While it is not as large scale or grand as others the sets are well thought out in regards to ambiance and the feel of the story. The acting is beyond superb and I will say beyond a shadow of doubt that Patrick Stewart is simply amazing in this role. All the actors were excellent really. I have seen a few people comment on its low budget feel in how narrow it is as far as the sets but honestly I felt that served it better than doing grand scenery and landscapes or impressive cinematography.
The strength of this play is and always shall be in its characters and the story. Large scenery can actually distract from this so keeping it simple does it the most justice.
In fact one of the best performances I have seen live had absolutely no set outside of a black backdrop and the costumes were fairly modern in design, but this brought your attention fully to the actors and moment in the story making the impact of it all much sharper.

If you are a Shakespeare fan at all this is simply the finest film version yet made and I highly recommend it.
If you are new to the story but want an excellent dramatic work, definitely watch it.
I can promise you a riveting experience.",1412294400,,1585,4.283333333333333

Strange as it was a math program. But in conversation and sharing outside the classroom, I was re-introduced to the works of Shakespeare. It took me back to days and nights of under-grad study at Aurora University, when I would retreat into the Shakespeare room of the library. I love the ""comedies"" more than the drama. And, to tell the truth, I like Patrick Stewart. I saw this as a video - somewhere - and decided that I just needed to own it, to watch it again, (and again) at leisure.

What prevents me from giving it a five star is the setting and interpretation (visual) in a modern warfare setting with automatic weapons rather than broadswords and axes. Albeit, Kenneth Brannagh's Hamlet succeeded beyond my wildest expectations in pushing the setting to an early nineteenth century millieu, Shoving MacBeth into the twentieth century, is, I believe, too much. How the witches are dealt with also gives me pause. It gives them an overall feel of setting the tragedy in motion and guiding it's progress, to the extent that if not for them, MacBeth would not choose the path he does.",1400630400,,753,4.844961240310077

If you are trying to figure out how Macbeth should be played -- as an ambitious politician? as a madman? -- you will not get much help from him. Kate Fleetwood as Lady Macbeth gives the best performance.

If anything, it brings the terror of Macbeth's blood reign closer to home.

And Patrick Stewart does a fantastic job here.  All the characters did really well, in fact: they were believable and conveyed their characters perfectly.

Multiple scenes are filmed in a kitchen setting, which is of great detriment to the play's raw material.  Scotland is a place under siege by the sins of Macbeth, but that siege becomes the proverbial tempest in a teapot due to too many interior shots.  Wasn't in all of filmdom the turret of a castle available for a location shoot?
  To the acting.  Kate Fleetwood, who commences her portrayal as a fierce Lady Macbeth, eventually gives way to premature weeping and a complete surrender of the character's strength and cunning.  The actor portraying the porter, who is the greatest thespian standout, should have been Macbeth.  His portrayal, evidencing the raw and mercurial nature of Macbeth, would have been so much more engaging.
  The costumes are an uneven lot.  In particular, the red dress Kate Fleetwood wears in one pivotal scenes is an embarrassment, with one excepting her breasts to pop out at any given moment before a gathering of statesmen.

Suffice it to say he does everything but chew the bloody daggers in his quest to overact the best of them.  He lingers over every word, as though the play should be entitled ""THE PORTER"".  Shame on the director for not sending the poor sod to acting class before allowing him to act with the likes of Stewart.
  Stewart is good but at times he seems to be savoring his lines too much - Hamlet would say he ""mouths them"".  Don't get me wrong.  He's not bad.  He's simply not a great Macbeth.

4259729,3,B00443FMKM,"OK. I hate having to do this. Hate it. But it's my honest, genuine opinion.

Shakespeare was great, and told great stories.

But his language was, well, medieval or something.

I don't claim to be a scholar on this.

But it seems to me that only a scholar on Shakespeare or... if not medieval, then whatever variant of English that they speak in those plays... could possibly understand and truly follow and enjoy the story.

Sir Patrick, I apologize. I know you are a world-renowned Shakespearean actor. And I know that is way more important than how I know and love and respect you, as Captain Picard of the Enterprise.

But try as I might, I just... simply... can... not... get... past what I perceive, anyway, as stilted at best, and all but incomprehensible at worst, archaic English.

This very much much ___IS___ -- is is is is, have I gotten that point across? Good -- a new take on the play.

But my problem is... the language.

I am a heathen. An unsophisticated, uneducated, uncouth heathen. I admit it.

Look. It's very good. It has Sir Patrick Stewart as the lead. That by itself guarantees that it's good.

For _myself_, and myself _alone_... I couldn't really enjoy it because, I guess... here's another admission... I'm an American. Grown too complacent. Or something. There's something... quintessentially British about Shakespeare's language that Americans just don't seem to get. I guess we really are two cultures separated by a common language. Or something. At least, I'd kind of like to blame it on that, when, probably, it's just my own laziness.

When I watch something, I guess... I just don't want to work that hard, trying to figure out what the folks on screen are really saying.

Not that I'm down there with, I dunno, Barney the purple dinosaur or something. I'm somewhere in the middle. I hope, anyway, closer to Shakespeare than Barney... but definitely somewhere in the middle.

Shakespeare in the original language is... just too much work for me to try to decipher. Instead of being fun, it's hard work for me to watch. That really isn't what I'm looking for, in entertainment.

I'll say it again. I am a heathen. An unsophisticated, uneducated, uncouth heathen. I admit it. And while I don't exactly wallow in it, and am vaguely ashamed of it, I have no real, immediate, pressing desire to be otherwise.

So I guess my review is this: if you love Shakespeare, in the original language, you'll very probably love this. Based on Sir Patrick Stewart being the lead, and I understand, anyway, he's one of the best, if not _the_ best, Shakespearean actor out there at the moment. And it absolutely gives the play a new setting... Nazi Germany. Unless I got that, somehow, wrong, too. But if you're like me, and have a hard time, and have to work too hard to enjoy, deciphering Shakespeare's dialog... honestly... although I am utterly loath to give Sir Patrick a thumbs down in any way... well, I won't say it. I'll say instead, simply, be warned.

Love and respect to Sir Patrick Stewart. Please give us an updated, more easily understood version, that's still 100% faithful, Sir Patrick. If anyone can, you can. I'm sorry if that's heresy.",1374624000,5,3173,4.74

I will throw my little issues in while I discuss, but do know that I think the acting is overall very good.  Patrick Stewart is pretty amazing as Macbeth.  The supporting cast is all very good, but I did feel that Kate Fleetwood as Lady Macbeth was trying to hard. I think that appearing on screen so often with the much better Patrick Stewart caused her to stretch her talent a bit.  Again, kind of nitpicking, but she didn't quite capture the crazed aspect of Lady Macbeth, especially during the iconic hand washing scene in the final act.  Instead she played Lady Macbeth very intensely, an intensity enhanced by her VERY square and large jaw and jutting cheekbones.  It really made her look like she was clenching every time she was on screen.

All that aside, the style of the adaptation was interesting.  I enjoyed the Soviet WW2 aspect.  But there were a few issues here.  In the last few scenes, I noticed that the soldiers were wearing modern, digitally produced urban camouflage instead of uniforms consistent with the setting.  In WW2, solid color uniforms were the norm, not computer generated, pixelated urban gray.  The guns were mostly from the period, and the other uniforms and settings were time appropriate so I wonder what happened.

The style was definitely in a more intense and bloody Macbeth.  Perhaps this is why Lady Macbeth was portrayed the way she was?  But the intensity went way up, the tension and creepiness went down.  One particular scene which caught my ire was when the ghost of Banquo leapt onto the dinner table, knocking over a glass.  I prefer the version true to the play where he sits in a vacant seat and Macbeth doesn't notice him at first.  Spooky.  Instead the ghost points at Macbeth, ala Hamlet.

And in keeping with the intensity, the director had some odd, brief scenes.  I guess he figured they weren't being intense enough early on so they broke to a brief shot of a hooded prisoner in a cellar, a guy walks up and shoots him in the head, cut to next scene.  What?  Was that necessary?  I don't mind the blood and all, but that just didn't really make sense to include.

Other funny little things I noticed: the intro has a lot of black and white, real life WW2 footage to set the mood.  Then we kind of forget the Soviet aspect until the scene where Macbeth and Lady Macbeth are outside on horses (about halfway through).  From that point on we have more of the old footage, flags, pictures of Macbeth in a very Stalin-esque style, and so on.  It's like the director said ""Oh crap, we forgot it was supposed to be Soviet, so hurry and throw in some props!""

The biggest and most gruesome affront though was the cutting of dozens of lines as well as the removal of an entire scene.  Never mind the curiosity of the Porter, Murderer, Lady MacDuff, Ross, Lennox, Caithness confusion (they mixed all these characters up, often inexplicably - at one point Lady MacDuff is reading Lennox's lines, later the Porter is, and even later Ross is.  Then Ross reads Caithness... it's a bit odd); the Wyrd sisters (one of the best aspects of this version of Macbeth) had entire scenes cut, as well as entire chunks of dialogue cut.  When Macbeth comes the second time, they sing the first half of their iconic chant, but then the second half of their dialogue is cut completely (the part which the play actually says they sing).  Also the entire scene where Hecate upbraids the witches is gone.  Sad!  Especially since I felt they were one of the shining stars of this version.

The train scenes were very well done, especially the murder of Banquo.  The montage afterwards, where Macbeth's men were rounding up dissenters was also very well done.  The scene where Macbeth and his Lady are preparing for dinner was among my favorites.  The red of the room, Lady Macbeth speaking to the camera reflected in a mirror, these were well done.

So I am not saying this is bad.  In fact it is very good.  I docked a star for the cutting of entire scenes, as well as a lot of lines.  Note that the aforementioned were not the only lines cut.  Many scenes had entire character blocks removed.  Pay particular note to the dinner scene where Banquo appears.  I wonder if they felt the time was running long and decided to trim some excess from the second half (it is still over 2 1/2 hours)?

So overall a good adaptation with a few items I didn't care for.  The acting was overall excellent.  Most of the scenes were well done.  It's just uneven at times, and I docked the star for some of the cuts made.  I feel either: A) stick to the play very closely in dialogue, though not necessarily in setting (as in the RSC version with Dench); OR B) go all out and make many obvious changes (as in Throne of Blood).  Making a few minor changes for the setting and all is fine, but I felt the cut lines were still important to the play.  It's still worth watching though, but don't let it be the first version of Macbeth you view.  Watch a live production, or better yet, check out the RSC version first.  Then you can probably enjoy the weirder ones more.",1361404800,2,5742,4.862886597938144

Our own time, in which castles have become gated mansions and the most of us are peasants and peons, to be manipulated by a few barons.  Although apparently set between the 1930s and 1950s with the exception of modern weaponry and a modern-appearing car, the themes of constant war, lust for power, a ruling oligarchy, and treason masked with lies are all terrifying reminders of the slippery slide of our own country since the early 1980s--really, since the United States chose imperialist and ""multinational"" world domination at the end of World War Two--into the quicksand of materialist piggery, scorn of the weak, and casual violence.

Still, I think this is my favorite film adaptation of Macbeth so far, although I've always enjoyed the Scottish version with Jason Connery (mainly because Lady Macbeth was hot).  The acting is mostly good, and it delivers the clearest presentation of the difficult Elizabethan English of any version of the film so far by avoiding the common mistake in Shakespearean performances of simply shouting lines in officious British accents while waving arms, for the most part. Unfortunately, the bad parts are really bad, but I would say it's about a 75/25 ratio of good to bad, which seems to be pretty good for Shakespeare movies.

4259784,3,B00443FMKM,"I bought a copy of this production at a Borders going-out-of-business sale.  Hummm.  What a strange version of the play.

There's nothing inherently wrong with trying to re-interpret a classic; however, much of this attempt just seems unnecessary and gets in the way.  As others have said, the setting is a strange combination of Hilterian bunker, Stalinist cult of personality, and revolutionary Che (the AK-47s and camouflage suggest Vietnam and later).  The oppressive, claustrophobic dungeon/urinal/bunker set has some good points to it.  There is a great deal of blood.  The camera flares during the battle at the end are extraordinarily distracting.

The principals must have had orders from the director to take several lines and words with clear textual meanings and to give them intonations and stage movements that would purposely wrench that meaning out of context.  That is very annoying.

I do not like it when directors decide to write their own Shakespearean play by toying with the plot.  Why are Lady MacDuff and her children accompanying MacDuff to awaken Duncan the morning his body is discovered?  Why are Banquo and Fleance killed while fleeing on a train, when the play clearly indicates that they return to the castle after their ride?  Why does the director drop the whole idea that the ghost of Banquo is sitting in Macbeth's seat at the table?

The strange dance with the mop at the banquet...I just don't know what to say about that.  The witches' dance and the meeting with MacBeth when the three apparitions don't appear but speak through corpses is shockingly bad.

The acting:  Lady M does a fine job, for the most part.  She is sexy and seductive and in control in the beginning, and then becomes fearful of the monsterish husband she has helped create.  Why does she walk so strangely?

Ross does an excellent job.  Lady MacDuff is excellent (though why do they drop the son's quip about how the honest men are outnumbered?).  Malcolm does a fine job.  MacDuff holds himself in odd positions; he does not seem someone used to holding weapons.  The interchange between Malcolm and MacDuff in which Malcolm tests MacDuff's loyalty is especially good, and Ross' entrance and MacDuff's horror upon learning of his family's fate are equally well done.

Patrick Stewart does many things well, especially after the first act or two.  He too screams a number of lines that may not require it.

The porter, who doubles as Seyton, is really, really bad.  The way he pronounces each line as if it were a curse is just out of place.

If you have an interest in Shakespeare, I would rent this version, because it has some interesting parts, but I would not buy it.",1312675200,9,2684,4.850220264317181
4259785,4,B00443FMKM,"Overall, I think this is a really good production of Macbeth.  It brings some new life to the story that hasn't been seen on the screen, in my opinion, since the Roman Polanski version (any dislike for the director aside, it was probably the most watchable film version we had).  Most of the acting in this adaptation is good, but there are moments that don't quite work.  As much as I love Sir Patrick Stewart, there are times when his, or the director's, interpretation of tone just seems off.  Sometimes I wonder that it is merely the direction, especially when an entire scene seems out of place.  I was a little confused at an immersion-breaking game of musical chairs, played with a dirty mop, that took place during the ghost of Banquo scene.  After the death of Duncan, and subsequent discovery of his body, there is barely a moment before Macbeth is giving orders from atop a horse.  The transition to king simply isn't there.  The fact that they eliminated the crowning lessened the slight that Macduff gave Macbeth in not attending.  They show Macduff leaving, but it makes little sense to the overall plot in the film.

This adaptation also fails to tell the viewer what, exactly, happens to Lady Macbeth.  It is simply announced, by the creepy porter, that she is dead.  Now I know that the original play had her death occurring offstage, but Malcom's lines about her dying by ""self and violent hands"" is left entirely out.  I suppose that, in this version, he was too busy holding Macbeth's head to comment.  It may only be one line, but I think it was too valuable to cut.  As for the significance of her death, Macbeth barely reacts... that is until his ""Tomorrow"" soliloquy.  This speech is a hair length from being out of place.  If he is barely affected by her death, why would he make such an introverted examination of the very meaning of life?  The lack of emotion during this scene makes the Lady's lessened role in the final Acts almost entirely meaningless.  Again, one cannot be certain if this is Stewart or Goold, but it came off as a bit contrived.  The soliloquy viewed by itself, however, is pure acting gold, so I'm leaning on this being Goold's fault.

Other bits of the movie suffer the break that so often occurs in places when any Shakespeare play is ""modernized"".  When Macbeth returns to the three witches, the viewer finds that the ""cauldron bubble"" lines have become something of a strange, heart-beating rap.  Every other scene with the witches was so well done, as was the take that this version has of their increased role in the events of Macbeth (they seem to be ever-present, ensuring that their prophecies come true), that this scene stands alone as an oddity of imperfection.  The next part of the scene after Macbeth arrives, however, returns to the high expectations formerly lain by the movie.

The most glaring oddity, for me, was using marines in gilly suits to represent the moving woods of Burnham.  Most of the original lines referring to this in prophecy are in the movie, including Macbeth's, and so the downplay on this huge plot element is disappointing.  I wonder if a lot of this was just the result of budget issues, as most of the film is shot indoors.  It feels rather like a large set of bunkers, which I actually thought sold the temporal setting of the movie quite well.  When Malcom orders every man to ""hew him down a bough"",however, I did not expect soldiers wearing weeds.  I expected them to be carrying bough's.  The original play aside, this does not work well even within the confines of the film.

While the things I have pointed out may seem like gaping wounds in the carcass of a bad movie, they are not.  There is so much good in this movie that these elements seem minute.  Perhaps I am just too critical.  So much in this movie was a breath of fresh air, from the phenomenal lighting, to the good acting, and the pure creepiness of the weird sisters.  No other production of Macbeth has been so emotionally engaging, especially when Macduff learns of his family's death.  I was constantly smiling during this movie, and the ""huh?"" moments were brief and sparing.  Most of my problems with the movie come from personal study and interpretation, and doubtless many will disagree with me (it's Shakespeare, what else could I expect).  In the end, I found it very enjoyable and it will likely become my go-to film adaptation of Macbeth.

Though I may occasionally return to Polanski for the actual trees.",1309651200,4,4482,4.652671755725191
4259786,4,B00443FMKM,"It is always a challenge to stage well known pieces that have been performed endless times before. The pressure is to present a new fresh interpretation of literary  works that are sometimes so well known that the general population can quote passages from heart. I recall, for instance, attending a performance of Wagner's Ring opera cycle where the motif was a cross between Cat on a Hot Tin Roof (Wotan was Bid Daddy) and the Wild Bunch (they were the Walkuries).

Here, in this interpretation of Macbeth the motifs are taken from Soviet Russia in the 40s or 50s. Cloak and Dagger stuff. While watching this,or any other innovative,  interpretation the question was, Does it work? Peter Sellar's highly innovative versions of Mozart's operas in 1990's New York City, that worked.

The answer for this Macbeth is a qualified ""Yes."" There were times at which I winsed at watching this interpration. The reason why this interpretation does not occasionally work is because of the model from which the director has obtained his inspiration. Soviet Russia in the 40s and 50s was a dark, dreary, banal place to be; it is no surprise then that the end product will display that banality and dreariness as well. There are definite elements of the original play which rises above that banalty. Macbeth is a powerful piece of literature; the themes of this play are universal and would apply to any time period. Rising above the darkness of this portrayal the eloquence and beauty of Shakespeare's words shine brightly and provide the only brightness in the dark themes presented.

And how original was the choice to stage Macbeth in post war Eastern Europe! If ever there was a time where power struggles and intregue was the order of the day, that was the time. If the performances appear wooden, it is likely because it was a wooden period of time, the world generally still stunned from a horrendous world war.

You need to watch this interpretation with an open mind, and it will take you in.",1308873600,2,1990,4.804093567251462
4259787,3,B00443FMKM,"This review does not principally address Shakespeare's play, nor the acting in this version, which is generally excellent, within its constraints.  I am addressing the production's most obvious feature: it's relocation in time, and it's staging.

We are in the 20th Century here.  This is no defect. The actual era of Macbeth is extremely misty--it is quite certainly not Elizabethan.  A tale of maddened ambition, bloody tyranny, a state defiled is certainly at home in the dungeon-century we have just crawled out of (and into what, one might ask?).  The opening scene (on a battlefield) seems first to be World War I--perhaps in Serbia or some such place.  Later, the Second War comes to seem more likely.

The opening setting is some kind of field hospital within a large fortification (subterranean largely, elevators--the Maginot line?).  The ""Bloody Man,""--the injured Scottish messenger--is interviewed by senior officers (I am assuming some familiarity with the play) while being given blood, attention to an abdominal wound, evidently severe, etc.  This is highly convincing.  It is therefore chilling to discern that the nurses are the Three Witches on their first appearance.  What is more fearsome than an evil nurse?  Left alone with him, the witches appear to kill him for his heart.  Good lord!  This production is off and running.

But Macbeth is a dangerous place.  Theatre people fear the play.  It is just where to meet a hobgoblin.  And hobgoblins, with the face of Consistency, are known to haunt small minds.  Having gotten into this odd structure, our production can't get out. The entire play (with a couple of exceptions to be noted) takes place in a white-tiled, but dirty, institutional kitchen, or possibly latrine, or possibly both.  Underground.

King Duncan lives in it.  The Macbeths live in it (forcing Duncan, arriving at their ""castle"" to exclaim, ""This castle hath a pleasant seat..."" while apparently in the Subway).  The exigences of latrine life take their toll on court etiquette:  Lady Macbeth, Countess of Cawdor, is shown wiping down her own kitchen and dishing up fowls for the King as though she were Blondie Bumstead (admittedly, her kitchen help consists exclusively of the Three Witches, who never go away).

I promised some excursions from the latrine.  We are, of course, in Scotland under a tyranny.  Quite a number of the personae take refuge off and on in England.  They are able to travel between the two capitols by a convenient steam express, presumably the old Flying Scotsman.  Banquo and his son are assaulted in their flight--Banquo is murdered, of course, his boy escapes--by the railroad tea-service staff, who have become Macbeth's tame thugs--a chilling detail for those brought up in terror of British Railways tea.  There is a good scene with snarling police dogs and goose-stepping troops in the background outside a comparatively normal residence that Macbeth once uses.  (It is gracious of the production to make the 20th Century monster Macbeth is turning into Stalin and not the ever-popular Hitler.)

Tragedy cannot endure bathos.  Bathos is what is going on here as Lady Macbeth seems to look for the Saran-Wrap in her inconvenient kitchen, in the tea-service murders, in the inability of anyone to go anywhere except in a giant elevator, in Banquo's corpse laboriously getting up in the train carriage (has it stopped?) and plodding off, like Bela Lugosi, to appear at Macbeth's dinner (where the waitresses will be...the witches).

If the other aspects of the production were silly as all this, the enterprise would simply not matter.  But there is much here that is good, even very good.  Macbeth as...Robert Mugabe, Pol Pot, the ghastly Ghaddafi, Stalin?...is a perfectly valid idea (though he proves much easier to get rid of than they--Shakespeare didn't know everything we do).  Macbeth himself (perhaps he has read Tony Tanner's magisterial ""Prefaces to Shakespeare"") marvelously projects his character's strangely clear sight (Macbeth always sees the full moral consequence of what he is about to do), and his hideous compulsion (he always does it anyway).  Lady Macbeth's slow unraveling after her carnivorous beginning is perfectly managed (does she lack her husband's terrible vision and does not see how deep a pit she is digging them, or does she unravel in step with her husband--though quite differently, there is male and female here--or both?).  The Thane of Fife's remorse at going to England and leaving his wife and small children to be killed by the monster (his action is inexplicable, but that's Shakespeare, not this production), and his implacable hunger for revenge afterwards (maybe Shakespeare's intention) is heartbreaking.  This could be a valuable Macbeth.

But couldn't we please get out of the kitchen a little?  Or is it the latrine?  My three stars are given to the acting and by some of the concept (which, if not marred, would have deserved more).  The staging deserves a great deal less.",1307923200,29,5000,5.119753086419753
4259788,5,B00443FMKM,"A very good reshaping of Shakespeare's more streamlined tragedy. It's a singularly caustic and fascist take on Macbeth.  I didn't care for all of the directorial choices, but that's what Shakespeare intends/intended in his works ... to allow actors and directors to have freedom and flexibility which allows for subtle (and not-so-subtle) shifts in how the work is presented.  For my money, the best film version of Macbeth is Kurosawa's Throne of Blood ... which takes place in Feudal Japan, about as far (literally and figuratively) from Medieval Scotland as you can get.  That Shakespeare's work allows directors and actors to make those shifts is something wonderful.

Anyway, I didn't think the age gap between Macbeth and Lady Macbeth was particularly effective (or useful), although I thought the two characters had terrific chemistry.  Some of the scenes were, in my opinion, a bit over the top ... but this is part of the directorial choice.  It works because Patrick Stewart's Macbeth is more ambivalent than many or most other interpretations.  Even when he's cold and in command, he gives an air of distraction to the character which is quite true to the theme of Macbeth.  It's a terrific performance; the plaudits the play received in 2007 and 2008 are clearly deserved.",1305676800,2,1284,5.052132701421801
4259789,1,B00443FMKM,"I know, I know - there are probably worse Macbeth's out there, but surely this farce is in the top 3 (or would that be bottom 3?).

First off let's get all the nonsense out of the way.  Yes, this is an ""updated"" take on Shakespeare, setting the story in some quasi-1930's/modern age militaristic setting.  I'm not against updating the plays as a rule, sometimes it works splendidly (I saw a great ""Taming of the Shrew"" set in 1930's America with Petruchio as a Texas oil magnate), but Goold's updating here is like one worn out cliche after another.  Macbeth is a bad military leader?  Then let's reference the Nazis (complete with random German folk dancing scene)!  The Weird Sisters are cast as nurses because they're so evil (ooh, dig that crazy irony).  Lady Macbeth is a horribly evil woman, so let's make her a happy housekeeper ala Donna Reed in the beginning (ooh, more of that crazy irony!).  Given the trendiness of vampires right now I'm shocked they didn't try to fit them into the movie somehow.

Worse, though, is that the updating actually makes all of the action in the play silly to the point of absurd.  Everyone walks around with a machine gun, but because most of the lines reference swords they have to whip out a puny knife when they start talking about their ""blade.""  So, yes folks, you actually have characters stupid enough to bring knives to gun fights.  What assuredly looked ""clever"" on paper - ""when Birnam Wood marches we'll make it into crazy military camouflage!"" looks incredibly stupid on screen - yes, Macbeth's people were stupid enough to think three guys in mossy camo constituted Birnam Wood on the march (but what was the use of camouflage anyway seeing as how they're constantly under mortar fire?).  The use of the ""audio-sync"" effect every time the Weird Sisters talk is, I suppose, meant to be scary.  It only succeeds in making everything they say incomprehensible.  But, to make sure we keep everyone's interest, Goold's given us plenty of gross-out factor visuals such as corpses being electrocuted, human hearts being tossed around willy-nilly, Patrick Stewart's severed head, and enough blood to paint the side of a barn.  They also threw in some of the cliche ""super-cool"" film techniques, such as shaking the camera a lot and using random cuts during the ""battle"" scenes to make it ""exciting"" (the use of random blue-green light streaks across the screen I found a particularly annoying addition to this tradition).  The ""battle"" scene is, itself, laughable, with plenty of sounds of gunfire but practically no one firing a gun onscreen (must not have had a budget for blanks).  Plus, watching actors with guns can be entertaining, there's one poor dope towards the end who clearly has no idea how to hold a rifle.  And God forgive them for the Weird Sisters ""rap"" complete with the nurses gyrating all over corpses ala some sort of Lady Gaga music video.

And why they set the entire movie in a subway terminal - I have no idea.  Apparently the inside of Macbeth's castle is tiled just like a men's room.

So, all that nonsense aside, what are you left with?  A bunch of overacting and a sadly miscast lead.  First the overacting.

I'm not sure if it's because directors think audiences fall asleep during Shakespeare or if they think audiences are too dense to understand what's going on without gobs of extra emphasis, but whatever the case, enough already!  Encouraging actors to scream words that are not meant to be screamed is not good directing.  Often times it makes the lines funny when they weren't meant to be.  For instance, during Lady Macbeth's madness, instead of sighing she shrieks in agony.  Of course, the doctor then says, ""What a sigh is there.""  Perhaps the good doctor was incredibly hard of hearing?  Or at the end of the banquet scene, Lady Macbeth says, ""You lack the season of all natures, SLEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEP!""  Aside from being inconsistent with the text surrounding this line, it makes Lady Macbeth look much more insane than the husband she's trying to console.  Lady Macbeth's great speech in Act I is a dud, as well.

I wasn't crazy about Scott Handy as Malcolm, Michael Feast as Macduff wasn't bad till the end, but really it's all about the star, Macbeth.

And the play's biggest disappointment is, alas, Patrick Stewart himself.  While I have always enjoyed Mr. Stewart, he is just not a good Macbeth (not even the crazy mustache could help).  From the very beginning he comes across as awkward in his military uniform.  You never get the sense that this is a great and noble man, fearless in battle and strong in ambition.  You get the sense that he's sort of a meek and possibly bumbling little guy who wound up in a uniform about half-a-size too big for him and who gets bullied around by his wife all the time.  This is a shame because without the noble hero from the beginning his fall into blood loses all impact.  There are moments when Mr. Stewart does shine, but they are few and far between, and even at the height of his corrupt glory you never get the sense of menace or dread Macbeth should command.

So what tries so hard to be edgy and cool winds up being tired and a waste of time and talent full of plenty of ""sound and fury"" but not much else.",1303776000,37,5252,4.670293797606093
4259790,2,B00443FMKM,Sorry guys. Patrick Stewart can't keep this movie alive.  It's overwrought and overdone.  The actors are stiff and lifeless.  They read their lines as if on tranquilizers. I've seen worse adaptations but not much worse.,1300924800,5,219,5.2

It's an affirmation of both the skill of the director and the timelessness of Shakespeare that it works tremendously well.

Patrick Stewart is magnificent, and Kate Fleetwood is deliciously evil as Lady Macbeth.  But what you'll remember is the way the witches are portrayed.

It was an absolutely amazing experience, and not just because of Patrick Stewart. All the performances were great and I loved the creative stage design (the elevator!), the Stalinesque aesthetic, etc. So when I heard that there would be a film version released on DVD, I was thrilled.

But even having seen and loved the live version didn't quite prepare me for this video. I was blown away. As with the DVD version of Hamlet starring David Tennant, they spruced it up with gorgeous sets and locations and nifty editing to make it more ""cinematic"" and not just a filmed stageplay. The performances are as great as ever (and some of them I was perhaps able to appreciate better than I did from the upper balcony of the theater). Sir Patrick's transition from decent but ambitious guy to ruthless dictator was so natural you never quite lose sympathy for him. Kate Fleetwood's Lady M is almost gleefully wicked but shows her conscience in subtle ways; she and Macbeth have great chemistry. But I think my favorite might actually be the incredibly creepy Weird Sisters. I get chills from their first entrance and all their scenes.

DVD-wise, this is an extremely bare-bones release, with no extras of any kind. I would have loved a director/actor commentary track. Still, the film on its own is definitely worth the price of purchase.",1300233600,4,1509,4.733840304182509

I can't help thinking Shakespeare would approve and applaud this interpretation.  It is very disturbing and at times you'd think you were watching something like Saw.  The witches were especially creepy, and were utilized in scenes where they'd normally not be included.  My only complaint is that it should've included the Paula Zahn interview that was available at the Great Performances website.  Patrick Stewart remarks on how scary his co-star was, and she was nearly a vampire in this.  It remains true to the original text, and is not simply using the story as in many modern adaptations.

4259796,5,B00443FMKM,"Patrick Stewart is one of the few great Shakespearean actors alive today -- you could give this guy any role, and he would enthrall you. So he seems like an obvious choice for the title role of Shakespeare's legendary play ""Macbeth."" This 2010 adaptation is a dark, industrial, grimy affair, with plenty of blood and eerie effects.

Shortly after a victory in battle, Macbeth (Stewart) and his friend Banquo (Martin Turner) are traveling home across a heath when they encounter three witches dresses as nurses. They greet him with ""All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, Thane of Cawdor! All hail, Macbeth! that shalt be king hereafter!""

When MacBeth is made Thane of Cawdor, he naturally begins to think that being king might be next in line. And when King Duncan (Paul Shelley) visits his castle, Lady MacBeth (Suzanne Burden) goads her husband into murdering the king and framing a couple of innocent servants for the deed. As the witches predicted, MacBeth becomes king of Scotland.

But the witches also prophesied that Banquo would be the father of kings, so MacBeth starts tying off loose ends by hiring assassins to kill Banquo and his young son, as well as a wily thane named MacDuff and all of his family. But though MacBeth believes himself to be safe from everyone, his fear begins to grow as madness and guilt torment him and his wife.

One of the most fascinating things about ""Macbeth"" is how evil it is -- mass murder, insanity, bloody ghosts, a trio of manipulative witches, and a weak man who becomes a raving murderous paranoiac. First-time director Rupert Goold seizes on all the blood, darkness and horror of the story, and splashes it all over this adaptation.

Seriously. This is VERY gory and violent: severed heads, ripped-out hearts, and dead bodies all over the place. The only place where Goold holds back is when Macduff's children are killed -- instead he conveys their deaths in a chilling but less graphic way.

The setting is very effective as well -- lots of industrial grime, shadowy rooms, and vast echoing halls with blasts of pale light. Additionally, there are some incredibly weird moments that make the story even more eerie, such as the three witches jerking and spasming through a room filled with dead bodies, or Banquo walking silently over MacBeth's table.

Goold's one drawback is that sometimes the actors get kind of... over-the-top. But Stewart is an absolute joy to play -- he gives a beautifully understated performance that taps into all Macbeth's weakness, greed, fear and madness. Just look at the odd scene where everybody starts dancing -- Stewart's energetic jumps are tinged with desperation, like he's frantically trying to look cheerful.

Burden makes an excellent Lady M., although she seems a bit young for Stewart -- her stark white face and grasping hands make her really look the part, and she has a jittery, hungry energy. and there are solid performances by Michael Feast, Scott Handy, and those women who play the witches.

Patrick Stewart is the heart of 2010's ""Macbeth,"" but this adaptation also has lots of chilling, nightmarish freakiness all on its own. Just don't watch it around small children.",1298764800,6,3166,4.913857677902621

I don't want to spoil this for anyone, but the way Stewart interprets the final fight with MacDuff -- ""Lay on MacDuff, and damned be he that first cries hold"" -- and then as the fight nears its end, yells -- ""Enough!""

Unfortunately, Mr. Stewart was having an off-day, and walked through most of his performance.  The whole was less than the sum of its parts: the elevator held up the action, the set was limiting, and I agree that fusing the Porter with Seyton (inspired by ""Seyton"" being a homophone for ""Satan"") robbed the play of one of its much-needed lighter spots. And the concept that the witches are everywhere, somehow egging-on the action is just trite and really doesn't work- they are separate and reflective of the action of the play, not motivators.

While remaining mostly true to the Bard's language, everything else about this brilliantly re-imagined version of the Scottish Play is brand new. Director Rupert Goold drags the tragedy out of the distant past and into some cryptic, World War II-era hospital netherworld, with the Wyrd Sisters serving as nurses who are as likely to kill their patients as save them. (More likely, actually.)

Stewart is brilliant as Macbeth, and Kate Fleetwood seductively evil as his ""fiend-like queen.""  Half the fun is watching how the familiar parts of the play -- the dagger of the mind, the witches' cauldron scenes, the forest coming to Dunsinane -- are given a fresh coat of paint. Despite being Shakespeare's shortest tragedy, this lasts 180 minutes, the runtime bloated with shocking imagery and avant garde camera angles. Nevertheless, the lines themselves are perfectly clear, and when things get too gory, all one needs to do is close the eyes to experience the grandeur of Shakespeare's language.

A few caveats: The Porter, the only piece of comic relief in the original, is here made cutting edge and dangerous. Following a scene where he urinates in a sink (which Macbeth later uses to wash his hands) and mimics sodomizing a little girl, he pops up like Rambo in the closing scenes, fighting alongside Stewart with a belt of bullets slung over his shoulder. The climax itself is too action-movie like for my tastes, although the shot of Lord and Lady Macbeth descending to hitherto unreachable depths of their underworld home via elevator is the perfect closing scene. Call it a suitable coda to this dark exploration of ambition unchecked by morality.
