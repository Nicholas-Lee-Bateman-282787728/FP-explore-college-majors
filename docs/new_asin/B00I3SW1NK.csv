8638840,5,B00I3SW1NK,"Such a fun, underrated film for those who are looking for obscure bigfoot/yeti cinema. I wasn't expecting much from this, but I was pleasantly surprised--plus how can you go wrong with a giant yeti? In fact, I enjoyed this one more than the '70s Kong film and A*P*E. Unfortunately, the picture quality isn't great, but considering the rarity of the movie, I'll happily take what I can get. Great DVD cover too, they don't make posters like that anymore!",1527638400,,453,4.746835443037975
8638841,1,B00I3SW1NK,"Awful Italian giant monster film that more than resembles the 1975 version of KING KONG. This is the type of movie where you will watch the clock more than the screen hoping that it will end soon, but it doesn't. I can't believe that this film gets a DVD release when there are thousand of horror films still waiting for that chance. I love Italian horror and sci-fi films, but this is the rare occasion where I watched it once and will never watch it again. To say it stinks is being way too kind.",1496620800,,498,4.252631578947368
8638842,2,B00I3SW1NK,"As the other reviewers have said, this is one ugly DVD. Its one redeeming feature is that it's in widescreen, but the image is so compressed and ugly that it hardly matters. The film's infamously incompetent FX are hardly noticeable next to the poor presentation. The final insult is when the end credits cut off in the middle of the excellent theme song! CFS seem to be the most recent heir to a long tradition of poor quality, legally questionable cult film releases on DVD.",1419638400,,476,4.6117647058823525

8638845,3,B00I3SW1NK,"This print of ""Yeti: Giant of the 20th Century"" is one of the worst I have ever seen. It is so washed out that sometimes you might incorrectly believe it's in black and white. There are major scratches and flaws throughout, and while I understand that there may be various copies from other sources available, this was the only version I had ready access to. Although the print is utterly wretched, it actually seems fitting given the production itself. It blatantly apes (if you'll pardon the pun) ""King Kong"" (and yes, think Jessica Lange not Fay Wray here) in every imaginable respect, right down to climbing a tall building with a fair maiden, although this is the only film I can recall that features a giant yeti breathing through a nasal cannula or taking a hot shower while suspended under a helicopter (don't ask,) so there are some unique touches here.

The plot is beyond nutty, even for a 1970s Italian giant creature feature, but hits on the typical plotpoints of greedy entrepreneurs trying to exploit a rare and noble creature after rousing it from centuries of peaceful slumber, and mayhem erupting when all does not go according to plan. This yeti has a bushy mane and rudimentary communication skills (one guess as to who can communicate with him) but somehow still seems to come up with all the wrong facial expressions at exactly the right time: hilarity ensues. While it's hard to overlook the glaring projection photography issues and color mismatches, there are redeeming points here. If, for instance, you ever wanted to see a giant yeti hover over Niagara Falls, this is the movie for you. (It's actually the only movie for you.) If you want to see love, murder, and betrayal yeti style, this is likewise a great film to invest in. If you want see a heroic dog save a yeti in a cloying heart-rending scene without mercy, and the obvious barky miracle which promptly ensues, this is a very good choice. If you, like me, miss Ed Wood's trademark day/night confusion technique, you will definitely want to watch an homage to the master in the concluding scene (It's night! No! It's noon!)

""Yeti: Giant of the 20th Century"" is a film with few peers. Unimaginably bad on every level, it is nonetheless wonderfully entertaining for lovers of grade-Z cinema. This would have made an excellent episode of MST3K, but feel free to watch it as is: you will have no problem coming up with suitable riffs of your own.",1399680000,3,2430,4.72877358490566
8638846,1,B00I3SW1NK,"I love this film and I too own a Bootleg I purchased from Ebay. The Bootleg version is much better than the one I received today from CFS Releasing. I can't even describe the problems with this dvd because I don't have all day to write about it. However, the case is somewhat professional. Possibly in the near future someone will take the time to release this film professionally. Until then STAY AWAY from this version unless you have cataracts that will keep you from seeing this mess.",1398297600,9,488,4.556818181818182
8638847,1,B00I3SW1NK,"This is almost an achievement. The DVD format has been around over 15 years and this may the lousiest looking DVD of them all. Judging from the weird border within the letterbox, it almost looks like the source is a videocamera set up in front of a TV playing a videotape (or maybe a computer playing a YouTube video)??? The sound is bad, too. Ironically, the best-looking part of this DVD is the anti-piracy warning before the film starts. This film deserves a real release by a company who cares. This DVD is some kind of joke. Fortunately there is a legitimate CD release of the wonderfully bonkers soundtrack on Beat Records.",1398211200,7,629,4.625
8638848,1,B00I3SW1NK,"I have a soft spot for this Italian/Canadian Kong '76 rip-off.  I have been lucky enough to see it projected via a fairly decent 16mm print and a couple of semi-decent VHS-sourced DVD bootlegs.  This release, however, is the ABSOLUTE WORST presentation of this film I have encountered.  This DVD is HEAVILY PIXELATED.  This release is a travesty.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS.",1398124800,8,367,4.854838709677419
