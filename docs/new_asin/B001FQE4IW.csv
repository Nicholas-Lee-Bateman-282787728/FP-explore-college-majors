8302276,5,B001FQE4IW,I use this twice a week. A great workout for people who can't get to the gym or just don't have alot of time.,1394928000,5,109,3.5833333333333335
8302277,5,B001FQE4IW,"I must say that I purchased the dvd and equipment from the fluidity website but highly recommend the workout for all fitness levels. I had increased pain and noisy knees, went to orthopedic doctor that stated I would need to have surgery to lengthen tendons that connect kneecaps.  After expensive co-pays for physical therapy I bought the fluidity bar and program.  I now have much more endurance, no pain, and can jump out of bed.  I have more energy in my 40s than I did in my 30s.  The workout is low impact but builds muscle and the stretches are great for stretching the tendons around my hip and knee bones/muscles.  I am not paid for this, and it is not easy, but if you endure you will look and feel better.",1372291200,8,716,4.393939393939394
8302278,4,B001FQE4IW,"I have had the fluidity system for about 3 years. When I first purchased it I did not use it as I should have, just not being consistent. But when I used it on a regular basis WOW!! My results were phenonmenal. Fluidity is very challenging even for someone who works out on a regular basis (I jog about 6 days a week) but also a great place to start (believe me I didn't always jog). My problem areas are my thighs and stomach, it will really sculpt your legs and challenge your stomach. It will work your butt and your arms as well. The instructions are clear but the music is certainly for background not for motivation. I don't feel you really need a great track for this type of exercise because you are focusing on your body and movements, not so much the music (kind of like in yoga). If I were to complain about anything it would be the barre itself, I would have liked it to be more sturdy, but again a great workout for all over toning and losing weight.",1261440000,28,963,4.210810810810811
8302279,5,B001FQE4IW,I purchased my Fluidity Bar years ago and LOVE it but lost the DVDS. It's great to find them on Amazon and pick the one or ones I want. Michelle's workouts show her own variations of the Barre Method and great body weight exercises. They compare to the Barre Method by being  harder and longer. Fantastic for those who love to work at a bar and get a tough workout that makes you feel incredible and look even better.,1252022400,20,417,4.2784810126582276
