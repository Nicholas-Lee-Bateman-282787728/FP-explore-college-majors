8564437,5,B00B94VPRI,"From the length of the review you can see I really liked the documentary. Some of the details below are from my supplementary reading

This is a PBS production. It was shot in Berenty Private Reserve in Madagasar-- the only Island  where Lemurs occur in the wild
The Amazon product comment mentions group exclusion as one of the problems-- this is not the case.
This is the story of a group of Ring Tail Lemurs-- ring Tails spend much of their time in trees but they are the Lemurs that spend most time on the ground. They are also the most studied.
There are some 100 species of lemur on Madagascar

Made in the 1990's
 This Documentary was made in the mid 1990's so isn't as crisp as David Attenborough's Madagasat
Attenborough covered a wide range of Lemurs in his documentary along with a wide variety of other wildlife.
There was a moderate coverage on ring tailed lemurs in various environments along with a bonus special feature that followed a group of ringtails mainly through the eyes of two nursing mothers and one other female lemur who had recently lost her infant. This snapshot covered a two week period of drought conditions

A  LEMUR'S TALE
4 mothers--5 infants
A Lemur's tale follows 4 mothers with approximately 2 week old infants for some 8 plus months. ( from soon after the birth of their infants to the next mating season.  Lemur's are mainly herbivores. The narrator mentions the seasons at stages throughout the DVD
Females are dominate to males, and and your status matters. If you are a dominant female you get the choice of the best available food and feed first, if you are of low status you get the less desirable food and feed last so you infant is less likely to do well.
There is a young male with a mother of high status
A young female with a mother of high status
An Albino male with a mother of medium status. The Albino infant was all white except for the Black mouth and nasal area and blue eyes and the characteristic black and white rings on the tail. The foot pads are pink-- usually black.
There are a set of twins born to a mother of lowly rank ( one male, one female )

The troupe.
The troupe is some 27 strong with 8 adult males.
( it is difficult to work out what the group is composed of. This is my guess 4 Mothers with 5 infants and 8 Adult males-- with 10 others
Details on age and gender
Several will from last year's offspring, some will be young adults and others slightly older adults before breeding age.
Females first give birth about 3 years old and usually have one infant. Twins are rare in the wild , sometimes they just occuras here and at other times may occur because there is a plentiful supply of food. Females tend to breed each year.
Females stay in the group they are born in, while most young males move on.once they have reached maturity
Males are sexually mature at 3 years but it may be some years before they breed as it is usually the dominant that breed, but lesser males may breed
The mature young  males in a group tend to move out of the troupe after 3--5 years and try to find a new group to move into.
Dominant males ( dominant to other males ) get better food and are more likely to reproduce, so it is hard for the non dominant males as they are at the bottom of the troupe )
So my guess is that the 4 mothers and 5 infants we follow are all the live births in this troupe that year -- but I may well be wrong.
The editors may not have included others as it would make it diffult to follow each one -- how do you tell them apart.-- in this group you can
Females are fertile for only a few hours once a year, so breeding gets the males squaring off among each other
The females tend to stagger the time they are fertile, so they are not all fertile on the same day -- it is spread out over a brief period of a few weeks to a month
I have made a brief comment on the mating season  at the bottom, this DVD has a good stink fight but the presumed non dominant male losses his nerve after all the tail scenting with his wrist scent glands.

The infants stories
The documentary follows the young lemurs across time. As I remember it we see them at 3 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 4 months, 5 months then at one or two other points.
One follows the lemurs daily routine, awake, sun bathe, travel, search for food, noon nap, further travel, feed etc. one rarely sees the lemurs drinking..
One sees the infants on their mother's chest ( this only occurs in the first 1--2 weeks ) and later on her back. One sees the mothers suckling and grooming their young.
As the young lemurs grow one sees their first cautious steps away from their mothers-- either on the ground or going up low lying branches.
As they get a bit older one see their mothers letting them have playtime-- initally this is fairly gentle , but as they get an bit older and more confident it is more vigorous and venturesome. The twins are much smaller and develop more slowly and it is some time before they join the games. When they are quite a lot older they join their mothers by walking quite long distances on the ground.

One of the things I liked about the documentary is getting an idea of how large a lemur looks at say 1 month, 2 months,5 months, (typical age at weaning),7-8 months--about the time of the next mating cycle and one year. Females tend to have their first infant around 3. Males and females of the same age are about the same size.
An adult lemur is about the size of a domestic cat
The growing lemurs continue to suckle till about 5 months, some longer. Their mothers have weaning wars with them as they try to wean their infants, prior to the next mating season

Over the 8 month period the young lemurs have learned skills in climbing, recognising danger, and learning a array of techniques of feeding -- both in what to eat and also how to eat it. One interesting food sprang up on the forest floor after the rainy season-- you had to know how to get through the thick skin and how to position your head to get the contents out.

2 of the 5 infants do not survive the first year-- I won't say how they die, but one was of common causes, the other appeared to be of a rare cause. One sees these  dying/ died young lemurs and the heart felt distress of their mothers.
One young lemur is severely injured and is unable to get on it's mother's back-- you see her desperate attempt to carry it in her hands and arms--  (they are not designed for this )
On an average only 50% of infants survive to one year.
All this is rather moving for the viewer
The hardest time for the young lemurs to survive is the first few months. They are very small and once they become active, rather boisterous. They are born near the end of the dray season ,so it can be hard for there mothers to produce enough milk.
The rains then come and there is plenty of food ,but being small they can die of cold.
If they can get through the first 5 months they are much more likely to survive
They start on solids at 1 month and tend to be weaned at five months.
Also at about five mothers they tend to follow their mothers on there travels to find food-- quite a journey. Their mothers will give them a ride if they are tired. When they were younger she would carry them on her back. The twins being less developed travel on their mother's back for longer.

The cycle goes full circle with the next mating season , with the usually placid males getting quite aggressive towards other males, with standoffs, stink fighting etc and in the end the female chooses her mate.

The narrator is very reasonable
The music is non intrusive.
One hears some of the Lemurs vocalisations-- a definite plus along with some of the noises of their habitat.
Brown lemurs and some sifakas also put in brief appearances
Territorial disputes are not shown , but scent markings by both males and females are. There is a brief but good view of the male wrist gland area ( spur) used in marking saplings, trees and there tails.

Summary
I found this a very rewarding documentary and a good supplement to Attenborough's Madagasar ( that is on a lot more that ring tailed lemurs. )

One gets to see the development of the infants. The mothers with single infants have infants that grow faster-- there is no obvious difference between high status and medium status babies
The twins have slower development , no doubt partly due to being twins and also being born to a low ranking mother.
This documentary answered some of the questions I had about lemurs and reinforced a number of other things I had seen or read. The photography was very good
The narrator was good

Being able to watch 5 young lemurs for the first 8 months or more of their difficult lives was very informative and interesting and at points very moving. I will certainly be watching this documentary several further times to learn more but also to freeze frame images so  as  to see more detail. Eg how they use their hands to eat tamarind pods, of how mothers groom their very young infants-- the infants are so small and there hands quite large. I watch with interest as the mother gently moves her infant around to groom the various areas
Highly recommended",1429660800,2,9136,4.34232121922626
