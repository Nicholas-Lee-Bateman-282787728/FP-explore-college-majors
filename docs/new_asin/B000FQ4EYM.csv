2581768,5,B000FQ4EYM,Not just another JWWM (John Wayne War Movie) but good history re-enacted.  Iwo was a tough gig and I never tire from honoring the men who fought there by educating myself about it from as many angles as I can.,1381622400,,209,4.225
2581769,5,B000FQ4EYM,"This film is not difficult to review, nor is the story complicated to express an opinion for the message remains clear and certainly not without its overall importance well beyond entertainment.  ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" became a view of history from the commentary of several who remember those early days of 1945.  Every day we lose another survivor of that battle and a film of this importance can act only as a reminder that the footprints of those who served, died or survived assured us all that we are a part of this world due to their relentless service not only to a country but to a world.

Iwo Jima took the lives of many men on both sides of the conflict in the Pacific.  A few names immediately come to mind beyond the many whose lives were either ended or forever changed during this horrific battle.  Sgt. Mike Strank (whom they called ""Pappy"" because he was the oldest, born in Jarbino, Czechoslovakia November 10th (curiously the anniversary of the founding of the Marine Corps( 1919, and died on March 1st 1945 never realizing the impact of the flag raising had on the balance of the war and the millions at home.  Marine private Franklin Sousley, Cpl. Harlon Block, made up three of the six who raised the U.S. flag atop Mt. Suribachi, and three of the six who died on that rock pile in the Ryuku Island chain.  The survivors, Navy Corpsman (recipient of the Navy Cross)John Bradley, Rene Gagnon, PFC Ira Hayes, all now a part of history, told many times the story of the flag raising but what was always more important was the reminder of that day and the men who fought and died there.  The film, ""Sands of Iwo Jima"" had little to do with the actual battle, but it tells a tale of a platoon of 1940's Marines, a tale so personal and enlightening that it presented the Marine Corps as it was - the cast and swagger of John Wayne, the presence of Forrest Tucker, the laughter and light-heartedness of Wally Cassell became the presence of a cross section of American youth offering all they had including their lives was the true representation of this remarkable film.  We are proud of our Warriors of Today, and because of films such as ""Sands of Iwo Jima""  and its remarkable history, remind us that these too, were the Warriors that made our lives possible.  Semper Fidelis and Saddle Up (literal translation: let's get it done).",1380412800,6,2346,4.561904761904762

2581778,4,B000FQ4EYM,"John Wayne takes over a squad of Marine recruits, trains them and leads them in battle. Of course, the problems Wsyne has training the recruits are explored in detail, as well as the squads first combat takeing a island from the Japs.  The grand finale is the battle of Iwo Jima.  There is plenty of action and this movie was very popular when first seen.  The Duke was nominated for an Oscar for this movie, his only nomination until True Grit.  In truth, Wayne does a far better acting job  in She Wore A Yellow Ribbon than he did in Sands of Iwo Jima.  This is a standard WWII film from this era of Hollywood.

2581779,4,B000FQ4EYM,"The story line is typical for a John Wayne war movie. Hard nosed and everyone hates him. In the end the finally realize that he was a great person. Just doing his job. This movie itself is a little hard to find. I bought this without realizing that it was an imported movie. Don't get me wrong, I would have bought it anyway. It's just that it surprised me after I received it. The movie is a really clean copy and the sound track is great. It's just that it comes up with Korean subtitles. You have to turn subtitles off. Like I said though, I would have bought it anyway. If you like John Wayne and you don't have this in your library. Get it. You won't be disappointed.",1403136000,,672,4.176923076923077

2581784,5,B000FQ4EYM,"The Sands of Iwo Jima, 1947 film

This film had the three surviving flag raisers: Pfc. Rene A. Gagnon, Pfc. Ira H. Hayes, PM3C John H. Bradley. This film was dedicated to the USMC, who aided in its production. The screenplay was written by Harry Brown, the author of ""A Walk in the Sun"", and has some of the actors from that earlier film. It begins after the Battle of Guadalcanal. The men are sent to New Zealand to rest, retrain, and get more replacements. Sgt. John M. Stryker is the squad leader. He will learn the men what isn't in the books; their lives will depend on this. Sgt. Stryker leads the men in their drills and exercises. One soldier, Conway, joined for the family tradition. Stryker drives his men hard, they need training. He also has a family problem. The men have liberty in Wellington.

Stryker advises Conway against a long-term commitment. Stryker uses a novel training technique for bayonet drill [comic relief?]. Then the men get sent to their target: Tarawa. Stryker warns them of a difficult combat, no matter what the Navy guns and fliers have done. Actual scenes from combat are used. There are realistic combat scenes. Lives are spent to destroy enemy machine gun nests and take their objective. A few men are pinned down and short of ammunition. One returns for bandoliers, but tarries for a cup of coffee. The delay costs lives. ""What kept you?"" The marines must hold their position in spite of reduced strength. Tarawa was secured after four days of battle. The survivors leave the island for retraining in Hawaii. When mistakes are made, men die needlessly.

Sgt. Stryker learns about civilian life in Honolulu. Civilians also have a hard life. The unit has been trained and tested in battle. They are shipped out to another Pacific island with three airfields. ""War is trading lives for real estate."" When the naval bombardment ends, the men move out to attack. They can advance only so far. A tank arrives to spread napalm. Rocket launchers are used as well. In the morning they advance on Mount Suribachi. They will raise a flag when they reach the top. Sgt. Stryker will not make it to the top. ""Things just turned out that way."" The famous flag raising is recreated, a symbol of the coming victory.

This film recreates history and provides lessons that are educational. I think the screenplay of Harry Brown and his advisors made this the best WW II film if not the most successful.",1394236800,2,2423,4.694117647058824
