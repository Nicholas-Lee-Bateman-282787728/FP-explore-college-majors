8697107,4,B00S2SYO18,This was a gift for my Dad (his 91st) birthday - he said it was perfect.  He loves history and architecture,1518307200,,107,4.095238095238095
8697108,5,B00S2SYO18,bought this solely for the Petra program. having visited it is a wonderful informative documentary that I wished I would have watched again just before traveling. it is gratifying that so many brilliant researchers continue to pore over this ancient city and a blessing that it sits within the confines of a moderate and prosperous Muslim country not likely to become threatened by radicals.,1506556800,,391,5.125

8697112,5,B00S2SYO18,"The first segment featured Rome's Colosseum, including considerable coverage of underground areas for water transport, animal cages, etc. Also featured was a segment detailing how animals were lifted up in cages and then released onto the arena floor - some innovative engineering! I was also amazed (and taken aback) at the scale of the gore that took place at that site - far too much for me.

Next came the Lost City - Petra, found only by traversing a relatively long, very deep, and narrow channel. The town is primarily dominated by burial sites (most/all looted), and incredible stone buildings carved into the mountainside. The DVD also accounted for how they obtained water in the middle of that very dry desert, but could not explain why a large number (about 30,000) of people would want to live there and undertake such a large building effort.",1437782400,,856,4.903448275862069

8697114,3,B00S2SYO18,"It is a very nice men's robe and I would have kept it if I wanted a long robe, but I am about 5'10"" tall and it came to almost the floor. It really does not look any thing like the advertised picture. It for that reason alone that I am returning the robe..",1433980800,,256,3.759259259259259
8697115,5,B00S2SYO18,"If you appreciate art and architecture watch this documentary. If you are in construction and engineering watch this documentary. If you ever decide to visit any of these three sites watch this before your visit since knowing what it took these geniuses to construct these structures and cities that even some 1,500 years later they happen to be around, will get you admire those civilizations much more before arrival. These are civilizations without any of today's technologies and seeing what engineering miracles they used so many centuries ago is just absolutely mind bugling. Bravo.

Collosseum - Roman Death Trap:
The Colosseum is a monument to Roman imperial power and cruelty. 1,500 years ago its graceful lines and harmonious proportions concealed a highly efficient design and advanced construction methods that made hundreds of arches out of 100,000 tons of stone. In its elliptical arena, tens of thousands of gladiators, slaves, prisoners and wild animals met their deaths. Ancient texts report lions and elephants emerging from beneath the floor, as if by magic, to ravage gladiators and people condemned to death. Then, just as quickly, the Colosseum could be flooded with so much water that ships could engage in sea battles. Could these legends be true? Now, with access to one of the world's most protected world heritage sites, archaeologists and engineers team up to re-create ancient Roman techniques to build a 25-foot lifting machine and trap-door system capable of releasing a wolf into the Colosseum's arena for the first time in.

Petra - Lost City of Stone:
More than 2,000 years ago, the thriving city of Petra rose up in the bone-dry desert of what is now Jordan. An oasis of culture and abundance, the city was built by wealthy merchants who carved spectacular temple-tombs into its cliffs, raised a monumental Great Temple and devised an ingenious system that channeled water to vineyards, bathhouses, fountains and pools. But following a catastrophic earthquake and a slump in its desert trade routes, Petra's unique culture faded and was lost to most of the world for nearly 1,000 years.

Hagia Sophia - Istanbul's Ancient Mystery:
Istanbul's magnificent Hagia Sophia has survived on one of the world's most active seismic faults, which has inflicted a dozen devastating earthquakes since Hagia Sophia was built in 537 AD. As Istanbul braces for the next big quake, a team of architects and engineers is investigating Hagia Sophia's seismic secrets.",1424563200,8,2483,5.187032418952619
