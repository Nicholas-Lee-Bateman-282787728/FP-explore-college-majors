7867653,1,6304309236,"This video will make you think two things; 1. The U.F.C is a joke! 2. Larry, Curly, and Moe govern the state of michigan for making such stupid rules!",979776000,,150,4.206896551724138
7867654,2,6304309236,"The first bout-style UFC, with no tournament.  Some fairly good fights, with Frye-Bitteti being the best.  The superfight between Ken Shamrock and  Dan Severn ranks in my top 3 'Worst Fights Ever'.  Just pathetic.  I'd  advise you to stop the tape before it starts, but it's like a car-wreck;  it's so horrible, you just have to watch.  On the other hand, there's  usually some blood at a good car-wreck.",965606400,,404,4.739130434782608
7867655,3,6304309236,"This installment of the UFC received a lot of press mostly due to Michigans' attempt to cancel the show  a few weeks before the show. A lot of the earlier UFC's were used as ""proof"" of it's violent nature.  While the event went on as planned, a few rules were placed just before  showtime. First off, open handed strikes had to be used, and pressure point  strikes were disallowed. I think only a few fighters used open-handed  strikes, while every fighter did heed the pressure point rule.  The show  was a change from the previous 9, no tournament but a fight card format. It  proved to be a winning formula as every fight was entertaining, except for  the Superfight. An inspirational performance by Mark Shultz and an  unbelievable fight between Don Frye and Amaury Bitetti highlighted this  show. But it was the Superfight that absolutely angered the crowd, and  embarrassed all fans and supporters of the sport. Ken Shamrock and Dan  Severn basically slapped each other for 20+ minutes, until they finally hit  the mat for the last 5 minutes. While there was strategy involved, it's  very hard to defend the lack of effort by each fighter. The most  disappointing fight ever; worse than any work or ground war. I try not to  ruin a review by giving the results, but this is the exception. With all  the media surrounding this card, the Superfight may have calmed the  good-doer's and politicians, I guess that's a good thing.",964137600,2,1431,4.720647773279352
7867656,1,6304309236,there is only two reasons to buy this video.  schultz takedowns and bitteti's toughness.  i was a little disappointed in frye however.  this shows his lack of finishing skills. easily the worst ufc. unless you like  watching two guys slap each other,956188800,,249,4.857142857142857
7867657,3,6304309236,"No tournament here, only bouts, so that killed the anticipation of advancing fighters. The Goodrich/Shultz fight is good, but embarassing for the veteran. Mark Hall, never gets much of a chance to fight. Severn and  Shamrock opt for a game of ""Ring around the Rosey"". But the Don  Frye/Amaury Bittete fight is excellent, probably the must punishing of any  UFC.",933379200,,361,4.983333333333333
7867658,3,6304309236,"The UFC goes to a fight card instead of the old tournament style, with boring results. With the fight card you can't root for your favorite fighter to go all the way and you get to see them only once the whole  video. The super fight was a joke. Shamrock and Severn just walk around  looking at each most of the match. This video is for the hard core fan  only!",922060800,,361,4.056338028169014
7867659,4,6304309236,"All of the fights were just a single fight; no tournament.  The only bad fight was the last one, the Superfight.  It might be the worst UFC fight ever.  Frye vs. Bitetti was a war.  Great buy as long as you don't watch  the Superfight.",916272000,,235,4.133333333333334
