After I bought this for my wife & she was extremely disappointed that it wasn't the same movie, I did some digging.  Apparently the company that remastered the DVD used the United Kingdom dubbed version.  THIS CHANGES THE NAMES OF THE CHARACTERS, THE CHARACTER VOICES, & THE MUSIC.  Not sure why the company used the UK version or why they just didn't give you an option for having a language selection for US vs UK.  My guess as to why anyone who gave better than 2 stars for this movie 1. Never saw it as a kid, 2. Saw it in the UK & never in the US, 3. Just simply does not remember anything about the movie.  So, if you have no care about those things then by all means purchase away.  At least the story itself didn't change.

I admit it, I am a child of the 80's.  I am also a huge fan of the Smurfs.  I grew up with the little blue characters that had names which reflected their personalities.  I also loved the adventures of Johan and Peewit which aired alongside the Smurf stories. When I first saw this film it was back in 1986 on ABC.  The version was an American dub of the 1973 cartoon ""La flute a six schtroumpfs"" made by Belvision, Fr. named after the comic of the same name published in 1960 by Dupuis. Some of the voice actors were the same but the Smurfs in this movie had higher voices and were more hyper than the Saturday morning cartoon versions done by Hanna Barbara.  The Smurfs in this film are more impish and pixie like compared to the Hanna Barbara Smurfs, but in essence, they are the same.  Peyo oversaw the production of both series and made sure that each followed the idea and design he intended for them.  One is just older than the other!  The Hanna Barbara series came out nearly 10 years after this film!

This version of the film is the British dub, and the character's have changed.  Their names are Anglicized.  Johan being named John, and Pirlouit now called ""William"".  It was odd hearing Peewit speak with a British accent, but then it also was kinda nice.  Johan always spoke with an English accent so that wasn't too far of a jump, however this Johan is far more reserved and almost aloof compared to the conniving and fun Peewit (ahem William).  He has a more mature sounding voice as well, it is lower than the US dubbed Johan.

What I loved about this film was that it was a DIRECT translation of the French version!  The music is original and the lyrics are in english!  This is wonderful!  The US dub had different music altogether with different lyrics.  I also love the jokes.  They are more tongue and cheek and closer to the original comic!

Despite the negative feedback this film has received, I believe this is the closest interpretation to the original story in English that I've seen.  I also feel like the characters are closer to the way Peyo intended them to be outside of the original French/Belgium story.  I also feel like the audience expected to have a ""Saturday Morning Smurf"" movie.  Something this film is certainly not.

This film was always a foreign film, and it is this story which introduced the Smurfs to the world not vice versa! If there was any ""MUST SEE"" Smurf film, this is the one.  This is the one to watch before all the others... before the animated series, before the new CGI movies!  This is the first story which introduced the Smurfs to the world, and this is quintessential Smurf canon outside of reading the comics for yourself!",1349049600,2,2866,4.746963562753036
445445,1,6302250161,"Okay the description on the back is an outright lie. My mom got me the DVD for my birthday, not realizing that the dub was totally different then both American versions I remember from when I was a child. Both of us were very disappointed. She ended up getting the original VHS version for me. Because of this disappointment, I will likely do some research on DVD releases of old cartoons. Likely I will stick to buying old VHS tapes for my more favorite movies and shows (especially cartoons) in addition to DVDs.",1347926400,5,514,4.537634408602151

We were very disappointed in the movie because the voices of the characters were not the familiar ones we remember, and they were definitely not the same as the cartoon episodes that were recently released.  Why would the voices be changed?  It really ruined the movie for us.  If we had known, we would never have purchased this movie.  For me sound is very important, and not only the voices, but the music as well was not the familiar tune or arrangements.  The sound quality was fine, but we did not enjoy the new voices and music.",1347235200,2,666,4.462809917355372
445447,3,6302250161,"The Smurfs and the Magic Flute was directed by the Smurfs creator Peyo and was released to theaters in 1976 in Belgium, and 1979 in the United Kingdom. In 1981, NBC aired The Smurfs from Hanna-Barbera and it was an instant success. An English dubbed version of The Smurfs and the Magic Flute came out to theaters in the USA in 1983. Despite being disliked by critics, the move was a box-office success. Over the years it has been only available on VHS, but never on DVD, until now.

The movie centers on a young squire, Johan, and his goofy sidekick, Peewit, (Peyo created the characters in 1952 and then created the Smurfs in 1958). Peewit gets a hold of a flute that has only six holes. Whoever is playing the flute can control other people by making them dance.

A stranger, Matthew McCreep, steels the flute from Peewit and uses the flute to rob people. The King sends Johan and Peewit to retrieve the flute or their kingdom may fall. They fail at their first attempt to get the flute back, causing them to seek the help of a wizard who magically sends them to Smurfland.

Papa Smurf and the other Smurfs agree to make a new flute for them. Before the Smurfs can hand them the flute, Johan and Peewit are zapped back to their world. The Smurfs journey to the other world to help stop McCreep before he takes over the castle.

Shout! Factory has brought The Smurfs and the Magic Flute to DVD, but they used the UK Dubbed version and not the English Dubbed version for some odd reason. So the voices are different, and the names have been changed, such as Peewit is now William and Johan is now John! The picture quality is pretty good, up until the ending. There are a few extras - image gallery, glossary of Smurf terms, The Smurf Story, character guide, etc.

This is not the best animated movie I have ever seen. It takes forever for a Smurf to actually show up! I can only recommend the movie to Smurf fans and new fans may not appreciate it for what it is.",1346198400,13,1964,4.36986301369863

I had to get this for my nieces, i remembered this film from my time growing in Europe and bought a copy for my nieces. They loved it ! Although the Smurfs don't appear on screen until 20 mins into the film this did not detract from the overall enjoyment. Good family entertainment !",1345507200,3,398,4.25
445451,1,6302250161,"If you watched this film while in America as a child in the theater or on VHS this dub if very much different. Despite clearly stating on the cover of the box ""The Original Full-Length Feature Film"" this is an outright lie. Had you watched the film in America this is not the film you watched. The British dub not only has different voice actors but it also has different dialog, background music, names for characters and sound effects. The dub change completely changes the tone of the film to the point where it is unrecognizable.

I am very disappointed and will be writing to the distributor that I believe I should receive a refund. The box clearly has the names of the American Dub characters which is very misleading. You would think the description ""A magical flute is just what Court Jester Peewit needs to play delightful tunes"" would be the American Dubbed version since in the British version this character is never called Peewit he is called William and he is not the Jester in the British version he is the Court Bard. This wording alone is deceptive. I consider it an outright lie to describe the DVD with the American Dub and only have the English Dub.

Character renames are rampant!
Peewit - William
Sir Johan - John
Matthew McCreep - Earl LeCreepe (pronounced Oarl not Earl)
Earl Flatbroke - Lord Mumford
Homnibus the Wizard - Omnibus the Sorcerer
Handy Smurf- Handyman Smurf
Brainy Smurf - Smurf (once called Smarty Smurf)
Grouchy Smurf - Smurf

There is no other language available on the DVD and no subtitles at all. The film is also a widescreen 16:9 feature film that is presented in 4:3 format so the screen is shrunken down to an odd box in the middle of any television that is not an old square Tv. A square presentation of a rectangle film inside a rectangle sized tv is utterly stupid. I uploaded a photograph for anyone who has no idea what I just said.

Do not buy this DVD in America if you want the movie that was in theaters in America, on Tv in America or on VHS sold in America. Arrow Flims, Fabulousfilms.com, Shout Factory and Peyo should be ashamed.",1345248000,22,2090,4.535809018567639

The voice acting ranges from passable to terrible, and the songs with their lyrics aren't as catchy as the American English dub version. I'd give this one a serious pass unless you're that desperate to own a copy of the movie.

An important thing of note is that Imavision, a Canadian video distributor, also released this movie in North America with the English and French voice tracks, and that also has the United Kingdom English dub, which is how I first came to know this problem.",1345161600,8,711,4.688

445464,3,6302250161,"So let's start by saying this is pre-80s Hanna Barbera mega popular Smurfs tv series material. It's a 1976 original Belgian film though the English version came over and was shown in the US in 1983 due to the Smurfs being so popular. So don't expect Papa Smurf or any of the other smurfs to have the same voice you're probably use to in the Hanna Barbera series. The first half of the movie is pretty much Johan and Peewit heavy. The story has already been summarized above so I'll move on to other details.

The movie is about 70 mins, it's quite charming and has that European cartoon feel to it. The movie did feel rushed at the end, I think another good 10 or 20 mins could have really flushed out the story a little more and made it more satisfying. It felt like at the end just time to wrap up things like it was a television episode which was disappointing. On the plus side the picture is crisp and the colors pop and it seems like a decent job of remastering was done here BUT, and this is strange but the last 2 mins the picture goes from beautiful to some un-mastered grainy looking footage. I don't know how Shout Factory let this past but truth be known their standards have been dipping in recent times.

On top of all this the dub is not the North American dub but the UK dub which has different names for characters, this is just a straight port of the Region 2 dvd, Shout Factory put no work into this, the aspect ratio is awful as well, old style letterbox. Shout Factory will defend itself saying they only distributed it but they knew it's for the North American market they could have added the NA track. Lazy indeed. All the people finding the negative reviews unhelpful must be big Shout Factory fans, c'mon we are just telling the truth. Isn't that what people want,honest reviews?

The extras on here seem uninspired, most text based info (smurf terms, about the smurfs) that isn't that informative or entertaining, the font chosen especially makes it difficult to read, even if you've got great eye sight expect to be close to the screen to read the info and I was watching it on a big television. The only other extras are a few stills and art pages, also not that entertaining. Shout Factory really needs to do a better job with extras and also about quality control hence the lower score.",1344816000,6,2317,4.408878504672897

If you are looking for a strictly - Smurf movie then this may not be the right one since it is only half-Smurfs (and I don't remember some of the popular Smurf characters like Smurfette and Gargamuel being in it either) but it is a classic cartoon movie and entertaining in itself.

445467,3,6302250161,"This movie, which is based on the first Smurfs story that appeared in the Johan and Peewit comic book series, made its appearance in Europe several years before the Smurfs cartoon show and was dubbed into English and released in America in 1983 when they characters became popular there. In the story, one of the lead characters, Peewit the court minstrel, finds a six-holed flute that makes whoever listens to it dance to its tune, though extended playing causes them to pass out. A thief named Matthew McCreep finds out about this flute and steals it from Peewit so he can use it to rob the townsfolk of their valuables. Unable to stop him on their own, Johan and Peewit turn to Homnibus the enchanter, who transports them to the land of the Smurfs where they get help from them in the form of creating a second magic flute so they can retrieve the stolen first flute and return it to the Smurfs.

The movie is fairly entertaining, though it is obviously made with children in mind due to the songs featured in it. The animation is decent, a little better than that of Hanna-Barbera. While none of the voice cast from the cartoon show did voices for any of the characters in this movie, there are some notable sound-alike versions of Frank Welker's Hefty and Bill Callaway's Clumsy that appear on different Smurf characters featured here. Still, I would rather listen to Don Messick doing Papa Smurf's voice (or Jonathan Winters in the 2011 movie, since Don is eternally unavailable) than the voice actor selected for his character.

For what it's worth, the movie is recommended to any hardcore Smurf fan. I only wish that it's more available for American audiences in DVD format or in Blu-Ray format.",1321056000,5,1704,4.695652173913044

This is an animated version of the original comic story that first introduced the Smurfs.

The video quality is great for an old 1970's cartoon movie--they did a really good job remastering it.  This is the British dub, which is different from the one it had when it was released in the US.
