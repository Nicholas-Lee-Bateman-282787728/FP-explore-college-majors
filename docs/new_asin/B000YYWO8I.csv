8234483,1,B000YYWO8I,"If you want to waste 10 or 20 yrs studying this book then that's fine. Don't expect miracles from this book. I emailed Mark. And, asked him about the changing of positions, Cause, the tabs on this book won't help at all when you're going down the fret board. And, All the modes etc...That he instructs you to play in all keys and rhythms.

Well, he emailed me and actually just repeated what it was indicated on the book.

If you just want to play useless modes that won't integrate and get to where you want to go? Then go for it. Otherwise my opinion is; This is one of the worse books I ever came across. Waste of money and time. Useless. there's a whole bunch of systems that are way better. The book in my Opinion doesn't make much sense at all. And, I'm very familiar with the modes at studied to advance theory. Don't expect to be playing any gigs soon using this book. You'll still need a lot more material than this. You'll just probably get bored with it; And, it'll be just collecting dust.",1404777600,,1001,4.291005291005291
8234484,5,B000YYWO8I,This is a jump into a really solid understanding of what your guitar is capable of doing. Building understanding and confidence are the basics where one really begins to shine. Every player needs to get a command of the guitar and serious study will provide this for you.,1381622400,,271,4.666666666666667
8234485,5,B000YYWO8I,"I had purchased the book a few years ago, and plucked away at it now and then.  But being able to actually HEAR what things are supposed to sound like, makes ALL the difference in the world.  I highly recommend both the book and DVD!

Extremely well done product!

Thank you!",1370822400,,275,4.333333333333333
8234486,1,B000YYWO8I,"I have been working with the guitar for five years which includes, music, music theory and applying both to the guitar. I purchased this DVD shortly after beginning and was so intimidated and overwhelmed I set it aside.
After five years of learning songs and having gained an understanding of the layout of the fretboard and music theory I revisited this DVD. I still find it to be terrible.
For me this DVD is so disjointed I don't know how anyone could make useful sense out of any of it.

After reading the other reviews I guess I don't have a clue.
If another beginner can get anything out of this DVD, other than total confusion, they should be well on their way.",1299369600,,668,4.430894308943089
8234487,3,B000YYWO8I,"I would not recommend this video to beginners. I've been playing guitar for over 12 years and I was still pretty bored with this video - not because I knew everything being taught, but just because it was presented in such a boring way. But I guess if you can push through the monotony and learn what is being taught, you'll be a very skilled player.",1278460800,,350,4.318181818181818
8234488,3,B000YYWO8I,"75% of this DVD is him playing guitar exercises. Different patterns of scales in different speeds where you're supposed to be playing with him. There is only a little bit of actual informative DVD but a lot of that is very basic knowledge. He focuses mainly on the major scale leaving other important scales in the dark (he does skim over the pentatonic). The music in the DVD is very dry, he might have played 3 or 4 interesting licks in the whole DVD. He doesn't give examples of how to apply the scale creatively. This is a pure theory DVD. In my opinion this DVD just tells you what the scales are, gives you practice exercises, but you have to figure out how to creatively use the scales yourself.",1247788800,3,702,4.407692307692308
8234489,5,B000YYWO8I,"This DVD is amazing.  The teacher starts at the beginning and assumes you know nothing about the guitar - nothing is taken for granted.  There are years of instruction/application on this DVD.  The quality of the DVD is very good and the attention to detail is superb.  You would spend hundreds (if not thousands) of dollars to get the same amount of information from a private instructor.  Efficient, concise, generous amount of info.  Simply the best visual guitar instruction to-date at a rediculously low price.",1208995200,7,515,5.0
8234490,5,B000YYWO8I,"I believe that the ""Total scales and Techniques"" DVD is the single best learning resource that the beginning or advanced guitarist can find.  Mark John Sternal has created the ""complete toolbox"" of the really useful tools that you need to learn the fretboard, playing techniques, and other really cool stuff. From start to finish, each section is explained and demonstrated very well. This is by far the most comprehensive help I've ever had toward reaching my own learning goals with the guitar. Thank you!",1196640000,8,507,5.035714285714286
