There are herrings aplenty here, courtesy of writer Justin Charles, who has a knack for subverting audience expectations by neatly playing into them.

Magnificent and crisp direction in character force Steven E. Barnes who plays the magnetic ""Chris"" who takes this drama flick and turns it into a minor classic of the genre. The only thing we can be sure of as the story starts to unfold is that there is a bag of money found, a ludicrously large amount will go missing for some time in a bad dope exchange, the the movie plays little on that down side of urban street drug living, and so the story takes off.

While Steven E. Barnes gets most of the attention in Be easy due to his stunningly excellent performance as deranged but composed and out of control Chris, the movie is actually the story of Khalil (Jamar Whelch) who has a new born but is lazy and immature with his babies mother Dawn played by Laconya Clemons who's Lucky's sister and also Khalil's close friend.

Now, I won't give anything away about Barnes's character Chris as saying too much can spoil a minor twist towards the end of the film. It's not like you don't see it coming, but the way Steven plays Chris is just so excellent that is makes watching the story develop up to the point a true treat.

His performance here is deserving of a Junior Academy Award if there was such a thing for independent films maybe. Steven's powerful portrayal of a young man on the edge of insanity keeps you glued to the screen through the first two thirds of the movie.

Justin Charles does an equally impressive job providing an opposite personality for Steven to play off of. Lucky is sort of the conscience of the film, the innocence that the audience sort of feels when some of the ""deeds"" are going down.

However, as the film moves onto the climax in the third act things begin to become a little generic, especially the gunfight towards the end and the final development of Charles's character. You know it's going to happen and it plays out in exactly the way you expect but don't want to see. The conclusion to the film is a disappointment due to the excellent performances by both Steven and Charles that drive the first two acts.

Despite that one complaint, Be easy is a great flick. It's just one that leads you along a great path, only to give you a finale that doesn't live up to the excellence of the overall movie.",1206748800,,2586,4.512820512820513
