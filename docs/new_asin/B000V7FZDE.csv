8375785,5,B000V7FZDE,"I'm impressed that there is no review about this DVD. Great image and sound is not always the case with Impro-Jazz Spain DVDs. This is an exception. It's great all around. Don't miss one of the great players of the swing era that here goes from swing and mainstream to be-bop, blues to the roots of rock and roll (with the master singer Big Joe Turner) and two great bands, including Sir Charles Thompson, Emmett Berry, Jimmy Witherspoon, Humphrey Lyttelton etc. Plus? Well, no doubt that Woody Allen would love this DVD.",1474156800,,521,4.673913043478261
