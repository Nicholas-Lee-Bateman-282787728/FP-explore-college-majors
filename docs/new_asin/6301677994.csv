342443,4,6301677994,"This is a very interesting TV series even I hadn't been in it!  I was only an extra for more than a month.  The series had the main characters the same through out.  Robert Preston and Delta Burke were the nicest people to work with.  The entire case were just like family.  The mini series ran for five nights which works out to about 300 minutes.  I regret I didn't get a copy back then, but would give anything for a copy now!!!  It's truly worth seeing!!  I am very proud to be a very small part of such a great series.  I have purchased several copies of two parts but need the whole series.  Any leads on finding a full series of copies, I would greatly apprecite!!!
Enjoy any part of the series - it's worth it!!!

342444,5,6301677994,"I ordered this. This is only episode one out of four that were made as a mini-series in 1979, but this is a complete movie in itself and much better than the other episodes, almost like they were an afterthought. The series was continued in 1980 with a different cast.",1300492800,3,268,4.38
342445,5,6301677994,"This is my favorite movie. It is about a family moving west in 1844. It makes you feel happy when you watch it, it's hard to describe , but I really recommend it. It is a wonderful family movie.",1167868800,,194,4.0
342446,5,6301677994,"I watched this movie for the first time as a small child and then several times after as I was growing up.  This movie portrays the struggles of a Pioneer Family with more honesty, beauty, and heart than any other film I have ever seen.  It takes you through the highs and lows that the family experiences but leaves you with a hope and warm feeling instead of a heavy heart.  After watching this movie I guarantee you will want to share the experience with others.  The only negative I can think of is that this movie is far too unknown.  I can't say enough about The Chisholms except that if you don't see it you are missing out on a great example of why movies are made.",1092528000,3,673,4.2265625
342447,5,6301677994,A wonderful and powerful drama portraying an early pioneering family risking everything leaving their eastern home to start anew out west. Great for families. Gives you a real feel for the brave families who had the courage to open up the west. You witness their losses and tragedies and their successes. You can see just how much a person can endure. The acting is terrific for all involved and the wonderful music of Aaron Copeland powerful and moving. A must for all families.,1009929600,7,479,4.783132530120482

The only thing I didn't like was the snakes. A little bit more than  this Kansas, raised in this city girl could handle, but definitely worth the price and time to watch it.  I'm very glad I purchased it. One of the few movies I've watched and taken notes as I watched it.  5 stars for sure.",1479945600,2,543,4.213592233009709

343003,2,6301677994,"I am a huge fan of shows like Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman, North and South, and just about anything about the old west or the pioneers. I just had to give this one a try, but this one I just didn't do it for me. Pretty good actors and actresses but the storyline just stunk in my humble opinion. The writers just were not that great it was very predictable at times, and sometimes just downright had me rolling my eyes. Plus it ends VERY abruptly with no closure to the story lines and on going characters plots etc. which I hate! So this one for me was pretty much just a rental as I will just turn around and resell it. Just not my kind of story telling.",1454198400,8,653,4.069767441860465

343005,4,6301677994,"I bought this because Ben Murphy was in it. As it turns out, I really enjoyed the series. There were a few discrepancies, things and phrases that would not have been available or used during the time frame this show was set in. Most probably won't even notice those discrepancies and even if they do, it still does not take away from the entertainment value. The characters are written well enough that you come to like them and know them. This is a good quality show for families to enjoy. It did leave a few question unanswered, but I can't say what those are without spoiling it for anyone who has not seen it. If you enjoy your entertainment without vulgarity and ugly language, I think you will enjoy this.",1445385600,10,711,4.476923076923077

The stories are about a family who encounters hardships and struggles traveling across the US from Virginia to California seeking a new start in life.

343146,5,6301677994,"I give five stars for the first disc alone, which contains the complete miniseries of 1979. These four episodes are superb, fully the equal of ""Lonesome Dove,"" and I can give no higher praise than that! As for the other two discs, I would advise that you skip them entirely, so as not to spoil the glorious emotional power that has been generated by the first one. Beginning in 1980, lesser actors play some of the well-established characters, and the production quality goes down, WAY down, to a routine TV series. The gorgeous Stacey Nelkin, as Bonnie Sue Chisholm in 1979, is replaced by Delta Burke in 1980, and the other principal roles, even those handled by the original actors, seem to be going through the motions, sleepwalking. But I digress.

The first disc is a classic that should be placed in the pantheon of television and cinematic achievements. It is simply fantastic, from Chapter I through Chapter IV, and should have won multiple awards. Robert Preston's performance, as patriarch Hadley Chisholm, is worthy of the Best Actor of the Year Emmy - - and I say that by Oscar standards! Rosemary Harris (Minerva Chisholm) is every bit as good, and I would place Ben Murphy (Will Chisholm) in that same category. In a smaller but intensely dramatic role, Sandra Griego is marvelous as Keewedinok. Besides everything else, only the 1979 miniseries contains the perfectly fashioned music score of themes from three of Aaron Copland's ballets (""Appalachian Spring,"" ""Billy the Kid,"" and ""Rodeo""), sensitively crafted by Elmer Bernstein.

To summarize, do indeed buy ""The Chisholms"" on DVD, finally available after 36 years of neglect, and watch the first disc (Chapters I to IV from 1979) over and over at a reasonable cost. And then forget the other two discs, which will only serve to ruin the euphoric feeling of cinematic brilliance.",1433808000,4,1848,4.938906752411576

343318,3,6301677994,"Solid frontier action with Robert Preston headlining as the father of the Chisolms taking his family westward after losing his land in Virginia and deciding to set out for the greener pastures of California.  The show started out as a three part mini-series and then evolved into a weekly format with several cast changes.  The mini-series followed them to Wyoming and the weekly followed them to California.  Based on the novel by Evan Hunter (Strangers When We Meet, The Blackboard Jungle, Buddwing) who was better known as Ed McBain and his 87th Precinct novels and movies).  Well done frontier stories with serious storylines, romance and dogged determination so this is not a Waltons, Little House On The Prairie ot Bonanza.  This is a little darker and not quite as family friendly as you may expect.  It might appear slow at times, but remember how long the trek would have taken traveling about 12 miles a day in good weather.  Interesting and entertaining tale, worth a watch for those interested.",1422057600,,1006,4.9171597633136095

343441,5,6301677994,"12.4+ hours, 13 episodes of The Chisholms beginning with the original miniseries. One calamity after another, one romance leads to the next, greed drives men, births bring joy and trouble, there's peril, heartache, yet the Western Hope. A fictional account of normal likelihood while on the trek of seeking a new life in the Pacific region. Many tried and did; others died for their dream.
The picture quality seems better than the remembered 1979-80 TV showings, but then our TV is much better also. Fun historical American content, great nostalgic TV, many stars no longer working or living. Not as realistic by today's high standards, but a fun look back, well worth my investment.
Main cast: Robert Preston, Ben Murphy, James Van Patten, Rosemary Harris, Delta Burke, Brian Kerwin, & Stacey Nelkin all play a Chisholm, but not all survive the series. Donald Moffat, Leslie Nielsen and Mitchell Ryan appear in several episodes of discs 2-3.

NO SDH SUBTITLES or CC (closed captioning). Unrated but certainly a family viewable content.

343490,4,6301677994,"As a fan of Robert Preston, I waited many years for this to be available on DVD. It was worth the wait. The original 1979 miniseries is on Disc 1, with the short-lived 1980 TV series on Discs 2-3. I totally lost myself in the nicely paced and often deeply moving miniseries, but haven't explored much of the nine-episode series, given its numerous cast changes. (Also, one episode, ""The Promised Land,"" is an inferior printway below industry standard, out-of-focus and nothing approaching the quality of the other episodes.) Fortunately, the four-part miniseries is intact and in good shape, and it's worth the price of the DVD set by itself. Overall, an excellent Western with admittedly mediocre production values, but well-written (by Evan Hunter aka Ed McBain) and loaded with terrific acting and characterizations; Preston, Rosemary Harris, Ben Murphy and Stacy Nelkin are all outstanding. Try to overlook the many instances of bad wigs and third-rate facial hairBrian Keith's sideburns are particularly unsightlyand you're sure to have a good time with this. Meanwhile, Timeless Media Group needs to upgrade this set by finding a good-quality print of ""The Promised Land"" episode.",1411430400,19,1186,5.247368421052632

343668,5,6301677994,"I pre-ordered the dvd set , it arrived very promptly as things usually do from Amazon so thank you for that . I am an ardent fan of Ben Murphy and have eagerly awaited the release of The Chisholms because I don't remember it being shown in U.K  . I purchased a multi region player in order to watch this and the Alias Smith and Jones set , the player is great as are the series and I have thoroughly enjoyed watching them .",1405209600,,423,4.035714285714286
343669,3,6301677994,"The cover states Created by David Dotort, The Chisholms is an entertaining mix of classic t.v. western and family based drama in the vein of Bonanza, on which Dotort was a producer. Not Really, there is no resemblance at all to Bonanza. The first part of the saga is the most interesting, the scenery is fantastic, there is a tense conflict with the Comanche who want to trade for grain with the Chisholms because their tribe is starving, there is the stubborness of Hadley, the father when his son wants to marry a Comanche, and his daughters are pleasing to the eye. But the series as a whole doesn't seem to have that much action or variety in storytelling, although the chief writer, Evan Hunter is probably best known for his classic Blackboard Jungle.

In 4 of the episodes, someone is sick and dying from either a snakebite, an arrow or some disease and are bedridden in a cabin, a chuckwagon or an Indian tent struggling for survival, So why use the same type of story 4 times in a 13 episode series. And Robert Preston , previously known for the movie The Music Man seems an unlikely hero, he does a lot of preaching but doesn't show a lot of passion, nothing similar to Lorne Greene as Ben Cartwright. And Rosemary Harris, known as a stage and screen actress is more like a nanny than a pioneer heroine. Ben Murphy was previously in Alias Smith and Jones. And then the rest of the regulars James Van Patten, Susan Swift, Brett Cullen, Delta Burke, Victoria Raccino, Reid Smith, Mitchell Ryan - who are these people ?, never heard of any of them, we see their names in the opening credits but we don't know who is who, their roles are not listed anywhere..

So this is a lot more like a soap opera than a horse opera. I would have liked to seen more evil antagonists and adventure, seeing a wheel break down on a chuckwagon and then having to use a family heirloom rocking chair to fix it is not my idea of exciterment. Though when the wagon later got loose and rolled over the cliff, that was more exciting, would have liked to have seen more of that type of action. And there were a lot of sad moments, people dying and grieving, it just wasn't that much fun,

Maybe a mormon family would enjoy this type of saga, but I would rather have an hour of The Cartwrights than 12 + hours of The Chisholms anytime..",1404864000,4,2318,4.398601398601398
343670,4,6301677994,"I have been waiting for a few years for this to come out on DVD.  I have a VHS tape of the 1st episode so I was eagerly waiting for the rest of the episodes.  The picture quality is very good and I had no trouble with the disks.  How the story evolved was not exactly what I was expecting, but I enjoyed it just the same.  I have always loved Robert Preston and frankly, he was the reason I got this series.  I was disappointed in some aspects of the show but I can see myself watching it again.",1404691200,3,495,3.91
343671,4,6301677994,"Well, it was kind of an odd mini series. First 4 episodes or so pretty good. I was enjoying it. Then there was several strange moves in casting and character development. They wrote a character out, but brought back the actress mysteriously to play a similar role. Then confusingly several actors and actresses were replaced. Finally they killed off the main character. Almost had the feel like they planned on ending it after episode 5 and decided to go on. Anyway the story did give the viewer an appreciation for the bravery of the American settler. Was worth the price for the first half of their journey. They should have stayed in Missouri, or Kansas or wherever it was after episode 5.",1404432000,20,692,4.680327868852459
343672,5,6301677994,This is my FAVORITE ever.  I have waited 30 years to get a good copy of this.  I originally recorded it on a VHS tape and I have about worn that one out.

343673,2,6301677994,"This series is touted as being a family drama, and I was expecting something along the lines of the Waltons.  Hardly. I scarcely made it through a half hour of the first episode. Beside being poorly written, and superficially acted, the main subject matter is sex.  Oh, they draw the line before it gets into another rating.  It is by no means suitable for family viewing.",1403827200,13,372,4.606060606060606
343674,4,6301677994,"There is something suspect about this release. I've ordered it and it's not yet been shipped even though it's past the release date. I wonder, therefore, if this is a on-demand DVD release, as in they produce as they're ordered? Which makes me wonder what the quality will be like?

It's a good series, as i remember it. Will update when I receive it.

5/7/2014 update
I have now received my copy and had a quick look. The picture quality, while not outstanding, is very good and it all looks well. I haven't got the time to watch it right now, but suffice to say my initial fears have not been realised. It's definitely something to look forward to as I remember the first mini-series as being very good.",1402704000,14,705,4.457364341085271
