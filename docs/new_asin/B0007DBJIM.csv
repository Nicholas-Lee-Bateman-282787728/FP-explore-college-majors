8047082,3,B0007DBJIM,"Let's be honest. The scripting needs serious work, and the acting falls flat on a lot of levels. It's like when they take random people off the street and say ""here, read these lines into the camera for our commercial."" Except it's for a movie. It's almost like they're just reading their lines, the way they're said. Not that the script helps any. While the concept is nice, the production needed to be combed over a few more times.
Still, it's a fun generic movie, that you can't really get mad at, like a lot of the other films out there. It's the sort of movie that makes you go ""eh, that wasn't too bad."" The picnic scene killed me, though. The completely forget the cokes, and the guy makes a movie like ""oh crap, the cokes,"" but then just says ""forget it"" and keeps running. Those were two perfectly good drinks! 3 stars for not too bad, not to good.",1513468800,,857,4.329192546583851

8047085,1,B0007DBJIM,"This movie is flat-out putrid. The actors are very mediocre, and they speak like they're falling asleep. The plot is laughable, just like anything else in this movie. Geez, someone tell these kids to wake up. Chuck Norris can beat up 36 bad guys in the time it takes these kids to mumble ""Let's go this way....""",1150502400,4,311,4.473684210526316
8047086,5,B0007DBJIM,"There's only one word for the type of acting in this movie. Talented. Honestly, I haven't seen child actors display such raw talent in years. It isn't the script so much as the acting. It just grips me and makes me sit on the edge of my seat, because you know that these people are going to make it big when they try for bigger stuff.",1141171200,6,334,4.075757575757576
