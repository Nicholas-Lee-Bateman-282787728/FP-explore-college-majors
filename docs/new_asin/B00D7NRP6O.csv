8590416,5,B00D7NRP6O,Love the collection.  It's great for the kid in me as well as for my children and grandchildren!  Laughs galore!!  When cartoons were cartoons!!,1516320000,,144,4.916666666666667
8590417,5,B00D7NRP6O,Awesome movie!,1471392000,,14,6.5
8590418,3,B00D7NRP6O,Mixed bag of cartoons. Mostly very short run times. Video and audo quality good.,1439769600,2,80,4.785714285714286
8590419,3,B00D7NRP6O,"Good value but lack of continuity, and no where does it state this is a complete set by any means, makes this purely a sampler for those who never saw them or missed some or for very casual viewing.",1433894400,2,198,4.102564102564102
8590420,1,B00D7NRP6O,I was going to buy and then I saw what cartoons are on it and I decided that I'm not going to because it has too many cartoons from the 1990's and later. There are no DC hero cartoons from the 60's on it and too few from the 70's and 80's. I think this should have been a 50 cartoon collection with DC hero cartoons from all decades.,1386374400,4,333,3.8405797101449277
8590421,4,B00D7NRP6O,"for a show that purports to be the BEST of the warner brothers/dc comics cartoons.....not so much

the pros:

includes an episode of batman beyond, krypto (the superdog!), and legion of superheroes (pay special attention to that cleaning man behind clark when he enters the superman museum!!).

although it doesn't include any pre-1980's cartoons other than the original max fleisher superman cartoon, is surprisingly even-handed in its collecting of episodes from the various dc shows that came after dc's '90s animated resurgence and isn't just another batman-centric release.

the (very) cons:

all superfriends episodes are from the ""legendary super powers"" and ""galactic guardians"" series-granted they feature darkseid, firestorm and cyborg (and therefore feature characters those who enjoy the new 52 continuity will recognize) ANY compilation not featuring at least ONE ""challenge of the super-friends"" (banded together from remote galaxies are 13 of the most sinister villains of all time-the legion of doom!) episode cannot in all conscience be considered a best of anything.

(it would be like marvel doing a best of animated series and not including a '60s spider-man!)

the superman selections-kudos to including an ep spotlighting bizarro but ""heavy metal?""  why not ""superman's pal,"" ""knight time,"" or, just for funsies, ""girl's night out""?

the justice league selections-it was a given that ""for the man who has everything"" and the cadmus run of episodes would be heavily included (and rightly so), but ""chaos at the earth's core?""  why not ""initiation"" (the unlimited teams gathers), ""this little piggy"" (wonder woman, batman, zatanna, b'wana beast AND a pig? c'mon!), ""the great brain robbery"" (""aren't you going to wash your hands?""  ""no, because i'm EVIL""), or ""to another shore"" (featuring the fantastic visual tribute to joe kubert's viking prince)?

who knows-maybe eventually dc will decide to put together a best of release and give the fans a chance to select which ep's get included and, even though it may not include all the episodes listed above, at least we can be sure at least ONE episode of challenge of the superfriends will be!",1378425600,8,2162,5.30791788856305
8590422,5,B00D7NRP6O,"Now, let me make this clear. I DO NOT own this DVD. Amazon can throw my review off this page if they REALLY WANT TOO. I just hope they don't.
True, all of Bruce Timm's works on here I have seen. And every selection in this pack is great. You kinda wonder why there's only one ""Green Lantern"" on here, and why there are only TWO ""Batman: The Animated Series"" episodes on here, but I digress.

Anyways, the reason i'm typing these sentences at 9:30 at night, is because Amazon just threw the disc on here. Sure they added ""Add to Cart"" and the cover on here, but no episode list? Really? And since no other review has added anything yet, I'm here to list all 25 DC episodes in this collection. BTW, I will also be giving one-to-five star ratings on the Bruce Timm episodes, and throwing a few comments down at the bottom of the review. Here we go:

Classic Superman shorts:
 - ""Superman (AKA The Mad Scientist)""

Super Friends:
 - ""The Bride of Darkseid (P1)""
 - ""The Bride of Darkseid (P2)""
 - ""The Death of Superman""
 - ""The Seeds of Death""

Batman: The Animated Series:
 - ""Mad Love"" (*****)
 - ""Legends of the Dark Knight"" (*****)

Superman: The Animated Series:
 - ""Heavy Metal"" (****)
 - ""Little Big Head Man"" (***)

Batman Beyond:
 - ""Out of the Past"" (*****)

Justice League Unlimited:
 - ""For the Man Who Has Everything"" (****)
 - ""The Doomsday Sanction"" (****)
 - ""Chaos at the Earth's Core"" (***)
 - ""Destroyer"" (****)
 - ""Epilouge"" (***** + *)

Teen Titans:
 - ""Go!""
 - ""Terra""

Krypto the Superdog:
 - ""The Streaky Story""

Legion of Super-Heroes:

Young Justice (****):
 - ""Independance Day""
 - ""Misplaced""

Green Lantern: The Animated Series:
 - ""Reboot"" (****)

Comments:
 - Now, I know I complained about the severe LACK of BTAS episodes on this collection, the two on here are, addmittedly spectacular episodes and perfect for a new fan to springboard into Gotham.
 - Heavy Metal has Steel, for those who're looking for a character who's quite underused. Now, I hear he had a theatrical film, BUT, I also hear that it's terrible. Watch this instead.
 - ""Epilouge"" is I know, technically an episode of Justice League. But it is very much a BATMAN BEYOND episode. It, as you can see, also earned six stars out of five. It is GREAT. One of the best television episodes ever. Not DC TV. TV.
 - I have seen all of those Batman: TBATB episodes, just, not recently, so I don't have a current comment on them.
 - You may have noticed I haven't rated any of the YJ episodes, yet I have put a star rating on the name of the show. This is because Young Justice has an extremely balanced track record, and the entire first season is full of four-starred episodes.

Ok, thanks for reading this review, and I hope it helped!

Reccomended: For a DC Comics fan.
Highly Reccomended: For a DC Comics fan who dosen't own most of these DVDs.
Not Reccomended: For those looking for a lot of classic Batman, and not expecting more of the disc taken up by Super Friends.

See you!",1377561600,76,3114,4.478571428571429
