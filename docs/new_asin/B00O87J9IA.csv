8682492,5,B00O87J9IA,"Well, actually this is 'Live In Dublin', which I love and to which I give all stars possible.
The problem is: there is no 'Live In Berlin'!
So if you already have 'Live In Dublin', you also already have 'Live In Berlin'.",1504742400,,220,4.261904761904762
8682493,5,B00O87J9IA,"What a wonderful concert film!
I did not know many of Cohen's songs previously but I was thoroughly engaged  Such a classy musical presentation by instrumentalist and singers.
How did Leonard have the stamina to do a 3 1/2 hour concert at 80 years old?
This was like chamber music with all the mainly acoustic string instruments being given a chance to solo.
Not a flamboyant performance but full of musical value and heart.",1498867200,,424,4.72972972972973

8682497,1,B00O87J9IA,"This is an amazing concert, but Amazon's version doesn't allow you to either see a menu of songs or skip from one song to the other, instead you have to watch the whole video.  I only discovered this after purchasing the video and now it's too late for a refund.  Apple's version lets you skip to to specific songs.",1482019200,3,315,4.322033898305085

8682499,5,B00O87J9IA,"I really enjoyed this, more than Live in London. I missed LC's wind instrument guy, I think his name is Dino Soldo, in this concert. There was no sax, harmonica, or Turkish pipe.
Having said that, though, Leonard Cohen gives 100% of himself for over 3 hours.
A must see for any Leonard Cohen fan. He certainly is my hero.",1442275200,,321,4.366666666666666
8682500,5,B00O87J9IA,"This concert is fantastic. The music and the artists are excellent also. Leonard Cohen has written so many great songs in his long career and to have these songs sung once again and filmed in HD makes it a definite must have, for his fans.",1417651200,,239,4.333333333333333
8682501,5,B00O87J9IA,"Thus Cohen thanked on  09/11/2013 after the start title ""Dance me to the end of love"" the audience of the first one of both concerts. This CD and DVD set is the recording of the subsequent evening. The Master seems to love a stay in Ireland, because this was his already fifth visit in six years and a lot of fans still have tears (of joy) in the eyes while reminding of the legendary concerts in the Royal Hospital in Kilmainham, IRL. And although the O2 arena really is no small smoky jazz club, Cohen could produce such an atmosphere for his guests.

I don't know when well meet again, but tonight well give you everything weve got. He has really kept to this promise  during both evenings. And the musicians followed him and he also offered them several opportunities to fancy themselves individually musically. His voice has changed of course since 1967 when I heard him for the first time; small accompanying group and he sat on a bar stool with the guitar  no choir what still stressed the intensity of his lyrics which I had come to appreciate with the novel ""Beautiful losers"". Nowadays it could be less choir in my opinion, but this is quite personal.

Next morning, 09/12/2913,  I read the criticism in ""Irish Times""at the hotel, which summed it up like that: ""His voice is pure liquid gold - with a dash of bourbon and just a dollop of guilt and self-loathing. "" This also expressed my feelings of the eve perfectly and I have only very seldom seen so many (in particular) 55 + after both concerts who held their drinks with clearly reddened eyes . With his interpretations Cohen hadnt touched only their hearts, but also mine  no chance to fall asleep before midday and in the evening the feeling of the day before appeared immediately again, just like only having left the audience for a few moments.

Though the picture recording brings somewhat of the atmosphere, nevertheless, cant transfer the perceptible magic of the concert emotionally. Nevertheless, it is of course an absolute must for every fan. Two weeks ago I got the blu-ray set (according to Rolling Stone the up to now only concert which was taped in HD) for a few days and it is simply wonderful. Even if one has not seen it himself, the CDs already lead (listened to with closed eyes) right into the atmosphere which included everybody from 20+ up to generation 70+  you put a spell on us. The sound quality is very good for a live recording and blu-ray does not take second place to it and brings crisp colours and the picture direction operates smoothly and pleasantly.

The song list is performed; it is a mixture of his complete works till the present. CD 1 & 2 contain the concert, CD 3 three additions (3+3+2); all together Cohen spent more than 3,5-hour time for his fans  at the age of just 79 years and during two evenings! Much younger artists / bands should also follow clearly this example. Bonus-tracks on DVD (Show me the place, Anyhow, Different sides) are from three appearances in April, 2013 in Canada.

An absolute purchase recommendation for every fan; but take time to dive into this incomparable atmosphere and allow your thoughts to float.",1417392000,,3143,4.633093525179856
