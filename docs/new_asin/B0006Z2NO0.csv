Eventhough the shipping quality was so poor it even was a bit broken when I opened it, the DVD is worth it.  I would suggest sellers to be more carefull with the shipping products they use.  Just bought a few before and the shipping quality was way better.  I also have to say that the returns/refund policies are great ones here.  I bought two of these same products and one (1) arrived damaged. The seller took inmediate care of the situation and helped me with a refund/exchange.  Thank you very much.  I'm happy with the order, will order it in a near future as a present for relatives and friends, and would suggest it to anyone.  Great DVD.",1357516800,,785,4.315068493150685
