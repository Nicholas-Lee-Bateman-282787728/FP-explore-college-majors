8134921,5,B000GWFF4S,"This movie/ program in addition to being very enjoyable is unique in that it is probably presents one of the most realistic views of  Paganism I have ever seen in any media program. No sensationalism, just regular people who happen to practice the Old Ways without anti Christian garbage, silly sacrifices, or that awful old cliche about the villagers who "" seem nice"" but later turn into monsters. It's not perfect, it's not an exact representation, but clearly an effort was made to do some research and present sympathetic REAL PEOPLE not comic book villains. By the way, I'm a writer with an Anthropology/ Religious Studies degree and thirty years in the Pagan community and yes, we are just regular people. We may not all place such emphasis on casting spells many do not at all, but this is fiction and needed to keep the audiences attention. In general, they did a good job avoided many old stale traps and cliches (and lies about a misunderstood people ) and still made an interesting enjoyable show.",1431907200,,1008,4.76
8134922,4,B000GWFF4S,"A fun and entertaining movie, nice to the the early origins of the Doc Martin character. While different to the tv series he still has his quirks and problems.",1325030400,,159,4.517241379310345
8134923,4,B000GWFF4S,"If you have Volume 1 and liked it, you will want to get Volume 2.  Martin Clunes and the other regular people who work with him on this and some of his other projects (Saving Grace, Doc Martin the series, etc.) do well together.  I thought this story was fun and original.",1308009600,,272,4.211538461538462
8134924,5,B000GWFF4S,"Rather than wear out my fingers writing the same thing over again, just let me say you'll find my ""review"" under DOC MARTIN volume 1. After all, we don't want this to become the department of redundancy department, do we? Quickly now. 'Nuff said.",1288742400,,246,4.613636363636363
8134925,5,B000GWFF4S,Absolutely brilliant!!  Follow on from Doc Martin VOL 1. A must for any Clunes fans and Doc Martin series followers.  Very difficult to get a copy as it is not available in the UK but worth spending hours on the internet trying to find it.,1270080000,,239,4.288888888888889
8134926,5,B000GWFF4S,"Wonderful, Wonderful Martin Clunes shows his talent again and again with this silly film about a 'Cloutie' of which one has never heard of in Australia but the likelihood of it being a Clunes Classic is guaranteed. I now have the complete series of Doc Martin and Doc Banford and this little beaut just puts icing on the cake.  If you don't get one, you are not a Clunes Fan (or Nutter) like me. I just hope I never get sick in Cornwall! Ha! Ha!",1231804800,8,445,4.235294117647059
8134927,5,B000GWFF4S,This is one of the best sit coms I have ever seen.  To bad we can't make shows of this quality in the U.S.  This is as good as one of my most liked shows: The Good Life (differnt U.S. title)  If PBS would pick this up it would be better than Waiting for God. Just a great show.  Get an international DVD player and buy many shows from the U.K. that we can not get here such as Doc Martin at amazon.co.uk (I don't work for amazon but its a great site),1155945600,26,450,3.806451612903226
8134928,5,B000GWFF4S,"We stumbled across Doc Martin on Vision TV here in Canada...what a treat! With intelligent, very funny scripts and deft acting, Doc Martin makes for a delightful hour of tv. And it is that rare thing, a program suitable for all ages and enjoyable for each.

We are already looking forward to the Christmas special and Season 3 (which was delayed for a year). Hope they keep up the good work.

Well worth a DVD purchase.",1154563200,16,419,4.5
