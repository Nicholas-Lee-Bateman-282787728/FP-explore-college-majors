2901449,5,B000TJ6PA6,"Every once in a while a film comes along that really says something that matters. Recommended from another writer's book on poverty and social change along with BLOOD DIAMOND and TSOTSI, I picked up the film. It employed purely African actors and film crews, besides the director, out of a purposeful effort. BEAT THE DRUM ended up being one of those films that matters. Enjoy.

Set in southern Africa near Jo'burg, the story follows the journeys of a young boy named Musa. His mother and cousins have all died from the curse, but when his father dies from it at the beginning of the film, he is doomed to be known as the boy from the cursed family. He leaves his small village and heads to Jo'burg to look for his uncle and buy a cow for his grandmother, a journey which leads him into danger on the streets of the big city as he scraps for money and food amid the street riffraff.

The secondary storylines follow an older truck driver who is on the road a lot, whose wife does not trust that he is faithful while away and worries he'll give her AIDS. The owner of the truck driving company has a son who he learns is dying of AIDS, but doesn't want to face the truth of the disease's lack of favoritism.

The film puts faces and stories to the disease that is ravaging the African continent. There is much fear and ignorance surrounding the disease. People don't want to talk about it. Using local spiritists, they'd rather call on their ancestors for help than listen to the local medical workers. Some of them even want to spread the disease out of spite for the persons who gave it to them. The situation is dire, yet knowledge of the situation seems scarce enough in America. Not only does BEAT THE DRUM give a necessary voice to the voiceless Africans, it puts forward fantastic acting jobs and cinematography. The film is beautiful and sad, and while watching, I cried for Africa.

2901450,5,B000TJ6PA6,"This is compelling, heart breaking and heart warming story that both saddens and inspires.  The scenery is breathtaking, the acting is superb, and the message is one that needs to be heard by everyone.

""Prayer of Jabez"" author Dr. Bruce Wilkinson worked to produce this movie on AIDS at the request of the President of Kenya (President Moi),Is is the most award-winning motion picture on AIDS: (28 awards), and is now in distribution in over 100 nations",1212796800,32,454,4.883116883116883
2901451,5,B000TJ6PA6,"This film is so well done.  It captures all the different aspects the face many Africans dealing with the AIDS virus...from the lack of education and knowledge in the village to the issues of prostitution and poverty in the cities.  We used it as the foundation for a curriculum on HIV/AIDS education in Zambia, Africa and with every question or situation from the students we were always able to reference back to the movie. It is educational, entertaining and will definately move your spirit.",1200182400,32,495,4.880952380952381
2901452,5,B000TJ6PA6,"Excellent, excellent, excellent movie. Whoever wrote this is a master. What a great story. There should be more movies like this.",1199232000,32,129,5.190476190476191

2901454,5,B000TJ6PA6,"I saw this movie a year ago when I visited Johannesburg, South Africa around the time of World AIDS Day. To be there after watching this movie helped me understand the complexity of AIDS in Southern Africa. I attended a presentation by AIDS research experts where they tried to illlustrate that complexity to a group of Americans.  This movie artfully and powerfully communicated the message that the research statistics could not.  We left the research presentation with a lot of facts and figures....we left this movie in tears.  Not only is it a great movie for its artistry, but it is an accurate depiction of the struggle against HIV/AIDS on the ground level.  I will use this movie when I teach my students about AIDS around the world.  This is a must see movie for anyone wanting to truly understand the AIDS issue in Africa.",1196985600,36,832,4.710344827586207
2901455,5,B000TJ6PA6,"I have seen this film several times while flying overseas.  I'm anxiously awaiting it's release in the States to purchase several copies.  Having lost a son to AIDS I know firsthand the struggles the patients and their families endure.  I'm also a missionary to several African countries and know the magnitude of the stigma and suffering.  Whether you're affected by this disease or not, this is a heart-warming story that you won't want to miss.  It's an eye opener to the facts surrounding this disease in that part of the world.",1193961600,50,532,4.802197802197802
2901456,5,B000TJ6PA6,"This heartwarming, emotion-tugging captivating South African film entertains and at the same time artistically teaches the epidemiology of HIV/AIDS.  This is a fascinating feature-length film that stirs one's thoughts, transporting one's mind to South Africa, subtly instructing the viewer all the way.  I look forward to experiencing ""Beat The Drum"" again when it becomes available in the states.",1185062400,34,397,5.827586206896552

2901481,4,B000TJ6PA6,What is meant by the title of this review is that this film portrays many of the daily evils and injustices in Africa when it is in a state of peace and yet it can be shown to young teens. This movie makes starkly apparent how mysticism holds black people down and how they desperately need to embrace science to survive. It shows how even the sense of shame can be primitive and can stop the flow of valuable information and dialogue. It shows just how simple attitudes about the most important thing in the world can be. It shows the characters as human and 3 dimensional all the same. It shows that there is no easy fix for the AIDs epidemic in Africa. Even so this movie ends with a big happy ending. The voices of the elders must be cut off in this modern age. The vagina must be protected if this nation is to ever populate other planets.,1371340800,,844,4.248447204968944
2901482,5,B000TJ6PA6,"If you love Tsotsi, you will love this movie. I first seen this movie on cinamax and afterwards I searched for the dvd. This is another of my favorite foreign movies ""Beat the Drum"" is a heartfelt movie about the AIDS epidemic through the eyes of South Africans. They don't understand the disease and think its a curse from the gods. A little boy by the name of Musa (Junior Singo) searches for the reason behind this curse which took most of his family. This movie will have you crying and wanting to fly to South Africa to help the people. A Must See Movie.",1361232000,,559,4.333333333333333
2901483,5,B000TJ6PA6,"What a movie.  The acting was tremendous for every single person.  This is a feel good movie, but not an escapist one.  You see real life in Africa and real tragedy.  Very moving to say the very, very least.",1288051200,,207,4.230769230769231
2901484,2,B000TJ6PA6,"It had it's interesting points, for example how the Africans were viewing
the AIDS epedimic.  The acting and story line was more like a documentary.",1268352000,,148,4.92
2901485,5,B000TJ6PA6,this film was an excellent production of life in South Africa and dealing with Aids and how it affects the many families envolved.  This film should be included in secondary school study as it is very informative and is about actual events.,1265932800,,240,4.714285714285714
2901486,5,B000TJ6PA6,Thhis was used by Dream for Africa to motivate many youth groups to venture to Africa to educate the youth there about AIDS.,1231459200,,124,4.434782608695652
2901487,5,B000TJ6PA6,"Having been to Africa recently, I would have to say that this movie displays a very accurate representation of the country of Kenya. The concepts and hardships that the characters deal with are very real, and the contrasts between tribal communities and Kenyan cities are accurate. This movie shows the truth, and I recommend it to anyone and everyone!",1216512000,10,352,4.983050847457627
2901488,5,B000TJ6PA6,"The movie definitely merits 5 stars for its excellence and for its heart warming and heartbreaking story. It involves Africa's struggle to deal with AIDS and its devastating effects exemplified in this movie by a young boy orphaned by that disease. His search to find the knowledge of how to deal with this terrible dilemma affecting his impoverished village leads him to set out for the big city,the latter filled with danger especially for a homelss young child. This movie is emotionally-packed and well done.
I highly recommend this movie to anyone young or old.",1214006400,31,566,4.968421052631579
2901489,5,B000TJ6PA6,"Junior Singo does an absolutely excellent job portraying 10-year-old Musa, a Zulu boy who's lost his parents to AIDS, and takes up the his remaining family's burdens by leaving a dying village to find both work and an uncle in Johannesburg, South Africa.

Produced in 2002, BEAT The DRUM has earned dozens of awards and praise reviews for its uplifting message of hope and determination against the twin evils of poverty and ignorance which enable the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic that's so far killed 30 million Africans, and left over 15 million children orphaned and on the street.

Despite some scenes and situations which will undoubtedly disturb sensitive and comfortable audiences (such as the villagers' resort to animal sacrifice and the raping of children in their desperation to ""cure"" themselves of what they believe to be a curse), BEAT The DRUM provides a handsome face and a strong spirit as a symbol of Africa's present struggles.  It is a film I much recommend.",1213747200,41,981,4.969512195121951

The subject matter of aids comes up but it is within the broader context of family values, relationships and national consciousness. It's a keeper for my library.",1478563200,,317,5.115384615384615
8209587,4,B000TJ6PA6,"Mixed feelings. The child is simply beautiful and the lonely struggle of AIDS orphans is heartbreaking. But it was a little too glossy, a little too perfectly tied up, (SPOILER ALERT) And while I appreciate the effort to show AIDS crossing the color line and finally opening the eyes of a wealthy white man, it sort of felt like a ""white guy saves the day"" situation.",1477526400,,367,4.575757575757576
