919105,5,6304718764,"Originally released as an IMAX film in the mid-80s, Chronos on DVD unfortunately can not match the power of the IMAX experience. But really; what TV can compete with a 5-story-high screen? I saw the film three times  in IMAX and each time I saw something new and amazing. I couldn't wait to  get this film on DVD. Any shortcomings the Chronos DVD has are related to  the size and clarity of the image as displayed on a television, not the  film's content. The images of earthly constructions both natural and  man-made are drop-dead-gorgeous, and the music -- a nonstop electronic  instrumental score -- is mesmerizing. At roughly 45 minutes in length,  you'll not want it to end. The disc has a spare and clunky interface and no  special features, but who cares? Chronos is a wonder that I find myself  watching again and again.",914630400,72,829,4.662068965517242

Whilst the Blu-Ray lacks the digital mastering punch of its siblings Baraka and Samsara, this is a must-have for afficionados of Mr Fricke's talents.",1393891200,,248,5.72972972972973
919374,3,6304718764,"How you'll feel about this wordless documentary will largely depend on your expectations.

If you're already a fan of Baraka and Samsara, the two later successor films by Ron Fricke, and you are interested in Chronos for more of the same stunning visuals and high quality time-lapse imagery, and/or for the emotional evocation and depth of those two pictures, you'll be largely disappointed.

Chronos is a much earlier work (1985) made with more primitive technology and with less finely tuned methods. It was the first of it's kind. While there's still plenty of eye candy, I was pretty shocked by the graininess and fuzziness of many of the scenes. There's a lack of clarity to most of the shots. The colors are great in some impressive scenes (like New York City at night) but a bit underwhelming in other scenes, (the reds of the Grand Canyon really didn't pop even though the landscape itself was literally awesome). Worse, you'll find a lot of flickering in the time lapse shots. A lot. I found it seriously distracting. I reasonably surmise that the near-perfect time-lapse camera techniques in Baraka and Samsara had yet to be perfected. There are also problems with contrast--which in some scenes shifts dramatically, exacerbating the flickering. This combined with the ultrafast time-lapse motion in the subway and escalator scenes was enough to make me motion sick.

I also noticed a lot of what I thought was judder, but that didn't seem to make sense to me since this was probably shot in video at high frame rates with no 3:2 pull-down (although with time-lapsed panning shots, that might be completely irrelevant). I'm not well versed enough in the technical aspects to confidently diagnose what I saw, but I can only describe it as judder. Very noticeable, though. Turning on my TV's motion-smoother (frame interpolation for anti-judder) feature didn't help any, so something interesting is going on with the source material there.

The sounds and the score, like the video, are not at all on par with the intense, engaging, and visceral atmospheric and creative sounds used in two later films. We shouldn't expect them to be as, again, this is a much earlier peice of work, but it should be noted since this detracts from the overall experience of Chronos quite a bit.

All these factors add up to a film that can't stand up to even a casual comparison with its two siblings. At only 45 minutes, and a much more limited scope and vision, Chronos doesn't serve to draw you into the experience of the film as much as the other two films and seems to have much less to say. I say seems because all three of these films have no words, so the narrative is very much open to one's interpretation of the image sequences and sounds as they are presented, to form an experience that I've found can be quite different for different viewers and even different views by the same viewer (like experiencing any true work of art). It's not that Chronos is bad. These are, all three, subdued, open-ended, and contemplative. Here Chronos does have merit. It, too, is in its own way breathtaking and stunning, but it's held back by two major impediments: 1) Being hugely overshadowed and outdone by the other two films, 2) having technical flaws that were solved.

If you have seen Baraka and Samsara, then you can view Chronos in one of two ways in order to appreciate it.

First, is as a precursor. You can look at it in terms of the first step in a body of work by Ron Fricke that lead to monumental technical and artistic achievements in his later works. This makes Chronos very interesting to watch. Even its flaws are now interesting. If you've never seen the other two films, Chronos is a good place to start as an appetizer, but in some ways its even more dramatic to go backwards and watch Chronos last after the others. If you loved the other two films and you're now curious where they came from or how Fricke evolved his technique, his vision, and his thematic elements, you'll get a lot out of Chronos. Chronos really adds to the trilogy in this way. Baraka and Samsara don't just appear out of thin air!

The second way you can approach Chronos, is to view it on its own terms as another similarly-themed statement by Ron Fricke that is equally deserving of consideration and thought, without being compared to its outstanding brethren. While it's heavily related to the other two films, there's certainly enough individuality to warrant watching it unencumbered by expectations and prejudices that you might carry from having seen the others. But I'll admit that there's also much that's redundant--like Fricke's favorite tactic of juxtaposing desolate natural scenes or scenes of ancient ruins with modernity in all of its hustle and bustle. Again, it's hard not to draw comparisons which will either leave you thinking ""I've seen this before"" or ""eh, that was OK, but it's not like that one scene from Baraka/Samara with the ____"". When you start comparing this to the other two films, it's an unfair comparison and Chronos can't even begin to compete. Remember: 1985 and a much, much, much lower budget.

I'm not sure whether the quality issues here are with Chronos itself or just the Bluray transfer, but they surely do hurt the film and take away from what would otherwise be worthy on its own. Unfortunately, it's hard to overlook them. It's also hard to overlook the fact that for the vast majority of folks out there, Baraka and Samsara are going to blow them away in a way that will ruin Chronos for them if they've seen it and will make them feel they wasted their time with Chronos if they choose to see it first. But, for those really intrigued by Fricke's more recent work, Chronos shows the evolution of techniques, styles, and thoughts that won't find their truest expression until decades later. It's also compelling enough on its own if you can not be distracted by the technical flaws of trying to produce a film that was the first of its kind with the technology of 1985, and if you aren't watching Chronos expecting it to live up to expectations from Samsara or Baraka.

In Short: it's worth seeing, just don't expect to be blown away (expect imperfection and flaws) and surely do not use this as reference material to test or show off the capabilities of your  Home Theater system!",1388361600,3,6317,4.738853503184713

919465,5,6304718764,"I will give a summary of Chronos. It begins with Stonehenge in Southern England, then goes to the Pyramids in Egypt, followed by the Acropolis in Athens, Greece. Next is the Grand Canyon, followed with what appears to be Monument Valley in Utah. Then we see the traffic in New York City at a frantic pace. Fricke uses time lapse photography, slowing down the sun's rays or speeding up cloud formations. He  uses various lenses which distort the pictures. We return to Egypt and the pyramids and statues of Pharaohs, then the Sphinx. Next we see statues in the Athens museum and the Parthenon, with time lapse clouds, followed by a statue of the Roman Emperor Constantine in Istanbul. Next is Rome and the arena, followed by Mont San Michel on the north coast of France at high tide, followed by a wide shot of Toledo, Spain. Then we see several cathedrals and what might be the Vatican in Rome. Then on to a wide shot of the City of Light (Paris) with the Eiffel Tower. Next, La Scala opera house in Milano and Grand Central Station with crowds moving at a frantic pace in New York City.
P.S. I could have just written that the photography and music were awesome, but this was more fun. The entire program is 45 minutes long. If you catch any mistakes, let me know.

3 Star Baraka Too weird to handle.

This is the same review I'm combining for the comparison of both Chronos and Baraka.

CHRONOS & BARAKA
These programs are visual displays of majestic landmarks, people, cultures, and wonders of the world.  If you want to watch TV, but don't feel like watching TV, these are the way to go.  No thinking, no storyline, just relax and let your imagination go.  It's a revolutionary new age type of artistic display.  They can be watched repeatedly without boredom, like a music CD.

DIGITAL PICTURE QUALITY
All the negative rap I read about regarding picture quality of the CHRONOS blu ray transfer held me back from purchasing.  But recently, I took a leap of faith upgrading my old dvd copy, and whala! I was absolutely amazed at the stunning BD picture quality!  Full 1080p high def detail.  Sure, there are a few jitters and artifacts, but nothing like the bad taste others had elaborated on.  Perhaps the reviewers were spoiled with the Baraka standard, which any BD transfer will pale to.  But Chronos is definitely acceptable, and considering this IMAX is 3 decades old, this blu ray is a huge improvement and well worth the upgrade from dvd.

BARAKA
As far as the content of Baraka, the major problem I have are those bizarre African tribe ritual scenes.  Not that there's anything wrong with this, but I'd much rather see this in a documentary, with a narrator describing this cultural meaning.  Ie, teach me. OK, I see the point of Baraka is appreciation of art, but without the explanation, these weird clips leave me in a state of mysterious void of confusion. Perhaps Baraka should have a 2nd audio channel or subtitle. Same goes with the shots of the homeless and inner city trash: BORING, and disgusting.  Homeless people and trash on 1080p is not art.

ART
Chronos is Baraka minus the weird tribal rituals.  Chronos is 100% sheer art in its original Ron Flicke form.  Every scene, second, and breath has power, deep thoughts and emotions attached to it, can be watch numerously, anytime.  Chronos blu ray also includes 3 invaluable features not on Baraka.  1) Global location pop up, 2) Annotations pop up of detailed features of each location, and 3) Director's audio commentary.

I give Chronos blu ray 5 star, and Baraka blu ray 3 stars.",1271548800,6,2343,4.733333333333333

The time lapse photography is breathtaking at times, the accompanying music is well matched.  However, it has been approximately 25 years since this was made, and the visuals that were unbelievable in the 80s are far more commonplace today.  The clarity is perfectly suited for 1080p HD, as is the rich soundtrack.
Chronos provides great background visuals and music for a more formal dinner party of get together; it's not particularly fitting for ""let's go watch Chronos!""

919689,1,6304718764,"I loved (and still do) Baraka on BluRay, and thought this may be similar. While the scene choices are dramatic, it becomes quite obvious that the filming technology (or the scanning of the original film) is far below current BluRay players. It's deceiving to sell this title on BluRay as that implies superb picture quality, and I totally disappointed in what is delivered. I would return this if I could get any portion of a credit, but it sat for the holidays, and was not viewed, so too much time went by (I assume). This is a total waste of time, as the people who scanned the original film either compressed it digitally WAY TOO MUCH, or the original film is just not that great. It's only just beyond normal DVD quality. I watched it for about 10 minutes, was disgusted, and it has never been on since. Ron Fricke's Baraka is so superb on BluRay, I keep telling myself it was a 'vote' towards his films, and hope for another Baraka some day.

Chronos on BluRay is grainy, choppy and I could not stand to view it for more than 10 minutes. I have many BluRay films, and have superb results with picture quality using the same setup (BluRay player over HDMI using a 46"" Sharp 700UN series LCD-LED HDTV on 1080P).

If you are expecting crystal clear images, you will be disappointed, I certainly was.

If you do not own Baraka, STOP and buy that INSTEAD of Chronos! That film, on BluRay, can be found for a similar price and its image quality (on BluRay) is superb (plus the film is superb on ANY medium. Saw it for the first time on VHS and loved it!). I found 'Chronos' to be boring, as it did not 'suck me in' Like Baraka does (even after seeing it many many many times).

The idea is the same on both movies, and it may just be that Chronos being 6 years before Baraka just did not have the technological 'umph'? I bought Chronos BASED on Baraka and the fact that Ron Fricke did them both. I wish I had read the negative reviews on Amazon, but looked (lazily) at the overall star rating and because I am so impressed with Ron Fricke's Baraka. Luckily I only paid about $10 for Chronos, so not a huge deal. I would sell it at a yardsale for $1...

But in taking the time to write this review, I want to be accurate about what buyers will see, and give proper expectations to people considering purchasing Chronos.",1264809600,26,2318,4.356481481481482

The visual images captured in time (using time-lapse photography), combined with 6 channel sorround sound, is just stunning to watch and absorb.  I have been to several of the places pictured in this HD-DVD.  But this video with its varied vantage points and lighting setups, paints a picture that is superior to my recollection of those actual places.  This was particularly true in the case of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.  My goodness, what a stunning time lapse video that turned out to be.  Also, the movement of people at Grand Central Station in New York (in heart thumbing fast motion) was yet another delight.  I am extremely happy with my purchase.",1264032000,,702,4.8
919691,1,6304718764,"Playing my Chronos Blu-Ray I was literally shocked at the incredibly poor image quality that was possible in a transfer to Blu-Ray. As one reviewer stated - even some standard-def DVDs look better. The image resolution is not what I expected from a HD format.  Excessive grain permeates even the brightly lit scenes. The constant brightness shifting or flickering was simply annoying and was present throughout the entire presentation. The shaky image in the first Grand Canyon scene looked amateurish. I thought Chronos in Blu-Ray would be an impressive feature to show off the capabilities of HD , unfortunately I would be embarrassed to show this to anyone.

The subject matter of Chronos was impressive in some locations but the harmonious blend from scene to scene that was displayed in Baraka was not present , simply a conglomeration of shots that seemed to be added together with no real theme. The dated music (even by 1980s standards) by  Michael Stearns makes watching this poor quality Blu-Ray that much more unbearable.

If you want to see another film by this legendary director, get the Blu-ray of Baraka...the transfer to Blu-ray is the best out there....BY FAR!! I highly recommend it.

919693,3,6304718764,"I have already own a DVD of this movie years ago.  I purchased the blu-ray version hoping to get better pictures of the same movie.  So this review is NOT about the movie.  You already know I liked the movie, otherwise I won't buy another copy.  This review is about the Blu-ray disc quality.  I am kinda disappointed.

I have also purchased the Baraka blu-ray disc by the same director.  That was stunning and I gave it 5 stars.  I only give 3 stars to this one.

There are many artifacts in this Blu-ray disc.

1. grain patterns.  You can easily see a grainy pattern on top of most pure color part of the images, e.g. the sky.  The pattern is quite consistent everywhere as if it comes from the scanning equipment.
2. jittering.  In some scenes, you can see the image shakes left and right as if the frames of film were not aligned correctly during scanning.
3. Wrong aspect ratio.  The original movie was filmed in IMAX, i.e. it was not in 16x9 ratio, it was shot in a almost square format.  Much of the top and bottom of the original cinematography were eliminated when framed into a 16x9 format.  It would be nice if they include both the cropped version and the original square version on the disc.  Blu-ray has the capacity to handle two versions of a 45 minutes movie.

At Amazon.com this disc costs half that of Baraka.  However, since this film is only half the running length compare to Baraka, it is not that much of a good deal.  Baraka is a much better Blu-ray disc to own.  See my review on that disc.  Baraka was filmed in 65mm 2.21:1 widescreen format, so the original cinematography fits in the 16x9 format nicely after letterboxing.

It is a visual and audio experience nonpareil.  The music is excellent and blends very well with the film--you'll probably find you'll want the soundtrack on its own.

I recognized some of the European, Egyptian and US locations, but always wondered where some of the more obscure ones were. Well, to my surprise the HD version has an optional ""Popup"" feature to give the locale and some description behind it while the film is running. There is also a commentary soundtrack which is interesting as well.

There are so many great scenes, but one of my favorites is panning across Paris with the Eiffel Tower in the distance and Gargoyle from Notre Dame in the foreground.

I own both the Blu-Ray and HD versions and after A/B-ing them have observed no discernible difference in the video (MPEG2) nor in the audio (the Blu-Ray is DTS HD Master, whereas the HD DVD is DTS-HD High Resolution Audio).

First of all Chronos cannot really be compared to Baraka in anyway, as it's earlier and more experimental in its nature, alot of people come to see it and expect to see Baraka 2.0, it's not, its really for the fans of Ron Fricke who would want to see how he went about creating Baraka after having started sketching out the concepts in Chronos.

A much better transfer than I expected, near perfect, especially considering the age of the film. The DRS company did a fine job.
As far as the film itself, this is a ""Bolero"". Not intended for ADD viewers or fast food consumers. This is art, not product. It's Fricke's first major film (that I'm aware of). It's a beautiful exploration of the passing of time with unpresidented cinematography. Films like this are why I got my big screen hi-def TV and BD player. Other movies are fun, and look great, it's true, but Fricke's work a whole different world.",1210377600,22,988,4.4944444444444445

919889,2,6304718764,"While the quality of the images is fairly good - average high-def quality, the content is lacking.

This film is a collection of shots from the USA and Europe. Some of the shots are of beautiful scenes and historical landmarks(some of the church interiors are amazing). But this is almost just a random series of still photos. It lacks any real story, drama, or cohesion.

The editing is particulary pedestrian and can even be irritating at times. Shots are sometimes too short and they cut back and forth between two locations for no apparent reason. The shots lack pacing or any kind of real drama or meaningful sequence. For example one shot is a time lapse photo of some stalls in a market/alley in Israel where you watch blurs of people whiz by a bored young man slouching in his 5ft x 5 ft cigarette stand (seriously).

Most of the film is just the camera sitting still on a tripod getting time-lapse shot of a)people or cars moving very fast in the city b)the interior of a fancy european building, or c)landscapes where the shadows of the clouds pass over the land very fast. The only time the camera moves is some 10 second sequences where they do helicopter fly overs in the southwest U.S or on a boat in the canal in venice.

Again, SOME shots are pretty. But there is little creativity, drama or excitement here - its just an almost random sequence of shots where the camera is placed in front of some landmark and left to run for several hours in stop motion mode. Kinda like looking at a hi-res travel album.

Another minor annoyance to me is that they use a a wide angle lense that has very bad barrel distortion. When they do shots of interiors of buidlings the vertical surfaces at the edges of the picture bend in very badly at the top and bottom.

And the music is just a typical synthesizer playing elevator quality music (at times its annoying).

This film is also VERY short - about half the length of a normal film.

Overall a minor piece of film. Not worth the money unless you can get it for maybe about 1/3 of what a normal film goes for and you just want to see some hi-res travel shots.",1199318400,4,2114,4.416452442159383

Perhaps Godfrey Reggio could have assembled the footage in a meanigful way, but sadly he and Fricke had parted company.

The music by Michael Stearns fits the film perfectly, as it is shallow and with little merit.  Listening to it once gives you all that it has to offer.  Remember that old characteristic of art being inexhaustable?  By exhausting itself in a single sitting, Stearns' score finds itself at the wrong end of the spectrum.  It's un-art,non-art, negative-art, or trash.

Each scene sequence (beautiful architecture and sculptures) instead had a less noticeable time lapse that slowly elapsed over a few hours with shadows and spots where the sun hits, alluding to the well made buildings of our ancestors and their ability to stand the tests of time.

The cinematography is a heightened visual voyage: absolutely gorgeous, wondrous, expansive, at times inspiring and at other times devastating.  The integration of the soundtrack and images is seemless and potent.

Actually, what is truely stupifying is how bad most of the scenes are.  I mean really what this boils down to are a number of time lapse photographs.  So, you'd think you'd look for some inspiration in the composition and like a good photographer aim for shooting in some good light.  Well, they didn't.  There are couple really great shots, but most of it is poor filler in poor light with poor composition.  Very poor showing indeed.  It takes great discipline not to grab the remote and fast forward to one of the few gems they came up with.

As far as the DVD goes the transfer is rather poor for something that only has visual effects going for it.

As far as the music goes - wow is it bad.  I mean bad, bad.  It is as uninspired and misdirected as the film.  I'd suggest turning it off actually and just watching the images.

This is what happens when someone smitten with a cinemagraphic technique wants to show it off but lacks any further creative direction.

If you've never seen Baraka or Koyaanisqatsi then skip this film and watch one or both of those.  If you have seen either of those films then don't waste your time with this one, it reuses numerous vantage points from those films and as I said rather than being unified in any sense they are a hodgepodge of visual blather.

I thought it was really great, especially the fantastic soundtrack by Michael Stearns and Constance Demby.  This DVD is beautifully done, a better quality version of the IMAX experience.  I do agree that the layout of scenes should have been more progressive from location to location instead of jumping from one location of the world to another.  Even with this error in editing pace, the film stands as a wonderful tribute to the beauty of nature and chaotic life on Earth.  I've always loved seeing time-lapse photography in action.  It's amazing how a city at night, like Los Angeles in the film, appears as if it is a big circuit board with constant energy currents flowing through it where the freeways are located.  This  film has awakened my keen desire to get the soundtrack.  It is wonderfully atmospheric with celestial tones that bring the listener into a realm of aural pleasure.  The DVD also has an audio commentary track well worth listening too.  Michael Stearns, Alton Walpole and Ron Fricke give a lot of interesting facts on a scene-by-scene perspective of the production.  There are also some in-depth behind-the-scenes featurettes that give more info. on how the film was created as well, plus plenty of textual info on the locations, people and other movie-related things.  For me, I loved the short featurette by Michael Steans on ""The Beam"" instrument used for soundtrack.  Another excellent IMAX movie created by Ron Fricke and Michael Stearns at the same time as ""Chronos"" was ""Sacred Site"", which played as a double bill with ""Chronos"" in 1987.  I really like this movie, more so the soundtrack.  As mentioned before, the only thing that stands out as a slight negative point is the weird editing style of jumping around to different worldly locations so quickly instead of progressively moving from one place to another.

""Chronos"" was filmed on location at over sixty sites around the globe. Images of significant natural beauty, architectural complexity, iconic historical sculpture and various panoramic cityscapes were captured on 70mm film using mostly slow motion and time lapse cinematography.
The wordless narrative structure of the work primarily attempts to convey feelings of reverence and appreciation for the breath-taking subject matter. In addition, it also suggests states of significant anxiety experienced as a consequence of the pace and complexity of modern urban life.
Electronic music, composed and performed by Michael Stearns, is thoroughly integrated with the considered, slowly paced editing of Alton Walpole and Ron Fricke.  Image and sound interpenetrate one another to suggest and convey the eloquent wordless scenario, which was conceived by both Constantine and Genevieve Nicholas.
Having begun as cinematographer for director Godfrey Reggio's film ""Koyaanisqatsi"", we see with ""Chronos"" that Ron Fricke helped to sow the visual and conceptual seeds of wordless narrative film.  This medium finally bore satisfying fruit with 1992's feature length work ""Baraka"". ""Chronos"", however, remains as essential viewing.

Imagine, a Movie CD is pretty low quality. For me to like it through all that, it must be something good. So imagine what it's like on DVD. :)
edit-  Small addition  it's 4/27/02 and I own the dvd now.  Unfortunately it's now out of print. :(  The dvd is a very good transfer, but a rather poor layout design will give anyone a good headache before they get to film.  Still a must buy if you can find it.",989798400,3,746,3.8815789473684212
920149,3,6304718764,"I saw this movie probably 10 times at  the Los Angeles IMAX when it debuted. The sound, if I recall correctly, was in surround. I'm disappointed this disk was in stereo. I would be willing to pay up to 3x more for the 5.1 surround. Unapix are you listening?",979430400,5,257,4.244897959183674
920150,5,6304718764,"I watch ""Chronos"" on a fairly regular basis. Purely a concept film (no dialogue, characters, plot, etc.), the deft editing, combined with one of Michael Stearns' most powerful musical efforts, results in an almost psychedelic experience. The film is an engaging experiment in the documentation of and toying with the passage of time, both in the historical sense (progression from ""barbarism"" to civilisation) and in the chronological sense, alternately slowing down and speeding up the sequences to varying degrees. The final ""scene"" (as it were) is magnificent, bringing the acceleration of time to its logical conclusion. Purely an audio-visual experience, it is best seen on as large a screen as one can afford and with an equally powerful sound system.",978825600,6,757,5.316666666666666
920151,3,6304718764,"In a word, this film is stunning. In many ways, this film truly shows how incredible the IMAX format can be. Beautiful cinematography and a haunting and powerful score by Micheal Stearns make for a truly memorable film  experience. This film was directed shot by Ron Frick, the cinematographer  behind the legendary, Koyaanisqatsi. With a theme that more celebrates  man's achievements rather than condems them (as was the the case in  Koyaanisquatsi), Frick and Stearns take you for a real ride.
When I saw  this was on DVD, I jumped! I rushed home, threw it into my brand new DVD  player and component, Sony monitor and sat back in anticipation of being  mesmerized all over again. Unfortunately, that did not happen. Why!  Primarily because the DVD transfer is just awful. It was apparently taken  from an old video tape telecine. The print is dirty and floats in the film  gate, the video tape format was apparently composite - possibly an old  1"" video transfer (dot crawl and all) and, the compression is poor -  nasty blockies and ""mosquitoes."" Even the 16 bit, 48kHz audio is  mediochre as it seems to have come off of the same old video  master.
Considering the potential of DVD, it is a real shame such a great  film received such poor treatment. To be fair, this appears to have been a  ""first generation"" DVD release where such things as direct,  digital transfers and 24p encoding may not have been available  yet.
Hopefully, this as well as Koyaanisqatsi, Powaqatsi and Buraka will  all be released on DVD using state-of-the-art transfer and encoding  techniques. I am eagerly awaiting (probably foolishly).
Ah  well...

920152,3,6304718764,"There is nothing wrong with Chronos but Baraka covers the same ground, has some of the same images, has better picture and sound quality, and is by the same bloke.  Baraka simply gives more bang for your buck, but having  said that I own both and like them both.  On the other hand, Chronos is  good when you don't have time to sit through the whole of Baraka.",963360000,4,360,4.25

Given that there's basically no dialogue in the move, it would stand to reason that THE SOUNDTRACK IS KIND OF IMPORTANT.  Let's just  say the stereo encoding really left something to be desired.  Also, the age  of the film shows.",947376000,3,317,4.305084745762712

In all, quite an experience.  I am glad I bought the DVD instead of renting it from the public library.",1506643200,,367,4.352941176470588

In fact, I have the first release on laser disc and DVD but this new release is wonderful. No words, only images and music.
""Chronos"" means ""time"" and this film is a voyage in time around the world, from the Egyptian pyramids and mysterious places like Uluru, to modern cities like Paris showing human activities and achievements. Highly recommended for someone who loves our planet.",1495411200,4,562,4.564356435643564

There is no narration, so be sure to check out the DVD extras for the list of photo shoots. It is quite impressive.
The soundtrack is ""new age music"", a genre that still lives on in planetarium shows. You either love it or hate it.
I gave it 3 stars for the subject matter, which is awesome.",1476316800,2,531,4.257425742574258
