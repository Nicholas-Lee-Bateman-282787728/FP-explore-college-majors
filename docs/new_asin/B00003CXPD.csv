1273629,4,B00003CXPD,"Myself, being a male, knows I have been touched by a film when I walk out of the theatre wanting to become a ballet dancer! It may sound ridiculous, but it is true! Jamie Bell is destined to stardom. The acting was superb, but the story was extremely predictable. That's not necessarily a negative thing, though. I will be very happy if Mr. Bell is nominated for an Oscar, but the film will most likely be over-looked because of it's lightheartedness. The dancing is great and the music is very enjoyable. All in all, a fantastic lil' gem, especially for the holiday season!",975888000,2,574,4.58252427184466
1273630,5,B00003CXPD,"Beginning with an exuberant title sequence, this charming, offbeat, coming-of-age story revolves around Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell), the younger of two sons of a widower coal miner (Gary Lewis) near Newcastle in Northern England. It's 1984, and the National Union of Mine Workers is engaged in a long, bitter strike, marked by street battles with riot police and protests against the busloads of scabs crossing the picket lines.
Following the family tradition, Billy is expected to learn boxing at the Everington Boys Club where, instead, the 11 year-old becomes enthralled by the girls' dancing class, led by a chain-smoking teacher (Julie Walters) who soon recognizes his raw talent. He loves watching Fred Astaire in old movies and is instantly drawn towards the ballet class, but when his macho father and rabble-rousing brother (Jamie Draven) discover he's taking ballet classes, they ridicule Billy - ""Lads do boxing and football and wrestling, not friggin' ballet!"" - forcing him to hide his slippers under the mattress and sneak off to class. Then come the auditions for the Royal Ballet School and Billy's defiantly joyful, foot-stompin' ""I Want to Boogie"" sequence.
What makes this heartfelt English import such a gem is the collaboration of screenwriter Lee Hall, cinematographer Brian Tufano (""Trainspotting"") and former stage director Stephen Daldry (""An Inspector Calls""), who - despite the simplistic predictability of the plot - create eccentric, lovable characters and evocative imagery. One haunting sequences focuses on a little neighborhood girl dragging a stick along a brick wall, which dissolves into a phalanx of plastic police shields. Another involves the father grimly chopping up Billy's mother's beloved piano for needed firewood. While some of the authentic, heavily accented dialogue may be indecipherable to some, the musical soundtrack, combining classical and pop, is terrific.
In the title role, newcomer Jamie Bell embodies awkward determination, juggling grim reality with a surreal fantasy world, explaining, ""Just because I like ballet doesn't mean I'm a pouf!"" As Billy's father, Gary Lewis (""My Name is Joe"") is tough-yet-tender, and Julie Walters (""Educating Rita"") scores as Billy's crusty yet compassionate teacher. (""I feel like a sissy,"" Billy tells her. ""Well, don't act like one,"" she retorts.) Jamie Draven and Stuart Wells lend strong support. Jean Heywood is touching as Billy's senile grandmother, whom he tenderly cares for and who repeatedly recalls, ""I could have been a professional dancer.""
While the bleak setting, in the 1984 miners' strike in northeastern England, is reminiscent of ""The Full Monty,"" the energetic mood evokes ""Flashdance"" - and it was a bit hit at both the Toronto and Cannes Film Festivals. On the `Lund Movie Scale' of 1 to 10, ""Billy Elliot"" is an exhilarating 9. Combining comedy and poignancy, it's all about being able to express yourself.",975715200,110,2921,5.379912663755459
1273631,5,B00003CXPD,"Jamie Bell's performance as Billy Elliot is pure magic. As the coal miners son who wants to dance, who discovers ballet, and has to overcome the prejudices of his father and brother, both embittered and disillusioned by the violence of the coal miners strike in the UK in the early 80's, this will go down as one of the great performances, in one of the great films, on the theme of the little guy triumphing over adversity to live his dream. There were tears in my eyes almost from the opening, as we are transported on this journey of hope and courage in the face of adversity told from the perspective of a little boy. I think that The Sixth Sense proved that there is nothing like a child's perspective, a child's anguish, to grab the consciousness of an audience, and take them on a journey to deal with big issues. But whilst The Sixth Sense was great, this is MUCH BETTER!!!! It's more real. It tells the story of the extraordinary within a world and life of great simplicity... and there is the magic! You don't need stunts when life itself is so amazing, the greatest mystery. Jamie Bell will be nominated for the Oscar... whether he wins it I can't say... but this performance is a gift to us all.",974678400,5,1207,4.441441441441442
1273632,5,B00003CXPD,"ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL!! This movie is the greatest film of all time. It was just beautiful. Jamie Bell's performance was outstanding. You fall in love with this little boy as he takes you into his life. The amount of emotion involved in this film is immense and you are brought along with the characters in ways so many films fail to produce. The premise seems superficial at first glance, but as the movie carries along the substance comes pouring out. I can not say enough about the beauty in this film and the quality of it's direction. It deserves oscar nominations all around!!!!!",973036800,14,584,4.735294117647059
1273633,5,B00003CXPD,"If you love intimate, moving character films like Cinema Paradiso, you will love love love Billy Elliot.  A small, rousing British film with cleverly written characters, this movie is both sentimental and expertly crafted.  The performances, particularly from Julie Walters as the dance instructor, and that winsome, melancholy but excpetionally gifted boy as Billy, will truly steal your heart.  The simple premise is instantly grabbing -- an artistic boy, only 11, is unfortunately the most forgotten element in a fractured, sad little family, which includes a pre-Alzheimer's grandmother, an angry older brother and a defeated, sad and tense father.  While Dad and bro are on strike, money is tight - the year is 1984 at the height of British strike/tensions.  Billy is sent to boxing lessons, where, by happenstance, he discovers a true vent for his budding creativity -- and especially his joy in dancing.  Filled with infectiously appealing pop and light-classical music, this film is part Rocky, part Hollywood musical, part Flashdance and part Cinema Paradiso.  The chance that these disparate, unlikely approaches might actually add up to something compelling are unlikely, but you must experience this movie to understand how exciting, moving and intensely gratifying it can be.  Painted in bold, creative colors and shot with a springy exuberance, Billy Elliot is terrific.",972864000,61,1384,5.404651162790698
1273634,4,B00003CXPD,"A beautiful social commentary on dance, masculinity, and poverty.  There are several great moments of dance that incorporate ballet, jazz, and traditional Irish elements.  The film explores life of a young boy, struggling with soceity's mandate on being male.  The film touches on the issues of three kids: a young heterosexual female growing up in a two parent household pretending to hold it together, a young homosexual struggling to understand his feelings, and an asexual Billy Elliot coming to terms with his love of dance.  The film also touches on transcending class.  As they show the final shots of the townspeople who we get to know, you get a very strong sense of where the experience of this film leaves them.  Very powerful.  Great use of atmosphere, identical to The Full Monty (a must-see if you loved this film).  Watch this film with friends or family, and discuss it afterwards.",972777600,7,897,4.933333333333334

1273911,3,B00003CXPD,"Seemed choppy to me. I couldn't believe how Billy became part of the dance group. The initial contact yes, but after that it was very questionable. If they would have had the young girl 'pull' him into it via romance, sex, or just being chided into it, then the set up of him getting involved would not have block my continuing believability. Over all just choppy.",1500422400,,364,4.53030303030303

Have seen it many times and enjoyed it even more this time by turning on the subtitles.
Not really necessary to enjoy the film, but if you want to understand each and every word, subtitles are there to clarify the local accents.
This film is much better than the stage play and brings happy tears each time I watch the ending.
Also love how each character slowly evolves through out the film as well as encourages male dancers to succeed.
No stereotypes required. Just a heart's desire.",1495843200,,536,4.712765957446808

He fights for what he wants, finally brining his hard-working, widower father around, and the last scene... I must have watched just those final few minutes about ten times... breathtaking!

1274127,5,B00003CXPD,One of my all time favorite movies. The boy playing Billy does justice to the part. He is endearing in his passion for something that clearly is also a conflict for him.

In fact, my kids liked it so much, they watched it a second time.  It is a heart warming story, which shows how imperfect families (not always living in the best of circumstances) can pull together to support each other.  I love the message it gives, by having Billy remain true and loyal to his childhood friend, regardless of his sexual orientation.  It also shows a father come to terms with letting go of his own preconceived notion of how his son should live, to doing the right thing in supporting his son's dreams.  Great movie, and in my opinion, suitable for kids.",1449187200,,698,4.3307692307692305

We agreed that we would try to find it and watch it again soon. The musical and dancing talents of the young stars of the show, at least to me, were just amazing.

1275369,4,B00003CXPD,"'Billy Elliot', a small UK film released in 2000, has taken on a life of its' own & become a Broadway production, almost in spite of itself. But it's a heartwarming story of a miner's son determined to dance ballet.

We meet motherless Billy (Jamie Bell) during the 1984 miner's strike in County Durham. His grandmother is bordering on Alzheimer's, & it's his duty to track her down when she wanders off. Father (Gary Lewis) & brother Tony (Jamie Draven) are picketing the mines. Despite having no income, Dad finds a way to pay for Billy's boxing lessons weekly.

Billy's life changes when the workingman's club that holds his boxing class is invaded by a beginner's ballet class, taught by Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Waters). The 1st week he watches from the sidelines; the 2nd week finds him hesitantly joining in, despite his lack of any appropriate dance gear. Initially brisk, Mrs Wilkinson sees hidden depths to Billy, & soon is tutoring him privately, unknown to Billy's family, who all think he's attending boxing class.

When the truth is revealed, Mr Elliot hits the roof. Tony is unbelieving. Only Billy's best friend Michael (secretly gay, & played by Stuart Wells) is accepting of his choice.

Jamie Bell's performance as Billy is spot-on. The script, written by Lee Hall, is partly based on a real dancer. Stephen Daldry ably directs. Your heart will be warmed by the end of 'Billy Elliot'. This is a movie the whole family can enjoy!

Wonderful music is used throughout the film. There are a number of T. Rex songs, as well as a stunning sequence to 'A Town Called Malice'.",1442707200,,1584,4.766423357664234

The family, struggling with the death of a much-loved wife and the loss of work because of a violent strike in Ireland, is almost hopeless. But the kid can't get the sound of music out of his head.

This movie shows us that if we really have a burning desire to accomplish something that  we feel in our very being  is what we are meant  to do, if we are willing to defy the odds then,  we can do what ever it is that we want to do no matter the odds and  we and can succeed when we  follow our dreams and our heart. This is a very heart warming story about a boy who at 11 knew exactly what he wanted to do & a father who supported him against all odds  Just the willingness of the father to give his support to his son .  The movie is well worth watching for this alone.",1404604800,,889,3.819672131147541

The starring child actor is immensely talented, and the supporting actors are well-cast, believable characters of the small, hard-luck mining town he's growing up in.
Less than 5 stars were given because I disagree with the ending that left me wanting so much more. [However, rumor has it that the sequel, starring the SAME actor (now in his late 20's) is planned; it may finally deliver the ending I feel I was denied here.]  Only because I'm American, I watched the movie with the English subtitles ON in order to fully understand what was being said, although this is not, at all, necessary for following the movie in general ... everyone can understand this story, and be swept up in the magic of it.",1397779200,,888,4.803921568627451

Billy's macho father and older brother are both miners, but father wants to cross the picket line and his son is violently union and even gets arrest during one of the union protests, so there's that interplay. Billy is supposed to be taking boxing lessons, but he hates the violence and is not very good at it. He discovers a ballet class held in the same building at the same time and becomes fascinated with it. The ballet teacher agrees to him joining the class, finds that he has talent, and gives him private lessons for nothing. When Billy's father and brother find out about the ballet, things get pretty heated. Eventually, after the ballet teacher lays it on the line, telling Billy's father that Billy should try out for the Royal Ballet audition, father reluctantly gives in and the older son goes along with it. Father accompanies Billy to the audition and the interview, at which time he seems to realize how lucrative a dance career could be for Billy and that it would save him from having to toil in the mines. Although it was not alluded to in the movie, It was rather obvious that Billy received a scholarship to the Royal Ballet school because otherwise there is no way his family could afford to pay. However, there are two omissions that bother me a little. After Billy passes the audition, the next thing we see of him is as an adult going on stage as the lead male dancer in a ballet, with his father and brother in the audience, so is this the first time they've seen Billy dance or just the first time they saw him dance the lead? Also, where has Billy been all this time? Has he lived in London in a dorm for students of the Royal Ballet, has he commuted back and forth from London to his home? I know they're both small things and some of you reading this interview may think I'm nitpicking, but I'm the kind of person who doesn't like anything left hanging. It hasn't diminished my love for movie, however - I'd just like to know! By the way, that final scene, when Billy goes on stage, is magnificent. Every time I watch this movie I rewind to the beginning of that scene and watch it a couple of more times. It's a rather short scene, but OMG - what a magnificent dancer and perfect use of slow-mo!!!",1370649600,2,2338,4.426914153132251

1277408,5,B00003CXPD,"In a nutshell, Billy Elliot is an inspirational film about a talented boy that wants to be a professional ballerina set amidst a miners' strike during Thatcher's era in Northern England. The movie is fairly typical of inspirational films and follows the formula closely, but it feels neither over dramatized nor does it end predictably. I was so sure that the film was either a biopic (it isn't) or an adaptation (guess again) because of the multidimensional characters and writhing backdrop of players and politics. Two actors are worthy of special mention: Gary Lewis plays Billy's father, Jackie Elliot, with such an incredible range of seething emotions that he never once falls into an archetypal role or stereotype. Jackie is a lifelong miner with a narrow world view, so when he sees Billy dancing for the first time,  the expected anger is there, but it shares equal space and time in his actions and eyes with fear and guilt. Fear, perhaps, that his son may be ridiculed, that he may not have raised him right, and guilt because his deceased wife, Billy's mother, was a music lover and dancer, passions that Jackie does not or will not share after her passing. The other actor, Jamie Draven, playing Jackie's elder son, Tony, seems like a one-trick pony, a reckless youth propelled through the film by punk music. Yet it's a disingenuous performance from the character, a small town tough exaggerating the act but crumbling under emotional strain many times, when his father fails to meet his expectations, when he discovers Billy's predilection for ballet, when Billy leaves.

I admit that I wouldn't normally choose to watch a film about a 10-year-old ballerina, male or female, but was compelled to by my wife. It has become a permanent part of our collection and though I may still not reach for it before, say, Hot Tub Time Machine or Dark City, I watch it without griping, enraptured by the nuanced performances, funky soundtrack, and, admittedly, as an Anglophile, getting my fix however I can.

For those who care, it doesn't pass the Bechdel Test, and I'd recommend that if you're not comfortable with your sexuality, give it a pass, as there's a bit of boy kissing. Roll your eyes elsewhere. Conversely, if your response is ""Who gives a S***?"" then proceed.",1370304000,,2276,4.860824742268041

1277416,5,B00003CXPD,"The title character of ""Billy Elliot"" is a boy who dances, but the film is not really about dance. Rather, it is a beautifully-acted tale of starkly opposed forces and their painful, hard-won reconciliation.

In 1984, 11-year-old Billy lives in a run-down row house in an industrial suburb of Durham, England, with his slightly senile grandmother, and his widowed father Jackie and elder brother Tony, both of whom are coal miners. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has turned the government against working people. The miners are embroiled in an increasingly violent strike. In this macho culture where the hardship of the months-long strike, economic marginalization and loss of pride have embittered working-class men, Billy discovers ballet when a white-tutu-clad group of girls begins holding their dance class in the same gymnasium as his disliked boxing lessons.

The middle-class ballet teacher, Mrs. Wilkinson, sees Billy's interest and invites him to join the dance class, and he begins to learn ballet instead of boxing. Jackie, horrified to catch Billy doing ballet, forbids him to continue. Boys, Jackie says, play football, box, or wrestle. Jackie and Tony both think ballet is strictly for girls and ""poofs."" Mrs. Wilkinson, who believes Billy has talent, agrees to continue to work with him secretly, and helps him get an audition at the Royal Ballet School in London.

You've probably heard that this is an inspiring film, and it is, but be forewarned, this is no pretty, slick Hollywood production. The filmmakers pull no punches in depicting Billy's family's grim poverty, the violence of the strike, or the bitterness of English class divisions. In one scene, Billy's father chops up his late mother's piano for firewood. The burgeoning sexuality of Billy and his friends is explored, with his friend Michael depicted as gay/transgendered. The dialogue contains dozens of f-words that may offend sensitive ""family-friendly"" American ears. (I have not lived in Northern England, but based on my experience living with a working-class family in Ireland, I found the dialogue realistic.) Mrs. Wilkinson smokes in almost every scene she appears in.

So why on earth do I say parents should see ""Billy Elliot"" with their (10 and older) kids? Because it shows children that sometimes they have to stand up to their parents to become their authentic selves. Because it shows parents that we have to let our children be themselves and love the children we have. Because, with small gestures and telling details instead of heart-tugging speeches or soaring violins, it shows that life and letting go can be more painful than we think we can stand, but we can survive and have richer, more fulfilling lives for our trouble.",1368576000,,2732,5.17420814479638

1277515,5,B00003CXPD,"I find this a really engaging film that I can watch frequently.  The photography and direction are excellent.  How the film is directed is important for me as I have some trouble with the heavy dialect used by the actors: the ample flash backs and flash asides (simultaneous action) help a lot in following the plot particularly when the actors drop their voices while still speaking in heavy dialect. (This seems to be a characteristic of many British films)
Some reviewer I've read calls it (the whole story)  ""funny.""  I tend to disagree.  There are certainly many scenes which are downright  funny. The action overall is handled with a very light, easily watched spirit - only one brief scene approaches intense drama.  BUT, to see the whole story as ""funny"" seems to me to require little empathy for a boy who is fighting his father, as Billy is.
According to the jacket notes, the only actor/actress nominated for an Academy Award was the dance teacher  -(Julie  Walters ?).  Personally, I think the actor playing Billy (Jamie Bell) is equally excellent;  a side feature on the Blue Ray includes an interview with Bell which shows a boy very different from the Billy  he plays - he really is a fine actor.",1362268800,,1211,4.714285714285714

doesnt work well to be exact not at all.  I found one scene in particular really hard to watch.  The scene involves
Billy's  gay friend and Billy dancing in the boxing ring.  All of a sudden he is discovered by his father who just looks like he could kill the boy.  Then Billy goes in a wild dance pulling out all the stops, its as if he dancing for his life.

 I danced myself right out the womb
 I danced myself right out the womb
 Is it strange to dance so soon?
 - Cosmic Dancer by T. Rex

In 2001, I went to the cinema one day to see a movie hailed as the `feel-good' movie of the year. Heart-warming, inspiring, sweet and funny, Billy Elliot, directed by Stephen Daldry, was the thing at that time. I remember waiting in line to get my ticket and glancing over at the poster. A young boy, in his trunks, standing in line between young girls in tutus, apparently going to a dance class. I was thinking that it would probably be a movie which poked fun at the fact that a boy wanted to do ballet, much ala The Full Monty. And even though Billy Elliot has glimpses of that angle on the issue, I was grateful it was so much more than just that.

Billy Elliot is a young boy living near Newcastle in 1980s miner-strike England. Coming from a family of miners who strive to get by, he discovers he likes to dance more than he wants to box and be like his dad and older brother. Billy is sweet, caring and trapped in a life that seems to be predetermined. Essentially, the film is a coming of age story, a story of being brave enough to be yourself and how fun and difficult the road to discovery is. All that's good and nice. The best thing about Billy Elliot, though, is how easily, passionately and truthfully it manages to convey the liberating feeling of dance.

There are a lot of Hollywood films that try to show how glamorous but hard, exhilarating but spirit-breaking dancing can be but most of them cling to such stereotypical representations of dance and dancers that it's better to just fast forward to the dance scenes. And, sometimes, those aren't that good either. Billy Elliot is such a special dance film because it doesn't reproduce stereotypes or, at least, tries to address them. Billy's sexuality as a dancer is, in some ways, a big part of the film as he's too young to really know yet. And when one would think that ballet would help him realise that he's gay, or reaffirm his masculinity, as in many film that concerns men dancing, the film allows for neither to happen. Billy, portrayed by Jamie Bell in a once-in-a-lifetime performance, has no such revelations, stays somewhere in between the two choices the entire time in order to make the point that dance has nothing to do with sexual orientation. Billy is a dancer. And it's the story of a dancer we're watching, above everything else.

Billy Elliot succeeds so well in showcasing how much Billy overcomes in his effort to become a dancer because the film is set, very strategically, during the miners' strike of the 1980s. Billy`s too young to be concerned with such issues but his whole family is very much affected by it and, as a result, so is he. His mother has passed away a long time and he has been raised by his dad, older brother -- two very `macho' type men -- and his grandma, who suffers from dementia. In this way, taking ballet lessons is not only controversial in terms of sex but also in terms of class as well. Again, many films deal with how ballet is considered a `high art' and the struggles to blend it with today's pop culture -- since the films are a product of that culture as well (see Save The Last Dance or Flashdance)- but they, again, merely touch upon that tension, turn it into another plot point and then find a neat resolution which suits the rule of the `mandatory' happy ending. At the opposite end, Billy Elliot places that tension in the centre of the film, definitely uses it to create some sense of suspense and agony but also goes deeper into the subject as it explores the restrictions the class system places on people which are not easy to surpass. By the end of the film, Billy's family is still, pretty much, the same in terms of class and even Billy keeps his northern accent. And even though Billy immerses himself in such a `high brow' world, through ballet, there's no clear severance of ties or the insinuation that his whole family is, by the end, taken care of because of it. It's still a struggle, as class barriers are hard to overcome.

More than anything else, Billy Elliot is about dancing and not what it takes to succeed but what it takes to really be a dancer. Dance scenes blend ballet with jazz, boogie and tap and almost appear as a somatic reaction to everything that`s happening around Billy rather than being parts of a specific choreography. Again, there are many dance films that have their protagonists spontaneously break out in dance (like in Footloose). What's so special about Billy Elliot is that this is consistently done throughout the film. It's not just in one scene which would serve to showcase how the character is a natural dancer. Billy oozes dance in almost every scene, skipping on the street, running around the house or angrily tap dancing as a reaction to his father and dance teacher fighting over him. Billy dances when he's angry, sad or emotional, happy or, even, bored. And it never gets boring, exactly because all these reactions and feelings come as a natural result of the tension between his life and background and his passion for ballet. And the film cleverly uses not only the politics of the era but, also, the soundtrack in order to connect Billy's rawness when dancing with the hard times his family is going through. From T. Rex's Children of the Revolution to probably one of the most gripping and creative tap dance scenes ever to grace a film, choreographed to The Jam's A Town Called Malice, Billy Elliot is all about how dancing can be a creative outburst in times of turmoil and trouble. Billy is going through personal turmoil, letting it all out, dancing as England crumbles under pressure at the same time. Dancing becomes a reflex, a defense mechanism, a therapeutic process, an act of resistance and the only thing of beauty in an, otherwise, grey and miserable environment all at once.

Billy Elliot is an exciting film to watch, as unique as its protagonist. It's an unusual coming of age story, as Billy`s love of dance is what makes him grow and not his first love, as it usually happens in such films. The film's cinematography is gritty and fresh, though nostalgic, its script humorous and thoughtfully emotional, its characters interesting and real, even though imagined. Above all, Billy Elliot is an extraordinary dance film as it doesn't use dance just as another metaphor for the American dream. Billy Elliot knows exactly what it feels to only be able to express yourself through dance and the freedoms that dance allows you, at that moment. It's a film that lets everyone know the truth about dance. When you dance you `forget everything. You're there, flying, like a bird. Like electricity'. And that's what watching Billy Elliot can feel like as well. Yeah, electricity",1338854400,,6897,4.603742880390562
1277855,5,B00003CXPD,When you find a story line that impacts your thoughts and attitude---it's worth seeing.  Billy Elliot has a great story line about acceptance and unconditional love between a Father and Son.,1338336000,,190,5.129032258064516
1277856,4,B00003CXPD,"I'm a sucker for movies based on true stories. This is one such, about a young English boy from a striking coal mining family who defies his father's prejudice against dancing (""It's all poofs, you know."") to learn ballet. In fact, he learns from Mrs. Weasley, in a way. That is, the actress who plays his teacher also plays Molly Weasley in the Harry Potter series. In fact, the two characters have a lot in common. Kind-hearted but tough and not into taking any BS from anyone.

The plot is a little thin and pretty predictable, but the kid is very appealing and the story is well told. I've been trying to think what my favorite scene is, and I guess it is his audition for the Royal Ballet School. He's so nervous he takes a minute to get started, but then he flies! He shows the panel he can do a huge variety of moves very well, and there they sit, trying to keep straight faces. I guess the British are better at that than I'm accustomed to, but there's a recognizable look of astonishment on several faces.

But the last question they ask him really made it for me: ""Billy, what does it feel like when you are dancing?"" He's not very articulate, but gradually he warms up to the description, and we find that he's almost a poet as well as a dancer. He's a likeable kid, and you feel good for him when he gets admitted to the school.

This movie is a wonderful coming-of-age story about a boy from a working class family who realizes that his dream is to dance, despite his brother's and his father's wishes.

I was shocked when I watched the CD recently as it has been edited and ruined in my estimation. Some of the raw street language is removed, which showed the contrast between the hardworking rough side of Billy's background and his love of dance.  The relationship between Billy's neighborhood friend was edited making it a very minor friendship which was not in the original.  All along the film I noticed minor changes that took the strong appealing part of the story away.  At the end when Billy's old friend from the neighborhood shows up at Billy's ballet debut dressed in ""drag"" with his obviously homosexual partner was completely omitted.  I thought it removed an important statement that Billy, who was ridiculed by family and some friends, as being effeminate just because he loved dancing, yet his macho friend from the neighbor turned out to be gay.  It ruined the whole story for me that I feel were important parts of the story and I think whoever is responsible made a really good story into a bland flop.",1327017600,12,1167,4.564593301435407

Billy (Jamie Bell) has recently lost his mother, and his family are struggling to survive, it is 1984 and the miners in Yorkshire are struggling against the disintegration of their way of life as a result of Margaret Thatcher's callous closure of British coal mines without providing any alternative livelihood or compensation for those dependent on the industry. Billy's father (Gary Lewis) and brother (Jamie Draven) are strongly involved in the miner's strike and the future of the family and community looks bleak. Billy's father scrapes together money to send him to boxing classes, but he doesn't enjoy them and being captivated by the girl's ballet dances he transfers to the latter, while concealing this from his family.
But his dance teacher, the abrasive but big hearted Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Walters) notices Billy's talent and is determined he should be enrolled in the Royal School of Ballet in London. The resistance of Billy's father breaks down when he see's Billy's incredible talent and he will do anything to get Billy to be able to follow his passion and have a chance at a better life
Together with a few gems like 'This England' this is one of the few movies to focus on Britain's ever neglected and abused white working class, betrayed first by Margaret Thatcher and then by the liberal and left middle class elit, on account of Third world immigrants and Muslims, Britain's white working class have been abused and kicked around by both conservatives and the left. Scenes of poverty, such as the little blond girl with her rag doll, who stands outside the council houses, add a gritty reality to a wonderful, heartwarming, inspiring and passionate movie. Notable scenes include the clash between Mrs Wilkinson and Billy's brother tony, when Billy runs away and shakes his body in angst and rage to the tune of 'A Town like Malice'. One of the best movies of 2000 and accompanied by a really powerful soundtrack, this is a highly recommended movie to watch again and again.",1302480000,2,2345,4.924242424242424

His new responsibilities include, satisfying his father's wishes, looking after his wandering grandmother, and taking his older brother's verbal abuse. Little Billy was sent for boxing lessons with the rest of the little boys. It just so happens that there aren't enough facilities to go around. Ballet is practiced in the other side of the gym by a group of young girls. Billy can't help himself. The music takes a hold of his body's motions and he is unable to concentrate on boxing. Billy's father and brother are strong participants in the coal miner's union. In between the pressures of family and his newly found passion, Billy struggles to find a balance. His father considered ballet as feminine. His brother angers the ballet instructor and accuses her of scheming. On top of everything, Billy's childhood friend, Michael, is coming forth with his homosexuality and shows a smidge of affection. Billy has a similar moment with his instructor's daughter, Debbie. Billy's father thinks about his late wife and decides to give Billy a shot at something else, rather than a future in coal mining. Everyone in the film was perfect. The dynamics of the actors as a family was very believable.  My favorite character is the father, (Gary Lewis). He gave a very moving performance and his acting is superb. I recommend this movie for anyone. I know it is rated R for profanity and whatnot, but honestly, I see no harm in labeling it PG-13 instead.

1278166,5,B00003CXPD,"I just finished watching this treasure for the eighth or ninth time.

This time I focused on Billy's Dad who has to give up SO MUCH for his son's dream. It isn't just the pawning of his deceased wife's jewelry, the last possession of any value left in the house or how beholding he has to become to friend's and neighbors for their support, but it is how he has to put aside the beliefs that those in his class associate with manhood.

His younger son, his Billy, is choosing the arts in a time when the Dad knows that there is no future in the mines for anyone. Even so, his son's choice runs so contrary to everything he believes makes a boy a man.

There are so many powerful father/son moments that it is hard to even recall them all.

I weep four or five times in this film every time. The moment of shock in a gymnasium where Billy was supposed to learn to box when he realizes that his boy not only can dance but desires to do so with his whole heart changes the direction of his life and he knows it.

The wonderful moment when Billy cries because he was accepted and his Dad's moment of triumph is dimmed by the news that the union was forced to cave in reminds us that this is not a silly story told outside of time, but in the midst of very hard times.

And the Dad and son wrestle in the grass and his Dad holds him close (much as he must have done when he was a baby) and they laugh shows how complex their relationship really is.

I could go on. I could talk about his grandma, his brother, his dancing teacher, the boxing coach. Each and every one has his own story with Billy. And then there is Billy himself. If the young actor who plays him is remembered for only one film, then this will be enough.

Maybe I will at some other time. For now. I am going for a walk. What a wonderful film.

I cannot wait until someone realizes there is a market for an enhanced DVD with commentary and background and discussion and a feature on the Ballet.

It showed that even the most intolerant of parents can be turned to support their child once they see how much it means to them and what talent they have, even in the worst situations. All the performances where great from the adults to the kids. Jamie Bell was a master a ""Billy"". I'm glad to see that he has become an A-list British actor and that he is getting so many starring roles.

1278239,5,B00003CXPD,"I was curious about the movie, not knowing what to expect.  I purchased it, and started it with an open mind.  I was pulled in right away!  It was a tale of a boy in a gritty, tough, motherless household, with rather strong father and older brother influences.  Billy is a real kid, trying to survive, trying to win dad and big brothers attention, and realizes he just isn't going to do it.
I was really impressed with the story around Billy....his family, the strike, school, all the things going on in his life.  He was trying to be a boxer to please his dad.  He wasn't into it, and wasn't good.
When he found ballet, he approached it from a very powerful, athletic view, and didn't seem the boy one would typically place in a ""ballet boy"" box.  While he is not overly handsome, he is believable.  He is caring and attractive, sensitive and wants to please, but can't.  He wants to understand his dad and brother, but doesn't.  He wants them to understand him, and they can't.
The friendship with a gay classmate is wonderful.  He really care about the boy, isn't actively pursuing him.  He portrays a boy, being a boy, who also happens to be a good dancer.
I guess, if you are looking for a young boy love story, this is not really it.  If you are looking for a strong willed boy, fighting to survive and be himself, and winning in the end, this it is.
I truly loved the movie more that I thought I would.  It went a direction I wasn't expecting, but left loving the movie.
I was really impressed with the passion of the young actor playing Billy.  A really touching story, and it was great seeing his dad becoming more of a man by letting his son follow his heart, and letting him dance.

1278243,5,B00003CXPD,"The Cortonwood Colliery in Yorkshire, UK,  closed in 1984. This was to be the first of 20 mine closures with the loss of 20,000 jobs. The UK Miners' Union responded by calling for a national strike, a major industrial action affecting the entire British coal industry. At it's height 165,000 miners were out on strike. In many communities miners' wives pushed the struggle forward, joining picket lines and arranging communal food kitchens. The Tory government used the state's resources to put more and more police into the coal fields and on the picket lines, frequently with violent and bloody consequences. After 51 weeks on strike, a special delegate conference of the National Union of Mineworkers voted by 98 to 91 votes to return to work. This was a defining moment in British industrial relations, and its defeat significantly weakened the British trade union movement. It was also seen as a major political and ideological victory for Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and her Conservative Party. At one point during the strike, in a speech to Tory M.P.'s, Prime Minister Thatcher stated, ""We had to fight the enemy without in the Falklands. We always have to be aware of the enemy within,"" (referring to the striking miners), ""which is much more difficult to fight and more dangerous to liberty.""

It is against this grim backdrop that ""Billy Elliot"" begins. Eleven year-old Billy, (Jamie Bell), is the son of a widowed coal miner, (Gary Lewis). Their beloved wife and mother died the year before. Billy, his father, older brother, Tony, (Jamie Draven), and live-in grandmother, (Jean Heywood), reside in the fictional coal-mining town of ""Everington,"" in northeast England. The movie is actually shot in the real County Durham, UK. Billy looks after his grandmother, who has Alzheimer's, but never lets anyone forget that she could have been a professional dancer if marriage hadn't gotten in the way of her potential career. Cinematographer Brian Tufano does a magnificent job of depicting the beauty of the local, with its quaint brick houses and nearby green fields. The ocean can often be seen in the background as the characters walk through the streets. It's as if the picturesque surroundings can ameliorate the bleakness of the situation.

The movie opens with Billy playing a recording of ""Cosmic Dancer"" by T-Rex. He exuberantly leaps and dances to the sound of the music as if to escape his oppressive surroundings. He deeply mourns the loss of his  ""Mum,"" and since both his Dad and brother are out on strike, the repressed anger and depression at home couldn't get much worse. As Billy runs outside to search for his wandering ""Gran,"" he sees, from the fields, a group of policemen, gathering, armed with riot shields and clubs. The threat of explosive violence is a constant throughout the movie, even with its wonderfully upbeat, and frequent comic moments.

Billy takes boxing lessons at a local gym, to uphold the family tradition. Both his father and brother excel at the sport. Unfortunately, our young protagonist is not a chip off the old block, pugilistically speaking. His footwork is fabulous, but he really doesn't want to hit anyone. He is fascinated, however, by the ballet class which is being taught at the same gym. The irrepressible Billy takes a few classes, spending his 50 pence for dancing lessons rather than boxing. He even takes a book from the local library on ballet and practices the positions secretly in the bathroom. Stern, chain-smoking ballet mistress, Mrs. Wilkinson, (Julie Walters), immediately spots the boy's talent.

Naturally, Billy's Dad discovers that his youngest son is not boxing. He also finds out what Billy is doing instead. Mr. Elliot is furious, and tells Billy, ""Lads do football or boxin' or wrestlin'! Not friggin' ballet!"" Billy responds, ""It's not just poofs, Dad! Some ballet dancers are as fit as athletes."" Mr. Elliot is primarily angry, however, because he believes that Billy has been wasting money. The miners are on strike and money is very scarce. He forces Billy to give up the class. But Mrs. Wilkinson continues to teach him privately, at no monetary cost. She seems to come alive while working with the budding dancer. She pours her emotions into his training, and encourages him to audition for the Royal Ballet School. The two work together rigorously...as rigorously as for boxing, wrestling or football.

Billy is also encouraged by his best friend, Michael, who is having difficulties coming to grips with his own puberty - a confusing time for anyone. He is a closet cross dresser and not afraid to wear his sister's school uniform or apply make-up. Michael urges Billy to be himself and to follow his dream.

The film's suspense peaks during the day of Billy's audition where multiple things happen at once - both at the dance academy and at the home front - which have a dramatic effect on Billy and his family.

Director Stephen Daldry really focuses on the relationship, the strong bonds of love, between father and son. Daldry assembled a wonderful cast, which brings to life the struggles and triumphs of Lee Hall's script. Their speaking accents do take some getting used to, though. But if you're renting or own the DVD, you can always play back the initial scenes until you get used to the speech patterns. The musical/dance montages are magical. Passion and love for dance permeate the film. However, the grim political and economic circumstances surrounding the storyline are ever present. Jamie Bell is phenomenal in the title role. He gives a riveting, sensitive, dynamic performance.

I just saw the theatrical production on Broadway and was curious as to how film would measure up. The show was/is extraordinary and the movie does not disappoint.

From the opening titles, as we watch Billy (Jamie Bell) expressing pure joy through movement, to the rolling credits at the end of the movie, where we have experienced the joy of dance through the heart and soul of a poor and grieving boy, my fantasy is that most viewers are jumping around the room, remembering how good it felt to dance before we became self conscious.  The acting is superb, the writing is superb, the story is engrossing and transformative.  Watch this movie if you need a lift, an inspiration to move, or if you just want to have a joyful experience.

1278246,5,B00003CXPD,"Billy Elliott lives in a sad and depressive coal mining town in Northern England. There are few local pleasures to be had, police in riot gear are on their ever-present guard throughout the streets, and the whole thing in general is a confluence of rusted metal doors and brick tenements that look like they are built haphazardly on top of each other. Billy, like the rest of the young men in the village, goes to daily boxing practice in order to keep up repressive prototypes of machismo that all the men in the town must ascribe to. Unfortunately he is not very good at it, but is does have natural and immediately evident talent in the ballet classes which get taught in the same gym as soon as boxing practice ends. Soon Billy finds his true calling in the art, all the while keeping it a secret from his drunk and depressive father and brother, themselves caught in their own strife with the ongoing Miners Strike that plagued their part of the country at that time.

Billy Elliot is a film about staying true to yourself and ignoring adversity. It is about finding what's right for you and following it with everything you've got. It is about using your God-given talent to improve yourelf and get yourself out of your current sad reality. It is about not judging others, about kindness. As a film it works beautifully. The screenplay is witty, the characters are true, the storyline fantastical but not at all improbable. Films like this are so simple and sweet and rare that to criticize them is to take away from the intentions of the piece. Some things should be simply celebrated for elevating man's present condition and for being so intentionally open and, in large part, free.

1278344,5,B00003CXPD,"One of my friends recently told me that `Billy Elliot' was a solid A+ multiplied by one-thousand.  That was enough to get me to search it out and watch it, since I had really up until that point heard very little about it at all.  When I read the back of the DVD case this big smile forced itself onto my face, for `Billy Elliot' is just my kind of movie.  Then I watched it, and while I don't know about the whole `multiplied by one-thousand' bit, I can truly say that `Billy Elliot' is a sold A+ and is most definitely the greatest movie of the year that was 2000 (yes, I have finally placed bias aside and concluded that `Gladiator' wasn't the greatest movie of the year; but of the Academy's final five I have no doubt it was the deserved winner).

Billy Elliot is an eleven-year-old boy who lives with his father and brother in a small coal mining town in England.  Billy's father Jackie works hard to provide for his boys, but with the current strike forcing him to the picket lines monies are now very difficult to come by.  Still, Jackie scrimps together whatever he can to send Billy to boxing lessons.  When Billy catches a glimpse of Mrs. Wilkinson's ballet class though, he is instantly enamored and desires to dance as apposed to box.  Of course the idea of a boy dancing is looked down on and so Billy keeps his lessons secret, but his secret is soon unveiled and he has to learn to stand up for himself and persevere despite any opposition from his family and friends.

`Billy Elliot' (originally titled `Dancer', and I'm so glad they changed the title since `Dancer' almost adds to the feminine stereotypes the film is fighting against in my opinion) is a beautiful testament to the human spirit and to the right that each and everyone of us has be exactly who we want to be, regardless of others opinions or expectations.  The people around Billy seem ignorant and narrow-minded, condemning Billy for his interest and talent, but through conviction and dedication Billy is able to change the minds of those who oppose him.

The performances in this film are all phenomenal.  Even small performances like Jamie Draven (who plays Billy's older brother Tony) and Jean Heywood (who plays Billy's Grandmother) are memorable and exciting.  Julie Walters, who plays Billy's dance instructor Mrs. Wilkinson, scored an Oscar nomination for her performance in the film (although is she really supporting?) and rightfully so, for her effortless mix of tenacity and compassion helps create a brilliant canvas for Billy.  Gary Lewis is amazing as Billy's father.  Throughout the film he comes across so raw and real, like a real father and not a Hollywood fabrication (he's neither too lenient nor is he too restrictive) and his final scene, just his face and that stare of awe, made me cry.  Stuart Wells is also fabulous as Billy's best friend Michael.  He matches Bell's charisma and naturalness frame for frame.

But this is the Billy show, and so Jamie Bell gets top honors for creating a character that is believable and understandable and relatable.  His performance (which rightfully won him a BAFTA) is utterly outstanding.  How he missed out on the Oscar nomination is beyond me, for he captures every ounce of Billy's struggle magically.  I love the way that when Billy is around other people he walks with a swagger, an almost forced manliness.  I noticed this first when he was leaving the bookstore.  He had been looking at the ballet book and was called out on it and so his leave, this macho walk as if he were a tough boy, felt as though he were compensating, as if his masculinity had been challenged and he had to defend it.  These small details may go unnoticed by many, but when you do notice them you come to realize the brilliance that was this performance.

I want to make a quick mention of the outstanding soundtrack, which really plays much like its own character in the film.  Each song is a perfect compliment to the scene in which it embodies.

`Billy Elliot' is such a heartwarming film and really should be seen by everyone (the course language may not be suitable for children, but you know your kids better than I do).  The story itself is so beautiful and the touching relationship that forms between father and son as the film draws to its conclusion is almost too poignant for words.  There aren't too many excellent father/son dramas made today, and despite being about so much more than that, the sheer satisfaction that comes from watching this fathers love for his son triumph in the end is the one thing that sticks with me longer and stronger than any other facet of the film.",1218153600,5,4623,4.638036809815951

1278437,5,B00003CXPD,"I was a ballet and dance performer in high school when this film first came out, and it struck me as one of the most genuine movies since.

Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell) is part of a family that, without a mother, flows with strong masculine influence; he takes boxing lessons regularly by his fathers influence, but young Billy seems to be unable to connect with the sport.  Once he discovers the ballet class of a schoolmate, he begins to practice with them, awakening a passion inside of him that would guide him through trial and tribulation before he can share this joy with the world around him.

This film is honest in several key areas.  When I was in school, it was expected of me to play football or wrestling, as opposed to ballet in dance.  My typical rebuttal would be that it is better to spend evenings around girls in tights then on football fields grabbing other men.  For me it was a sense of humor that allowed me to consider my passion ""normal,"" but young Elliot cannot define his passion, even by the end of the film.

When asked at the conclusion of his audition for the Royal Ballet School, ""what does it feel like, when you're dancing?"" He responds ""I don't know."" Sensing the dissatisfaction of the panel which will determine if he can enter the school, he tries to define it as best he can.  Speaking from experience, there are some passions that are simply so truely and deply a part of you that you cannot simply ""justify"" them with words, they are simply a part of you.

This film is true and honest to that passion; for ballet enthusiasts, you'll immediately understand the ""political"" development around what is ""normal"" for a young ballet performer.  As a non-influenced audiencemember, you're bound to appreciate every conflict, frustration, denial and accomplishment that is so masterfully displayed on screen.  Filled with scenes that will bring any family audience closer together, this film is truly as honest and heartfelt as they come.",1214092800,3,1970,4.730994152046784
1278438,5,B00003CXPD,"I had the rare treat of seeing the reincarnation of the movie ""Billy Elliot"" as a musical in the falls of 2005 and 2006 in London's West End where it is a huge hit. On January 10, 2009, I saw the musical for the third time--this time in Manhattan where it was every bit as good as in London. For me it is one of the best works of the last decade. With a variety of musical styles by Elton John the stage show is a masterful production finally to be produced in the U.S. in the fall of 2008. The movie itself is a skillfully crafted work, highly original, affecting, and perfectly cast.
In Billy's small mining town in northern England in the anti-labor Thatcher era, the miners are on strike. There's a heavy, oppressive police presence. The police are as much symbolic and iconic as they are real, and act as a mute chorus to the action throughout the movie. In one scene Billy is walking with a girl, and as they stroll she lightly taps the successive shields held by a line of silent, unmoving cops; the police are robotic, mechanistic, inhuman but menacing presences.
Billy has the audacity to prefer ballet classes to the manly boxing classes his striking father is paying fifty p for him to attend. Jamie Bell as eleven year-old Billy is a superb dancer, who is given masculine, very original pieces to interpret. His acting is equally brilliant. The dance teacher played to the hilt by Julie Walters is a tour de force performance. There's sentimentality, but it's humanity that triumphs here.
This is a brilliant, highly innovative, pioneering film.  The ending with adult dancer Adam Cooper is truly memorable, a heart stopper for those familiar with Matthew Bourne's great work for male dancers.",1211673600,,1705,4.645695364238411

The boy is fantastic, rightfully praised for a superb performance. Actually, as far as that goes, the entire cast is great. There are numerous small but crucial roles. The entire family, of course, is crucial, but each actor makes the most of some very brief but moving scenes. Grandma's goodbye is powerful, for example, as is the brother's hard hitting performance as the committed striker. The father is magnificent, really perfect. The teacher gives a rather restrained performance. She is very good, though, especially with the cigarette ever dangling, which she makes a critical prop in the development of her character. (It is nice to see a real smoker again.) Her daughter, too, is rather good, although she disappears more or less, and is replaced by the gay neighborhood boy who comes many years later to see Billy dance in ""Swan Lake"". The teacher and Billy make a valiant effort to disassociate dance from gayness, but the last scene of the film, with the gays spotlighted in the audience, seems to suggest that the father and his friends were right after all.

1278507,5,B00003CXPD,"As a hint as to the high quality of this excellent film, notice that this film has a higher proportion of '5' scores among a large number of raters than the vast majority of films. It is a very well crafted piece of art.

The film is about the human spirit and the motivations to excel and to experience life fully. Billy is a young boy who becomes entranced with dance, an art form that allows him to express his emotions and experience a deeper connection with himself. He is reared in a working class neighborhood with a rough father and older brother, both of whom are miners on strike. Billy's mother has died and this boy interested in dance must survive in a highly tense highly aggressive home and neighborhood. Jamie Bell plays the role to perfection and deserves incredible credit for being able to carry off this lead role with such fine acting skills and ability to become the character Billy Elliot before our eyes.

The film is also about his dance teacher and mentor, played perfectly by the wonderful actress Julie Walters. She is the perfect mentor, pressing the student when he needs to be pressed but recognizing that for every step she takes, he must also make a step.  The best mentors know that they can't do it for the mentee. Walters is an incredible actress, being able to be vulnerable and controlled at the same time. She recognizes that the role she has taken on in regard to Billy's budding talent is that of protector and teacher and that at some point he will move beyond her if her work is done. Walters embodies and channels this aspect of the mentor perfectly.

Gary Lewis is superb as Jackie Elliot, Billy's father. He plays a middle aged coal miner, still in grief over the loss of his wife, trying to make ends meet in a home with two sons. At first Jackie is furious that his son wants to become a dancer, but gradually the father sees the hopelessness that he and his older son experience as miners on strike, and supports his son in following his passion and breaking into a new world of opportunities and experiences.

Excellent in every way, this tale is about the growth of the human spirit but thoughtfully explores the roles of those who facilitate that growth.",1193875200,2,2206,4.5465994962216625

Set against the backdrop of the 1984 miners' strike in Durham County, ""Elliot"" has an acute eye for working-class sensibilities, but the main focus of this exhilarating story concerns Billy's efforts to translate raw talent into self-realization.

This is the classic ""family doesn't initially understand,"" ""teacher believes in him,"" ""screws up audition but spirit carries him through"" type movie.  It's put together quite nicely, and you never really know how it is going to turn out.

The transition from ballet dancing to tap/jazz seemed to happen in one day, which seemed jarring.

1278609,5,B00003CXPD,"I have been looking for Billy Elliot for more than two years. I heard that it should be very good or even excellent film and another reason for watching it was that I have seen several Working Title films before (About a Boy, Notting Hill, Love Actually, Four Weddings and a Funeral) and I found all of them much more sincere and emotional than average Hollywood products. Also these British films have something to offer that you rarely can find in Hollywood movies: a charming heartwarming mixture of sweet and funny comedy and inspiring and touching drama. Last month, finally, I found the tape. From very first moments of the movie my eyes were riveted to the screen and when the movie ended feelings and emotions overflowed me. Billy Elliot in my opinion Billy Elliot is a brilliant movie, easily one of the best movies of the year and most likely of the current decade.

Director of the movie Stephen Daldry brought to us an exceptional, truly inspiring and moving, emotional and poignant movie. The entire story and all the characters are completely believable and the atmosphere of small provincial town somewhere in North-Eastern England skillfully captured and transmitted to us. Sometimes the movie is sad, sometimes it's funny but Stephen Daldry's work never leave you indifferent. The story occurs in a small coal-mining town in 1984 and there are signs of a severe depression all over the town. You can see all around a shadow of distress and even poverty. Some simple but incredibly powerful scenes bring to us sad feeling of hopelessness and even despair. There is a big coalminers strike in the town but it's easy to see that it's also the hopeless strike. But all this is only a masterfully recreated background for main story of the title character, a twelve years old boy. He recently lost his mother and both his father and elder brother are striking coalminers. Billy is forced by his father to attend boxing classes and one day accidentally he see the girl ballet classes that occur in same room and he find ballet much more interesting than hated stupid boxing. So he attends those ballet classes instead the boxing and there is nothing surprising that after a few weeks his father suddenly finds out that Billy didn't attend boxing and worst of all he is attending the ballet classes. The main conflict occurs.

Billy must fight for his choice, fight against his own family. There are two stereotypes against him. First one is that ballet for girls, not for boys (lads do football... or boxing... or wrestling). And second sounds even worse: all male ballet dancers are gays. Billy is not but no one from his family except aged grandma want even heard about ballet. There are only two people in the whole town, who support him - middle-aged ballet teacher Mrs. Wilkinson and his friend Michael, who is the same age as Billy and who found that he is possibly a gay. This gay subplot easily became for conservative audience a very controversial question. But the fact is that such stereotypes are not invented by the director of the movie and if you would try to learn more about this terrific picture you will found that Jamie Bell, who took dance lessons from age six, suffered from similar sneers and taunts. Billy's problem is that he must fight not only against bad obstacles and misunderstanding but also against strong social stereotypes. Several brilliant come scenes and bright humor greatly emphasize the struggles of the main hero.

Jamie Bell playing Billy has on of the best performances ever among young actors. His performance (and particularly dance sequences) is so genuine, bright and sincere that all the time we can easily feel an expression of a young boy, not a director, choreographer or writer. BAFTA award for best actor of the year is well-deserved and it is pity that conservatism of the Academy too often becomes an insuperable obstacle for many great movies. Julie Walters (an Academy nomination for best supporting actress) as Billy's ballet teacher also did a great job as a talented woman as a talented women who forced to teach in small provincial town for pitiful salary. The chemistry between teacher and student is another great line in Billy Elliot. Two other important supporting characters - Billy's father and elder brother Tony are also excellent and their evolution is perfectly showed by Stephen Daldry's direction. The beautiful soundtrack is a perfect combination of a classic (including a nice reference to great Swan Lake) and modern music.

The original ""R"" rating shouldn't mislead you. Except for strong language it should be easily a PG-13. But this is a very rare case where some strong language and profanity are necessary for authenticity and characters understanding. The movie is suitable for teens and it definitely is able to give some good lessons for them.

10 out of 10 looks well deserved. Thanks for reading and sorry for my bad English",1160784000,4,4922,4.868735083532219
1278610,5,B00003CXPD,"1984 in the UK: it was the worst of times.  Young British boy Billy Elliott had just lost his Mum.  His Dad and older brother were on strike with the other miners.  Whether they knew it or not, a lifestyle was ending.

But, something caught a spark in Billy--not at the boxing lessons his father gave him 50 pence to attend, but from watching the ballet class of girls just outside the boxing ring.

He joined that class in secret and that spark caught fire.  Despite his father's opposition, he trained til he managed to convince his father he needed a chance at a better life.

While this film is very serious in nature, there's a lightness and a hope even in the worst of it.  This is a very enjoyable watch and one I believe would be good to see again and again.",1159315200,2,766,4.270833333333333

It showed how a person should follow their dream no matter the obstacles.  I particularly like how they handled the friendship between Billy and his gay friend.  This was only tangential to the story but it provided some real insight into character -- something that is missing in most Hollywood movies today.

Quite a kick in the pants for the older generation of grandparents and parents who were raised in the help wanted men and help wanted women classified ads of their generation. It's more about breaking stereotypes and staying true to your vision than it is about dance steps.

1278686,4,B00003CXPD,"This is a heartwarming film, made all the more delightful by the wonderful, breakout performance of newcomer, Jamie Bell, in the leading role of Billy Elliot. The son and brother of coalminers, Billy is given boxing lessons by his father but is drawn, instead, to learning ballet. So, he surreptitiously takes ballet lessons. When his father finds out, all hell breaks loose, as in the macho world of his coalminer father and brother, this is tantamount to a sign that Billy is gay.

Billy's teacher, however, thinks Billy has talent, and attempts to persuade the father to permit Billy to audition for the Royal Ballet School. At first, the father refuses. He is ultimately won over, when Billy gives him a private dance performance so passionate that even he is moved, So, Billy then goes off to London for the audition. What happens next is sure to move even the most stone hearted viewer.

This is ultimately a film about hope and the ability to realize one's dreams. Well acted, it is a film that is sure to delight the viewer.

I love this movie.  It is charming, honest, and uplifting.  Gary Lewis is wonderful as Billy's father.  We see him change from a bitter, defeated man to a proud and happy dad.  Julie Walters gives a heartfelt performance as the tough teacher with a heart of gold.  Jamie Bell, in his movie debut, is natural and sweet, a good dancer, and a sensitive actor.  This is a movie you'll want to watch more than once, because it's that good.

Watching the relationship and understanding evolve between father and son is definitely the highlight of the movie. It is not just for dance fans; it is for anyone who enjoys a heartwarming story. Definitely one of my favorites!",1123718400,,403,5.8474576271186445
1278744,5,B00003CXPD,"""Billy Elliot"" is British theatrical director Stephen Daldry's film debut, and what a seamless crossover. Even more amazing is the acting debut of Jamie Bell in the title role. Rumor has it that some 2000 young boys were ruled out first, but it's a wonder anyone was found who met the criteria at all. Despite his youth, Bell gives a top-notch performance as both a dancer AND an actor.

This is a story of a family in a mining town in north England during a strike in 1984. Billy's Dad and older brother are both miners, and his Mom is recently deceased. Billy has been enrolled in boxing lessons, but takes an interest in the ballet class across the gym, and the dance instructor quickly picks up on this. Inevitable conflicts ensue, etc. That's enough plot information; I'm just here to tell you that everyone involved in ""Billy Elliot"" contributed their best efforts to make it a fine film, and succeeded. In addition to the aforementioned Daldry and Bell, there is Jamie Draven as Billy's brother Tony, Gary Lewis as Billy's father, and Julie Walters as his dance teacher. The movie contains drama without sensationalism, much humor, and of course music and dance; something for everyone.

There is some coarse language, but it's not gratuitous. And surprisingly, the T Rex-based soundtrack fits in perfectly. I'm  willing to go out on a limb here and suggest that not only will ""Billy Elliot"" hold up to repeated viewings, but actually improve  with them. A winner!",1119657600,3,1471,4.8023715415019765

The language is course, but depicts the tough outspoken people of the mining communites in England and is appropriate in the movie, however parents should be warned.  My teens watched the movie and loved it, they don't use bad language and I knew that watching this movie would not cause them to start.  I warned them of the language prior to watching, but that is all.  They really enjoyed it and have seen it again and again.

1278746,4,B00003CXPD,"Billy Elliot, brings to the screen the story of a boy growing up in Northern England as he discovers his love for dancing.  The setting is 1984.  The government and the coal miners are in the middle of a dispute, which the former will eventually win.  As a result, Billy's family cannot afford the basics yet alone Dance School.

Billy Elliot is a film about human relations, hope and second chances, but most importantly about trust, love, integrity, and inner strength.

Jamie Bell, Gary Lewis, Julie Walters, Nicola Blackwell, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are extraordinary to say the least!  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows!

The only setbacks are in relation to why did Billy not get together with Debbie, his teacher's daughter, since they both seem to hit it off so well, and secondly what was the point of ""Michael?""  Why even include this character in the film???  The movie was just fine without him.

Moreover, Billy's father and more so his brother Tony, were extremely rude to his teacher when a simple ""no thanks"" would suffice.  Yes, they are going through difficult times, but that is no reason to be so overly impolite.  Therefore, that was not very realistic.

Aside from that, the plot, the setting, and the music, are all wonderful!

Overall, it is a movie definitely worth watching, and even though you might want to stop short of adding it to your collection, it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!",1113091200,,1536,4.812977099236641

Billy Elliot is about a boy who decides not to continue the boxing lessons his father wishes him to take, and opts instead for ballet lessons. Billy has to confront everyone's prejudices about males dancing ballet, especially his brother and father's, as well as maneuver ways to continue lessons.

Billy Elliot is done very much in the style of old 1950s movies, but it includes more modern-day themes and confronts issues of sexuality that the likes of Humphrey Bogart and Cary Grant never would have seen in their movies.

Admittedly, it's kind of a corny story. But I like it. What can I say?",1112054400,,805,4.425675675675675
1278748,5,B00003CXPD,"...Billy Elliot captures and propels the importance of creativity and in this film the discovery of Billy's talent seems to somehow heal and transcend a families collective pain.

 Set agaisnt the backdrop of the 1984 miner's strike in England, the Elliot family reside in a small North Eastern coal town.

 Bily's Father and Brother are striking miner's and his sweet Grandmother is slowly loosing her grip on reality; the family is also fractured by the recent loss of Billy's Mum. All of them seem to quietly grieving and seathingly blaming each other.

 Money is tight and the existance is gritty with little hope of change.

 Billy stumbles across dance lessons in the local recreation hall when his ""boxing"" lessons prove pointless.

 His dance teacher spots his potential and the story develops around his budding talent which clashes awkwardly with the macho culture he finds himself in.

 There are some sublime moments of tender comedy, particularly with Billy's friends Michael and the dance teacher's daughter, Debbie. These moments perfectly capture the free and developing spirit of children as they struggle to assimilate this and their social expectations.

 Billy's dancing is energetic and emotive and appears to be a cross between gritty modern moves and bouncy balletic/tap.

 The number's are full of energy and raw emotion, Billy's tantrum dance to the Jam's ""Town called Malice"" is particularly memorable.

 Culture clash and intimidation intrude again when Billy and his Father have to attend an audition at the tightly upper crust Royal Ballet School in London.

 A wonderful film with some excellent performances, Bell is absolutley cracking. Walters is good as the disaffected dance teacher but for me Billy's Father and his freind Michael are strikingly memorable and powerful.",1111968000,,1805,5.266666666666667
1278749,4,B00003CXPD,"This British film is much like many other contemporary British films billed as comedies (like The Full Monty or Brassed Off). They chronicle (even if in the backdrop) dying industry, layoffs, unemployment, labor problems: truly depressing things. Upon first viewing of these films, I am struck more by the palpable sense of hopelessness that exists in the background, even if the main story of each film is meant to be hopeful. Depressing circumstances take several attempts to get past in order to see the funny or heartwarming story within. In this case, a boy's father (a man's man miner) scrimps and saves during hard times (a mining strike) to send his son to boxing lessons. The son instead discovers he is both more interested in and has a talent for ballet and uses his father's money for ballet lessons, lying to his father about what he is doing. When it becomes clear that his talent goes well beyond what the teaching in their northern English town can offer, Billy's instructor suggests that he apply to study in London. Family problems thus ensue, with both Billy's father and brother (both striking miners and ""macho"") criticizing Billy, barring Billy from this ""homosexual way of life"", etc. In the end, Billy triumphs, perhaps because his talent is too great to deny, perhaps because his father finally sees that this a ticket for Billy to avoid the kind of hard and uncertain life he has had to endure.",1111622400,,1420,4.823770491803279

1278809,5,B00003CXPD,"This film is a real winner.  Set against the backdrop of the coalminer's strike of the late 1980's in Northern England, the film is about an adolescent boy(Jamie Bell) who wants to pursue ballet instead of more manly pursuits such as boxing despite the social and economic pressures that are against such a dream.  Jamie Bell is just luminous as Billy.  You can feel the fire that burns inside him as he pursues this dream.  My favorite scene in the film is one where he dances his frustrations out of anger with the Jam's ""A Town Called Malice"" playing on the soundtrack.  Good support is offered here by Gary Lewis as Billy's father, a widower who has the burden of raising his family and also towing the union line in the miner's strike.  Julie Walters is equally fine as Billy's sympathetic ballet teacher.  What I did like about the film is that it effectively portrayed it's sympathies for the striking miners without going over-the-top.  There was a film called ""Brassed Off"" that was released a few years earlier that I thought was too heavy-handed in it's politics to be effective.  On a final note, I love the use of T-Rex music on the soundtrack.",1101513600,,1157,4.632352941176471

Basically, the overall plot is that if you are a guy, you don't have to be gay to dance ballet, but the story presents us with the following facts:  Billy is very uncomfortable with his girlfriend, turning down a kiss offered to him by her(and more) offering her a pillow fight as a diversion; Billy seems quite comfortable with his gay guy friend(nothing wrong with that),he even kisses him goodby near the end; Billy shows homophobia at the Royal Ballet School when a fellow male student innocently touches his hand to console him; finally, when we see Billy dancing as a professional adult, he is in a famous homoerotic version of Swan Lake.  Gee wiz, we might almost conclude that maybe the story is trying to tell us something else here.  Of course these issues are not resolved in the story.  I still recommend this movie highly(there are also some wonderful surreal elements to the story,such as when Billy's girlfriend innocently runs a stick across a line of riot policemen as if they were a picket fence); it is definitely worth seeing, but why is this aspect not being discussed?",1092009600,6,1418,4.611111111111111

1278817,5,B00003CXPD,"When my friend recommended we see this film, I really didn't remember hearing about it.  When I saw the cover, I realized I had passed by it in the video store a million times without interest.  It seemed like the story of some little innocent kid having a good time...perhaps he would meet a fairy or a magical mushroom or something.
Boy was I wrong on that one.  This movie is truly one of the best I had seen in 2003...and I saw it at least twice and got different things out of it each time.  The basic storyline is about an 11-year-old boy in a miner's family who discovers that he prefers to join the girls for ballet class rather than go to his boxing class.
When his father finds out that he's been spending money & time to learn ballet, he completely flips out.  (A little predictable, yes.)  But, the storyline is complex enough that you are able to sympathize with the father's point of view.  He & his older son are part of the HUGE miner's strike in the early 1980's in the Northern England the helped change the industry forever.  This strike - and the resulting poverty of many in their town - is a draining & disabling blow for a tough man who has lost his wife, is trying to keep his older son in line, and has to cut up or sell every last thing he cherishes in order to keep his family alive.
It is against this backdrop that one young boy discovers that he loves dance.  Emotionally, you don't know where to turn.  On one hand, you are delighted that this boy is able to find some sort of outlet for his pent-up anger, joy, sadness, fear & hope.  On the other, you realize that this is not an ideal time or place for such a discovery...and the father has enough on his plate without needing to have a Disney-esque type transformation required of him.
As the story progresses, it is perhaps a little predictable.  (Except when Billy beats up the little rich boy.  That was unexpected and fairly amusing.)  However, I think the genius of the film lies not in the uniqueness of the plotline but rather in the human story told via this plotline.  The acting is absolutely suberb as you are drawn into this tale of strikers battling policemen, the intense loyalty of the miners to each other, children beginning to grow up, a tough little boy finding an array of hope, and the unexpected support a bunch of burned-out characters can give to each other when their hope is renewed.
I want to make a special mention of Billy's ballet teacher because I think she is one of my favorite movie characters.  While Billy's father & brother & best friend, etc. are all great characters, I really loved this woman.  She was as tough as nails and as burned out as a middle-class wife & mother could be in such a tough period...and yet you respect her for how she holds herself, for how she hangs on, and for her selfless interest in at least one little boy.  I don't think she's an easy character to summarize & dismiss.
BTW - a special note to viewers.  This movie employs cursing as a way of expressing some of the emotion of the day.  I don't think it's forced at all, and the British accent & terms don't make it as offensive to our ears.  However, I wouldn't recommend you watch this if it will be a problem.",1073952000,5,3215,4.342809364548495

1278887,5,B00003CXPD,"""Billy Elliot"" is one of the all-time best movies I have ever seen.  I've raised two boys of my own, and let me tell you, Jamie Bell's portrayal of adolescent angst, boy-style is flawless.  I've actually witnessed my thirteen year-old son pound something and then punch the air in impotent rage as Billy did after his father forbade him to take any more dance lessons, and when Billy's teacher chastised him for not practicing and Billy angrily responded that he couldn't do what she was asking, my son, recognizing the problem immediately, sagely stated,""He can't do it because he's angry.""  When Billy told off his teacher for always telling him what to do ""the same as everybody else,"" I asked my daughter if it reminded her of anybody, and she laughed and said,""Yeah, Brian! (the aforementioned 13 year old).  When Billy danced out his anger and frustration at not being heard and at having no control over anything that was happening to him or to his family, and then came smack up against a wall, pounding it and giving it one last elbow-jab before sinking into sullen silence, Brian, again recognizing himself, said, ""I make that face.""  It's hard to believe that Jamie Bell had almost no acting experience before he made this movie.  I believe he is going to be a force to reckon with in the movie world.
Aside from Jamie Bell's spectacular acting and dancing, the other characters were perfectly cast and acted. Julie Walters (Educating Rita) as the chain-smoking dance teacher who both mothers and pushes Billy to the limit is at her absolute best, as is Gary Lewis as the grieving, angry, bewildered father.
The story itself was at once heartbreaking and heartwarming without being either contrived or shmaltzy.

The British movie ""Billy Elliot"", produced by Stephen Daldrey in 2000 is about a boy who faces the problems to become a famous ballet dancer in the time of the miner's strikes.
He lives with his grandma, father and brother together in the most difficult time for miners (70's - 80's). So they all have their own problems and it looks as if the family would break especially as the father, who wants his son to do boy sports like boxing, finds out about his son's dancing ambitions. But Billy has a strong will and stands by his dream to become a dancer. He reaches his aim and in the final scene you can see him in a real big theatre.
You can immediately see that it is not one of those  Hollywood productions again. The colours are different, colder and the story/plot really tells us an interesting story.
The camera moves fit perfectly to the scenes presented and create a perfect atmosphere for the watcher.
Just like the music that is in this case important, because if you listen very carefully to the text of the songs you can connect it with the plot of the scenes. It is especially important  when Billy dances to it, for example in the scene in which he encounters his father in the sports club and Billy wants to show him that he can, wants and will dance. Or take the scene when Mrs Wilkinson comes to Billy's house and has a fight with Tony while Billy stands on the table and just cannot take it. Suddenly you can see him dancing with all his emotions, power, fear and hatred. This is the one scene in which you cannot only see but feel that dancing is for Billy the way to express himself..
The actors are very well chosen. Jamie Bell plays such a lovely Billy Elliot just like you had imagined him after reading the book. And that is also true for the other actors like July Walters as Mrs Wilkinson or Gary Lewis as Jackie Elliot, the strict father who succeeds in  overcoming his inhibitions to help Billy's dream of dancing come true.

Anyone who has known the pangs associated with being different and not fitting in can relate to this fine movie.
I have seen this movie again and again. The poignant ending still makes my eyes water.
What makes this movie even more meaningful is that it is based on a real little boy's experience. Additionally, I read recently that for the first time ever the Royal Ballet has more young men enrolled than young girls and all because of this great little movie.

1278956,5,B00003CXPD,"""A wonderful movie experience, in all the best senses of that phrase. Great story, acting, social relevance, music, dance, heart-felt emotion, a real pleasure.""  If the review is all that you wanted to hear, you can stop reading; the rest is a review of the reasons why I think 98 percent of the reviewers liked this movie (they EXPERIENCED IT!) and 2 percent did not, (they are the CRITICS).
In my opinion, Cinema is the most powerful artistic expression of the 20th and 21st centuries, because it combines all the other arts (except maybe sculpture?) in ONE single mind-blowing experience.  You have visual art, photography, music, dance, drama, writing, acting, sometimes even mime, yes even poetry, AT THE SAME TIME.  What a concept!
As if that were not enough, they throw in satire, comedy, social comment, history, and education, and test your opinion on the social mores of the day (homophobia, feminism, anti-war feelings, patriotism, you name it).
WHO CARES if sometimes the direction is forced, the acting is over the top, the story is predictable, the music is intrusive, the conclusion is inevitable, there is swearing, there is sex (sometimes), the realism is too much, and yes, your emotions are manipulated by Sony or Miramax.  SO WHAT!
I went to see La Boheme in Paris on my 21st birthday and guess what? I knew that Mimi dies!  The ballet fans who go to see Swan Lake and the opera fans who watch the Ring Cycle know the story! I have personally seen ""The Matrix"" six times, and I have read the Lord of the Rings at least 10 times, and seen the movies (2 of the 3) at least 4 times.  I have read War and Peace, (only once), even though I knew that Napoleon would lose.  My wife has read Gone with the Wind three times, and cries through the last 100 pages every time.  Art is art is art; and that is enough.
We are not crazy: we immerse ourselves in the art we love, to celebrate the triumph of the human spirit, be it Literature, Film, Painting, Opera, Poetry, Ballet, Dance, Jazz, whatever.
So critics, please take a break and get manipulated once in a while.  In these days of sterotyped TV soap opera and billion dollar professional sports (who cares?), lay back in your sofa with a beer or a glass of wine with someone you love, and let Billy Elliot wash over you.
If you like it, you can buy it on video for less than the price of a book, and add it to your collection.  And if you don't like it, so what?  It is life, it is art, it is thought provoking; go to Blockbuster and try again.",1052956800,3,2510,4.470459518599562

1278961,5,B00003CXPD,"Set during Northern England's miners' strike of 1984, Billy Elliot is a heart-warming, inspiring story about an eleven-year-old boy from a poor working-class family who aspires, despite the odds, to be a ballet dancer.  Billy, however, lives with his elder brother and his father, both of whom are striking miners and neither of whom can abide let alone comprehend Billy's desire to take ballet lessons.  It simply isn't done.  It's not for a lad, and that's that.
Billy struggles to follow both his heart and his innate talent in order to break free from a less-than-ideal (and at times even violent) home life and the prospects of a bleak future.  As a result, walls, cages, barriers and other images of entrapment figure prominently in the film, underscoring his predicament, and his dancing (by which means he struggles to break free) is powerfully juxtaposed with scenes of the violence, rage, and hatred in the community at the time.
The Special Edition of the video contains a 20 minute blurb (after the closing credits) with the show's stars, producers, and director talking about the film, the characters, and the situation in England at the time, all of which is interspersed with brief clips from the film.
The film is a 2000 BBC co-production with a running time of 111 minutes.  Apart from a superb storyline that is powerfully portrayed, the acting is absolutely first rate by all involved.  The Northumberland accents may be a little difficult at first for some, but it's nothing that can't be overcome with close attention, and it's well worth the effort.
In short, I'd highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a moving and inspiring yet rough-around-the-edges story of a lad intent upon breaking free and following his dreams in spite of the odds.  This is not some slick but gooey, maudlin Hollywood-style production, and in my opinion it's all the better for it.  The production is extremely well done--all the more so for being done in a manner so sensitive to the subject matter and the setting.",1037664000,11,2024,4.89766081871345

This film evokes so much emotion that it is difficult to pinpoint exactly what makes it so great. Billy was in him this great means of expression. Even before he learns to dance, he has a rhythm to the way he moves. And one day, he finds that he can dance, and has great potiental. However, the world he lives in does not allow boys to dance. Billy knows that *this* is what he is supposed to do, what he was made to do, what he needs to do, but there are so many things in his way that it seems impossible.

Billy Elliot, a young talented boy, has the love in ballet, although couldn't obtain his father's support but he still keeps the faith. This is something in the reality people used to lack of. We have a goal, but confront with obstacles, and we give it up. I really learned a lot from Billy Elliot.
In addition, Billy's father although seems to be a callous man, but in fact we can eventually know that he loves his little boy so deeply, that he's willing to do any sacrifice to give Billy the opportunity.
And the teacher, Julie Walters, does her job so well, keen to give Billy a good training, meanwhile can also listen to Billy's heart, give Billy not only ballet skills, but also a tender and warm care.

Does the perfect movie exist? Billy Elliot must come very close. From its brilliant casting, to clever cinematography to ... foot stomping choreography, this movie has got it all. The freshness and originality of Billy Elliot almost jumps off the screen. The British production house, Working Title Films over the last five years or so have had some great hits: Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, Bridget Jones' Diary, Elizabeth and in late 2000 we got Billy Elliot. They take great risks by using untried scriptwriters, directors and young actors and somehow have produced a string of fabulous movies.
The plot of Billy Elliot is simple enough; a North Country lad from a coal mining family discovers the joys of dance. Against opposition from his father and elder brother, young Billy discovers himself and his talents. All this happens within the vortex of Margaret Thatcher's mid-1980's economic and social revolution, which swirls around them.
At first glance, you might be tempted to classify Billy Elliot into the well-trodden school of gritty, British social realism, best expressed by Ken Loach of Cathy Come Home fame. Although mostly set in a working class world, the direction and camera work captures scenes of outstanding beauty. Cranes and bridges move like graceful, colourful birds; a kitchen table containing just two sauce bottles and duck-egg blue salt and pepper shakers has the aesthetics of an Old Master's still life.
The film's Director of Photography, Brian Tufano, has been quoted as saying, ""... framing, composition, colours and texture are the elements you need to convey a story."" Some scenes captured by Tufano's camera are nothing short of magical. We have Billy and his girlfriend Debbie walking past a wall of riot-shielded policemen. She nonchalantly rattles a stick along the shields and then she passes behind a parked police van. The van moves off and Debbie has disappeared. Has she been beamed up or abducted?
Billy's elder brother, Tony, a hotheaded union agitator, is chased along the streets near the Elliot family's terrace house. The lanes are full of virginal white, bedsheets hanging out to dry. Tony gets caught up in these as the police lay into him with their truncheons. We have the understatement of only seeing his blood seeping through the shroud-like sheets. If this movie were out of today's Hollywood, it would have been full-on gore. Despite the drama and action in this scene, it has an almost comic touch, with the soundtrack giving us The Clash doing London Calling. The chase through the streets and houses could come straight from a Max Sennet Keystone Cops movie from the 1920s.
In the reconciliation scene between Billy and his Dad, we see the two of them perched on a fence. A cemetery - where Billy's Mum lies buried - is in the foreground. Behind the fence is a field of golden ripe corn and on the skyline there are the sinister looking headframes of the coal mines. When we see the two of them wrestling and laughing in the cornfield, we are reminded that truly emotionally moving scenes in movies are possible without relying on Hollywood's formulaic schmaltz.
The blending of classical and contemporary music throughout the movie, both as a setting for the dance routines and as background music is natural and seamless. The climactic final scene, which is set 14 years later, has Billy debuting in a starring role in the Royal Ballet's Swan Lake. The build-up and tension from Tchaikovsky's music takes us to that transcending moment where Billy launches himself into a grand jete, where he seems to float in space.
Billy Elliot is a film that appeals at many levels, but the best recommendation is to just sit back and enjoy one of the best movies you will see in a long time.
As a footnote, it's worth seeing the DVD version of the movie since the subtitles will really help you get the most from the subtle nuances in the thickly accented dialogue.",1028246400,6,3935,4.90990990990991

1279027,5,B00003CXPD,"Jamie Bell is pure magic in this wonderful coming-0f-age film that tells the story of a working class English lad who takes up ballet as a way to hone his boxing skills.  In the process, he discovers himself, learnes some valuable life lessons, and fills a deep void left by the death of his beloved mum.  Despite his family's strong objections (and financial straits) Billy ends up studying dance from a local teacher (the effervescent Julie Walters, who won an Oscar nomination for her work here).  Her lessons - both technical and moral - serve as the basis for a devastatingly real connection between Billy and his disgusted macho father.  What ensues is a dramatic comedy that inspires us at every turn without condescension or pity.  The heartening interaction that develops between father and son is truly evocative, especially so for anyone who ever followed (or didn't) their dreams despite their family's objections.  Not only does Billy ""Dance!!"" for his supper...he befriends the local outcast gay teenager and copes with questions about his own sexual orientation - heady topics for a movie about a dancing teen.  All of this is handled in a mature, thoughtful manner, which makes the film a visceral, haunting experience.  You can take or leave it's many messages, but theere is no denying its emotional core.
It's rare for a movie to challenge social mores and values by focusing on the dominant male principals.  But ""Billy Elliot"" succeeds on more levels than other underdog-come-from-behind flicks.  First, its based on a true story and resonates with truth, integrity and spirit.  And, Bell's brash, authentic portrayal is pure magic.  His feet literally take over his soul...he dances in the street, mimmicking Gene Kelly, and in the process taps his way into your heart.  The performance is so accomplished it's a wonder Bell didn't receive an Oscar nomination.  Even Russell Crowe - who won the 2000 BAFTA and Oscar for ""Gladiator"" - admitted Bell deserved the BAFTA Prize instead.  Having resisted ""Billy Elliot"" at the movies, I finally caught it recently on HBO and was taken in immediately.  This is a film your entire family can and should enjoy...if they don't, perhaps a little side trip to an English coal-mining town will help them appreciate this wonderful heartwarming film.  Seriously, in this day and age, every one of us could use more Billy Elliots and fewer Scorpion Kings.  A keeper!",1019779200,64,2422,4.997506234413965
1279028,5,B00003CXPD,"I first saw this picture at the cinemas when first released and was crying at the end.  I saw so much of myself as an artist and identified completely with Billy.  I think we all have personal struggles, especially in youth, and Billy gives us hope that we can win.  This picture is one of my favourites and I must have it for my collection.  The sound track is fabulous and probably worth owning on it's own for T-Rex and Stephen Gately.
The symbolism is simply brilliant.  I hope everyone notices the swans on the wallpaper during the feather pillow fight scene.  This ties in with the whole theme of wings, feathers, flying to freedom, and ""Swan Lake"", with a genius interpretation of the ugly-duckling-to-swan metamorphosis that Billy makes, only he is quite cute.  The story is all about overcoming the unrecognised oppression that males face straight or gay.  There is also a sense of anger/fear changing to cathartic tenderness between men and it's about time we have more of this in pictures.  Men's liberation has only begun.
I would recommend this picture for everyone young or old, fed up to the back teeth with the constrictions of antiquated thinking, and seeking great entertainment.

This movie has a similar background of mining communities and strikes, but the ""odd man out"" is even more out of step with everyone else: a boy who prefers ballet to boxing, and his friend who wears his sister's dresses when she's out. I enjoyed this movie enough to buy the DVD. Several scenes stick in my memory: a pillow fight between Billy and his ballet teacher's daughter, full of pubescent sexual tension; and Billy's dad, turned ""scab"" to pay for Billy's ballet career, riding the police-guarded bus through the picket lines; and Billy and his teacher dancing in the gym.
The tension in Billy himself between his environment's ""boys don't do ballet"" attitudes and his own love of dancing is nicely played out. I felt everyone came around to a supportive position a little too easily and predictably, like, ""Come on, there's only a 30 minutes of this movie left, so we better gather round and drop all the negativity"", but that may be a comment on the editing rather than the acting or direction. The colours and photography were great, tho the winter scenes were so completely unconvincing it was funny! And Jamie Bell himself is brilliant - his acting even more than his dancing. This is an interesting story, about the difficulty of growing up without a mother, about breaking social and sexual expectations; it is NOT a movie about miners or politics.

I've seen this film twice and I find something new in it each time, whether it is the stirring scenes with Billy as he struggles for acceptance or the impassioned hatred of those returning to work in what are extremely realistic scenes from the Miners' Strike.
Brought up by his father in the harsh back streets of County Durham during the strikes, Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell) is actively encouraged to participate in boxing by his father yet he discovers a new talent ..for ballet. Short of asking outright to be ostracised, Billy fervently pursues his passion with Julie Andrews as his practical and emotional mentor before his father and brother discover what is going on, bringing about a scene of evocative anger, frustration and stubbornness. After applying for trials at the London Ballet School, Billy demonstrates his routine for his friend Michael, the teenager struggling to deal with his homosexuality, but his father walks in on him and is forced to confront his morals, dreams and principles.

1279132,5,B00003CXPD,"To me, there are differences between a 'feel good' movie and one that makes you feel good. The phrase 'feel good' implies something shallow, something that touches your emotions in a superficial and often hollow way. You get a little lump in your throat or a smile on your face, but you don't feel anything particularly powerful. But a movie that has the ability to make you feel good is a rare event, and the best ones can connect you with that elusive thing, the human spirit. Billy Elliot is such a movie.
Billy Elliot is a twelve year old kid in northern England in 1984 who seems destined for an ordinary life. His dad and his older brother are coal miners, and in the rather dreary town he lives in, it is quietly assumed that Billy will join them one day. Billy is taking a boxing class. One afternoon his instructor asks him to give some keys to Mrs. Wilkerson [Julie Walters], who teaches a ballet class in the same building. She is in no hurry for the keys, so Billy has time to observe the lesson. Something about dancing intrigues Billy, and soon he is secretly attending the classes. Wilkerson is delighted because Billy is easily the most talented pupil she has ever had. It is only a matter of time before Billy is caught by his father and brother, but he is almost mystically drawn to ballet. When he is finally discovered, there is hell to pay. His family is already suffering from the effects of the worst coal miners' strike in British history, and Billy's participation in what they perceive to be an effeminate pursuit just adds to their woes. Billy must now learn how hard it is to follow your heart when it is pulling in two different directions.
Jamie Bell is remarkable as Billy. He is the most talented young actor I have seen in years. His command of the role is the more remarkable because this is his first acting assignment. Like his character, he also is from northern England and took dance classes without his friends knowing.
The always excellent Julie Walters plays Mrs. Wilkerson as a disillusioned but kind woman who chain smokes while she teaches and who sees in Billy the talent she never had. She also acts as a mother figure to the boy, who recently lost his own Mom. As Billy's dad, Gary Lewis gives us a man who is hard as nails on the outside but thoughtful on the inside. Beyond his blustering, he sees in Billy's dancing an opportunity he never had, but he resists because ballet is so alien to his world.
Billy Elliot is one of the most positive, thoughtful and finely crafted movies I have seen recently. It should prove endearing to all the countless people who have found that they are different from the people around them and who have struggled between trying to fit in and following their true destiny.
NOTE: The characters in this movie speak in a British dialect which may be unfamiliar to many viewers. It will be well worth the effort of backing up the DVD a bit in order to catch words and phrases you might have trouble understanding.
Rated R for language. The MPAA is going to have to conclude that a certain word beginning with 'f' has been heard a thousand times already by teenagers or else movie makers are going to have to sacrifice that word. I mention this because said word is the one and only reason this film was rated R. It is a perfect film for many teens in my opinion.",1016236800,5,3342,4.471358428805237

Once the father realizes that his son has the passion for dance and a lot of talent for it, he becomes a real father who knows he must go beyond his own selfishness and put the needs/wants of his child first.  Once he starts supporting Billy's passion, the brother too realizes that he cannot deny his brother a life different than his own.
This is truly a family film showing what real parental and family love is all about.  Its a very excellent ""feel good"" film that you will watch over and over until your DVD can't take it anymore.

1279137,4,B00003CXPD,"Billy Elliot is the story of an 11-year-old boy (Jamie Bell) brought up in a tough working class environment who attends boxing classes at the behest of his tough mining father (Gary Lewis). Unfortunately for Billy however, not only does he has to wear his grandfathers antique boxing gloves but he has no boxing talent whatsoever. Somewhat reluctantly (and secretly from his father) he is drawn into participating in the local ballet classes that take place in the same village hall. There he is taken under the wing of the teacher, Mrs Wilkinson, played by Julie Walters (Educating Rita) who soon realises that his flourishing talent may just be his ticket out of the poverty and deprivation that surround them. However, this is to the horror of his father, for not only is this dancing, it's not even the masculine dance of Gene Kelly. It is ballet, as his father would have it, only for girls and nancy boys.
Set in the north east of England during the British miners strike of 1984-5 Director Stephen Daldry perfectly captures the darkest period of British social history and the poverty suffering and devastation that it brought to so many communities in this extremely heartwarming and uplifting movie. The miners strike was the period in Britain's history when Margaret Thatcher (the Iron Lady as she became known) literally starved the coal miners, who were striking to save their jobs and the pits from closing. It literally turned neighbours against one another, brought enormous economic hardship to families and destroyed communities. And when it was all over they closed all the pits anyway and all hope was stolen from the working classes, perhaps never to be restored again.
Billy Elliot is a very good movie but I have one objection with it and all the other `gritty' British movies and that is the way the working classes are always portrayed. On the basis of Brassed Off, The Full Monty, Little Voice etc., Americans must really pity us poor British in our squalid terraced council houses and working men's clubs, cigarette permanently in one hand, beer permanently in the other, with our conversations littered with obscenities, even when speaking to kids. The reality is somewhat different and it worries me that a stereotype may begin to develop here. I, and all of my friends come from a working class background and many of the people I knew at school had fathers working in the mines. However, none of them came from a family where obscenities, cigarettes and alcohol were the norm. Certainly there is an element of society that lives like that but from my experience they tend to be the never worked, never want to work lowest of the low, who would never fight to keep a job or bring up a family. (Excuse me whilst I get off my soap box)!
 Ultimately however, this is a film with a lot of charm, a lot of humour, a lot of heart and great acting performances all round (but particularly from Gary Lewis, Julie Walters and the excellent newcomer Jamie Bell as the title character). The movie is full of fine moments including Billy and his teacher performing a powerhouse dance routine to I Love to Boogie by T Rex, or when Mrs Wilkinson's daughter Debbie idly bangs a stick along the row of policemen's perspex riot shields, whilst sauntering down the street and Billy's dance of rage when his father forbids him from dancing again.
Stephen Daldry's direction and the screenplay by Lee Hall are both excellent and it is to their credit that they deal with the question of Billy's nascent sexuality, avoiding vulgarity and judgement. Billy Elliot is not a stereotypical male ballet dancer but the question of his sexuality is left open to question and to their credit the filmmakers have avoided the obvious temptation to reassure the audience that the young boy is straight, because it is irrelevant to the triumph against the odds story. Slightly confusing however, is the use of T rex throughout the soundtrack and other obvious references to the seventies, such as the sight of a Spacehopper and the game Ker-Plunk. 1984/5 was more the time of Wham, Frankie Goes To Hollywood and Duran Duran and the Spacehopper and fallen from fashion some ten years earlier (although now making a return apparently). However, any criticisms are mere details for Billy Elliot is that annual rarity, a really good British movie, that both inspires and entertains in equal volumes. Highly recommended!",1012867200,7,4411,4.850132625994695
1279138,4,B00003CXPD,"I found this movie to be uplifting in almost all senses of the word. The performances are outstanding, particularly from Julie Walters (but then, what else would you expect from her?). There were two things in the movie that made me rate it 4 Stars rather than 5: 1) Why wasn't Julie Walters in the final scene? I felt that I needed that sense of closure and 2) While the scene in which the father returns to the mines to work and the strikers are going crazy screaming & taunting the scabs, was indeed shocking & disturbing in its realism, I did not understand one thing. Why, if there were hundreds of policeman protecting the returning workers, was it so very easy for the son to get to the father, once he was inside the compound, to confront him about returning to work? If it were so easy for any of the strikers to reach the main compound area, then why had they not done so before to get to the workers who refused to strike? Why were there not policeman protecting the workers there as well?
But, those two points aside, I have watched & enjoyed this movie repeatedly due to its sincerity, levity, and uplifting quality.",1010534400,,1129,4.4326923076923075
1279139,5,B00003CXPD,"Billy Elliot still shakes me after all these days like a bundle of lit scent - whenever I go near, I am struck by the religious smell and felt the sentiment deep down. It still wets my eyes when I portrait the father's shivering lips when he sat in the ballet theatre watching on the stage and the very son of his, flied out from the side a beautiful swan, high in the air, wildly expressive and immensely powerful. Who wouldn't shiver and been stunned by the astonishing moment of love? I remember it was the boyish call out from the top of a short wall in the small town of miners and simple cascaded houses, `Ouy, dancing boy!', that the first streams of tears came down my cheek, unbearably. It's been an inevitable opening of a full blown reservoir. My flooded heart started to pound as it would like, the fullest, with the rhythm of each pulling of its nerves by nothing but love. The moment the two big iron men lightly fought over the right to carry the suitcase of the baby kid's, on the down slope towards the bus stop seemed so lean yet touching, forcing one to feel the uncontrollable passion of love heated through the cold surface of those dark jackets and stubbornly sticking dark hair. It really doesn't need a big budget and big stars to make a movie shine. Billy Elliot once again proved this convincingly. The whole movie was tense without any dull moments, touching without any artificial tear forcing effort and long lasting like nothing of the Hollywood momentary big stuns. It expresses passion and love, like many of the other movies try to capture, with its unique and tender caress, over the most realistic people and their simple lives. My heart goes to Billy Elliot, the boy, the family, the movie and its most invincible passion and love, of all.",1010448000,4,1775,4.55

Jamie Bell is an unrefined gem, raw and energetic in the title role, and this film's exploration of gender roles is handled with exquisite taste and sensitivity, gently mocking stereotypes but also offering touching examples of courage and grace from unexpected sources.
My only major criticism would be the film's epilogue.  Tacked on, perhaps, to give a sense of ""closure"" (complete with all-grown-up versions of several lead characters), this section felt wholly unnecessary, and definitely coloured my perception of the film as a whole.

1279211,4,B00003CXPD,"Billy Elliot is a wonderfully written movie.  The acting is above average, although not spectacular.  I was most pleased with the way the movie would have subplots that seemed not to fit with the movie (such as the miner's strike), but they would be wonderfully interwoven into the movie in a way that was thought provoking.
However, I was somewhat dissapointed with the movie's handling of the homosexual issue.  While the point of the movie was that not all boys that are interested in dance, etc. are homosexuals, the movie gives the impression that all male homosexuals are interested in dance, etc.-- which I don't think to be true.  However, that aside, the movie deals with the issue of young boys and their emotions very well.  It shows that there is nothing wrong with emotionally expressive boys.  I was also impressed with the way the writer handled the family situation- the interactions between Billy, his father, his brother, and his grandmother were intense and meaningful.
Overall, a movie worth seeing for anybody interested in child psychology.  Also a good discussion starter for families... teenage and above.
As a note, since this is a British film, the accents may take awhile to get used to (for Americans), but it is not very difficult to keep up.",1008547200,2,1271,4.883720930232558
1279212,4,B00003CXPD,"The film does not give adequate time to develop Billy's growing interest in music, especially dance (ballet) -- apart from a few scenes (i.e. improvising a tune on the piano).  This lack of preparation makes the viewer question whether Billy's interest in ballet is genuine or whether it is an act of rebellion against his coal-miner father.  It is only in the latter half of the film is it made clear that his interests are genuine.  Apart from this one quibble, the film is very well made, capturing the feel of the labor disputes of the 80's in the UK.
Jamie Bell who plays Billy Eliot should be nominated for an Academy award for Best Actor.",1007596800,2,645,4.543103448275862
1279213,5,B00003CXPD,"I found ""Billy Elliot"" in a local video store, and really only got it because it was used, and cheap.  Took it home, didn't know what to expect. I found it was a treasure and a few days later, bought the DVD.
From the title sequence I knew something was up, they weren't ordinary, a kid bouncing up and down through the screen. Then moving into the first ""real"" scene I watched closer, the film drew me in, I couldn't stop watching.
Right off, the viewer finds great character development, with 11-year-old Billy at home caring after of his aged ""Grama"" and then more, with his dad and older brother heading off to the miner's picket line in their small Northern England town. His newly deceased mom appears there at home in family photos on the piano top.
Next scene, Billy is drawn into a girl's ballet class that just happens to meet where he's taking boxing lessons. That's where we meet the rest of the main characters, his school-mate Michael, his dance teacher, Mrs wilkinson and her daughter, Debbie.
The expected conflicts arise as Billy pursues his passion for dancing. Family, culture, economics, and just plain ol' growin' up come into the fray. Billy's resolve and guts drive him through to his goal of being a ballet dancer. The happy ending is expected, but getting there is what's unexpected.
This film has greatly directed scenes that are composed like a master painter. Scenes move artistically from one to the next. Watch for the blend from the Fred Astaire movie clip moving right on screen to the scene with Grama and him as they go to visit Billy's mom's grave. Later, watch for the slight turn of his father's head as he sits on Billy's bed moving to the next scene as dad decides to be a ""scab"", going back to the mine for Billy's sake. I think ""little"" stuff like that makes for a great movie.
The story is well written. The acting is dramatic and believable.
The music is worth getting the soundtrack. The dancing scenes are just great, from the initial stumbling about with Mrs. Wilkinson, to serious artistry when Billy auditions at the Royal Ballet School. Jamie Bell as Billy is a kid you cannot help but to root for in this movie and in the future as well. He's a talent that I pray no one exploits, I think you'll want to wish the best for him.
I missed it at the theatre but found ""Billy Elliot"", a real treasure, buried at my local video store. And then later, with the added features on DVD.",1007337600,4,2426,4.513636363636364
1279214,4,B00003CXPD,"The plot of this movie is a mixture of THE FULL MONTY and FLASHDANCE, set against much the same North-of-England, working-class background as KES.  There is very little that struck me as truly original, although I enjoyed the scene when Billy's elder brother is chased by police about the mining town and he simply knows that every front and back door is going to be unlocked.
The choice of music for the soundtrack was bizarre -- early 70s T Rex (largely) for an early 80s movie?  But, given that most of the music of the 1980s was so dire, the choice of a deceased composer like Marc Bolan enabled the producers to get legal permission before they started filming (unlike THE BIG CHILL, for instance, where the actors are required to dance in the kitchen with no idea what tune will finally be overlaid on the soundtrack).
There are one or two very touching scenes -- such as Billy showing his ballet teacher the letter from his dead mother -- and you know you've been set up for them, but they're endearing nonetheless.  I couldn't understand why Billy's Dad had such a strong Scottish accent when everyone else in the family and community spoke with the lilt of North-East England.
Overall, not a great film from the production companies of Richard Curtis and Rowan Atkinson (Working Title / Tiger Aspect), but not a bad one.  The theme is one that I'd like to show to my children, but because of the swearing, this movie is rated 15 in the UK, which meant that the actor who played Billy was unable to  see it.",1007251200,,1515,4.534798534798535
1279215,5,B00003CXPD,"I had only two problems with the movie---
(1) Why didn't they just make the kid 13 (his real age) or at least 12-- it was very difficult to believe he was just 11 as the story puts it-- at least not here in the U.S.  ??
(2) In real life, Northeastern England, mid-1980s... could people not even say ""Pass the butter"" without saying, ""Pass the
----ing butter!""  ??  I fully accept that kids use 4-letter words until they wear them out or get bored with them, but wasn't this just a tad overdone in ""Billy""-- especially for the adults???
I think what struck me most was the *reminders* of elements in other movies-- for example:
*Kid yells at parent to stop beating sibling. (""A Home of Our Own"")
*One last lingering look at the old homeplace. (""Grapes of Wrath"")
*Father finally accepting his son being different. (""October Sky"")
*The eternal struggle of labor against big business. (""How Green Was My Valley"")
*One boy accepting the *affections* of another, even
  though he really doesn't understand them. (""This Boy's Life"")
*Boy being sent out into the world (by his ballet teacher) to
learn about life. (""Pelle the Conqueror"")
If you have watched ""Billy"", I am sure you can think of other examples.
I LOVED the accents, but had to watch the movie a second time with captions for the deaf enabled-- to know what the heck they were saying in many spots.
I wish I knew what kind of success this movie had here in Texas-- my guess is that our pistol-packin',  football hero dads would say, ""Well, okay for him I guess-- just don't let it ever happen to MY boy!""
Interesting that they auditioned 2,000 kids (and almost gave up) before they found a kid who could act AND dance.  Jamie Bell was fantastic as Billy.
Many very touching moments in the film-- the boy trying to clean the spray paint from his mom's grave marker;  the grandmother being left behind;  the father willing to be a *scab* to earn money for his son's trip;  the miners having to go back to a job at the same or even less salary (been there, done that, bought the t-shirt-- it is a lousy feeling!)  Those are just a few examples.
The extra DVD material was very interesting and helpful! This one richly deserved all the praise it received--

1279216,2,B00003CXPD,"Billy Elliott (Stephen Daldry, 2000)

The surprise hit of 2000, and I can't for the life of me figure out why. Daldry throws scene after scene of unmitigated emotional manipulation at us without ever really bothering to connect them. Plotlines begin and disappear (mostly to accentuate points of character; it's easier and more effective to do so without introducing subplots you don't plan to do anything with), characters are developed and then never realized, ambiguity reigns in areas where definition cries out for exposure, and the soundtrack is a horrid mishmash of songs that may have been appropriate where they were, had the movie's subject matter been about the same things as the songs were (most notably The Clash's ""London Calling,"" which lent a great deal of weight to what was, at best, a minor scene).

As with Cast Away (ONE word, not two...), a director took a fine cast of characters and refused to let them come through. The most heartbreaking example of this is Debbie (Nicola Wilson in her screen debut), the daughter of Billy's dance teacher and a possible love interest-- until she disappears from the movie without any explanation.

*** Billy Elliot is an 11-year-old boy who secretly ditches his boxing lessons for ballet class. His father and older brother are both participants in a bitter miner's strike gripping their town in northeastern England.  The whole family is also still in recovery-mode following the death of Billy's mother.
*** Billy's exuberance and talent (and actor Jamie Bell's) are such a joy to behold.  It makes it all the more poignant when he has to face his dad and brother's discovery of his dancing (as the audience knows they must).

Billy truly shows that you must really really try to do what you love, even if it looks like you may not make it.  He grabs on to his talent and lets him take him amazing places.
You know you're watching a true British film when 1) There's a miners' strink involved and 2) when you have to put on the subtitles to understand you're own language because the  northern accents are so thick that you can't understand them as well without them.

Set in a coal-mining town in Northern England during a miner's strike, it is the story of a boy (brilliantly played by Jamie Bell) whose natural talent for dance unfairly characterizes him as gay.  But his persistence wins over not only his family, but the striking miners, as well.
The ""R"" rating is unfortunate and (in my opinion) unwarranted, and is most likely for the frequent use of the ""F-word.""  But the language is realistic and not offensive (and not used in a sexual context), and I had no problems showing it to a Senior High Church youth group.

The film's so formulatic that it's really sad. There are a few early scenes that show Billy's discovery of ballet that really are something special, but even these are cross cut with shots showing the police quelling a worker's rebellion. The biggest problem with the film is that Billy is meant to stand for more than he is. He's filling in as hope for an entire community here. His dad & brother are resigned to being coal workers. His teacher has a failed marriage & teaches for 50 pence a lesson. His gay friend feels stifled by his homosexuality and sees Billy as the only one who understands him. His grandmother had hopes of being a pro dancer, but never got the training. Taken one by one these subplots are fine, but the accumulation of them all makes the film feel so forced that it really hurts the overall impact of Billy's dancing glories. The film achieves its successes in the small moments of personal discovery; the rest seems unnecessary.

The scenes simply work much better alone than in the framework of the picture where they all combine to form mush despite the fact that there is little mush contained in them individually. There's a good supporting performance by Julie Waters. The rest of the cast is fine if unexceptional. It's hardly an awful film, and I realize there is talent present, butI just with it wasn't all so damn manipulative.",1000080000,2,1502,4.6254681647940075

Instead of boxing out lad is drawn to the other side of the hall where some girls are practicing ballet. He heads over and starts to take lessons. He knows that his dad will not approve so that he tells no one. The young lad has a bit of a talent and impresses his teacher Julie Walters from Educating Rita.

1279410,5,B00003CXPD,"I was prepared to love this film when I read the descriptions, and with one minor exception, my wish was fulfilled.  This is a compelling story of a young boy's courage to pursue his dream, despite its being completely antithetical to the cultural expectations of the town in which he lived.  In a mining town, where men are men, Billy (Jamie Bell) slips away each night after boxing practice to learn ballet with the girls.  In spite of enormous social pressure and a disapproving father, Billy persists in his dream to become a ballet dancer and emerges triumphant.
This is a story that is less about dance than it is about social interaction.  The incredible pressure to be what one is expected to be is pitted elegantly against the unyielding desire to pursue one's ambitions.  Also woven into the story are various themes about people who are different and how they handle being on the fringe.  The film does an excellent job of developing various characters and making us love them, foibles and all.
My only reservation is that the film overemphasized certain of the human stories (particularly the minors' strike) at the expense of the dance.  We see glimpses of Billy's progress as a dancer, but he seems to explode from spastic and gawky to an accomplished tap artist with little transition.  Also, there seems to be a disconnect between his exceptional tap skills and his tentative ballet skills, which is so discrepant that it is hard to believe it is the same dancer.  While the dance theme is clearly subordinate to the human issues, I felt it should have been more believable and better developed to complete the film.
Not much more could have been asked of Jamie Bell in this role.  In his film debut he is mesmerizing, both in his acting and dance performances.  Bell always found exactly the right emotion to portray Billy's conflicts, disappointments and stubborn persistence.  Bell is the keystone that holds the entire film together and he is the reason it succeeds so completely.
The ensemble supporting Bell is also first rate as is the direction of Stephen Daldry.  Daldry gives the story that quaint small town British feel, full of brutal honesty and simple human truths.  Daldry's greatest success is in the pure sincerity of the actors' performances making every frame realistic and convincing, and earning him an Oscar nomination for best director in only his second film.  Julie Walters, also nominated for best supporting actress, does a fine job as the tough and determined ballet teacher, and Gary Lewis gives a standout performance as Billy's dad.
This is an inspirational film that is just a hair short of perfect.  I rated it a 9/10.  With a little better development of the dance theme it might have been flawless.  Nonetheless, it is one of the most compelling and uplifting films of the year with a positive and upbeat message that is sure to capture your heart.",998438400,3,2900,4.824242424242424
1279411,1,B00003CXPD,"One does try as hard as one can to avoid the working classes, although poverty and lack of transport make this problematic.  If curiosity about how they actually live their lives gets the better of one then what safer way than home video?  My last such glimpse into a strange and unfamiliar world was through Ken Loach's 'Kes', in which a frustrated and alienated young boy, cowed by an aggressive brother and the uncertainty of a benighted future down the pits, discovers that his best friend is a Kestrel.  Quickly crushing any aesthesia brought on by Loach's compassion for the great unwashed, it has taken the hyperbol surrounding 'Billy Elliot' to take me less than expeditiously down memory lane once more.  How have the lives of the working classes changed thirty years on?  Apparently they sleep two to a bedroom instead of six as I had once erroneously supposed and have inside toilets.  When a solitary worker has the temerity to want to do a day's work he is chased through a succession of working class dwellings by fifty riot police in full regalia until caught.  It's gratifying to see such a realistic prioritizing of police resources on film and the comforting knowledge of the tax payer's money well spent.  Apart from that, little has changed except for one egrigious detail.  Your actual working classes pirouette down the high street. Billy Elliot, a frustrated and alienated young boy cowed by an aggressive brother and the uncertainty of a benighted future down the pits, discovers that his best friend is a ballet tutu.  Also, his second best friend just might be a transvestite.  This irresponsibility on the part of the British film industry should not go unanswered.  This is not Hampstead.  Encouraging the lower orders to experience culture only leads to books, and books lead to union membership and then (God help us) secret ballots. I think the need to appeal to the American market has reared it's capitulant head here.  Pleas for sexual tolerance and finding your inner child are more important than a roof over one's head and the dignity of (hard) labour.  Kestrels are aggressive, macho symbols that may lower the tone and pull a boy's false eye lashes off.  Of course, we must take all these changes on trust, but how accurate is this to real working class lives?  Unlike the ending to 'Kes' which leaves the audience basking in the warm glow of their own undoubtedly justified prejudices, 'Billy Elliot' leaves us suspicious and distrustful at it's challenge to the natural order.  Yes, we may let the odd one escape to become rock musicians, sportsman and soap stars, but let us not get carried away.  This is an American fortune cookie, not OUR Britain, thank you very much.
Now, one may be prepared to sit through working class life when the film making calibre of Ken Loach is involved, but when confronted by the almost obdurately dire artistic decisions and cack direction of Stephen Daldry, the urge to hit the off switch is overwhelming.  There are, no doubt, worse experiences one might be subjected to in one's drawing room than 'Billy Elliot' such as listening to pibroch while having your leg chewed off by a shark, but it's a close run thing.  It may be in the unlikely event prejudice (heaven forbid), but I thought this film was quite staggeringly, fall off Ben Nevis bad.  It's jocund liveliness cannot hide it's jejunity (and trying saying that fast, I guarantee it will be more comprehensible than 'Billy Elliot'). And if I have to endure one more scene in which a minor turns to another minor (as opposed to a miner) and after a long pause says ""do you want to play hide the salami with me"" or words to that effect, I shall emigrate to Botswana and I don't even know where that is.  Do contemporary writers think this is cute and cuddly coming from children, as opposed to deeply creepy put in their mouths by an adult?  May I suggest that in an act of charity not dissimilar to their salt of the earth goodness depicted in 'Billy Elliot', our actual working classes band together to confer on the writer Mr Hall, the useful and life changing gift of an escritoire?",998438400,7,4121,4.731468531468532
1279412,5,B00003CXPD,"There is little I can add to the praise already given to this film in the previous reviews. This is an excellent film which is moving without being sentimental and truly uplifting. The acting is superb - worthy of oscars but obviously not within the privileged circle that could get them.
What has inspired me to write a review is not really to provide further acclaim but because of the many comments criticising the film because of the 'thick' British accents or because of the language.
Firstly, the accents are County Durham accents NOT ""British"" (compare with the Queen if you really can't see the difference). What do you expect? Should a film set in a working class mining community in County Durham have actors speaking in BBC English or even American accents just to please the American market? Why is there this expectation that everything has to be homogenised to be acceptable? I personally have a lot of difficulty understanding the American accents in many of the films that we see (and we don't get subtitles!) but I do not complain because I assume that this is the way that people actually speak there? This is the way people actually speak in Durham and thus adds to the realism of the film.
Secondly there have been many complaints about the language - some saying it was unnecessary. Again, I am afraid this is the way that the people being portrayed speak and it would be unrealistic to censor the language. As one enlightened reviewer alluded, language is harmless - at least the film did not contain the gratuitous violence, gun culture and 'drugs as a way of life' themes that a vast number of American films do. Films with much more harmful content get away with lighter certifications - why? Why is there this prudish attitude towards language but a blind acceptance of the portrayal of the sickness of society. Maybe it's what you're used to?
This film portrays the things that are good about people. Their courage, their perseverance, their triumphs in the face of adversity, their love. What does a little bad language matter?
Get real America? - People do speak differently from you elsewhere you know and people also have values and qualities that rise above their vocabulary.",998352000,2,2207,4.780104712041885
1279413,2,B00003CXPD,"This film is, largely speaking, nothing more than a limpid piece of sh*t. Sorry, all you people who found it ""inspiring"" etc., but to me some of the scenes were so corny I could barely watch. The scene where Billy is afraid to answer the panel, then, upon leaving, he is asked ""How do you feel when you dance?"" I could feel it, I was thinking 'please don't do it Billy, don't launch into cheesy sentimental crap'. But his response was worse than I had imagined.  ""I feel free...like a bird...I can spread my wings and fly."" NO!! There is only so much tacky sentimentality you can take, (not much) and this film takes it much much too far. The sentiment may be all lovely and nice, but try to express it in a way which doesn't make me sink into my shoes with embarrassment. The reason I have given it 2 stars is that I thought the sub-plot (the miners' strike) was rather powerful and touching at times (Billy's dad in despair at the pit after crossing the picket line was genuinely moving) but this story was far too much in the background for me. Too much of the corny trash. Sorry. Not good. Watch the Shawshank Redemption for a truly inspiring tale of hope.",998265600,4,1160,4.37037037037037
1279414,5,B00003CXPD,"I almost didn't rent this DVD and I would have missed out on a very beautiful and touching movie. The character Billy Elliot is a young boy who is man enough to stand up for his passion. The setting is quite simple, county Durham and the characters are so well-written, well-acted. But the revelation is the young actor Jamie Bell. His portrayal of Billy was so touching and so natural. The most touching scene was when BIlly's father caught Billy and his young homosexual friend dancing; Billy was able to silently stand up to his father by dancing in an angry, rebellious manner that left not just his father, but myself, speechless. I couldn't help but cry and root for Billy all througout.

1279416,5,B00003CXPD,"I highly recommend this movie. The characters are believable, the story uplifting, the scenes artfully made, and the music irresistible. I love this movie so much I had to buy the movie soundtrack, the book (screenplay) itself by Lee Hall, and the video in VHS and DVD.
The story revolves around Billy Elliot, an 11-year-old, motherless boy, who secretly traded boxing lessons to pursue his dream of becoming a ballet dancer. His father and elder brother were opposed to this idea. They were miners on strike at that time. But with the guidance of a determined teacher played by Julia Walters (nominated for Oscar's best supporting actress in this film), Billy studied and practiced dancing after school and whenever he could find time, until he was ready to audition for the Royal Ballet School.
Billy's father and brother eventually realized they had to give the boy the chance for the audition. After raising enough money through the help a friend George, and by the father pawning the jewelry of his late wife, Billy finally would have his chance of a lifetime. Billy went for the audition with this dad. They went home unsure but eagerly awaiting its outcome.
The letter from the school came. The father, elder brother and grandmother sat anxiously, while Billy went to a room to open the letter. Billy passed the audition.
The mining strike was over. The father and brother went back to work. Years later, they were seen getting off the train to London, into a full-packed theater, where Billy was the dancing star on the stage.
This is a movie that will stay in my mind for a long time. It points out the fact that there's a special talent inside each one of us that's waiting to come out. Whatever that talent is, one only needs to be true to oneself.
Stephen Daldry's first-time feature film direction was excellent; the scenes move fast and every single one of them was effectively used to build up the story.  Lee Hall's screenplay was heartwarming, though it's hard to understand some of the words because the language and accent used are of the Northern British region. Peter Darling's choreography was impassioned. Jamie Bell who played Billy Elliot was engaging; he has a rare talent for acting and dancing.
One will hear countless use of the four-letter ""f"" word in the dialogue, which gained for itself the ""Restricted"" rating. I don't know if the director and writer should have tried to limit the use of this word so as to include the PG-13 audience. I don't know much about Northern British culture, particularly one of a working class family, to say whether this kind of language is appropriate or not.
Overall, Billy Elliot is a very good movie. To me it, it's one of the best films of all time.  I give it five stars.",996710400,,2740,4.718162839248434

Props to Stephen Daldry for making what could be a tedious, over-sentimental story into a fresh and emotional movie.  Instead of focusing on the obligatory sexual politics or high risk audition (both are in the movie, but they are actually dealt with intelligently), Daldry looks to the anger, frustration, and yearning for freedom that a young boy expresses through dance.  Jamie Bell is incredible as Billy, as is the rest of the cast.

1279468,4,B00003CXPD,"""Billy Elliot,"" one of 2000's best films, is far more than just the typical coming-of-age story.  It is a paean to all of us who have, at one time or another, felt ourselves to be ""different"" from society as a whole (and who among us, in moments of quiet honesty, would deny feeling this way at some time or other in our lives?).  ""Billy Elliot"" takes us back to that time in our lives - early adolescence - when we are just beginning to experience the manifold wonders of the world, when we are just beginning to explore those things which makes us feel good, and when we are just starting that long process of self-discovery that will ultimately define who we are and what we love.  Such a journey can be an easy one if, for instance, that thing that we choose to love happens to be socially acceptable - i.e. football for boys or cooking for girls - but what if it isn't?  What if, say, the focus of attention for a young boy growing up in a poor English mining town happens to be ballet dancing?  Then growing up and staying true to oneself suddenly become all that more challenging.  If for no other reason, ""Billy Elliot"" deserves credit for tackling and illuminating the tricky and sometimes uncomfortable subject of adolescent gender-bending.
Billy is an 11-year old boy whose life provides little opportunity for warmth or joy.  His father and brother are striking miners, his beloved mother has recently passed away and his maternal grandmother struggles with the disorientation that comes with advancing senility.  The one ray of light in Billy's otherwise drab, humorless life is his fascination with the ballet class that meets in the same gym where he is supposed to be receiving his boxing lessons.  One of the great joys of ""Billy Elliot"" comes in these early scenes as we see Billy going to enormous lengths to hide the truth of his activities, secreting his dancing shoes under his mattress or inside his trousers or absconding with a book on dancing from a local book mobile etc.  Who among us can fail to identify with this sense that, if others discovered what we REALLY loved, we would quickly become a pariah, a misfit, an outcast?  Haven't we all, at some time or other, secretly hidden objects that meant the world to us but that others just wouldn't understand if they saw we had them?  Well, ""Billy Elliot"" reminds us that it is okay to be different, that indeed pursuing our goal - whatever it is - is the single most important step to achieving personal happiness.
In terms of plotting, there is not really much that is new here.  The conflict-ridden lower class family, the recently dead mother, the feisty, sympathetic teacher who places all her faith in her young pupil, the initial reluctance on the part of the family and the community to accept Billy's dream and their ultimately yielding to his wishes - these are all elements we have seen in films before.  Yet, somehow, ""Billy Elliot"" never seems clichd or derivative, partly because writer Lee Hall and director Stephen Daldry get the details of character and setting so right and partly because Jamie Bell delivers such a luminous, naturalistic performance as Billy.  Thanks to Bell's subtle underplaying, Billy never comes across as precious or precocious.  He is just an ordinary kid with an extraordinary gift who is not afraid to ultimately stand up and defend his own originality.  As the ballet instructor, Julie Walters conveys just the right combination of firm determination and openhearted compassion to make her a believable inspiration to her young charge.  Gary Lewis, Jamie Draven and Jean Heywood are all excellent as Billy's father, brother and grandmother respectively.
The term ""feel good movie"" is often the kiss of death when it comes to encouraging the less sentimentally inclined among us to check out a film.  But ""Billy Elliot"" really is a movie that could serve a salutary purpose.  If it inspires even one parent to allow a child to fulfill his or her dream - regardless of what it happens to be - it may be one of those rare films that actually does some good in the world.  Not bad for a little independent charmer like this one.",995068800,4,4147,4.71606648199446

First of all, a solid acting of the lead of Billy Elliot and some good moves from father Eliot. The kid was able to behave mature, well trained, naturally in the whole line of acting to create a coherent character of a struggling boy, obsessed by the idea, weakened by not knowing what would be right, and still strong to allow us to feel it. Guess for that we have to thank the director, who really could mould the script in a living action, driving the audience to empathy. The story line is interesting and not banal. Actions do not flow by a one- track algorithm, there are hints, but it feels like a life. We know Billy will have to stand up to his father, but he does it in a difficult, comical and not transparent way.
I can perceive symbols, like the rusty metal fence, opposite to the alluring endless sea or the bridge and more. They just are, noticeable or hidden. Some redundant to my mind details are the homosexual line, or revolving of 11-years-olds around sex issues, which is probably a tribute to common thinking, because they are not really needed to open the characters. In overall, the director's feel of reality and proportion is what that make the film so well-paced. Almost no exaggerations, precise timing.
There is no sweet American-style `work-and-be-great' fanfarous finale, which feels fine, although audience might have wanted to see Billy playing the prince, not a swan in the episode with the `Swan Lake',  but this is just a minor detail, maybe designed to underline the consistency of the likable good character.

1279575,5,B00003CXPD,"My gosh,, Billy, Billy, Billy,,  I didn't think too much when I picked this one from BlockBuster, but not only I watched it 3 times in a row, also purchased it the day I rent it.  I frankly don't know where to start with,,  The story itself is pretty interesting;a british boy, who lives in this small coal mining town with intensified strikes going on, happens to find his hidden talent as a ballet dancer.
It is a very powerful movie because it gives out this inspiration, motivation, little push to change your life if you are caught up with the situation/circumstances.  I'm not joking here, but I literally packed all of my video games and systems (which happen to be my precious collection over years) to sell them and move on to be a determined law school student,,(which ended up in unpacking everything i've packed..it was so close though,,).  I mean, I could never ever picture myself throwing away my precious game collections, but this movie actually persuaded me to throw them away to dance for my own dream, almost.  This movie shows a burning desire of a boy, (hold it right there!) you see, do you know what it feels like to have that burning desire? that you wanna do something so bad yet you are strained by your own family,,  This movie did an excellent job on building/developing the struggle by Billy with the family, outside, and himself.  man,, this boy surely knows how to dance,,let me tell you that-  (I'm seriously considering of registering a dance class, though i'm not much of a dancer)
I absolutely agree with the other reviewer who said that this movie was overlooked during Oscar ceremony.  I don't know about you, but i couldn't understand why the Billy Elliot wasn't picked as a best movie, well at least it's better than Gladiator.  This already maginificient movie with struggling, dancing, maturing boy, is again solidified with the father's decision to sacrifice himself utterly, i mean utterly and vague touch of Billy's gay friend, who adds more to the depth of the story with this faint scent of nostalgia.
Aaahh(sigh),, I literally watched his dancing scenes more than,, i don't even remember,,  But this boy, who wants to be a ballet dancer, will either make you cry with tears of determination or give that warmth that you haven't felt for a long time.
Hey people, dance like Billy, dance like Billy to go forth to reach for your dream regardless of the struggle, obstacle, and circumstances,, if Billy can do it, then you and I can do it  =)",993859200,5,2487,4.676605504587156

It will leave you uplifted and reaching for the remote to replay scenes over again.  If you like the energy of Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor, you'll find the dance sequences here equally breathtaking.  The story line is terrific and believable.  The entire cast is exceptional. The family's effort to survive a pivotal coal strike parallels Billy's struggle to get his macho coal-miner dad to understand his son's need to dance.  The scene where Billy dances this message into his dad's heart is not to be missed -- it's more eloquent and moving than any spoken word. And Billy is  a very likable hero -- rough-hewn and flawed himself, but a dancer who is fueled by dance as if it were ""electricity.""  The whole movie is riveting and the last scene is a particular triumph for everyone who's ever struggled for a chance to prove that dreams can come true.

1279579,4,B00003CXPD,"This is a heartwarming film, made all the more delightful by the wonderful, breakout performance of newcomer, Jamie Bell, in the leading role of Billy Elliot.  The son and brother of coalminers, Billy is given boxing lessons by his father but is drawn, instead, to learning ballet. So, he surreptitiously takes ballet lessons.  When his father finds out, all hell breaks loose, as in the macho world of his coalminer father and brother, this is tantamount to a sign that Billy is gay.
Billy's teacher, however, thinks Billy has talent, and attempts to persuade the father to permit Billy to audition for the Royal Ballet School. At first, the father refuses. He is ultimately won over, when Billy gives him a private dance performance so passionate that even he is moved, So, Billy then goes off to London for the audition. What happens next is sure to move even the most stone hearted viewer.
This is ultimately a film about hope and the ability to realize one's dreams. Well acted, it is a film that is sure to delight the viewer. The only real flaw in the film is the sound quality, which tends to be somewhat uneven. All in all, however, this is an excellent film and well worth watching, if only for Billy Elliot's dance scenes.",992908800,4,1233,4.651376146788991

Both his father and brother are toughened miners who are involved in the contemptuous and sometimes violent strike.  Billy's father sends him to boxing lessons, but he is taken with the ballet students in the next room.  The ballet teacher, Mrs. Wilkinson sees that Billy has real talent and she pushes him to higher limits.  Billy hides the fact that he taken ballet from his family as he feels they will look down on him.  Ballet after all isn't for real men, it is for women and poofs.  after his father finds out that he's been taking ballet lessons instead of boxing, he forbids Billy from ballet.  Defiantly Billy continues private lessons with Ms. Wilkinson and eventually his father sees that Billy truly loves ballet and has a chance to try out for the prestigious Royal Academy of Ballet in London.  But due to the strike, the Elliot's are low on money.  In an act of true love, Mr. Elliot, crosses the picket lines to try to earn money to send Billy to the audition.  He is stopped by his oldest son from actually working, but his actions show that he really loves his family.  In the end, Billy gets into the Academy and triumphs in the face of huge odds.  Billy Elliot could have turned into a deliberate melodrama, but first time director Stephen Daldry doesn't allow that to happen.  The main reason is Jamie Bell who does a tremendous job as Billy.  With a glut young actors out there, Mr. Bell is often overlooked.  This will change as his performance shows great depth as he applies comedic and dramatic touches to Billy.  Julie Waters is excellent as Mrs. Wilkinson as is the rest of the cast.  Billy Elliot is a winner all the way.",992822400,4,1839,4.524242424242424

Equally funny yet surely most touching than The Full Monty , Billy Elliot tells the story of a kid whose family life takes some stormy turns when he starts ballet lessons instead of taking box trainings like his father desires. This is a high-quality feel good movie which owes a lot of it's magic to a great cast . It's not only Jamie Bell who is excellent in the title role or Julie Walters who won an Oscar nomination ( the least the academy could do ) for her perfomance as Billy's teacher .

1279582,5,B00003CXPD,"This movie is about a lot of things.  It's about a boy's triumph against all odds.  It's about a family's struggle to be self suffient despite the adversity of class struggle.  It's about communication or lack thereof between father and son, brother and brother, teacher and student.  Above all this movie is about the length to which a father will go to sacrifice, encourage, and love a son who maybe ""a (bleeping)genius,"" regardless of what others might think.
The movie has many levels, but due to my research on fathers, the element I felt most clearly surfaces is that one's belief (particularly a son's) in onesself comes from one's parents (generally his father), or a teacher who sees genius.  Billy encounters these believers on several levels. Billy's dead mother is still very much with him, even though it may only be in a letter he carries in his heart.  Billy's father must learn to deal with his own conception of stereotypes and learn to admire and respect his son's talent, even if he may not have an appreciation for them.  Billy's teacher must realize her belief cannot replace Billy's need for paternal approval.  Billy must also learn to speak up for what he believes--who he is, who are his friends, what he wants to do, or what he feels when he dances.  You'll get wonderfully caught up in this movie as its electricity will flow through your very being.
There is some strong language in this movie, but if can get beyond that, the moments will not be lost at what an important message is in this movie.  Once we learn to look at what talents our children have, we must then do everything we can to help them develop, refine, and enjoy.  This movie is by far one of the best I've seen in a long time and should be mandatory viewing for every father with a son who marches to a different drummer.
Rent it or buy it.  If you are a middle school teacher, preview it first (for language) but I'd recommend it as mandatory viewing for 12 or 13 year old, who would discuss it with thier parents and then complete an essay about ""What if you want to be something your dad doesn't understand when you grow up?""",992649600,,2125,4.51958224543081

1279632,5,B00003CXPD,"This was one of the most touching movies I have seen for a log time. Most of the reviews concentrate on the theme of the young boy wanting to dance and escape the daily boredom of a small village in England. Young Jamie Bell is a natural. He really is the young boy, perfectly normal who only has a bit of an unusual hobby. That alone would have made this an exxcellent movie.
The second theme, much more under-emphasized is the sheer desparation in a small English miners village, where the effects of the Tatcher government is taking it's toll. The mine is going to get closed and all the villagers are out of work with no chance at all on alternative employment. This drives a probaly perfectly harmonious community to take sides against each other which can only be separated by the police.
Gary Lewis, to me, is the star of this movie ( why not nominated for an Oscar) as he embodies the worries; the allegiance to his brothers in arms and the concern for his family. It is heartbraking to see when he finally makes his choice and breaks the picket; It shows a man who is driven to sheer desparation and defying all he believed in in order to help realize his son'dream.

I found the film very entertaining, the performances are wonderful, and it deals with the question of dealing with being gay (Billy's friend) in a very sweet and non-judgemental way. The only comment I have to make is that I thought the father's change of attitude (from being quite aggressive and forbidding Billy to pursue his ballet classes to totally understanding and supportive) in a rather short time slightly unbelievable. However, to include the struggle between him and Billy's teacher would probably not have made the film more interesting, since in the end the story is about Billy.

Some of it just didn't make sense within the flow of the movie, as if certain things were just thrown in for the sake of making the movie longer.
I don't want to trash a movie that everyone else seems to love, but I honestly don't see the appeal.  However, my boyfriend whom I anticipated wouldn't like the film at all gave it favorable reviews, so I guess it does have some sort of mass appeal.

Well, needless to say, I was totally blown away.  Jamie Bell's performance was superb, and his emotional roller coaster ride was extremely convincing.  His dancing was also top notch.
The characters did a great job with the hopeless feeling of a struggling town, and the awful effect of the strike on the town's inhabitants.
I laughed and cried, as Billy finally breaks free, and his father finally breaks down and admits that maybe he should give his kid a chance.  The scene in the coal yard with Billy's older brother and dad was a serious tear jerker, and showed a previously unseen tender side to a really nasty dad.
If I have to complain about anything on this DVD is the over all sound quality, and the very difficult to understand dialect.  There were a few times I had to hit the repeat button to understand what had been said.

The story has a great message of being yourself, and following your dreams. It's basically saying that no one knows what's best for you except yourself; do whatever makes you happy.
Jamie Bell was excellent as the title character--showing an impressive range of emotions. The rest of the cast was superb as well. And an unexpected surprise like Billy's supposed gay friend, just makes the movie more complex and interesting!

Jamie Bell, I must say, gave an absolutely stunning performance, which almost made me break down and cry. Julie Walter's was one of the best supporting actresses in a movie of last year, so much emotion was behind every word that she said, you knew you didn't want to mess with her. This story had a great moral, and it was deeply touching.
The reason for my title, is, that this movie has the most meaning to teenagers. It tells them that they can defy all stereotypes and do what they truly want to do, but, this movie was rated 'R'.

The movie is quaint, touching, and extremely well written.  Julie Waters, who played the role of Billy's dance teacher, was exquisite, as was Gary Lewis, who played his father.  (Of course, Jamie Bell, as Billy, was wonderful too.)
The movie starts off slow but builds to a very emotionally moving climax, using a British miners strike in 1984 as the backdrop.  The dialog is sparse, but powerful nonetheless.  And for once, a film takes the time to adquately develop all of the major (and even a few minor) characters.

When Billy discovers his talent and affinity for ballet at age 11, he must overcome the gender stereotyping that prevails in the small, northern-England mining town in which he lives. A tough but sympathetic ballet teacher helps him achieve enough finesse to audition at the Royal Ballet in London, but he must also overcome his father's and his brother's objections. The audition is painful to watch--it put me in mind of a similar audition in ""Flashdance"": the same dour panel of judges.
Jamie Bell, who plays Billy, is delighful and a very good dancer as well. His infrequently seen smile transforms his entire face.

It's a great and inspirational video, but they could have slipped in a few more intelligent words rather than mere swears (It's so funny to hear the English swear in this movie). It's so hard to put words out - why can't you merely dance them out?
It's beautifully done. It has the English 'spot' in it. The withering 'Cup of Tea' style, I get that snuffy posh feeling when I hear them speak, yet it's amazing how this video thrives with talent. It's dashing, compelling, and imaginative! It breaks the stereotypes of what males/females should really be doing in life!
And most of all, is the family situation in the movie. The phrase 'So close, yet so far away' comes to mind. How 'radical'.
I was amazed how throughout the whole movie, Billy still stayed the same, and when asked about how he feels when dancing, you can touch with the character still unsure in him.

1279710,4,B00003CXPD,"What happens when a boy from a working class coal mining district wants to study ballet?  This is the plot of this feel-good British film which has won several awards.  It has a statement to make about gender stereotypes and family love and it makes its point loud and clear.
There's some fine acting in this film.  The 14-year old Jamie Bell, cast as Billy, is an excellent actor as well as a good dancer.  I immediately related to his struggle to sneak away from boxing class and study ballet in spite of the disapproval of his father and brother, striking miners who are going through struggles themselves, especially since Billy's mother has recently died.  Julie Walters plays the ballet teacher who believes in Billy, Gary Lewis plays his father, and Jean Heywood is his elderly grandmother who tends to wander away and needs to be taken care of.  Billy's young gay friend is played by Stuart Wells.  Billy is not gay and this entire subject is handled with a high degree of sensitivity.
Some of the British dialog was lost on me and as I was familiar with the plot there were no surprises.  But the tension was kept up throughout with constant obstacles being put in Billy's way.  Even after he has won his father over to his side, he still has the tough examination by the Royal Ballet Academy to contend with and the audience has to sweat this out right along with Billy. I would have liked to see a bit more dancing.  What we do see is excellent but they are all solos performed without costumes.  I wish there was at least one full ensemble piece.

After all the media's mixed opinions on this movie, it was good to sit down and actually see for ourselves what all the hype(good, bad or otherwise) was about. The only other Brit movie we saw this year was the godawful MAYBE BABY, wrongly marketed as comedy. However, BILLY ELLIOT is billed as drama and is often wittier than you think! The subject matter of a young boy becoming a ballet dancer sounded odd and done-before, but it certainly works here! Set in 1984, with the coal miner's strike as a backdrop, young Billy's interest in ballet dancing causes family friction in a macho-male dominated society of the 1980s Britain. His dance teacher, brilliantly played by Julie Walters, encourgaes him to develop his skills and audition for the Royal Ballet School in London. However, his family are not well off - his father and brother are actively involved in the miner's strike with union activity and things come to a head when Billy's brother is arrested for rioting. Those scenes brought back some memories of that time - the retro settings are just great and the musical soundtrack, featuring T-Rex, The Jam, The Clash and assorted classical pieces is interesting(great songs during end credit roll by Stephen Gately and Eagle Eye Cherry too!) and works well with the film's best moments. Jamie Bell is superb as Billy, and his aggressive dancing through the streets scene is a gem, and the message of this dramatic and sometimes amusing movie is that one can overcome all obstacles and achieve their dreams if they persevere!

1279777,5,B00003CXPD,"Billy Elliot is truly one of the year 2000's best films. It is also one, however, that the Oscars overlooked for Best Picture. Billy Elliot was a pure enjoyment and enlightened film. It's about a boy - Billy Elliot - who dreams of becoming a ballet dancer even though his father and basically everybody else he knows doesn't want him to become a ballet dancer because ballet is not for boys...ballet is for girls.
Newcomer Jamie Bell plays the starring role of Billy Elliot, and he performes it very well. Absolutely no flaws with Jamie Bell's performance! And Julie Walters, who plays the strict but fair, ballet teacher, is also excellent. Mrs. Wilkinson is the one who encourages Billy to dance. Julie Walters is just supurb. As well as the rest of the cast.
But it's not the actual story that's enchanting...the real enchantment to this film is the choreography, which is absolutely spectacular! This film is very cleaver and original, and even hilarious at some parts. And it gives a good message, too: nothing is impossible no matter how old you are or what gender, race, etc.
Billy Elliot is definitely a film not to be missed. You must buy Billy Elliot! A pure delight!",988416000,3,1177,4.718446601941747

The performances are solid, Jamie Bell a find, the father great. We've seen the story a million times before. The 'powerful' scene where he dances in anger I found irritating. Cliched on the teacher, Granny, Brother characters.
Great soundtrack though.

1279779,5,B00003CXPD,"Billy Elliot is an 11-year-old boy played by Jamie Bell.  On his way to a boxing lesson, he happened upon a ballet dancing class.  Soon he discovered that he was very good at ballet, and he then wanted to become a dancer despite his family's wishes.  This is a really touching and inspirational film about achieving dreams that will leave you cheering!
This is easily one of the best movies I have ever seen, and I have seen quite a few considering that I'm only 14.  ""Billy Elliot"" is very similar to ""October Sky"", which is another great movie.  (Even the kid's dad is a coal miner!)  But it is also very different in the way that it is much more complex and subtle.  I have noticed that because this is a British movie, it seems to be a lot more daring than most American movies, with a lot of things that Americans might consider extraneous.  But that's what I like about it; Every character is so well developed even if they have a very small role (e.g. Billy's supposedly gay friend).  These little aspects of these minor characters add a really nice touch to the already powerful story.
Also, DON'T let the R-rating fool you.  THIS IS A FAMILY MOVIE.  This movie is NOT pornographic, or violent, or chock-full of coke-sniffing.  It just contains some language that little kids shouldn't use.  Even so, the profanity is used very maturely.  It is never gratuitous or unnecessary, it's just how these British people speak.  And the film never seems to glorify the use of such language.
This film was WAY overlooked at the Oscars.  It's definitely better than ""Gladiator"".  ""Gladiator"" may have cool combat actoin, but it's got a very straightforward plot which doesn't make you think.  I have NO IDEA why Jamie Bell wasn't nominated for his act.  He has a very auspicious start in his filom career with this movie!
If there's one thing to criticize about this movie, it's the fact that the dialogue is spoken with heavy British accents, making it hard to understand at times.  But that's not enough to keep me from saying that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen!  Watch ""October Sky"" first, to give you an idea of how an American movie tells a dream, then watch ""Billy Elliot"" for a more sophisticated British idea.",987984000,23,2233,4.574307304785894

1279874,5,B00003CXPD,"One of the best, and most underappreciated films of the last Oscar season is Billy Elliot. A compelling, heartbreaking-then-warming story combined with a crackerjack cast makes for a highly entertaining and film that totally transcends struggle and celebrates human desire.
Billy, so magnificently and perfectly played by Jamie Bell, is a working class kid with a penchant for ballet, discovered quite by accident but soon fuels his dreams. Julie Walters, Grand Bitter Queens of Ex-Dance Dreamers takes the strapping lad under her wing to teach him how to fly. As Billy strives to dance, he find himself struggling against the harsh dynamics of his family, embroiled with the dyamics of a miners' strike.
The story in the film is a guaranteed winner, but soon transcends itself as it deals with devotion to dreams, selflessness, and the power of teaching and learning. It's about the eternal hope we all carry to aspire, to achieve, to blossom no matter what ; Billy names our drive to the ultimate of human experience, whatever that may be for you.
The DVD comes with a documentary on the making of Billy Elloit, and thankfully, with English subtitles during some scenes where the accent lays on thick for these American ears.

I went expecting the film to be exactly what the story seemed to be, a young boy wants to be a dancer and though his father forbids it, his hopes triumph in the end. This is not inaccurate as much as overly simplistic.
This film examines not only the father's reaction, but the implausibility of the boy's dream considering the social climate of his home town. It explores the teacher/student relationship and we see the dream of any teacher coming true in her student, but after much conflict. Don't forget a driving force for the boy; his late mother. The power of a fallen parent's hopes for their child is not to be forgotten. Throw in the almost bizzare characters of the older brother and young friend and before the end, if you've paid attention, you find a film about much more than a boy and his dreams. You find the human essence. The ever present conflict of life lived true regardless of conflict or consequence.",987724800,2,991,4.5418994413407825

Julie Walters deserved her best supporting nod as the tough chain smoking dance instructer who sees the potential in Billy and tries to help him realize it.

It is beautiful, funny, heartwarming, tear-jerking, and wonderfully done. Jamie Bell gives one of the best child performances to date. The final moment of the film made me cry like a baby, as did several other moments in the film. Are certain elements gratuitive (the friend, the grandma)? Maybe. Are they distracting? No. The film is so well shot and so well edited that even the slower parts flow brilliantly with the rest of the film.

Every single part of this movie is excellent and there is no boring or dull moment. The acting by the entire cast is absolutely flawless with a great storyline and amazing screenplay. The choreography is above all, one of the best parts of the entire film. Jamie Bell and Julie Walters, who plays the kind but strict dance teacher who urges Billy to dance, are the true stand-out actors in this film.
BILLY ELLIOT is a heartwarming tale and can be tear-jerky at times, too. One of the best sceens is when Billy shows his father how well he can dance when he dances in that room (I forget where they are), and his father is watching him with tears in his eyes. Another one of my favorite sceens is when Billy is dancing down the street.
This is a movie that should be treasured because it is a pure masterpiece. BILLY ELLIOT is one of my favorite films of all time and I really recommend this.

I wasn't going watch this, thinking it's boring old drama (I usually go for sci-fi, action, special effects) and went into the movie by way of entertaining my cousin, who wanted to watch it. But surprise surprise!!! The dance sequences ARE the special effects! They weren't ballet as such, more of a combination of Michael Flatley's Riverdance moves, with quite a lot of Stomp, modern dance and only a pinch of ballet. The choreography convinced me that it was all the action I need in a movie.
True to British movies, Billy Elliot is chocka-block full of subtle messages (e.g. true friendship, the human spirit, following one's own passion, history, brushing off stereotypes, family values, etc.). A major message of the movie is ""have guts to follow your passion"". In fact, we could almost use Gattaca's line for this movie : ""There is no gene for the human spirit"". Very positive messages emanate throughout the film. The fact that Stephen Daldry sidestepped political issues was a blessing in order to give the movie the crispy richness of its content.

Jamie bell is so wacthable, & a good dancer & is so sweet I wanted to give him a great big cuddle. This film will make you cry, beause of Jamie`s performance  & because of the story line. Coming from England & reading about the mine strike when i was little made it feel even more real. Also I loved the music & my favouite  bit is when the brillant julie walters, (another of my favourite pepole), & billy danced to T~Rex`s ""I want to Boogie"", I love that song.

Somebody should cataloque all the swiftly advancing and retreating facial expressions as his character wrestled with issues of gender, familial loyalty, grief and self-fulfillment. I especially liked the big grin that came over his face as he accepted his friend's gayness. Nice moment that.  Someone should consider re-issuing this film without the American-style, insulting and obtrusive soundtrack telling us how to feel at every moment. Imagine Billy's defiant solo in front of his father without the bombastic symphony and you'll get a real idea of what Billy was talking about when he explained how he felt while dancing: ""Electricity, that's it.""

Score: 88/100
One of the most critically accepted movies of 2000, Billy Elliot is a real charmer of a movie that gets better with every minute. It certainly deserves all of its success, and should've been a Best Picture runner-up at the Oscar's 2001, but unfortunately, all it got was 3 nods. Oh, well. At least it got that, or else I would have been pouncing on the Academy!
1984: In a northern England mining town, miners are on strike and the atmosphere is tense. Eleven-year old Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell), whose father (Gary Lewis) and brother (Jamie Draven) are participating in the strike, whose mother has died quite some time ago and whose grandmother is not completely aware of what's going on, doesn't like the brutal boxing lessons at school. Instead, he falls for the girls' ballet lessons. When his folks find out about this unusual love of his, Billy is in trouble. Being supported by the ballet teacher, Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Walters), he keeps on training secretly while the work situation as well as the problems at home get worse. Finally, Mrs. Wilkinson manages to get Billy an audition for the Royal Ballet School, but now he also has to open his heart to his family.
There are heaps of shining stars in the movies that make it all worth while: Stephen Daldry, director, nominated for his extroadinary effort this year, Gary Lewis, who brutally and brilliantly displays his anger and Julie Walters who stuns our emotion every time she peeps a word. But, the film belongs to the amazingly talented Jamie Bell, he is Oscar-worthy and very natural in his role as Billy, and it hasn't been since Haley Joel Osment's performance in The Sixth Sense 2 years ago that we have seen such an engaging child actor. The film is also able to mix comedy, drama and a slight touch of romance into a very acceptable running time, and do it completely relaxed and with style.
Billy Elliot is simply not to be missed! A wonderful achievement!",985392000,10,1956,4.705539358600583

The title character is played by Jamie Bell, who was selected in a search of over 2,000 other boys.  He won a BAFTA for Best Actor for his performance in Billy Elliot.  Julie Walters, who plays Billy's dance teacher, won a BAFTA for Best Supporting Actress.

So why I had to ask myself did I leave the theatre 10 feet of the ground feeling so good about myself and ready to give the human race one more benefit of the doubt.
This is unabashedly one of those feel good films of the year and dosent pretend to be otherwise. The simple plot of young working class lad with striking miner father who shows a penchant for the ballet to the squeamishness of his father and brother has been well documented by other reviewers better than me. The exceptional performances by Jamie Bell as the budding dancer and Julie Walters as the burnt out cynical dance teacher have received all the credit that is their due.
Undoubtedly the story is flawed in some parts to allow for heterosexual tastes. The scene that proves Billys straight as an arrow who just wants to dance to prove to homophobics that not all dancers are poofs. Just one minor complaint that dose not add or detract from the story.
Billy Elliot is up against some big guns at this years oscars. Gladiator, Traffic, Erin Brockovich are all commendable efforts which will receive their fair amount of kudos this year, and Jamie and Julie will no doubt lose out to Russel Crowe or Tom Hanks or Julia Roberts But for all that I still place it in the top ten of my personal best list.

That's what Billy's father, Jackie probably thought when he was confronted with the painful (to him) realization that his 11 year old son wanted to do Ballet.  Boys do Boxing, like he and Billy's grandfather did, or wrestle - ""they don't do ballet"". Well, Billy takes after his deceased mother who played piano and whom, Billy's grandmother tells him, could have been a professional dancer. Billy enjoys watching Fred Astaire dance in those old movies and when he starts watching the ballet lessons that share the gym with his boxing classes - he's hooked.
The film is set in Durham, England during the bitter coal miners strikes of 1984. The social tensions and economic hardships are portrayed with frequent views of riot clad policemen and in the difficulty Jackie and Tony (Billy's foul mouthed older brother) have in just feeding the family. The tensions are of course there when father and brother find out that Billy has been taking the money for boxing and attending ballet classes.
The film handles the family relationships well. Jamie Bell (Billy) is excellent in portraying the passion with which he comes to have for his dancing and the acting of Gary Lewis as Jackie - showing outrage, disapproval, grudging acceptance and then support, largely with facial expressions - is excellent. There is a scene that shows this subtle acting best. Billy, dancing and Jackie watching, show their feelings completely without a word being expressed.
A very good 'feel good' movie, light on the sentimentality and just enough weight on the 'heavy' topic of father and son relationship.",982022400,2,1611,5.033707865168539

The ignorence of those that say, "" boys can't be dancers"", and the love of one of the boys for the other ( Billy Elliot )...I find the rating in the US absurd..18y...its a nice movy with wonderfull unknown actors..absolutly brilliant.....The movie of the year already..a must for all...",981331200,4,403,4.611111111111111
1280062,2,B00003CXPD,"In today's professional sports, there are a lot of football players who take ballet to improve their leaping skills and speed rates, but I don't understand the entire point of this movie. I really like the character who portrayed Billy: he was a real emotional and solid character that you really had to enjoy. But, going from a sport that is about fists to a sport that is about grace made him look like somewhat of a wimp, and I don't think that was his role. Billy Elliot was to be a real winner, someone who has his mind set on success and no one has a remote chance of getting in his way. I would say that that character quality was addressed, but the movie tried to make him look like a kind of weirdo, not a sparkplug. The idea of this movie was good, but most of the movie showed him being looked at as feminine, which ruined the whole cause of the movie.
 The one pleasant surprise was that he didn't quit boxing because of an injury or peer pressure for the most part. All in all, it had problems staying on the correct topic, which is unfortunate and really disabled the entertainment level.",981072000,2,1102,4.323671497584541
1280063,5,B00003CXPD,"This is without doubt the best film of 2000 and, for me, the best I have seen in a very long time. Newcomer Jamie Bell has that rare talent few actors have of making you very concerned about what happens to the character they play. For me it captures beautifully the pain of being at odds with those around you, and the determination to succeed in the face of adversity. The supporting cast is superb, with very powerful and emotional performances.  I have seen this film no less than 5 times at the cinema and enjoyed it as much every time.  There are many parts to this movie that capture your imagination, but the scene where Billy's brother Tony confronts his father at the pit, when he crosses the picket line, is simply one of the most emotionally charged scenes I have ever seen, in any film, and it stayed with me long after I first saw it, I highly recommend this film to anyone who likes well acted and true to life British drama.",979344000,4,940,4.365714285714286

1280065,5,B00003CXPD,"Because 2000 has been the worst year in film since I have been alive, I have been skepical about all films released this year.  However, ""Billy Elliot"" is a pleasant surprise.  So pleasant, in fact, that I have seen it four times.  And in a year this terrible, I predict many an Oscar nomination for this delight; though in a regular year, I think the Academy would be apt to ignore ""Billy Elliot"".
Award predictions aside, I have never in my life become so emotionally involved with an entire set of characters; each one of them is to die for.  From opening credits in which Billy is bouncing on his bed, all the way through the closing credits in which Billy gives one valiant and triumphant leap, I found myself engulfed by a myriad of emotions.  Happiness, frustration, elation, anticipation, sadness, and more than a few tears; I had to remind myself it was just a movie.
Jamie Bell, the amazing young actor who plays Billy Elliot, gives a stellar performance that is beautifully enhanced by the other actors in the cast.  Bell's acting, not to mention his dancing, put the skills of any other actor of the year to shame.  He may not deserve any top awards for his effort but, WOW--what a stupendous natural talent.  Kudos to him for so acutely portraying the importance of self-expression in coping with emoitional pain and living life.
On the whole, ""Billy Elliot"" is well done.  The directing is ace, as is the editing.  The soundtrack is perfection.  And just for the sake of it, the acting is the best ensemble effort of the year.  By far.
Upon first viewing, ""Billy Elliot"" established itself as a permanant fixture in my Top Ten Favorite films of all time.  Not because it is one of the ten best ever, but because in this year of constant let downs, ""Billy Elliot"" is my knight in shining armour.  It arrived just in time to restore my faith in quality filmmaking.  It is everything a movie should be and it is everything most movies are not: original, emotional, wonderfully collaborative and above all entertaining.",977788800,27,2029,4.644257703081233
1280066,4,B00003CXPD,"Billy Elliot is a sweet movie with wonderful performances but I kept having this nagging feeling that I had just seen this film recently. I know there are just so many formulas and plots for films but these two are just too close in every way. If I had to chose the better film it would be ""October Sky.""",977788800,2,304,4.169491525423729

1280068,3,B00003CXPD,"It is always SO refreshing to get the opportunity to watch a British film when you are overfed with all this Hollywood stuff which is basicly always the same. Especially the British humour is a LOT more original (and in fact FUNNY!) than the worn-out Hollywood gags, and the characters in British films seem so incredibly REAL.
One genre the Brits are excellent in is socialrealistic films. Billy Elliot is another film of this genre.
Originally, it was called Dancer - but because of the release of Dancer In The Dark, the makers changed the title to avoid confusion. And Billy Elliot is indeed about... Billy Elliot... who is a dancer.
Or who becomes one. It's an 11 year old boy, living in a lower class family without a mother, in a mining town. He's got this enormous natural talent for dancing - but, of course, lads don't dance!
But Billy sure does...
Even though it's a good film, with a good story and excellent acting, Billy Elliot doesn't reach the level of e.g. The Full Monty. At times it tends to become too sentimental, an unlucky Hollywood infection, I fear.
Still, it's really worth a go!",976060800,8,1105,4.614213197969543

They all relate to the family dynamics, and the pressures to be masculine, and it's good for them to see that even if your parents might not seem to support you at first, they do love you. This one along with Stand By Me shows true friendship and understanding of what troubles boys and empathy for them as humans, not cliches.",1519344000,,407,4.368421052631579
