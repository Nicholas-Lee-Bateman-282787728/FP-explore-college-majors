8609256,5,B00ET9IGAY,The above is what was intended to be conveyed in every PTKGO video.  This proves no exception.  Enjoy,1436745600,,101,4.555555555555555
8609257,5,B00ET9IGAY,"An excellent instructional video demonstrating the empty-hands system of Pekiti-Tirsia Kali. Tim Waid covers empty-hand attacks, parries, kick destructions and throws while clearly demonstrating how each relates to the double knife, from which the empty-hand system is based. Whether you're a beginning student, advanced or even an instructor, this DVD is an invaluable resource.  I continuously refer to this DVD as well as the other instructional videos in this series.  Tim Waid's mastery of the Pekiti-Tirsia system is apparent throughout.",1421107200,3,543,5.775
8609258,5,B00ET9IGAY,"Tim Waid teaches Pangamut in a clear, progressive, and effective manner. The drills are taught progressively from mechanics, and to the different stages in timing and tactics. Combined with the Footwork System, and the fact the Empty Hands System is derived from the Doble Daga System, there is little wasted transition time to become functional in empty hands.",1421107200,2,361,5.241379310344827
8609259,5,B00ET9IGAY,Well presented material that demonstrates Tim Waid's mastery of his art and ability to explain in easily understood terms how to reach a higher level of proficiency. I recommend the entire DVD series to anyone interested in Pekiti Tirsia or Filipino Martial skills in general. He shows direct application of weapon based skills transferring over to empty hands in this presentation of Pangamut.,1421020800,3,394,5.26984126984127
8609260,5,B00ET9IGAY,"Tim Waid offers a clear and informative demonstration of the fundamentals of Pekiti-Tirsia Kali system of empty hands.  The empty hand system is broken down and analyzed according to tactics, attacks, parries, destruction, kicking, bridging, combinations, and more.  Also explained is how the knife (single and double) is the basis for and complements the empty hands.  This video is professional and all content is well articulated, explained, and demonstrated.  Anyone looking to supplement and add to their existing training and knowledge or if you are just starting should get this video.",1421020800,4,592,5.472527472527473
8609261,5,B00ET9IGAY,"Tim Waid does an excellent job of communicating the fundamentals of PANGAMUT/DUMOG and how they are part of the PTK-SMF system. This DVD really shines when used in conjunction with the other DVD's Tim Waid has made, but it can be used as a stand alone training material too. I use this DVD almost on a weekly basis as a reference for my training.",1420848000,2,346,4.421875
8609262,5,B00ET9IGAY,"Tim Waid is a master of communicating clear and concise points both verbally and in motion. Solid fundamental drills and tactics for practical and dynamic combat empty hands are demonstarted. Pekiti-Tirsia empty hands are easy to learn without damaging the hand. Simplistic off-balancing techniques of Dumog are very useful as are the basic throws shown. It's a great DVD, especially when accompanied with the Footwork (basic/Adv.), Solo Daga. Pekiti-Tirsia empty-hand system comes from training the knife (striking mechanics, tactics, etc), however it can be a standalone training practice. Having the videos in DVD format makes it very efficient for re-watching specific techniques and tactics. Training integrates well with DVDs throughout the PTKGO video series. Training is applicable to military, law enforcement, security, and civilian personal protection.",1420761600,5,863,5.857142857142857
8609263,2,B00ET9IGAY,Not exactly what I was looking for. Only 2 throws demonstrated. Techniques shown were not reality based fighting techniques. Their destructions were ok but that was about it. If you are looking for reality based fighting techniques I would look elsewhere.,1418860800,3,255,5.2439024390243905
8609264,1,B00ET9IGAY,"Very limited technique. Too many assumptions and ""gospel truth"" type teaching method. Tuhon Leo Gaje does not approve of him.",1418083200,3,125,5.3
