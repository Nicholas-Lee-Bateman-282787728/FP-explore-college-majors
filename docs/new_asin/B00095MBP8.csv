2266084,4,B00095MBP8,"They were fun and informative! I definitely feel like a pin up queen now! So try it, you will love it!",1281312000,,102,3.9047619047619047
2266085,3,B00095MBP8,"As the others have noted, the production quality and style is something we don't normally see anymore; there seems to be minimal editing and the girls seem nervous and scripted at times. While the meandering chatter and laid-back attitude of the whole thing was, indeed, charming, I think it's fair to warn others about it going in...if listening to a slew of simple tips and tricks while a woman has her hair set, taken down, and brushed out in real time isn't for you, then neither is this DVD. What makes ""How to be a Pinup Model"" special is the personalities of the ladies involved. The tips are good, but most of them are very simple. If you're entirely new to retro-glam styling, this is a great place to start. If not, you might be disappointed.

Bottom line: This is a sweet, charming intro to Retro-Pinup smile, by two ladies who clearly know what they're talking about. Great for a girl's night in or slumber party, not so great for someone looking for more in-depth advice.

On a side note - Both girls travel with the Pretty Things Peep Show, and give a live, hands-on class version of this dvd in the cities they visit. Judging from the dvd, I'd say it would def. be worth the money to attend if the show comes to your area.",1281139200,6,1237,4.4449339207048455
2266086,5,B00095MBP8,"Keeping in mind this is pure-retro, I loved how meandering the pace was. It's not mtv-flash editing. It's, honestly, very fifties. Makeup, hair, and cheesecake-posing; exactly what the video promises. I loved the hairstyle secion the most. They do an entire hair set, and then when she is combing the set out, it's real-time and I got the sense of the fifties, no cellphones, no rush, pretty night-table, sweet smiles. I felt like I was at a sleep-over and we were doing our hair in Grease. I adored the big hair-rolls they demo'd. These two women fully embrace the fifties lifestyle. And they portray a sexy-lady without apology. The make-up section was a bit long in the tooth, but great for beginners. The posing section was really nice and encouraging too. It's very girls-night-out-with-class and the production value, tho simple, was just right; great, authentic 50s set-dressing, good audio, and most of all inspirational. If you like the fifties and want to try your hand (gams?) at cheesecake photos, or even just want to investigate the fifties look - and outlook - this is a comforting, stylish & feminine place to get started.",1279584000,29,1138,4.901554404145077
2266087,5,B00095MBP8,"This DVD is great, the two young ladies involved are not super slick Hollywood products, they look a little staged and uncomfortable at various times which, to me adds to the charm.

The tips and ideas are great for anyone who wants to look retro and/or wants the pin-up girl look. Nicely packaged, good editing and simple manageable chapters make this a great buy for the money.

Only gripe is why such a pretty girl like Go-go Amy would want to have a arm full of tattoo's (and ugly one at that) and everyone that has seen my DVD has commented much the same.",1278979200,2,560,4.375

2266132,5,B00095MBP8,Fun and informative. Great style of instruction and modeling! The women definitely know what they are talking about! Want more from them!,1391817600,,137,5.2727272727272725
2266133,3,B00095MBP8,"The video was okay. No chapter on DVD so if you only want to see one section you have to manually fast forward to it. But it is  good product for beginners.

Also, be aware this is a DVD, not a book. I was searching for pin-up books (under the book category on Amazon's search function) and this showed up.  I assumed it was a book since that what I searched for. Nope.  But its okay, the DVD still has some good info.",1387238400,,418,4.0
2266134,3,B00095MBP8,i expected more from this video. a lot of what it said i already knew. but i do recommend for beginners.,1383350400,,104,4.0
2266135,4,B00095MBP8,"Although I was expecting a book, I didn't look too closely at the finer details when I ordered it, I'm kinda glad it was a dvd in the end. The video instruction on how to do make-up was especially helpful, I was able to do the cat eye with liquid eye liner almost perfectly by my second attempt (the first attempt was close!). The rest of the instruction is practical and playful too.
Definitely recommend if you are trying the look for the first time.",1373587200,,452,4.329411764705882
2266136,5,B00095MBP8,"I do pinup photography, and use this to show clients as they get hair and makeup done to get them hyped up and give them posing tips. We all love that they even include facial expressions. Fantastic video!!",1368144000,,206,4.447368421052632
2266137,4,B00095MBP8,"This video is well organized and the instruction is provided in a manner that is easy to follow.  The section on makeup is adequate and really good for someone who is new to makeup.  It gives great detail on applying lashes (plus) and eyeliner (very helpful) but it assumes you know how to use foundation and blush.  Also, the models are obviously using shimmer and there is no mention of it.  So if you already know how to create a flawless, dewy complextion, this will give you the rest.

The hair section was amazing.  It was a step by step, live time tutorial on setting and styling your hair.  It covered several classic pin-up styles in detail.  This section was by far the most helpful and complete. This section alone is worth the price of the video.

The posing is somewhat helpful.  It gives a few classic poses and some tips and tricks to make them work better for defferent body types. It is great for beginners and someone who really wants to get that authentic pin-up look.  I would have preferred a bit more detail about body mechanics in posing, but it is a solid basic overview.

The two models/ producers are fun and likeable and easy to listen to.

I definately recommend this if you have any interest in creating a pinup look for photos or a fun night out.",1363910400,2,1276,4.448275862068965
2266158,5,B00095MBP8,"I really wanted to start doing a vintage look because it just looks so beautiful, but as I've never really ventured further into hair and make-up beyond my trusty black eyeliner and ponytail, I really had NO IDEA where to start. This video was perfect, I caught a clip of the hair part on youtube and had to buy the video, its got great make-up tips and hair tutorials. I actually have my hair in rollers right now after follwing the video. I love that the video is real too, on the make-up part, the make-up doesnt go on absolutly perfectly, but the end result looks fabulous, so it makes you feel more confident about not getting everything right on the first try. the only thing i was dissapointed in was that it advertises that it teaches you about clothes, but theres no mention of clothes in the video. i still feel like i got my moneys worth though!",1361232000,,856,4.389937106918239
2266159,3,B00095MBP8,"This video was recommended to me by a friend who has done some pinup modeling.  I was expecting...more.  Yes, they do show you how to do makeup and hair, how to pose, that sort of thing - just like they claim on the jacket.  However, the video isn't very long, and they don't go into other styles or eras besides, basically, rockabilly.

The introduction seemed like a cheap home video tagged onto the production, and they didn't use a script, so there were ""ums"" and so forth.  In the section regarding poses, the were in the kitchen posing on the floor between a stove and a staircase, it looked crowded.  They later showed poses on a bed, but I would have expected them to demonstrate the poses in a more professional-photographic-session set.

There is another ""pinup how-to"" video out there that has *8 hours* of material, covering many eras' looks.  Pinup isn't confined to the 1950s, I was disappointed that this video was so limited.  I will likely be getting the other video as well.

I did, however, enjoy the songs that were obviously created for each woman, Bettina May and Go Go Amy.  The quality of the instructional part of the video was much higher than the introduction, and the house they filmed in was very nice.",1360281600,,1231,4.60091743119266
2266160,5,B00095MBP8,This video gives great tips for a beginner model. Very easy to follow instructions. Great looks that anyone can do! I would highly recommend buying this dvd.,1360022400,,157,4.851851851851852
2266161,4,B00095MBP8,"I bought this in preparation for a photo shoot.  It was helpful in how to do hair, make-up, & perfect a pose.  I recommend.",1359158400,,123,4.083333333333333
2266162,4,B00095MBP8,Cool video! I got it just for wondering what was on it! They give great tips and ideas! I would say a good buy for some one trying to start into Pin Up,1358294400,,151,3.606060606060606
2266163,5,B00095MBP8,this cd is so much fun.  i learned so much watching it and will learn even more when i watch it again.  great for self esteem,1355961600,,125,3.769230769230769

2266165,3,B00095MBP8,Its OK but not a lot of useful information.  Has some pretty girls in it but its more for the model than the photographer.,1355270400,,122,4.083333333333333
2266166,4,B00095MBP8,I liked the easy to follow tips for posing. The make-up and hair tutorials give a great first idea if you intend to get dolled up like this for the first time. Great if you have a photo shoot and need some input.,1355184000,,212,3.953488372093023
2266167,5,B00095MBP8,"As a photographer, I found the video to be helpful in understanding how makeup and hair is done for pin-up.  Also helpful in suggesting classic pinup poses and looks.",1354320000,,166,4.724137931034483
2266188,4,B00095MBP8,"Cute video, a lot of pointers not just on posing, but hair, make up, outfits as well. A good starting point for any ""would be"" pin up.",1348790400,,134,4.0
2266189,4,B00095MBP8,"This is so fun and girly. The techniques are pretty basic, stuff most people have probably seen before, but they add tips on how to use modern styling tools to create vintage looks. They use foam rollers for a wet set, which is good thinking.

Another reviewer mentioned the editing, and it's definitely at a slower pace than most  tutorials I've seen. Each look is made up of one long shot, and that's appropriate for a vintage piece, convention-wise. I don't meant make it sound like the production value is low, because it's fine, but there are some little quirks about this video:  ladies look sort of nervous on camera, the camera is handheld, and there's a lot of big band going on. I found it endearing.",1344297600,2,710,4.574803149606299

2266192,3,B00095MBP8,"Cute DVD. Go Go Amy & Betina May give lots of useful tips and tricks. Betina May does seem a bit nervous and gets tongue tied throughout the video but it doesn't take away from the video. The reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 5 is the reason already mentioned by others & that is the production. The angles the camera man chose to shoot was odd, other than that it was pretty good.",1335916800,,383,4.052631578947368

2266195,5,B00095MBP8,"This video is great! The girls give great instructions on how to put on 50s style makeup, how to do a 50s style hairstyle for short or long hair, and the girls show how to get lots of looks from the same pose.

Is the video all and everything? No, but for the information they provide, the examples they show and the attitude each exude, 'How to be a Pinup Model' should be plenty to get you well on your way to understanding the pinup look, how to achieve it through makeup and sell it to the camera...and how to have fun doing it.

2266208,4,B00095MBP8,"I love this movie.  I purchased it on a recommendation from Lisa Freemont Street to learn some hair and makeup techniques and ended up watching the whole thing instead of just those sections.  If you can get past the cheesiness of the girls (which is not too bad), you can see how really informative it is.
Not too long after getting this I was asked to do a pinup shoot and the tips near the end of the video were really helpful.
I would recommend this to others, especially for the price.",1304553600,,490,4.315217391304348
2266209,5,B00095MBP8,"This was a really fun video to watch.  I have a couple of books on the subject, but it's way more interesting and beneficial to actually watch somebody else doing it!  From the makeup, hair and even the posing, it was fabulous!",1302652800,,227,4.380952380952381
2266210,2,B00095MBP8,"I wish I could say I loved this more because it has everything you would need to start being a vintage pinup.
I bought this hoping that I could have a fun thing to share with my girlfriends during a sleepover or even save for a bachelorette party, etc.
I've had my nose buried in books, video tutorials, and movies about vintage pinups for a long long time, and when I finally saw this dvd, I was a little disappointed.
While it is kitschy and cute, it also looks a little sloppy. Personally, I think it needs to be edited better because I found myself bored and fastforwarding through a lot of it.

The makeup section had some nice tips for long-lasting wear (like powdering your lipstick after blotting, and then reapplying) but you could see where the makeup was just badly done. The lipstick got smudged here and there, and the eyeliner was a little messy. To be honest, I've seen better makeup videos on youtube.

As far as the hair goes, it was okay. I highly recommend anyone looking for good vintage hairstyles to either check out some books on here or go to youtube and check out [...] who does fabulous hairdo's.

The part about the way to pose was refreshing, as I didn't know about the way you can hide or accentuate the body by just turning slightly at an angle.

Like I said, I wish with all my heart that I could have liked this more, but was sadly disappointed.",1300406400,34,1377,4.3882352941176475
2266211,5,B00095MBP8,"The dvd delivers a clear understanding of a glamorous era of fashion. Provides easy-to-follow instructions for styling makeup and hair, though they may take some practice to master. Variations on styles were offered and examples were given. All things considered, I am pleased with the purchase and intend to style my hair for an upcoming party at a retro diner.",1299024000,,362,5.05
2266212,2,B00095MBP8,"I just watched the video and I have to say this video is not what I expected. I guess someone who has never seen pin up anything might want to watch this but if you are familiar with basics of pin up modeling then I wouldn't bother. The majority of the video is spent on hair and makeup which you can learn on your own in books such as Vintage Hairstyling by Lauren Rennells or You Tube. I was hoping they would explain further how to get into pin up modeling and what to expect when you are on sets and such. I wish they touched on other resources and where to go if you need help getting started. I do have to agree with the other reviewer that this is very amateur and the models seemed nervous at times and there was very little editing when it was needed such as the makeup mess up. I was a little stunned at the poor application of makeup considering that Go Go Amy has done makeup. I guess for the price, I would suggest not to have any high expectations.",1290902400,3,962,4.095238095238095

The program ""how-to"" sections inform the viewwer on:

Hair- a complete hair set with combout, types of curlers, setting lotions, pinning the hair back and creating rolls, creating bangs without cutting bangs

 Makeup- applying foundation, blush, lining the eyebrow, using cake eyeliner for the mysterious "" cat eyes"" and the finishing touch, false eyelashes!

Pointers for photo shoots- Standing and sitting poses to accentuate curves, using vowels to change facial expression.

 This program was so delightful,I felt amongst friends and a bit nostalgic about those Friday night sleepovers with crazy girl friends.",1283731200,11,864,5.217391304347826

Having said all of that, this is a well produced dvd for those that want to go back to 40's and 50's glamour. The ladies are quite entertaining. You are shown how to apply makeup and do your hair like Betty Grable and to pose with your best assets to the camera. If you want to learn how to pose artfully in your unmentionables for that special loved one, you'll learn how to do that here. As for me, I'll skip this one.

Both absolutely gorgeous and with flaming red hair, Go-Go Amy also has jet black highlights in her hair (stunning when hanging down in ringlets) and sports some nifty tattoos.

They give you excellent tips, and modern techniques to achieve the vintage ""pin-up"" look. The makeup is really quite simple, and one you'll need to learn if you want to be an actress or dancer (retro is so ""In""!) or just have fun at your next party. The bright red of course is the way to go, on lips and fingernails. Most important of all, are the cat eyes! May demonstrates on Bettina the easiest way to get the ""cat eye"" line beyond your eye lids, and how to apply those stunning false eyelashes.

The posing section is humorous and instructive, and the duo shows us how to make the most of our assets. I love the ""vowel"" smiles and expressions, and now I know the trick of why the pin-up girls looked so good kneeling back on their heels. It's quite  a little secret! (you have to have strong thigh muscles...and sit up a couple of inches from your heels, so the flab on the back of your thighs doesn't spill over, and your thigh muscles look long and lean!).

This is a very cute and instructive DVD from these 2 delightful glamour gals. You'll enjoy every second of its 80 minute length.",1281398400,13,1380,4.464285714285714
