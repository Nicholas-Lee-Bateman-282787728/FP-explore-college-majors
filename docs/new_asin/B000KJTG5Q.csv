8157235,1,B000KJTG5Q,"Its available on youtube, its pretty cheesy with some interviews from his family and a few minutes of audio interviews from jail at the end. The editing is terrible, the acting is terrible and the budget must have been near ZERO as it looks like it was done by middle school age kids. Yes its that bad. Instead buy the audio biography that came out recently written by Freeway Rick Ross himself that goes much further into detail. Its worth a free watch on youtube, but not worth it for 1 cent more than free.",1456704000,,509,4.368421052631579

8157239,1,B000KJTG5Q,"I saw Rick Ross on 60 Minutes so naturally I was interested, another ""American Gangster"" but this documentary here is just garbage, another lame attempt to capitalize on the popularity of documentaries like "" The Cocaine Cowboys"" , epic fail.

P.s. I recommend you watching this if you can find a used copy for less than $3 lol",1259884800,,327,4.637931034482759

8157241,1,B000KJTG5Q,"for a man who made $300,000 to a million dollars a day selling drugs, this movie could be very informative and entertaining. but what you will start to notice is that they use the same 20 minutes of footage and replay it over and over again to stretch the movie out, and it gets REALLY ANNOYING. honestly its distracting because you start paying more attention to how many times they replay the same stuff. if you want to see a real movie watch cocaine cowboys or cocaine cowboys 2, its very well put together and has a production budget, everything that this movie lacks.

sorry for such a negative review but this dvd really sucks!",1221609600,6,633,4.504347826086956
