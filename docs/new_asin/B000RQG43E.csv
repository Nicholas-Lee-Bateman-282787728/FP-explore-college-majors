8311016,5,B000RQG43E,"Not to be Confused with Cheerleader Massacre

How might it be that I've remained uninformed for so long, about this shitefest of genius lunacy? I admit I popped one when I watched it. Well, two, truth told. One would be forgiven for erroneously entertaining the idea that it's a movie of absolutely no worth. but to judge it by conventional standards only reveals a less than willing mind state. I mean, you have to be some kind of glutton for punishment to sit through the entire thing. So punish me if you must. There remains no denying that this no budget production has leftfield moments of absolute hilarity. I must be some kind of masochist because I actually think I'm going to try to watch it again!",1440460800,,707,4.566929133858268
8311017,1,B000RQG43E,"Cheerleader Autopsy:

A group of 5 cheerleaders who represent the Stinkwater High School Beavers (Florida) will represent their city in the national championship. The film consists of the expected crude beaver jokes. The bus crashes and the cheerleaders are killed (figure out from revealing title). They are taken to the Gristle Creek mortuary which consists of a group of quirky perverts. As it turns out one of the disfigured girls is not dead yet.

The film is low budget and has that super VHS look to it. The jokes are idiotic and old. Puns are made by the names such as ""Helen Bedd."" The special effects consist of cheap rubber parts that look less realistic than the stuff they sell at the Halloween Store. Strictly low brow stuff.

Parental guide: F-bomb, nudity (Misty Kapp)

...the Movie: Russell (Joel Weiss)has a junk food diet that leads to his production of gas which he enjoys to the dismay of everyone around him. While his wife Heather (Shannandoah Sorin) is away, Russell watches TV. The movie consists of a ""Groove Tube"" montage humor involving fart humor. Perhaps the best feature was the ""Gong Show"" parody. Very low brow stuff.

Parental guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1350864000,,1195,4.8669950738916254
