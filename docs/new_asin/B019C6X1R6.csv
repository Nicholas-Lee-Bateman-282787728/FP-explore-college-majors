7570185,5,B019C6X1R6,"This film is simply transcendent.  Rose McGowan is an underrated actress who brings everything to the table, and does so here with her usual charm. Expertly edited, with a driving storyline. More than meets the eye in every way.",1461888000,,228,4.846153846153846

7570189,2,B019C6X1R6,Don't do it!  I often rent movies because some actors always make fabulous movies; Rose McGowan is one of them.  I sure wish I had listened to the bad reviews though.

7570193,4,B019C6X1R6,"A very interesting revision of the Poe classic! As the characters interact, you see how far the mind in willing to go to protect itself from the harsh realities of life. Patrick Flueger and Rose McGowan pair well with each other throughout the movie. While La Tier script and direction helps the movie flow between sequences, as reality and fantasy blend together and are separated.",1461283200,,382,4.892307692307693

7570209,5,B019C6X1R6,The twist of PTSD as a cause for this interesting version of the standard Poe's treatment of a demented mind is intense and haunting,1460851200,,132,4.541666666666667

7570211,1,B019C6X1R6,"Hmmmmmmmmmmm, apparently the person who made the film has a lot of fans.  All of them didn't even have a ""verified purchase"" icon.  I'm too leary about watching it as NO movie gets 5 stars from so many people",1460851200,,208,4.3076923076923075

It was entertaining and a great job was done by all involved! Patrick is a great talent and really shines in this movie!",1460764800,,254,4.204081632653061
7570213,5,B019C6X1R6,"Wonderful movie. Rose McGowan again proves she is truly an incredible artist. Movie is reminiscent of older haunting horror movies. There are no gory in your face scares, just an overall feeling of dread throughout. Well done.",1460678400,,226,5.135135135135135
7570214,1,B019C6X1R6,PTSD! No psychological twist at all. A nice try of showing the negative affect of the condition if you are a simpleton.,1460678400,2,119,4.454545454545454
7570245,1,B019C6X1R6,So dumb. Someone paid for people to write so many great reviews. Don't waste your money.,1460592000,2,88,4.5625

Mazing!! Leading actor was lickable in every scene. Plus crazy-sophisticated, complex plot twists. Blow-your-MIND plot twists!

7570253,5,B019C6X1R6,A fascinating insight into a tormented mind well portrayed by Patrick Fluger. PTSD is a serious issue and this story helps to understand the fractured life.,1460419200,2,156,5.038461538461538

8744658,2,B019C6X1R6,"I don't know what to say when it comes to this movie. Except, on Amazon Video to distinct called xray. Which, if you pause the movie et cetera, or even if you use the video application. I..e. Amazon Video. It has this thing that tells you like such things as goose in the movie coma locations. Quotes etcetera. The first red flag for me half way Into ""The Tell-Tale Heart"" besides the fact that it wasn't as good as the trailer made it seem. Was when I paused it, and the trivia slash information popped up on the screen, saying verbatim that rose McGowan to lead actress in the movie, stated that she did not like the way the movie was going at once she sold the trailer, she had no in seeing the film, even after completing it. That during the process of shooting the movie, she did not like how the film was being changed so much to bring the filming process. And that a film like the telltale heart could have been done so much better if they had stuck to the original story. And they change, it is a summed up version. All of that FYI is available on Amazon if you are able to access any of the information in a x ray mode. Or on IMDB..

So that being said, I had marked this only going by the trailer because it was half the price to rent it than it was to buy it and to pay for it dollars for something only get it for 24 hours. And it was already almost 3 or 4 years old. I just decided to double down because I am a huge fan of Rose McGowan,  the trailer presented the film to be so much better than the film actually is. So I figured if I were to run to walmart or buy it online physically, it would be about the same, then it would be just to buy it. So I would give this 2 and a half to 3 stars. But there is no 2 and a half so. Because I did I think the reviews on here are particular. It's not very true to the poor my opinion is most of the people Renoise they are a fan of rose McGowan and thats it. Because the movie is awful the movie the raven if you are an Edgar Allen Poe fan which came if so much better of an adaptation than this story is along with the pit and the pendulum, which came out twice, one I think in the 60s with Vincent price, a one in the late 80s early 90s by empire pictures. Check those out skip this. If you really want to see it and you have the extra money you might like it. I'm not upset that I paid what I paid and didn't like it. And a huge fan of the actors in this movie, especially Rose McGowan. If you are then I recommend buying it to add your collection other than that. Skip it.",1520553600,,2533,3.9069767441860463
8744659,2,B019C6X1R6,"was quite disappointed, very strange adaptation of the original",1477526400,,63,6.111111111111111
8744660,2,B019C6X1R6,Not as original nor would watch again,1472774400,,37,4.428571428571429
8744661,3,B019C6X1R6,"Tell Tale Heart is a modernized take of the Edgar Allen Poe classic of the same name.  An American pilot (Flueger) is captured in the middle east and badly beaten getting a case of PTSD.  Deeply disturbed, he claims an enhanced sensitivity to sound.  Unsure of his sanity he keeps checking himself into a mental institution where this vulture eye on his doctor drives him more nuts.  This movie takes liberties on an American Classic  and runs a big risk because many LOVE THE STORY AS IT IS!.  I got the same feeling while watching the movie version of Steinbeck's American Classic, Cannery Row. No Palace Flop house.  Instead a baseball game. I think changing these classic stories spoils expectations.  I believe in this  case,  the movie makers should adhere to the story line at every turn and straightaway.  This movie blurs the line between what is real and what is not:  a headache to figure.  It uses cartoon animation to take snapshots in the film and I found this blurry.  It's nice to see McGowan again as the mystery woman lurking in the kitchen.  One thing this movie does have is some of the genius prose of Edgar Allen Poe.  It has the same introverted, whispering, troubled tone Poe used in the original story.  I'd give it three stars for that, but if you want classic, read the story.",1468713600,,1303,4.595652173913043

8744663,1,B019C6X1R6,Arrived loose in it's case and all scratched up. Got a refund. Wasn't the one I meant to order anyway. Rose McGowan is horrible no matter her role.,1466467200,,147,4.285714285714286
8744664,3,B019C6X1R6,Very different.  Moves slowly.  Ending is revealing. I found this movie hard to rate.,1464652800,,85,5.0
8744665,1,B019C6X1R6,"The only way this movie is getting great reviews is b/c Rose McGowan herself is leaving all the comments mentioning her as ""sexy,"" ""a great actress"" ""an under-rated actress"" She's obviously writing the reviews herself or paying people to do it b/c this was the worst piece of garbage I've seen in years! Do NOT waste your money...",1462752000,2,330,4.706896551724138

8744667,1,B019C6X1R6,I looked everywhere to cancel this order. Its the most boring movie I have watched in the last few months. I wouldnt have minded if it was a free movie but I paid for it.,1461974400,,170,3.8857142857142857
