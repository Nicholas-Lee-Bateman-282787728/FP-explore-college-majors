499820,1,6302703794,"So fecund, so multi-faceted, and so brimming with scalding tears is the Holocaust that the minute a mediocre movie about it rears its head, it oughta be run out of town.

Lifeless characters, mismanaged tension, and a punch-pulling script all help to make ""The Boat is Full"" the most forgettable film I have ever seen about the Holocaust.

Strictly for completists.",1179360000,,365,4.967213114754099
499821,5,6302703794,"Filmed in Switzerland in 1981, and based on a true story, this film is more than a Holocaust drama.  It deals with courage, humanity, and challenging a country's restrictions.

Six people including four Jews, a German soldier deserter and a young French boy escape Germany and they enter Switzerland for safety - their lives!

They come across an innkeeper, Anna Franz, who instructs the group that Switzerland will take refugees, but they must comply to the restrictions that entail asylum to a family with children under 6.  They formulate a plan to resemble a family.  However, the groups faces one challenging aspect, the youngest boy is French and does not speak German and it is critical that he not speak!

To further the challenges, Judith, who poses as the mother and wife, has her real husband pursuing her as he left a Swiss refugee camp.  Plus, Anna, the innkeeper, is up against her own husband, who is frightened of the mascarade unfolding.

This film is suspenseful and heartening and like any other Holocaust film, it exudes the ultimate sadness.  It was nominated for an Oscar in 1982 for Best Foreign Film.  ......Rizzo

I recommend an amazing Jewish Halocaust film, through the eyes of a teen:

499822,1,6302703794,"The nomination of this film for an Academy Award and the effusive praise of two Amazon reviewers baffle me.  There isn't a single line of dialogue that could be called inspired; the characters are paper-thin; the tone of the movie is unvarying and the pacing  glacial. It would have been enlightening to learn of the Swiss government's true policies with respect to Jewish refugees, but the  stern actions of one policeman can hardly serve as an indictment.",1091491200,6,457,4.909090909090909
499823,5,6302703794,"I was so moved by this movie when I screened it this weekend at the Tribeca Film Festival, I am ordering it to watch again and really soak it up.  There was a Q&A with the director Markus Imhoof directly after the screening, and after hearing what he went through to bring this film to life, and how dedicated he was to telling this story, I can't articulate how wonderful this film is.",1083456000,3,386,4.287671232876712
499824,5,6302703794,"I don't generally write reviews, however, the only other review written for this movie is completely and utterly wrong.  The movie described in the review is most definitely not the award-winning Swiss film ""The Boat is Full"".  This film can be pointed to as the first step towards the acknowledgement of Switzerland's culpability during WWII and the Holocaust.  It follows Jewish refugees who have escaped from Germany into the neutral Swiss country in hopes of a better life, or actually just life in general.  They are accompanied by a deserter from the German army.  They are taken in by a Swiss couple who feeds them and tries to help them stay in the country.  However, it will be a difficult task since Switzerland had stopped allowing Jews to enter the country (and stay) unless they could meet certain, strict criteria.  During the Second World War, the Swiss did accept 30,000 Jewish refugees, however, they also turned away an estimated 30,000 more and knowingly sent them to their deaths back in Germany.  This is not a condemnation of the Swiss people (as the movie portrays many of them did try to help the Jews), however, it is a condemnation of the Swiss government during the war who many times gave aid to Hitler's Nazis, including the selling of gold taken from the teeth of Jewish victims.  Thanks to this film new investigations began and the truth has come to light as to Switzerland's role in the war and, to their credit, the government is seriously trying to make amends for it.  If you are interested in the Holocaust this is a movie for you.  It is in German, Swiss, and French, but the subtitles are very good and it is most definitely worth watching.  It would be perfect to show to a history class to illustrate how some of the greatest harm mankind can do is by doing nothing.",1023235200,50,1807,4.647798742138365
499825,5,6302703794,"Heinz goes to mime school.  He is at the lower end of his class.  When everybody else pretends to be looking at innocent passersby behind glass,and through strong winds, Heinz is least convincing.  Secretly, his anger and frustration build.  He is put in charge of a birthday party for the headmaster,Herr Schwinn Globulusch.  He arranges to entertain everyone on a boat. Food and drink (alcohol) are plenty.  He overhears two drunken classmates make fun of his inadequate mime skills.  His rage cannot be held in check anymore.  He cuts the anchor and destroys the engine, screaming, ""How do you mime death?"" over and over again.  The party remains on the boat for one week.  At the end of the second day, when all the food is gone, the mimes begin to descend into savagery.  The most blood curdling scene is when two mimes try to eat a third.  I highly recommend this film.",1008979200,3,875,4.647058823529412
499866,4,6302703794,"A small film in the big context of the threat of National Socialism. The story follows a group of Jews seeking refuge in Switzerland where they find varying personal responses, inhuman rules the Swiss seem to feel are more important than the humans they apply to, and heartbreak.

The dubbing in English is horrible - better if you just watch with subtitles. There is no boat, so the title was confusing - when were they going to get on the boat? Until I realized it was the boat of life. So awful to find that most of these people died horribly. Are the Swiss portrayed unfairly here? More questions than answers with this one. But I have thought about it and the characters as much as I would if I'd read the book. So 4 stars for that.",1434153600,,559,4.233644859813084

Left one wondering why the Swiss could not have found a far better option than returning Jews to Germany to be gassed rather than to some other country where they could be safe.
I suppose Neutrality, as always, has some negative consequences. To me it shows the futility of trying to sit on the fence when good and evil are clearly seen for what they are.",1419292800,,473,4.511627906976744

499912,5,6302703794,Looking back at history you realize how current events repeat.  The Swiss must have known that every Jewish refugee would go to the gas chambers but neutrality comes with a very expensive price.  There are many places in the world today where people are being brutalized for their religious and personal views.  The United States  could allow everyone to come here too but their are too many.  Our boat is full too. Hopefully the generosity of people will win out and allow more people to get one more day of life in this world.  Great movie and relatively old by our standards.

499939,5,6302703794,"The film tells the story of Swiss locals dealing with Jewish refugees during WWII. It does so with humanity but without becoming overly emotional or graphic - as is often done with this era of movies.
The film was able to present different sides of a difficult situation without the necessity of characterizing any as good or bad overall. As a Jewish American who recently returned from a visit to family in Switzerland, I watched the film to answer questions. The film did so and was well presented too.

499943,5,6302703794,"Knowing that this movie is based on a true story made it all the more compelling, especially because
the villain of the piece, a local policeman, has such utter contempt for the lives thrust into his
control. As the story unfolded, I first resented but then really hated him, even though he was only
carrying out his government's orders. Still, he seems very glad to do so. (I wonder if he, too, is
based on a real-life figure.) The part that truly horrified me came right at the beginning. I won't
spoil the moment for anyone, but those who have seen the film will know what I mean--the older woman
who puts her hat on with an indecipherable expression on her face. Did that part, too, really
happen? What one takes away from the movie, in the end, is a horror not of the sadism involved but of
the blithe attitude with which the sadists operate. There's no passion, no psychopathology. Just...
following orders. One odd note--the old man was played by Curt Bois, whom buffs of old Hollywood
movies recall as a comic character actor. What a change in his resume!",1337299200,,1063,4.541666666666667
499944,4,6302703794,"This is a very interesting film on the incorporation of foreigners into Swiss society, with implications for assimilating immigrants into other European societies. The EU is struggling with increased immigration from Eastern Europe and third world countries and how to incorporate these new arrivals in fairly homogeneous societies. I enjoyed the film's presentation of the challenges faced by poor  immigrants from Italy in trying to adapt to Swiss life, but facing deportation as illegals. The film is probably more relevant to the present day than when it was made. It offers a picture on the issues the U.S. is facing in deciding whether to make illegals citizens or deporting them to their home countries.",1265587200,,710,5.228070175438597
499945,4,6302703794,"I noticed a couple of very negative reviews of ""The Boat is Full"" and I admit that this movie is rather unique.  However, I was very impressed with this film once I had seen it to its' completion.  It lacks any sort of action or compelling characterization.  I was able to watch ""The Boat is Full"" sitting way back in my seat and at no time found myself at the edge of it.  The setting and dialogue could have easily been transposed successfully into an on-stage production.  What makes it so impressive is the glimpse it gives us of the general European apathy to the plight of Jews in Nazi Germany and, specifically, to the plight of refugees.  Years ago I read the book ""While Six Million Died"" which detailed the ""problem"" of Jewish emigrees in the early and middle years of Hitler's Germany.  The basic problem was that nobody wanted them.  (The book underscored America's shameless participation in that apathy).  There is a centuries-old anti-Semitism in Europe that most Americans don't comprehend.  I'm no expert on the subject so I won't attempt to explain nor justify this but we get a sense of it from the various comments heard in ""The Boat is Full"".

We encounter a mixture of refugees who are only looking for a haven from the madness that they left behind in German occupied Europe.  They have made it to Switzerland but that doesn't mean that their ordeal is over.  To counteract the large influx of refugees, Switzerland has its' own set of rules as to who can stay and who gets sent back.  Getting sent back is almost the same as a death sentence which the viewers understand.  The chess game of desperate moves is the essence of the movie.  Kudos to director Marcus Imhoof for giving us a cast of (under the circumstances) everyday characters.  We are not drawn generally to anyone in particular.  These people have their negatives and, in some cases, their postives but there is no genius, beauty, or hero amongst them.  Because of that, we end up assessing the situation without being led along by the script of direction.  We know who's right and who's wrong but the greatness of ""The Boat is Full"" is its' focus on the gray areas.",1197158400,6,2154,4.603674540682415
