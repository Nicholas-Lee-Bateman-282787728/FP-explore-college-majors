8023594,1,B00028G4TG,"When you look at a Miro piece of artwork you are struck by the colors, the crazy shapes and the fun of it all. Where is the fun in this DVD?

To start off there is some person dressed up in a costume with a mask much like the faces Miro painted. This person wanders throughout the film like some sort of mime on acid.

The narrator sounds half asleep and/or pretentious.

The actual film or video stock this was shot on lacks any brightness or sharpness. It's like the quality you get taping over programs on old video cassettes.

Given I love stuff like the two seminal BBC series on art--Simon Schama's ""Power of Art"" and ""Private Life Of A Masterpiece""--I was expecting similar with this. This was done by some New York-based company called V.I.E.W. (are they related to the ""The Man From U.N.C.L.E.""?) and all I can say is they didn't convince me at all with this to go out and check out any more of their art or music DVDs.",1313193600,,928,4.316091954022989
8023595,3,B00028G4TG,"This portrayal of Joan Miro is very theatrical ... a very colorful and I thought informative narrative .. but at times you could not hear the narrative very well or at all because of the loudness of the background, well, foreground music.",1197504000,4,238,4.690476190476191
8023596,1,B00028G4TG,"This DVD was a real disappointment. Except for the interview with Tapies, you do not learn anything about the artist. It's poetic but repetitive. Not even the titles of the paintings shown are mentioned. Do not buy it.",1186963200,6,218,4.7631578947368425
8023597,2,B00028G4TG,"This video was a disappointment.  It has VERY long looks at very few works of art, from one museum.  It leaves out a lot more than it covers, as far as his process, development, and personal information.",1176595200,7,203,4.45945945945946
