2251274,5,B0007Y3Y20,"My son who is 18 yrs old and severely autistic, adhd, bipolar, and adhd just loved this cartoon.  He enjoys the music a lot.",1379980800,2,124,4.166666666666667
2251275,4,B0007Y3Y20,I headline this DVD three out of four because I liked three out of four episodes on this DVD.  The vol 1 DVD include episodes where Pippi first comes to town and all the characters meet her for the first time.  We also have a crooked business man trying to buy Pippi's house from some crooked real estate men even though the place isn't for sale.  like Cruella's De Ville two bumbling partners in 101 Dalmations we have a pair of bumbling crooks  in this series who stars in the third episode but really don't care for them as much. At least not in episode 3 of the series.  The final episode of the disk the  father of Pippi's best friends is tearing down the senior home forcing them seniors to move into an new apartment house against their will so they can no longer be a elderly eye sore on the community. Pippi rally the old age people against this injustice.,1379462400,2,865,4.308641975308642
2251276,5,B0007Y3Y20,What a lovely story for boys and girls.  Pippi is fun to watch and I wish I had all of her energy,1353974400,2,97,3.409090909090909
2251277,5,B0007Y3Y20,"When I was a young girl many years ago, I was fascinated by the stories of Pippi Longstocking's adventures as written by Astrid Lindgren. I also enjoyed watching the older television series featuring Inger Nilsson as Pippi. Here was a fearless young girl with her unique ponytails, embarking on adventures I could only dream of.

I was pleasantly surprised to find the animated version of Pippi Longstocking adapted from the original stories. There are several DVDs in the series and after checking several out from my local library, I found my first grader not only loves the stories but finds them engaging as well. In Here Comes Pippi, there are actually four episodes on the DVD with a running time of approximately 88 minutes total:

Pippi Returns to Villa Villekulla
Pippi Doesn't Sell Her House
Pippi Meets a Master Criminal
Pippi Saves the Old Folks Home

The DVD also features English and French language tracks. There's a Kid Friendly Auto Play with a 10 second countdown to automatically play the entire program from the main menu. The animation is actually quite decent, with vibrant colors and the stories are engaging. There are several other DVDs in the series such as Pippi Goes to the Fair, Pippi's Christmas, and many more. Recommended for ages 4-8.",1321315200,12,1267,4.911214953271028
2251278,5,B0007Y3Y20,"Pippi is a positive, energetic character. The villians are laughable, rather than scary. The plot is about adventures children love, not the usual adult plots put into children's characters. So, if you are tired of children's movies where the story is based on romantic love, or on the mommy or daddy figure being killed, then you would love this DVD. My kids do, and I do too!",1185235200,3,377,4.641791044776119
