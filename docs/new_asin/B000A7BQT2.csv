2377821,4,B000A7BQT2,"The workout start out with a 5 minute warm-up session and you will continue to do a somewhat high intensity aerobics workout for 20 mins and cool down. I've never break into that much of sweat even when I was jogging for 30 minutes but this one really help me to break some sweats at the end of the workout. I find that the work out is fun, Ellen is a great instructor, she speaks and instruct clearly and the workout is not boring for a person who finds anything boring in a week - like me. However, I do have some extra weight I am carrying on right now and having that weight and doing the exercise, kind of hurt my right knee for a while. The hurting gone so bad to the extent that I had to stop doing the exercise for a couple of weeks (advice from the doctor) I read that some people have experienced this too while doing Ellen Barrett's workout and I assumed it must be due to the strenuous lunges and squat PLUS the extra weight we have. I don't think it will hurt as much if you're on your ideal weight and have strong knees but for people with weak knees, you might want to skip the lunges and squats altogether until you're stronger. Overall, it is a fun workout and I definitely see a fitter me after 2 weeks (2 times a week)!",1141862400,5,1238,4.119834710743802
2377822,4,B000A7BQT2,"I bought this DVD solely for Ellen Barrett.  She is great, she cues well, she is motivating, has a pleasant voice and knows her stuff!  The DVD could have been longer and could have been more well-rounded, but all in all, you get a decent, quality workout.  She does a great job with introducing new moves and using repetition for perfecting the form.  I particularly liked the ballet segment.  I use this between my more difficult Janis Saffell DVD's, so it really is enough of a workout.  The bonus could have been longer, but Ellen does suggest that you do it 2-3 times, not just once.  I would have given this 5 stars if it was a longer workout.",1141430400,11,649,4.4033613445378155
2377823,5,B000A7BQT2,"I was not in good shape at all when I started doing this video; I had gained 60 pounds during my pregnancy (my daughter is 18 mos. now) and just could not seem to get rid of these last 10 pounds.  I watched this video once and thought ""No problem,"" but the first time I tried it I had to stop after the 1st ten minutes!

I've been doing it consistently (4x p/wk) since just before Christmas, and I've lost 7 pounds and am back into clothes I haven't fit into since before I got married!

Some of these reviews say that the 40 minutes of high intensity cardio is too easy or short, but they must all be Miss Fitness America or something!  After 2 months of doing this workout 4x p/wk I am only just now getting to where I can do it all the way through without getting out of breath or too sweaty.

Here's the bottom line: this workout produces serious results in the time promised.  If you are consistent and stick with it, as well as making healthy eating choices, you WILL see results.  The instructor is very engaging, and makes it - believe it or not - fun!  The moves are such that you hardly notice the time passing.  I highly recommend it.",1140220800,26,1145,4.191780821917808
2377824,4,B000A7BQT2,"The instructor Ellen Barrett is one of my favorite instructors & had a lot to do w/why I purchased this DVD as opposed to something else.  She does a good job w/this workout by incorporating different moves into each section that work the entire body.  The beach background is beautiful & makes me wish I were there.  My only complaint w/this workout is that there is no ab workouts (other than the side imprint in the ballet section) & in the strength section, there is no triceps focus. If you do the total body bonus, you do get a brief workout to these sections, but the bonus is very short.",1137542400,7,595,4.390909090909091
2377825,4,B000A7BQT2,"This workout features Ellen Barrett, who is best known for the Crunch Pilates workouts (Pick Your Spot, Fat Burning and Burn & Firm).  She also appears in Self Bikini Ready Fast.  She leads you through this 35 minute workout and is joined by 2 background exercisers, one who shows lower impact modifications.  All you will need for this video is a set of light weights (2-5 lbs).  The setting on a beach in Mexico which is very nice.

The workout is split up into several segments, the first being a simple warmup consisting of marches, step touches, mambos and squats.  Then you will move into the next segment which is the ballet series.  Not to difficult, Ellen will take you through a series of ballet moves such as center plies, calf lifts, tiptoe plies (center plie with heels lifted), standing oblique work (imprints), and rear leg extensions.  She will repeat the series a couple times with less reps and adding some moves such as a scoop move where is looks like you are gathering flowers, and a swirl move that targets the obliques a bit.  I really liked this segment, it brings out the graceful side in me.

The next 2 segments are cardio, fun simple combinations with some higher impact moves to elevate the heartrate.  But you could also follow the modifier who shows all low impact options.  The first combination consists of march ups, jacks, heel digs, knee lifts, v-steps, skier squats, and shuffles.  The sequence is repeated a few times.  The second combination consists of step kicks, v-steps, jumpropes, 1 leg plyo jumps, jump squats, side to side jumropes, march up/back or bunny hops back, double jacks and one legged hops.  Again this series is repeated a few times and power moves are added if you like.

The next segment is toning work with light weights.  You start with bicep curls then you will add a reverse lunge, then side squats with side deltoid lifts, then you will stand in place for a move that works the shoulders more, it's like a side lateral raise but you raise your arms up with palms up and lower them down with palms down.  You will repeat this a few times, this time adding a knee raise to the bicep/reverse lunge and a inner thigh sqeeze to the side squat/side deltoid lift, after the inner thigh squeeze, you will stay standing and add some outer thigh and rear leg lifts.  Towards the end you will do a longer set of the bicep/lunges and side squat/deltoid lifts alternating them before the cooldown.

Overall this isn't a bad workout, I really liked the cardio segments and the ballet series, the toning series was just okay for me though.  I didn't really get much out of it.  Therefore this would be a good workout for lighter days or for those who are beginner/intermediate levels, or if you are just looking to tone up.  Ellen as always does a nice job as the lead.

There is a brief bonus workout, Total Body Turnaround which consist of more toning work which would be a nice add-on for those looking for more toning.  The segment itself is only 5 minutes or so long and consists of more moves done in combination such as side lateral raises while balancing on one leg, triceps extensions while doing static lunges, and biceps curls while in plie squat position.  There is also some brief floorwork, inner thigh lifts and oblique work before finishing out with a rowing exercise which targets the abs, arms and back) and a seated boxing exercise which works the arms and abs.  You will need your light weights and a mat for this segment.",1136937600,107,3491,4.606796116504855
2377826,5,B000A7BQT2,"Cons:

The previews to the workout, I am working out not waiting for a movie, luckily you can forward it

There is one girl on the workout with a unsettling, Barbie-ish, smile

Sometimes you wonder who chose the music

Pros:

I love the girl who guides you through the workout, she is wonderful and not annoying.

If you pre-watch your videos before doing them do not be fooled into thinking this will be easy because you will be sore the next day!

The tips at the end of the work out were a very nice addition

I would recommend this video, I think it is great, especially for lower body, those squats add up!",1136851200,2,611,4.298245614035087
2377827,5,B000A7BQT2,"I am extremely happy with this workout! The moves are graceful, and I love that. But don't be fooled, you WILL feel it the next day if you are an intermediate/somewhat advanced like me.  Ellen is a wonderful instructor, with better instruction than many.  I have done this several times now, and at the end during the weight segment I keep thinking... ONE MORE SET???  However, it feels so good to finish strong, and it is only 35 minuts long so keep with it and give it your all!",1130976000,30,480,4.370786516853933
2377828,4,B000A7BQT2,"This is a reasonably good workout.  It's not really instructed as well as others I have seen.  For example, Ellen Barrett doesn't tell you about proper form etc, so you may do things incorrectly and possibly lead to injury.  Having said that, this workout is designed to quickly burn fat and reshape your body and it will if you do it often.  The scenery is beautiful again (shot in same location as her last workout).  The dvd includes a 5-minute upper and lower-body ""bonus"" segment. You will need some dumbells for this routine.  She will keep you motivated, just keep yourself safe while using your know how from other workouts, and incorporate that into this.",1130457600,44,664,4.730434782608696
2377829,5,B000A7BQT2,"This was a very well produced and challenging workout. Ellen Barrett is by far one of my favorite instructors and she does an excellent job (as usual) cueing and providing a variety of effective and fun exercises. I've also tried her Self: Bikini Ready Fast dvd and would say that it is less challenging (but still great) than this workout. It would be good to have both dvd's in your rotation, one for those lighter days, and this one for more of a challenge. Good job Self and Ellen!!",1130198400,25,486,4.47191011235955
2377833,5,B000A7BQT2,I love this Dvd. Rented it first and then decided to own. Its easy enough that I enjoy doing it but find myself sweating and feeling accomplished when I am done,1334188800,,160,4.193548387096774
2377834,4,B000A7BQT2,"It's a good one. Makes you sweat, I liked that some ballet moves were incorporated. It is low impact most of the time.",1324684800,,118,4.173913043478261
2377835,5,B000A7BQT2,Like it alot! I am moderately active and found this video challenging enough that it raises my heart rate. It is fast- paced and varied. Add weights to build strength.,1318550400,,167,4.6
2377836,5,B000A7BQT2,"I've been doing this work out for about 6 months now and I love it.  It has a little bit of everything...ballet, aerobics, strength training, some mat work.  It may not be challenging enough for some more advanced work out enthusiasts but it's great for a ""I have to push myself to to a light workout today"" kind of day!  Very easy to follow...Ellen is not annoying.  Definitely recommend it for all but the highest fitness level exercisers.",1316908800,,441,4.615384615384615
2377837,5,B000A7BQT2,This video is great because it offers challenging cardio but it's not so hard were you will want to pass out like a lot of aerobic DVDs I have used in the past. Plus the weight lifting at the end is challenging too but not hard. There is a moderator in the DVD for beginners which is great. Overall this DVD is geat!,1305849600,,316,4.031746031746032
2377838,5,B000A7BQT2,"One of my favorite Ellen Barrett fitness DVDs. This workout is almost entire aerobics, with a brief toning segment at the end.",1280188800,,126,4.7727272727272725
2377839,3,B000A7BQT2,"This is the first workout from Self magazine that I've tried, and I have to say I was disappointed that it wasn't as high-intensity as I would have liked it to be.  This workout seems geared more towards beginner-to-intermediate exercisers.

The good:

--The moves were simple and easy to follow
--The scenery is beautiful; I wished I could have worked out with them on that beach!
--The toning segments are slow and controlled, which was nice.

What needs improvement:

--The cardio segments barely got my heart rate up.  When she said she was switching to high intensity, I was happy; however, she doesn't do these moves often enough to really give you a good cardio workout if you are an advanced exerciser.
--Again, the toning segments could have been amped up more for the advanced exerciser.
--The bonus segment (more toning) could have been longer than 5 minutes.
--The cueing could have been a bit better; I was constantly caught off guard with the abrupt changes.

Overall, I felt like I did a 45-minute warmup.  After I was done with this workout, I had to pop in a Jillian Michaels DVD (30 day shred) to feel like I actually got an intense workout.  I just thought it worth noting that a 25-minute Jillian Michaels workout kicked my butt, and my 45 minutes spent doing this workout felt like a really long warmup.

This is a solid workout for a beginner, but if you're an advanced exerciser who likes to be pushed and challenged, look elsewhere.",1243382400,,1456,4.674509803921569
2377840,3,B000A7BQT2,"The best part of this video is Ellen Barret, she's a motivating instructor, with a calm personality. This is an easy ballet/pilates video with minimal cardio. My heart rate was around 50-60% of maximum - better than walking, but not much. Some of the cardio is kickboxing-inspired. It's a good beginner workout with easy intervals, basic lunges/biceps strength moves, and a pretty outdoor scene. The girls following Ellen are very robotic, no facial movements at all.",1236729600,,467,5.157894736842105
2377841,4,B000A7BQT2,I selected this dvd because I've enjoyed the other SELF dvd's and this one didn't disappoint. It starts out with a great warm up and dance inspired moves then moves into 2 high engery segments that make you sweat. I would recommend this dvd to everyone because I've made it a part of my regular routine.,1233014400,,303,4.428571428571429
2377842,5,B000A7BQT2,"I really enjoy this workout, and although it never feels too difficult, am very sweaty and ""worked-out"" feeling by the end! I'm definitely going to look for more of Ellen's workouts! The moves are by turns graceful and energetic, and the weight section at the end is slower and more focused than in many other workouts, which I really like. I'm using a streaming online version from Netflix, which doesn't include the bonus workout, so I'm planning to buy my own copy from Amazon.",1232496000,,480,4.726190476190476
2377843,5,B000A7BQT2,This is one of my favorite workout DVDs. It is challenging for me and there have been times when I had to stop and take a break (other people on here might be in slightly better shape than me though so keep that in mind). But I love how Ellen Barrett is positive and uplifting without being too annoying (Ahem...Denise Austin...).,1216684800,2,330,4.426229508196721
2377844,5,B000A7BQT2,"This is a good workout with an instructor who looks healthy, not like a stick insect.  She cues well and the music is upbeat. It has enough repetition so that it is easy to follow, but not boring.

What is really nice is the bonus workout. It only lasts a little over five minutes, yet still manages to work most of the body with compound moves.  Once you get the hang of it, you can go a bit heavier on the weights than what she recommends, and while she's explaining the moves, you can get in a few extra reps, or do half the number of reps, but in slow motion.",1215561600,,563,4.054054054054054
2377845,4,B000A7BQT2,"Good DVD for beginners. They give an option of a low impact or high impact workout, which is nice.",1209686400,,98,4.2105263157894735
2377846,4,B000A7BQT2,"This self video workout is much more focused on legs.  I really enjoyed it and after you do it a couple of times you can feel it for sure.  I like the Bikini Ready fast better, but this one is pretty good too.",1209340800,,209,3.8372093023255816
2377847,4,B000A7BQT2,"After being a gym rat (cardio bunny!) for five years straight, I decided it was time for a change of pace.  I wanted a DVD I could pop in at home and do on the days I didn't feel like heading to the gym- one that would get my heart rate up, burn some calories, and make me feel like I had accomplished something.

This workout DVD does just that.  The moves don't seem that hard, but it really makes me sweat.  As a beginner to workout DVD's (with two left feet), I could still follow along easily.  Ellen Barrett is a great instructor- she's enthusiastic without being annoying, and her cues are very easy to follow.

The DVD is broken up into various segments, including a ""ballet themed interval"" (which is fun and different), two cardio segments (both are very repetitive, but really get the heart rate going), and a weight segment (which is challenging but too brief).

The repetitiveness of the cardio segments is why I gave this DVD four stars instead of five.  It is a VERY repetitive workout.  It was fun the first two or three times I did it- but now that I've owned the DVD for awhile, I find myself only pulling this one out maybe once every three to four weeks.  I've found other workout DVD's that are much more interesting and engaging, and so unfortunately this DVD finds itself on the shelf most days.

When I say that this DVD is great for ""beginners"", I do mean those of us that have aren't new to exercise but are new to workout DVD's.  I do think a beginner to exercise could still find some merit in this workout, but it would be challenging.

But for a good, easy, mindless workout that will make you sweat...this is a solid DVD to own.",1199836800,6,1659,4.347402597402597

2377872,4,B000A7BQT2,"I rely heavily on reviews when I buy something, so I figured I'd add my two cents in here.  This is a basic workout.  Nothing too fancy, no advanced moves, but you will feel it.

This is not the DVD you do every day, but it's great to have in your library.  I like the mix of cardio and weights.  Ellen does call things by their ""ballet names"" which can be confusing at first (like I know what a side imprint is?), but once you get over that, it's fine.  Also, unlike some instructors I've seen, Ellen is not annoying.  To me, that's huge.  One of the Firm instructors drives me crazy and I can't do her tapes at all!

I would like it better if there was a clearer basic vs. advanced, so you could start out at one point with the DVD and progress to something more difficult, but I guess that's why you have more than one DVD in your collection!",1181174400,9,845,4.103658536585366
2377873,5,B000A7BQT2,"This dvd is perfect for beginners.  It is repetitive so if you are concerned about not being able to follow or keep up of with the routine then this dvd is for you.  One of the girls demonstrates a low impact version of the work out, which is nice for heavier people or people with weak muscles or joints.  I love the ocean view on this dvd.  It's refreshing.

I agree that the sound is a little muffled, but it's not bad.

 I can see how intermediates would become annoyed with this dvd.  It is on the simpler side, but not so simple if you are just starting out.  If you are a beginner, I highly recommend you buy or check out this dvd from your local library.",1175212800,6,662,4.109375

It also pains me to see these fair skinned girls squinting in the sun on a beach as they work up a sweat.  I think the producers thought this would somehow be soothing, but it drives me crazy.

Furthermore, I did not enjoy the Conde Nast advertising.  ick.

This is a challenging workout, I sweat like crazy, but it does get incredibly repetitive. The sound quality isn't all that great either, Ellen's voice is kind of muffled,  and one of the girls in the video doesn't stop grinning, which I found to be incredibly annoying.

She's not cheesy like most workout divas. Her work out are great too- I always work up a sweat and I'm definately stronger since doing her routines. Slim and sleek which is more leg focused,as opposed to Bikini Ready Fast which feels more focused on the arms, though each part of the body is worked hard.

plus- its set on a beach in Mexico and makes a hard workout seem relaxing.

Like some other reviewers, I thought that the workout would benefit from more instruction on proper form.

Overall, however, it's a worthwhile workout for me (beginner/intermediate) and I definitely broke a sweat. For serious muscle toning, I will continue to count on The Firm since this DVD doesn't allow you to ""heavy up"".",1156809600,8,581,4.918367346938775

As a newbie to this type of choreographed cardio workout, I think part of the problem may be the challenge of coordinating everything to move the right way at the right time.  The cardio dance moves aren't broken down into step by step sequences, so I find I have to pause the DVD, practice trying to move appropriately, then resume watching the DVD until I hit another snag.  Someone with more experience would probably find this workout fun rather than disheartening.

2377904,5,B000A7BQT2,"For those of you that you can stand 35-45 minutes of up-tempo cardio without breaking a sweat than you may want a more advanced dvd. For those of you that are starting a new workout or for beginners, I would recommend this dvd. I felt the burn for 3 days, especially in my thighs and butt, which I personally am most happy about. I am not perfectly in shape, nor am I extremely out of shape. The dvd has a nice warm up with marching exercises and then up-tempos to include plenty of lunges, kicks, reaches, jump-roping in place etc. You do not stop moving until the Session is over. I had to stop a few times for a minute, but I continued to march in place while I had to stop, to be sure to keep my heart rate up. This dvd is perfect for a great cardio workout, with some killer thigh and butt exercises. I felt great after following the routine and I can tell that if I stick to it, I will see a difference. I recommend this to all you Beginner-Intermediate cardio/ strengthing seekers. By the way she does use a set of 2-5 lb free weights toward the end of the workout, which I didn't know at first, so I improvised with big water bottles until I could get some free weights. You can still do the routine without the weights, but the weights help to shape your arms. If I had used free-weights, I probably would have felt a lot more in my arms. All in all it was a great workout.",1151798400,7,1382,4.141263940520446
2377905,3,B000A7BQT2,"I bought this DVD together with Self's Bikini Ready Fast. I would recommend this workout only to beginners, it's really too easy and not nearly long enough (only 35 min. of actual workout including warm-up and cool-down)if you've been working out for awhile. That being said, it is a great workout for beginners or someone who hasn't worked out in a while. It helped me get back in shape (along with Bikini Ready) enough to transition back to The Firm (the best DVD workout as far as I'm concerned). Hope that's helpful.",1147132800,,520,4.663043478260869
2377906,4,B000A7BQT2,"This is a great workout.  It's only 35 minutes long but I can always feel it in my [...]and thighs the next day.  I am definitely not a 'jump-up-and-down-and-say-yeah' aerobics person but this is a great exception.  Ellen Barrett cues very well and she's enthusiastic (using the word 'beautiful!' quite liberally) but she's not annoying.  The setting is gorgeous and the music doesn't dominate over Barret's cues.  Also, the girl with dark hair is so consistently high-energy that it's motivating- I don't think I've ever seen anyone smile so much.

This is a great workout though it is brief (why I didn't give it full 5 stars).  This is good because you feel like you zip through it quickly, but I think I'd get more out of it if it was longer (there's an obviously relationship here).  But who knows- I break a sweat doing it so maybe if it was longer it would be overwhelming.  In summary, this is great and highly recommended- I love it.",1147046400,2,942,4.592814371257485
2377907,5,B000A7BQT2,"This workout video is one of my favorites I have ever tried!  I have been going to the gym over the past year and seem to get very bored with doing cardio on the machines, plus I haven't seen much results because I don't have anyone motivating me while I work out, plus I feel lost with all of the various weight machines and such.  Once I came across this video and read the reviews, I decided to purchase it, and boy am I glad that I did!  I have been doing it for two weeks now, about 3 times a week.  I DEFINITELY feel the burn!!  Even when I'm sooo tired after work, if I come home and pop in this DVD by the time I am done I feel very energized.  It really makes you work up a sweat and you feel the burn in your muscles the next day.  It is enjoyable because the instructor is easy to follow and keeps you focused while working out to this video.  I also love the helpful tips at the end of the workout.  Overall, it has certainly earned its 5 stars!!",1146700800,2,958,3.9479166666666665
2377908,4,B000A7BQT2,"I really enjoyed this workout!  Its quick (just over 30 minute) but I really felt like a got a total body workout!  I love the variety in the routine, such as the use of ballet inspired moves.  While it may not be good for those who are really advanced, this is a great workout for beginners and intermediates!  Keep up the good work Self!",1145318400,,339,4.25
2377909,5,B000A7BQT2,"This is a great workout. I felt like I really burned some calories.  The moves are simple, but effective.  I would recommend this to a beginner or a more advanced person.",1145145600,,170,4.451612903225806
2377910,4,B000A7BQT2,"I really enjoy the cardio in this workout. It really works up a good sweat.  I usually do the cardio and the total body turnaround.  The toning section is very challenging, but only works biceps and shoulders.  It seems like too much to me.  I prefer more variety when toning upper body.  Altogether, I think its a great workout.  I workout with several different videos and try to fit this one in atleast once a week.  This is the only video with Ellen Barrett that I have and she does a great job cueing.  I am very interested in working out with more of her videos.",1143331200,2,568,4.2924528301886795
2377911,4,B000A7BQT2,"I bought this video based on what others had to say about it and I must agree that this is one of the best workout videos I have. It will definately get your heart rate up and you will definately be sweating by the end. The instructor is fun and motivating, not annoying. I would definately reccomend this video.",1142899200,3,312,4.305084745762712
8075618,5,B000A7BQT2,"I love Ellen Barrett.  I had a trial of this workout on cable on demand channel.  I loved the workout so much, I had to own it!",1447200000,,127,3.6666666666666665
8075619,5,B000A7BQT2,"Don't be fooled when you start the warm-up-you'll be ""dying"" in a few minutes.  Great workout that offers both low-impact and high-impact options.  It's tough but worth it-your thighs will kill you and some of the moves will take practice to perfect but you'll be so proud of yourself when you do!!",1447113600,,298,4.711538461538462
8075620,1,B000A7BQT2,"This could have been a fun workout if the camera work and editing weren't so annoying. I couldn't follow it, not because Ellen's directions are hard to follow, but because every time she changed moves the camera was zoomed in on one of the models faces and that was where it stayed for a great deal of the DVD. I lost interest in it after about 20 minutes so I can't swear the whole thing was like that but I can't imagine it changed much. I would be a lot more upset if I had paid more than a few bucks for this. I have several of Ellen's other DVDs and really enjoy them but I won't be trying this one again.",1399420800,2,610,4.008196721311475
8075621,5,B000A7BQT2,"This workout is great for me. It doesn't help me to lose weight, but I lose inches and it tones my muscles. If you're looking to tone, then this is a great workout.",1395619200,,164,4.0
8075622,2,B000A7BQT2,"I remember trying this workout back when Netflix still streamed a wide array of fitness and felt it challenged me a little, although not much. Coming back as an intermediate exerciser a few years later, and I regret purchasing the DVD. For me, there was little challenge and the repetitive exercises were boring. I felt like I spent as much time doing step touch movements as anything that would really work my body.

It might serve as a nice challenge for those who are new to exercise or have limitations that prevent higher intensity workouts, but if you're not a beginner you might not get much out this video. As an aside, the audio quality is terrible.",1394755200,,658,4.6239316239316235
8075623,4,B000A7BQT2,"This is not an intense workout but it is diverse, easy to follow, the trainer and music are not obnoxious, and it was a nice pick me up in my routine at the time.  I used it on light days when I needed to move but just couldn't get into anything too vigorous.  Plus, self is all about moderation in diet, exercise, and all other health matters so I love supporting the brand.",1391817600,,375,4.123287671232877
8075624,3,B000A7BQT2,Pretty good workout. Get ready to sweat. The instructor is great and easy to follow. It works with a change in diet as well.,1386201600,,124,4.208333333333333
8075625,5,B000A7BQT2,This is on my regular Ellen workout rotation.  I like it because it is great cardio.  Plus it is done on the beach with nice music and Ellen's cheerful voice...makes for a fun workout!,1375401600,,184,4.382352941176471
8075626,4,B000A7BQT2,"If you are a hardcore athlete, then this might not be the best work out for you. If you are a beginner to intermediate then it is perfect. it starts slow with a ballet series, then up tempo with a cardio series, ending with strength training. It is perfect for a day's workout. Ellen is upbeat and is great at keeping you motivated without a bunch of annoying hyper mumbo jumbo like some female trainers.",1367798400,,404,4.4
8075627,2,B000A7BQT2,"Why I don't like this video:
1) Ellen Barrett doesn't explain the proper forms
2) The model on the cover isn't the one in the exercise video (that bothers me, like they lied or something and she's in better shape than anyone in the video)
3) Its 45 minutes long and I generally like 30 minute workouts. It could have been organized in better increments.
4) The girl on the left of Ellen Barrett has a forced fake smile throughout the video. You can see her on the back of the dvd cover. Scary.
5) Ellen Barrett is not very personable
6) A lot of the moves do not have smooth transitions
7) She doesn't give you time to learn the move. She just starts doing it without telling you how.
8) This video is obsessed with HOPPING. Yes, they LOVE TO HOP in this video. And i hate hopping.

For all these reasons, I will probably
1) Throw away the dvd
2) Donate the dvd",1347321600,4,861,4.186746987951807
