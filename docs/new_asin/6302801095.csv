514216,5,6302801095,"'Gates of Heaven' is a film by Errol Morris that deals with an ambitious pet cemetery in California.  What makes this documentary so facinating has nothing to do with the actual animals, but rather the people who love and care for them.  As the film progresses, one will realize it is actually a study of human nature and psychology. With the central focus of giving pets a secure resting place, the film incredibly shows human frailty, ambition, and sadness.
For those who have never had pets, this film can be hard to relate to.  My family has never owned any pets, but I've had friends who have had pets.  They are very attached to the pets,  and the pets are like family memebers.  One has to watch this movie with an open heart, or they will never understand the feelings of the people in this documentary.  To some of these people, a pet is more of a friend than a human being will ever be, and there is some real truth behind that.
People might get different interpertations of what Morris is trying to show here.  To me, 'Gates of Heaven' uses the pet cemetary business as a backdrop to show a much deeper aspects of human nature.",1085443200,10,1138,4.4375
514217,5,6302801095,"Here's what is amazing about Gates of Heaven: Two completely different people could watch it and both enjoy it from different perspectives. For one, this could be a heartwarming, courageous tale about dedicated pet-owners and their struggle to build pet cemeteries. For another, this could be simply a hilarious look at human nature and its peculiar quirks and tendencies.
Errol Morris knew he was getting more than information about pet cemeteries when filming Gates of Heaven; he was capturing real, sincere moments by people possessing all kinds of characteristics. Sadness, cynicism, laughter, envy, and the unflinching love for pets is present throughout Gates of Heaven. This film isn't really a documentary about pet cemeteries at all. Rather, it is about human beings, the passions we have, and how we achieve them in this life. Near the end of the film as I watched a young hippie cemetery owner playing his guitar up in the hills, I realized how far this film was reaching for, and how successful it was in reaching it.
From the jealousy of a man towards his younger, more successful brother, to the hilarious (and somewhat sad) monologue by a lonely old woman, Gates of Heaven ultimately shows that no matter what people strive to achieve, whether it be pet cemeteries or President of the United States, it's their heart and souls that will remain timeless.",1061596800,37,1368,4.978165938864628
514218,2,6302801095,"I found Gates of Heaven to be boring. In a nutshell, the movie shows that some people love their pets more than their human relatives. This observation is not an exciting new discovery. ...",1048291200,6,189,4.588235294117647
514219,5,6302801095,"I read positive reviews of Gates of Heaven on Roger Ebert's website (he calls it one of the ten best movies of all time), and I got a video store copy in excellent condition from a friendly retailer on Amazon Marketplace. It really is one of the greatest movies ever made! Gates of Heaven tells the sometimes hilarious but always poignant story of a pet cemetery in Southern California which went bankrupt. As a result, 450 dead animals had to be dug up and relocated in a more prosperous cemetery, the Bubbling Well Pet Memorial Park. Errol Morris interviews the people involved with the first pet cemetery, an old woman named Florence Rasmussen who compares the love given by pets with her ungrateful grandson, and the Harberts family, who own Bubbling Well. All these people have something to say about how humans attach themselves emotionally to animals, about success or failure in their careers and personal lives, and how pet animals seem to give the unconditional love all humans need, but which so few humans seem willing to give their fellow humans. Leonard Maltin described this film as ""An allegory about the absurdity of American priorities."" I can see what he means: Why do we spend so much money on pet food while millions of humans go hungry every day in America? Why do we eat some animals while making others our pets? Animals make great companions and can foster tremendous emotional attachment, but are they really worth the kinds of expensive funerals shown in this movie? Regardless of your feelings about animals, Gates of Heaven (unrelated to the disastrous Heaven's Gate) is the sort of movie that raises questions like those above. By all means rent or buy this movie!",1023408000,6,1694,4.824742268041237
514220,5,6302801095,"In one of Errol Morris' first films, the master of interview via the interratron (unique v ideo monitor setup whereby interviewees look themselves in the eye) captures unbelievably strange, and unquestionably real moments from a wide range of people.  Centering upon a pet cemetary, Morris investigates attitudes and lifestyles surrounding our relationships with animals and inevitably, each other.  Best known for the pivotal film ""The Thin Blue Line"" which resulted in the exoneration of Texas death row in mate Randall Adams  from murder charges , other equally remarkable films by Morris include ""Vernon, Florida"" (originally intended to be a documentary on ""nubbies,"" or folks who commit insurance fraud via self mutilation-abandoned when crew members were nearly run down by the ""king of the nubbies""), and the more recent ""Fast, Cheap and out of Control.""

It's a shame and a sham that this film is out-of-print, let alone not the subject of a Criterion DVD. It's difficult to explain just what is so triumphant and beautiful about Morris' films, this one being his best. You could say, ""Well, it's these people he finds,"" and you'd be right but not really hitting it on the head. He somehow does better than anyone else what you must do to create compelling ""true stories"" - you must get your subjects to reveal themselves completely, to speak for the camera from their heart-of-hearts.  This movie is ""about"" people who have a passion for their pets, especially the final resting places of their pets. But Morris' camera, within that framework, records an unfolding of universal truths. You can't buy this great movie from Amazon - but your local Blockbuster probably has it. So, as soon as you can, head next door to your local independent video store and rent it. In fact, you should probably hook up a second VCR and rip it for yourself.

GATES OF HEAVEN: It's two documentaries in one, and both are totally engrossing. On the surface, it's the story of two pet cemeteries, and a touching tale of peoples' love of their pets--a love that is often taken to extremes and sometimes carried overboard. Merely by presenting a sequence of pet headstones, for instance, Morris draws a fine line of quiet irony, forcing us to ask, Is this dignity or depravity?

The Harberts family, as an example, owners of the Bubbling Wells Pet Memorial Park, north of San Francisco in Napa Valley's wine country, operate their own chapel and incorporated religion, the first tenant of which is that their Supreme Being is not ""species-centric,"" and doesn't differentiate among living beings or limit his compassion just to humans. (I'm reminded of a news story I heard on the radio long before I ever saw this film: Land speculators in Japan were attempting to buy a Buddhist pet cemetery--which was, they believed, an almost criminal waste of real estate on that tiny island--in order to build a high-rise apartment on the site. But the Buddhist caretaker was determined to fight for the spiritual rights of his deceased charges, stating with perfect Zen wisdom that ""Even a fishhead can become a god."" As Pee-Wee Herman would say, ""I love that story!"")

Watched more closely, however, we begin to glean that this apparently simple film is barely about pets at all, but uses pets as a metaphor--as an excuse to deliver a philosophical (and psychological) treatise on human relationships, familial relations, on business and pleasure, on hopes and fears, dreams and reality, change, grief, and--above all--love. The pivotal interview that ties the two topics together and illustrates this point is with an old woman who begins talking about her pets but inevitably ends up venomously denouncing her good-for-nothing, no-account, deadbeat, white trash grandson, who she raised from birth as if she was his own mother; who she'd loaned money to buy a car and who now never visits or drives her anywhere; who... but you'll get the picture.

Once beyond the surface story of the pet cemetery, the film becomes a study of the three male members of the Harberts family. Despite their radically different personalities (daddy Cal is the tough patriarch; older son Phil is a Type-A ""motivation expert""; younger son Danny a forlorn hippie who never made it with his music) all three exude the desperate stench of failure, and generally give the impression that each is grasping at any small straw of success, trying to make his own loopy view of life apply to successful business management. Beneath their thin demeanor of calm sincerity, the camera captures the subtle undercurrents of panic and despair. They know this is their last chance at the American Dream, and they know in their bones they'd better damn well take it seriously. They all look lonely, unloved and unhappy. They are obviously no ones' pets.

With the apparent effortlessness of a seasoned storyteller and the misdirection of a master magician, Morris mesmerizes us and manipulates our emotions so insidiously that we're run through the full range of feelings before we even realize that we've been caught with our guard down. With just the subtlest of switches, the film can break us up with laughter one moment and break our hearts in the next. More than just another movie, ""Gates of Heaven"" is an emotional experience: It is humanly impossible not to be touched, amused and disturbed by this quirky, subversive, poignant, understated and overlooked little gem.",1422489600,,3826,4.9625585023400935
514358,4,6302801095,"Gates of Heaven is a series of interviews beginning with a failed pet cemetery owner and journeys into the world of a successful pet cemetery owner. Along the way, through many voices, Morris examines life and our existence on earth with our beloved pets and the reverence shown when one of those pets passes away. The subtle nuances of the characters and the gentle cadence of the film is very thoughtful and fascinating. If you are not an intellectual person fascinated with character and the human spirit this film with bore you to tears. For me, it was an absolute joy and I found myself enamored with each individual's fashion (70's was great!), social status and way of speaking.",1421971200,,685,4.764705882352941

I found out about this movie from watching the Roger Ebert documentary ""Life Itself,"" in which Ebert was said to have VERY heavily praised this movie.  Figuring this to be some sort of relatively unknown, but heavily philosophical and meaningful, documentary, I HAD to check it out, of course.  What I found was disappointing to me.  It's not a bad movie, just nothing special, in my opinion.  There are indeed some moments I'll probably remember, for being funny or philosophical.  They are just some passing moments though.  I like Roger Ebert, and I wouldn't call this a bad film, but, in my opinion, I would not call this anywhere near one of the top films I've ever seen, and I simply must have missed whatever Roger Ebert saw in the film.",1405209600,3,792,4.695652173913044

514407,5,6302801095,"Roger Ebert once called this movie a masterpiece and called it one of the top ten movies of all time.  With such a glowing review from such a respected critic, I decided to give it a shot.

At first, it comes across as quite boring actually.  So, thinking about Ebert's review I chose to pay closer attention.  What I finally decided was that the movie was dealing with how people dealt with the death of a loved one.  These are all real opinions and real personalities.  And, it shows the extent people are willing to go to to defend and honor something that they love.  It is impressive once you realize what you are watching and choose to pay attention.

I don't think I would have put as much effort into it had Ebert not given that review.  But, I guess I'm grateful that he did.

Does God exist?  Is life eternal?  This movie, in a very deceptive and furtive manner, seemingly, but not really tongue in cheek, worms its way into the debate.  Perhaps it's the seeming humor and seeming over-the-top devotion these owners have for their pets that can get people who normally would consider themselves as atheists, to at least pay attention long enough to feel the owner's love and faith that something will happen after we die.  And, once you've felt it, it's hard to not make it your own opinion as well.

What DID make it move?

And then, many will realize, that if all of this is how people can feel just about a few animals, how much more can this be applied to humans?  That's when it hits you.  This movie isn't silly, AT ALL.  It isn't quaint at all.  It isn't superficial or kitschish at all.  And the one thing it really isn't, is a movie director's attempt to look at a bunch of country yokels and laugh at them.  It is a full blown attempt to show the value of life, even the smallest and most insignificant, and IMHO, to show that there is an afterlife.

I think I agree with Roger Ebert.  This movie is deep and tricky.",1398384000,,1936,4.343575418994414
514408,5,6302801095,"Upon the passing of Roger Ebert last Thursday, I could not help but think of the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gates-of-Heaven/dp/B00094AS6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gates of Heaven</a>&nbsp;by Errol Morris.  There is no need to review it here.  But it occurs to me, and is my personal opinion, that for those of us who have known Roger as a public figure, from his writings, television shows, or interviews and lectures (e.g. at Ebertfest and other occasions), and who feel a wish to be close to him in some way at this time, one could do worse than to obtain, or dust off, a copy of Gates of Heaven and view it.  Roger has been steadfast in his expression of admiration and affection for this movie (see his website), and took every opportunity to suggest that people watch it.  For those who have never seen it, don't let the subject matter, pet cemeteries, mislead you into thinking it would be inappropriate.  In its unprepossessing way, the movie explores life, death, love, and the bitter sweetness of existence: its transience, its mystery, and its irony.  I believe, and again it is my personal opinion, that Roger would be happy to know that people were watching Gates of Heaven, and sharing the feelings that the movie so strongly evoked in his own spirit.
 Disclaimer:  If the above seems presumptuous, I can only apologize.  From personal experience, I know that the movie is not to everyone's taste.

My earliest introduction to his work was ""Vernon Florida"", which blew me away with its technique, but also because it helped my understanding and appreciation of this crazy corner of America by showing how unique and yet universal these people are.

514430,5,6302801095,"Because the points are so subtle and the layers are so seemingly bottomless, this is the most intellectually challenging film I've seen.

Roger Ebert picked Gates of Heaven as one of the 10 greatest films because ""it is totally impenetrable. It is a mystery after 50 viewings that I have never solved. You can approach this film in a dozen different ways. It just doesn't have a bottom. And you can't decide, no matter how often you've seen it, if it's a comedy or a tragedy.""

Werner Herzog, a mentor to Errol Morris, literally ate his shoe in order to see this film get made. Here's how Werner described it: ""It's not a film on pet cemeteries. It's a film on the family behind all that with all their failures and all their dreams and all their dramas. It's the only authentic film on love and emotions in Late Capitalism, and maybe it's the only authentic film on loss of emotions and distortion of feelings and degeneration of feelings. It's a very, very sad film, and very purely done. It's an extremely pure film. And a very mature film. It's Errol Morris's very first film and it's a film of a very mature filmmaker.""

I'm glad this wasn't the first Errol Morris film I had seen simply because it's so immense and challenging that only through seeing his later films -- and in particular, Mr. Death and Tabloid -- could I understand, at least vaguely, what this film meant to him.",1342224000,3,1387,4.51792828685259

While it may seem slow-moving and at times a bit tedious, the fun is in the details. I tend to notice backgrounds, people's expressions, physical ticks or eccentricities or just plain off-the-wall stuff like bad fashion and even worse interiors. And this film is rife with them all.

I think what the film attempts to do is expose the pet funeral industry for what it truly is: a necessary evil for those who aren't satisfied with what their vet would do with a pet's body once little Fi-Fi has passed. I looked up the cemetary in question and it's still in operation and looks even more lovely and finished than it was presented newly finished in the film.

The main personalities are fascinating, especially the two sons of the owner, who could not be more different if they tried. One is from the corporate insurance sales world and one just blew in from the beach, the latter being the former's boss which makes for some humorous comparisons. And the Mom and Pop that own the place are a treat, especially juxtapositioned against the lovely California scenery. Other, uh, interesting folks fill in the spaces.

An all-around entertaining and engrossing film which I enjoyed immensely.",1307145600,,1289,4.6946902654867255
514435,5,6302801095,"This movie is technically about two pet cemeteries in California, one of which fails and the other of which succeeds.  But the real subject is the American attitude toward success and death.  Success is the great American obsession - how to get it, how to look like you have it, how to show it off.  And death is the great American taboo.  Success for the business backers of the first cemetery meant burying several animals per grave and other nasty practices.  For the second cemetery, it means, as the father of the bunch says, using ""sound business practices.""  The cemetery is his dream, and he can talk of nothing else.  His eldest son's dream of success is very different - he wants to be a singer-songwriter and have his songs be listened to by millions of people, but he's pretty much given it up.  The older son, Phillip, is the one most obviously obsessed with success.  He seems himself as a motivational speaker, and he constantly bloviates about how the principles of success can be applied to his tasks, including picking up the dead animals from the vets' offices and burying them.  Everyone speaks in an amazingly American idiom.  It is so true to life.  I've never heard a scripted movie that presented even a fraction of the number of American voices as this documentary.

The other subject of course is death.  Americans don't like to talk about death and like to hide it.  The rendering plant owner is almost like a stand up comedian in that he talks about rendering zoo animals like it's a joke - touching the taboo and making people laugh is key for stand up.  But it isn't funny, although he thinks it is. We see other people, sometimes pet owners, trying to come to terms with death, but not wanting to talk about it.  They give advice.  They show pictures.  They have their dogs sing with them.  The younger son, the singer-songwriter, is practical - he notes that you've got to dig the right sized hole - not too big but not so small you can't fit it in. The father has his own sort of religion that says that pets will be waiting for their owners in heaven.

I found myself glued to my seat as I listened and watched life through the eyes and hearts of real people affected by the loss of their pets and those wishing to help them with the grieving process...for better or for worse.  There's not a film like it out there.  If there is, let me know and I'll buy them, too.  Who should watch this?  I'd like to say ""everyone"", but it would hit home mostly with pet/animal lovers, entrepreneurs, kind-hearted folk, cut-throat business people, heartless cynics and anyone who'd like to take a pro and con look at how we treat ourselves and others...what inspires us...what deflates our minds and hearts...what is important in life...and what is not.  This movie has found a permanent home in my DVD collection.  Roger is right.  It is a ""masterpiece"".  Watch it with someone that likes to have in depth discussions after watching a thought-provoking film.  I wish I hadn't been alone, otherwise I'd be out at the local coffee shop talking up a storm.

514439,5,6302801095,"Roger Ebert calls this documentary 'A masterpiece...one of the top ten films of all time...They say you can make a great documentary about almost anything, if you see it well enough and truly, and this film proves it.' While on the surface, this might seem to be a film about people and their pets, it's really a study in human nature and psychology. It is people opening up to the camera about their dreams, hopes and disappointments. It initially is centered around the developer of a pet cemetery in Southern California that ultimately went bankrupt and how the 450 buried pets had to be dug up and transferred to another cemetery. The film then shifts to the owners of the new cemetery, a family run business, and the dynamics of the father and two sons as they share their 'success' strategies for life. Interspersed are interviews with owners whose pets had to be transferred and the trauma that goes along with that experience. This might have been a good candidate for 'reality TV' if that had existed. Not your everyday documentary but fascinating in its own way.",1255132800,,1072,4.737967914438503

I was really excited when, at first, I stumbled upon this film.  Halfway through, I paused the DVD to reread the copy on the DVD case and even fired up my computer to go back to the Amazon site to review the film's description again.  Gee wizzzzzzzzzzzzz...  I misunderstood the production and film descriptions completely. I had even glanced at the ""Critic's Comments"" and misinterpreted what was said.  I guess I was hoping the jist of the film would not be a lampooning of a subject that is very dear to my heart.  I kept expecting Ma and Pa Kettle to be interviewed and maybe even Michael Moore.

514498,3,6302801095,"The film has a perverse quality, as if watching someone slowly die, and trying to empathize with it. In that sense, the two films that most closely mirror it are fictive films- Werner Herzog's Even Dwarfs Started Small and Tod Browning's Freaks. One might also put it in league with the mockumentaries of Christopher Guest were it not played, or shot, straight. In fact, this is the film that Werner Herzog ate his shoe over. Morris had no money to finance the film and Herzog told him to do it anyway, and promised Morris that if he made a film, Herzog eat a shoe at the premiere, ala Charlie Chaplin in The Gold Rush. The act was subsequently made into the short subject film, Werner Herzog Eats His Shoe.
  The film's premise is that there are people who will pay thousands of dollars to bury their pets like humans. Ok, I'm a pet lover- a cat lover, but I've never done so. I've never viscerally understood why we bury humans. A corpse is a corpse is a corpse. As long as it is disposed of cleanly, who cares? Yet the film starts off with a disabled old man, Floyd McClure, who tried to start a pet cemetery south of San Francisco, the Foothill Pet Cemetery in Los Altos, because he was haunted by the memories and smells of an animal rendering plant he visited as a youth, as well as the death of his collie as a boy, when it was run over by a car. Manifestly lacking any business sense, the man soon lost his business- as well as did several other investors (one schlemiel lost thirty grand in 1970s cash!), and the animals- four hundred and fifty pets, had to be exhumed and moved to another better pet cemetery, the Bubbling Well Pet Memorial Park, in Napa Valley- which has designer plots, run by a family of even weirder folk, if possible....The weirdest and most hypnotic person onscreen is an old lady who sits in her home's doorway, and divides the film's halves between McClure and the Harbertses. She is Florence Rasmussen- the poster girl for human strangeness, and she distractedly and digressively paints her tale of woe, and her no good grandson- whom she's going to get money back from, and his whorish ex-wife, whom she calls a `tramp.' What this has to do with dead pets is anyone's guess, although she ends her soliloquy by lamenting the loss of a black kitten and suspecting that a kitty serial killer is on the prowl. She is sort of the addle-brained female equivalent of what Danny Harberts will likely end up as. Yet, despite all that, there is a genuine movement of emotion that the film conjures; as well as some truths- even if as trite as the quote which ends the last paragraph.
  Perhaps the greatest emotion conveyed is when dumb old Floyd McClure says, `When I turn my back, I don't know you, not truly. But I can turn my back on my little dog, and I know that he's not going to jump on me or bite me; but human beings can't be that way.' And this is why the film is worth watching. It is not even remotely a great film, but it is an interesting document, something that, like a truly great film, such as Yasujiro Ozu's Tokyo Story, could be sent on a spaceship for aliens to find in a million years, and tell something of what a real human was. The fact that such qualitatively disparate examples of an art form can reach the same level of inner....dare I say it?, truth, is one of those grand ineffables that makes art worth indulging, sort of like the last shot of Gates Of Heaven, of the Harberts' growing dream cemetery at dusk. On and on it just is. Then, like life and dream, it all ends. So, too, humanity. Alack?",1221091200,9,3556,4.399696048632219

514500,5,6302801095,"This unique film represents not only the beginning of Earl Morris' career, but the finest look at the American obsession with the treatment and care of our pets.

The format is simple; we are introduced to a man whose dream of a pet cemetery has failed. The remains of those animals were sent to another pet cemetery that is flourishing. In between, we meet the owners of both cemeteries and some of the pet owners and hear stories on a variety of subjects. It's hard to categorize this documentary as a comedy or drama since the tone is so straightforward. But that allows ""Gates of Heaven"" to soar above such conventions and reach a level few films ever have.

Some of the interviews are quite funny and I think all of us can relate to a scene early in the film when an elderly lady is holding her dog near her face and asking him to sing. Another very bizarre image is the sight of a man player his electric guitar at full blast overlooking the pet cemetery.

I was particularly moved by the stories of the two sons of the successful pet cemetery owner. The younger one seems quite lonely living all by himself, yet he seems content while his older brother is in quite a conundrum. Having failed in previous businesses and now behind his sibling at the cemetery, he's still proud of the ""positive mental approach"" he's been taught over the years.

The most stunning moment happens midway through the film when another elderly lady sits in her doorway and relates the story of her deceased pet. She quickly shifts to describe her no good son and tells that story in a way that is so natural, yet using words and phrases that Mark Twain would probably admire and be in awe of.

The presentation of the movie is full screen, not widescreen. But given how the movie was shot and the type of film used, the viewer is not missing much on the edges. I was somewhat disappointed in the lack of extras, such as no interview with Earl Morris. Or even a text background on the making of ""Gates of Heaven"" which would give some enlightenment to the journey the filmmaker took in making this masterpiece.

No doubt there will be a expanded or ""Ultimate"" edition DVD released that will include such extras. But for now we have this version and that will do.",1147564800,9,2246,4.47921760391198
514501,2,6302801095,"I love animals. I like documentaries. I respect Mr Ebert. Thus I bought Gates of Heaven when I saw it on his ""10 BEST"" list. Reading all the glowing reviews here, calling this ""one of the best American movies ever"", ""breaking down and crying afterwards"" etc, I suppose I am shallow, as I thought this was a boring, D-A-T-E-D, incoherent, S-L-O-W mishmash dotted here and there with some colourful characters and poignant images. I say ""dated"" because what seemed ""wacky"" and ""bizarre"" to people then, now feels like a bad mockumentry. I'd rather watch ""BEST IN SHOW"" , thank you very much. Just to put my view into perspective - I was deeply moved by the ""UP series"" (7-UP, etc), also on Mr Ebert's ""10 BEST"" list. I absolutely agree with his assessment and thank him for introducing me to those films. THIS one is at times charming, but on the whole very disappointing.",1137715200,11,870,4.6558441558441555
514502,5,6302801095,"A man with an unsettling resemblance and voice to Elmer Fudd of Loony Tunes fame recounts his trauma of losing his Collie in a car collision. Almost on the verge of tears, this sentimental bovine soul begins his failed quest to create a pet cemetery in Los Altos, California. Legal snafus force the pets to be unearthed and transferred to another cemetery in Napa, which is headed by the real stars of the film, a family of New Age entrepreneurs, including an aged patriarch who wears a straw hat with feminine scarves. He bloviates about the wonders of capitalism and how it fuses with sanctiminious bromides about people and their pets. Then there is his wife who prides the cemetery for being all about ""life and purity."" Her sons, both lazy, vain types, extol their jobs as if they were rocket scientists saving Planet Earth. In particular, the oldest son, Phillip, is a banal narcissist who massages his ego by describing himself as a ""motivational speaker"" with an expertise in psychology. His expertise inspires him to say such gems as ""If you intake negative thoughts, you'll outake negative thoughts. And if you take in postive thoughts, you'll bring out positive thoughts. . . . If you want to get real complex, there's an inbetween, a mix of positive and negative."" Then with a look of self-regard, he adds, ""This is what we call the gray area."" He then describes his ""dangerous mission,"" memorizing animal hospitals where he, a self-described ""transportation engineer,"" picks up dead pets. Phillip discusses the ""fear"" of having to know the map routes of these animal hospitals. The self-aggrandizement and exaggerated importance he attaches to his lowly job makes for comedy that makes you cringe.

At times I feel guilty for laughing at these vain exploiters of those who are grieving over their dead dogs and cats, but they bloviate on and on and sort of dig themselves into a hole. You have to wonder if they have gained any wisdom in the last twenty years or so when this film was made, so that they can laugh at themselves.

514505,5,6302801095,"I read Ebert's review before I saw the movie. Although I tend to agree with Ebert, I went into the film expecting to be let down. I watched it with my wife. After the first 15 minutes we looked at each other and sighed ""boring"". Then something strange happened. About 2/3ds of the way through we sat there stunned. My god, this is great!

I could personally care less about other people's pets, but that doesn't matter in this film. Somehow Morris gets all of these people to go deep. The rendering plant owner who makes a business of turning pets and farm animals into soap and glue explains his practical view of the end of life. The man who started a pet cemetery triggered by his hatred of rendering plants and his profound love of animals sounds a lot like the animal rights activists of today.

The sometimes silly but poigniant commentary of pet owners dotted throughout the documentary give glimpses of love and loss.

We were really taken with the second set of pet cemetery owners. They are pure capitalists who are successful in business because they know their customers and how to squeeze the most out of a buck. In spite of that rather stark exterior, they wonderfully round out Morris's study of human nature. They show jealousy, loneliness, joy, pride, delusion, frustration and cunning, but no apparent love.

The jumping-off point for their stories is the death of their adored pets, and the history of their reciprocal loving relationships. And no sooner do they begin to tell their pet stories then, as is the case in much self-report and self-disclosure, stories veer off into human relationships and many other life events. The presenters seem to split into 2 factions, those who've lost their pets and those who've made a business of burying them. And there's considerable intensity and emotion in all, and Morris doesn't overly editorialize, though there definitely exists a dynamic of spirituality and compassion versus pragmatism and industry.  He lets the viewer be informed, moved, often amused, and allows him/her to interpret and draw conclusions from the stories told.
