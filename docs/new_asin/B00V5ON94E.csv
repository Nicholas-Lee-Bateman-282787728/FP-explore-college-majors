8709363,5,B00V5ON94E,"Honestly, I paid a reasonable price for Law Abiding Citizen. I just happened to get a decent movie with it as a bonus. I never heard of the Seeking Justice flick but I do appreciate Nick Cage. It wasn't bad. Although LAC is awesome! If you haven't seen it, check it out! Gerard and Jamie are excellent and the plot keeps you guessing.",1517097600,,334,4.317460317460317
