919278,4,6304756410,"This is a movie that I have on a DVD, and it's a good movie. It's one of the greatest family movies I've ever seen, and it's about family getting together and having Sunday dinners. This movie ""Soul Fooi"" is also a movie that reminds me of times like Thanksgiving, and I would watch this movie on the day of Thanksgiving. I find this is movie ""Soul Food"" is also similar to the 2007 Christmas movie ""This Christmas"", and I do have that movie on a DVD as well. There's one actor in this movie that's also in that 2007 Christmas movie, and it's Mekhi Phifer. Just like in this movie ""Soul Food"", I find he played a good role. So after watching this movie ""Soul Food"", I would then watch the movie ""This Christmas"" that I find similar to this movie, and with Mekhi Phifer who was one of the main characters that also played in this movie.",1509753600,,835,4.2578616352201255

920457,5,6304756410,"Soul Food is a film that can't be described in only a few words but without giving it away i will give a brief preface,it is definately a film that will never be forgotten. Soul Food centers around the Joseph family where sunday dinners are a tradition in which the complete immidiate family attends. The film takes us into various branches of a family through the eyes of a young child featuring sibling rivalry between the sisters and more drama that follows family. But when serious situations arise weddings, funerals, births,family arguments and tension which makes the film all the more relatable the family learns to batton down the hatches and do what family are supposed to do best, stick together. Although the film is made up of an all black cast the story is universal and tackles a topic that most of us know all to well,family. The acting is top notch and the cast is amazing with the acting chops of Vivica A. Fox, Michael Beach,Nia Long, Vanessa Williams, Irma P. Hall and Brandon Hammond. The film will make you laugh and cry and laugh again its got a great way at making one look back at their own family. Its a film that shouldn't be missed, grab a bowl of popcorn and have a good cry Soul Food is truly food to the soul. The film is a one disc feature and includes a directors commentary, trailer and interviews with the cast. The film is one not to be missed.",1350950400,,1380,4.458498023715415

The script is a train wreck, racked by redundancies, cliches, and dialogue that doesn't ring true, like that of the older cast members talking ""street"" to the young Ahmad. Way too many loose ends are left dangling. Where realism should happen (the dialogue, or the contrived meeting in the print shop cafeteria), there's melodrama and/or predictability. Where a bit more ""Hollywood"" might have been in order (more resolution re: the marriage of the  Vanessa Williams character, what happens to her husband's band, and making some of Ahmad's dialogue more audible) we're left wondering.

920536,3,6304756410,"I have cerebral palsy, and for the last few months I have had my first African American aide. He laughs at me because nearly all of the films in my collecttion are dark, violent, and depressing. So, he made me watch ""Soul Food"" and the best part of the movie is the insight it brought to me with regard to his cooking. (I have hardly been to a restaurant since his arrival.) I know nothing about cooking, and that is probably a good thing because he says he wouldn't share his his ""secrets"" anyway. Though I HAVE noticed that he has NEVER, EVER used a measuring cup. (something that is reflected in this film.) Also, before he came I avoided green beans like the plague. (I'm sure many a Black person has knowingly mocked the rubbery, limp, God-awful things we White people call green beans. White children drench these abominations in ketchup and even then have to be forced to eat them a gunpoint...) However, there is a scene in ""Soul Food"" in which a child excitedly recites the menu that includes green beans with his smile intact, and there is not a ketchup bottle in sight. (I now have ""string beans"" with every meal.) I feel free to include these things in a review because it seesms to me that ""Soul Food"" is largely true to it's title, the movie is ABOUT THE FOOD and it's apparently unifying power, it's also about the kind of food we deprived and deathly bland White Northern dwellers have been missing. (My aide has informed me that a select group of White Southerners have been made honorary initiates into the art.) So, if there are any people out there who have stumbled upon a sampling of Soul Food and are wondering how it's done, this movie will give you a precious glimpse.....",1169683200,5,1697,4.495145631067961

920563,4,6304756410,"I watched Soul Food expecting a powerful film about a black family coming together in a time of crisis. I got that and a lot more. We watch the story unfold from the perspective of a twelve-year-old boy. From his eyes we see the stories of the Matriarch and her three daughter's families. When Big Momma dies, Chaos threatens to destroy the family as each of the three daughters become more selfish in dealing with their own personal problems. The twelve year old spends the rest of the film trying to bring his crumbling extended family back together.

The production values were amazing for a $6 million dollar movie, I felt like I was watching a $50 million film. The cinematographer and director do a great job; I felt like I was on those Chicago streets along with the family. All of the actors here give great performances, Vanessa Williams, is unforgettable as Bird. Viveca Fox shows range in her role as the middle daughter and Nia Long is great as the baby of the family. On the men's side Michael Beach gives another strong performance. Beach should be a bigger star than he is; he gave some great performances in the 90's. Other noteworthy performances include the actress who played Big Momma and the twelve year old who the story revolves around.",1092873600,,1259,4.645739910313901

But I have only praises for this film's portrayal of African American families, no film can accurately portray anything but this film comes very close to authentic.
If you'll pardon the few adult situations and language, you have a pretty decent family movie though I wouldn't necessarily invite little kids along for the ride. The rivalry between the sisters particularly Williams and Fox kinda went unresolved I don't think they really made a mends at the end. And William's husband cheating on her with her half sister, maybe that was a bit unnecessary for the drama. But this a great film. Highly recommended.",1030233600,2,739,4.873015873015873

I would always watch this movie for the fun of it until I used it as a project in my English class in which I had to examine why I liked the movie so much. In doing this I discovered that the lives that the women and their mates lead in this movie are ideal lives for many people today such as; Teri(Vannessa Williams) being a succesful career woman, Maxine(Vivica Fox)being a great mom and wife, and Bird(Nia Long)being a young sucessful entrepreneur and diva. Not to leave out the men; Lem(Mekhi Phifer)is a determined hard worker trying to turn away from crime, Kenny(Jeffery Sams) is a sucessful business owner and good father/husband and lastly, Miles an successful lawyer/music producer. With all these things good in their lives this movie still dipictis the ture life struggles of an everyday family very well (notice I did not say black family). It shows that through life's worse mishaps love will get you through things. Great cast, greater soundtrack, good story! Recommended for all to see!!!!",1014076800,,1165,4.632850241545894
920580,3,6304756410,"SOUL FOOD is the type of movie that you like not because of what it is, but from what you hope it to be. Irrespective of your race or ethnic background, you are bound to connect on some level with this film.
The story itself is not very original. It involves an African American family that gathers weekly for the family dinner. The focus is on three sisters, who share their hopes, dreams and frustrations. The story is told through the eyes of the son of the middle sister. While the film is told through a his eyes, it is not a story for children because of some of the themes explored like adultery. It's an odd way to tell this story, but it works most of the time.
Unfortunately, writer/director George Tillman, Jr. (with an uncredited rewrite by Tina Andrews) do not know the meaning of subtlety and nuance. The characters are drawn with broad strokes. Teri (Vanessa L. Williams) is the cold and hard-driving overachiever of the family. Maxine (Vivica A. Fox) is the aggressive, but ""down to earth"" stay-at-home mom, and Bird (Nia Long) is the baby of the family, who has just married the neer-do-well, Lem (Mekhi Phifer). Each one of their stories follows a fairly predictable course.
This is not to say that the movie is without charm. It's nice to see a black movie that is not focusing on gangs or drugs. It's also a film that shows black people from several different generations.
You feel for the struggles of the characters, although many of the situations seem forced and over the top. One particular scene that comes to mind is when Teri's character pulls out a knife. It seems to completely contradict her character as an educated professional woman.
The film also follows the clich of many character driven pieces in that a key character must die. In this case, it's milked for all it's worth.
Overall, SOUL FOOD is an entertaining film, but delivers a lot less than it promises. Although it was marketed as a family film, it is really for adults because of the violence and sexuality on screen. If you're looking for a film about a black family (as opposed to a black family film), it's worth a look. As long as you don't keep you expectations too high, you won't be disappointed.",1013644800,10,2199,4.583756345177665

Terri is the ultra-high-maintenance lawyer; Maxine is the down-to earth mother of a young son, and Bird is the sassy hairdresser who tries to shake off her ex while married to her thuggish, ex-con husband.  The storyline can get predictable; and a couple of the characters verge on stereotype, but there's enough talent in this film to make it worth your while.

And the memorable line that came from pop singer/actor Vanessa Williams that goes like ""You guys can't even agree on small things like Sunday dinners.""

This movie is about the ups and downs of life and how a family  sticks together no matter what hard times come around. It shows how one  person(the grandmother) had such a strong power over everybody by keeping  them together.
