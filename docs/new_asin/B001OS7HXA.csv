8331274,5,B001OS7HXA,A great way to practice karate outside a dojo..... Thank you for these high quality videos of kata which I can now practice at my own leisure!,1409529600,,142,4.296296296296297
8331275,5,B001OS7HXA,"I've been out of Shotokan for a number of years and getting back into it now that we live close to a Shotokan school. These videos have helped me to remember my katas very quickly. These videos are especially helpful for someone with a background in martial arts. For someone who is familiar with martial arts, with the instruction on these videos you can pick up the moves to a new kata quickly. This video series is highly recommended.",1338854400,,437,4.544303797468355
8331276,5,B001OS7HXA,"This DVD is absolutely excellent. If you are a student of Shotokan, this DVD will help you perfect your katas. It is sometimes hard to learn a kata from the instructor alone; some people just have a hard time visualizing the steps, much less what each technique is actually portraying as far as practical self-defense techniques. This DVD makes each step of the katas clear, showing eacg from different angles and also showing the practical applications for each technique. I found that the lines which are marked on the floor were also very helpful. The demonstrations are great and provide the student with excellent examples of how the katas should look when performed correctly.

The quality of the DVD is wonderful and seems to be much more professionally filmed and edited than many of the other martial arts videos on the market. Overall, I highly recommend this, as well as the other DVD's by Joel Ertl and Anita Bendickson. Over the years, the high quality videos from these two instructors have helped me perfect my katas, as well as helping me better explain and teach these katas to my students. I absolutely can find nothing negative to say about these DVD's at all. They are top of the line and if you are a student of Shotokan karate, I urge you to get your own copy; they will help you on your quest to earn your blackbelt in Shotokan - bottom line. 5+ Stars!

8331277,5,B001OS7HXA,"These DVDs have been a huge asset to my Shotokan training.  I have a ton of books on kata and techniques, but these kata DVDs really work for me. Sometimes it is very hard to understand the concepts as they are described in a book. It makes such a difference to be able to actually see the proper form and timing of each move. It's great to be able to replay the moves again and again until I get it right.",1231632000,,406,4.012345679012346
8331278,5,B001OS7HXA,"For any serious Shotokan Karate students, this is a must have to continue the development of their training.  Joel and Anita demonstrated the katas clearly and is easy to understand the applications of the techniques.  I recommend this video along with other advanced kata volumes from Joel and Anita.
