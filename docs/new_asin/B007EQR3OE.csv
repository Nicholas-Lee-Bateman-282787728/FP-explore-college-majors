8515367,3,B007EQR3OE,"Rose Tattoo - ""The Meanest Band In The World"" - is a group I'd heard of, but never actually listened to. Now this DVD was a decent overall introduction to them for me, but will be of interest for more established fans because this is part of a festival show, and their set is only an hour long and some of the performances seem rushed, and the sound mix wasn't as good as it could have been. Let's take a look at the bands history, then we'll look at the DVD's somewhat abbreviated setlist.

Wikipedia:
Rose Tattoo is an Australian rock and roll band, now led by Angry Anderson, that was formed in Sydney in 1976. Their sound is hard rock mixed with blues rock influences, with songs including ""Bad Boy for Love"", ""Rock 'n' Roll Outlaw"", ""Nice Boys"", ""We Can't Be Beaten"" and ""Scarred for Life"". Their first four albums were produced by Harry Vanda and George Young who also worked with AC/DC. They disbanded in 1987, subsequently reforming briefly in 1993 to support Guns N' Roses on an Australian tour. They reassembled again from 1998 and have since released two more studio albums.

We didn't reform until '92. In '93, the word got around, because we had reformed with our existing drummer Paul DeMarco. The Gunners heard we were out playing again and said, 'We want you to do our support gigs throughout Australia.' We did those two [Guns N' Roses] raceways gigs - Eastern Creek in Sydney and the raceway down in Melbourne[cite this quote].""

Rose Tattoo supported Guns N' Roses on the Australian leg of their Use Your Illusion Tour. Anderson, Wells, Cocks, Leach and new drummer Paul DeMarco from Wells' solo band reunited for the 1993 tour.

According to Australian rock music historian Ian McFarlane, Rose Tattoo are ""one of the most revered bands of all time. The Tatts played peerless, street-level heavy blues with the emphasis on slide guitar and strident lyric statements"". Guns N' Roses, L.A. Guns, Keel, Nashville Pussy, Motosierra, Pud Spuke and Helen Schneider have covered Rose Tattoo songs. On 16 August 2006, they were inducted into the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame. Five former members have died in recent years including four of the original recording line-up, Dallas Royall (1991), Peter Wells (2006), Ian Rilen (2006) and Mick Cocks (2009), and Lobby Loyde (2007), who was a member between October 1979 and September 1980.
