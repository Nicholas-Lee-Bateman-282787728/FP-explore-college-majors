8421999,3,8819940035,"Disc 1 Subtitled His life by Dr. Tommy Mitchell (54 min)

An interesting talk given by a Christian. Mitchell makes no attempt to conceal his somewhat biased and judgmental opinions about England during Darwin's times. To his credit Mitchell tells you about Darwin and uses several quotes taken from The Autobiography of Charles Darwin. Mitchell points out Darwin's ""muddled theology"" that stems from never being a Christian to begin with. The truth of the matter, Mitchell says, was Darwin's inability to come to terms with death and suffering in our world. Darwin seems unhappy with the world guided by God but happy with the same world if guided by natural selection. As viewers in the 21st century we know that there are other ways to simultaneously view these two conflicting cognitions. Mitchell, in my opinion, is as blinded by his faith just as much as Darwin was blinded by his lack of faith. Cognitive dissonance, natural and synthetic happiness are elements of psychology not theology.

After watching this DVD I'm more interested in reading The Autobiography of Charles Darwin along with Leon Festinger's A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance. We all know how death and suffering exist in our world but we may not fully understand the mechanisms that influence our levels happiness. Darwin knew that men do not always think and act out of a primitive survival instinct. At times we seem to value all life and try to help those who cannot help themselves. We build hospitals, schools and support the unfortunate victims of natural disasters. We even attempt to rescue animals in danger of extinction.

Disc 2 Subtitled His Science by Dr. David Menton (54 min)

Menton focused upon selected chapters from Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species and highlights its major flaws given today's scientific understanding. An easy task given that in Darwin's day very little was known about genetics or biology compared to today.

Disc 3 Subtitled His Impact by Ken Ham (48 min)

Ham is the president of Answers in Genesis and the Creation Museum. He speaks very little about Darwin other than repeating a few points from disc 1 and 2. His talk for English speaking Christians it's about sin, truth and the authority of the bible. Especially Genesis 1-11 and Psalms 11:3. His polemical talk is consistently circular like his organizations mission statement. The Christian Bible is supreme authority in everything it teaches as well as being the final guide to the interpretation of Scripture is Scripture itself. Like Richard Dawkins he sees science at war against religion and the English speaking churches are not doing so well. But after all it's an English war, a Christian crusade. In my opinion Ham simply wasted most of his time except for a few good points about people being constant with what they have been taught. This should be a warning to everyone. Do we want to live in a world under the tyranny from either side? If we are the image of God we have truly fallen a great distance. If we are descendent from apes we are indeed naked and crazy animals.",1384473600,,3066,4.8752399232245685
8422000,5,8819940035,"Dr. David Menton has provided an excellent critique of Charles Darwin's book: On the Origin of Species By Natural Selection......,chapter by chapter in this DVD titled: The Evolution of Darwin: His Science. Many quotes pro and con by those in the scientific community are included in this lecture by Dr. Menton.
 I highly recomend this DVD. The science of Darwin regarding biological evolution dominates the school systems of America and the rest of the civilized world.  To object to Darwin's story is not allowed, even to discussion of problems with his story of origins. Of course most of us have been taught Biological Evolution as fact. Many have begun to question Darwin's science.
Dr. Menton's credentials are impeccable. Those who have their minds open to the idea that questioning the ""science"" used to support Biological Evolution should be allowed in our schools, will find this DVD an excellent resource.
