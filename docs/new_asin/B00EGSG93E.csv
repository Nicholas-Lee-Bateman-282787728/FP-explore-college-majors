At first I didnt' realize that it was in German and English and thought I had to send it back. Then I figured out how to get the English version.  Meanwhile, Amazon, - so efficient, had already issued a returns authorization and credited my account. I asked UPS to cancel return. I assume Amazon did  re-charge my account.  Thank you for excellent service.",1398643200,5,491,4.809523809523809
