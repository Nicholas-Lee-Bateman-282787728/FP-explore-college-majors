But the one titke that has forever been out of reach has been Four Flies, the final completion of his Animal triligy that started with Bird with the Crystal Plumage. Ever since the release of Mother of Tears I hoped that someone out there would finally see that it was time to either hunt down or clean up this Argento film for a proper release on DVD. Whoever that maybe I thank you, thank you so much!!!!!!",1229558400,2,542,4.376237623762377
3683727,4,B001LIK8DO,"Dario Argento took a gamble creating a story that revolves around an unlikeable jerk, who, at best, is remote and wooden (whether that's the actor's fault or the director.............?).  I couldn't even summon a cursory amount of sympathy for his plight.  The plot concerns a self-absorbed musician (Michael Brandon as Roberto Tobias) who is stalked by a mysterious man careful to stare at him from a safe distance.  (The imagery reminded me of Rene Magritte's paintings of a man in a suit wearing a bowler hat.)  Fed up, Roberto follows this stalker and `accidentally' kills him, gaining the interest of a mask-wearing photographer clever enough to be at the scene of the crime at just the right moment.  Before you can scream setup, someone tries to blackmail him.  At this point, I was beginning to wish Argento had hired one of the other actors considered for this pivotal role (Terence Stamp or Michael York).  Brandon's great reluctance to show any expression was frustrating and puzzling.  His wife Nina Tobias (Mimsy Farmer) was equally uninvolved.  At one point, I forgot she was even in this movie.  In fact, few of the characters/actors manifested any great presence on screen.  This curious state of detachment hovered throughout, making the final revelation scene grandiloquent and overblown in comparison.  It was a bit late to be injecting some emotion into the story.  Equally odd, Argento also included a lot of humor (like the running gag with the mailman).
As always, Argento's greatest strength is with imagery (a well considered use of color and spatial design, not to mention his love of POV shots).

I liked it enough to keep it in my collection for future viewing.",1438128000,5,1689,4.9644128113879

3683729,3,B001LIK8DO,"Being a fan of Dario Argento I decided to take a gamble on this movie. Dario's earlier work is what had defined him. During the 60's and 70's Giallo was at it's peak and it influenced horror the world over. I didn't have this in my personal collection so when it was released I immediately ordered it to add to my collection.

I'll admit it's got decent twists to it. Do I think it's Dario's best work. No. I can't quite put my finger on it, but something with the plot doesn't work for me. Decent suspense but nothing ground breaking that I haven't seen before. Maybe I'm jaded because I'm constant adding to my Giallo collection.

For the price some are asking $40 and higher. I wouldn't recommend it. Not unless you're a hardcore Giallo or Argento fan. I got it at a decent price, check often as at times the price can fluctuate. But lately it seems the way things are going the prices are climbing, I'm not sure if it's still in production. Best bet is to check the distributors webpage Shameless Screen Entertainment, you might be able to get it at a better price.

I'd say it's no more than a $25 move at best. ( that's pushing it )

Read reviews and do some research before you purchase this as the price is getting steeper. Go to the Shameless webpage and watch the trailer they have on their page before you make the plunge.",1422835200,7,1333,4.341365461847389
3683730,4,B001LIK8DO,"First off, once again I received an order from Amazon with 2 out of 3 disc cases in my order including Four Flies on Grey Velvet being broken and pieces of plastic jostling around with the discs loose from the case 'spindles', it's a miracle that this disc wasn't scratched up.

This is a good film albeit quite slow paced and the main character actor is very wooden with next to no emotion considering the perilous predicament he finds himself in throughout the movie. Aside from that it's excellent and one of Argento's cleanest shot movies, especially compared to Phenomena. The plot is ok, but I figured out the antagonist as early as half way through the movie or earlier but with Argento the ride is the joy of his movies.

If you love Argento this is well worth collecting. The transfer is decent, but some of the dark scenes almost look like grain art it's so blurry but I find many modern movies suffer the same anomalies.",1398297600,,931,4.535714285714286

3683733,5,B001LIK8DO,"Dario Argento made many classic mystery horror movies in his career. He managed to be make successful movies that were well recieved around the world. this was his third film, the first two 'the bird with the crystal plumage' and this was followed by 'cat o nine tails' , both are available in very good blu rays in the u.s. This one, his third movie , is only available from the uk in this all region blu ray. It will play on your player here without a problem. I went to amazon.comuk to get a cheaper price on this item though. This one  has been restored and looks fantastic, it looks like a brand new ptint, as if you were sitting in the theater back in 1972!. Shameless remastered this and removed print damage, they also found some lost elements and put them back in. those elements are from vhs quality film and they are rare. But you have the option to watch the film without the added footage. (which is not alot of footage actually!). This is how I wish all old movies were treated on blu ray! This is restored and has not looked this good for a long time. IN fact it was thought to be a lost movie , with only bad prints available. They found the print though and restored it and it looks great. The movie itself is a sandard giallo  about a killer who is hunting down people , and a hero who must defeat the evil one. Giallos are movies that follow that type of formula. They are usually bloody and at the time they were pushing the level in violence onscreen hugely. Giallos had their peak from 1968-79. with few made after that , whereas in that period hundreds were made! the blu ray looks fantastic here, like all restored movies from that era. There are several extras on here as well.  A first class effort from shameless. A company that delivers in older italian horror/giallo movies both on dvd and now blu ray. This movie is not up to 'deep reds' level of greatness however. It was that movie which was a monster classic  hit and this one was a decent good solid giallo. the cating is good in this one , with the excellent Mimsy farmer doing a great job in the female lead position. Mimsy was one of the better actresses working in italian horror during this period. If you love dario argento and giallos this one is for you. Or if you just love to see a 40 uyear old movie treated with respect and restored on blu ray then this is good one. After all most older horror movies are not getting this type of treatment on blu ray.  The classic film 'becket' got this treatment and for a horror to equal that kind of treatment is outstanding.",1352419200,7,2559,4.300829875518672

A few weeks ago, I watched INFERNO and BIRD WITH THE CRYSTAL PLUMAGE, leading me to finally see FOUR FLIES ON GREY VELVET. I must say that FLIES is superb, even w/ it's sometimes-goofy characters and lifeless leading man. Argento is indeed a genius of suspense, mystery, and horror, using symbols and colors to paint his gloriously bizarre pictures.

Dreams, con-games, and reality mix in this early Argento giallo that shows many of the hallmarks that would become Argento signatures, but which also falters in places.

3683736,2,B001LIK8DO,"Long lost in a prolonged rights battle and unseen for years, Dario Argento's Four Flies On Grey Velvet may come from his most consistently inspired period but it's still such thin and often tedious stuff you'd half suspect he was keeping it hidden himself out of embarrassment until you realize that he's happy enough for the far worse Phantom of the Opera and The Card Player to still be out there. The chief problem is the disjointed and unconvincing plotting, but Michael Brandon's insipid performance as the unlikeable and uninterestingly passive musician being blackmailed after accidentally killing someone shows up just how rickety this one is without a charismatic or proactive figure to hold it together. It's not without its compensations and a couple of striking pieces of imagery - a recurring sequence of a Saudi execution and an ultra-slow motion car crash - although Argento seems to be expending far more energy and visual flair into purely expositionary shots like letters being delivered or phone calls being made than the surprisingly few setpieces. Too often he relies on cheap gimmickry, be it Jean-Pierre Marielle's camp gay private eye (""Oh, you heterosexuals!"") who has never solved a case or the old `image caught on dead person's retina' plot device, while the main character treads water. The less said about the clumsy comedy (much of which comes from brutally beating an Arab postman), the better. There's an appealing performance from Francine Racette that partially offsets Mimsy Farmer's hysterical overacting and a cameo from Bud Spencer that briefly threatens to liven things up but it's far more forgettable than it has any right to be in that unwelcome I-think-I'm-dropping-off-to-sleep kind of way. Even a second viewing of the film with lowered expectations feels like clearing out the garage: you might find the odd item of interest but for the most part it's just a tedious chore.

The Region 1 NTSC DVD may have much better picture quality than the bootleg copies floating around, but aside from being a slightly cut version the sound quality on the English soundtrack is very poor, making Brandon sound even more bored than he is to begin with and most of the women ironically sound like female impersonators. The Italian soundtrack is much better - but since only a brief section of the film is subtitled in English that's not going to be much help for most viewers. Not much in the way of extras either: English opening and closing credits, stills gallery, the Italian trailer, a US TV spot and a copy of the US trailer that's been mastered from what looks like an atrocious seventh-generation dupe video source.",1284940800,3,2656,4.995485327313769
3683737,4,B001LIK8DO,"This early Dario Argento giallo boasts mainly a haunting Ennio Morricone score and a few excellent set-pieces to make it well worth viewing (the fact that it's been unavailable in a decent, viewable  format up until last year also lent it a certain holy grail mystique for Argentophiles like me). The performances by Jean-Pierre Marielle as a flamboyantly gay detective (he brings a certain dignity to an obviously stereotypical role) and Mimsy Farmer as the hero's jittery wife are nicely done; Michael Brandon fares less well as the wooden, none-too-sympathetic leading man.  There are several stylish directional touches here that hint of the delirious highwater mark that was still to bloom full flower in Argento's mid-seventies-to-early-eighties work (in Deep Red through Opera, to be exact), particularly in the groovy opening credits and in the slo-mo final sequence, the latter of which achieves a poetry rare in horror films.

3683741,3,B001LIK8DO,"FOUR FLIES ON GREY VELVET
[Quattro Mosche di Velluto Grigio]

(Italy/France - 1972)

Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Techniscope)
Theatrical soundtrack: Mono

A rock drummer (Michael Brandon) is terrorized by a masked stranger who possesses incriminating photographs of an incident in which Brandon accidentally killed a man. Blackmail and murder ensue...

A step up from the convoluted machinations of THE CAT O'NINE TAILS (1970), FOUR FLIES ON GREY VELVET is little more than a dress rehearsal for the visual flourishes that would distinguish director Dario Argento's later work. The restless camera and flashy editing techniques which lift ""Flies"" out of its genre rut are mere indicators of the chaotic splendor to come, though here it's largely wasted on a flimsy narrative stretched almost to breaking point. Though reportedly unhappy with Brandon's casting (a role offered to any number of disparate actors, including Tony Musante, Terence Stamp, Jean-Louis Trintignant, Michael York and James Taylor!), Argento draws an effective performance from his leading man as the innocent protagonist caught up in events beyond his control, as a masked figure emerges from the shadows to eliminate anyone who stumbles on his/her identity. The resolution is ripe with Freudian excess, and concludes with a spectacular demise for the psychopathic villain, using state-of-the-art camera-work in typical Argento fashion.

As in his first two films, Argento includes a variety of eccentric supporting characters, often to distracting comic effect (eg. a running gag with Brandon's postman, culminating in what amounts to a criminal assault - played for laughs!), and while the horror set-pieces are often vividly realized - most notably, the scene in which Brandon's blackmailing maid (Marisa Fabbri) finds herself trapped in a lonely park with the killer, a sequence which refers backward to a similar scenario in Jacques Tourneur's THE LEOPARD MAN (1943) and forward to John Saxon's final sequence in Argento's TENEBRAE (1982) - the pace is labored and dull, especially during expository dialogue scenes.

Mimsy Farmer makes a fair impression as Brandon's nervous wife, while popular Italian character actor Bud Spencer (Carlo Pedersoli) plays Brandon's closest friend, a bad-tempered fisherman who helps him solve the unfolding mystery. Jean-Pierre Marielle camps it up as a gay private detective with a poor track record of catching criminals, a role which borders on caricature and ends ignobly (in a public lavatory, no less!). All in all, a minor entry in the director's filmography, elevated to mythic status by legal problems which prevented its appearance on home video until the early 21st century, and while the film exercises a gamut of stylistic concerns (Argento followed it with an unlikely detour into historical comedy, FIVE DAYS OF MILAN, before cutting loose with his giallo masterpiece DEEP RED), it amounts to little more than a footnote in horror history.",1256688000,2,2961,5.454148471615721
3683742,4,B001LIK8DO,"Look, it's a vast improvement on the German semi bootleg that was floating around last year.  Shame about the scratches on the print near the end.  If you like Argento, you'll love this.  Others may find its quirks a little odd.  Those looking for a first Argento film should try Deep Red or Suspiria.  That said, the Morricone score is worth admission price alone and there's some nice editing.",1245110400,2,395,4.666666666666667
3683743,4,B001LIK8DO,"As a Dario Argento fan, I thought this was a lost film.  Prints of this film rarely pop up anywhere, and the VHS copies of it (which were put out by Paramount many centuries ago) are impossible to find, and if they are found, they're usually so worn (and pan and scan) that they aren't worth looking for.  But alas, the film was not lost, and thank goodness.  This is a great Argento film, the best of his early work (aka the animal trilogy), and a great precursor to his later masterpieces.

There is a lot to enjoy here.  Argento's camerawork here is quinessentially Argento, and his framing and lighting give this film a superb, surreal look.  Even ordinary things seem strange and evil.  The film has a lot of cool twists, and it also has some darkly hilarious scenes, especially the one that takes place in a funeral parlour.  There are people trying out coffins for their future deaths, and it's one of Argento's most amusing scenes in all his work.  The scene where they examine an eyeball is surreal and creepy, and the music score is haunting.  Even the songs from the main character's rock band are pretty good.  Argento's framing is very good as well (the DVD has been restored to its 2.35:1 aspect ratio), and some of the violence is quite jarring, even by today's standards.  It also has the best opening credit sequence in any of Argento's work.

The only problem the film has is boring English dialog and wooden performances (which happens a lot in Argento's work), especially by the lead Michael Brandon, who shows hardly any emotion at all in this film.  The supporting characters, however, are quite colorful (especially ""the professor"", a bumbling mailman, a gay private detective, and ""God"") and amusing.  This is a must film for any Argento fan, and it's really one of his best films.",1241654400,4,1805,4.649842271293376
3683744,4,B001LIK8DO,"Four Flies ranks somewhere in the middle of Argento's films. Way better than is 90s era stuff like Trauma, but not quite on par with Suspiria or Deep Red. Still I'd recommend it to anyone who is is even mildly an Argento fan.

I have mixed feelings about this DVD. The picture quality is great, and, let's face it, the visuals are really the main attraction in any Argento film. There is an ugly black line across the screen during the climax, but, after checking the video on some of the bootleg copies that are floating around the 'net, this appears to be part of the source film?

Also, the sound quality is poor but passable. Basically, the audio is crackly, like an old, dusty vinyl LP. Often it is too quiet and you'll be leaning in to your TV trying to hear the dialogue or the wonderful Ennio Morricone score.

Fans will still have to wait for the perfect DVD of 4 Flies, but, for the time being, this version will do fine.",1240704000,7,931,4.339080459770115
3683745,5,B001LIK8DO,"I am so glad that this title was finally released. It has to be one of Argento's best. This is the Final chapter in the ""Animal Trilogy.""

Plot Quoted from Wikipedia -

""Roberto Tobias (Brandon) is a drummer in a rock band who has noticed a man following him for the last several days. Angered by this, he confronts the stranger in an abandoned theater to find out what he wants. The man claims he does not know what Roberto is talking about, and pulls a switchblade. The two struggle, and Roberto accidentally stabs the man, who falls into an orchestra pit, lifeless. To make matters worse, someone in a bizarre puppet mask has been hiding in the upper wings of the theater and takes incriminating photographs of Roberto holding the bloody knife. Roberto flees, but the next day he receives the dead man's ID in the mail. It becomes apparent that the masked figure has no interest in going to the police, and instead wants to drive Roberto mad with fear and paranoia. But why?""

This is a must see for all Argento fans!",1239148800,,1020,4.5027027027027025

3683747,4,B001LIK8DO,"First, a word of caution - if you haven't already seen the film you'd do well to avoid Amazon's image gallery as it pretty much gives the game away.

As with the previous two entries in the unofficial Animal Trilogy, Four Flies on Grey Velvet is short on explicit gore but brimming with atmosphere and artistic ingenuity, with set-piece murders primed and mined for maximum tension. It was with this film that Argento began to cement his particular style and is something of a crucible for future ideas. The murder of Roberto's maid in a local park foreshadows John Saxon's fate in Tenebre, and with its sudden lapses in time and attempted escape through the cobwebbed space between two buildings (to a soundtrack of whispers and sighs) it also sows seeds that would flourish in Suspiria. Other visual motifs (crimson curtains, extreme close-ups, inanimate objects suddenly wielded by a seemingly maniacal camera) would be repeated or re-jigged in Deep Red, Phenomena and Opera.

Argento's original intention was to have a gay protagonist and though the character of Roberto is still open to such a reading - his victimisation being as a result of a fear of being outed (as a murderer) has obvious correlations (note also Brandon's shaggy mane v Farmer's gamine crop or the rather tame bathtub scene with Francine Racette which sees Roberto playfully seducing his mirror image) - the more overt references are passed to Jean-Pierre Marielle who brings immense likeability to a small role as the PI hired by Roberto, and whose swish factor is tempered by a steely determination to finally cracking a case. A frosty Farmer acquits herself well, though Brandon is merely okay. Argento's fascination with weird science (here ludicrous by design but ingenious in execution) gives the film its animal-themed title, and the finale boasts one of his greatest sequences - a stunning, slow-motion shot of a car impacting with the back of a lorry, which marries chillingly beautiful aesthetics to Hollywood folklore, scored with Morricone's haunting ""Come un Madrigale"".

Having spent nearly 40 years in bootleg hell the picture quality in this release is a revelation, as has been noted, however, the English audio is problematic, there are no English subtitles included for the full Italian audio and there are minor cuts to transitions between scenes which are occasionally jarring. How much of a nuisance all this proves comes down to personal taste, but chuck in a couple of obvious factual errors on the sleeve blurb and sadly it amounts to a rather sloppy rush-release from MYA, whose claims of ""fully uncut and with an astounding picture and sound quality"" are at best over-zealous.

Four Flies is a solid giallo and an important entry in the Director's canon which bears repeated viewing, blurring gender roles and sexual identity, adding subtext and hit and miss humour, asylum flashbacks, well-executed deaths and a recurring nightmare in the form of a sun-bleached, public beheading - the significance of which turns out to be twofold. It also has in spades what a good Argento giallo conveys like no other, that chilling feeling of something wholly alien on the loose in human form.",1237680000,24,3184,5.036053130929791
3683748,4,B001LIK8DO,"Well alrighty!  It took almost 4 decades to catch 4 Flies, but here it is!  This is a very solid conclusion to Argento's Animal trilogy.  It just might be my favorite of the three.

Roberto is an up-and-coming musician.  One night he confronts a stranger that had apparently been stalking him.  There's a bit of a struggle, an accidental murder, and someone watching with a camera.  Ohhh snap, let the mind games begin....

FOUR FLIES ON GREY VELVET is classic Argento stuff--atmospheric, suspenseful, clever camera shots, dark humor, creepy music, plus some stylistic, high-impact violence & blood splatter.  It all builds up into one heckuva interesting and layered giallo like only Dario can deliver.",1237680000,2,703,5.0964912280701755
3683749,5,B001LIK8DO,"For a very long time, I thought I would have to order an European release of ""Four Flies on Grey Velvet"" in the PAL format.  Thankfully, it is now available in the United States in the NTSC format from Mya Communications.  It was worth the wait.  ""Four Flies on Grey Velvet"" is a superb giallo (murder mystery) from the Italian Hitchcock, Dario Argento; his other giallo masterpieces include ""Deep Red"" (my favorite), ""The Bird with the Crystal Plumage,"" and ""Tenebre.""

  A persistent theme runs through most of Argento's earlier gialli:  Appearances can be very deceiving.  Many of his main characters are very artistic; they consist of writers and musicians.  In his later, more high tech, gialli, they are members of the police force.  In ""Four Flies on Grey Velvet,"" Roberto Tobias (Michael Brandon) is a handsome, young musician who is being stalked.  He confronts and accidentally kills the stalker in an empty cathedral.  Someone wearing a creepy, kewpie doll mask (remember the horror hit ""Valentine""?) takes photographs of the incident.

  During a party at his home, Roberto finds the photographs.  Anyone could have planted them.  The maid, however, knows who it is.  She tries blackmailing the masked person.  Unfortunately, the maid is killed at a park while running through a maze of tall, narrow stone walls and hedges - a great chase scene reminiscent of Mario Bava's ""Baron Blood,"" which was released one year later.  Indeed, ""Four Flies on Grey Velvet"" has some creative death sequences.  No two victims are dispatched in the same manner.  There is a stabbing, a bludgeoning, and a death by drug injection.

  The acting is good.  Mimsy Farmer, an American, found fame in Italian gialli.  (Armando Crispino`s ""Autopsy"" is one of her most famous.)  She is Roberto's wealthy, distraught wife, Mina Tobias.  Francine Racetta is a gorgeous brunette; she plays Dalia, Mina's cousin who easily seduces the vulnerable Roberto.  Jean-Pierre Marielle is fun to watch as the colorful homosexual detective, Gianni Arosio, who has never been able to guess the killer's identity until now.

  A beautiful musical score has been provided by the famous Ennio Morricone who scored many of Clint Eastwood's Spaghetti Westerns and a host of gialli from other Italian directors.  Morricone scored all of Argento's earlier gialli until the two parted company.  Then the rock band Goblin began playing the music.  Argento is famous for his masterful camera work and lavish set productions.  (He was greatly influenced by his mentor, Mario Bava.)  This is all evident by the masterful restoration performed by Mya Communications.  Video and audio quality are excellent.  The film is presented in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 2.35:1.  Italian mono is provided but there are no English subtitles.  Some scenes during the killer's explanation were never dubbed in English and have English subtitles.  I wish, like Blue Underground's release of ""Deep Red,"" that English subtitles had been provided throughout the film during the Italian mono.

  Maya Communications has provided a gallery of posters and lobby cards.  There is a restored theatrical trailer from Italy.  The American trailers (television and theatrical) are not restored.  There is no commentary from the director or from anyone else.

  Needless to say, ""Four Flies on Grey Velvet"" is essential viewing for all fans of Dario Argento and fans of Italian gialli.  It has a few twists to keep everyone happy.  The explosive finale is awesome.",1236643200,6,3510,5.1512455516014235

These occur during scene transitions and include dialogue.  Also, the speed of the audio seems slowed down.  If you listen to Mimsy and Michael, their voices are way too deep compared to previous versions or films.  It sounds like they rushed this release once they got the exclusive rights instead of getting it perfect.  That is too bad.  This could have been the one.  It is not.

English language until the end where the restored scenes are in English subtitles. This one has a man who being tormented because he accidentally killed a man who was following him. When a few people start to figure out who the person that is tormenting Roberto (Michael Brandon) is, they get killed - in light-moderate gory ways. This one is easy to figure out who the killer is. There aren't really a lot of red herrings in this one. It is a very good movie but to me it is still the least of the animal trilogy (Cat O Nine Tails and Bird with the Crystal Plumage). I just found the characters to be a little weaker and the fact that the killer wasn't hard to figure out. There are a few genuinely creepy moments in this - a great scene where a lady is trapped in her home and you know she's going to get it, there is no music as she quietly tries to hide. I am saying a lady here and avoiding trying to not be a spoiler reviewer here. What I will say that whoever you think the killer is verified with this scene. It just became too obvious.
This movie isn't overly gory ala Suspiria or Deep Red. There is some gore, but nothing really super graphically gory.
This movie is worth owning because it really is well done even though I personally like his other ones better,but Four Flies is a superior effort compared to Stendhal Syndrome, Phantom of the Opera and Dario Argento's more recent movies. In my opinion his older movies are just superior and he is worthy of being called the Italian Hitchcock.",1235520000,6,1671,4.393548387096774

Also check out Argento's Door Into Darkness tv show that will be released soon. Thank God we didn't order that on a bootleg. Four Flies!",1232236800,3,439,4.641025641025641

3683755,5,B001LIK8DO,"I will not say anything about the film which I have relished since its original theatrical release except that if you are an Argento aficionado, 4 Flies is a must see! It's spooky and creepy and gorgeously photographed. The story is intriguing and you'll be stunned at the brilliant way Dario shows you WHAT the 4 flies are and unmasks the killer whose motivation is so askew you'll be speechless. The comic relief is amusing, the supporting roles are well done. You'll love the gay detective. This is only December 30, but I'm panting to see this film again in its true color glory as opposed to the miserable pirate editions in which much action in the night scenes is obscured. Of the 3 films in the ""animal trilogy"", this is my very favorite.

""Never officially released on DVD, Dario Argento's classic Four Flies on Grey Velvet finally returns on February 24th, fully uncut and with an astounding picture and sound quality.

Long and accurate restoration work was made directly on the original negative elements which had remained untouched for more than 30 years. Extras will include: Teaser trailer, Original trailer, English opening and closing credits and extensive poster and photo gallery.""

Yes,I'm looking forward to this release. I gave it five stars already. Just because it's an official release by MYA.

8318179,4,B001LIK8DO,"Dario Argento's 1971 giallo ""Four Flies on Grey Velvet"" closes out what is often dubbed as his ""animal"" trilogy which was preceded by his 1969 directorial debut ""The Bird with the Crystal Plumage"" and 1971's ""The Cat O' Nine Tails"". While my least favorite of the three films, it still is well worth checking out for fans of the legendary Italian auteur.

""Four Flies on Grey Velvet"" was released in a region free NTSC 40th anniversary blu-ray edition by Shameless and to date is the best release of the film available. Remastered from the original camera negative and presented in its original 2.35:1 aspect ratio, the film looks better than ever. Shameless however decided for some reason to put the film on a single layer disc and as a result the average bit rate only gets up to about 20 mbps during busy sections. I am not sure why they didn't go with a dual layer disc release and max out the bit rate to help the picture quality even more. But what is presented here looks quite nice regardless. Detail is great with a natural film grain structure. The only drawback was some black crush I saw in some nighttime scenes but that is a small quibble. Both the English and Italian audio tracks are available in lossless quality sounding quite clean and punchy. English subtitles are provided for the hearing impaired.

Extras include the ability to watch the film with about a minute of small additional footage presented as standard definition inserts. Other goodies are both the English & Italian trailers, alternate opening & closing credits, a photo gallery, and an interview with the assistant director Luigi Cozzi which runs a lengthy 42 minutes.

While the decision by Shameless to not put the film on a dual layer disc with a higher bit rate is puzzling, everything else about this release is first rate. Fans of Dario Argento should not think twice about adding it to their collection. While not one of his best films in my opinion, it is still a lot of fun.",1520035200,,1970,4.671469740634006

8318182,4,B001LIK8DO,"The last in a supposed animal trilogy, Four Flies on Grey Velvet is pretty good.  It further establishes some themes and techniques typical of Argento.  It's fairly campy, an odd mix still obviously concerned with aspects of the sexual revolution yet a few contemporary versions of stock characters from Italian drama offer a little comedy.  Likewise, close filming along with unusual perspectives (like from inside the body of a guitar) abound.

Argento's film techniques have improved by this third movie.  Four Flies keeps moving from the beginning instead of taking overlong in the first few scenes to build the story.  Overall the visuals are more sophisticated with more believable f/x.  The screenplay leaves much to be desired, however.  One glaring inconsistency was a storyline that gets attributed to the murderer but that should perhaps have been a subplot with a blackmailer.  The scene provided a great visual impact as well as the tension of moral ambiguity that was, well, left ambiguous.  The final act and revelation, similarly dramatic, felt contrived, the final scene a bit ridiculous.

But, hey, this is only a horror film after all.  And what's not to love about having access to foreign horror movies?",1508630400,,1224,5.126262626262626
