4620710,2,B00598O9RI,"When I saw a new Charlie Chan cover illustration, I thought: At last! The remaining unreleased Chan films are finally out...but no, it's just a reissue of things already available. Where are THE RED DRAGON, SHADOWS OVER CHINATOWN, THE DOCKS OF NEW ORLEANS, THE SHANGHAI CHEST, THE GOLDEN EYE, THE FEATHERED SERPENT and THE SKY DRAGON? When they turn up, I'll buy them. But I've already got everything that's been released.",1316563200,100,422,4.957746478873239
4620711,3,B00598O9RI,"I am a big fan of Charlie Chan whether it is Warner Oland or Sidney Toler. This particular set is a double dip from an earlier release (The Chanthology)and is missing Meeting at Midnight, the sixth Chan in that set. These were made at Monogram studios (someone correct me if I'm wrong) after the bigger studio let the Chan series drop (Warner Bros.?). The point being that the chintzy-ness of the studio budget really shows in these productions. Sets, lighting, etc. - everything is second-rate. The Mantan Moreland edge to comedy may strike viewers as offensive and the other Chan sidekicks are not always great. I own these because I own all the Chans (even the other set that is offered here) which is even worse. But if you are a fan of the 30's/40's mystery series such as Wong, Moto, the Saint and the Thin Man, then you will probably want these in your collection.",1314144000,39,871,4.589743589743589

4620738,4,B00598O9RI,"This not a review of this box particularly, but to other reviewers' incorrect comments.  One said Meeting at Midnight had nt come out, but this is totally incorrect.  When MGM brought the only set about 10years ago, Meeting at Midnight was in that collection, but under a different title, ""Black Magic.""  Unless you can find these Sidney Toler ( with Mantan Moreland) out of print or at a Half-Price Book Store, you are probably out of luck.  Second, all of the Warner Oland versions ER released by 20th Century Fox since they made them, beginning with 1931's ""The Black Camel"" through ""Monte Carlo.""  These were all remastered to get the production for DVDs showing and each or most had some featurette which ranged to a discussion by several CC experts as well as Kay Linaker (Phillips) who, sadly passed away since these were brought.  Also no longer availed.  These are the best yet in production quality, an extra on all of the disks, and that the had all of the Warner Oland available.  Remember, five CCs are lost forever except for The Black Camel, the second Oland film as well as his fourth.  After his death in 1948, they hired Sidney Toler for the role, which if not for the difference in their attitudes--Oland's warmth with Number One Son, Lee, portrayed by Keye Luke.  Then when Toler bought the rights to continue, the only studio that would film them was Monogram Studios--a thir-d, if not a fourth ranked studio, cheap in sets and everything imaginable.

Finally, and many will disagree and some agree, that the Roland Winters CC portrayals are the worst and very cheaply made, the are still important to a nearly-complete collection to probably the greatest set of movies, whether considered A or B movies or even ""C""-level, it's great to see them again.  During the lean years years of the 1940's, Toler,and most especially kept Fox Films, later 20th Century Fox afloat.  More of the movie goers went to see the CC film and watched the ""A"" film because they were always there.  WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE FILMS LOST IN THE FOX FILM FIRE, and the last two which were simply not (or not yet put on DVD) because restoration is too much to save or the studios it wasn't worth the cost, these are very important to save for pleasure of watching them.  I go from Oland's ""The Black Camel"" through the total end of the total series, including the ""Eran Trece"" twice a year, they are absolutely fun to watch.

Mr. Moto might have gone longer, but a Japanese hero, played by a Hungarian actor, was not a good message from the studios regarding the attack on PH by the Japanese.

Regardless of the quality of all these DVDs, they are well worth buying.  Just be very careful to avoid duplication of any others you might own.",1421020800,,2733,4.6231884057971016

I'm pretty happy with the 30's genre, and have always loved Chan, especially the Toler and Oland portrayers.

Where is Black Camel?  In my opinion the best Chans were At the Olympics. Castle in the Desert, In Egypt, Wax Museum and the double named Black Magic/Meeting at Midnight.
Mantan Moreland , to me, represented the kids (me in the 50's) who were frightenend by seances, Egyptian myths, and wax figures,etc.

I have bought a lot of movies from Amazon and this is the first time this has happened. Luckily I also purchased a 3 movie set which contained The Chinese Cat and this one played okay.

So I tend to review these movies strictly as being a Chan movie, not comparing them to other movies. These movies are from the 1944 and 1945 with 4 of the 5 directed by Phil Rosen. The scripts are typical Chan fare, features Charlie Chan and his quotes as in all of the movies. The Chinese Cat and The Scarlet Clue being the most interesting of the 5(although I love them all as I have stated). Sidney Toler is in all of them and he only made 4 more of these films before he was unable to continue the role. The set over all is a good one and the price on these was fantasic. I have a total of 20 of these films on DVD and another 5 that I had taped when they were on TCM. These are not as good as Treasure Island, Wax Museum, Castle in the Desert and Murder Over New York which are my favorites but they are still very fun to watch. I recommend the set to anyone but a must for Chan fans. And yes, I tend to like Sidney Toler over Warner Oland although Oland's At The Opera was outstanding with Boris Karloff in the cast. The actor Roland Winters took over for Mr. Toler and does a OK job, by then the scripts and production values diminished badly.",1348358400,4,1300,3.946768060836502
4620794,5,B00598O9RI,"The Chan films in this small collection have been wonderfully restored.  These are some of the post war films starring Sidney Toler.  The set includes 5 films on 2 dvds.  Although there are no extras (trailers etc), the quality of the presentation is outstanding with great images and clear sound. There are two other Chan collections available and this set rounds out the series. If you like the later Chan films, be sure to get this set.",1343779200,12,439,4.675324675324675
4620795,5,B00598O9RI,"An outfit called TGG Direct has been licensing MGM/UA titles for reissue on DVD, and this is one of their first packages.  The first 6 Monogram Chan films were originally released in a box set entitled Chanthology back in the mid-2000s, with each movie on a separate disc.  This set presents only 5 of the films over 2 single sided discs.  The discs are enclosed in two Amray cases inside an outer cardboard box.  Both discs appear to be dual-layered, and the transfers are identical to those previously released.  As these potboilers run barely an hour each, the programs are well contained on the dual layer discs with no compression problems.  No extras are included, but none were seen on the original single-disc editions, either.

Disc 1 features IN THE SECRET SERVICE, THE CHINESE CAT, and THE JADE MASK.  Disc 2 features THE SCARLET CLUE and THE SHANGHAI COBRA.  Both discs feature a simple menu allowing you to select the movie to be played.

For those who missed out on the Chanthology set, this is a great value for a fraction of the cost. A big upside is that you can see these films with fewer disc changes, which for such short films is quite a bonus.

The downside is that they inexplicably did not include BLACK MAGIC (aka MEETING AT MIDNIGHT).  It would have easily been accommodated on disc 2.  It is the only title that is in the public domain, so perhaps that had something to do with its omission.  Even so, MGM/UA's print is far superior than any public domain elements for that title that I've seen.  Moves like this really baffle me and make one wonder if these companies even know what the Hell they're licensing. Collectors who buy these sets generally want ALL of the available titles.  In this case, not 5 out of 6 films!

Anyway, I can highly recommend this set despite the omission of BLACK MAGIC",1340323200,21,1826,4.58641975308642
4620796,4,B00598O9RI,"I love the packaging; the box is easy to handle and very nice.  It's a box with a lid, making it very easy to store and handle without the DVD's falling out.

However, there are no bonus features or subtitles.  The DVD's are single-sided, unlike some of the Fox volumes.  This is a set that's ideal for people who grew up with these films who just want to watch the movies and aren't very technology friendly.  The restoration isn't nearly so nice as the five Fox volumes, but they're tolerable.",1335398400,,495,4.455555555555556
4620797,3,B00598O9RI,"I too am surprised that only five of the six films in the Chanthology are in this set.  I'm guessing the reason for the re-release is that the Chanthology has been out of print for a few years. I got it for Xmas a couple of years ago. The person who got it had to buy a used one online. Warner Bros probably wants to get in on the renewed interest in the Chan series following the success of the Fox releases. Fox did a great job on the Chans it released. They cleaned up dark spots from damaged film and stabilized shaky parts, among other things. They also included great documentaries on each disc. Unfortunately Fox doesn't own the Monogram Chans. It would be great if they could get a hold of them and give those films a proper treatment. Or perhaps Warner Bros should turn the project over to people who really love old films like these and want to mimic Fox's efforts. MGM released the Chanthology and TCM/Warner Bros the other Monogram set.",1329955200,,948,4.386363636363637

I click on that listing & go to Amazon and all of a sudden I see a price of $999.00! You have got to be kidding. I have loved every Charlie Chan I have purchased on Amazon, but this will never be for me. How in the world the price could inflate that much is beyond me.

I thought....Finally...at last....the remaining Monogram Charlie Chan films have been released from our friends at TCM but this is just a reissue of the first Monogram Chan films which everyone already owns.
Are they going to screw this up like they did with the Fox Movie Channel?
The Fox Movie Channel was almost like Turner Classic Movies when it first went on the air....Then some young Executive decided to showcase the same more recent movies over and over again.
What could these people be thinking?
Do they really get up in the morning with a brainstorm that everyone wants to see the same damn more recent movies over and over again?
They continue to show this terrible version of ""Around The World in 80 Days"" that no one has ever heard of....and they show it over and over again.
Why not show some of those great ""B"" films like they did a dozen years ago?
I attempted to contact the Fox Movie Channel but they obviously ignored my opinion.
Thank God we have Turner Classic Movies.
I can't wait for TCM to release volume 2 of the Charlie Chan spotlight DVD set to include the remaining Monogram Charlie Chan films.",1318377600,38,1157,4.676470588235294
4620801,3,B00598O9RI,"To the earlier poster, it was Fox that dropped the Charlie  Chan series in WWII.  A lot of the majors dropped their B movie divisions during the war.  Mr Moto ended in 1939 while Sherlock Holmes only after two movies was dropped in 1940 only to be picked up by Universal.  Which was B studio during the war with A&C.

Does anybody what company is releasing the movies as MGM own(ed?) the rights?  The packaging screams Mill Creek or a public domain company so don't expect a legitamate remastering or any extras.  I know TCM/Warners released Chan four movies as well so did MGM sell part of the catalogue or they just leasing the movies out to other distributors?  There is similar package for Vincent Price (mostly the Corman/Poe movies) that was also owned by MGM.  I would like to know.",1316563200,8,789,4.539007092198582

He strides briskly and confidently through them with screen presence and star power. ""Secret Service"" is a good example of how 1940's film companies could produce a cheaply made, but well-made, mystery movie. ""Chinese Cat"" is an entertaining little b-mystery with plenty of fog and secret passages. Picture quality is OK on all of these. But one thing puzzles me: the price on this box yo-yo's up and down a lot. I was fortunate to purchase it at a discount price on the lower end of its price roller-coaster so maybe I am a bit biased as to the relative value of this set.",1444521600,,719,4.669291338582677
