3971861,1,B002RABPC8,"It's not funny. He screams, for the first five minutes in Spanish. Then he screams in the microphone about stuff that is NOT funny. I suffered through the entirte DVD waiting for it to get funny and it never did. He screams alot, and then screams more. It's very annoying. It's more like a commentary about how great he thinks he is. I can't for the life of me figure out how this guy got famous. Oh, did I mention that he screams his material for the entire performance, most of the time about how great he thinks he is?",1269475200,,521,4.22
3971862,4,B002RABPC8,this was a good one too.  i'm a fan of his but his stand up is getting a little repetitive it seems like he's using the same jokes on all his DVDs.,1267488000,,147,3.59375
3971863,5,B002RABPC8,"I loved this DVD!  It's his best performance yet!  The reason why is because his jokes are even less politically correct than in his other stand-up performances, and because he tends to focus on race relations between Mexicans and Latinos and European Americans.  The combination of these two factors made for a powerful, raw and extremely funny show.  It's also wonderful to see how a loved Mexican comedian now has enough roots in the industry, fans and confidence to pull off the jokes that he makes in this show.  In hindsight, it was like watching my favorite comedian fully come out of his shell and finally break free from the societal restraints that had in part kept his jokes w/in certain limits.  In other words, after I watched a rerun of this show on HBO, I realized that I had just seen a particularly historical show with respect to George Lopez's career.  After a show like this, you'll be wondering about and looking forward to his next show, new jokes and next move in his career.",1266451200,11,998,4.636363636363637
3971864,5,B002RABPC8,"Wow!

My husband has always been a major George Lopez fan.  It didn't take me long to become one as well

I didn't know what to get my husband for Christmas.  This released at exactly the right time, and my husband was really happy when he opened this gift.

I normally don't laugh out loud at anyone, but George Lopez is seriously funny.  I did a lot of laughing out loud with this one!",1265846400,12,387,4.162162162162162

I will never spend a penny on him again, and I am most sure, that after this performance he will NEVER sell out any stadium in America!  HBO should be ashamed that they gave this ignorant slime ball a forum on which to spurt his disgusting propaganda.",1265328000,8,426,4.234567901234568
3971866,1,B002RABPC8,"I like George Lopez a lot. I watch his comedy shows and enjoyed his tv show while it was on the air. I was however, very disappointed with his new DVD, George Lopez, Tall, Dark and Chicano. I bought two DVD's, one for me and one to give to my godson as a X-Mas gift.  After watching my DVD at home I was disappointed as to how much time George Lopez spends on this  DVD on the topic of masturbation. I was embarrassed that I had bought this dvd for my godson as a gift and called my godson to apologize for the bad taste in this gift selection.  I would not recommend this DVD to anyone and my own DVD has ended in the trash. George Lopez, comedy needs to be funny not gross!!!!!!",1264982400,6,680,4.022222222222222
3971867,3,B002RABPC8,I bought two as Christmas presents and also took my family to see him live.  DVD was repeat of his December appearance at Nokia.  BORING!,1264809600,3,137,4.44
3971868,2,B002RABPC8,"I really like George Lopez and I think he is funny. I feel this new DVD gives an incorrect image of the latino people. Most of us do not say 3 or 4 bad words per sentence and we respect authority, if we do not agree with some laws, we do not irrespect the people who enforce them. We vote them out on elections, even if we do not get them out.
I used to share my DVD's with my american friends, but now I am afraid my image of a professional and educated latino will be tarnished.
George Lopez is able to make people laugh without bad words and irrespect, he is really a good comedian and he should pursue to make a cleaner show where latinos are seen in their real light.
George: Please clean up, there is some of us who want to see real clean comedy.",1264550400,5,752,4.02
3971869,1,B002RABPC8,"Watched this last night.  Love George Lopez's tv show, both the sitcom and sometimes the talk show, but this one left a bad taste in my mouth.  Lots of profanity (both in English and Spanish) and he seemed to be too angry to be funny in a lot of places.  If you like George, watch the sitcom with your family, and skip this video.",1264464000,5,330,4.125

i watched George Lopez new stand up comedy on HBO which was live in La Vernia, Texas. His Comedy is fantastic. Grant it his comedy has bad langauge in it and can get really gritty about the subjects he talks about, however he gets everyone laughing with his comedy. he makes fun of his own culture, makes fun of white americans, makes fun of his family too and the situations that he has been through in his life. he really got me laughing when he made fun of Lee Greenwood's Song Proud To Be An American the republican party's national anthem. if you like stand up comedy with grit and colorful language as Spock mentioned in several star trek movies, then this dvd is for you.  the reason i rate this movie 5 stars is George Lopez is entertaining and funny. also i rated this movie 5 stars because George is flawless in his physical and verbal humour.  George Lopez: Tall Dark & Chicano is his best stand up comedy so far, and now he has his own late night show on tbs. i laughed throughout the whole show on HBO.  Anyone that can get me laughing deserves a great rating.  la Siempre Chicano America.",1257811200,13,1284,4.981308411214953
3971871,1,B002RABPC8,"I had to turn this off about 12 minutes into it. I had not laughed once and just could not be bothered to see if the rest was any better. I did not think it was racist. Lopez made fun of Latinos as much as he did white America (in the first 12 minutes, anyway.) There was a couple of times when I thought ""I could've written a better punch line than that.""",1494979200,2,356,3.8904109589041096

3971926,3,B002RABPC8,"Overall:  disappointing, offensive & bitter.  Looking back on George Lopez's brilliant career, this performance had only fleeting moments of comedy.  I've been a fan of Lopez - the COMIC - since the beginning.  But I am not a fan of his bitter, angry political rants, which his recent performances have degenerated into. ""Tall, Dark & Chicano"" makes me cringe with Lopez's bitter, hate-filled, anti-Anglo racist, mysogynistic, immature sex-masturbation-farts-qweefs obsessions.  I understand and have total empathy w/ the societal sources of Lopez's bitterness.  But, at this point in his stellar career, he needs to decide if he's going to be a politician or a comic, because as a bitter COMIC (falling back on cheap, filthy, sex- and bodily-functions obsessed references to sprinkle a few laughs in his routine), he's just not funny any more.",1480464000,6,844,5.30827067669173

In addition, geniuses, why don't YOU all go back to your homelands if you are offended by the rights of ALL American's to question authority and practice free speech?  If you are able, read the handwriting, then tell me how many comics of ANY color could fill a damn STADIUM, and command that size stage, the way George did?

If his show seemed more like a political rally, it was.  Mark my words, George will be running for office when the time is right, and will probably win.

I was blown away by his unapologetic attitude, and sharp, incisive, BRILLIANT writing and performance. He does what all good comics do, he educates his audience.  If his social commentary was not right on, it would not be funny.  As one other 5 star reviewer put it, his humor is ""raw"".

He survived poverty and abuse by making it funny.  He is a minority that has gained success because he is fearless.

He looked so uncomfortable most of the time, shrugging his shoulders and screaming into the mike...frankly I quit it after 34 minutes.  I have never seen or heard this side of the man, but his success has NOTHING to do with a Supreme Court Justice! He seems to think he is on par with one. Hardly. I wanted to see his stand up act, not listen to a comic blast the political pundits with no break.

George was very negative about many issues.  He normally is a great observer of our society and the way things are in reality.  George showed a much darker side this time.  I'm sure he is happy with his show, I was not.",1403740800,8,363,4.358208955223881

3972095,2,B002RABPC8,"I laughed a few times, but not really worth watching. A good portion of the act is him making fun of white and black people. He also said many things in Spanish that I couldn't understand. I usually like his stuff and  I wasn't impressed with this movie.",1401667200,,254,4.291666666666667

3972100,1,B002RABPC8,"I used to be a huge fan of George Lopez until I saw this special. When I watched this special, I was expecting to hear more of his funny jokes in regards to how a traditional Mexican household works (I can relate to a lot of what he said as I am a Mexican-American.) Instead of laughs and giggles, the first 10 minutes of the special has left me feeling DISGUSTED! REALLY DISGUSTED! It was nothing but George Lopez expressing his hatred towards Caucasians. Not only did this special get too political to be funny (it wasn't ""George Carlin political"" funny), but his racist rants were too much for me to handle. Somehow it's okay for him to bash white people, but if the roles were reversed, you know that person would be in hot water!

George Lopez, I have lost all respect of you and as a result, you have officially lost a fan.",1386720000,4,829,4.348387096774194

3972113,5,B002RABPC8,"I saw the HBO special and was laughing the whole time reminds me of my childhood and what it was like growing up Chicano. I could watch it over and over again.

The humor in this video is for more mature audience compared to his other videos.  In  this video George does speak more Spanish then he usually does in his other videos. Also the video was shot at a time when the politics were not favorable for the Latino community so he does have a lot of ""opinions"" about that. Just keep in mind this is stand up comedy and is not to be taken so seriously or personal.

If you are easily offended by racial stereotyping this video is not for you!
I understand it may not be too funny for people who don't identify or have been in close contact with the Latino culture.  many of the jokes and situations he talks about have to do with the Latino/Chicano lifestyle.",1338854400,,861,4.257668711656442

3972116,1,B002RABPC8,"I usually avoid watching this comedian as I feel he is very racist and it becomes tiresome to hear him constantly defending his race and saying why they should stay in United States, even though they are illegally here.  Then he has the gall to make fun of our long-time customs here in United states.  He cannot talk about food without making reference to bodily functions such as burritos are not good unless they make you ""fart.""  Also complains of restaurants here named Border this or Border that, insinuating that we want them to leave our country.  If he is so very offended by our attitude and customs, why does he not encourage Hispanics to leave United States and go back to their native country.

He seems proud of these people who are only able to cook food, clean hotel rooms and work on farms picking our fruit.  He also makes constant reference to how much the men drink and always making ""clunkers"" out of their cars, as though this is something to be proud of.  Also says Hispanic men are not romantic and evidently do not care of they make their women happy.  Then ironically, he makes statement that white men are taking the Hispanic women away, because they care about their (women) feelings and try harder to make them happy in bed.  Well George, you just don't get it, do you???

No this performance is vulgar, repetitive from other shows, racist and not even very funny.  I would never recommend buying this unless your mind resides in the gutter anyway.  Then I suppose it would be appropriate for you.",1304294400,9,1526,4.590405904059041

3972118,1,B002RABPC8,"I found this album to be highly offensive and racist.  Lopez is unnecessarily confrontational and continually emphasizes cultural differences rather than tolerance.

3972119,2,B002RABPC8,"Lopez is super funny in most of his stand up, but in this one he starts off strong and then he's just trying to be funny towards the end to fill time; might be show of decline in his material.

Towards the end of this act he goes beyond making fun of white people, and is totally bitter or something trying to make it all racial.  He seems to have forgotten that if it wasn't for Sandra Bullock (white), he wouldn't be up on that stage.  Then he gets all crazy saying mexicans do everything for whites (maybe there in his gated community w/Justin Timberlake), and at low hourly rates.  True about the $$, but in the end they're making ok money considering the fact they don't get taxed on it...

I think we need a new Chicano comedian to rise up and take the spotlight.  Maybe one less hypocritical & whitewashed, and that'll make fun of all and all alike.",1269648000,7,856,4.285714285714286
