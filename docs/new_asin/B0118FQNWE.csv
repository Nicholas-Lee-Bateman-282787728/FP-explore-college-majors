7329748,5,B0118FQNWE,"I have purchased this box set on eBay and am very happy with what I have received. I was able to verify the UPC code on www.rapidfinder.ca  whoever is saying that these ""orange box sets"" are fakes and just popped up in the wake of the recent news of Warner Bros to ban the confederate flag on June 23rd has clearly not done their research. These box sets were produced earlier in 2015 and released before Warner Bros decided to stop producing confederate merchandise, making these collector items. My box set as well as  the one my friend purchased from the same seller were both wrapped, unopened with all 7 seasons and 2 additional feature films still wrapped inside, came in a nice solid boxset, had valid UPC code, Warner Bros. logo and copyright. They are authentic boxsets no doubt about it.",1439510400,20,797,4.605633802816901

7329750,5,B0118FQNWE,"this is a great box set at a great deal and all the disc's play really nice too great clear picture! regardless of the negative reviews on being a fake box set, reliving my childhood in one day. but i think this set was made in Canada has the Canadian rating logo on all the disc covers, only dislike i have  is how the disc lay on top of each other in there cases i just lay a sheet of soft  toilet tissue in between discs prevent scratching works great and it does have the WB logo on the back and the box is very well made very awesome set",1438732800,5,542,3.918181818181818

7329752,5,B0118FQNWE,I love this series about two country boys on probation for running moonshine and the government makes a deal that as long as they do not make any more the boys will  not go to prison but put on probation.  Each episode starts out simple but very shortly the Duke boy cousins are in trouble that they do not have anything to do with and have to find the culprit before they sent to jail for the crimes committed. The Duke family lives on a farm and the Duke cousins Bo and Luke created the General Lee car that they use when they know there will be trouble and it is the fastest car in Hazzard Country.  The boys are always keeping the car tuned up and repairing when it breaks down.  They are always on the look out for the sheriff who is always trying to ticket them for speeding or other traffic violations and the country commission is always trying to get them in trouble that will send them to prison but they always spoil his plans and he ends up losing money or able to escape from being caught by disassociating himself from the real criminals.  This is a great family friendly show.,1483056000,,1091,4.276699029126213

7329755,5,B0118FQNWE,"Great package, but I found that I couldn't watch them all, there are just too many even over the course of several weeks.  After awhile I actually got tired of them, can you believe it?  Nice to have them all and I'll watch the other half next year, maybe.  Only so much yeehaw...  that you can take.  Great set though.",1459987200,3,319,4.25

Best I could find near us was like $150 for just the seasons. It was amazing to find this for the cheaper price, AND includes two movies. My husband is so proud, and LOVES this pack!!

8723805,5,B0118FQNWE,"Dear WB USA:
 What Kind Of Crack Have You Been Smoking? You Can't Change History By Banning It.  As I Understand It, This Item Is NOT Available For Sale In The USA Because Of PC Issues Over The Confederate Flag. It Makes Absolutely No Sense To Me Why One Of Your Most Popular Old Tv Shows Is Not Being Sold Here Just Because A Few Feathers Are Being Ruffled. Thank The Gods That Amazon Canada Has No Such Nonsensical Restrictions, And Has No Compunction About Selling it To Us Here In The USA. It Runs in at About $135 US, Roughly About $12 - $13 A Season, A Fair Price, Even Here In The USA, So Getting It From Canada Doesn't Really Make That Much Difference, And A Good Way To Avoid The PC Nonsense Here In The Good O'L USA... Yee Haw!",1488672000,6,737,4.146853146853147
