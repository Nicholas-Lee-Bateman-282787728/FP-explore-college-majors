7812288,5,6301536029,"I've owned a VHS copy of this film for many years and always enjoy watching it. The movie begins in 1869 on the eve of the Franco-Prussian War, 1870-71 (one of the conflicts which helped with German Unification), which is likely unknown, nor of interest, to a vast majority of Americans. Thankfully I am not one of them.

The film might be seen as ""boring' if all you are interested in seeing is constant scene of combat and carnage. While there is a very intense battle scene and scenes of the aftermath  of battle, there are many deeply moving and intensely human moments in this beautifully filmed movie. As mentioned on the sleeve, it is very reminiscent of Stephen Crane's ""The Red Badge of Courage"". Unlike Henry Fleming who probably volunteered to serve during the Civil War, Pierre Naboulet had no illusions of military glory, he joined the army in order to help his family (tenant farmers) with the money he received for selling his ""lucky"" lottery number which exempt him from military conscription. I do not think he had any idea or desire of being caught up in a war and really just wanted to serve his 5 years, go home and marry the lovely red-haired Henriette.",1428624000,,1174,4.639423076923077

It is very much an 1980's French arthouse film chock full of  symbolism framed by a truly bizarre soundtrack that seems to be characteristic of this genre. The story is extremely static and the characters fit the bill. It IS beautifully filmed, though, and for that I can at least give it two stars,but not a farthing more! THE RETURE OF MARTIN GUERRE IS FAR SUPERIOR FILM.",1171411200,,636,4.781818181818182
7812291,4,6301536029,"This movie is probably best compared to ""Revolution"" (1985).  It's the kind of film it seems to have great potential and the viewer will exit the film either tear-struck or incredibly disappointed.  The first impression of the film, (implied by the cover and possibly the title), one would suspect this is primarily a war film.
  Through the entire film, there is only one battle; a few other confrontations, a few chases, a few hostile takeovers, but only one battle.  This story takes places during the Franco-Prussian War (1870-1871) and to my knowledge this is one of the few, if not the only, films that takes place during this war.  The story follows a poor farmer named Pierre who joins the French Army which is at the brink of war with Prussia.  After their first battle, Pierre accidentally gets separated from his battalion and is lost behind enemy lines.  While in this predicament, he comes across a small boy.  Being a sympathetic and slightly emotional person, Pierre takes this boy under his wing as he tries to find his way home.
  The battle scene is not exactly epic, nor is it all that long, although I must admit, this skirmish is a lot more interesting than the ""epic"" battle scenes in the 1954 version of ""Napoleon"".  After watching this film, you get the impression that this was not really meant to be a war movie.  It is more like ""Cold Mountain"" in the aspect that war is the backdrop, there are battles, you're following a lost soldier, but its more about his journeys outside of the military; the journey home.
  The scenery, costumes, and landscapes are quite eye-appealing in this movie.  The acting, while lacking the dramatic fervor of ""A Few Good Men"", is exceptional.
  Unlike some films, one of this movie's strongest features is the ending.  I'm not going to give it away, but the ending is not uncommon is these kind of movies, but there is more depth to it than meets the eye.  I enjoy this ending a lot more than that of most movies.
  Overall, if you're the kind of person who enjoys movies not entirely oriented on battles so much as the journey of an individual soldier, I would recommend this film.",1074556800,2,2141,4.638297872340425
