8289917,1,B001CUB6BE,bad. horrible.  Doesn't really talk about the touristy spots along the way that make route 66 interesting.  Talks only about a boring history of the road....not impressed with this History Channel documentary.,1431648000,,209,5.5

8289920,5,B001CUB6BE,"If YOU lived along, or travelled ON ""The Mother Road"", you'll just HAVE to have this.
Filled with historic footage---and classic trucks and cars---these fifty-minutes will be
over FAR to soon. I enjoyed EVERY minute!

HIGHLY recommended video. Excellent audio and video [my TV is 55""].",1411171200,,285,5.195652173913044
8289921,4,B001CUB6BE,"As with many History Channel documentaries, I learned quite a bit about the subject matter.  However, for the $24.95 that I paid, I expected quite a bit more.",1389916800,,158,4.642857142857143
8289922,5,B001CUB6BE,"When I was 14 I travelled Rt 66 with my parents. As young as I was it felt very special to me and I never forgot it. I saw this video on the History Channel and when it came available for purchase, I bought it.

Actually, I bought it as a gift for my husband because he's travelled it also and we both felt a connection to that road.  We have friends in Flagstaff, AZ and they live just minutes from 66 that still runs through town -- always a pleasure to be there. We love this DVD because it gives history, pictures, and memories of a great time.",1243468800,15,548,4.018348623853211
