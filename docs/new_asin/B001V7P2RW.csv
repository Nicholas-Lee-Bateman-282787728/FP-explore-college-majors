8345548,4,B001V7P2RW,"This movie was pretty good. Had a sort of good twist and good story line. Subtitled in English easy to read. DVD took a while in shipping, longer than expected but I think it came from outside US. The DVD case was broken during transit but the disc was OK. Visually this movie was great with lush scenes. I think most will like it.",1445904000,,331,4.1875
