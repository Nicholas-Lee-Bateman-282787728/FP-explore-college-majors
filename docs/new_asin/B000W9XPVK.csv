Satan always is saying - yea , did God really say ---, he never changes his tune, because it works so effectively.",1414972800,,310,4.618181818181818

8221946,1,B000W9XPVK,"As usuual, a single view perspective presents an unbalanced perspective.  This is the Michael Moore of religious attack videos.  Jesus taught moderation; truly investigate all sides and then reach a decision.  Otherwise you're guilty of the same hypocrisy this video accuses others of.",1271203200,3,285,5.5813953488372094

given several of the dvd out to family
and others (donated a dvd to my church's library).

This DVD exposes the false ""Christian"" religions
that abuse God's Word to control their congregation
and send them into legalism and NOT into God's grace.",1200960000,7,282,4.529411764705882
