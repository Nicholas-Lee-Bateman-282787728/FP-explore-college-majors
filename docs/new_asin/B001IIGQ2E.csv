8326509,2,B001IIGQ2E,"2 Stars for this video, it's marginal. I wanted this video since it came out in 2003. Took me a long time and a huge move across the country, (moving my entire blacksmithing shop) before I could get around to it. Finally broke down and spent the $30+ dollars on it. Let me first say that this is outstanding ergonomic advice for all blacksmiths. In fact this technique is so imperative that it should be required learning before you start smithing. The techniques Hofi employs will save you from damaging and debilitating pain in your fingers, wrist, elbow, shoulder, back and neck. Since blacksmithing isn't just a few years profession, but a lifetime, this is required learning so one doesn't hurt themselves over time with improper form and technique. In this realm the video is excellent.

The problem however is there is little demonstration of the technique in action, only a few short minutes watching Hofi forge a point. I would have liked to see Hofi actually use the technique on several projects so you can see more of it in action. It's easy to talk about technique and learn it but when you can't see much of it being used it's hard to get a sense of how to implement all the lessons learned. The other problem with the video seems like it didn't really know which it wanted to be, ergonomic instruction or smithing technique and it doesn't seem to complete either. I'd have liked to see 20-30 mins more of ergonomic instruction if this was just a video about holding, using, and implementing proper and safe hammer striking. If this was a video showing smithing then it's really at a loss since there is only a few minutes at most showing forging a point (albeit good instruction).

For $9.00 plus shipping this would be a great buy and every blacksmith on the planet should buy it, but at $30+ it's way to steep for the little bit of content that is touched. Hofi should really put this information on youtube because it's such vital and basic information to help newbies from hurting themselves instead of trying to cash in on this.

Make more extensive videos showing basic to advanced blacksmithing techniques with elaborate detail and those videos I'd buy at 30$ a pop, but this is just too short and too limited to be anywhere near worth the money. At $9 it would be a great buy and they could sell a million of these dvd's instead of selling a few hundred at $30 each.

Note: Make sure you have your audio set to stereo if you're watching this on a PC/Mac. Mine was set at quadriphonic and the intro was massively scratchy and Hofi was talking like Satan (deep and warped). Haha Once I set my computer settings/player settings to stereo output the audio was fine. Video quality is okay, but should be HD.",1420588800,,2725,4.577868852459017
8326510,3,B001IIGQ2E,meh.... it's not really a buy. If it had more actual content I could give it another star. It doesn't actually teach something substantial. Kind of want to say it's fishing for money.,1337299200,3,183,4.575757575757576
