nope, I get the sequel of the movie.
I had an event planned using the movie that I ordered and now the entire thing is canceled.",1353196800,,215,4.142857142857143
3513773,4,B001CK4FJY,"If you have seen the excellent Korean drama,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Korean-TV-Drama-2-pack-The-Grand-Chef-Vol-1-Vol-2/dp/B004K5AB0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Korean TV Drama 2-pack: The Grand Chef Vol 1 + Vol 2</a>&nbsp;with Kim Rae Won as Sung Chan, you may want to pass on this movie.  Both were inspired by the same Hur Young Man comic and 'The Grand Chef' (alternatively titled 'Gourmet') far surpasses the movie version.  As 'The Grand Chef' is one of my favorite Korean dramas and I think Kim Rae Won is fabulous as Sung Chan, I couldn't really get into the movie other than at the very end.  The casting is very different between the two versions.  Additionally, the plot line and characters were not really developed in the movie version.

If you have not seen 'The Grand Chef', I think this film may appeal to those interested in Korean culture and traditional Korean food.  However, I would still strongly suggest you see the drama as well.  It will definitely leave you looking for the nearest Korean restaurant or cookbook.

3513774,4,B001CK4FJY,"Didnt know what to expect. I love watching cooking shows like Top Chef and Food Network, so I thought this might be a fun movie to try. Overall, it was fun watch. Different from your typical Korean drama type films. The story is pretty straight forward competition between two life long rivals. Cool to see some interesting ways to prepare food, some funny moments, and the lead actress is pretty too.",1346112000,,401,4.661971830985915
3513775,5,B001CK4FJY,"I'm not a ""kinoman"" but I love Gourmet Cuisine from all around the World and that's why I picked up this movie.
And I loved all the culinary aspects of this film. All of all dishes and their presentations are mouth watering, and cooking/knife techniques are exactly the same like my Korean friends use. Even the side stories like charcoal making or poisoning fish are interesting. The story by itself is also nice.
The movie made me to dream to become young again and go to culinary school.",1345507200,10,490,4.579545454545454

3513791,3,B001CK4FJY,I have never seen a Korean movie...there are some things in this movie that I assume satisfy the cultural expectations of its intended audience. The story telling is a little odd and somewhat confusing.,1410307200,,202,4.970588235294118
3513792,5,B001CK4FJY,"This came to our house within record timing, it was wonderfully presented to us in a hard slip cover. Interestingly enough it came with a coupon for a chinese pizza hut, what cute surprise. The disc was in mint condition, and the picture was stunning...the story is dipped with so much emotion it had us tearing up quite a few times...the food was mouthwatering and with the movies end i was left wanting more, a perfect foodie movie for those with an appetite for some authentic korean dishes along with a story or two.

3513793,3,B001CK4FJY,"The story goes back to two disciples' masters/grandfathers' feuds.  At times plot was not clearly delivered but overall kind of fun to watch.  Be warned that there are parts where cutting meat, slaughter animals scenes can be offensive to some people.  I get it's part of the culture, but rather retarded to think that cooking contest has a major part about how to butcher a cow.",1409616000,,379,4.712121212121212

3513796,4,B001CK4FJY,"This movie is based on the comic written and illustrated by Huh Young-man with the name ""Sikgaek"".  It was serialized with 135 of gently touching stories in newspaper the Dong-a in 2002. The original ""Sikgaek"" is all about respect the value of food. The plot of this movie is a little bit too dramatic and exaggerated but still very impressive considering the running time. If you are a chef or a person who knows how to respect food, you would enjoy this movie.",1408320000,,462,4.566265060240964

3513804,5,B001CK4FJY,"My husband and I really enjoyed this movie even though the plot was somewhat predictable the main character was nuanced. The hidden gem was a short story within the story of Han the charcoal maker. I don't want to ruin it for anyone, but it is haunting and will stay with me longer than the main story. Very glad we watched this.",1402099200,2,329,4.32258064516129
3513805,4,B001CK4FJY,"By far the best K-flick I've seen to date. Interesting storyline (descendent of a Japanese invader returns a national treasure with apologies to the Korean people? WTF? Hell freeze over?), a bit of intrigue, lots of family love (and hate), and light-hearted moments counter-balance the ""been there, done that"" elements of the movie.

What I really loved was its masterful technique of story within the story that draws in tragedy (Shakespearean in scope where the coal maker is concerned) without diffusing or mucking up any of the movie's comedic flare or the overarching ""The Little Engine That Could"" theme of the story.",1401062400,,623,5.107843137254902
3513806,4,B001CK4FJY,"I first stumbled onto this story by watching the Korean Drama<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gourmet-Trencherman-Best-Chef-Korean-Drama-with-English-Subtitle/dp/B0077EGC4A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gourmet / Trencherman / Best Chef (Korean Drama) with English Subtitle</a>and to be completely honest, it is much more satisfying on many levels: better character development, more actual ""cooking,"" and a lot more warmth and humor. That said, there's also a lot about this film to praise: gorgeous cinematography, a more sinister rivalry, a few genuinely touching moments, and a better leading man. I also loved the mystery and conspiracy elements, as well as the more in-depth treatment of a very painful time in Korean history that I know practically nothing about. The main strike against this movie is the pace is rushed, and it's far too short.

Of course, any one who loves food will appreciate the glorifying spectacle and pageantry here as well. Maybe consider eating before watching because I think it will make most people hungry.

3513807,3,B001CK4FJY,"Great plot, but original Grand Chef actors were perfect and believable in parts played. These actors were too young for the level they were supposed to be at and the plot was so similar to the Grand Chef it was like a copy or remake of it but done at a much lower level. Not enough actual cooking though harder to show in a single movie format as the original was a series. But still enjoyable movie to watch. One disturbing trend that is portrayed in all K Dramas is the seemingly widespread unethical and immoral behaviors of Korean upper society. Even the middle and lower classes seem to suffer from widespread envy and covet all things material that the upper classes have. Either these K Dramas are just fiction or Korean society as a whole has degraded into an immoral, characterless people lacking in integrity and morals. I hope this is not so but when every new K Drama portrays people like this, the financial success of Korea has corrupted the people with wonton covetitiousness.",1399852800,,991,4.636363636363637

3513809,5,B001CK4FJY,"It is a great movie, the food looks absolutely beautiful and delicious. I recommend you watch this if you loves kdramas since this movie is played out in a similar kdrama fashion. But yes. Watch it! :)",1393804800,,201,4.45945945945946
3513810,5,B001CK4FJY,"This was a totally unexpected delight. I rarely write a review. As far as I remember, this is my second review on Amazon. After watching it, something in my heart urged me to write anything about it. It was not easy to choose it over many Prime Amazon Instant Videos because I have never heard of it. However, it turns out that I found a great movie. I felt like I discovered a hidden treasure.

I cannot forget the scene that the protagonist's cow slowly walks on the isle to be butchered. It seemed that the cow knew what he was doing. He was dying for his beloved owner. However, I really wished the main actor did not let his cow be killed for his culinary competition....I think I will be sad whenever the scene pops up in my mind for the time being. It was so sad.",1393200000,,770,4.202702702702703
3513811,5,B001CK4FJY,"I loved this movie. It  has all the great food reminiscent of movies like Eat, Drink, Man, Woman and Big Night Out. If you love to watch movies with food, you must see this!",1390089600,,173,4.088235294117647
3513812,4,B001CK4FJY,"If you are a foodie and enjoy Korean culture, you will like this movie. In a way, you could describe it as a Korean interpretation of the Iron Chef competition but with family history between the combatants. Can be a little predictable at times but the purity of the plot should not be underestimated.",1388793600,,301,4.592592592592593
3513813,4,B001CK4FJY,"Decent Movie, but if you've watched the K-Drama ""Gourmet"" then you've seen this movie.  For a 2-hour watch you get all the main story points.  I preferred the Bad Brother in ""Gourmet"" rather than the bad guy in this movie....he was just TOO BAD and was not a redeemable character.",1384387200,,280,4.58

3513818,2,B001CK4FJY,"Not bad enough to be good just bad.

Since I paid to watch it I watched it to the end. Doubt if I will watch another Korean flick ever again.

Korean script writers must come from the same school that trains Korean pilots.",1374710400,,222,4.1395348837209305
3513819,4,B001CK4FJY,"This movie gives interesting insight into Korean cuisine and culture. The plot is fairly predictable but it was fun to watch nevertheless. The way the food is presented and described gives you an appreciation for the art of cooking. They really take pride in the entire process from growing the food to raising their animals to bringing it to the table, something that has gotten lost in Western culture.",1374278400,6,404,4.869565217391305
3513820,5,B001CK4FJY,"Not the best movie i have ever seen but entertaining and worth the watch to me.  Nothing to complain about it.  I'm used to watching 16-100 hour Korean drama's (Kdrama) so it did seem a bit compressed.. only 2 hours long to develop characters and story line etc.. but it was good.  careful tho.. extreme caution.. you get exposure to korean works, and get past the burden of reading subtitles.. you can get SEVERELY addicted to kdrama/movies, like i have.  I suspect that there is limited time for americans to discover and view what's coming out of korea.. till the people making money on these things realize they are way undervalued.",1373932800,3,636,4.702702702702703

3513822,5,B001CK4FJY,"As a chef myself this is my favorite movie. It really shows how important food is to people and to those who make it. Every time I watch this movie, Which has been many, It sends me right to the kitchen to cook. It also shows even the most humble of foods has an importance in peoples hearts. This is by far the best movie to describe the heart of  chef who truly loves food",1369180800,5,374,3.986666666666667
3513823,4,B001CK4FJY,"The movie was decently watchable, however, between the main story and the interjecting subplots I felt the movie wasn't balanced.  Would have like to had more character development of the main guy and the grandfather etc.  Did not really feel that the food was featured well.",1366848000,,275,4.956521739130435
3513824,5,B001CK4FJY,I loved how the main character stayed true to himself and didn't give up. He showed great care with food.,1366675200,,105,4.3
3513825,3,B001CK4FJY,"While this movie had its points, I've got to say that I enjoyed the TV adaptation of this story (English title: ""Gourmet"") much, much more. The acting in the TV Drama was, in my opinion, much better on pretty much every level. The characters were much more interestingly developed as you would expect when you've got so much more time to delve into things than with a feature-length piece.

In spite of that, I did enjoy the movie. There were some great, over-the-top'ish moments of comic relief as I've come to expect from most S. Korean productions, but it wasn't nearly as over-blown or out of proportion as some instances I've seen. I found myself gritting my teeth a bit at some of the less-well played bits of melodrama, but that's also something I've come to expect from Korean movies of a certain vintage.

Not the greatest example of S. Korean cinema, but certainly not the worst.

And if you thought the movie was okay, I very strongly recommend you watch the TV series.

I haven't been able to get my hands on the manhwa (graphic novel) on which this movie and that TV show were based, but I've got it on my list.",1356566400,,1124,4.495098039215686

8287981,4,B001CK4FJY,"This movie shows cooking not only as an art form, but as a potential means to capture the cultural essence of a people. For a Westerner like me, aspects of the storyline and some of its details are beyond my full comprehension. They border on the mystical. Still, this film was well acted, with a nice balance between funny and loving scenes as well as scenes provoking sadness and even anger. 4 1/2 stars",1476489600,,405,4.486486486486487
