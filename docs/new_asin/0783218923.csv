45831,4,0783218923,"I wanted this film because I am a huge fan of I Dream of Jeannie and I wanted to see the film that inspired the series.  However, be warned that the DVD may not play in All DVD players...  When I tried to watch it the first time it would not play and I just assumed it was corrupted.  Then I read on the cover that it may only play in DVD Players and may not work in some DVD Recorders or Computer DVD drives, which was the case with my current DVD Recorder...  After reading the warning, I decided to try it in my old GO Video DVD Recorder and it worked just fine... I did not try it my computer drive though...  The film itself was very interesting and well done...",1266105600,14,667,3.9849624060150375
45832,5,0783218923,"Barbara Eden Best Known for her role of Jeannie the genie starred in this movie about a genie before she played Jeannie the genie though she didn't play the genie in this movie. Barbara Eden played the role of ""Sylvia Kenton"" the girlfriend of Tony Randall's character Harold in this movie. Tony Randall starred in the role of ""Harold Ventimore"" who becomes the master of a 3,000 year old genie played by Burl Ives.
Tony Randall's character ""Harold"" is engaged to marry ""Sylvia"" though her parents (played by Ann Doran and Edward Andrews) are somewhat worried about her marrying Harold especially when Harold claims there is a genie. One of the best scenes in the movie is where Barbara Eden in the role of ""Sylvia Kenton"" says ""And I suppose she's a genie to""
and Tony Randall's ""Harold Ventimore"" says ""Yes she is"".The movie is in color and a favorite movie of the 1960's with Barbara Eden before she became Famous for her role of the genie Jeannie. The movie inspired Sidney Sheldon to produce the Jeannie show a year later after this movie.",1264982400,6,1044,4.679347826086956
45833,5,0783218923,"This isn't a review but this is a film that I've wanted on DVD and I'm trying to determine if this archive release is in its OAR 1.85:1 (according to IMDB).  I haven't seen any online reviews as yet but if the Universal archive titles are similar to the Warner archive titles, I'm guessing that this one is OAR.  Has anyone bought this yet from Amazon?  I noticed that Amazon didn't list the format (OAR, 1.33:1, etc) in their product information.

[edit] According to a member over on the Home Theater Forum, this release is in its OAR and is anamorphic.  Yes! :)  The HTF member rates this film transfer as very good with little film dirt/noise present.

As for the movie, I rate it a five-star film.  It's a typical 60's (1964) comedy film with Barbara Eden in a ""non-genie"" role but this film actually inspired the hit TV series ""I Dream Of Jeannie"".

It has a strong supporting cast with Edward Andrews, Richard Erdman, Kathie Browne, Parley Baer.  And, Burl Ives as the genie with Tony Randall as the reluctant owner of the bottle.

I highly recommend this film for an early 60's family comedy treat.",1263686400,16,1106,4.5353535353535355

45835,5,0783218923,"Burl Ives is a riot in this film.  It's funny, hilarious and full of camp.  It's a great laugh and reminds us all of a gentler time.  Burl Ives as Fakrash ala Mash, a Genie of the Green Gin, gets Tony Randall into so much trouble you just can't stop laughing.  It's great to which him turn the father in law into a mule (Since thou art stubborn as a mule, thou shalt become one,) with a flick of the hand.  In the end, you can see the moral of the story and it's really a great light hearted film.",1177977600,5,497,3.93

45837,5,0783218923,"As Bewitched, and other excellent TV shows from the 60s get remade, it's about time people start to look at what was the genesis of these great shows.
First and foremost, you can sit down and enjoy the show. Randall, Ives, and the young Eden, all team up to produce some great moments. The court room scenes being some great fare.
As basic as the FX  are, they are subtle, and work well.
I recall watching this movie many times on afternoon movie matinees on TV, and it was always one to watch and enjoy, just as some of the Ray Harryhausen works were always ones to sneak up in the middle of the night, and watch with the volume low.

Hopefully the studios will see these great films as candidates for full restoration, either THX, or taking the audio from basic stereo to good surround sound ( augment if they must), but at least give us these great films with as many extras as possible; and most definitely  in the original aspect ratio.",1117065600,30,941,4.396551724137931
45838,5,0783218923,"Before Barbara Eden played a Genie on the home screen, she played the fiance of a man (Tony Randall) who had a Genie. This film is a lot of fun to watch.  The Genie (played by Burl Ives) tries everything to please his master, but to no avail. All of his good works turn into problems.  This is a light-hearted comedy which should be reproduced for public viewing. We all need a laugh now and then (especially now!).  And this film will fill the bill.

45864,5,0783218923,"I never had a chance to see the play and would like to some day. In the mean time I have a DVD copy of the movie with Tony Randall, Barbara Eden, and Burl Ives (1964, Harry Keller). I would like the other movie versions also.

The story is simple but becomes complex. Mild mannered obscure architect Horace Ventimore (Tony Randall) is in love with Sylvia Kenton (Barbara Eden, I Dream of Jeannie). In an attempt to impress his potential father-in-law Professor Kenton (Edward Andrews), Horace purchases a KumKum (ancient brass bottle.) Upon opening it, you guess it a djinn, Fakrash (Burl Ives), pops out; in his gratitude Fakrash helps Ventimore in a way you would not believe; neither did Ventimore.

The story was slightly modified from the book but the modifications add to the plot. It is as if the actors were born for the parts they play. Burl Ives makes a believable Fakrash; you would think F. Anstey had him in mind when he wrote the novel in 1900.",1501113600,2,958,4.5964912280701755

When my first order arrived and I tried to watch it, I couldn't get anything on my computer.  So I returned it for another one thinking that the first one was defective.  When the replacement arrived it was the same story.  So I kept it and had my son try it on his TV which plays Blu-ray and it wasn't until we had to pause the movie that we discovered it's a Blu-ray disc and not a DVD.

Burl Ives plays genie and Tony Randall the man who sets him free and becomes his master.  The genie tries to help him with everything and just makes a bigger mess out of everything.

45929,5,0783218923,"This movie is a MUST HAVE for those who like clean entertainment with great acting by a stellar cast and excellent delivery on a smooth, fast flow of hysterical situations which would clearly make you think of this as a precursor to ""I Dream of Jeannie"" which carries Barbara Eden into stardom.  I found my DVD working in perfect condition and understand others complaints, but this is something that will make you feel REAL GOOD every time you watch it... from beginning to end!

Tony Randall is the ""average guy"" doing his best to make a good living, preparing to marry (with Barbara Eden) and meet her parents who are NOT very keen on Tony Randall's history as a former beatnik, but who cleaned up very nicely.  He is doing his best to charm them and acquires a brass bottle which he hopes to give as a gift to them since his potential father-in-law-to-be is very interested in other cultures and quite learned.  Let's just say the brass bottle ends up with Tony Randall who unseals it and release a genie (Burl Ives) who is so grateful to be released he insists on trying to make Tony Randall's life better, but consistently creates ever great havoc while you laugh at every turn.

NOTE:  At the time of posting this, I noticed Amazon had their info wrong about the year of this film as they show 1969, but it's really 1964.  How else could Barbara Eden become the star of a 1965 sitcom if she made the movie after the show began?  Probably just a typo... NO biggie.  This is a movie for all ages without a doubt and a definite ""G"" rating, but incredibly full of twists and turns to make it worth adding to your collection of ""Feel Good"" movies.  Enjoy!!!",1386892800,3,1659,4.4635761589403975

45932,5,0783218923,A tale of best intentions gone so terribly wrong that you wonder how everything can be set right again -- but the happy ending is as unexpected as it is satisfying. And the moral -- honesty not magic creates miracles -- is most refreshing. Tony Randall and Barbara Eden put in scintillating performances.

Burl Ives defied my expectations by being a crafty, incorrigible genie, talking like he was being helpful but acting by his own agenda; this became funnier to me over the course of the movie.

I remembered it as very clever and in a genre with Breakfast at Tiffany's, Barefoot in the Park, The Apartment.... as a 60s era cool comedy film.  Unfortunately, as with many of these memories from childhood, what was great at 9 years old is just OK now.  I love Burl Ives of course, and while the special effects were exciting for the time (like Mary Poppins when Uncle Albert flies around the room), now it's just kind of nostalgic.
