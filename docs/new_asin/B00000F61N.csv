1207446,5,B00000F61N,"When the first season of Flipper aired, I was 10.  Over 40 years later, this is an exceptional set to own.  The quality is superb.  It could very easily air today as a brand new TV show and nobody would know the difference because the production stands up to anything today.  The characters are all great role models.  I remember going to the Miami Seaquarium as a teen just to walk back to the movie set where they filmed many of the outdoor sequences to this TV series.

I actually applauded after watching the first episode.  This is a ""must own"" for anyone who is starved for a good quality television series.  If you like boats and the water...you'll REALLY like this series!  Do yourself a favor and the next time you think you need to buy a Disney film for a child or grandchild...buy this instead.

Being a native of Florida, my brothers and I grew up with this show. We were the same age as Sandy and Bud when it was on originally. It has action, adventure, and it's more realistic than the tv shows kids usually watch today. This show is not dumbed down at all.

1207671,4,B00000F61N,"There are two ways to review a DVD video ... you can review the program for the usual things like acting, plot, wardrobe, music, etc. Or you can review the DVD as a product, in the same manner as you would review any product, looking at the quality and value of the product. With videos you would focus on how good the image looks on your screen, how clear the sound is, how good the disc pressing is, does the packaging contain the information you need, etc.

I generally prefer the latter method of reviewing DVD videos. To review the content is 100% subjective and something no one has any control over - the program has already been filmed and released, a positive or negative review can't change it.

I will mention my overall impression of Flipper as a TV show (although I count these impressions in my final rating). I had never seen it before and it is definitely a throwback to an earlier lifestyle, a lot like Mayberry RFD. For being as old as it is, it doesn't come off as hopelessly dated, maybe because the action mostly centers on or near the water and boats and that sort of thing hasn't changed that much. The show is surprisingly high-budget for a TV show of its type, with lots of underwater footage, boats and even helicopters. Sitcoms today tend to never leave one fixed set. Maybe the acting isn't great but honestly I prefer it to some of the current sitcoms in which characters read unnaturally long pieces of dialogue trying to milk a punch line that isn't funny while a laugh track plays in the background.

So, moving on to the product itself. The DVD case contains two smaller slip cases, each of which contains two double-sided discs for a total of four discs and eight sides, representing the entire first season of Flipper sans commercials. The packaging is colorful and protects the product well. The discs have no label because they are two-sided. It isn't hard to figure out that the sub-case marked 1-2 has the first two discs and the one of the left is logically the beginning. The only way to know for sure is to insert the disc into your player and view the title page. Hint: the ""A"" side of each disc has a blue inner ring, while the ""B"" side has a silver ring.

The video quality is amazing. Considering the quality of even the highest priced professional video monitors available back in 1963 it's a safe bet that no one in those days ever saw these shows in the amazing quality we are able to see them today on an ordinary LCD TV. There is no grain, no shakiness, no scratches - the colors are rich and saturated and as detailed as a Blu-Ray. The sound quality is superb as well, especially considering the challenges of how these shows were filmed.

My rating of 4-stars is based on just a slight ding for the lack of labeling and that each disc contains the full warnings about copying discs and other similar stuff. I believe if someone is buying a set, it is only necessary to provide those warnings at the beginning of the first disc, not on every disc.",1404604800,3,2999,4.455373406193078
1207672,5,B00000F61N,"Loved the show as a kid, and it's just as good today as an adult. Well done asa DVD with great color and sound as well.",1404518400,,119,3.6153846153846154

1207674,5,B00000F61N,"This DVD set is a monument to a golden age of American television. In a modern world obsessed with violence, sex and with Hollywood now so determined to portray families riddled with problems and with pampered children closeted by politically correct modern themes, Flipper represents a dose of old fashioned values from an era now sadly largely gone. There is no cussing, sexual content or anxiety ridden acting out by children. Porter Ricks comes across as an earnest and conscientious father raising two rambunctious and inquisitive boys all the while keeping various crooks at bay at the Coral Keys Park and protecting and rescuing all manner of visitors to the southern Florida paradise.

The quality of the footage is superb - from the rich color (done in an era when color filming was not yet the norm), excellent clarity and of course the underwater footage which is as good as any you'll see in modern TV or films today. The plot lines are somewhat predictable, even a little corny but a number of episodes feature some excellent even gripping story lines. Yes - Flipper is invested with almost human powers and the dolphin footage gets spliced with lots of re-runs of similar Flipper scenes, but the result is one that carries on the endearing fondness between animal and human that was so richly on display between Luke Halpin and the various dolphins who starred as Flipper in the original two movies. It is interesting to note the insertion of an older pilot of the TV show as episode 3 of Series 1 that was clearly filmed right after the second movie in 1963 when Halpin was only 16 as he clearly had begun maturing more when all the other episodes of Season 1 were filmed a year later in 1964 and screened that fall. It provides a neat transition from the 2nd movie and enabled the studio to experiment with the mix of Tommy Norden as Bud with Kelly and Halpin.

The family chemistry is most endearing and enjoyable. The boys seem to live an idyllic carefree life mostly in the water where a vast playground of sand, sea, boats and diving is a stone's throw away. The ease in which Sandy and Bud jump into and pilot any available boat and throw on scuba tanks and roam the sea floor is one of the many attractions of the series - indeed Halpin became such an accomplished diver that once his post-Flipper career floundered after the advantage of his late maturation (giving NBC the ability to play an older teen in a mid-teen role) was negated by his eventual adulthood and thus growing out of the Sandy Ricks role, Halpin became a sought after diving consultant to the Florida movie industry for many decades. It's hard to find an actor after all these years who combined a depth of excellent acting talent with down home telegenic good looks AND superb athleticism. It's no wonder Halpin became a popular teen idol to the young teenage girl readers of teen magazines with his mop of blond hair, boyish innocence and lots of scenes featuring his tanned shirtless athletic torso.

The Flipper TV shows make for excellent television even 50 years later with new generations of children able to enjoy the fruits of Ricou Browning's excellent direction work. He features a number of famous older actors and some who went on to became household names (Martin Sheen, Burt Reynolds, and Barbara Feldman) in small cameo roles. By filming exclusively in Florida away from the glitz and glamor of Hollywood, it gives the show a sense of believable reality. In our jaded cynical world where children have to grow up too fast (and TV shows are hastening that process), it's great to watch a TV program that shows boys just being simple boys and a father requiring discipline, hard work, responsibility and consequences all against the backdrop of one of nature's most compelling animals playing a pivotal role in all episodes and all filmed in one of America's prettiest locations. There is so much to like about Flipper and I'm so glad that it has been released on such quality DVDs for new generations to enjoy.",1392940800,3,4017,4.719373219373219
1207675,5,B00000F61N,What a great show this was and is. I remember as a kid loving this show. Everyone wanted a pet dolphin and to go swimming every day. What a life. A nice DVD set to buy if you have kids too,1391817600,,188,3.6097560975609757
1207676,4,B00000F61N,"I bought this because I remember LOVING the show as a kid.  I watched it before school every morning.  My children are 4 and 6.  We sat down to watch the first episode (man gets bitten by a shark and the family & flipper are going to save the day).  They were both really upset and scared (even though the shark really didn't even get seen).  The 4yr old was begging me to turn it off and the 6yr old with watery eyes said ""why do they have to make it so scary?"". So...that was a bust.  Luckly we had also bought the Brady Bunch first season.  So they still got a ""treat"" and we put on the first episode of that which went over much better for this age.

I am very impressed with the high quality of cinematography and acting and unlike any Black and White television shows, having Flipper in color seems very important to my young children.

They love this show as much or more than I probably did back then. When I finally got these DVDs, they couldn't wait to see the same episodes they saw on Hulu. My wife, who was born years after this show aired, has also been surprised at how interesting and enjoyable Flipper is.

Flipper, Brady Bunch, Partridge Family and Lost in Space have all been winners with my little ones. Out of these shows, Flipper is probably the best. This was an unexpected surprise and a good one.",1383264000,,817,4.551020408163265

1207703,5,B00000F61N,"How can you overrate Flipper? You can't. This series is as excellent to watch today as when it was new. The Ricks family being a father and his two sons seems more normal now than it did back in 1964. The decision to not have a mother in the series caused some comment back then but was largely due to budget. Still the family shown is warm and affectionate and Porter Ricks is an involved father who clearly cares for his sons. The boys are well-played by Luke Halpin (Sandy) and Tommy Norden (Bud). Bud was a new character, one of the many changes from the original Flipper movie. The studio aimed the show at a younger audience and felt they needed someone younger than Sandy for them to follow. It worked, as it brought a kid's perspective into the mix and set up many of the situations. Flipper himself is the biggest change in the series. In the movie he was just a trained dolphin who cau rings with his snout. In the series, Flipper is possessed of amazing abilities to communicate, perform very complex actions, and even to know bad guys from good before the human characters do. In the movie he was a pet but in the show he's almost a guardian angel.

Then there's the photography, above and under the water. The show's transfers here are absolutely excellent, so clear and bright they look like they were filmed last month. There is also the show's trademark underwater photography that is wonderful to see and is always accompanied by a beautifully Impressionistic score. It was not usual to use color for a half hour show aimed at youth back in the early sixties, but it was a really wise decision as a black-and white Flipper would have made it so much less than it is now. The plots are a pleasing mix of comedy, drama and action with Flipper or Porter usually coming to the rescue. What other TV dad could jump into the ocean fully clothed and beat up the villain?

A great value for the price with the full '64-'65 season of over thirty episodes. Great nostalgia for someone like me, but also I'd recommend it for anyone with kids.",1378598400,3,2048,4.458666666666667

I grew up on the Texas Gulf Coast but it didn't compare to the beautiful clear blue water of the fictional Florida marine preserve where Flipper lived. The underwater scenes were spectacular to this 8 year old girl.

Flipper was the loyal friend of Chief Warden, Porter Ricks, and his sons Sandy and Bud. Flipper was always around to help Porter solve crimes and figure out strange mysteries and to keep Sandy and Bud safe and entertained.

Unlike so called family shows these days, Flipper is a refreshing look back to a time when foul language and suggestive situations didn't spoil evening TV time.

1207733,5,B00000F61N,"Anyone who grew up in the 60's, 70's or 80's remembers watching this on television.  I remember my family watching this every day on the CBN.  This is just a wholesome show with no cussing or sex and plenty of mischif!  While Bud, the younger of the two Ricks children gets him and Flipper into all kinds of trouble; the older brother, Sandy usually finds himself right in the middle of it as well due to Bud's pleadings.  Many times, Porter Ricks is right there with them - but since he's the dad, he usually does the punishing.

What ever happened to the days when an entertaining dolphin, two mischevious boys who practically live with the fish, and an old-fashioned widowed father who still believes spanking his kids can get a point across will fill our entertainment needs?

Though season two is available, it is a lot more expensive then the first season.  Season three isn't available at all.  Every few months I check back to see if we'll be in luck to get these last to seasons at a reasonable price, but so far no go...

Though this show is based on the movie with Chuck Connors, there are a lot of differences.  Porter Ricks lives in a different house and closer to the ocean.  Though the bird and Flipper are still in existence, the mother is not.  Sandy now has a brother.  Even Porter Ricks has undergone a personality change.  The father is more loving.  Though he may be as stern, he seems to be stern in a different type of way.

1207737,1,B00000F61N,"While I enjoy watching the antics of the bottlenose dolphin and the Porter Ricks family, I am very bothered by the theme song.

How can ""everyone"" love Flipper?  You only get (at best) a passing acquaintance from watching the animal on television.  To really get to ""love"" Flipper the seven billion inhabitants of the planet would have to travel to Miami for several weeks each, exhausting the world's economy.

Flipper is not the ""King of the Sea"".  The King of the Sea is Poseidon.  The part of Flipper was played by two dolphins named Mitzi & Kathy, so if anything Flipper would be the Queen, Princess, or something like that.

Flipper is not ""smarter"" than anyone you'd see.  These animals have been extensively studied and though they can be trained to do backflips and kill people, their intelligence is actually measured slightly below the average Belgian.

Flipper is not ""faster than lightning"".  The fastest a bottlenose dolphin can swim is 30 mph.  Lightning typically travels at 140,000 mph - if Flipper was this fast the dolphin would accelerate out of the atmosphere and instantly die of asphyxiation, dehydration and hypothermia.  In the vacuum of space its bodily fluids would boil, and the animal would probably disintegrate from explosive decompression.  That might be an entertaining spectacle but would be impractical in a continuing serial episodic television format.

Flipper does not live in a ""world full of wonder"".  In a typical episode Flipper is trapped in a fishing net, attacked by sharks, or threatened by a group of organized criminals.  Hardly a utopian realm of ""wonder""; rather it is actually a very unnatural, hostile environment for such a creature.

Furthermore, Flipper does not live ""under the sea"".  These dolphins live IN the sea and suck through their blowholes at the surface.  Therefore Flipper occupies the pelagic zone, whereas ""under the sea"" would refer to creatures residing underneath the benthic boundary layer of subsea soils, where fauna consists mainly of bacteria and microalgae.  As an air-breathing mammal, Flipper would not live ""under the sea"" for long.

If you think about it, Flipper probably suffers from some sort of neurosis, which causes it to hang around Butch & Sandy instead of joining a pod, participating in cooperative hunting behavior, and mating.  In frustration, the dolphin flings its body out of the water, performing tail-stand displays and plaintively crying out in pain, which the humans misinterpret as play.  They point at the suffering animal and laugh.

The humane thing would be to euthanize Flipper and get Butch & Sandy a couple of jet skis to occupy their time.

In future releases a more accurate theme song should be used, which would make the DVD more enjoyable for me.

Hope this helps!",1343952000,11,2778,5.037280701754386
1207738,4,B00000F61N,"Following up the success of their films&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flipper/dp/B00029LOAO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flipper</a>&nbsp;(1963) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flipper-s-New-Adventure/dp/B000BPL2G0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flipper's New Adventure</a>&nbsp;(1964), MGM studios and producer Ivan Tors (Daktari, Gentle Ben) reworked the basic premise of the movies, and adapted it for television.  The TV series Flipper (1964-67), featured three key characters from the movie, Porter Ricks a warden at Coral Key Park in Florida, his teenaged son Sandy, and Flipper, the family's beloved pet bottlenosed dolphin.  For the series, Ricks was given a second son Bud, who is younger than Sandy.

The result is a fun, family friendly program that features a super-intelligent dolphin that comes to the rescue of his human friends.  The show's likeable cast features Brian Kelly (1931-2005) as Porter Ricks, Luke Halpin as Sandy, and freckled Tommy Norden as the youngster Bud.  The handsome and athletic Kelly, makes a strong father figure, although he seems a little too youthful to have a son Sandy's age.  Kelly assumed the role of Ricks in the second film, while Luke Halpin starred in both movies as the likeable and level-headed Sandy.  Tommy Norden overacts at times, but that's mostly a deliberate choice by the producers, who make Bud more involved with Flipper than Sandy, and the one who usually gets into trouble.

The show features ample action on the water, and undersea as well.  Incorporating an animal into a television program is normally a challenge, and working with a dolphin presents a unique set of problems.  Although guided by skilled trainers, it's not unexpected that at times Flipper's performance may not be exactly what is required.  You have to make allowances for the practical limitations of a series set in the ocean, but often shot at the Miami Seaquarium, a marine park.  Stock footage is often used, and some of the scenes do not match the situations, such as when the ocean floor is seen in deep water situations.  Flipper's size varies a bit, as he was actually played by several different dolphins.  Those kind of things are understandable, and don't seriously detract from the enjoyment of the stories.

A few familiar names appear on the program, but Florida being far from Hollywood, many in the cast are people you may not normally see.  As the stories involve boating, swimming, or diving, a certain level of physical fitness and familiarity with the water is typically required.  These factors, contribute to the program having a slightly different look.  Among the guest stars just starting their careers are Lynda Day (Mission Impossible) , Jessica Walter (Play Misty For Me, Archer), and Barbara Feldon (Get Smart).  Others appearing include Wende Wagner (The Green Hornet), James Best, Diana van der Vlis, and the stars of Ivan Tors' next TV series Daktari (1966-69), Marshall Thompson and Cheryl Miller.

Like many programs, the writing improves as the season progresses.  Among the better episodes are ""Dolphin For Sale"", where an unscrupulous opportunist attempts to sell Flipper to a circus.  In ""Second Time Around"", a wheelchair bound former water skiing champion has given up hope, until she meets Flipper.  Flipper becomes a father, in ""Flipper and the White Dolphin"", and Marshall Thompson guests as an expert looking to develop a shark repellent formula ,in ""The Day of the Shark"".  Thompson also directs four episodes.

Seven year old Denise Nickerson (Dark Shadows, The Electric Company) makes an impressive TV debut, as a runaway child, in ""Bud Minds Baby"".  Bud comes to the rescue in ""Sailor Bud"", following directions on the radio, he has to sail a small boat to safety, after the owner is bitten by a deadly sea snake.

In the three part adventure, ""Flipper and the Elephant"", the Ricks family comes to the rescue, saving Bonnie McCoy (Cheryl Miller), her father Sean (Pat Hennings), a chimpanzee named Judy, and an elephant named Esme, when the McCoy's boat sinks.  Things get complicated when a creditor seeks to take away the elephant as payment, and Sean McCoy ends up in jail.  In a program that lacks a regular feminine presence, Cheryl Miller is like a ray of sunshine.

The season finishes with Flipper facing great danger, as a film crew with a temperamental director, comes to Coral Key to shoot a movie featuring an undersea monster terrorizing a beautiful girl (Wende Wagner).  Flipper is very taken with the young actress, and mistaking the monster's attack for the real thing, puts himself in the line of fire.

A throwback to a much simpler time, Flipper is a light, fun, and engaging program featuring a single father trying to teach his sons the right way to live.  Flipper the pet dolphin makes the show unique, but family values and examining how different characters handle moral dilemmas, is an integral part of the series.  Showing simple life lessons, it's mostly lightweight material with a low level of violence that is generally safe for young children.  The image quality of the color episodes is quite good, and they are subtitled.  Guest stars Marshall Thompson, Cheryl Miller, and Judy the chip, would soon appear in Ivan Tors' feature film, Clarence the Cross-Eyed Lion (1965), the forerunner of the series Daktari.",1343347200,,5413,5.312206572769953

  Yes, we all love Flipper, the dolphin, but the storyline (even for the young) isn't well written and extremely boring and predictable. It's hard now to look back on this series as anything but a long drawn out boring series that probably could have been made into a 3 part mini-series.

1207795,5,B00000F61N,"This has been a real pleasure to watch.  I am almost fifty now and ""Flipper"" was one of those shows in syndication that I pretty much passed up as many of my friends have said.  But in a time when today's television is so bad I've been turning to 1960s television for entertainment.  So I decided to shell out the bucks and buy season one of ""Flipper.""  Well, it was definitely one of the smartest things I've ever done.

Season One of ""Flipper"" is in glorious color, at a time when most prime time TV shows in 1964 were still very much in black and white. And the prints of each episode are in superb condition, especially when watched on a eighty foot television screen.

What I like most about this show besides everyone's favorite dolphin is the bond Porter Ricks has with his two sons Sandy and Bud.  The boys are being raised without a mother but dad is doing just fine.  It's all fiction, of course, but I like the warm feeling that I get from each show.

There is one small problem, though. Disc Four from my set is a duplicate of Disc Three even though the disc itself is designated as Disc Four.  I am calling customer service in the morning to try and get it replaced.  Someone else here in the reviews brought the same problem up.  There must have been hundreds of sets sold with the same error.

I would definitely recommend this if you're thinking of buying ""Flipper"" season one.",1274572800,9,1393,4.373540856031128
1207796,5,B00000F61N,"I was looking up the 90's remake of Flipper on amazon.com and when the results came up I spotted Flipper Season One.  (I never knew there was a television show) So I asked my mom if she had ever seen it. She said it was a really good show and since my favorite animals are dolphins I decided to buy it and boy am I glad I did.

When I got it in the mail I was really exited but I didn't really enjoy the first episode. But after a few more episodes I really started to enjoy the show and now it's one of my favorite shows I own.  It took me some time before I got used to all the characters but when I did the show was a lot of fun to watch. Now the acting isn't amazing but it's not bad either. Porter Ricks (Brian Kelly) is a widowed father and the Chief Warden of Coral Key Park. (Porter Ricks is in my opinion corny but I like him any ways.) Sandy Ricks (Luke Halpin) is Porter Rick's oldest son and helps his dad at Coral Key Park. Bud Ricks (Tommy Norden) is the youngest and his favorite companion is Flipper.

There's hardly any grainy footage and the episodes are not edited, so it's definitely worth buying. Unfortunately there are no bonus features... oh yeah there's a trivia game hooray... But seriously, when are we going to get some real bonus features for these sets. At least some interviews or a documentary...sigh...One last annoying this is that the DVD's are double sided which makes them easier to get scratched.

I remember thinking it would be so cool to have my own dolphin and I thought Flipper was so smart, but I had pretty much forgotten the rest.  Surprisingly, even though this appeals to children, it is really adult orientated; the themes are adult (ie., a man has been poisoned by a dangerous fish and is laying dying in his submarine; will the ranger find him in time to save him?).

This is also a refreshing video to share with children.  The boys in this video are respectful to the father and obedient to adults.

However, what I didn't expect was some of the serious issues this series dealt with on an episode-by-episode basis.  What happens when people you trust turn out to be evil?  What happens when your dad starts dating a strange woman after your mother has passed away?  In the background, behind the antics of the legendary and lovable dolphin, the writers dealt with many of the tragic things that happen in life, and they tried to give a postive message with each story.

Also, watch those guest stars!  Some were soon to be famous, like Barbara Feldon, and some were already very accomplished and toward the end of their careers, like Margaret Hayes.  You'll see John Abbott -- famous to Star Trek fans as the leading elder in ""Errand of Mercy"" -- and others like the beautiful Lynda Day George and the gorgeous Jessica Walter at the beginning of her long and still very much alive career.

In these days where there are alternatives to actually purchasing and owning a DVD you want to see, I decided to purchase this series because the DVDs that came with the rental places were so bashed up from heavy use that our DVD player would lock up, and my kindergartner who looks forward to ""Flipper time"" every Saturday morning really hates it when that happens.

See, Porter is the ranger for Coral Key Park and Reserve, and they live within the park.  Better yet, they have a pet dolphin they've named Flipper.

Life is never dull in the park.  There are crises of all kinds to face.  Natural dangers like shark attacks, two hurricanes, and poisonous snakes threaten the family and park visitors.  But human dangers are just as real.  How did a sunken car get in the middle of the preserve?  Who is stealing from visitor boats in the park?  Matters of the heart are even explored when Bud thinks that Porter's new friend is out to replace his dead mother and Sandy develops his first crush.

But through it all, it is Flipper who saves the day.  This heroic dolphin seems to understand his human family and know exactly what they need.  He's always showing up in the nick of time.

Let's be honest, this isn't great TV.  The acting is mediocre at best, and the writing is lazy quite a bit of time.  I can't count the number of episodes that drop or gloss over a plot point to make the time limit.  Plus the effects are rather cheesy most of the time.

But let's not count out the charm of the shows.  Even though I know the outcome (yes, this show is also predictable), I can get so caught up in the moment that I am on the edge of my seat.  Quite a few of these shows got my heart pumping.  And, while the spoken acting isn't that great, everyone does a good job of acting underwater.  I had never realized just how much of the show was done silent since humans can't talk while diving.  Yet I always followed the story.

And let's not leave out the scenery.  The underwater shots are quite often breathtakingly beautiful.

This set is packed full of underwater fun.  There are 30 episodes on four double sided DVD's.  While some of the material doesn't look so good, most of the episodes still look great.  The only extra is a trivia game, which is actually about dolphins in general and only marginally about the show.  I actually learned quite a bit from playing it.

At the end of the day, the fun of this show outweighs the negatives.  So if you have fond memories or love the water, get this set.  Just be prepared to put up with some cheese.",1208908800,6,2349,4.373549883990719

1207890,5,B00000F61N,"I buy a lot of TV shows on dvd, mostly older shows from my childhood (1960s and 1970s as well as shows from the 1950s that were rerun a lot when I was a child).  Sometimes the memory of a certain show is grander than the show itself.  A number of times I've put on a dvd only to wonder how it was that I ever found the show entertaining in the first place.  The Flipper dvd set has proven to be a nice exception to this, however.  Apart from the pretty bad acting delivered by the younger boy, the show is actually fairly well done.  Yes, the plots are predictable, but there's a certain charm to the entire affair that helps to mitigate that.

Oh, and Brian Kelly, who played the father, was quite a handsome man and has his shirt off in at least one scene in almost every episode.  What's not to like about that?",1203379200,,814,4.113924050632911

The transfers on these DVD's are quite nice although I wish they would have released Season 1 in Widescreen format.

I have Dish Network and they broadcast Flipper on Voom's Family Room channel in high-definition, it looks awesome and it gives the feeling of a much newer series.

Hopefully MGM will release Season 2 and 3 and if they do in Widescreen.

Contrary to what some people have posted and consequently left me negative feedback about, this show along with many at this time in our history was indeed shot in 35mm film with a wide aspect ratio, the shows on the now deceased channel Voom were presented in their widescreen glory and look marvelous.

I have the shows saved to an external HD and images/ video can be viewed to back up what I say.",1200960000,,833,4.348387096774194
1207892,4,B00000F61N,"I was born in '66, so I watched Flipper syndicated reruns almost every afternoon in the early 70s on WTCG-17 in Atlanta, GA, a small UHF station owned by Ted Turner, who of course went on to greater multi-media fame.

Because our family used to take annual summer vacations to Florida, this was a show that I could relate to and thoroughly enjoy.  I just purchased this first season set on DVD a couple of months ago and almost became misty eyed when the first episode started.  The picture quality is superb, the cinematography gorgeous - both above and under water, and the background mood music is very moving and effective.  With such a crisp clean soundtrack, the sounds of the gurgling exhaust from the boats make me think I'm right there on the water with them.

In a nutshell, Flipper is an aquatic version of Lassie.  This disc set gives you 30 episodes from the Fall of '64 to the Spring of '65.  Episode 3 is actually the series' pilot - notice how Sandy's voice hasn't quite changed in this episode and how younger the two boys look.  Also notice how skinny and in shape most of the series' characters are.  They weren't sitting on their assetts all day long playing computer games and watching TV.  They actually stayed active and swam.

The plots are fairly straightforward.  A suspenseful situation builds (either natural or man made), Rick Porter and the two boys try to solve it, and Flipper somehow always comes through to help save the day.  In one episode, Flipper retrieves a lost case of badly needed blood from the ocean floor while simultaneously fighting off a shark.  In another episode, Flipper fights off an alligator threatening the boys and a teen girl, etc.  You get the picture.

The series promotes good strong family values, such as the importance of working together as a family and as a team, the importance of school work, the fact that doing chores never killed anyone, and the importance of good strong decision making skills and of using one's brain.  This show also serves as a history book for what life in America was like back in the mid 60s.  Between the cars, the clothes, hairstyles, etc. it really makes for interesting viewing.  And because the show was filmed mostly on location in Florida and the Bahamas, it doesn't have that fake artificial Hollywood over produced look to it.  The on location shooting adds to the realism and authenticity of the show.  For instance, every car isn't a brand new '64/'65 model and many of the cars, boats, trailer homes, etc look weather beaten and dirty.  Real stuff.

My wife, who never saw Flipper while growing up, and our soon to be three year old daughter really enjoy this show.  We constantly watch it.  Some of the supense in a few of the episodes frightens my daughter, but she's learned by now that Flipper and Rick and the boys will always come out on top in the end.

I highly recommend supporting and purchasing this product so that maybe we can convince MGM Television to release seasons 2 and 3 of Flipper on DVD as well.  Get it today!",1200096000,3,3038,4.608938547486034

1207895,5,B00000F61N,"In addition to making available the popular TV series ""Flipper"" in DVD format, this set will certainly inspire appreciation and interest in one of early TV's successful teen actors.

Luke Halpin was already a veteran of TV and Broadway when he was cast in what would become his signature role. Athletic and astonishingly photogenic, Luke made the role of Sandy uniquely his own. Other actors have taken up the role, but none could compare with the original.

Previous posts have already stated most of my comments. This is a very good DVD transfer which has excellent color and picture quality. Owners of the old video releases of Flipper will welcome this set.

The 30 episodes of Season 1 are contained on two double-sided discs. This is a bare-bones package; no special features other than a Trivia Game. But if you just want to watch the series, this long-awaited package will not fail to please.

1207921,5,B00000F61N,"This is a welcome relief from the video-game world. Two boys, seemingly left all alone to play in the ocean all day, problem solve and have a great time. It is beautiful and engaging for elementary school aged kids--and this set of parents watched right along with them. Look at how much fun these boys have with absolutely nothing you can buy at the mall!

I hope they release the later seasons!

Very small caveat: only occasionally are there any women in this show, this is mostly all men and boys. When women do show up they may be scientists or athletes, but once or twice in this whole dvd you hear a 1960's-style comment about women that will make you wince a bit. Not enough to be a deal-breaker for me.

1207924,4,B00000F61N,"What can one say about this show? My assessment is a mixed bag. On the one hand I think highly of the show's setting, the characters, and the basic premise. On the other hand, I feel that it is lacking in some way. Flipper is about Porter Ricks, a park ranger in Coral Key Park, Florida, and his two sons, Sandy and Bud. The show chronicles the various adventures of living in the park and how Flipper always finds a way to rescue people and/or persuade people with his charm.  I had high hopes for Flipper because overall it embodies many of the attributes I like to see on television: honesty, loyalty, hard work, courage, leadership, and a nurturing family environment. The production values are pretty good for the time. The underwater photography is really good. Overall the show seems to have the correct recipe for success. When the show debuted in 1964, it finished number 25 in the TV ratings. The following two seasons did not place in the top 25. The main problem I have with the show is the script writing. I know that I might ruffle some feathers with the Flipper fans but some of the stories are not that entertaining and some are just downright silly. I think the overall plots are good but something happened between the concept stage and the script writing phase. Don't get me wrong, the Flipper shows are much better than the garbage seen on television today. However, some episodes seem to drag on and lose the interest of my children. On the flipside, there are some episodes that are action-packed and very suspenseful and they keep my kids riveted to the TV screen. There are far more good episodes than bad ones. Because of this inconsistency I can't give Flipper 5 stars. Since the overall production values are good and the theme of the show highlights good morals and values, it doesn't deserve a rating as low as 3 stars either. Therefore, I am giving Flipper 4 stars. It's not a classic but it is well worth the money and I recommend it.",1188518400,8,1965,4.5508474576271185

1207927,5,B00000F61N,"Flipper Season 1 kindles those fond old memories of childhood.  It is rare today that quality stories are shared in an all family atmosphere.
The behavior of all of the characters set standards that would be wonderful goals for todays youth.  Even my grandchildren love the stories and choose them over recent releases!  Refreshing that todays youth can be reached and influenced without belching contests (Nick on Nickelodian),
brats that make fun of an overweight girl (Zac & Cody on Suite Life), and
cursing, rude animated characters.  I think marketers/producers don't spend enough energy on ""good"" kids, and understand the negative impact that their choices have on children.  (or probably don't care).

I, for one, will vote for quality with my dollars as I'm sure many other baby boomers will do also.  Flipper wouldn't swim in a gutter and neither should we!!!

1207963,5,B00000F61N,"Well, when I was a boy, right in there with ""Leave It To Beaver"", ""Astro Boy"", ""Gilligan's Island"" and a host of other shows was Flipper!  How can anyone hate Flipper?  Bottled nosed dolphins are the most beautiful of all the dolphins I think in the ocean.  I guess allot of other people think so too.

What made this chemistry great were the two boys in the series, Luke Halpin, who played Sandy Ricks, and Tommy Norden, who played Bud Ricks. The heart of the show was carried by the characters Bud and Flipper.  Tommy is one cute kid to look at physically, which adds to the drawing power and physical beauty of the show, espeically when he is with Flipper.  You read of old tales where man trained dolphins to help with life's ordeals and needs. Given how smart, and almost human, the dolphin is with what is known today, it isn't hard to believe the adventures of Bud Ricks and Flipper when you watch this old series. Since I was the youngest brother in my own family, having only one older brother, I could equate to the Ricks family, especially when growing up mostly with my Dad.  I mostly identified with Tommy's character Bud, as a result and often dreamed as a boy having a dolphin of my own one day.  Thank God for imagination!

There was nothing complex with this TV series.  It's all good clean fun.  The dangers Bud and his brother Sandy face are serious, but always resolve; with Flipper usually saving the day.  I had forgotten there are some guest appearances by Andy Devine in some of the episodes.  Andy Devine was an old time character actor, even before I was born.  He plays an old sea captain, whose yarns are as big as his heart full of love for Bud. Reminds me of my love for my own grandfather on my mom' side of the family.  Except his stories were true when he told them.  There is very little violence is this series with nothing but good down to earth character development as you watch each episode. Nothing is boring.  This is something you can show to your kids and they will enjoy.

This package shows the first season in great restored condition and in excellent color.  Everything looks new, like when it first aired. For someone my age, it was a treat when the first DVD went into my machine and I could hear the old opening theme song being sung.

There's no doubt that this is a show for kids, but I'm enjoying it as an adult.  This show is just plain relaxing.  No cellphones, no computers, no traffic jams or high-speed car chases, no demons or superpowers, no serial killers--there's just the ocean, beaches, trees, park rangers, boys, and a very cool dolphin...and some sharks and poachers, of course, but hey, you have to some kind of dramatic tension.

These are the much hated two-sided discs, there's no booklet or additional information, and no real special features--it's a bare bones set.  But as I said--it's gorgeous to look at and relaxing, very relaxing.  When you pop in a disc to watch an episode or two, the tensions of the day dissolve away and you start smiling.

The quality of the stories is also top notch.  There are some lessons and some high moral values imparted.  Also, the underwater photography was clearly done by experts.
