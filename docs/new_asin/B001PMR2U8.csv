8333913,5,B001PMR2U8,This is a collection of different skill-building exercises to help improve dexterity and hand coordination..,1415232000,,108,6.266666666666667
8333914,5,B001PMR2U8,"No songs are covered here. This is a collection of different skill-building exercises to help improve your playing. It is organized into 3 different routines, with the recommendation to spend about a month on each routine in a continuously rotating fashion. Mr. McCarthy is a good teacher with a good attitude. all the exercises are useful and the fact that there are 3 different routines keeps things from being boring. This is a good, solid program to study.",1404518400,,460,4.910256410256411

8333916,5,B001PMR2U8,"John McCarthy rules!!!
I wish these instructional DVDs were around when I was a kid. My hands are trashed from windsurfing and kite boarding so speed on the fret board suffers a lot. These exercises have really helped me loosen up and do other stuff than the same licks over and over again.",1310860800,5,290,4.490566037735849
8333917,5,B001PMR2U8,"I own 5 of the Rock House DVDs and this is the one I use the most.  I am starting out in guitar so as I get better then I will probably start using the others more.  This is actually the first one that I recommend for the beginning player to get.  The reasons for this is that it has 3 routines.  The DVD says you practice each one for 2-4 weeks before moving onto the next routine.  Once you have completed all 3 then you can start back at the first one.  If you can do all 3 of these routines with proficiency then you can already make some cool music.  These routines take about 30 min and will build hand strength and speed for both your picking and fretting hand.  The routines are also fun and I like the choice of music that you are making.  The one hand rolls sound great (kind of like a light version right hand fretting).  Anyway I really like the sound of many of the routines and would be happy just playing them.

Another reviewer mentioned you can find all of this info on the web.  While that is probably true, it is nice that it is all presented in one location in a well presented and thought out manor.  You can probably teach your self to play by just searching the web but you will still probably pay someone to teach you at some point.

Also, the production values are first rate, I think the included booklet is exceptionally helpful.  Also, included is an iPod ready video and lifetime membership to the website.  I have not really found how to make the most of the website yet so I am not sure how helpful that is.

Anyway, I really have no desire to play rhythm sections and this program is great for strengthening my hands and teaching me skills to play lead pieces.",1286755200,10,1692,4.204968944099379
8333918,5,B001PMR2U8,"At first I thought John McCarthy's exercises and strength training techniques for guitar were too rudimentary.  But, I was fooled by it's simplicity.  Mccarthy's training techniques are awesome and the way he shows you within his instruction is superb in comparison to any mainstream or well-known exercise videos or literature out there.",1267142400,6,338,5.480769230769231
