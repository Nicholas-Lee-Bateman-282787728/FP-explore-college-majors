8623051,1,B00GGZ7YM0,"This is not a good dvd and no doubt Neil would agree.  He certainly did not approve this dvd or have anything to do with it.
It consists of 4 or 5 reviewers commenting on Neil's albums up to 1986 and nothing after that.
In the background, you see NY and CH playing at the Cow Palace in 86, but the focus is not on the concert, but the reviews.
The audio and video of the concert is horrible.
Don't waste your money on this one.",1513900800,,427,3.9651162790697674
