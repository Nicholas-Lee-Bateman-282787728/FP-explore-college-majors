8453367,1,B0051WTNKA,"Almost every hometown has a Shamrock Hill the opening voiceover tells us.  A shoddy, old place with an abandoned house where the kids like to congregate.  Eileen(Peggy Ryan) is not a child in years but she is an innocnet at heart who loves to hang out at the Hill and weave magical stories that mesmerize the kids.  The richest man in town owns the Hill and wants to build a television station there.  He considers Eileen a nuisance and has her arrested for trespassing.  But his lawyer is smitten with the spunky young woman and gets the charges dismissed.  The rest of the movie details tiny giant killer Eileen's attempts to slay the giant rich man and save the Hill for the tykes.  She succeeds, of course, and also wins Larry(Ray McDonald) for a boyfriend and even unites the lawyer with the rich man's daughter.  Great musicals have been built on even more anorexic plots than this but great musicals have great songs and dances.  ""Shamrock Hill"" does not.  Ryan and McDonald make lively fun of ""Today Is A Fine, Fine Day"" . The number could have been a showstopper but the miniscule set makes it drab and confined.  The film's best moment, McDonald's ""angry"" dance, is missing from this print(as are several other songs and dances).  And there's a fantasy ballet sequence that cries out for dreamy airiness but  instead it is dark and creepy.  It looks like an escapee from a German Expressionist film.  ""Cheap"" is the best word to describe ""Shamrock Hill"".  The special effects are laughable and some of the sets look like cardboard.  The dark, gloomy lighting gives a movie that needed sugar spun sweetness a cramped, dreary, heavy feel.  It is as if the producers thought they could hide the movie's low budget by keeping things dim.

IMO, Peggy Ryan and Ray McDonald were the movies best dance team(and, no, I haven't forgotten about Fred and Ginger).  Ryan is best known for the teen musicals she did with Donald O'Connor at Universal.  Peggy described those movies as having low budgets but they must have seemed downright luxurious compared to ""Shamrock Hill"".  Ray McDonald's fall into this mess must have been even more vertiginous:  he was once part of Hollywood's most exhaulted movie musical unit, the Freed Unit at MGM.  But if either was unhappy making ""Shamrock Hill"" they didn't show it.  Both do their best.  The pair is always worth watching but how you wish they had something worthy of their talents.

This movie is made to order and the poor picture quality(blurry) and sound quality(muted in places) do nothing to make the film more enjoyable.

""Shamrock Hill "" has a bit of a cult following as many TV stations used to show it every St. Patrick's Day.  Wait for the next viewing and don't waste your money on this.",1365033600,,2744,4.705882352941177
