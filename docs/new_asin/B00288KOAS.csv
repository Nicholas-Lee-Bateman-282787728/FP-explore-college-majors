8355898,1,B00288KOAS,"Wish I had read the details - the price is right for what you get, but what you get is from the 1990's! It claims to be made for very young children, yet the vocabulary and dialogue would be more appropriate for 9-10 year olds.  (I'm a teacher).  Not impressed at all.  I think the price reflects someone's need to get rid of some outdated, unwanted stock.",1391558400,,356,4.2835820895522385
8355899,4,B00288KOAS,"My 2 year old son adores this DVD. He is obsessed with fire trucks and the additional segment about construction vehicles included on the DVD also is a big hit. The DVD is dry and dull for adults watching. It gets relatively technical and has a very dated look, circa 80s I'd say. However, again I must say that my son watches it and requests it repeatedly. He even talks about Steve Pool when we play with his fire trucks.",1274140800,,423,4.3
