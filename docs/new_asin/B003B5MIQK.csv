8393482,5,B003B5MIQK,Wonderful way to keep learning Lindy! We are enjoying very much! :),1432598400,,67,4.666666666666667
8393483,4,B003B5MIQK,"Hello, i'm french and this is bery difficult to find a good DVD about Lindy Hop dance. This collection is very interesting for me because i have some bases of Lindy hop and no dancing room nearby. So this volume is very good for me to progress.

bonjour &agrave; tous, n'ayant pas de cours de danse pr&egrave;s de chez moi et cherchant sur le net des dvd de danse de lindy hop, je conseille cette collection, surtout si vous avez quelques bases d&eacute;j&agrave;, soit en rock, soit id&eacute;lament en lindy. C'est notre cas et je ne regrette pas l'achat.",1390780800,,557,4.626262626262626
8393484,5,B003B5MIQK,"I'm not a totally beginner, taken some classes over the last 2 years or so, thought i was progressing fairly well. Then I decided to get this series (1, 2 & 3 vids total) and it totally took me to the next level. The instruction is solid, easy to grasp and follow, and now my dance repertoire has expanded very quickly! I'm excited to get out and show off the moves I learned. I loved the focus on the Charleston in video 2, and all the advanced moves in video 3 really brought my swing to electric level. Highly recommend for dancing beginners to advanced. Amazing wealth of knowledge in this series. Great bang for my buck.",1333411200,,625,4.35042735042735
8393485,5,B003B5MIQK,"Most of these moves are great although some of these moves I don't like, but they teach a lot in this 2.5 hour DVD, so pick and choose your heart away.  It flows quite well and I'm getting a huge boost in my dance moves as a lead rather quickly!  Look out follows!!! LOL  If you are at least intermediate, I strongly recommend this! If you teach swing, I strongly recommend this!  My only complaint is there is almost no slides shown and certainly none in the titles intentionally taught.  New Volume for slides?!? LOL",1325203200,,518,4.410526315789474
8393486,5,B003B5MIQK,"I know other dancers will probably give me flack for this, but before I got this series I'd never really heard about Lindy Hop. But I really liked Daniel's other DVDs from Motion Lifestyle, so I thought ""what they hey"".

I'm really happy I did. Lindy Hop is great! Maybe even my new favorite! I really like to take these moves to the club. I wish I would have gotten the set all at once though, as I skipped the second DVD at first. But it would have been smart to get them in order or just get the series. Lesson learned, there's a reason they put them in the order they do. :)

But seriously, Lindy Hop is great. If you like to dance, you'll love learning this style. Which is pretty easy on DVD, all things considered. :)",1307577600,,724,4.164285714285715
8393487,5,B003B5MIQK,Ok so after buying the first two volumes I had to buy the 3rd. After learning all the basics from the first 2 my dance partner and I moved to up to the third volume. Luckily the more complicated steps from this dvd were explained as thoroughly as the first two and we were able to really slow down and get the moves right. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who either bought the first two or who knows about the basics of lindy hop!,1307404800,2,442,4.151162790697675
